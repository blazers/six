</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williamson, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1633&#150;1701), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was born on 25 July 1633 and baptized in the parish church of Bridekirk, Cumberland, on 4 August 1633. He was the second surviving son of Joseph Williamson (<i>d</i>. 1634), vicar to the parish in 1625, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowman. The Williamson family was native to Cumberland and also had connections with Millbeck Hall that lay 2 miles north of Keswick. In 1671 Sir Daniel Fleming noted that this was the &#145;ancient seat of the Williamsons&#146;  (Hughes, 48).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Williamson was educated locally at St Bees grammar school in Cumberland. He proved bright and reliable enough to secure the patronage of the local member of parliament, Richard Tolson, who took him to London in the late 1640s as his clerk and part-time amanuensis. Through Tolson's interest Williamson was admitted to Westminster School in 1648. Under Dr Richard Busby he learned discipline and hard work, traits prominent in his later character. He was recommended to Gerard Langbaine the elder, provost of Queen's College, Oxford, as a deserving youth from the north country. In September 1650 he entered Queen's as a &#145;battellor&#146; or &#145;servitor&#146; to the provost. Williamson's time at Queen's made a great impact upon him and he always proved loyal both to the college and its members. Indeed he was one of the college's most generous benefactors: in his lifetime he sponsored building work, gave it numerous gifts, including a massive silver trumpet used to summon the college to dinner, and founded an Anglo-Saxon lectureship there, ensuring that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; William Nicolson received the post. Anthony Wood claimed that Williamson was a great friend and benefactor to Queen's men and that Thomas Barlow and Thomas Lamplugh, among others, received bishoprics through his friendship. During his early years there, however, Williamson seems to have lived in some poverty&#151;a factor which might account for his later ambition and greed, noted by contemporaries, for financial rewards. He graduated BA in February 1654 and MA by diploma in 1657. He then served in France from 1655 to 1658 as a tutor to some young men of quality including Richard Lowther and one of the marquess of Ormond's sons. Williamson's continental sojourn had ended by June 1658 when he returned to Oxford to take up a fellowship at Queen's and an academic career. He had already proved an active and popular tutor with musical tastes and a busy social life. With the Restoration of 1660, however, he gained employment in the new government.<br>
<br>In July 1660 the king sent the master and fellows a special request for dispensation for Williamson to grant him leave from the college and he left for Whitehall to take up the post of under-secretary to the secretary of state for the south, Sir Edward Nicholas, a post he may have gained with the assistance of Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London. Williamson always retained a sense of obligation to Nicholas for bringing him from Oxford to the centre of power, and he later wrote that he was ever &#145;sensible &hellip; of [the secretary of state's] goodness to me when I was yet young and low in &hellip; service&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2539, fols. 142&#150;3). He also felt it was a sign of divine favour, for &#145;God&#146;, he pointed out, was the &#145;real author of every good and perfect gift&#146;  (ibid.). His motives for taking service in government were the usual mixture of personal ambition, social advancement, and desire for wealth. Certainly Williamson was never slow in taking any financial opportunities that presented themselves, and by 1668 he was rumoured to have an estate of some &pound;40,000 in ready money.<br>
<br>Williamson's significance grew owing to his &#145;knowledge of worldly affairs&#146; and also because his new master was &#145;less and less able to perform his duties of office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lorenzo Magalotti</span>, 44). His subsequent rise as an administrator was rapid and the burden of work in the office fell upon him. He also took every opportunity to widen both his position and his duties, however much administrative drudgery this entailed. In December 1661 he was appointed keeper of the king's library at Whitehall and of the state paper office with a salary of &pound;160 per annum. With Nicholas's replacement in October 1662 by Sir Henry Bennet (from 1663 Lord Arlington) Williamson was widely regarded as the intimate favourite of the old secretary and, according to Lorenzo Magalotti, the first thing Bennet did was to dismiss Williamson at once from the secretariat. However, if this event ever took place, Williamson was immediately reinstated because Bennet soon realized that it was impossible to run the office without Williamson as he had so integrated himself in its work. From that point on Williamson retained the confidence of the new secretary and he remained in his post until 9 September 1674. Lord Craven, writing in 1673, noted that Williamson was one of the &#145;deserving knights of the age for his experience in both forane and domestique concernes&#146; and that he was &#145;greatly valued &hellip; and in [Arlington's] &hellip; highest confidences&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 81/60/61, fol. 87).<br>
<br>Williamson proved to be one of the new, more methodical, bureaucrats to emerge after 1660. For some years he was a central cog in the machinery of the secretaries' offices and his influence on those public servants that were his contemporaries may well have been more widespread than is generally thought. His prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in government included Robert Yard, William Blathwayt, Matthew Prior, William Bridgeman, and James Vernon, who all contributed to the administrative revolution of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. While little by way of technical innovation can be traced to Williamson, much by way of order and method was imposed on the secretary of state's office: Williamson's &#145;Shopp [that dealt] with all ye parts of ye Business of my Trade&#146;  (Magrath, 1.199). A less cavalier attitude towards paperwork, knowledge of precedents, strict discipline in office practice, division of labour and a systematic order, with a methodical eye for detail and some delegation, were among the elements imposed by Williamson on the working practices of the office.<br>
<br>The eagerness to control administrative activities also led Williamson into other areas, among them the gathering of intelligence to counter the innumerable plots of the early 1660s and to supply information for the foreign policy decisions of the 1670s. This activity included intercepting the mail at the Post Office, as well as examining and interrogating suspects, and employing spies and informers. Williamson was in effect the <i>de facto</i> head of the Restoration government's intelligence system. In this work too he applied his usual thoroughness, following in the footsteps of earlier intelligence chiefs such as Sir Francis Walsingham, Thomas Scot, and John Thurloe. He shared the fears of the government, writing: &#145;I find a spirit of malice hath every where insinuated fears &amp; jealousies in to the people, w[hi]ch it must be the care of &hellip; prudent men to exorcise &amp; cast out, ere it possesse them too farre&#146;  (Magrath, 1.160). The dissemination of official information was also carried out through establishing a manuscript newsletter system run from Williamson's office and the foundation in 1666 of the <span class="italic">Oxford Gazette</span> (later the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>). The <span class="italic">Gazette</span> had originated with Henry Muddiman and Roger L'Estrange but Williamson soon undercut his rivals, using underhand methods and working on the philosophy that if there had to be newspapers then they should emanate from the government and contain as little illuminating news for the public as possible. His main aim was to take intelligence-gathering into his own hands where it could be of use both for his patron, Arlington, and the state.<br>
<br>Williamson also acquired a number of offices and perquisites: he was a member and then master (1675&#150;7) of the Clothworkers' Company, commissioner for lotteries in 1665, and a justice of the peace. He received an honorary call to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1664. Even with the patronage of Arlington, however, he found difficulty at first in entering parliament. He failed at Morpeth in October 1666, Preston (1667), and Dartmouth 1667, and his attempt to gain a seat at Appleby, then in the gift of Lady Pembroke, led to the myth of the celebrated but undoubtedly fraudulent rejection allegedly sent to Arlington: &#145;I have been bullied by a usurper. I have been neglected by a Court, but I will not be dictated to by a subject. Your man shan't stand&#146;  (Williamson, 289). The true version, written to Williamson in January 1668, was that she had a &#145;prior engagement upon me, both for my own grandchildren &hellip; and some of my own kindred and friends in this&#146;  (ibid.). Williamson eventually found a seat through Arlington's interest in Thetford, being elected on 22 October 1669, for which he sat in all the parliaments from 1669 to 1685. His activities as an MP were important but he was ill at ease with the cut and thrust of debate. Alongside Thomas, Lord Clifford, Williamson was used as one of Arlington's managers of the Commons in the abortive attempt to create a court party in the latter half of the 1660s. At the same time, while Arlington occupied himself with the higher matters of foreign affairs and court politics, Williamson managed the secretary's office with a voluminous correspondence and mountains of paper and thereby grew rich in status and wealth.<h2>
<a name="Diplomatandsecretaryofstate"></a>Diplomat and secretary of state</h2>In January 1672 Williamson received the post of clerk of the privy council and on 24 January he was knighted. On 1 March he became an honorary member of Lincoln's Inn. He was prominent in the activities surrounding the declaration of indulgence of March 1672, profitably organizing the distribution of licences for the nonconformist community. At the same time he also organized the intelligence-gathering activities of the regime prior to the outbreak of the third war with the Dutch. With the war going badly for the English, the mediation of Sweden was accepted in the spring of 1673 and a congress between the parties was arranged at Cologne. Williamson was selected to act as one of the plenipotentiaries, and Arlington's voice, in the congress of Cologne. He left England on 17 May 1673 with Sir Leoline Jenkins as his fellow plenipotentiary. Williamson engaged in many diplomatic debates in Cologne and just as many social activities; he was noted for his fondness for dancing into the early hours. One highlight of his stay was his appearance at a masked ball dressed in a green satin robe with silver ornaments and attended by four noblemen. Other than an increase in Williamson's sartorial elegance, for which he was well known in any case, little else was achieved at the congress. He returned from his embassy on 15 April 1674. While on the homeward journey down the Rhine the plenipotentiary's craft was shot at by accident and Williamson came close to being hit, but the rest of his return passed uneventfully. By the time he returned to London arrangements had been made for his promotion to the post of secretary of state. He was appointed to the position and sworn of the privy council on 11 September 1674 at the age of forty-one.<br>
<br>The negotiations for the post of secretary of state had been prolonged and were part of Arlington's plan to stay in power at court by moving to the post of lord chamberlain and leaving the more exposed political place of secretary of state to a client. Despite Williamson's loyalty Arlington secretly offered the place to Sir William Temple, and only when Temple had refused did Arlington, for the sum of &pound;6000, give up the post to Williamson. Williamson saw it as &#145;the great business of my life&#146;, although in retrospect it may have been a move too far, for Williamson was to be far from happy and often subject to the caprice of the new power at court&#151;the recently appointed lord treasurer, Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby  (TNA: PRO, SP 105/221, pp. 207&#150;8).<br>
<br>As power passed to Danby, Williamson also began to drift this way and gradually deserted his former patron. In any event, as secretary of state he was no Arlington, and his dominance of office proceedings was never matched by the same self-assurance in the political quicksand of the court. The government was Danby's regime and Williamson soon became a functionary within it. Initially Danby believed that Williamson, as a client of Arlington, had been intriguing against him while in Cologne in 1673 and assumed little trust could be placed in him. In 1677 Lady Danby was attempting to persuade her lord that he &#145;should not rely on any of my Lord Arlington's renegades&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.385). The lord treasurer was also prone to keep the secretary waiting outside his office for some two hours before admitting him. This could be seen as a calculated snub to a man who became increasingly touchy about such matters. Danby, however, was intent on controlling the Commons and Williamson's many contacts, gained through his extensive correspondence and newsletter system, and organizational skills, were among those used in Danby's attempt to create a court party in the later 1670s. Williamson himself spoke at length for the government in the Commons. It was often believed that his speeches were deliberately dull in order to empty out the Commons and enable the regime to take important votes on supply, but it is equally likely that, as other commentators of the day noted, his oratorical skills were cumbersome and he resorted to unwarranted flattery on inappropriate occasions. Williamson did not follow Danby in all things. The attempt by the lord treasurer to remove his rival Shaftesbury from the scene in 1676 led to Williamson's refusal to sign the warrant that would have sent the earl to the Tower.<br>
<br>Williamson continued to prevent awkward or inflammatory ideas from reaching the public domain. In 1676, when Milton's last amanuensis, Daniel Skinner, attempted to publish the poet's &#145;Latin state letters&#146; and &#145;De doctrina Christiana&#146;, Williamson emphatically intervened. The writings of &#145;that late villain Milton&#146; in Williamson's opinion were subversive, and he seized control of the manuscripts  (TNA: PRO, SP 104/66, fol. 120). Skinner was seen as deluded and warned off, while the manuscripts subsequently disappeared into the state paper office to reside there in obscurity until they were rediscovered in 1823.<br>
<br>Williamson's increased social and political status was confirmed on 30 November 1677 when the Royal Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1663, elected him as its second president, though he was chosen president more for his court connections than any scientific abilities and he rarely attended the society's meetings. He may not, however, have been entirely uninterested in its work: he had undertaken extra tuition in natural philosophy and chemistry from Peter Stael at Oxford in his youth, and in November 1677 Robert Hooke wrote that he had spoken to Williamson of mathematical instruments and algebra and had been shown Sir Joseph's Chinese abacus. Williamson also had interests in literature, heraldry and antiquarian ideas&#151;his private papers show endless workings out of the ages of the early biblical prophets and kings of Israel.<h2>
<a name="Fallfromoffice"></a>Fall from office</h2>In 1678 the so-called Popish Plot engulfed the government, including Williamson. Of Williamson's own view of the plot there is little evidence. The various glimpses that do exist show some scepticism as to its genuineness, but it soon became impolitic, at least in public, to express any real doubts in the plot. He was involved in its investigations at an early stage and took some interest in the mystery surrounding the death of Edmund Godfrey, interviewing in person the coroner who sat on the inquest. Williamson was also in contact with the major informers of the day. Of Israel Tonge, Williamson thought he was merely an eccentric seeking an office in the church. Bedloe's flattery of Williamson that he was one whom the Jesuits &#145;looked upon &hellip; as an enemy&#146; was also treated with coolness  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 3). Of Oates, Williamson generally remained wary, especially after the latter's spectacular rise to power and his predilection for inventing accusations against alleged popish conspirators. In the event the hysteria from the plot soon spilled over into the Commons, and it was there that Williamson had his career wrecked.<br>
<br>Williamson, like many ministers of the period, was a victim of the fear of Catholics and Irish Catholics in particular. In the course of the crisis it was revealed that some Irish Catholic officers had been given warrants excusing them from taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, despite the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, and that Williamson had counter-signed these documents as secretary of state. The outraged Commons ignored Williamson's prevarication that such papers had often been brought all in a bundle and that he had counter-signed them in haste. His other claim, that the whole fiasco was the result of the behaviour of the duke of Monmouth who had pressed this course of action upon him, was also ignored. The Commons speedily consigned him to the Tower on 18 November 1678, only for him to be released after a few hours by an angry Charles II. It was then, however, obvious to the monarch that Williamson's political value had declined, especially as Williamson apparently avoided attending the Commons for some time after this incident. This eventually led to his replacement as secretary of state on 20 February 1679 by the earl of Sunderland (but with the assurance that the &pound;6000 Williamson had originally paid for the office would be refunded to him).<h2>
<a name="Latercareerandfinalyears"></a>Later career and final years</h2>With his involvement in public life temporarily in eclipse, Williamson chose this moment, 12 February 1679, to marry Catherine O'Brien (1640&#150;1702), daughter of George Stuart, ninth seigneur d'Aubigny; she was <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Clifton, and heir to her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26696/', "Charles Stuart, third duke of Richmond")</script>. It is not clear whether this was a love match, although they had long been acquainted and, given the haste of the marriage, it is possible that they were lovers prior to the death of her husband Henry O'Brien, Lord Ibracken, on 1 October 1678. The disparity in their social status (Catherine being a baroness and related to the king) caused much criticism of the marriage and even gossip that it had caused Williamson's political demise, Danby intending his own son for Catherine. However, this rumour was unlikely and, contrary to the scurrilous report of John Evelyn, the pair seem to have had a reasonably happy marriage. They had no children (although Williamson appears to have had an illegitimate son, Joseph Hornsby, to whom he left his Cumberland estates). The wealthy Williamson subsequently spent some years organizing his wife's indebted estates in England and Ireland. He also took over her debts in 1689 and finally purchased outright his wife's property, Cobham Hall in Kent, in 1696. Williamson was not completely out of royal favour. He voted against exclusion, but was otherwise inactive in those parliaments. A visit to Ireland in 1680 led to his appointment to the Irish privy council and he retained his local influence in Kent. He remained as MP for Thetford in 1685 and spent some money on public buildings there to maintain his interest. Yet under James II his fortunes declined once more. He was dropped from the Irish privy council and refused to support the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Although Williamson did not explicitly welcome the revolution of 1688, and was defeated in the 1689 elections, he did not give up his interest at Thetford, buying a town house there and making other various gifts to the corporation, but in 1690 he was elected for Rochester; he represented the town in three subsequent parliaments, until October 1701, despite being also elected for Thetford in 1695 and 1698. In the 1690 parliament he was classed as a tory and court supporter, sat on several important committees, and was from the outset prominent in the debates of the Commons, holding an essentially tory outlook on events.<br>
<br>Ill health occasionally marred these years, but the favour of the new king to Williamson was assured in 1691 when William III made an overnight stop at Cobham Hall while on his way to the continent. Williamson's continued support of the court in the Commons naturally followed and there were soon rumours that he was to be appointed lord privy seal, but this never took place. Instead, in 1692 he was elected to the Irish parliament. He was once more sworn as an Irish privy councillor and remained in Ireland until December 1695 as a parliamentary manager. Back in Westminster in January 1696 he continued to support the court in the new session. He also returned to the privy council in November 1696. He then became one of the plenipotentiaries for the peace conference at Rijswijk (Ryswick). He embarked in May 1697 accompanied by his wife, four secretaries and, or so popular rumour had it, six fiddlers. His experience in diplomatic work made him an obvious choice for the king in an era when experienced English diplomats whom William III could trust were few. Although wracked with gout and ill health, Williamson retained the confidence of the king and after the signature of the peace in September 1697 he remained in Europe as ambassador to The Hague. He spent the whole of 1698 abroad, arriving back in England only in July 1699, once more securing his interest at Rochester. In 1700 and 1701 Williamson was frequently unwell and he missed the fierce criticism that fell on the king's ministers over revelations on the partition treaty. By 2 September 1701 he was seriously ill and he finally succumbed at Cobham Hall on 3 October 1701. He was buried on 14 October 1701 in the duke of Richmond's vault in Westminster Abbey. His legacies were extensive: &pound;5000 was bequeathed for the building a free school at Rochester for educating boys in mathematics for use in naval service, and Thetford was given &pound;2000. Queen's College received &pound;6000 and his library, and the Royal Society &pound;200. Nor was his family forgotten and a tangled legacy, particularly after the death of his widow on 3 November 1702, for Joseph Hornsby, complicated the estate's finances.<h2>
<a name="Summation"></a>Summation</h2>The life of Williamson from 1660 onwards was largely public. He was a man of business and affairs who served the Restoration and post-1688 government well. His reputation as an administrator has recently been revised and he was possibly more influential in this area than was once thought. He was also active in the world of intelligence and espionage in an era of plotting and conspiracy, and appears to have had a shrewd eye for intelligence-gathering activities. As a man Williamson gained the reputation for dryness and formality in his public dealings, albeit he was capable of enormous flattery to those he wished to impress. There was equally an unofficial, sociable, side that cared for music and dancing. He remained throughout a shrewd and ambitious man, eager, if not greedy, for wealth and public status.<br>
