<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chapman,  (Anthony) Colin Bruce</span>  (1928&#150;1982), <span class="occ">racing car designer and motor manufacturer</span>, was born at Richmond, Surrey, on 19 May 1928, the only son of Stanley Frank Kennedy-Chapman, licensed caterer, of Muswell Hill, and his wife, (Lillian) Mary Bruce. Having been educated at the Stationers' School, Hornsey, he then graduated BSc at University College, London. For a technological buccaneer and the most innovative of formula 1 designers, who spent much of his life doing battle with authority, he made a surprisingly placid start to a turbulent professional life. Reading civil engineering because he thought it would be easier, he specialized in structural engineering. Combined with a lifelong interest in aeronautics, this stood him in good stead in producing cars well known for their lightness.<br>
<br>Fast cars, flying, and competitiveness in everything he did were the mainsprings of Chapman's life. After gaining his private pilot's licence with his university air squadron he accepted a short service commission with the RAF. But cars were his first love and by 1948 the first Chapman car based on the Austin 7, known as the Lotus Mark 1, was completed. He soon discovered that his m&eacute;tier lay in cars for circuit racing (in which he excelled) rather than for trials, and in ingenious interpretation of the rules governing their construction. His budding Lotus so dominated the 1951 season of 750 formula racing that the regulations were changed to close the engine loophole he had exploited. The mould for twenty-five years of motor racing endeavour was set. Chapman would bring out some world-beating racing car only to have it eclipsed the following season when his rivals had caught up, copied, refined, and developed it while he had lost interest and moved on to his next design. His formula 1 cars won seventy-two grand prix, achieved eighty-eight pole positions and sixty-three fastest laps, took the constructors' championship seven times, were runners-up five times, and provided a seat for five world champion drivers. Only Ferrari approached this record. As with Enzo Ferrari's team, there were also the long lean periods, mainly because Chapman's full attention was elsewhere or because he was stubbornly pursuing an avant-garde design that would never be sanctioned.<br>
<br>Ironically, Chapman's first grand prix victory, the 1960 Monaco grand prix, was achieved not by a works driver but by Stirling Moss, who was so impressed by the Lotus&#150;Climax that he asked his sponsor, Rob Walker, to buy him one. But it was Jim Clark, the 1963 and 1965 world champion, who was to dominate the 1500 cc formula and establish Lotus as the marque to beat in the 3 litre formula before his tragic and untimely death on the Hockenheim track (1968). The 1965 Dutch grand prix found Chapman spending a night in the cells of Zandvoort police station after having felled an officious policeman, who had not seen his pass and ordered him off the track before the start of the race. This unfortunate incident, which received much publicity at the time, somehow symbolized Chapman's frequent clashes with the sport's governing body, the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale Sporting Automobile: Chapman doing something which he knew he was perfectly entitled to do with authority trying to stop him. But the same year Clark won the Indianapolis 500, as well as the formula 1 title.<br>
<br>The first year of the 3 litre formula belonged to the Brabham team with their stopgap but reliable Repco engine. But Chapman was waiting for the Ford&#150;Cosworth DFV engine for his Lotus 49, which won first time out and went on to power another forty-seven Lotus victories. Chapman was shattered by Clark's death and when Mike Spence was killed in practice for the Indianapolis 500 soon after, he was almost ready to quit. Sadly there were to be yet more tragedies in Lotus cars to come. The talented Austrian Jochen Rindt, the sport's first posthumous world champion, was to die at Monza, as was Ronnie Peterson, of Sweden, one of the great drivers never to win the title. Despite these disasters, Lotus were able to attract top drivers and Emerson Fittipaldi won the drivers' championship in 1972. But only with the American veteran Mario Andretti could Chapman establish something of the rapport he had had with Jim Clark.<br>
<br>In the Lotus 78, Andretti had an almost unfair advantage in his championship-winning year of 1978. Chapman had exploited the phenomenon of ground effect, shaping the undersides of his cars to generate down-force and enclosing them with side skirts. This was such a novel departure that other teams could not rebuild their cars in time that season but it was destined to be Chapman's last great year, with eight Lotus victories. While other teams refined their own ground-effect cars, Chapman moved on to his next revolutionary development, the type 88 twin-chassis car with the driver and essential components suspended in a kind of &#145;sprung cab&#146;. This was too much and other teams threatened to withdraw from the 1981 Long Beach grand prix if the Lotus was allowed to race. The ban on the 88 soured Chapman and even his natural ebullience seemed crushed. For three years Lotus won no races as sponsorship and other problems mounted. Meanwhile, the Lotus road car business was in serious financial trouble. A world authority on the use of composite materials, pioneered in his formula 1 cars, Chapman had somehow found time to become entangled in the ill-fated project to build DeLorean sports cars in Northern Ireland. This unfortunate connection did his reputation no good, although nothing can detract from his record as, in Enzo Ferrari's words, a &#145;subtle visionary &hellip; able to produce ideas ahead of their time&#146;.<br>
<br>Inspirer of great loyalty as well as dislike, endearing or devious according to the viewpoint, Chapman left an indelible mark on the summit of motor racing. Of medium height, with penetrating blue eyes, his mechanics in the early days nicknamed him Chunky, but only behind his back. It was said the fortunes of Lotus could be gauged by whether his waistline was going through a thick or thin phase. Few people could have lived long at the pace Chapman set himself: racing driver, formula 1 designer and team manager, chairman of the Lotus car group, boat builder, aircraft pilot, and family man. He was appointed CBE in 1970 and other distinctions included RDI (1979), FRSA (1968), and a fellowship of University College, London. He married in 1954 Hazel Patricia, daughter of Victor Hayesmere Williams, a builder. They had two daughters and a son. Chapman's constitution could not stand up to the load of work and worry to which he subjected it. He died suddenly on 16 December 1982 of a heart attack, aged fifty-four, at East Carleton Manor, East Carleton, Norwich, the neo-colonial style mansion he had&#151;of course&#151;designed himself.<br>
