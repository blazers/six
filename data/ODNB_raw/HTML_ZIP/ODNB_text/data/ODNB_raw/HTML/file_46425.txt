<span class="headword">Longstaff <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Donald]</span>,  (Mary) Jane</span>  (1855&#150;1935), <span class="occ">biologist</span>, was born on 27 August 1855 at 16 Cavendish Place, Carlisle, Cumberland, the eldest of four children of Matthewman Hodgson Donald, manufacturer, and his wife, Henrietta Maria Roper, daughter of the Hon. J. H. Roper Curzon. She was educated at a private school in London before entering Carlisle School of Art. Interested in all aspects of natural history from an early age, Jane Donald became an authority on land and freshwater mollusca, her first paper on the mollusca of Cumberland being read to the Cumberland Association for the Advancement of Science in 1881. J. G. Goodchild of the Geological Survey, himself active in the Cumberland Association, encouraged her to study fossil shells, and her notes on Carboniferous gastropods from Penton and elsewhere, published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cumberland Association</span> (1885), constituted the first of twenty papers on the neglected subject of Palaeozoic gastropods; these she expanded into a systematic revision of fossil genera and families, which she published in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span> in the years up to 1933. She joined the Geologists' Association in 1883 and received its Murchison Fund award in 1889. Though never formally connected with any museum or institute, by visiting various museums, and with the help of private means, she produced some remarkable papers, with her own illustrations, most of which were published by the Geologists' Association. She was also a good botanist and was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1906.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1906 Jane married a widower, George Blundell Longstaff (1848/9&#150;1921), himself an entomologist; they travelled abroad together, visiting north Africa and South Africa, Australia, the West Indies, and South America. George Longstaff's interest lay in butterflies; Jane always brought back recent (not fossil) shells from these regions. Her most important paper was on the non-marine mollusca of southern Sudan, in 1914. For several years she undertook breeding experiments with the large South African land snail <i>cochlitoma</i>, the results of which she published in 1921. She also provided appendices to her husband's works, notably his <span class="italic">Butterfly Hunting in many Lands</span> (1912). Jane Longstaff died at the Spa Hotel, Bath, on 19 January 1935. Her nephew inherited her collections, which he presented to the Natural History Museum.<br>
