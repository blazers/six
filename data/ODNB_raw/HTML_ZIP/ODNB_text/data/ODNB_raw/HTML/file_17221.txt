<span class="headword">Luttrell,  Henry</span>  (1653/4&#150;1717), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a son of Thomas Luttrell (<i>d</i>. 1673) of Luttrellstown, co. Dublin, and of Barbara Sedgrave, and a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17227/', "Simon Luttrell (c.1643&#150;1698)")</script>. As a young man he served in the French army, but after the accession of James II in 1685 he was commissioned as a captain in Princess Anne of Denmark's regiment of foot. In 1686 he was given command of the 4th troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, whom he led in a skirmish with Prince William's troops at Wincanton on 20 November 1688. At the revolution he went back to France, from where he sailed with the fleet that brought King James to Ireland on 12 March 1689. He represented Carlow in the Dublin parliament of May 1689 and was given a regiment of cavalry. In July 1689 he took part in the duke of Berwick's raid on Enniskillen and distinguished himself by chasing the Williamite horse back into the town. In October that year he played an important part in Patrick Sarsfield's capture of Sligo by scattering a larger force of Williamite cavalry at Ballysadare. Luttrell was made governor of the town, which he then fortified.<br>
<br>After the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) the Jacobite government moved to Limerick, and Luttrell, then a brigadier, &#145;was perpetually speaking ill of Tyrconnell&#146;, the Jacobite lord lieutenant, &#145;and inflaming everybody against him&#146; in favour of &#145;his intimate friend&#146; Sarsfield  (Fitzjames, 80). Berwick acknowledged Luttrell to have &#145;a great share of sense, a great share of address, a great share of courage, and was a good officer; capable of anything to accomplish his ends&#146;  (ibid., 97) but referred to him as &#145;a most dangerous incendiary&#146;  (ibid., 82).<br>
<br>In September 1690 Tyrconnell sailed to France. In his absence Luttrell, Sarsfield, and the other &#145;caballing gentlemen&#146;  (Gilbert, 111) forced Berwick to send a delegation to France to urge King James to replace Tyrconnell as viceroy. The two Luttrell brothers were chosen as delegates, as was Brigadier Thomas Maxwell, who had instructions from Berwick to tell James not to allow Luttrell back to Ireland. He correctly guessed Maxwell's mission and had to be restrained by his brother and the bishop of Cork from throwing him over the side of the ship. At St Germain James received both Maxwell and a desperate letter from Tyrconnell stating that he would be able to control Sarsfield so long as Luttrell was kept away, but by the time Luttrell's delegation was permitted to address James, Tyrconnell had left the country for France. Luttrell returned to Ireland after convincing James that if he were detained the Irish would take their revenge on Berwick. On 19 May 1691 he arrived in Limerick with the new French commander, St Ruth, and resumed his campaign against Tyrconnell, now also returned to Ireland.<br>
<br>At the battle of Aughrim Luttrell commanded the brigade of dragoons that formed the first line on the left wing. The battle ended in disaster for the Irish army, the remnants of which made for Limerick. The failure of his troops, and those of his immediate superior, Dominic Sheldon, to halt the Williamite advance was crucial to the latter's victory, and he was subsequently accused of cowardice or of treachery. But there was no immediate clamour against him, and he was dispatched with a cavalry force to disrupt Ginckel's siege of Galway, though held off at Kilcolgan Bridge. When Galway surrendered, he provided the escort that brought the garrison back to Limerick. During the handover the commander of the Williamite escort party asked Luttrell whether the Irish were ready to treat. He replied that &#145;such a thing might well be if General Ginckel had a sufficient power&#146;  (Gilbert, 149) to grant terms. A few days later a messenger from the English camp was caught bringing a letter to Luttrell to let him know that Ginckel did have that authority. He was arrested by Sarsfield and on Tyrconnell's orders was tried by court martial for corresponding with the enemy. His defence was that he had merely spoken to the letter's author during a ceasefire. The tribunal acquitted him by nineteen votes to five. Lord Westmeath, who watched the tribunal, wrote that &#145;it was impossible that he could be found guilty by men that had either honesty or honour&#146;  (Harris, appx 75). Nevertheless, Tyrconnell, who had cast his vote against him, kept him locked up in Limerick Castle, where he remained until after the treaty.<br>
<br>There is no other evidence or contemporary suggestion that Luttrell was a traitor to the Jacobite cause up until the treaty of Limerick (3 October 1691), but the resentment generated by his harsh treatment by his comrades drove him firmly into the arms of the Williamites. Under the terms of the treaty the Irish troops were given the choice of going to France to serve King James, of joining King William's army, or of laying down their arms. Luttrell harangued his men and, as he later claimed,<blockquote>not only did bring to his Majestie's service the Regiment of Horse he formerly had commanded, but by himself and his friends did perswade many of the Irish to do the like and prevented 8,000 of them from goeing into France to serve against his Majestie. (McNeill, 80)</blockquote>He was awarded &pound;500 per annum and succeeded to the family estates at Luttrellstown, his brother having been outlawed.<br>
<br>Luttrell travelled to the continent for each of King William's campaigns for the rest of the Nine Years' War, but, although he was chosen to command a proposed Irish brigade which was to serve in the Venetian service against the Turks, he was never given another post. In 1699 his brother's widow sued him for her jointure on Luttrellstown. He initially defended the action by having her arrested for returning from France without a licence. The case was finally decided against him in 1709.<br>
<br>Luttrell married, in 1704, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Jones of Halkyn in Flint; they had two sons. He was shot dead in his sedan chair near his Dublin house on 3 November 1717 and was buried at Luttrellstown. It was at first feared that he had been assassinated in revenge for his actions in 1691, and a &pound;1000 reward was offered to secure the murderer. It was later generally believed that the motive behind his killing had more to do with his adultery than his politics.<br>
<br>Luttrell's second son, Simon Luttrell (1713&#150;1787), was in 1768 raised to the peerage as Baron Irnham, and later as viscount (1781) and earl (1785) of Carhampton. He was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17223/', "General Henry Lawes Luttrell, second earl of Carhampton (1737&#150;1821)")</script>; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17225/', "John Luttrell-Olmius, third earl (d. 1829)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17224/', "Luttrell, James")</script>]; of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17224/', "James Luttrell (c.1751&#150;1788)")</script>; and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17228/', "Temple Simon Luttrell (1738?&#150;1803)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17223/', "Luttrell, Henry Lawes")</script>].<br>
