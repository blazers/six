<span class="headword">Croft,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1435&#150;1488), <span class="occ">customs official, shipowner, and patron of Atlantic exploration</span>, was the son of William Croft (<i>d</i>. 1439) of Croft Castle, Herefordshire, and Isabella, presumably a second wife. He was born during the 1430s, the youngest of four brothers, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47535/', "Sir Richard Croft (1429/30&#150;1509)")</script>, John, and another Richard. He was probably serving in the household of the sons of Richard, duke of York, at Ludlow in 1454. York's defeat in October 1459 probably accounts for his admission to Lincoln's Inn, in autumn 1459. The Yorkist victory of 1461 brought him, jointly with the younger Richard Croft, lands and offices in Oxfordshire and the designation &#145;king's servant&#146;. He was sheriff of Merioneth in 1464, though he claimed never to have exercised the office. An unidentified Croft was clerk in the royal signet office from November 1461 to July 1470. Thomas Croft was readmitted to Lincoln's Inn in Trinity term 1469. In April 1470 he was commissioned to seize the lands of the rebels Warwick and Clarence. The Croft brothers lay low during Henry VI's readeption, but resumed their Oxfordshire offices on Edward IV's return in 1471. In 1472 Thomas married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1500), the daughter (probably of her mother's second marriage, to John Wysham) and one of three coheiresses of Margaret Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1452&times;6), who had inherited the estate of her father, Sir John Beauchamp, of Holt, Worcestershire (<i>d</i>. 1420). The marriage was probably arranged by Sir Walter Skull, Margaret's last husband, and former guardian of the Crofts. Thomas Croft was seneschal of Llantwit, Glamorgan, in 1474, and MP for Leominster in 1478.<br>
<br>Croft became a customer of Bristol in 1472, adding responsibility for the wine customs at Exeter and Topsham in 1475. In 1482 he was accused of not rendering account for his Merioneth shrievalty of 1464 or for the commission of 1470, and of improperly engaging in trade while a customs officer. He produced a licence to trade issued in 1480 and claimed that his share in two ships in 1481 was not for commerce but was &#145;to serch and fynd a certaine Ile callid the Isle of Brasile&#146;  (Carus-Wilson, 164). This substantiates William Worcester's evidence of early Bristol involvement in exploration. Worcester records a search for the island of &#145;Brasylle&#146; to the west of Ireland in 1480  (<span class="italic">Itineraries</span>, 308&#150;9). Croft's venture of 1481 was also unsuccessful. But these voyages were part of a continuing and possibly successful Bristol enterprise. Reporting on the Cabot voyage of 1497 to a Spanish admiral, possibly Columbus, John Day mentioned the admiral's prior knowledge of the earlier discovery by Bristol men of the isle of &#145;Brasil&#146;.<br>
<br>Croft retained his offices under Richard III, but disappeared from the Bristol scene about the end of 1484. He may have joined Henry Tudor in France, perhaps handing over the customs revenues. In 1486 Henry exempted him from accounting at the exchequer for the Bristol customs, and remitted all arrears. His nephew and namesake fought for Henry at Bosworth. Croft was not reappointed customer by Henry VII, but retained estate offices and property in Oxfordshire. He was trading with Seville in 1486. By his will, made in October 1485, the bulk of his property, lands at Woodstock and South Weston in Oxfordshire, and tenements in Bristol, was left to found a chantry at Woodstock, with lodging for a priest and two poor men, worth &pound;8 9<i>s</i>. gross when it was suppressed in 1548. Croft died, leaving no children, in 1488 (his will was proved on 15 November), and was presumably buried in his foundation. His widow, Elizabeth, subsequently married Nicholas Crowmer and died, still childless, in 1500.<br>
<br>The younger Thomas Croft was a bastard of Sir Richard Croft. For his part at Bosworth, he was granted property in Hereford after the battle of Stoke (1487), and is later designated &#145;armiger&#146; and &#145;gentleman of London&#146;. His offices and property were confiscated by act of parliament in October 1491 after he allegedly committed a murder. He was dead by 1509.<br>
