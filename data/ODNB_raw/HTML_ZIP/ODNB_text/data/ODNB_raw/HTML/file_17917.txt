<span class="headword">Manby,  Aaron</span>  (1776&#150;1850), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Albrighton, Shropshire, on 15 November 1776, the second son of Aaron Manby of Kingston, Jamaica. His early years were spent working in a bank on the Isle of Wight. He married Juliana Fewster, with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17918/', "Charles Manby")</script>. His first wife died in 1806, and in 1807 he married Sarah Ann Haskins (<i>d</i>. 1826), with whom he had one daughter, Sarah Maria (<i>d</i>. 1826), and four sons, three of whom became civil engineers.<br>
<br>By 26 November 1812 Manby was in business at Tipton, south Staffordshire, as a managing partner of the Horseley Coal and Iron Company, a mixed concern operating coal mines, blast furnaces, and engineering workshops, established some forty years earlier. Under Manby, the engineering side of the Horseley business developed greatly, and in 1813 Manby was granted one of his earliest patents, for a means of casting the refuse slag from blast furnaces into bricks and blocks for building. Eight years later, in 1821, he took out a patent for a form of steam engine well suited to marine use, which he called an &#145;oscillating engine&#146;. He was not the original inventor of this form of engine as it had been proposed by William Murdock in 1785, and patented by R. Witty in 1811, but, with his son Charles, he was the first to build and operate it commercially. The same type of engine was patented by him in France in the same year; he included in the specification a claim for making ships of iron, and an improved feathering paddle wheel. By February 1822 the oscillating engine was in use in at least three wooden steamships owned by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Transports Acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;s par Eau, of 2 rue de Valois, Paris.<br>
<br>Manby's fame rests on the iron steamships he built. The first of these, the <i>Aaron Manby</i>, was some 120 feet long and 18 feet in beam. It was made at Horseley, conveyed in pieces by canal to the Surrey Canal dock, Rotherhithe, and assembled. It was completed by 30 April 1822 and tried on the Thames on 9 May. A few days later it left London with a cargo of linseed and iron castings, under the command of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19747/', "Captain Charles Napier (1786&#150;1860)")</script>, who with Manby had formed a French company, in early 1820, with the intention of establishing a line of steamers to France. On 18 May it arrived at Boulogne, after a voyage of only fifty-five hours, and went on to reach Paris on 10 June after a brief stop in Rouen. The <i>Aaron Manby</i> is widely regarded as the first iron ship ever to go to sea. It continued to ply upon the Seine for many years, and it was still running on the Loire in 1846, but was broken up in France in 1855. Another iron vessel, the <i>Commerce de Paris</i>, was also made at Horseley, between 1821 and 1823.<br>
<br>In 1822 Manby set up an engineering works at Charenton, near Paris, entrusting its management to Daniel Wilson, a chemist who was the first to patent the use of ammonia for removing sulphuretted hydrogen from gas. The Charenton establishment was of especial importance, and had great influence over the French iron and engineering industries. In 1825 a gold medal was awarded to the founders by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale, at which time upwards of five hundred workmen were employed in the works. The effect of Manby's efforts was to render France largely independent of English engine builders, who, for a time, displayed some resentment against him&#151;as was made clear in evidence given before the 1824 parliamentary select committee on artisans and machinery.<br>
<br>On 12 May 1821 Manby, in conjunction with Wilson and another partner, took out a patent in France for the manufacture and purification of gas, and for what was then called &#145;portable gas&#146;&#151;that is, compressed gas that was supplied to consumers in strong containers. In May 1822 Manby and Wilson were among the first to obtain a concession to provide gas lighting for several streets in Paris. Their company, known as the Compagnie Anglaise, survived until 1847, despite strong competition from rivals such as the Compagnie Royale. In 1826 Manby purchased the Le Creusot ironworks. These were reorganized and provided with new and improved machinery made at Charenton, and about two years afterwards the two concerns were amalgamated under the title of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme des Mines, Forges et Fonderies du Creusot et de Charenton.<br>
<br>Manby returned to England from France at some time about 1840 and went to reside at Fulham, moving afterwards to Ryde and then to Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, where he died on 1 December 1850.<br>
