<span class="headword">Strachey,  James Beaumont</span>  (1887&#150;1967), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst and translator</span>, was born on 26 September 1887 at 69 Lancaster Gate, London, the last of the thirteen children (three of whom died during infancy) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36341/', "Sir Richard Strachey (1817&#150;1908)")</script>, scientist and geographer, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52803/', "Jane Maria Strachey (1840&#150;1928)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36341/', "Strachey, Sir Richard")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11274/', "Sir John Peter Grant (1807&#150;1893)")</script> and his wife, Henrietta (<i>b</i>. 1817). Both his parents belonged to renowned upper-middle-class families whose activities during the nineteenth century were primarily geared towards the development of stable public policies in the Indian provinces.<br>
<br>Until the age of ten James was tutored in the privacy of the family home. Emotionally serene and intellectually precocious, he rapidly developed a love for literature and the arts, mainly through the influence of his mother, who was the dominant force in the house and who often organized small literary salons for her children and their friends. In 1897 he was sent to board at Hillbrow School near Rugby, where he was watched over by his elder cousin Duncan Grant, who later became the most prominent Bloomsbury painter. There James befriended Rupert Brooke, with whom he subsequently engaged in a rich and revealing correspondence. After leaving Hillbrow, Strachey attended secondary school as a day boy at St Paul's in London until autumn 1905, when he stepped into the footsteps of his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36338/', "(Giles) Lytton Strachey")</script> and entered Trinity College, Cambridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61053/', "Ralph Strachey")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67771/', "Oliver Strachey")</script> were also his brothers, and his sisters included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48519/', "Philippa Strachey")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64780/', "Dorothea Bussy")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48467/', "(Joan) Pernel Strachey")</script>. Ray Costelloe [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38017/', "Strachey, Rachel Pearsall Conn")</script>] married his brother Oliver.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, James was soon adopted into the ranks of the Conversazione Society, a secret undergraduate fraternity which was commonly referred to as the Apostles and which, apart from Lytton, also counted Leonard Woolf and John Maynard Keynes among its members. As a freshman Strachey was reunited with Rupert Brooke, for whom he developed a profound attraction, which remained unconsummated, if not unanswered.<br>
<br>Owing to persistent procrastination and a lingering indecisiveness about his future career Strachey graduated from Cambridge with an ordinary degree in 1909, and took up a position as assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, the journal edited by his cousin John St Loe Strachey. While reviewing the activities of the Society for Psychical Research, James came across <span class="italic">The Future of Science</span>, a posthumously published book by F. W. H. Myers, one of the society's earliest members, in which reference was made to the works of Sigmund Freud. Intrigued by the psychological acumen of Freud's theories Strachey started exploring the field of psychoanalysis, an investigation which would eventually prompt him to start an analysis with the master himself.<br>
<br>Shortly after Rupert Brooke's premature death in 1915 James became simultaneously attracted to Noel Olivier&#151;the youngest daughter of Lord Sydney Olivier of Ramsden, a founding member of the Fabian socialists&#151;and Alix Sargant-Florence [<a name="cosubject_69424"></a><span class="headword">Alix Strachey</span>  (1892&#150;1973)<span class="occ"></span>], born in Nutley, New Jersey, USA, on 4 June 1892. She was the daughter of the British artist Mary Sargant-Florence (1857&#150;1954) and the American musician Henry Smythe Florence (1864&#150;1892), who died in a swimming accident six weeks after his daughter's birth. Her brother was the economist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50945/', "Philip Sargant Florence")</script>. After preparatory school Alix attended Bedales School before spending a year (1910) at the Slade School of Fine Art. In 1911 she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read modern languages. After returning to London from St Petersburg in January 1915 Alix lived with her brother in his flat in Bloomsbury. Here she attended the weekly Bloomsbury salons at which James Strachey was also present. At the time James looked frail and fragile, with a pale complexion and delicate bodily features which, were it not for his newly grown beard and studious bespectacled gaze, would have given him a strongly effeminate appearance. Noel Olivier and Alix Sargant-Florence were both recognized as stunningly beautiful women, although on different ends of the aesthetic spectrum. Whereas Noel epitomized the curvaceous elegance of the Rubenesque figure, Alix had, possibly through illness, acquired an androgynous look which, in combination with her tall and slender build, equipped her with a definite if undefinable charisma. Alix's extraordinary display of a masculine body and a feminine soul sparked off James's curiosity, and though the attraction was mutual, Alix was often more in pursuit of James than vice versa.<br>
<br>James and Alix were married in St Pancras register office on 4 June 1920, after they had already been living together for more than a year at 41 Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, London. Some six months later they settled in Vienna, where James commenced his analysis with Freud. At the time Alix had no intention to enter analysis, yet after a sudden attack of palpitations she too engaged herself in a treatment with Freud. James and Alix stayed in analysis until spring 1922, when they both returned to London and became members of the British Psychoanalytic Society.<br>
<br>During the first weeks of their analysis Freud asked James and Alix to translate some of his recent works into English, a request which signalled the beginning of one of the most heroic undertakings in the history of psychoanalysis. Indeed, while James started his own psychoanalytic practice&#151;he was the training analyst of D. W. Winnicott&#151;and pursued his analytic training with James Glover, and Alix undertook successive analyses with Karl Abraham, Edward Glover, and Sylvia Payne, the couple became more and more involved in the translation of Freud's <i>&#339;uvre</i>. From 1927 until 1950 James translated twenty-six of Freud's essays in close collaboration with Alix, who also published translations of works by Karl Abraham, Melanie Klein, and Otto Fenichel. Considering the amount of time and effort they put into the Freud translations it probably does not come as a surprise that the Stracheys' own original output remained fairly small. Throughout his life James published no more than four essays, the most influential being &#145;The nature of the therapeutic action of psychoanalysis&#146; (1934), in which he advanced the notion of &#145;mutative interpretation&#146;. Apart from a handful of concise articles Alix published <span class="italic">A New German&#150;English Psycho-Analytical Vocabulary</span> (1943), a monograph on war (<span class="italic">The Unconscious Motives of War: a Psycho-Analytical Contribution</span>, 1957), and an extended essay on national identity (&#145;Psychological problems of nationhood&#146;, 1960).<br>
<br>After the Second World War, James's acclaimed work of translation and annotation developed into the herculean project of the <span class="italic">Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</span> in twenty-four volumes, the first instalments of which were released in 1953 and the last of which, apart from the index, was published in autumn 1966, shortly before James's death. For almost twenty years James and Alix committed themselves wholeheartedly to their task, rendering Freud's words into a unified, scientific vocabulary. As James grew older and immersed himself more in the meanderings of Freud's text, he became &#145;an almost exact replica&#146;  (Holroyd, 12) of the master, sporting a short white beard and round, dark-rimmed spectacles. In recognition for his meticulous, scholarly labour of love he was awarded the Schlegel&#150;Tieck prize for translation in 1966. James Strachey died in Wycombe General Hospital, High Wycombe, on 25 April 1967 after suffering a heart attack. Alix Strachey died at the couple's home, Lord's Wood, Marlow Common, Great Marlow, on 28 April 1973.<br>
<br>Despite the fact that the <span class="italic">Standard Edition</span> remains a prime source of reference for numerous Freud researchers all over the world, owing to the translation's consistency and its invaluable critical apparatus, many criticisms have been levelled at its terminology and the purportedly dehumanizing tendencies of Strachey's scholarship. One of the principal stumbling blocks for many authors has been Strachey's decision to render the common German words of <i>Ich</i>, <i>Es</i>, and <i>&Uuml;ber-Ich</i>, which Freud used to designate the three instances of his so-called second topography, with the Latin terms &#145;Ego&#146;, &#145;Id&#146;, and &#145;Superego&#146;, instead of adopting the more common-sense option of &#145;I&#146;, &#145;It&#146;, and &#145;Above-I&#146;. It remains to be seen whether the new complete English translation of Freud's works, which was started in 2002 under the general editorship of Adam Phillips, will be able to overcome these problems, while maintaining coherence and consistency, and thus replace the <span class="italic">Standard Edition</span> as the Freud translation of preference within the Anglo-American world and beyond.<br>
