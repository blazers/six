<span class="headword">Finch,  Edward</span>  (1756&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 26 April 1756, the fifth son of Heneage Finch, third earl of Aylesford (<i>bap</i>. 1715, <i>d</i>. 1777), politician, and Lady Charlotte Seymour (1730&#150;1805), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School as a queen's scholar and entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1773, proceeding BA (1777). He entered the army as a cornet in the 11th dragoons on 27 December 1778, exchanged into the 20th light dragoons, and on 7 October 1779 was promoted lieutenant into the 87th regiment. He accompanied this regiment to the West Indies in January 1780, and served there and in America until he was promoted lieutenant and captain into the 2nd or Coldstream Guards on 5 February 1783. On 11 May 1789 he was elected MP for Cambridge, in which capacity he supported first Pitt's and then Lord Liverpool's ministries. On 3 October 1792 he was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel. In the following year he accompanied the brigade of guards to Flanders under General Gerard Lake, and served throughout the campaigns in the Netherlands under the duke of York with great credit. He was present at the actions of Caesar's Camp and Famars, in the famous engagement of Lincelles, and at the battles of Hondschoten, Lannoy, Turcoing, and round Tournai. He remained with his corps until the withdrawal of the British troops from the continent in April 1795.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1796 Finch was promoted colonel and nominated to command the light companies of the guards in Sir Eyre Coote's expedition to cut the sluices at Ostend, but was prevented from going by an accidental injury he received the day before the expedition sailed. He was present with the guards in the suppression of the Irish rising of 1798, and in 1799 commanded the 1st battalion of the Coldstreams in the expedition to The Helder and at the battles of Bergen. In the following year Finch was appointed to the command of the brigade of cavalry, consisting of the 12th and 26th light dragoons, which accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby's army to Egypt. His regiments hardly came into action at all in the famous battles of March 1801, for the ground was not well adapted for cavalry, and he covered only the siege operations against Alexandria. He received the thanks of parliament with the other generals, and on 1 January 1801 he was promoted major-general.<br>
<br>In 1803 Finch took command of the 1st brigade of guards, then stationed at Chelmsford, consisting of the 1st battalion of the Coldstreams and the 1st battalion 3rd guards, and commanded that brigade in the expedition to Denmark in 1809, and at the siege of Copenhagen. In 1802 he had been appointed a groom of the bedchamber to George III. On 25 April 1808 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and on 3 August 1808 was appointed colonel of the 54th regiment, transferring to the colonelcy of the 22nd foot on 18 September 1809. On 12 August 1819 he was promoted general. His seniority to Lord Wellington prevented him from being employed in the Peninsula, and he did not see service after 1809. He continued to sit in the House of Commons for Cambridge, through the influence of his cousin the duke of Rutland, until December 1819, when he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. Throughout the thirty years of his parliamentary career his seat was only once contested, in 1818. After 1819, Finch entirely retired from public life; he died, unmarried, on 27 October 1843, aged eighty-seven, being at the time of his death the sixth general in order of seniority in the British army.<br>
