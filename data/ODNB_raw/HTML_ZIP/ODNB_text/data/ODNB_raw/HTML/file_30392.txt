<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Allenby,  Edmund Henry Hynman</span>, first Viscount Allenby of Megiddo  (1861&#150;1936), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 23 April 1861, St George's day, on the estate of his mother's family at Brackenhurst Hall, near Southwell, Nottinghamshire, the second child and eldest son of six children (three boys, three girls) of Hynman Allenby (<i>c</i>.1822&#150;1878), a country gentleman, and his wife, Catherine Anne (1829&times;31&#150;1922), daughter of the Revd Thomas Coats Cane of Nottinghamshire. Married in 1859, Allenby's parents, after the death of Hynman Allenby's father in 1861, established the family home at Felixstowe House, Felixstowe, Suffolk (subsequently demolished); they also bought an estate in Norfolk of some 2000 acres. Brought up the son of a country squire in the countryside, away from the cities, Allenby loved nature and developed a keen knowledge of flora and fauna, a passion that would remain with him all his life. In 1935, aged seventy-four, he went to wildest Patagonia in Argentina on a final fishing trip to see if the salmon really were as big as in his beloved River Tay.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Allenby's family background and early years did not suggest a military career. After being tutored at home by a governess Allenby went in 1871 to Ashbocking vicarage to be educated by the Revd Maurice Cowell. He then went in 1875 to Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, a former training school for the East India Company resurrected as a public school in 1862. While Allenby showed no remarkable aptitude in schoolwork or sport, his schooling in the classrooms and on the playing fields of Haileybury left its imprint. Rather than intelligence, the public schools at this time emphasized courage, duty, fortitude, integrity, selflessness, self-control, and a &#145;manly&#146; belief in the virtues of the Christian faith as the vital attributes for &#145;character&#146; and for a successful career in positions of authority  (James, 6). Considering Haileybury's connections with India, Allenby decided in 1878 on a career in the Indian Civil Service, and he went to several &#145;crammer&#146; schools in London to prepare for the entrance exams. These he failed, twice. Only after this setback did he choose a career in the army. As he later recounted in a public speech, he went into the army in 1881 &#145;because he was too big a fool for anything else&#146;  (Savage, 24).<br>
<br>Having passed out of Sandhurst in December 1881, Allenby was gazetted to the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons, a not particularly fashionable cavalry regiment, on 10 May 1882. It is unclear why Allenby chose the mounted arm, but it was as a cavalryman that he made his reputation. Military life suited Allenby. While not an automaton, he was loyal, accepted orders without question, and enjoyed outdoor physical activity. When Allenby joined the army, it was beginning a period of transition as the old army gradually reformed to meet the challenges of modern, industrialized warfare. It was, however, in old-style colonial soldiering in southern Africa that Allenby served his apprenticeship as a subaltern. He joined his regiment in South Africa in 1882 before embarking in 1884 on an expedition to eject Boer lodgements in Bechuanaland (now Botswana). In 1886 Allenby returned home for a two-year stint at the cavalry depot at Canterbury and two seasons' fox-hunting. He then returned to South Africa a captain, accompanied by some hounds, joined his regiment, now on active duty in Zululand, and was promoted adjutant. With this appointment there emerged a serious application to soldiering that replaced Allenby's previously good-natured insouciance. While he had seen no actual fighting in southern Africa, he learned much of the basic fieldcraft that he would need in later wars. In this period Allenby also became something of a martinet; when he assumed senior command his withering temper, imposing physical presence (matched by a voracious appetite), and obsession with discipline and orders earned him the nickname &#145;the Bull&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1890, when the 6th dragoons returned home for garrison duties, Allenby settled into a rhythm of hunting, sport, socializing, and military duties. He also married: in 1895 he had met Adelaide Mabel Chapman (<i>c</i>.1868&#150;1942), daughter of Horace Edward Chapman, and on 30 December 1896 the two were married at the bride's home at Donhead House, Salisbury, Wiltshire. Allenby's wife shared his love of the country and the marriage was intensely happy, lasting until his death in 1936. Adelaide Mabel, along with Allenby's mother, to whom he wrote regularly until her death in 1922, provided a solid foundation on which Allenby built his reputation as a soldier. In 1898 Adelaide Mabel gave birth to a son, Michael, the Allenbys' much loved only child. Michael's death on the western front in July 1917 shattered the typically marmoreal Allenby, who broke down and, inconsolable, wept in front of one of his divisional commanders (General Sir John Shea, recording, IWM SA, typescript, 5.41&#150;2).<br>
<br>Allenby's reticence masked considerable ambition and drive, and in 1896 he passed by competition into the Staff College at Camberley, a notable achievement at a time when few cavalrymen entered Staff College except by nomination. Allenby's class included another future field marshal, Douglas Haig. The cerebral James Edmonds, another entrant of 1896, recalled that Allenby was &#145;curiously taciturn&#146; at Staff College and &#145;rather out of his depth in the very medium company of 1896&#150;7&#146;  (Gardner, 23). While Allenby was neither strikingly intellectual nor garrulous, he was more popular than Haig, over whom fellow officers elected him to the prestigious position of master of the drag hounds for the 1896&#150;7 season. A solid rather than outstanding student at Staff College, Allenby showed himself to be tolerant and flexible and, while not a big debater, capable of interesting conversations on a range of topics. His willingness to listen and consider new ideas would prove to be assets as he rose to the pinnacle of his profession.<br>
<br>Promoted major in 1897, Allenby was made adjutant (equivalent to a brigade major) to the 3rd cavalry brigade in 1898. The next year saw the outbreak of the South African War (1899&#150;1902), and in October the Inniskillings shipped out for service in South Africa against the Boers. This was Allenby's first war. Given temporary command of the Inniskillings in 1900, he emerged at the war's end in 1902 with much credit, a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy, and useful contacts; and in 1902 he was created CB in recognition of his service. Allenby started the war as an unknown major; he ended it with a reputation as a competent, reliable leader, and as someone marked out for possible promotion. While not a brilliant commander, Allenby had suffered no major reverses and, physically tough, had proved himself in the field on lengthy, exacting operations during which British columns swept the veldt for Boer commandos. Allenby also worked well with an attached Australian cavalry regiment, the New South Wales lancers, a portent of future operations during the First World War, when he commanded Australian mounted troops in Palestine. After the South African War, Allenby became a full colonel and in 1905 was made a brigadier-general and given command of the 4th cavalry brigade. In 1909 he rose to the rank of major-general before, the following year, becoming inspector-general of cavalry, a post he held until the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>As Allenby coped with the pressures of senior command before and during the First World War, he became increasingly irascible, obsessive with discipline, and bad-tempered towards subordinates. Hubert Gough, his chief staff officer when inspector-general of cavalry, recalled that Allenby had a &#145;great regard for regulations and all sort of detail&#146; and that if Allenby, when inspecting a unit, saw any neglect of detail or orders he was liable to explode  (Gardner, 62). Cavalrymen who neglected to do up their chinstraps felt the full weight of Allenby's concern with obeying all orders to the letter. During one inspection an officer remarked &#145;Very good, Sir&#146;, to which Allenby barked back, &#145;I want none of your bloody approbation&#146;  (James, 81). As one of his officers recalled, while Allenby had been an easy-going young officer and a good-humoured squadron leader, he was a strict colonel, an irascible brigadier, and an explosive general  (Wavell, <span class="italic">Study in Greatness</span>, 1.114). This bad temper got worse once war broke out in 1914. One senior western front commander willing to withstand one of Allenby's tirades earned himself the sobriquet &#145;toreador&#146;, before being dismissed  (James, 84). Allenby's wicked temper was a result of his having to cope with the strains of command. He was also capable of great kindness, did not bear grudges, and was always willing to listen to his officers as long as they could provide convincing evidence for their arguments.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarFrance"></a>The First World War: France</h2>Allenby assumed command of the cavalry division on the outbreak of war in August 1914. However, the relationship with his commander, Haig, was far from ideal. While there was goodwill between the two men, both were uncommunicative in each other's company. This made discussions of strategy awkward. Allenby fumbled for words while Haig rambled through a series of unfinished sentences.<br>
<br>While questions were raised over his handling of the cavalry during the retreat from Mons, Allenby's defence of the Messines&#150;Wytschaete ridge during the first battle of Ypres (October&#150;November 1914), with what was now the cavalry corps of two divisions, showed him at his dogged best: unflappable, reliable, and determined to stick to his orders and hold his ground at all cost against overwhelming odds. In May 1915 Allenby took over 5th corps during the second battle of Ypres before taking charge of the Third Army in October 1915 with the temporary rank of general. He was made a KCB in the same year (a GCMG would follow in 1917, a GCB in 1918, and a GCVO in 1934). In the trying circumstances of the western front, unable to institute manoeuvre warfare, Allenby proved himself a competent rather than inspiring general.<br>
<br>Allenby's opportunity to prove himself came in April 1917 when his Third Army attacked at Arras. In the planning stages of the battle he reduced the preparatory bombardment to under 48 hours to give his assault troops the element of surprise. But Haig vetoed Allenby's &#145;hurricane&#146; bombardment in favour of a longer five-day artillery barrage and, under pressure, Allenby acquiesced in the change of plan. While disadvantaged operationally, Allenby instituted a number of measures, such as using the sewers and cellars of Arras as a way of getting troops secretly to the jumping-off points, to achieve tactical surprise. The result was an impressive initial gain of almost 4 miles when the battle opened on 9 April 1917. Thereafter the fighting turned into a series of bitter and costly attritional battles as the Third Army engaged the German defence-in-depth system. Allenby's inability to change Haig's mind once the battle of Arras bogged down, and his willingness faithfully to carry out orders that he must have known would achieve little except cause heavy casualties, show some of his shortcomings. As was noted in his obituary: &#145;Allenby conscientiously, if clumsily, carried out an operation which, it was recognized, could hardly be decisive, and had been continued mainly with a view to giving the French time in which to recover&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18). The assessment of Gough, commander of the Fifth Army, was that while Allenby's behaviour was &#145;very just&#146; he also had &#145;no ideas and when in France would apply orders rigidly without reasoning&#146;  (King's Lond., Liddell Hart MSS, talk with Lloyd George and Gough, 28 Nov 1935, 11/1935/107).<br>
<br>Allenby came unstuck after Arras and, looking for a new commander for Palestine, the British leader, David Lloyd George, dispatched him to the Middle East to command the British-led Egyptian expeditionary force (EEF). While Allenby was desolate at being moved to Palestine, independent command in a peripheral war theatre away from the intrigues of the western front made his name and in October 1919 secured him a field marshal's baton, a viscountcy, and an award from parliament of &pound;50,000.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarPalestine"></a>The First World War: Palestine</h2>When Allenby arrived in Egypt on 27 June 1917 (he assumed command the following day), EEF morale had collapsed. Under the uninspiring leadership of General Archibald Murray the force had been defeated twice at the town of Gaza in spring 1917. Allenby set about rebuilding the EEF into a force capable of taking the offensive. He moved his headquarters to Khan Yunis, just behind the front line at Gaza, and embarked on a series of tours of EEF front-line troops. The tough Australian and New Zealand mounted troops that formed a mobile core to the EEF soon noticed the change in atmosphere. One Australian light horseman remembered how under Murray he and his comrades were &#145;fed up&#151;we considered we hadn't had the leadership we were due for and it seemed to be one blunder after another. Then the arrival of Allenby, morale rose&#146;  (IWM SA, Trooper Pollock recording, 4200). Allenby's impact resonated through the EEF. Richard Meinertzhagen, an EEF staff officer, recorded how the force was finally awakening from its &#145;lethargic sleep under Murray&#146;  (Meinertzhagen diaries, 15 July 1917), while Ronald Storrs, a future military governor of Jerusalem, noted that under Allenby the EEF was advancing with &#145;exhilaration into new hope&#146;  (Storrs, 270). With the weight of the western front lifted from his shoulders, Allenby rose to meet the challenges of his new post. Unlike Murray, he was no office general and, physically fit, was willing and able to travel over bumpy tracks in the stifling heat to visit units in the desert. Allenby's experience in field command of everything from a troop in southern Africa in the 1880s to an army in France gave him the standing to talk to rankers and lift their spirits. His sheer presence helped lift morale, and, like General Bernard Montgomery before the battle of Alamein in 1942, show his men that the impending battle was winnable  (Hughes, 14&#150;17).<br>
<br>While Allenby's personality remained fundamentally unchanged  (Falls, <span class="italic">DNB</span>), the different circumstances in Palestine drew out his best qualities and emphasized a more sympathetic and thoughtful side. The Australian official historian Henry Gullett remembered Allenby visiting an Australian unit out in the desert where the canteen had been open for some time before he arrived, with the result that many of the men were drunk. The drunks struck matches on Allenby's car, &#145;almost leaned on him. The tighter they were the closer they wished to get to him&#146;  (Gullett papers, AWM40/69, &#145;Murray&#146;). Allenby's reaction to this incident was afterwards to write an appreciative note to the unit commander. Major-General George de Symons Barrow, one of Allenby's divisional commanders, compared Allenby favourably to Haig, writing about how Allenby was happy to be contradicted as long as this was backed up by a cogent argument  (G. de S. Barrow, <span class="italic">Fire of Life</span>, 1942, 46). Storrs recalled that being told off by Allenby was like being blown from the muzzle of a gun, but when the victim regained the ground Allenby bore him no malice  (Storrs, 270). Allenby's mix of martinet and motivation infused new life into the EEF, transforming it into a fighting force. His first action opened in October 1917 with the third battle of Gaza, the objective being to capture Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Prior to third Gaza, artillery, aeroplanes, men, and equipment poured into Egypt, turning the EEF into a well-equipped force of ten divisions&#151;seven infantry and three cavalry. On 12 August 1917 Allenby organized these units into three corps: the 20th and 21st infantry corps and the desert mounted corps. These reinforcements were vital for the offensive to break the Turkish lines that stretched in a ragged line from Gaza to Beersheba. For the third battle of Gaza, Allenby adopted a plan worked out by Murray's staff before his arrival. This plan involved shifting the emphasis of attack away from Gaza, with two of his three mounted divisions, plus four of the infantry divisions available, attacking the weaker eastern extremity of the Turkish lines at Beersheba, before rolling up the enemy defences from the east. The plan worked. Australian light horse troops charged in and took Beersheba on 31 October and moved west to join up with the force at Gaza prior to the push on Jerusalem. The city was finally captured on 9 December 1917. The surrender was taken by two &#145;cockney&#146; privates from the 60th (London) division out looking for water; they were accosted by the mayor of Jerusalem bearing the keys to the city, and looking for someone to surrender to  (James, 140).<br>
<br>Considering the weak nature of the Turkish defences at Gaza, it has been suggested  (Hughes, 43&#150;59) that Allenby would have done better to concentrate his augmented force, which included a substantial pool of artillery, for an assault on Gaza town rather than on Beersheba. This would have led to a more comprehensive victory. As it was, the Turks were allowed the space to retire in good order to a new defensive line across central Palestine just north of Jerusalem from which they were not dislodged until the war's end. This does not, however, diminish Allenby's success at third Gaza: he reversed the two earlier defeats at Gaza and captured the historic city of Jerusalem. While he was perhaps too cautious and methodical at third Gaza, he was also under intense pressure to invade Palestine and take Jerusalem, especially after his supposed failure at Arras. Having examined the plan offered to him on his arrival in Egypt, he felt that this offered the best likelihood of fulfilling the wishes of his political superiors in the time allotted for the task. He was also hampered by having to conduct operations within the context of a protracted struggle between Lloyd George and elements of the military, notably General William Robertson, over war strategy and the question of whether &#145;side-shows&#146; such as Palestine were worthy of support. Caught in the middle of this acrimonious debate, Allenby had to tread carefully and please both sides.<br>
<br>With the capture of Jerusalem, Allenby was portrayed as a modern-day Richard Lionheart  (<span class="italic">Punch</span>, 19 Dec 1917) finally recapturing the holy city lost to the Muslims in 1187. For Britain the fall of Jerusalem was a notable propaganda coup at a very difficult moment in the war; for Lloyd George it was the Christmas present for the nation that he had demanded of Allenby before he left for Palestine. Allenby's entry into the city on 11 December was a carefully stage-managed show. He entered on foot through the Jaffa Gate, having dismounted outside the walls, in a gesture that compared favourably to the German Kaiser's entry on horseback in 1898, read out a proclamation of martial law, and then left, again on foot.<br>
<br>After third Gaza the impending German (Ludendorff) offensives on the western front hampered Allenby's plans, as the EEF was a potential reserve force for France. When the offensives broke in March 1918 he lost the bulk of his infantry and some of his cavalry. They were replaced by untrained Indian troops who needed time to be absorbed into the EEF. This restricted Allenby's plans for 1918. From March to May 1918 he launched two &#145;raids&#146;&#151;the official nomenclature for multi-divisional attacks&#151;across the River Jordan towards Amman. Their objectives were unclear and resulted in two comprehensive defeats by Turkish forces  (Hughes, 71&#150;88). These defeats shocked Allenby  (Allenby MSS, 6/IX&#150;X/40&#150;41) and for a circumspect commander such as Allenby suggest a loss of grip on operations.<br>
<br>Allenby's finest hour, and the crowning triumph of the Palestine campaign, came with his final offensive against the Turkish armies in Palestine, launched on 19 September 1918 and ending with the armistice signed at Mudros on 30 October 1918. This final battle was given the name Megiddo as Allenby's forces pushed by the ancient mound of Megiddo, the supposed site of the final battle (or Armageddon) revealed in the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> (16: 16). Megiddo was a cavalry triumph: once artillery and infantry had punched a hole in the Turkish lines, Allenby's British, Indian, Australian, and New Zealand cavalry swept out behind Turkish lines and advanced all the way to Aleppo in northern Syria. Having said this, the poor condition of the Turkish forces in Palestine must be allowed for in assessing Allenby's success at Megiddo. Debilitated by a lack of men and equipment, they were in a much weakened state by September 1918. The Turkish high command from late 1917 had starved the Palestine front of <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>, preferring to concentrate resources on a push in the Caucasus. By the battle of Megiddo the Turks in Palestine could do little to resist when overwhelmed by Allenby's superior forces. The scale of the triumph surprised Allenby, who was planning a methodical push into Palestine and Syria  (Hughes, 97). While cavalry was used extensively in the Russian civil war, and even the Second World War, the battle of Megiddo marked the swansong of cavalry, and the end of the era of the horse as a decisive weapon of war.<br>
<br>Throughout the campaign Allenby liaised with Hashemite Arab forces allied to Britain. Directed by Colonel T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), the Arabs were deployed on Allenby's right flank. While Allenby approved Lawrence's operations, the considerable post-war interest in the enigmatic Lawrence should not detract from Allenby's concentration on the main push by the EEF west of the River Jordan. Allenby took little account of the Arab force militarily, although he accommodated the imperial need to promote the Hashemites by ordering his troops to allow the Arabs into Damascus &#145;first&#146;, even though EEF cavalry clearly entered the city on 30 September&#150;1 October 1918 before Arab forces arrived.<h2>
<a name="Postwar"></a>Post-war</h2>The war's end presented Allenby with new challenges. He was the military commander of a swath of territory stretching from the Sudan to northern Syria before, in March 1919, becoming special high commissioner for Egypt, a post that was confirmed in October 1919 when he returned to London to be raised to the peerage, as first Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and Felixstowe, and promoted field marshal. Allenby was an able colonial administrator at a difficult time for the British empire. In 1919 Egypt rose in revolt and he had to deploy large numbers of troops to suppress the uprising with considerable force. Simultaneously his troops were clamouring to be demobilized, to the extent that some units effectively mutinied and refused to carry out orders  (Hughes, 141&#150;3). Meanwhile Australian and New Zealand troops went on the rampage through the Palestinian village of Surafend, beating to death some forty Arab villagers. On another occasion a paraded Australian unit shouted Allenby &#145;out&#146; in an orchestrated example of disobedience  (A. F. Nayton, letter, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 May 1964). While he was furious at these acts of indiscipline, there was little Allenby could do now that the war was over. Worried by the threat of revolt, he urged the negotiators at the Paris peace conference to bear in mind the consequences of their decisions for the Middle East. Pressures within Egypt after the 1919 revolt for independence were a perennial problem for Allenby, temporarily solved by the granting of some self-rule in 1922. The end of his tenure in Egypt was marred by the assassination of Sir Lee Stack, the governor-general of Sudan, in 1924. He never resolved the dilemma of Egypt's status, an issue that rumbled on into the 1930s and beyond. It was, therefore, with some relief that in June 1925 Allenby left the official residency in Cairo with his wife and returned to Britain and retirement after a long period of service as a soldier and administrator.<br>
<br>While the king gave the Allenbys rent-free use of Deal Castle, by 1928 they had purchased a more manageable town house at 24 Wetherby Gardens, London, on the fringes of Kensington. Allenby's chief public work was as president of the British National Cadet Force. Otherwise he used the time afforded by his retirement to indulge in bird-watching and travelling. Indeed it was after a trip to buy material for the aviary in his garden that Allenby died at home of a burst blood vessel in his brain on 14 May 1936. He was cremated and buried in St George's chapel in Westminster Abbey on 19 May.<br>
