<span class="headword">Timbrell,  Henry</span>  (1806&#150;1849), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of James Timbrell, clerk of the ordnance, and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shelling. He began his studies about 1823 under the Irish sculptor John Smyth (Smith) and in 1825 entered the schools of the Royal Dublin Society, where he was awarded several prizes. Between 1827 and 1829 he also exhibited six works and won various prizes at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin, showing in 1827 a figure of a Grecian warrior and in 1828 a bust of his master, John Smyth. In 1830 he went to London and worked in the studio of William Behnes, and as a pupil of Edward Hodges Baily, who continued to employ him occasionally for several years. He was at the same time a student at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1833 he exhibited <span class="italic">Phaeton</span>, in 1834 the bas-relief <span class="italic">Satan in Search of the Earth</span> (both of which he also exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1834 and 1835), and in 1835 <span class="italic">Sorrow</span>, a monumental group. On 10 December 1835 he gained the gold medal for his group, <span class="italic">Mezentius Tying the Living to the Dead</span>, which was exhibited in 1836. On 3 February 1838 he married Susan Flather in St Pancras's, London.<br>
<br>Among Timbrell's other works shown at the Royal Academy were several busts: <span class="italic">Grief</span>, a bas-relief (1839); <span class="italic">Psyche</span> (1842); <span class="italic">Hercules Throwing Lycas into the Sea</span> (1843). With the <span class="italic">Hercules</span> group he won the travelling scholarship of the Royal Academy, and went to Rome in the same year. While there he completed a bas-relief for the temple at Buckingham Palace, London, and in 1845 a life-sized group, <span class="italic">Instruction</span>, which was ruined in the wreck of the ship bringing it to England. At the time of his death he was working on statues of Richard, earl of Clare, and William, earl of Aumale, for the chamber of the House of Lords in the new houses of parliament, and another in marble of <span class="italic">The Lamp of the Ganges</span> for Queen Victoria, an engraving of which by W. Roffe appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1855. Henry Timbrell died of pleurisy in Rome on 10 April 1849. Buried in Rome, his funeral was attended by fellow sculptors John Gibson, John Hogan, and Richard James Wyatt. A later historian noted that &#145;Timbrell's early death terminated a career of much promise&#146;  (Strickland, 2.448).<br>
<br>Timbrell's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_27459"></a><span class="headword">James Christopher Timbrell</span>  (1810&#150;1850), <span class="occ">painter and sculptor</span>, was born in Dublin. In 1825 he entered the Royal Dublin Society's Schools, and in 1827 sent a landscape to the Royal Hibernian Academy exhibition. In 1829 he presented one of his lithographs, <span class="italic">The Scotch Fisher</span>, to the Dublin Society. He went to London in 1830 and exhibited three paintings of figurative subjects at the Royal Academy and five at the British Institution between 1830 and 1848, including <span class="italic">Summer</span> and <span class="italic">The Fisherman's Return</span>. He contributed eight illustrations to <span class="italic">Ireland: its Scenery and Character</span> (3 vols., 1841&#150;3) by Mr and Mrs Samuel Carter Hall. He died in Portsmouth on 5 January 1850.<br>
