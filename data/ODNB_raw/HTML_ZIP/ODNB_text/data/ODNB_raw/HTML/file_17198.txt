<span class="headword">Luny,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1837), <span class="occ">marine painter</span>, son of Thomas Luny and his wife, Elizabeth Wallace, was probably born in Cornwall, being baptized at St Ewe near Mevagissey on 20 May 1759. His mother had a son from a previous marriage, James Wallace (1754&#150;1832), a Royal Navy captain who fought at Copenhagen with Nelson in 1801. By 1773 Luny was apprenticed to the marine painter Francis Holman from whose address, Johnson Street, St George's, London, he first exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1777 and 1778. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780 from nearby Anchor and Hope Street, with Ratcliffe Highway being his academy exhibiting address from 1782 to 1790. In 1783 his picture <span class="italic">Battle of the Dogger Bank</span> (1781) was his only appearance at the Free Society of Artists, submitted from the address of Thomas Merle, a frame maker in Leadenhall Street, near East India House, who appears to have been an outlet for many of Luny's ship portraits of East Indiamen and similar compositions. Luny exhibited annually at the Royal Academy until 1793, then again in 1802, when he showed <span class="italic">Battle of the Nile</span> (1798).<br>
<br>A belief that Luny joined the navy as a purser in 1793 and retired on a pension when incapacitated is now discounted, despite the absence of exhibited works between then and 1802. Many of his subjects suggest that he travelled, but there is no direct evidence of this save for a visit to Paris in 1777. In 1791 he bought a property at 16 Mark Lane, between Leadenhall Street and the Thames, and by January 1795 was earning enough to begin regular investment in interest-bearing government stocks. In mid-1807 he moved to Teignmouth, a fashionable watering place on the Devon coast, probably for health reasons. In 1808&#150;9 he built a home there in Teign Street, later called Luny House. From February 1807 to December 1835 he kept a list of paintings, purchasers, and prices: it includes over 2200 works, but there must have been many more. The earliest paintings listed include views of London and Blackfriars bridges, but Teignmouth features from June 1807. Thereafter picturesque local coastal views, shipping scenes, and naval events were his stock-in-trade, most selling for under &pound;5, some at &pound;10, and a few up to &pound;25. Again he did well: his link with Merle lasted to 1817 and he established others with frame-maker&#150;dealers in Bristol and Plymouth as well as finding many local clients. These included Captain George Tobin, an amateur artist who retired to Teignmouth in 1814 and with whom his supposed naval career was previously linked.<br>
<br>Luny was able to paint occasional large pictures (up to 5 ft &times; 8 ft) as late as about 1821 but by the mid-1820s he was confined to a wheelchair by some form of arthritis, which deprived him of the use of his hands and forced him to work with his brush held between both fists or strapped to his wrist. At their best Luny's naval battles, shipping, and wreck scenes are dramatic, strongly drawn, and colourful, with many of the small coastal scenes he did around Teignmouth having a picturesque, atmospheric charm. Unsurprisingly, given his disability, the drawing of some later work is weak and his original bright colour also became increasingly muted. He exhibited a pair, of the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar, at the British Institution in 1825. His last pictures were shown at the Royal Academy in 1837, just before 130 were exhibited for sale in Old Bond Street, when a report states he had given up painting about two years before (<span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>, 24 June 1837), no doubt because of the arthritis which had then crippled him. The last known date on a painting is in fact 1836. He also painted in watercolour and a number of his pictures, both naval and topographical, were engraved.<br>
<br>Luny was described by a friend of the late 1820s as probably of medium height, had he been able to stand, and &#145;as a man of broad and well-nurtured frame, of fair and somewhat florid complexion; not easily drawn into conversation, but of kindly nature and pleasant in his manner with children&#146;  (Dymond, 443). He died, unmarried, on 30 September 1837, at his home in Teignmouth, and was buried in West Teignmouth churchyard. He left estate of nearly &pound;14,000, including Luny House, other local property, and his Mark Lane house, which he had retained. Most went to his niece, Mrs Elizabeth Haswell (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wallace), who was his nearest surviving relative. At the end of his life he is said to have engaged Moses Gompertz (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1893), better known as a diorama painter, as an assistant and after his death either Gompertz or one of his niece's six sons, or both, spent some months completing a large number of unfinished works for sale. This and the fact that a talented amateur pupil, Captain Hulme of Exeter, is said to have &#145;caught his style&#146;  (Dymond, 447) can produce attribution problems. The National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, has forty oils, mostly of naval scenes, and sketchbooks. The Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, also has a collection and while many museums also hold examples of his work, most are probably still in private hands given their regular appearance on the market. Two large pictures of the bombardment of Algiers (1816), which Luny painted in 1819 for the commander there, Admiral Lord Exmouth, remained at the latter's home, Canonteign House, until sold in 1992.<br>
