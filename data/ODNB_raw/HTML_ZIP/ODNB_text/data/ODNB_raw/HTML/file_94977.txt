<span class="headword">Sexey,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1619), <span class="occ">lawyer and benefactor</span>, was a native of Bruton in east Somerset. The William Sexey recorded as buried there on 15 January 1567 may have been his father. A reliable tradition records his origins as humble, even though his family can be traced back to at least 1429. Hugh Sexey's first recorded dealings in property were conducted in 1566, so if it is assumed that he was then at least twenty-five years old, he may have been born about 1540, a date in keeping with a contemporary report that he was of an advanced age when he died in 1619. It is probable that he was educated at Bruton's free grammar school through the patronage of Sir Maurice Berkeley, who had acquired the site and much of the land of the Augustinian abbey of Bruton in 1544.<br>
<br>The first firm evidence for Sexey's professional career dates from 1566, when he was living in Redcross Street, in London's Cripplegate suburb, and was described as an attorney. In October that year he received a twenty-one-year lease from the crown of the Devon borough of South Molton, then in a desolate condition, and undertook to rebuild and repair its ruined buildings. He subsequently became involved in negotiations over leases of crown properties in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon, both on his own account and on behalf of gentry families in those counties, including those of Berkeley of Bruton and Fitzjames of Redlynch, and he also obtained a number of lucrative offices. He became a steward of former monastic lands in Somerset and Wiltshire, bailiff and deputy auditor for the bishopric of Bath and Wells, and a collector of rents from crown lands in Somerset and bailiff of the royal woodlands there. In 1582 he was appointed deputy in the exchequer to Thomas Hanbury, one of the auditors, and in 1599 himself obtained the reversion of an auditorship there, securing the position in 1603 and retaining it for the rest of his life. His social rank in 1578 was still that of yeoman, but a year later he was described as gentleman, and by 1588 as esquire.<br>
<br>Sexey's legal practice, property dealings, and public offices enabled him to acquire great wealth, which he invested in land, principally in large estates round Bruton, but also in Gloucestershire and Middlesex. In 1583 he married Dorothy Fletcher (<i>d</i>. 1597) from Otley in Yorkshire. They had no children, and husband and wife devoted themselves to charitable undertakings, Dorothy in Otley and Hugh in Bruton, where he made generous provision for the poor. Soon after his death it was recorded that he &#145;did in his lifetime convert divers little houses in Bruton aforesaid for habitations for divers poor people and then gave them certain small weekly maintenance&#146;  (Som. ARS, DD/SE 35, DD/SE 38). Dorothy Sexey died in 1597, and on 19 December 1611 her husband married Ursula, daughter of Gawen Champernowne of Dartington, Devon. Following the death of Ursula's father, her mother, Gabrielle, had married Thomas Horner of Cloford, 7 miles north-east of Bruton, and it was there that the marriage took place. Relations between Sexey and his much younger wife quickly deteriorated, however, and in 1616 he vested the income from much of his extensive property, both around Bruton and elsewhere, in the hands of ten prominent local gentlemen&#151;led by Sir Laurence Hyde of West Hatch and including three members of the Berkeley family&#151;as feoffees for a charity to be set up following his death. Ursula was left only a life interest in the manor of Blackford, near Wedmore, a few miles north-west of Glastonbury.<br>
<br>Hugh Sexey died at his house in London on 19 August 1619, and was buried in the parish church of St Giles Cripplegate. Soon afterwards his widow married Sir Gerard Samms of Little Totham, Essex; she died in 1634. Sexey's death was followed by protracted litigation over his will. Brief, and signed only with the initials H. S. in a shaky hand, it was dated on the day of his death and proved just two days later. It left &pound;140 to his clerk Thomas Bankes and his wife Anne (a cousin of Sexey), &pound;400 to his cousin George Utley, &pound;500 to be divided among the rest of his kindred, small sums to his servants, and &#145;All the rest to my deare wife Ursula Sexey whom I make my executrix&#146;  (Som. ARS, DD/SE 38; TNA: PRO, PROB 81 Parker). The will was contested by Thomas and Anne Bankes, who had lived with Sexey and served him for many years. They alleged that Sexey had left much of his property to Anne, who was his nearest relation, but that Ursula had destroyed the original will, instead producing a new one and persuading her husband to initial it on his deathbed, not half an hour before he died. They were joined in their objections by a number of others from Bruton, also claiming both kinship with Sexey and rights in parts of his estate. Although litigation continued until 1624, their pleas were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Sexey had left no precise instructions as to the form his charity should take, and the feoffees, having inquired &#145;among his most inward and familiar Friends concerning his intentions&#146;, decided to found a hospital or almshouse in Bruton for twelve aged and impotent persons  (Som. ARS, DD/SE 38). A building was erected in the main street of Bruton, built around a quadrangle and containing rooms for the master and inmates, a hall, and an elegantly furnished chapel in which the master was to conduct divine service for the inmates twice each day. Building work was completed in 1632, whereupon a master was appointed and the first inmates, seven men and five women, were admitted. Rules for the hospital were prescribed by a deed of incorporation drawn up on 10 December 1638. Later in the seventeenth century a stone bust of Sexey, together with a coat of arms (that of the Saxey family of Bristol, with which he had no known connection), was placed over the entrance hall; they were carved by William Stanton of London. The income from Sexey's charitable endowment was such that the feoffees could also provide schooling and apprenticeships for poor boys in Bruton, and devote yet other funds &#145;to Godly and pious uses&#146;  (Som. ARS, DD/SE 38). Later they were able to extend the almshouse, establish other schools for both boys and girls in Bruton, and set up a school on the founder's estate at Blackford. The almshouse and schools serve their original purpose to the present day.<br>
