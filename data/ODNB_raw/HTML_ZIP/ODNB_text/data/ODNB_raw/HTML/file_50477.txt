<span class="headword">Shepheard,  Samuel</span>  (1816&#150;1866), <span class="occ">hotel proprietor</span>, was born on 21 January 1816 at Little Preston Manor, Preston Capes, Northamptonshire, the second son and third child of Richard Shepheard (<i>d</i>. 1820), farmer, and his wife, Jane Berwick (<i>d</i>. 1817). Both parents died before he was four, and Samuel grew up in the family of his father's sister Esther and her husband, Joseph Stanley, the licensee of The Crown inn at Leamington. Family legend held that Samuel and a cousin, John Stanley, were sent away from home after minimal schooling to gain experience as farm-hands, and that Samuel was later apprenticed three times to pastry-cooks in Leamington. Breaking his indentures for the last time, he left to go to sea, and rose to become purser on one of the Peninsular and Oriental (P. &amp; O.) Company's passenger and mail ships which plied between Bombay and Suez. Shortly after his twenty-sixth birthday, however, he was summarily put ashore at Suez, apparently following a mutiny of forecastle hands towards which he had shown himself to be sympathetic.<br>
<br>British interest in the condition of Egypt, from 1811 to 1848 the undisputed fief of the Albanian Mehmet Ali under the suzerainty of the Turkish Porte, centred on the overland route between Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez. In the late 1830s this ordeal by riverboat and camel had become the nexus between the two parts of the new, shorter sea-route from Europe to the East. Once Lieutenant Thomas Waghorn of the East India Company's fleet had established the viability of the route P. &amp; O. gained a contract for the overland postal and passenger-carrying service, and remained in charge of the transit business from 1840 until the Egyptian government took control of it in 1846. Passengers from Europe landed at Alexandria, made an eighteen-hour journey by the Mahmudiyyah Canal and the Nile to Cairo, and rested, often at the British Hotel, until ready for the desert crossing eastwards to Suez. By the 1840s, visitors to Cairo included wealthy European and American tourists intent on seeing the pyramids and the upper Nile, as well as those bound on more serious business for India and further east.<br>
<br>Shepheard was taken on as an assistant at the British Hotel, became manager in 1844, and proprietor by 1846, renaming it Shepheard's Hotel. Two years later he moved the hotel from its cramped surroundings in the streets of the Frankish quarter to a row of buildings on the edge of the Esbekier, then a large, open, tree-lined square. By 1851 the hotel had become transformed and greatly enlarged by a grant of adjacent property from Mehmet Ali's grandson and heir, Abbas Pasha. In 1850 Shepheard was also granted a contract for the Suez Hotel. Two years later the traveller C. F. Andrews in <span class="italic">Four Months' Tour in the East</span> described him as having &#145;the cuisine of all the Nile steamers&#146;, and the provisioning of the desert rest-houses established by Arthur Anderson of the P. &amp; O. Company  (Bird, 171).<br>
<br>The cosmopolitanism and importance of its clientele and the determinedly entrepreneurial spirit of its proprietor made Shepheard's Hotel a household name among sophisticated travellers during the late 1840s and 1850s. Lord Stanley, the future prime minister and earl of Derby, stayed there on his way to visit India in 1852, and Lord Elphinstone, the new governor of Bombay, in 1853. In 1858, the novelist Anthony Trollope wrote much of <span class="italic">Doctor Thorne</span> in the newly re-extended Shepheard's Hotel while negotiating a treaty with the Egyptian ruler, Sa&#145;id Pasha, about the conveyance of mails across Egypt by railway. According to Trollope, &#145;the English tongue in Egypt finds its centre in <i>Shepheard's Hotel</i>&#146;  (Bird, 160).<br>
<br>Events in the East during the 1850s brought additional profits to Shepheard as a provider of large-scale hospitality to officers and troops. On the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854 he received a government contract to ease the passage of British detachments on their way to Sevastopol. This brought him &pound;4500, part of which he obtained by pursuing defaulting officers as far as the Crimea. In 1857, by then the proprietor of the biggest hotel in the world, he was once again in demand to house and feed British soldiers before dispatching them on relays of donkeys to Suez, on their way to India to help quell the mutiny.<br>
<br>In 1859 the visit of Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred on a training cruise to Egypt brought the entire Mediterranean Fleet to anchor off Alexandria, and many more visitors to Shepheard's Hotel. The opening of the Suez Railway in 1858 had removed many of the hazards previously associated with travel in Egypt, and Shepheard's enjoyed the peak of its international fame. In January 1860, however, having long planned retirement to England for health and family reasons, Shepheard sold the hotel to M. Zeck of Alexandria for &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>In 1844 Shepheard had married a former hotel guest, Mary Rangecroft, whom he had met when she was on her way to India as a lady's companion, and who became an active partner in running the hotel. Of their two sons and six daughters, born between 1845 and 1856, four died of cholera and other illnesses at Cairo, one daughter died at the age of ten in England, and three other daughters lived to adulthood. Increasingly, Mary Shepheard spent long periods in England with her surviving small children. On a visit home on the strength of his Crimean War gains, Shepheard bought a farm at Radway, near Edgehill, Warwickshire; this he sold on a subsequent visit in 1857 and bought his eventual retirement home, Eathorpe Hall, near Leamington. Shepheard died at Eathorpe Hall on 12 June 1866, aged fifty. He was survived by his wife.<br>
