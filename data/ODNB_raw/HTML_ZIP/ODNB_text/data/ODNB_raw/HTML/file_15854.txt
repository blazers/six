<span class="headword">John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1190), <span class="occ">soldier and landowner</span>, was the son of Richard fitz Eustace (<i>d</i>. 1163) and Albreda (or Aubrey) de Lisours (<i>d</i>. 1194). Albreda was a daughter and heir of Robert de Lacy (<i>d</i>. 1193). Although the two families' interests intertwined, it is inaccurate to use the Lacy surname of John: as a frequent and prominent witness to the charters of the earls of Chester he appears consistently as &#145;John the constable of Chester&#146;. John served in this capacity&#151;the chief official of the earls of Chester&#151;from 1163, first under Earl Hugh (<i>d</i>. 1181), and then under Earl Ranulf (III) (<i>d</i>. 1232). He was preceded in this position first by his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9614/', "Eustace fitz John, lord of Knaresborough and Halton")</script> (who was killed in July 1157 in a Welsh ambush at Counsylth near Basingwerk, Flintshire, during Henry II's campaign against Owain Gwynedd), and then by his father. John married Alice, daughter of Robert of Essex and his wife, Alice. His younger brother Robert fitz Richard became prior of the hospitallers in England.<br>
<br>In 1166 John paid a fine of 1000 marks to have his mother's estates. Some time after 1172 he founded the Cistercian abbey of Stanlaw in Cheshire and the hospital at Castle Donington. Earl Hugh granted him lands in Antrobus in Cheshire and <i>c</i>.1178 confirmed John's grant of Stanney to Stanlaw Abbey. Soon thereafter the earl freed the monks of Stanlaw from paying tolls in Chester. During the rebellion against Henry II in 1173 John was a firm supporter of the king. In early May 1181, when Hugh de Lacy lost royal favour and was recalled from his post as justiciar in Ireland, John and Richard Peche, the bishop of Coventry, and an itinerant justice, were sent to command Dublin in his stead. However, before Hugh departed they joined him in building numerous castles in Leinster. John and Richard were recalled to England during the following winter when Hugh de Lacy returned. John was present at the coronation of King Richard on 3 September 1189 and departed England in March 1190 to participate in the third crusade. His death later that year at the siege of Acre probably occurred on 11 October.<br>
<br>After his death John was succeeded as constable by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15861/', "Roger de Lacy (d. 1211)")</script>, who adopted the surname Lacy when he inherited his grandmother Albreda's estates at Clitheroe and Pontefract after her death in 1194. John's other children included Richard of Chester, who contracted leprosy and was buried at Norton Priory; a son Geoffrey; and another son Eustace of Chester, who may have been illegitimate. John the constable's descendants became earls of Lincoln in the thirteenth century.<br>
