<span class="headword">Marshal, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1235), <span class="occ">baron and justice</span>, of Hingham (or Hockering), was on the evidence of one of his charters to Walsingham Priory an illegitimate son of John Marshal of Hampstead Marshall (<i>c</i>.1145&#150;1194), the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William Marshal the elder, earl of Pembroke")</script>. His mother was probably Alice de Colleville, wife of a Sussex landowner, William de Colleville. This John is therefore one of the few instances where both parents of a child born of an adulterous aristocratic relationship can be discovered. John Marshal was acknowledged by his father and brought up in his household, and after 1194 in the household of his uncle. He was with his uncle in Flanders in 1197 and in Normandy in 1198. But John's success at court may not have been entirely his uncle's doing. His father had been seneschal of King John while the latter was count of Mortain, and may have died while doing him military service. This would account for the fact that the bastard John Marshal was able to survive untroubled his uncle's fall from grace in 1205 and continue to accumulate grants and favour. As castellan of Falaise in 1203 Marshal fought the French advance into Normandy. He retired to England early in 1204. His uncle sent him to Leinster in April 1204 to act as his seneschal for Ireland; he is to be found active there in 1205 and he may have still been there to greet Earl William on his arrival in February 1207.<br>
<br>John Marshal returned with the earl when summoned by King John in autumn 1207, receiving a royal grant of the marshalcy of Ireland and land there. Seemingly untouched by his uncle's disgrace, he stayed with the royal court, and was a banneret in the king's army that sailed to Ireland in 1210. With suspicious ease he resumed the role of Earl William's lieutenant when his uncle returned to England and royal favour in May 1213. It may be that his independent presence at the royal court had been useful to his uncle for intelligence and partisan purposes. He was one of the royalist barons at Runnymede in June 1215, and in its unhappy aftermath had the keeping of several key shires (Somerset, Dorset, and Worcestershire), within the area where his uncle was powerful. In September 1215 he was one of John's ambassadors to Rome, and was back in England before the new year. He then attended the king on his northern campaign, and was at his deathbed at Newark in October 1216. In March 1217 John Marshal's position in the west country was enhanced by a grant of the keeping of Devizes Castle. Here he established himself as a dominant regional castellan, and, in partnership with Earl William (I) Longesp&eacute;e of Salisbury, subjected a wide area of Wiltshire to forced exactions. In May 1217 he was one of his uncle's bannerets at the battle of Lincoln, and acted as his uncle's emissary to summon the Anglo-French besiegers of the castle to surrender. With Philip d'Aubigny, Marshal was a leader in the decisive sea battle off Sandwich.<br>
<br>John Marshal accumulated great rewards from victory. In November 1217 he became chief justice of the forests, a post he held until February 1221. In 1217&#150;18 he had custody of the earldom of Devon and the Isle of Wight. In 1218 he was a justice on eyre in the north midlands. Following his uncle's death in May 1219 he entered into an even closer political partnership with the younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "Earl William Marshal")</script>, his cousin. Just after his father's death the new Earl William used Sir John's seal until he could have his own dies cut, and acknowledged him as &#145;my beloved cousin&#146;: when William died, John Marshal was to be his chief executor. The Irish interests of Earl William (II) Marshal kept John Marshal frequently engaged in Ireland as a justice both for the king and his cousin. In 1223&#150;4 he had the keeping of the Lacy lordship of Ulster. Elsewhere, he was an ambassador to France in the summer of 1225, and confronted the papal nuncio Otto on the king's behalf in January 1226. In June 1230 he was commissioner in an assize of arms for Norfolk and Suffolk. After Earl William (II)'s death in 1231 he was appointed as castellan to keep Pembrokeshire until the succession of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18124/', "Richard Marshal")</script> was confirmed; the succession ended his active link with the Marshal affinity, although he acted frequently in his capacity as executor for Earl William (II). He did not support the rebellion of Richard Marshal in 1233&#150;4, and was at the royal court in 1234&#150;5.<br>
<br>John Marshal had died between February and 27 June 1235, when his elder son, John, did homage for the manor of Haselbury, Somerset, which was held in chief. John Marshal made a significant number of donations to monastic houses: to Luffield Priory, near his Northamptonshire seat of Norton, and to Walsingham Priory, near his other estate centres in Norfolk. Like his uncle he was also a patron of the templars. He had married his wife, Aline de Ryes, heir of the East Anglian barony of Hingham or Hockering in 1200. She survived him, holding the Ryes lands until 1267, when she died in her nineties. Their elder son, John Marshal, married Margaret, sister and heir of Thomas, earl of Warwick, who died in June 1242, and was briefly earl of Warwick before his own death in October 1242. He was succeeded by his younger brother, William Marshal of Norton, who participated in the baronial rebellion on the Montfortian side and died in 1265, during the fighting. William was succeeded by his son John Marshal, who succeeded his grandmother in the barony of Hockering two years later, came of age in 1278, and died in 1282. The family became extinct in the male line in 1316, with the death of John's grandson, John, whose father, William Marshal of Norton, had been killed at Bannockburn two years earlier.<br>
