</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Durbin,  Evan Frank Mottram</span>  (1906&#150;1948), <span class="occ">economist and politician</span>, was born at the manse, Westcroft, Bideford, Devon, on 1 March 1906, the son and last child of the Revd Frank Durbin, a Baptist minister in Devon, and his wife, Mary Louisa Mellor, the daughter of William Mottram, a well-known Congregationalist minister and temperance campaigner. Durbin was educated at elementary schools in Plympton and Exmouth, Heles School, Exeter, and Taunton School, winning an open scholarship at New College, Oxford. From 1924 he read zoology, but laboratory work failed to inspire him and he took a second-class degree in 1927. He then transferred to modern Greats and completed a first-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1929. With the support of his economics tutor, Lionel Robbins, Durbin was awarded the Ricardo scholarship in 1929 to study underconsumptionist theories at University College, London. In autumn 1930 he was appointed to a lectureship in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he remained until 1940.<h2>
<a name="TheLabourPartyandeconomicplanning"></a>The Labour Party and economic planning</h2>Durbin's nonconformist background provided the foundation for his later work. His strict but loving upbringing imparted to him a confidence and frankness that blended humility with conviction in all his work. Although his faith ebbed during his undergraduate years, like many future Labour politicians he first learned the art of public speaking as a local Baptist preacher. His political interests were evident from the outset at Oxford, where he was active in both the union and the Oxford University Labour Club, serving as chairman of the latter in 1927. He also made many friends at Oxford who shaped his later work. He was introduced there to Reginald Bassett, G. D. H. Cole, and Margaret Cole, and he met Hugh Gaitskell in 1926 when both men were working on behalf of the miners during the general strike, initiating a lifelong friendship and political association.<br>
<br>Durbin established his credentials as an economist in the early 1930s with a series of books and articles on contemporary economic conditions, including <span class="italic">Purchasing Power and Trade Depression</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Socialist Credit Policy</span> (1933; revised 1935), and <span class="italic">The Problem of Credit Policy</span> (1935), but in its abstract form economics never captured his imagination. He saw instead the role that economists could play in developing a democratic socialist society. The aftermath of the Labour government's defeat in 1931 provided ideal circumstances for Durbin's ideas to become influential in the Labour Party. He was a prominent member of both the New Fabian Research Bureau and the XYZ Club, groups of left-wing intellectuals committed to finding new directions for socialism and economic policy. Through these groups he worked closely with other young economists such as Douglas Jay, James Meade, and Colin Clark to revise Labour's programme in the light of new economic research. The results were evident in the party's growing commitment to economic planning in the late 1930s, paving the way for the introduction of centralized controls during the Second World War and the continuation of a commitment to planning in the post-war Labour government.<br>
<br>By the mid-1930s Durbin had become committed to economic planning as the most effective means to achieve socialist ends. He believed that a fully planned economy was a precondition for socialism, and his work was increasingly directed towards implementing this idea. But those who knew him best observed that he was a man of conviction who possessed a great deal of what Gaitskell termed &#145;moral courage&#146;. He was not afraid to take an unpopular line and his ideas often set him apart from the labour movement at this time. In particular, he emphasized the affinities between Soviet communism and European fascism, insisting that both Germany and Russia were dictatorships characterized by similar types of cruelties and injustices against their people. He pointed to the Russians' brutal treatment of kulaks, for example, and likened it to the mass persecution of German Jews. To compare communism to fascism in this way was brave at a time when Soviet-style communism enjoyed much support among prominent British socialists such as Harold Laski, John Strachey, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Durbin insisted, however, that communism, just as much as fascism, was incompatible with the commitment to democracy, social justice, and personal freedom that lay at the heart of British socialism. The defence of these values was central to Durbin's anti-Marxism, and his views both set him apart in the 1930s and early 1940s, and proved to be highly influential long after his death.<br>
<br>Durbin diverged from his colleagues in other ways as well. Almost alone among his friends, he endorsed the Munich agreement in 1938. His support for Chamberlain originated not in pacifism, but&#151;like so many of his ideas&#151;in patriotism, because he was convinced that Britain did not yet have the strength to fight. Foreshadowing the frustrations of the Labour government in the late 1940s, he also insisted upon the need for trade unions to recognize the community's interests in efforts to plan the economy, especially in areas such as wage controls. While many other economists in the Labour Party were eager to evaluate Keynes's ideas in a socialist context, Durbin found Keynes's indifference to the moral claims of socialism unacceptable and distrusted his liberal roots. Finally, he was critical of Jay's and Hugh Dalton's economic criteria for socialism when economic theory, for Durbin, was primarily a vehicle to convey social and ethical imperatives within a socialist society.<br>
<br>Durbin believed strongly that economics should not be studied in isolation. His most original ideas were informed by broad reading in psychology, psychoanalysis, sociology, history, and political science, and the combination of these fields with his economic research resulted in a formulation of democratic socialism that was both distinctive and influential. Durbin joined a study group on psychoanalysis and he urged greater communication and co-operation among social scientists. His work focused increasingly on evaluating the relationship between economics, psychology, and equality, which he believed to be central to the realization of a socialist society. He criticized economists' reluctance to depart from their belief in the unproven benefits of inequality, and he exhorted the profession to reconsider the ethical implications of the assumption that inequality promoted a more efficient economic system. The clearest example of his wide-ranging interests was <span class="italic">Personal Aggressiveness and War</span> (1939), which he wrote with the child psychologist John Bowlby. Here Durbin argued that new research into the origins of aggressive behaviour among animals and children by, among others, Solly Zuckerman and Susan Isaacs, might be used to understand and ultimately to prevent the tendency among adults to wage war.<h2>
<a name="DemocraticsocialismandtheSecondWorldWar"></a>Democratic socialism and the Second World War</h2>These ideas not only reflected the anxieties of the time, but also formed the core of Durbin's most complete and influential work, <span class="italic">The Politics of Democratic Socialism</span> (1940). Composed against the background of impending war, the book explored the potential for the emergence of a society based upon the twin principles of social democracy and economic planning. Drawing on his research with Bowlby, as well as Freudian concepts such as repression, projection, and transference, Durbin devoted the first section of the book to a discussion of the need for changes in the social and educational environment of children to encourage a preference for co-operation over aggression. Echoing R. H. Tawney, Durbin argued that economic relations had a direct bearing on social relations. Therefore, while he still believed that socialism was impossible without a fully planned economy, he was convinced that socialist societies must be founded around institutions that both met common needs and emphasized the importance of healthy group relations.<br>
<br>In subsequent sections of <span class="italic">The Politics of Democratic Socialism</span>, Durbin went on to address alternatives to socialism, outlining the weaknesses of contemporary capitalism and offering a rigorous critique of the internal inconsistencies of Marxism that anticipated Anthony Crosland's similarly clear rejection of an episodic transition to socialism in <span class="italic">The Future of Socialism</span> (1956). Durbin rejected, in particular, the idea of a universal historical dialectic that excluded all but economic factors. He observed that other variables such as nationality, government, social relationships, and religion were ignored by Marxists in their pursuit of a growing conflict between two distinct classes. &#145;It is not so,&#146; Durbin countered. &#145;We are more complicated than the Marxists have us believe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Politics of Democratic Socialism</span>, 1940, 182&#150;3). He concluded the book (which was subtitled &#145;An essay on social policy&#146;) with arguments for the achievement of a democratic socialist society through the Labour Party's programme. He returned repeatedly to the centrality of democracy, the foundation on which he based his certainty that socialism was possible in Britain without revolution. Throughout <span class="italic">The Politics of Democratic Socialism</span>, Durbin both drew upon and reinforced the indigenous British tradition of democratic socialism. He presented a blend of ideas influenced by ethical socialism in the tradition of Tawney, by the Fabian interest in efficiency, by liberalism, and by advances in economic thought since 1931. It was therefore fitting that when Durbin dedicated the book &#145;to my friends&#146;, he included among them Bassett, Gaitskell, Michael Postan, and Tawney.<br>
<br>In 1940 the war intervened directly in Durbin's career when he was assigned to the economic section of the war cabinet secretariat. Although he had eagerly volunteered for wartime work, he was unhappy at giving up his teaching and research at the LSE and he soon found that he disliked the civil service. In October 1942, however, he was appointed personal assistant to the deputy prime minister, Clement Attlee, a position he held for three years. This civil service experience expanded his practical knowledge of government and reinforced for him the critical role of economists and social scientists in the negotiation of a new relationship between state and citizen, both in wartime and under the post-war Labour government.<br>
<br>The war presented Durbin with an opportunity to put into practice his commitment to using force against those who could not be swayed by reason. While serving in the wartime government, he completed his most compelling and accessible work, a short, intensely patriotic tract entitled <span class="italic">What have we to defend?</span> (1942). This little book drew on his earlier writing to explore the connection between British socialism and national identity, and to evaluate the potential for economic and social change offered by the war. It was a more impassioned and less technical work than Durbin's earlier writing. Like George Orwell in <span class="italic">The Lion and the Unicorn</span> (1941), Durbin argued that nationalism and socialism were not antithetical. He believed that patriotic socialists were not defending the British social order, but rather protecting British values against external aggression. He also identified the threat of forces operating within Britain. He found four &#145;national faults&#146; at work: economic inequality, social inequality, disregard for national heritage, and lack of imagination. He urged the British people to dream of a better world, a strong and safe society free from poverty, unemployment, and class divisions. &#145;This society does not yet exist&#146;, Durbin concluded, &#145;but only because we do not see it&#146;  (<span class="italic">What have we to defend?</span>, 34).<h2>
<a name="Electiontoparliamentdeathandlegacy"></a>Election to parliament, death, and legacy</h2>In July 1945 Durbin was elected Labour MP for the north London constituency of Edmonton with a majority of 19,069. He had earlier stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in East Grinstead and Gillingham, Kent, in 1931 and 1935 respectively. In government he was frustrated by the slow progress of his career. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, Dalton, until March 1947, when he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of works, Charles Key. These roles slowed but did not interrupt Durbin's writing, and he continued to comment upon contemporary issues and engage directly with the government's critics, most notably his former LSE colleague, Friedrich Hayek.<br>
<br>Durbin was no dry intellectual. Married on 29 July 1932 to (Alice) Marjorie (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), the daughter of Charles Ernest Green, a teacher, he thrived on family life, enjoying the company of his wife and their three children, two daughters and one son. His openness and capacity for enjoyment attracted a wide circle of friends, among them historians, sociologists, and political scientists. He loved the countryside and the cinema, enjoyed playing racquet sports (though with little skill), and had a passion for detective stories. He once remarked to his friend Gaitskell, &#145;The three greatest pleasures in my life are food, sleep and sex&#146;  (Gaitskell, 13).<br>
<br>Durbin drowned on 3 September 1948 off the coast of Cornwall at Strangles Beach, Crackington Haven, near Bude, after rescuing one of his daughters and another child in dangerous surf. A memorial service was held at St Margaret's, Westminster, at which Tawney gave an address, and he was buried in New College, Oxford. Durbin's premature death robbed the Labour Party of a man of considerable intellectual rigour, economic expertise, and moral conviction. At the time of his death, Durbin was working on a companion to <span class="italic">The Politics of Democratic Socialism</span>, provisionally entitled &#145;The economics of democratic socialism&#146;, which built on his post-war concerns about the efficient working of a planned economy, labour relations, nationalized industries, and the steps still required to take Britain from a managed capitalist economy to a fully socialist society. Draft chapters of this work are preserved with Durbin's papers at the LSE, and eleven of his most influential articles were posthumously reprinted as <span class="italic">Problems of Economic Planning</span> (1949).<br>
<br>Subsequent generations of British socialists and social democrats have continued to be influenced by Durbin's ideas. His legacy has been particularly apparent in two periods: first, during the difficulties that beset the Labour Party in opposition throughout the 1950s; and second, in the founding of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. In the 1950s Durbin's mantle was inherited by his close friend Gaitskell, who succeeded Clement Attlee as Labour leader in 1955. Gaitskell and his supporters looked to Durbin as a &#145;revisionist&#146; ally against leftwing &#145;fundamentalists&#146; in the party whose definition of socialism placed greater emphasis upon the expansion of public control through the nationalization of major industries. Like Durbin, Gaitskell argued that nationalization was a means, and not an end, of socialism, and he therefore supported a far-reaching review of Labour's policies that recommended alternative methods of control. The most prominent theorist of &#145;revisionism&#146; in this period, Crosland, also clearly felt an affinity with Durbin, whom he had met in the 1940s. Crosland envisioned a &#145;Durbin&#150;Crosland front&#146; in democratic socialism  (22 April 1941, Crosland MSS, BLPES, 3/26/i), not only agreeing with Durbin that capitalism had shown itself to be capable of significant reforms, but also sharing Durbin's deep antipathy towards Marxism and his commitment to the distinctly British ethical and democratic socialist traditions.<br>
<br>Durbin has also provided a link to the SDP, whose founders have claimed an intellectual lineage from the Gaitskellite &#145;revisionists.&#146; Bill Rodgers, in particular, was strongly influenced and deeply moved by Durbin's work, and he greatly admired Durbin's conviction that force should be used to defend socialist values if all else failed. For the SDP, Durbin's writing in the 1930s provided a model for a successful fight against the left within the Labour Party, together with a clear rejection of totalitarianism, pacifism, and, by extension, unilateralism. More importantly, Durbin provided a cogent demonstration of Marxism's internal contradictions and the weakness of Marx within the British social democratic tradition.<br>
<br>Durbin's status as a &#145;revisionist&#146; should not, however, be overstated. In many respects, Durbin's ideas did not fit the Gaitskellite mould that the SDP admired. Durbin developed his ideas in the 1930s and his major post-war work was unfinished at the time of his death. Nevertheless it is clear that after the war he remained firmly committed to nationalization, economic planning, and controls. Although Durbin recommended flexibility in Labour's policies, his priority was the economic and social management of an expanded public sector, and he had none of Crosland's later confidence in the potential of reformed capitalism. Durbin's anti-Marxism and his commitment to democracy and freedom were attractive to &#145;revisionists&#146;, and subsequently to the SDP, but these general aims are found within a broader tradition of British social democracy, while the substance of Durbin's policy ideas locates him less clearly among &#145;revisionists&#146;. Throughout his life Durbin placed great emphasis on remaining a man of the left, not only a social democrat, but also a democratic socialist.<br>
