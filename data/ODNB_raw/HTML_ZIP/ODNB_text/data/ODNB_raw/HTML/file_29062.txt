<span class="headword">Werburh</span> <span class="st"> [St Werburh, Werburgh, Werburga]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 700<span class="mult">x</span>07), <span class="occ">abbess</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30093/', "Wulfhere, king of Mercia")</script> (<i>r</i>. 658&#150;75), and of Eormenhild, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39239/', "Eorcenberht (d. 664), king of Kent")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25150/', "St Seaxburh")</script>. Her career is the subject of a number of not wholly consistent traditions. According to the Worcester chronicle and to her life, Werburh early showed a disposition towards the religious life and after Wulfhere's death entered the monastery of Ely where her great-aunt &AElig;thelthryth (<i>d</i>. 679) was abbess. Later she was recalled to Mercia by her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52315/', "&#198;thelred")</script>, Wulfhere's brother and successor, and given authority over the nunneries of his kingdom. She performed miracles while living on her father's estate at Weedon, in the later Northamptonshire, and died in her monastery of &#145;Triccengeham&#146; (almost certainly Threekingham, Lincolnshire). After some dissension she was buried in accordance with her wishes in the monastery of Hanbury, in west Mercia, where nine years later her body was elevated at the command of her cousin, the Mercian King Ceolred (<i>r</i>. 709&#150;16), and found to be miraculously uncorrupted. Her relics remained enshrined at Hanbury until the Danish invasions, shortly after which they were removed to Chester. By then the body had crumbled into dust.<br>
<br>A different tradition, first recorded in Old English writings from Kent and elaborated at Ely in the mid-twelfth century, alleges that Werburh succeeded her grandmother and mother as abbess in turn of Seaxburh's Kentish foundation of Sheppey and of Ely. Such a claim, however, is difficult to reconcile with the short space of time that elapsed between the deaths of Seaxburh (after 695) and Werburh herself (700x07). More dubious still are William of Malmesbury's assertion that the saint was a nun at Chester and the story linking her with Wulfhere's supposed sons, venerated at Stone.<br>
<br>Werburh's cult appears to have been promoted by Mercian kings both in their own homelands and in Kent; her origins made it an obvious vehicle for attempts to foster links between the two kingdoms. Later she was venerated at Ely where her maternal relatives were buried and where her life, traditionally attributed to Goscelin, was composed in the late eleventh century. From the tenth century, however, the main focus of her cult was Chester, where her remains were enshrined in the minster later known as St Werburgh's, probably at the command of &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d (<i>d</i>. 918), lady of the Mercians. The cult was especially active in the twelfth century after the refoundation of the minster as a Benedictine monastery in 1093. In addition to the saint's early feast day (3 March), a new commemoration, St Werburh &#145;in summer&#146;, was celebrated there on 21 June. In the earlier fourteenth century the saint was housed in an elegant shrine, and in the early sixteenth a life in English verse, based on local sources since lost, was composed by Henry Bradshaw, a monk of Chester.<br>
<br>Some thirteen medieval parish churches and two chapels were dedicated to the saint. They included several minsters in the Mercian heartlands, one in Kent, and an early church in London, perhaps reflecting the early promotion of the cult at major centres, ecclesiastical and urban, in the Mercian kingdom. Other dedications, such as those at Dublin and Bristol, were probably diffused from the cult centre in Chester.<br>
<br>At the Reformation, St Werburgh's Abbey became the cathedral of the new see of Chester. The shrine, dismantled by 1635, was reconstructed in 1888 and placed behind the high altar of Chester Cathedral.<br>
