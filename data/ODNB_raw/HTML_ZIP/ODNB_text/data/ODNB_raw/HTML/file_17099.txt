</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowndes,  William</span>  (1652&#150;1724), <span class="occ">Treasury official</span>, was born at Winslow, Buckinghamshire, on 1 November 1652, the younger son of Robert Lowndes (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1683) and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter Fitzwilliams. Lowndes was descended from an old Cheshire gentry family, a cadet branch of which had established itself at Winslow early in the sixteenth century. His father had avoided participation in the civil war by emigrating to the American colonies, but returned to Winslow after the execution of Charles I. The family were impoverished minor gentry, and young William's formal education advanced no further than his attendance at the free school at nearby Buckingham. In 1667 he went to live in London. Precisely when his lifelong connection with the Treasury began has not been ascertained, but the records reveal that he was established there as a clerk by 1675, which may suggest that his government career had begun in a minor capacity some years before.<br>
<br>Lowndes quickly excelled as a versatile and promising government servant. At first under the tutelage of the lord treasurer, Danby, he impressed Charles II in 1676 with the thoroughness of an investigation he conducted into racketeering by the sub-farmers of the coffee duties, and was afterwards regularly on duty at Treasury board meetings at Windsor and Newmarket, depending on where the royal court was based. His varied responsibilities in these early years also brought him closely in touch with the House of Commons. Here, he acted as an essential channel of communication to Lord Danby, advising him in relation to the detail and progress of money bills through the house, and providing drafts of proposed clauses requiring the consideration of the various revenue departments. In March 1679 Danby procured for him a customs sinecure (surrendered in 1680) and the reversion to an office in the duchy of Cornwall, though Lowndes subsequently regarded these as inconsiderable rewards.<br>
<br>Late in 1679 Henry Guy, a financier with strong connections at court, was appointed secretary to the Treasury and soon came to regard Lowndes as a rare talent in the running of the Treasury office. He chose Lowndes as his chief or senior clerk, though it is not known when this appointment was actually made. Initially, it may not have been a formal arrangement, but it is clear that Lowndes began deputizing for Guy in Treasury affairs as early as 1680. Their association endured with mutual benefit for many years. Lowndes operated alongside the small number of other senior clerks, including such long-serving men as Robert Squibb, William Shaw, and Samuel Langford. The 1680s saw a significant expansionist phase in the development of the Treasury, during which Guy was ably assisted by Lowndes's financial expertise and command of administrative detail. Lowndes became an expert on the complex and arcane workings of the exchequer, upon which he produced a handbook in 1684&#150;5, and was highly skilled in drafting complex documentation. By the mid-1680s he was suggesting important improvements in procedure, and in 1685 Guy procured for him the additional post of agent for taxes, responsible for co-ordinating the work of the provincial receivers-general, with a salary of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Lowndes was less fortunate in his personal life. He married four times between 1679 and 1691, each of his first three wives dying young. His first wife was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1680), the daughter of Sir Roger Harsnett of Dulwich, Kent, whom he married on 26 October 1679, and with whom he had one son, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1727). His second wife, whom he married on 25 November 1683, was Jane (<i>d</i>. 1685), the daughter of Simon Hopper of Richmond, Surrey, with whom he had a daughter. On 12 July 1686 he married, third, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1689), the daughter of the Revd Dr Richard Martin, and added another son and daughter to his family. He married, fourth, on 29 November 1691, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1742), the daughter of John Shales, a colleague of Lowndes in the exchequer, a relationship which endured fruitfully until Lowndes's death. Between 1692 and 1710 their marriage produced seven sons and seven daughters, though Lowndes was survived by only three of the sons &#151; one of whom, Charles (<i>b</i>. 1699) was himself briefly treasury secretary &#151; and by four of the daughters.<br>
<br>Although for political reasons Guy was removed from the Treasury following the revolution of 1688 until being reinstated in 1691, Lowndes remained in his post unscathed. The turning point in his career came suddenly in February 1695 when Guy was sent to the Tower on charges of corruption. The Treasury lords immediately nominated Lowndes as acting secretary, a role he had briefly performed in 1691, but left open the question of Guy's successor. Guy's destruction at the hands of the junto Whigs had in fact been only partial since his patron, Lord Sunderland, retained the goodwill of William III who allowed Guy the liberty of naming his successor. Lowndes was a natural choice, not only on account of his mastery of Treasury business, but also because he lacked political experience and was without political connection. With Lowndes in charge of the Treasury secretariat, Guy could expect to exercise a continuing influence in Treasury business, which would serve both his own and Sunderland's purposes. In facilitating this arrangement, Lowndes agreed that Guy should continue to receive the profits of the secretary's office while restricting himself to a salary of &pound;1000 (later increased to &pound;1200), which in the mid-1690s was less than half the net value of the secretary's office. Even after Guy's career had faded by the end of the decade, the payments to him continued, possibly until his death in 1710, and were justified by Lowndes to the Treasury board in 1702 as &#145;an acknowledgement to a person he had been so beholden to&#146;  (TNA: PRO, T64/126, fols. 247&#150;8, quoted in Baxter, 201).<br>
<br>Lowndes kissed the king's hand for his new office on 24 April 1695. He had already become involved in the government's efforts to resolve the worsening coinage crisis. The practice of &#145;clipping&#146; hammered silver coin had reached the point where it was seriously affecting the Treasury's ability to pay its way in the war with France, and in late 1694 confidence in the silver coinage weakened dramatically. A complete reminting of the coinage was now imperative, but the problem facing a House of Commons committee early in 1695 was whether there should be a temporary devaluation in order to stabilize the currency while the old money was reminted, a primary concern being to offset the inevitable loss in the value of tax receipts. Earlier generations of historians, focusing upon the publication of opposing views on the subject by Lowndes and the philosopher John Locke, have portrayed Lowndes as the main exponent of devaluation and refer to the public difference of opinion between the two men as &#145;the Locke&#150;Lowndes controversy&#146;. More recent investigation, however, casts doubt on whether the views published under Lowndes's name on the Treasury's behalf represented his personal views. In a written report to the Treasury board in January 1695 Lowndes actually ruled out any suggestion of devaluation. While modestly conceding a limited grasp of the complexities behind the issue, he envisaged an immediate loss of some &pound;150,000 in revenue, which would have to be met by a &#145;public tax&#146;, and a worrying increase in the cost of England's military payments abroad.<br>
<br>The recoinage proposals put forward by the House of Commons in April 1695 embodied a nominal rate of 9 per cent devaluation, but received little notice, largely because Locke had earlier published a pamphlet against devaluation. But as the situation grew more urgent, Lowndes was instructed by the Treasury board in August to prepare a detailed scheme for recoinage, and since majority opinion on the board favoured devaluation it would appear that Lowndes was instructed to follow the scheme already proposed by the Commons. By mid-September his &#145;book&#146;, <span class="italic">A Report Containing an Essay for the Amendment of the Silver Coins</span>, was in Treasury hands. It embodied the Commons committee's resolutions and was fleshed out with much historical detail, but owing to the rapid increase in the market price of silver a devaluation rate of 20 per cent would now be necessary. William III and his ministers acknowledged Lowndes's ingenuity and scholarship but, disagreeing with the Treasury board, saw greater virtue in Locke's arguments for a recoinage at the old standard. Thus it was largely to assist the ministry's own scheme for recoinage in parliament that Lowndes's <span class="italic">Report</span> was subsequently published in November 1695, followed by Locke's <span class="italic">Further Considerations Concerning Raising the Value of Money</span>. While paying tribute to Lowndes's erudition, Locke was quick to point out that some of his arguments tended in fact to condemn devaluation of any kind. Moreover, the encouragement which Lowndes gave to Locke and other critics to publish their rebuttals of his <span class="italic">Report</span> would likewise suggest that Lowndes had never personally favoured devaluation. In January 1696 an act was passed for a recoinage at the existing standard.<br>
<br>At the general election in November 1695 Lowndes entered parliament for the Cinque Port town of Seaford in Sussex, a seat procured for him by the Pelham family, one of whom was a former member of the Treasury board. Lowndes's work as Treasury secretary settled in to a complex routine that would dominate the rest of his life. His controlling hand in all major aspects of Treasury administration was soon apparent in his deep involvement in the &#145;recoinage&#146; of 1696&#150;7, and in his initiation in 1697 of a major overhaul of exchequer procedure. His house, situated in the Broad Sanctuary near the west door of Westminster Abbey, proved a convenient meeting place for the Treasury commissioners after fire destroyed most of Whitehall, including the Treasury chambers, on the night of 4&#150;5 January 1698. He played an important part each year in planning the government's financial measures to be laid before the House of Commons. To this end he maintained close liaison with the various spending departments and revenue boards, and oversaw the collation of data for compiling the annual accounts of overall government income and expenditure. He was also involved in the finalization of borrowing arrangements with the monied companies and with individual financiers and bankers. In the Commons, Lowndes's special sphere of responsibility was the committee of ways and means; there he proposed and explained each year the agendas of financial measures which had originated under his scrutiny at the Treasury. Not infrequently, during the financial stress of war, the angry criticism of MPs placed heavy demands on his ingenuity, forcing him to find ways of modifying proposals, and on occasion he was forced to abandon them altogether. The task of managing major pieces of fiscal legislation through the house usually fell to others, but it was Lowndes who ensured that bills contained the correct level of detail needed to regulate the levy and collection of new duties.<br>
<br>Lowndes's mastery in Treasury matters was unchallenged for nearly thirty years, and he is recognized as one of the key figures in the &#145;financial revolution&#146;. During his early years as secretary, the Treasury began to consolidate its control over parliamentary finance, a process which saw much refinement under Lowndes's continued lead. The Treasury machinery itself underwent much rapid change during Queen Anne's reign under the pressure of an increasing wartime workload, and the expanded Treasury &#145;establishment&#146; which had emerged by 1714 bore characteristics which were to endure well into the nineteenth century. When faced with administrative failure or neglect, however, as often tended to occur among exchequer officials in their auditing of departmental accounts, Lowndes's improving hand entailed no more than an insistence on the observation of &#145;ancient&#146; rules. He was loyal to successive Treasury ministers regardless of their politics, and he became, in effect, a permanent secretary. His longest and closest working association, however, was with Lord Godolphin, who was lord treasurer during 1700&#150;01 and from 1702 until 1710. His scrupulous avoidance of party intrigue, and the fixed support which he gave to each ministry, was an important factor in the unstinting professionalism with which Lowndes approached his duties. He defied attempts by political analysts to classify him in terms of whig or tory, and at various times either party label was attached to him.<br>
<br>Portraits of Lowndes depict a man of stern countenance although he was said to be &#145;a sociable, good companion&#146; and a devoted Anglican  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.99). All too often, however, his colleagues saw a man whose almost constant engrossment in work was difficult to penetrate. His piety and rectitude were deeply ingrained features of his personality, and his long involvement in organizing the nation's finances was entirely without taint of peculation. Like most men in the higher echelons of government, Lowndes was nevertheless able to profit greatly from the perquisites of office. A shrewd manager of his own money, he bought up land in and around his native Winslow during the 1690s, purchasing the manor of Winslow itself in 1697 and rebuilding Winslow Hall over the next five years. He acquired other property: at Chesham, also in Buckinghamshire, at Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire, and in the fashionable metropolitan districts of St James's and Chelsea. It was appropriate, too, that he should use his position to secure salaried places at the Treasury and other government offices for several of his sons and sons-in-law, thus establishing a dynastic involvement in government administration which would continue for several generations.<br>
<br>Lord Treasurer Oxford's appointment of a joint secretary to the Treasury in June 1711 was primarily for political purposes, and Lowndes's hold over financial administration remained largely untouched. There was likewise never any doubt of his being retained at the Treasury after the Hanoverian succession. At the general election of 1715 he lost control of the seat he had held for many years at Seaford, but transferred to the Cornish pocket borough of St Mawes. A major Treasury priority during the early years of whig rule was to find ways of controlling the escalating national debt. In May 1717 he thus gave full support to the scheme for a &#145;sinking fund&#146;, designed ostensibly to reorganize the debt in such a way as would ensure its liquidation in the foreseeable future. The scheme had been devised by Robert Walpole but, amid the opening stages of the &#145;whig schism&#146;, was unveiled in the Commons by Walpole's opponent, the Treasury's new first lord, James Stanhope. In 1720 Lowndes had a large share in drafting the <span class="roman">South Sea Act</span> which gave authorization to the company's disastrous scheme for dealing with unfunded national debt, and which resulted in the South Sea Bubble and its bursting later in the year. He subsequently assisted Walpole, following the latter's return to the Treasury in April 1721, with the task of framing the <span class="roman">Act to Restore the Public Credit</span> which restructured the company's finances and its government obligations. It was duly introduced to the house by Lowndes on 2 August.<br>
<br>Renouncing his Cornish seat at the election of 1722, Lowndes stood for the populous London constituency of Westminster, but was defeated after a fierce contest. An alternative seat was found for him in October that year when he was brought in at a by-election for another Cornish borough, East Looe. Lowndes's death occurred on 20 January 1724, just four days after a routine appearance at the house; he was buried on 3 February in the family vault at Winslow constructed in 1700 when the church was handsomely refurbished at his expense. Walpole told MPs that they &#145;had lost a very useful Member, and the public as able and honest a servant as ever the crown had&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 20.242). According to Lord Chesterfield, writing in 1747, Lowndes was the originator of the maxim, &#145;take care of the pence for the pounds will take care of themselves&#146;  (Chesterfield, <span class="italic">Letters to his Son</span>, 6 Nov 1747).<br>
