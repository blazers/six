<span class="headword">King,  Robert</span>  (1599/1600&#150;1676), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Kent. He matriculated pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, on 5 July 1617, graduating BA in 1621 and proceeding MA in 1624. From 1625 he was a fellow of his college. On 16 January 1628 (or 1629) he was admitted proctor in the consistory court of the bishop of Ely. During academic year 1629&#150;30 he was junior proctor of the university. In 1636 he received the degree of LLD. That year King resigned his fellowship, and by 1637 he had married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Jasper Wareyn of Great Thurlow, Suffolk. The Jasper Wareyn who matriculated at Christ's five years before King, in 1612, was probably her brother.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1641 King was admitted advocate in the court of arches. From 1641 to 1664 he was official to the archdeacon of Suffolk, and from 1642 to 1645 held the additional office of commissary in that archdeaconry. In 1645 he became commissary in the neighbouring archdeaconry of Sudbury; this post he resigned in the same year, but he remained official of Sudbury from 1645 to 1674. On 28 October 1645 he was elected master of Trinity Hall, following the refusal of the place by the fellows' first choice, John Selden. King's election was approved by the House of Lords on 6 November, but the Commons were disinclined to endorse the promotion of a man so closely involved in the machinery of the Laudian church. The fellows of Trinity Hall were told to try again, and in March 1646 they elected John Bond.<br>
<br>King's sympathies were clearly with the royalist cause, and following the Restoration he was re-elected to the mastership on 20 August 1660. By the end of that year he had also been appointed chancellor, commissary, and vicar-general to Bishop Matthew Wren of Ely, retaining all three posts to his death. He was confirmed in office by the bishop's patent of 20 December 1662, and the diocesan records give ample evidence of the work he did there.<br>
<br>As master of Trinity Hall, King was involved in a running controversy over the appointment of clergymen to fellowships designated for laymen. The younger dons objected in particular to the crown's nomination of Robert Eade, who was in orders and who owed his MA to the king's mandate. In February 1666 the master of Corpus, Francis Wilford, sent the earl of Manchester an account of the disputes at Trinity Hall, observing that King was &#145;soe quiet and peaceable a person&#146; that he could not understand the fellows' behaviour. This (thought Wilford) must be because of King's &#145;great mildness &hellip; in government&#146;, since as an LLD he might be thought to know his own college's statutes  (Malden, 154). In March the matter was referred to a royal commission, which unsurprisingly upheld and extended the crown's right to nominate.<br>
<br>King died at Trinity Hall lodge on 6 November 1676 aged seventy-six, and was buried in the college chapel; a marble tomb slab displays his arms: sable, a lion rampant a la queue furch&eacute;e argent. His daughter Anne was buried at Great Thurlow in 1660, aged twenty-two. His only son, also Robert, entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1657 and trained for the law. He is said to have become vicar of Witcham, Cambridgeshire, in 1673; yet he is not mentioned in King's will of 17 April 1672. This left to his grandsons Robert, Henry, and Thomas a property at Sowley Green (near Great Thurlow) which King had bought. The interest in another landholding nearby at Great Bradley, which King had leased from St John's College, was passed to his widow. She was buried at Great Thurlow on 18 April 1684.<br>
