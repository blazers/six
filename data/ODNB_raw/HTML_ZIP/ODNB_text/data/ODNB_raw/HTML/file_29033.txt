<span class="headword">Welwood,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1566&#150;1624), <span class="occ">legal writer and mathematician</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Welwood (<i>d</i>. 1583), a prominent merchant burgess of St Andrews, and his wife, Janet Geddie (<i>d</i>. 1616); he had at least four sisters and three brothers. He matriculated at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1566 and graduated BA in 1569 and MA in 1570. In October 1573 he matriculated at the University of Wittenberg, where he may have taken the degree of LLD. In the early 1570s, his family was high in the favour of the regime of the regent, James Douglas, earl of Morton, and on 26 December 1575 he was gifted the office of third master in St Mary's College. His duty was to teach the mathematical sciences. At an unknown date he married Christina Cunningham; they had at least one son, David.<br>
<br>Welwood belonged to a cultivated group of scientists in the university and taught not only arithmetic, geometry, geography, and astronomy, but also map making, the use of the astrolabe, calendars, and horology, practical disciplines of interest to the son of a merchant. It is possible that he was an early influence on the distinguished map maker Timothy Pont, then a student at St Andrews. In 1577, with John Geddie, former servitor to George Buchanan, a skilled mathematician and probably a relative, he gained a patent for an improved method of raising water from wells, about which he later published <span class="italic">Guilielmi Velvod de aqua in altum per fistulas plumbeas facile exprimenda apologia demonstratiua</span> (1582). Dedicated to the earl of Bothwell, <span class="italic">De aqua</span> probably gained Welwood the title &#145;his hienes mathematicien&#146; that he held by 1583, when, with Edward Bruce, advocate and future courtier of James VI, he gained a licence for an engine to pump out coalmines.<br>
<br>This success came in the context of attempts by the masters of St Mary's, who had been opposed to Welwood's admittance, to remove him from his post. A visitation of the university in 1579 transferred the mathematician and lawyer to St Salvator's College, but here too the appointment was unpopular with the masters, this time ostensibly because of its financial implications. However, while there may have been genuine grounds for grievance here, the unremitting hostility he encountered from the provost, James Martin, seems to have derived from or been intensified by a feud between Martin's family and that of Welwood. The origins of the feud are unknown. On one side were the Arthurs, who included several sons of Margaret Martin, the provost's cousin. These brothers were also the brothers-in-law of the new archbishop of St Andrews, Patrick Adamson; they were supported by the powerful Learmonth of Dairsie family, whose members were regularly elected as provosts of the burgh. On the other side were the Welwoods, with their relatives the Geddies and the Smiths. Enriching the brew of hostility was the Welwoods' strong support for Andrew Melville, the noted advocate of presbyterianism in the reformed kirk in Scotland and powerful reforming principal of St Mary's College, who had also provided introductory verses for Welwood's <span class="italic">De aqua</span>.<br>
<br>In 1584 the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> had asserted crown authority over the kirk, marking the temporary eclipse of the Melville faction. In 1587 Welwood transferred to the chair of law, replacing John Arthur, one of the brothers; whether this move had any connection with the feud is unknown. In the hothouse atmosphere of religious and family tension in St Andrews, however, these political and local developments resulted in the attempt of Henry Hamilton, servitor to the archbishop, to murder Welwood (whom he had earlier assaulted) as he went to lecture. In the general tumult, James Arthur, one of the brothers, was killed. The dispute between the families was put to arbitration, resulting in the banishment from Scotland of James Smith, John Welwood, and John Geddie and the banishment of some others from St Andrews, including Thomas Geddie. This was a severe punishment on a set of families who made their living as merchants; John Geddie, for example, had six children to support.<br>
<br>In 1590 Welwood published in Edinburgh <span class="italic">The sea law of Scotland. Shortly gathered and plainly dressit for the reddy use of all seafairing men</span>. In a dedication to King James, this short work called for a reformation of justice. Indeed legal reform was much in the air in Scotland at this time and Welwood's convinced presbyterianism induced him no doubt to hope for a godly reform. The work is essentially aimed at explaining the law underpinning the type of trading carried on in the small vessels that characterized Scottish shipping, focusing on the duties of the master of the vessel. Politics now favoured the Welwoods. In 1592 Archbishop Adamson died, while parliament recognized the Melvillian structure of the kirk. The financial disputes between Martin and Welwood and Homer Blair (the new mathematician) were settled. The municipal elections of 1593 in St Andrews favoured the supporters of Melville. In 1594 James Melville, nephew of Andrew, solicited the king for the return of John Welwood and James Smith from exile, although the men had either to submit to trial or to satisfy the Arthurs with compensation. In 1595 King James recommended to the provost and council of St Andrews that there should be a reconciliation between the Welwoods and the Arthurs. By September 1596 it appears that considerable progress had been made in this through negotiations involving the presbytery of St Andrews.<br>
<br>In 1594 Welwood published a number of works abroad, perhaps to escape the control of the privy council. That summer he spent time in Leiden, where he issued two works concerned with the relationship between Jewish law and Roman law. <span class="italic">Juris divini Judaeorum, ac juris civilis Romanorum parallela</span>, dedicated to John Kennedy, earl of Cassillis, and John Lindsay, Lord Lindsay, supporters of the presbyterians, had an appendix on ecclesiastical law. This appendix contained a letter to Welwood from Franciscus Junius while the two radical ministers of St Andrews, David Black and Robert Wallace, were addressed by Welwood in a letter. <span class="italic">Filios Lucis esse prudentiores filiis huius seculi</span>, dedicated to the great Dutchman Oldenbarnevelt, devoted considerable attention to the issue of sale. These works of Welwood deserve further study but evince a concern with the links between <i>jus scripturae</i> (biblical law), <i>jus scriptum</i> (written law), and <i>jus humanum</i> (human law), connecting his study of Roman law with certain biblical and religious concerns. In the same year he also published, this time at Middleburg, <span class="italic">Ars Domandarum perturbationum ex solo Dei verbo quais transcripto constructa</span>, a theological treatise also dedicated to the earl of Cassillis.<br>
<br>The tide now turned once more against the Melvilles and their supporters, bringing further problems for Welwood and his family. In 1596 Black and Wallace were removed from their charge; in the aftermath of the resulting disturbances, Welwood's brother Andrew and brother-in-law Henry Smith were among the men in St Andrews who had to find caution for their good behaviour. In 1597 there was a royal visitation of St Andrews, the main object of which was to curb the authority of Andrew Melville. Welwood was removed from the chair in law which was suppressed. At almost the same time, the general assembly moved against Black, Wallace, and Melville, with a series of charges. Black in particular was charged with usurping the power of the civil magistrate in dealing with the blood feud between the Welwoods and the Arthurs. At this point the Welwoods once more found themselves under physical threat in St Andrews. William Welwood's brother-in-law James Smith was murdered in September 1597, the day before a meeting arranged to seek a settlement of the feud. There ensued difficult negotiations involving the kirk session, which evidently favoured the Arthurs, and the presbytery, which sympathized with the Welwoods. In this tense period Esther Welwood, William's sister, was shot at. The Welwoods eventually succeeded in securing the excommunication of some of the Arthurs and their relatives. By late 1599 pressure had succeeded in securing another arbitration and decreet-arbitral settling the disputes between the two families, although relationships clearly remained tense. Probably as part of the negotiated settlement, King James restored Welwood to the chair of law in St Salvator's College, but he had to sign a bond for his good behaviour. No more is heard of the blood feud.<br>
<br>In 1605 Welwood published in London an elementary work on Roman law dealing briefly with the topic <i>de verborum obligationibus</i> in Justinian's compilation. This was dedicated to Chancellor Seton as Welwood manoeuvred for supporters. The following year saw the beginning of a concerted attack on the presbyterians, involving treason trials, the deprivation and imprisonment of Andrew Melville, and the re-erection of a full diocesan episcopacy. By 1611 one of Welwood's earlier opponents was an archbishop of St Andrews, now with full powers to complement his position as chancellor of the university. Welwood's resignation from the chair of law was engineered that year and he departed for England. His years there are obscure. In 1613, in the hope of patronage, he published, with a dedication to the king, <span class="italic">An abridgement of all sea-lawes; gathered forth of all writings and monuments, which are to be found among any people or nations, upon the coasts of the great ocean and Mediterranean Sea</span>. This work contained an early attack on Grotius's <span class="italic">Mare liberum</span> of 1609. Patronage came, and Welwood was employed on behalf of Queen Anne to expand this attack into <span class="italic">De dominio maris, juribusque ad dominium praecipue spectantibus assertio brevis et methodica</span> (1616). This contributed to the considerable legal debate over freedom of the seas at this period; its reprinting in 1653 elicited a reply the same year from the Dutchman Dirk Graswinkel.<br>
<br>By 1619 Welwood was ill and seeking patronage from Lancelot Andrews, bishop of Winchester. He may have singled out this Arminian-leaning cleric, who was a member of both the Scottish and English privy councils, because his brother was currently involved in an international legal dispute over a ship attacked by the Dutch in 1618. Welwood's final work, <span class="italic">Dubiorum quae tam in foro poli quam in foro fori occurrere solent, brevis expeditio</span> (1622), appeared in London and was dedicated to Sir Julius Caesar and John Williams, bishop of Lincoln. Welwood obviously had some association with Caesar, a devout Calvinist, as the latter's papers contain an opinion by Welwood dated 7 May 1624 on the legal status of ambassadors. By mid-1630 Welwood was dead: on 4 June his son David was retoured as heir to his grandfather in lands in Fife and was settling other aspects of the family affairs.<br>
