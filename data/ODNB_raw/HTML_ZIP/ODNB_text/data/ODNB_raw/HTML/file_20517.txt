<span class="headword">O'Connor,  James Arthur</span>  (1792&#150;1841), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at 15 St Aston's Quay, Dublin. His father, William O'Connor (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1807), was a printseller and engraver, and is likely to have trained him in his profession. O'Connor did not pursue a career in that field himself, however, but quickly took to landscape painting, in which he may have received some direction from the Irish painter William Sadler (<i>c</i>.1782&#150;1839). He first exhibited in 1809, at the Dublin Society and the Society of Artists of Ireland. About 1812, he made the acquaintance of two young landscape painters, George Petrie and Francis Danby, and in 1813 these three friends made an expedition to London, where possibly all, and certainly Petrie, were presented to Benjamin West. Petrie soon left London for home, and a short time afterwards, O'Connor and Danby, having run out of money, followed his example, arriving on foot at Bristol, where Danby decided to stay, while O'Connor continued on to Dublin to care for his sisters, now orphaned. He exhibited regularly in Dublin and received some important commissions, including a series of sixteen paintings for the second marquess of Sligo and Lord Clanricarde. In 1818 O'Connor was also directly involved in the organization of the &#145;Exhibition of the artists of Ireland&#146;. During this period he married a woman called Anastatia Agnes. Despite his heightened profile and receipt of a premium of 25 guineas from the Royal Irish Institute, O'Connor returned to London in 1822, sensing that it would afford him greater opportunities. His name appears in the catalogue of the Royal Academy for the first time that year, and on sixteen subsequent occasions, up to 1840. He also exhibited with the Society of British Artists, of which he was elected a member. His contributions were always landscapes. In May 1826 he proceeded to Brussels in the company of a dealer, and remained until the following year. While there he is reputed to have painted several successful pictures, but the expedition proved unfortunate as he was swindled out of a sum of money, possibly by the dealer himself. He continued to exhibit at the British Institution, the Society of British Artists, and the Royal Academy, and visited Ireland in 1830 (and possibly in 1828). In September 1832 O'Connor and his wife went to Paris, where he continued painting, with some success, until the following May. They planned to visit Italy, but decided on the advice and offers of lucrative introductions of a stranger, who also proved to be a swindler, to travel instead to the region of the Saar and Moselle in Germany. O'Connor was so delighted with the landscape that he abandoned his Italian tour altogether and stayed there for six months, travelling extensively and painting throughout. He and Anastatia arrived back in London on 1 November 1833.<br>
<br>Over the next six years, O'Connor showed his work at the principal London exhibitions, but otherwise enjoyed at best moderate success. In 1839 his health began to decline, and his incapacitation led to considerable pecuniary difficulties, from which he was partly extricated by the generosity of Sir Charles Coote, who commissioned a picture and paid for it in advance. O'Connor was deeply appreciative of Coote's beneficence, and may have returned to Ireland before his death to paint a picture for him. He exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy for just the second time in 1840. O'Connor died at his home, 6 Marlborough Street, College Street, Brompton, on 7 January 1841, leaving his wife in financial straits. About fifty of his landscapes were sold at Christies on 12 February 1842, but none realized much money. According to his obituarist, O'Connor was &#145;a spirit of exceeding mildness; manly, ardent, unobtrusive, and sincere; generous in proclaiming contemporary merit, and unskilled and reluctant to put forth his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Monthly Magazine</span>, April 1842).<br>
<br>Though O'Connor was committed almost exclusively to landscape, there is considerable variety in his work which ranged from topographical pictures such as <span class="italic">View of Westport with Croagh Patrick</span> (1818; Westport House, co. Mayo), and <span class="italic">Westport House</span> (<i>c</i>.1818; priv. coll.), to picturesque rural scenes which demonstrate his knowledge of and debt to the work of Claude such as <span class="italic">Landscape with Mill</span> (1821; priv. coll.); <span class="italic">A River Scene, Co. Wicklow</span> (1828; priv. coll.), and the romantic landscapes of <span class="italic">Thunderstorm, the Frightened Wagoner</span> (1832) and <span class="italic">The Poachers</span> (1835) (both National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), all of which he executed with great facility and application.<br>
