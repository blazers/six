<span class="headword">Corlett,  John</span>  (1841&#150;1915), <span class="occ">sporting journalist</span>, was born at Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire, on 8 April 1841, the son of Sergeant-Major John Corlett of the 6th dragoon guards and his wife, Eleanor. According to his entry in <span class="italic">Who Was Who</span> he was educated by his father. At the age of sixteen he entered the wholesale grocery firm of Joseph Travers &amp; Son in the City of London and by the time he was twenty-one he had reached the headship of a department. He was already a horse-racing enthusiast and he began sending articles to the growing number of papers specializing in sport. These included the well established <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, which by the middle of the 1860s had been joined by <span class="italic">The Field</span>, <span class="italic">The Sportsman</span>, the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span>; it was with the last of these that Corlett became inextricably linked.<br>
<br>Corlett's big chance came in 1867, when he was given a job on <span class="italic">The Sportsman</span>. From then until 1874 he wrote under the <i>noms de plume</i> of Vigilant and The Wizard. His style was direct and vigorous but he was a master of the subject of horse-racing and this was what attracted readers. He was one of the earliest and most successful of the relatively new profession of sporting journalists who contributed to the growth of modern sport as an integral part of the popular culture of the British.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span> first appeared on 11 February 1865 as a weekly chronicle of racing, literature, and the theatre. Horse-racing was the hobby of its owner, Dr Joseph Henry Shorthouse (<i>d</i>. 1883), and Corlett bought it in 1874 for &pound;50. Its circulation at that time was probably in three figures but Corlett's energy and leadership gradually pushed it up to 20,000. He achieved this by promoting accuracy and good fellowship but also by affecting a flippant and bacchanalian outlook. The staff were presented as terrible dogs whose weekly copy was wrung out of them at the last minute over huge Fleet Street lunches. Racing authority, plain patriotism of the &#145;if you see a foreigner heave half a brick at him&#146; type, and a humour which has not travelled well down the racecourse of history attracted a readership of young and not so young men from club, mess, and smoking room. The paper became known as the <span class="italic">Pink 'un</span> probably as the result of an economy measure which led to its appearance on pink paper from April 1876. It was the <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span> which published the mock obituary notice for English cricket after the England team's defeat by the Australians at the Oval in August 1882, thus setting off the train of events which led to the legend of the Ashes. Corlett eventually sold the paper in 1912.<br>
<br>Corlett was a Conservative who lived mostly in rural Surrey and Kent, looking and living the part of a local squire and JP. He called Gladstone the &#145;grand old humbug&#146;. He was not greatly attracted to new ideas, did not like the gramophone, and refused to use the telephone in his Fleet Street office. He was happily married on 12 December 1868 to Mary, daughter of Charles Stebbing of Newmarket, and was devastated by her death in 1909. One son was killed in the South African War and a second was wounded in France in 1915. Corlett died of heart failure at his home, Park House, Walmer, Kent, on 23 June 1915. He was buried next to his wife at East Sutton, near Sutton Valence.<br>
