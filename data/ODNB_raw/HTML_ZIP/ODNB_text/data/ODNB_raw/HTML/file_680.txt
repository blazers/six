<span class="headword">Arnold, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1509&#150;1580), <span class="occ">lord justice of Ireland</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of John Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1545), administrator, of Churcham, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Isabel Hawkins. His younger brother Richard Arnold (<i>b</i>. in or before 1526, <i>d</i>. 1587), was a landowner and MP. John Arnold was protonotary and clerk of the crown in Wales, and in 1542 was granted the manors of Highnam and Over, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Nicholas Arnold was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 14 February 1524 and became one of Henry VIII's gentleman pensioners in 1526. On 19 June 1529 a marriage settlement was made between Arnold and Margaret, daughter of Sir William Denys of Dyrham, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Anne; they had two sons, one of whom was Roland Arnold, who married Mary, daughter of John Brydges, first Baron Chandos, and his wife, Elizabeth, and a daughter. After 1530 Thomas Cromwell employed Nicholas Arnold in connection with the dissolution of the monasteries. Arnold was rewarded with the priory of Llanthony in Monmouthshire, where he settled, before moving back to Gloucestershire. He was recommended for promotion into the royal household in 1538, becoming a member of the bodyguard of spears in 1539 and a gentleman pensioner in 1540. On 10 January 1545 Arnold was returned as one of the knights of the shire for Gloucestershire. In the same year he was in command of the garrison at Queenborough Castle and the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. His local consequence grew during the 1540s; he was JP for Monmouthshire in 1543, 1545, and 1579, for Gloucestershire from 1547 to 1554, <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Gloucestershire from 1558 or 1559 to 1580, and sat on various local commissions. He was also a member of the council in the marches of Wales from about 1551 to 1554 and from 1560 to 1580. Arnold succeeded his father on 12 September 1545.<br>
<br>In July 1546 Arnold was sent to take charge of Boulogneberg, a fort above Boulogne. He reported that the fort could not be defended but Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector, did something to improve the situation in 1547, and when on 1 May 1549, four months before declaring war, the French attacked Boulogneberg, they were completely defeated. Arnold had only 400 men against the French force of 3000. He was wounded, but the French are said to have filled fifteen wagons with their dead. A fresh attack was launched in August, when Arnold, recognizing that defence was hopeless, removed all the ordnance and stores into Boulogne, and dismantled the fort. Until Boulogne was returned to France in 1550 he remained there as a member of the town council. Arnold's knighthood probably dates from 1550. About this time he received an annuity of &pound;80 for his good service, and travelled to Italy during the latter part of Edward VI's reign. He returned to England in time to sit for Gloucestershire in Edward's last parliament (February&#150;March 1553).<br>
<br>Arnold did not openly oppose Mary's accession, despite his protestantism, but came under suspicion at the time of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger's rebellion. He attended the meeting of the conspirators in London on 26 November 1553 but opposed William Thomas's suggestion that Mary I be assassinated and was careful not to implicate Princess Elizabeth. On 21 February 1554 he was committed to the Fleet prison, and was sent to the Tower of London three days later. He was released on sureties for &pound;2000 on 18 January 1555. On 23 September he was even returned as knight of the shire for Gloucestershire, but he still maintained relations with various conspirators against Mary, and in January 1556 was implicated in Sir Henry Dudley's and Richard Uvedale's plot. On 19 April he was again sent to the Tower and his deposition was taken on 6 May. Arnold was sent to the Fleet again on 23 September, where he was allowed &#145;liberty of the house&#146;. Soon afterwards he was released on condition of not going within 10 miles of Gloucestershire, and even this restriction was relaxed on 3 February 1557.<br>
<br>On Elizabeth I's accession Arnold was restored to favour. He was sheriff of Gloucestershire from 1559 to 1560 and was one of the visitors who administered the oath of supremacy to the Welsh clergy. In 1562 he was chosen to go to Ireland to report on complaints against the administration of the lord lieutenant, Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex. James Anthony Froude regarded Arnold as &#145;a hard, iron, pitiless man&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and implacable in the face of blandishments. Richard Bagwell took a more moderate view; for him, Arnold was &#145;a man of resolution and industry, who cared little for popularity, and might be trusted to carry out his orders&#146;  (Bagwell, 2.50). Sussex resented Arnold's inquiry, especially into military mismanagement, and placed obstacles in his way. However, Arnold made too strong a case to be ignored by the English government, and in 1564 he was sent back to Ireland with Sir Thomas Wroth (1518&#150;1573) and a new commission.<br>
<br>Elizabeth accepted Sussex's resignation in April 1563, and on 24 May 1564 Arnold was appointed lord justice. It is unclear whether or not the decision to deny Arnold the post of lord deputy was motivated by his lack of sufficient distinction, or was a deliberate policy to downgrade the office of governor and to elevate the standing of the queen's loyal subjects in Ireland. He investigated military abuses energetically, but Sir William Fitzwilliam (1526&#150;1599), the vice-treasurer, and the most senior officers in the army refused to render accounts, as did other military captains. Arnold resorted to taking depositions from ordinary soldiers, which increased the resentment felt by the senior officers. In July, Wroth described him as &#145;not so friendly as he used to be&#146; and Fitzwilliam wrote several angry letters, accusing him of making an unwarranted attack on his character, using unseemly words towards Adam Loftus, archbishop of Armagh, and being extremely rude towards his colleagues on the Irish privy council  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 1.350). The loss of support of the army was a serious threat to Arnold's regime.<br>
<br>Arnold's response to his critics was to concentrate on the defence of the pale, relying on the general hosting to do so, to ignore the raids carried out by the midland septs or clans, and to give Shane O'Neill a free hand in Ulster. He believed that so long as the Irish fought each other they were little threat to English government. He wrote to Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, in January 1565, telling him that he regarded &#145;the wild Irish&#146; as like &#145;bears and banddogs when I see them fight, so that they fight earnestly indeed and tug each other well, I care not who have the worse&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/12/20). In February, Cecil cautioned him &#145;to stir no sleeping dogs in Ireland until a staff be provided to chasten them if they will bite&#146;, but Arnold did not heed his advice  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/12/50). Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, proved an ally, but the midland Irish saw their opportunity and attempted to overthrow the Leix-Offaly plantation. At Affane, co. Waterford, in early February 1565 the feud between Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, and Thomas Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond, erupted into pitched battle. Disturbingly, supporters on both sides included Old English lords and Gaelic chiefs. The queen was particularly affronted by the display of personal banners, an act of <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> that implied the participants had ceased to recognize royal authority. The dogs had not been asleep. Arnold encouraged Shane's attack on the Scots in Ulster, but trusted him too readily. It might have been sensible had Shane been content to confine his activities to that part of the country, but he reneged on the treaty negotiated by Arnold's envoy Sir Thomas Cusack and joined the O'Mores and the O'Connors in their attack on the Leix-Offaly plantation. In one year Sussex's achievements had been swept away and it seemed that the government might lose its last foothold in Ireland. Arnold's request to be appointed lord deputy was refused and on 22 June 1565 he was recalled and Sir Henry Sidney was selected to succeed Sussex.<br>
<br>On Arnold's return to England a series of articles was presented against him by Sussex but, apart from calling on him to reply, the privy council took no further steps against him. Thereafter he confined himself to local affairs. He was an active member of the four parliaments to which he was returned during Elizabeth's reign (Gloucester in 1559 and 1563, Cricklade, Wiltshire, in 1571, and Gloucestershire in 1572). He returned to England at least once during his Irish sojourn, since in February and March 1563 he took charge of four bills in the House of Commons and was named to a committee to consider a case of privilege (25 March). On 19 October 1566 the bill for Gloucester Hospital was committed to him and on 31 October he was named to the joint committee with the House of Lords on Elizabeth's marriage and the succession. Arnold owed his return for Cricklade to the Brydges family. He spoke on numerous subjects, was involved in a bill for the city of Bristol on 11 April 1571 and on a committee dealing with Bristol (12 April). It seems odd that he should have represented a constituency outside Gloucestershire on this occasion, but there were certainly factional disputes in the city and even the recorder, Richard Pate, was refused election. On 8 May 1572 Arnold was returned for Gloucestershire. He maintained his wide interests, speaking on the navy, Wales, the Storey privilege case, the vagabonds' bill, and the water supply of the city of Worcester. There is no reference to his speaking in the 1576 session but he served on nineteen committees, covering a wide range of subjects, including the fate of Mary, queen of Scots (12 May), fraudulent conveyances and recoveries, the poor law, and again on vagabonds. Arnold also devoted much time to improving the breed of English horses. As early as 1546 he was engaged in importing horses from Flanders, and in his &#145;Description of England&#146;, prefixed to Raphael Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> (1577), William Harrison wrote that, &#145;Sir Nicholas Arnold of late hath bred the best horses in England, and written of the manner of their production&#146;. The whereabouts of these writings are unknown.<br>
<br>Arnold made his will on 10 April 1580 and it was proved on 13 May. He granted generous legacies, especially to family and servants, and his most notable bequests were horses. He was buried in Churcham parish church, &#145;withowte any greate funerall/pompe and common dole to beggers&#146;, and an inquisition post mortem was conducted on 19 June 1581  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, sig. 17). His second wife was Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1580), daughter of John Isham of Braunston, Northamptonshire. They had one son, John Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1606), who was himself an MP and settled at Llanthony. Arnold also had at least one illegitimate son and daughter.<br>
