<span class="headword">Paul,  William Francis</span>  (1850&#150;1928), <span class="occ">grain importer and maltster</span>, was born on 11 February 1850 at 39 Bank Street, Ipswich, the youngest of the seven children of Robert Paul (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1864), maltster and wharfinger, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Woods, ironmonger, of Stowmarket. For several generations, the Pauls had been prominent members of the Independent church in Suffolk, and William's early years were shaped by his close involvement in the thriving chapel at Tacket Street. After a private education he joined his brother Robert (1844&#150;1909) in the small family firm, then administered by their father's trustees. In 1874 the brothers inherited the business and, under William's leadership, the partnership prospered. They acquired several local competitors and were soon numbered among Britain's leading maltsters; they became major importers of barley and maize; they built up their own fleet of steamships and barges and successfully diversified into the manufacture of animal feedstuffs. In 1893 R. and W. Paul was registered as a limited liability company with assets in excess of &pound;200,000.<br>
<br>Paul was uncompromising and hasty. Typically, he resolved a dispute over the repair of barges by purchasing his own shipyard. An opportunist, he was determined to remain at the forefront of progress. In 1899, accompanied by his son, Stuart, he undertook an extensive tour of the major grain-producing regions of America. They gained valuable trading links and firsthand knowledge of the latest developments in the handling and storage of grain. Three years later, Gillman and Spencer Limited, manufacturers of flaked maize and brewers' chemicals, was acquired, and their London wharf rebuilt as an American-style grain terminal. At Rotherhithe, the company also pioneered the production of animal feedstuffs from cooked, flaked maize. In Ipswich five large, modern maltings, designed by the brothers, were completed by 1912. A financial interest was taken in the Grantham maltsters Lee and Grinling, and further acquisitions (the Hull Malt Company in 1918, and the Cereals Company seven years later), laid the foundations of the twentieth-century enterprise.<br>
<br>William Paul's business acumen spilled over into other spheres. He began the family's deep involvement in farming, purchasing 1000 acres at Kirton, Suffolk. Active in civic life, Paul was a JP, a member of the Ipswich dock commission, the museum and library committee, and a trustee of Ipswich municipal charities. A staunch Liberal, he served as town councillor, 1890&#150;1908, alderman, 1909&#150;28, and mayor, 1900&#150;01. An accomplished speaker, he was said to dominate the council chamber. He preached the virtues of self-help but, maintaining a lifelong commitment to his nonconformist faith, worked tirelessly to improve the welfare of the town's citizens. For many years chairman of the public health committee, he instigated the town's tuberculosis sanatorium and public refuse system. As a memorial to his brother Robert, to whom he was deeply attached, he established the William Paul Housing Trust, which in 1914 built its first tenements for the poor and elderly. And in 1927 he created Bourne Park in one of the most densely populated districts of the town. For his work at the auxiliary hospital for wounded servicemen there, Broadwater, which he donated, and administered throughout the First World War, he was appointed OBE and awarded the order of St John.<br>
<br>Paul was married on 27 August 1874 to Jessie Eliza Mary (1853&#150;1887), daughter of James Springall, grocer, of Norwich; they had three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Bernard, a personable playboy, was banished to an estate in Argentina and never reconciled with his father. His two brothers, Hugh and Stuart, followed their father into the family business. Stuart extended his father's estates, ultimately farming 6000 acres and becoming a noted breeder of Suffolk horses and redpoll cattle. In 1889, William married Ida Florence Lankester (1866&#150;1965), of Stowmarket. The couple had one son, Cyril, and two daughters. Paul remained as managing director and chairman of R. and W. Paul until March 1927, when he resigned because of failing health. He died at his home, Orwell Lodge, Belstead Road, Ipswich, on 4 April 1928, following a heart attack, and was buried six days later at Ipswich borough cemetery.<br>
