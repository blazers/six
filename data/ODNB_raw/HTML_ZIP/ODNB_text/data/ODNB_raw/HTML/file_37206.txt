<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bomberg,  David Garshen</span>  (1890&#150;1957), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 18 Florence Street, Birmingham, on 5 December 1890, the fifth of the eleven children of Abraham Bomberg (1867/8&#150;1938), a Polish immigrant leather-worker, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Klan (1863/4&#150;1912), whose family kept an inn and reared horses. In 1895 the family moved to Whitechapel, London, and Bomberg attended Old Castle Street School, off Aldgate High Street. About 1906 he was apprenticed to the German immigrant lithographer Paul Fischer in Islington. But far more important to his future development as a painter were the evening classes at the Westminster School given by Walter Sickert, which he attended from 1908 to 1910. Then, fortified by a visit to Roger Fry's &#145;Manet and the post-impressionists&#146; exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, London (1910), where he saw C&eacute;zanne's work for the first time, Bomberg entered the Slade School of Fine Art in London with the help of a much-needed loan from the Jewish Education Aid Society.<br>
<br>During his time at the Slade (1911&#150;13), Bomberg proved himself a precocious and innovative student. One of an exceptional Slade generation, which included Mark Gertler, Paul Nash, William Roberts, Stanley Spencer, and Edward Wadsworth, he rapidly gained a reputation as a forceful member of the avant-garde. The artist and critic Percy Wyndham Lewis visited Bomberg at his Tenter Buildings studio in 1912, and in 1913 he travelled to Paris with the sculptor Jacob Epstein to select work for the Jewish section of an important exhibition &#145;Twentieth century art&#146; at the Whitechapel Art Gallery (1914). After leaving the Slade, Bomberg had a short and stormy affiliation with the Omega workshops of Roger Fry before exhibiting six works in the &#145;cubist room&#146; section of &#145;The Camden Town Group and others&#146; exhibition (December 1913), a major survey of the British avant-garde held at Brighton City Art Galleries.<br>
<br>But 1914 was the <i>annus mirabilis</i> of Bomberg's early career. Having exhibited five works as a founder member of the London Group, including a frenetic and impressively organized canvas called <span class="italic">In the Hold</span> (1913&#150;14; Tate collection), he asserted his independence from Wyndham Lewis's newly formed vorticist group [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64450/', "Vorticists")</script>]. Bomberg's first one-man show at the Chenil Gallery, Chelsea (July 1914), established him as a remarkably powerful cubo-futurist. In a youthful masterpiece entitled <span class="italic">The Mud Bath</span> (1914; Tate collection), he presented a vision of his local Whitechapel steam baths as a stark arena where harsh, clear-cut figures, an amalgam of human and machine forms, hurled themselves around and into the pool.<br>
<br>Bomberg shared the vorticists' involvement with the machine-age dynamism of modern urban life. In 1915 he exhibited six works in the &#145;invited to show&#146; non-members' section of the first vorticist exhibition, held at the Dor&eacute; Galleries in London. By November, however, he had enlisted in the Royal Engineers, from which he later transferred to the 18th King's Royal Rifles. In March 1916 Bomberg married Alice (<i>b</i>. 1880), daughter of John Burton Mayes, a London wholesale stationer, and divorced wife of Jack Richardson. Shortly afterwards he was sent to the front line in France.<br>
<br>Although the First World War prevented Bomberg from painting, he did receive an important commission in 1917 from the Canadian War Memorials Fund. The subject was <span class="italic">Sappers at Work</span> and the first version (1918; Tate collection) was rejected. The second, more representational version (1919; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa) was accepted. During the 1920s Bomberg underwent an irrevocable loss of faith in machine-age abstraction. He turned instead to a more traditional style rooted in his response to landscape. After journeying to Jerusalem in 1923 with funds provided by the Palestine Foundation Fund, he painted surprisingly naturalistic views of the city and countryside. Then, having returned to London in 1927 and left his wife, he held an exhibition of Palestine and Petra paintings at the Leicester Galleries (1928).<br>
<br>In 1929 Bomberg made his first trip to Spain, where the city of Toledo inspired him to achieve a greater breadth and expressiveness in his landscapes. He returned to London early in 1930, but only displayed his Spanish paintings in a 1932 one-man show at the Bloomsbury Gallery. These were the years when Bomberg's reputation faltered, and during his brief affiliation with the Communist Party he visited Russia in 1933. Lack of success then drove him back to Spain, where his best work was painted at Ronda in Andalusia. By the time Bomberg applied for a war artist's commission in 1939 he was a sadly neglected figure. After several rejections the War Artists' Advisory Committee grudgingly asked him to paint an underground bomb store near Burton upon Trent in 1942. It inspired some of his finest work, but the committee only accepted three bomb-store drawings. In 1941 he married the painter Lilian Mendelson (1898&#150;1983), divorced wife of Jacob Mendelson, an art dealer. She was the daughter of Oliver Oswald Holt, civil servant. They had one daughter, Diana, born in 1935.<br>
<br>Bomberg suffered continual rejection during the Second World War. The last one-man show he ever held in London was staged at the Leger Gallery (1943), and the only art school to accept him as a teacher was the Borough Polytechnic, London, where he taught part-time from 1945 to 1953. Although the classes were small, he became a legendary teacher. Among his students were Frank Auerbach, Dennis Creffield, Leon Kossoff, and Gustav Metzger, and the Borough period coincided with his most fruitful post-war painting expeditions: Cornwall in August 1947, and Cyprus in the summer of the following year. The heat and light of the Mediterranean inspired him to paint his most exuberant and expressive landscapes, but they remained largely unseen.<br>
<br>Bomberg returned to Ronda in 1954. There, after an abortive attempt to establish a school of painting at the Villa Paz, he executed his final landscapes and figure paintings. A new turbulence enters his freely handled work, and the <span class="italic">Last Self-Portrait</span> (1956) reveals the extent of his despair. In 1957 Bomberg became seriously ill and was moved to hospital in Gibraltar, and later to England. He died at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 19 August 1957.<br>
