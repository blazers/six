<span class="headword">Yevele,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was the most prolific and successful master mason active in late medieval England. The son of Roger and Marion Yevele, he first appears in the documentary record on 3 December 1353, when he purchased the freedom of London; by February 1356 his standing among the city's masons was such that he was chosen as one of a commission of six cutting masons who were to inform the mayor and aldermen about the acts and articles of the craft. The starting point of Yevele's long career as an architect in royal service may have been his partial remodelling or completion of the hall of the Black Prince's manor at Kennington on the Surrey bank of the Thames. This work was carried out under contract between March 1357 and September 1359 at the high cost of &pound;221 4<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. In 1359 Yevele obtained a licence to discharge victuals at Calais, a concession which suggests strongly that he enjoyed the patronage of someone highly favoured at court. Perhaps that patron was Sir John Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1360) who figures prominently among the beneficiaries of the perpetual chantry established under Yevele's will of 1400. On 23 June 1360 Yevele became &#145;disposer&#146; of the king's works of masonry in the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London, for which he received a fee of 1<i>s</i>. per day, together with an annual robe like those of the sergeants of the household. This office resembled its early fourteenth-century precursors, in that it did not prevent its holder from undertaking other work. Yevele's private practice eventually grew to enormous proportions, although its full extent has undoubtedly been obscured by the low survival rate of documentary evidence outside the king's works organization.<br>
<br>At Westminster Palace, Yevele was responsible for two essentially utilitarian buildings, the Jewel Tower in the Privy Palace (1365&#150;6) and the clock tower (now destroyed) which stood opposite the north door of Westminster Hall and regulated the sittings of the royal courts of justice there (1366&#150;7). At the Tower of London several minor works, including the vaulting of the thirteenth-century watergate, were performed by Henry's brother Robert. However, the real focus of activity in the king's works at this time was Windsor Castle, and it is telling that the master mason there, John Sponlee (<i>d</i>. 1382?), walked in the funeral procession of Queen Philippa in 1369 as an esquire of greater estate, whereas Yevele ranked only as a lesser esquire. During Edward III's reign Yevele's strictly architectural work for the crown was, with one minor exception, confined to London, but his duties impressing masons for royal service took him further afield and he supplied materials to numerous royal building sites in Kent and Surrey as well as in London.<br>
<br>In March 1378 the administration of the king's works was centralized under a clerk with responsibility for (in theory) all of England. Yevele was confirmed in the position he had held since 1360, but the records relating to individual works show that the geographical scope of his work for the king had expanded in proportion to the increased threat of invasion from France&#151;a reality reflected in the many references to him as king's chief mason with no distinction of place. He advised on repairs and new works at the castles of Southampton (1378&#150;9), Carisbrooke (1380&#150;85), Winchester (1390&#150;1400), Portchester (1384&#150;5), and on the town walls of Canterbury (1385&#150;6), but it is uncertain to what extent this involved him in major design work. In 1381, 1389, and 1393 Yevele's advice, but almost certainly not his services as a designer, were sought by the great building bishop of Winchester, William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404), who had been clerk of works at Windsor Castle from 1356 to 1361. On 29 August 1390 Yevele was made exempt from jury and other forms of service on account of his official duties and &#145;great age&#146;.<br>
<br>His advancing years were probably the reason for Yevele's association with the younger architect <a href="#cosubject_42245">Stephen Lote [<i>see below</i>]</a> in the 1395 contract for the tomb-chest of Richard II's monument in Westminster Abbey. Similar thinking would explain why in 1394, when he took charge of Richard II's greatest architectural project, Westminster Hall, his warden was Walter Walton, an established master mason in his own right. Internally, this most splendid of medieval halls owes much less to Yevele's masonry than to the work of his carpenter colleague, Hugh Herland, but the entrance front facing the outer court is treated with a monumentality unparalleled in medieval hall design. The ecclesiastical character of the front's twin towers, &#145;welcoming porch&#146;, and bands of enniched imagery, is perhaps less likely to have originated with Yevele than with Richard II, for whom artistic patronage was principally a means of asserting the sacral nature of his kingship. Formally, the design typifies Yevele's work as a whole in its great indebtedness to the version of Perpendicular Gothic pioneered by William Ramsey, his most distinguished fourteenth-century predecessor as king's chief mason.<br>
<br>Yevele's work for other lay patrons belonged to the 1370s and 1380s. For John of Gaunt he carried out in 1375 unspecified works at the Savoy Palace in London and, together with another mason, contracted for the duke's large and very sumptuous canopied tomb in St Paul's Cathedral. For John, third Lord Cobham he furnished the design (&#145;devyse&#146;) for a new south aisle at the London parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, although he did not take charge of its building. From 1368 he served as one of the two wardens of London Bridge, the city's chief public work, and though the wardenships were purely administrative, it is highly likely that he was the designer of the two-storeyed apsidal chapel of St Thomas which projected eastwards from the middle of the bridge and which was under construction between 1384 and 1397. The chapel possessed a &#145;table&#146; or handboard containing a summary history of the bridge, which was the source of the statement by the sixteenth-century antiquary John Leland that &#145;a mason beinge master of the bridge howse&#146;, built the chapel at his own expense  (<span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 5.6). This can only refer to Yevele, whose name presumably meant nothing to Leland. Minor benefactions by medieval master masons to the works on which they were engaged are occasionally recorded elsewhere, but donation of an entire building appears to be unparalleled in the European middle ages.<br>
<br>Assessment of Yevele's contributions to the most ambitious genres of medieval architecture, namely cathedral and monastic churches and their ancillary buildings, is hampered by the disappearance of documented works, and by the lack of written evidence for the authorship of extant buildings which can reasonably be attributed to him on the basis of stylistic and patronage evidence. The works in these categories include a large proportion of the outstanding architectural achievements of the late fourteenth century: the high altar screen of Durham Cathedral (1372&#150;80), shipped in boxes from London to Newcastle; the east and south walks of the cloister of St Albans Abbey (probably begun <i>c</i>.1380), destroyed except for the east processional door leading from the nave; the south transept fa&ccedil;ade of St Paul's Cathedral (1381&#150;8), also destroyed; and, most important of all, the nave and south cloister walk of Canterbury Cathedral (<i>c</i>.1382&#150;1400). At Westminster Abbey, some parts of the existing nave undoubtedly date from Yevele's time as master mason (1387&#150;1400), but the form of the bays had been fixed under the previous architect John Palterton. Opportunities for new design work were confined to the west front, which is notable for its &#145;welcoming porch&#146; and for its towers, the latter treated as vertically continuous sheets of decorative buttressing, gablets, and tracery. The only other surviving pieces of monastic building definitely by Yevele are architecturally modest: three cell entrances at the London Charterhouse, whose construction Yevele began in 1371, and a large, plain gatehouse built at St Albans Abbey some time between 1362 and 1381.<br>
<br>Yevele's involvement in tomb design was undoubtedly very extensive. Apart from the two royal monuments mentioned above, his only extant and documented work of this kind is the tomb-chest of the monument to Cardinal Simon Langham (<i>d</i>. 1376) in Westminster Abbey, in progress in 1394. Other major tombs whose stonework may be attributed to Yevele include those of the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral (begun late 1370s?), Archbishop Simon Sudbury in the same church (begun mid-1380s?), and Edward III in Westminster Abbey (after 1386). Yevele's will reveals that he was the proprietor of a workshop in St Paul's Churchyard which made monumental brasses. The products of this workshop may survive in considerable numbers, but their identification has never been attempted.<br>
<br>Yevele owned numerous city of London properties besides his own house, which stood on Bridge Street and faced the west front of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge. In 1387 he acquired an extensive holding in Southwark, which probably became his main residence after his second marriage. It included two watermills and a chapel. Earlier, in 1378, he had bought a small estate in the Thames-side parishes of Aveley and Wennington in Essex, no doubt principally for recreation, but probably also in part to acquire the prestige of being a landowner. His high standing in the city community is not in doubt. From <i>c</i>.1373 he was a member of the Salve Regina fraternity in St Magnus; in 1383 he was a common councillor for Bridge Ward; and in 1392 he was one of twenty-four &#145;more substantial&#146; citizens chosen to join the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen to plead the city's case in its dispute with Richard II. Yevele's will, proved on 25 August 1400, makes no mention of children from either of his two marriages, to Margaret, who was dead by 1387, and to Katherine, widow of John Hadde (known as Lightfoot), who lived until 1410. Yevele died on 21 August 1400 and was buried beside his first wife in the lady chapel of St Magnus. In the late sixteenth century his monument still bore an inscription recording his service to Edward III, Richard II, and Henry IV.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42245"></a><span class="headword">Stephen Lote</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1417/18), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, had a longstanding association with Yevele which may have begun in 1381, when Lote was warden at St Paul's Cathedral. In the mid-1390s he was co-contractor with Yevele for the architectural components of the tombs of Cardinal Langham and Richard II, but a more personal bond is suggested by his witnessing a charter at Yevele's estate at Wennington in 1398 and by his participation in the execution of Yevele's will. His appearance in the list of those given esquire's livery by the prior of Canterbury Cathedral priory in 1398, which also includes Yevele, is evidence that he oversaw the completion of the latter's work on the nave and cloister there. Although employed by Anne of Bohemia and other members of the royal family in the 1390s, Lote is not known to have worked on the king's buildings until after 6 October 1400, when he succeeded Yevele as master mason at Westminster and the Tower of London. His most important royal building was the sumptuous rebuilding of Shene Manor, Surrey, from 1414 (destroyed). Lote died during the winter of 1417&#150;18. His will of 31 October 1417 leaves his &#145;patrons&#146; (architectural designs) to Thomas Mapilton, who succeeded him as master mason both to the king and to Canterbury Cathedral. Like all other London-based architects active in the early fifteenth century, Lote and Mapilton adhered closely to the style of Henry Yevele.<br>
