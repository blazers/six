<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  George</span>  (1812&#150;1902), <span class="occ">historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, born on 23 November 1812 at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, was the third son of Abram Tyzack Rawlinson (1777&#150;1845), a landowner and racehorse breeder, and his wife, Eliza Eudocia Albinia (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of Henry Creswicke of Morton, Worcester. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23190/', "Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, first baronet")</script>, was his brother. Educated at Swansea grammar school and at Ealing School, he matriculated in 1834 at Trinity College, Oxford, as a commoner, and in 1838 took a first class in the final school of classics, graduating BA in that year and proceeding MA in 1841. He played for Oxford in the cricket match with Cambridge in 1836 and was president of the Oxford Union Society in 1840. He was elected fellow of Exeter College in 1840 and tutor in 1841. In 1841 and 1842 he was ordained deacon and priest, and gained the Denyer prize for a theological essay twice&#151;in 1842 and 1843. He vacated his fellowship and tutorship on his marriage (6 July 1846) to Louisa Wildman, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5220/', "Sir Robert Alexander Chermside")</script>. They had four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Rawlinson remained prominent in university affairs. He was one of the first moderators (1852&#150;4) in the newly organized intermediate examination of classical moderations and was an examiner in <i>literae humaniores</i> (Greats) in 1854, 1856, and 1867. He was interested in the relations between the university and the city, serving as a poor-law guardian from 1860 to 1863, and was a founder member of the Oxford Political Economy Club. He was particularly active on the committee of the Oxford Tutors' Association, which was revived in 1852 following the report of the royal commission on the university. Resisting the commissioners' proposals for strengthening the professoriate on German lines, the association defended the college system and tutorial teaching. On 20 December 1853, together with W. C. Lake, he put the views of the association to Gladstone in person, and thus had an important influence in shaping the <span class="roman">Oxford University Act</span> of 1854. Gladstone's interest in Rawlinson, with whom he frequently corresponded, was said to date from this interview.<br>
<br>During the 1850s Rawlinson prepared his best-known work, an English translation of <span class="italic">The History of Herodotus</span> (4 vols., 1858&#150;60), which was dedicated to Gladstone. The annotations, in which he was assisted by his brother and Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson, who produced important supplementary essays, drew upon advances in Egyptology and Assyriology. The work reached a third edition in 1875 and was reprinted in <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> (1910). At the same time he was the champion of a learned orthodoxy in theology. His Bampton lectures in 1859, published as <span class="italic">The Historical Evidences of the Truth of the Scripture Records Stated Anew</span> (1859; 2nd edn, 1860), which defended the scriptures against the findings of modern criticism, received a critical review by Rowland Williams (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, July 1860). He also contributed an article, &#145;On the genuineness and authenticity of the Pentateuch&#146;, to <span class="italic">Aids to Faith</span> (1861), the high-church counterblast to the liberal <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>. His orthodox churchmanship was a factor in his election by Oxford's largely clerical convocation to the Camden chair of ancient history in October 1861.<br>
<br>As professor Rawlinson was a prolific author of scholarly summaries of the results of research and archaeological excavations in the Middle East, which remained standard during his lifetime. His <span class="italic">Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World</span> (4 vols., 1862&#150;7; 2nd edn, 3 vols., 1871) surveyed what was then known of the histories of Chaldea, Assyria, Babylonia, Media, and Persia. It was followed by similar works on Parthia (1873), the Sassanid empire (1876), ancient Egypt (1881), and Phoenicia (1889). He used archaeological evidence to support orthodox scriptural interpretation, contributing the essay &#145;The alleged historical difficulties of the Old and New Testaments&#146; for the volume of <span class="italic">Modern Scepticism</span> (1871), produced by the Christian Evidence Society. As a biblical commentator and expositor he wrote on several <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> books for the <span class="roman">Speaker's Commentary</span> edited by F. C. Cook (1871&#150;88) and for the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> commentary edited by C. J. Ellicott (1884&#150;92).<br>
<br>In 1872, on Gladstone's recommendations, Rawlinson was made a canon of Canterbury, where he lived until his death, though he retained his Oxford chair (which carried, until 1882, the comparatively small stipend of &pound;140 a year). His connections with the university were much reduced and he played little part in the creation of a major school of ancient history at Oxford in the latter part of the century, which was largely the work of college tutors. Ironically, in view of his earlier advocacy of tutorial interests, he complained to the 1877 statutory commission that as professor he was virtually excluded from undergraduate teaching and examining. In 1885 no students attended his termly courses, and he stated that he regarded his main contribution to his discipline as writing books. For their part tutors circulated tales of his unwillingness to attract students; one story had it that after advertising a course of lectures outside the area in which undergraduates needed to study for their examinations, he would peer out from his window in the King's Arms Hotel, where he stayed on his rare visits to the university, to check that no auditors had come to hear his first lecture and then promptly leave the city until the start of the next term  (Jones, 190). He eventually resigned the Camden chair in 1889.<br>
<br>At Canterbury, also, Rawlinson's position was questioned, as canons were increasingly expected to assume diocesan and parochial duties. At the 1889 visitation he defended his academic role within the cathedral, listing the numerous theological books he had published during his tenure of the canonry, and pointed out that at the time of his appointment it was intended that he should devote his time to literary work. He suffered from an indistinctiveness of speech, which made him a poor preacher. In 1888 the cathedral chapter presented him to the wealthy living of All Hallows, Lombard Street; he later made valuable gifts to the cathedral. The last of his many published works was a life of his brother (1898). He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Turin and the American Philosophical Society. Rawlinson died at his home in the precincts, Canterbury, on 6 October 1902, his health having given way two years earlier. He was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford.<br>
