<span class="headword">Fogg,  Gordon Elliot <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">botanist and ecologist</span>, was born on 26 April 1919 at Langar, near Bingham, Nottinghamshire, the eldest of four children of Leslie Charles Fogg, Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Doris Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elliott. His early schooling was complicated by his father's frequent moves between circuits as a Methodist minister, from Northumberland to Lancashire and subsequently in a series of circuits in the London area. His boyhood hobbies ranged from chemical experiments to watercolour painting; an increasing interest in the living world (and particularly plants) was stimulated by frequent visits to his maternal grandparents' home in Nottinghamshire. He was also an active boy scout, and went camping on many occasions. When the family moved to London he won a London county council scholarship to Dulwich College, where his interest in biology was fostered, and on leaving school he went to Queen Mary College, University of London, as an exhibitioner and, later, scholar. He graduated with first-class honours in botany in the summer of 1939, planning to embark on research at Queen Mary College with the algologist F. E. Fritsch, professor of botany there.<br>
<br>With the Second World War impending Queen Mary College was evacuated to Cambridge. Fogg had registered as a conscientious objector, and was given that status on condition that he undertook research work. This he did at Cambridge under Fritsch's supervision, embarking on research into the so-called blue-green algae&#151;soon to be reassigned as bacteria rather than plants, under the designation of cyanobacteria. This group was to remain the focus of Fogg's research for much of his career&#151;organisms playing a major role as plankton in the world's oceans and in many freshwater bodies. In addition to contributing to the beginning of the food web for many marine and other aquatic organisms they share with a few other bacteria the capacity to take nitrogen gas from the air and convert it to ammonia and thence to protein. This &#145;nitrogen fixing&#146; capacity of cyanobacteria became a central feature of the subsequent research of Fogg and his students. In the later part of the war, from 1942 onwards, Fogg was directed by the Ministry of Supply to join a research team under V. J. Chapman (later to become a world renowned algologist, and professor of botany at the University of Auckland), together with two young colleagues, to conduct a survey of seaweeds of the western coast of Britain. Their research contributed later to the exploitation of the red seaweeds to make culture media for medical microbiology, but the brown seaweeds were used to make (among other things) a water-soluble parachute silk for the air-dropping of sea mines. Fogg was later to ponder his role in this, as a conscientious objector.<br>
<br>After completing his PhD on cyanobacteria Fogg went on in 1943 to work for Pest Control Ltd in Cambridge, where he met (Elizabeth) Beryl Llechid-Jones (<i>d</i>. 1997), who was working there on anti-malarial drugs. Two years younger than him, she was the daughter of Thomas Llechid-Jones, clergyman. They were married on 7 July 1945 in Colwyn Bay, Denbigh, her family home. They had a daughter, Helen, and a son, Timothy. Earlier in 1945 Fogg had been appointed an assistant lecturer in the botany department of University College, London, where he resumed his research on cyanobacteria, but also on other aspects of algal plankton ecology and physiology. He and his growing research group fitted well into the ecologically slanted department headed by W. H. Pearsall, and he was soon promoted to reader. This led, very appropriately, to his nickname of Gentle Reader, with a teasing reference both to his status and his personality. Fogg's work laid the foundation for the discovery that the specialized colourless cells in the cyanobacterial filament known as heterocysts were the site of nitrogen fixation&#151;a process that has enormous significance in the sustained cropping of rice as a global food source, for the rice obtains much of that vital element &#145;second hand&#146; from cyanobacteria. Using carbon-14 to &#145;label&#146; organic compounds, a technique he acquired while on a Rockefeller fellowship in Chicago, Fogg was able to demonstrate that marine micro-algae could leak up to 50 per cent of their products of photosynthesis back into the sea. This came to be recognized as a previously unsuspected feature of the global carbon cycle.<br>
<br>In 1960 Fogg was appointed to the chair of botany at Westfield College, London University. Now head of his own department, he appointed staff so as to cover the major fields of botany while also building up a group of specialists in cyanobacteria. The latter included Bill Stewart, who was later to become chief scientific adviser to the government. Much of the work of that group was summarized in <span class="italic">The Blue-Green Algae</span> (1973), by Fogg and others. In 1968 Fogg gave the Royal Society's Leeuwenhoek lecture, based on his cyanobacterial work.<br>
<br>Fogg's final move was in 1971 to take the chair of marine biology at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he remained until his retirement in 1985. While this brought his wife Beryl back home to Wales, and brought Fogg the chance of defending the importance of algal ecology within the field of marine biology, it also brought him a range of administrative problems that he had been largely spared in Westfield. These ranged from rivalries with colleagues in the Marine Science Laboratories in Menai Bridge on Anglesey, to conflict with the university administration over resources. He later gave a diplomatic version of some of these events in his memoir for the Royal Society of his colleague Dennis Crisp (1992). Despite these distractions Fogg continued the research on the extracellular products of marine algal plankton that he had started at Westfield, with a number of research students.<br>
<br>An important and separate phase of Fogg's life, which extended from his time in Westfield well into his retirement, was his enthusiastic commitment to Antarctic ecology and algology. His first visit was in 1966 while still at Westfield College, when he spent two months in the South Orkneys studying primary production and nitrogen fixation by marine algae in the Antarctic marine environment. Over the following years he made a number of other visits to Antarctica. When the British Antarctic Survey was placed under the control of the Natural Environment Research Council, Fogg was appointed to its Antarctic committee. He continued to visit Antarctica after his retirement, in the capacity of lecturer on cruise ships. He published three books on Antarctic science, the last of which, <span class="italic">The Biology of Polar Habitats</span> (1998), he dedicated to his late wife, who had accompanied him on his last voyage south. He was very proud that his son, Timothy, became involved in work in Antarctica in the late 1970s, with the British Antarctic Survey; the family name is commemorated in the name of the Fogg Highland at 72&deg;45' S, 60&deg;50' W.<br>
<br>Fogg played an active role in many societies and other bodies involved in his research fields. He was secretary, vice-president, and then president (1976&#150;7) of the Institute of Biology, president of the British Phycological Society (1961&#150;2) and of the International Phycological Society (1964), and a trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1983&#150;9), and of the British Museum (Natural History) (1976&#150;85). He was elected FRS in 1965 and appointed CBE in 1983.<br>
<br>Tony Fogg (as he was always known to friends and family) was an outstanding lecturer and a very approachable, calm, and diplomatic colleague. He was the scientist who more than any other elucidated the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by the cyanobacteria, and illuminated their role in the global ecosystem. He also made a unique contribution to the record of Antarctic exploration and ecology. He died shortly after suffering a stroke, at the Gwynedd Hospital, Bangor, on 30 January 2005. He was survived by his two children.<br>
