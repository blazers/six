<span class="headword">Hildesley,  Mark</span>  (1698&#150;1772), <span class="occ">bishop of Sodor and Man</span>, was born on 9 December 1698 at Murston rectory, Kent, the oldest surviving son of the Revd Mark Hildesley (<i>d</i>. 1726), rector of Murston and vicar of Sittingbourne from 1705, and his wife, Avis. In 1710 his father moved to the living of Houghton-cum-Whitton in Huntingdonshire and Mark was sent to Charterhouse School. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 29 March 1717; he graduated BA in 1720 and was elected fellow in 1723. In the latter year he was ordained, whereupon he was appointed chaplain to Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham; he graduated MA in 1724. Impressed by Hildesley's abilities Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, made him one of the twelve preachers at Whitehall in February 1725. Hildesley's hopes of leading the life of a don were shattered, however, when in 1726 his father died, leaving Hildesley's mother and five sisters without support.<br>
<br>Hildesley's search for preferment did not bear fruit until February 1731, when he accepted the college vicarage of Hitchin in Hertfordshire. In the same year he married Elizabeth Stoker (<i>d</i>. 1763). In his first twelve months at Hitchin, Hildesley buried 158 parishioners who had died of an outbreak of the plague, the average number of deaths in the parish per annum being usually less than thirty. Hildesley and his wife had only two children, Mark and Elizabeth, both of whom died in infancy, a blow from which the couple never really recovered. Hildesley's living was not rich and he was compelled to spend a great sum on renovating the vicarage. In order to recoup the money he took as boarders six gentlemen's sons. The boys caused Hildesley great embarrassment when George Whitefield came to preach in the town square; having gone into the belfry of the church they rang the bells so loudly that Whitefield's sermon could not be heard.<br>
<br>Hildesley, poor and childless, stayed in Hitchin for over thirty years. On 18 January 1734 he was made chaplain to Henry St John, first Viscount Bolingbroke, and on 10 May 1742 chaplain to Bolingbroke's brother John, second Viscount St John. He paid particular attention to the instruction of the young in his parish. In 1735 he was also given the neighbouring rectory of Holwell, in Bedfordshire; his kindness earned him the title Father Hildesley and he was much loved. In 1750 he was elected an honorary member of Spalding Gentlemen's Society, and on 20 February 1754 he was collated to the prebend of Marston St Lawrence, Northamptonshire. In 1755, at the age of fifty-six, he was recommended to James Murray, second duke of Atholl and sovereign lord of the Isle of Man, as successor to Thomas Wilson, bishop of Sodor and Man. Hildesley was created DD on 7 April by Thomas Herring, archbishop of Canterbury, and was consecrated bishop, by special licence, on 27 April 1755 in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall, by Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York, assisted by the bishops of Durham, Carlisle, and Chester. The following August he was installed in the island, in the cathedral of St German, Peel.<br>
<br>Wilson, Hildesley's predecessor, had died at the age of ninety-two and, though he had been an excellent bishop, his vigour had waned somewhat in his later years. Hildesley immediately set about reforming his diocese. He built a court house for the transaction of church business, began Sunday schools, enlarged churches, and established parish libraries. He insisted that sermons be preached in Manx to the local people and that the catechism in Manx be used every Sunday in all churches in the island. He himself learnt a little Manx and in church always gave the final blessing in the language. His chief achievement however was to publish religious works in Manx&#151;in particular the entire <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In this enterprise he was ably supported by a team of Manx-speaking clerics, most notably Philip Moore and John Kelly. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) gave financial assistance.<br>
<br>Under Hildesley's direction the four gospels and the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> were printed in London for the SPCK in 1763. The <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> followed in 1765. The second part of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> appeared in 1767, having been printed in Ramsey, Isle of Man, by the Whitehaven printers Sheperd. The first part of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> (<span class="roman">Genesis</span> to <span class="roman">Esther</span>) was printed by John Ware in Whitehaven in 1771 and again in 1772.<br>
<br>Hildesley continued to hold the rectory of Holwell <i>in commendam</i> until 1767, at which date he was presented to the mastership of Christ's Hospital at Sherburn, near Durham. The duties were slight and the income only &pound;500 a year but the money enabled him in these, the last years of his life, not only at last to provide for the widows and orphans of the Manx clergy but also to travel more frequently to England and so alleviate the isolation that he often felt in the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>On Saturday 28 November 1772 Hildesley had the pleasure of receiving the final proofs of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. This was the portion from <span class="roman">Job</span> to <span class="roman">Malachi</span>, including for some reason the two apocryphal books of the <span class="roman">Wisdom</span> and <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span>. The next day was Advent Sunday and the bishop preached in his own chapel &#145;On the uncertainty of human life&#146;. He suffered a stroke the following day and died at Bishop's Court, Peel, on 6 December 1772; he was buried in Kirk Michael on 10 December. Hildesley left &pound;300 of his meagre wealth to the SPCK to finance reprints of the Manx <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The final portion of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> appeared after Hildesley's death in 1773. The <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was reprinted in 1775 and in the same year a one-volume edition of the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> appeared for the first time.<br>
