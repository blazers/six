<span class="headword">Lumley,  Marmaduke</span>  (<em>c.</em>1390&#150;1450), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Carlisle</span>, was the fourth son of Ralph, first Baron Lumley, a major landowner in co. Durham and other northern shires, and Eleanor, sister of Ralph Neville, earl of Westmorland. Ordained in 1414, he was a bachelor of civil law by 1422, probably of Cambridge, where he was later chancellor of the university for at least two years (1425&#150;7) and master of Trinity Hall (1429&#150;43). Before his elevation he was a regular &#145;chopchurch&#146;, being presented to numerous livings, including prebends in Chichester Cathedral and in the Yorkshire secular colleges of Hemingbrough, Harden, and Osmotherley, and the archdeaconry of Northumberland, many of which he later exchanged. His powerful Neville relations and the patronage of Queen Catherine and Henry Beaufort, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1447), his uncle by marriage, must have assisted him to so much preferment. The latter probably secured the bishopric of Carlisle for Lumley in December 1429, in spite of opposition from the duke of Gloucester. He was consecrated on 16 April 1430. The promotion proved a mixed blessing as it confirmed Lumley's commitment to the interests of Beaufort in return for an impoverished and often war-ravaged diocese.<br>
<br>In 1431 Lumley's partisanship for Beaufort appears to have led to his eclipse, for his name disappears from among the personnel attending the king's council. He was nominated to attend the councils of Basel (1433) and Ferrara (1438) but, since the exchequer made no payments to him, he probably did not go; his activities from the mid-1430s to the 1440s seem to have been largely confined to his bishopric. His episcopal register has not survived so these have been reconstructed from other sources. He was a commissioner to regulate the keeping of the truce with the Scots in 1433 and 1434. On the latter occasion it proved impossible to secure a permanent peace and, following the expiry of the truce, the Scots besieged Roxburgh in August 1436. Lumley's role in organizing the raising of the siege may have persuaded the government that, unusually, a bishop would be a suitable warden for Carlisle and the west march. It may also have been attracted by his willingness to receive a reduced salary of &pound;1050 p.a. Perhaps too the royal council thought he would be easier to control from London than a lay magnate. Lumley took up office as warden on 12 December 1436. The earl of Salisbury and Lord Dacre certainly seem to have resented his appointment: the former was soon suing for the restoration of the post, and Dacre had to give a bond for 1000 marks in 1443 in the course of a dispute between himself and the bishop. Lumley's rivalry with Dacre also spilled over into the political life of Carlisle, as mayors favourable to one or other magnate alternated in office. Lumley's poverty led to great difficulties in the administration of his bishopric, and his estates were devalued by Scottish raids. He seems only to have been able to afford the services of one lawyer, Alexander Cok, and he relied principally on his relatives and servants to defend the march. In part his problems were due to the fact that his salary was neither fully nor regularly paid. Nevertheless, he completed his seven-year term.<br>
<br>As the power of Gloucester waned and that of the earl of Suffolk waxed, Lumley's political career at last revived. Late in 1446 he reappeared as a member of the king's council and was appointed treasurer of England on 18 December. He took effective steps to address the financial crisis he inherited. The increasing household expenses of the king and his educational foundations, along with the costs of the French war, coincided with a sharp fall in the yield from customs, the most important source of royal income. In 1447 he effectively put a stop on the exchequer by dismissing a number of customs collectors, so that the tallies they had issued to authorize payments from their revenues could be cancelled. He then controlled an orderly provision for the expenses of the royal households and partial repayment of the most pressing debts to holders of invalidated tallies. By 1448 his policies had been moderately successful and he also initiated a survey of outstanding debts and the effectiveness of revenue collection. However, the deteriorating military situation and plummeting customs receipts combined to provoke a financial catastrophe. Lumley continued to follow the model established by his predecessors, repaying long-outstanding debts instead of satisfying the urgent demands of the commanders and garrisons in France, as they came under increasing pressure in 1448 and 1449. When the military crisis was eventually recognized, royal credit was so bad that revenue could only be raised by loans, and in seriously inadequate amounts. In September 1449 he resigned the treasurership.<br>
<br>In the previous year Henry VI and Suffolk, who clearly wanted both to reward Lumley and to keep him close at hand, had proposed him for the see of London, contradicting their own earlier recommendation of Thomas Kemp. The pope refused to accept the change, and rebuked king and duke for their ineptitude. On 28 January 1450, however, Lumley was provided to the even more desirable see of Lincoln; the temporalities were restored on 14 March. His failure to defend Suffolk in that year, like his resignation as treasurer, may have been due less to timidity than to bodily infirmity&#151;his age (about sixty) was one of the reasons given by the pope for allowing him to appoint a deputy for a visitation of his diocese. He did, however, spend some time there between April and October 1450, but he returned to London early in November, perhaps for that month's session of parliament, and died in London on a day variously reported as 20 November and 5 December. No will survives, but he had made gifts of books to the London Charterhouse and Queens' College, Cambridge.<br>
