<span class="headword">Liston,  Robert</span>  (1794&#150;1847), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 28 October 1794 in the manse of Ecclesmachan, Linlithgowshire, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16769/', "Henry Liston (1771&#150;1836)")</script>, the minister of the parish, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of David Ireland, town clerk of Culross. His brother David became professor of oriental languages at the University of Edinburgh. Liston spent a short time at school in Abercorn, but was chiefly educated by his father. In 1808 he entered the University of Edinburgh, where he won a prize for Latin prose composition. In 1810 he became assistant to John Barclay (1758&#150;1826), a well-known extra-academical lecturer in anatomy and physiology. Liston continued with Barclay until 1815, eventually acting as his senior assistant and prosector. Barclay was an enthusiastic teacher, and from him Liston derived his love for anatomy. From 1814 to 1816 he became &#145;surgeon's clerk&#146; (house surgeon) at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, first to George Bell and afterwards to Dr Gillespie. He went to London in 1816, and worked under Sir William Blizard and Thomas Blizard at the London Hospital; he was also admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and began to attend John Abernethy's lectures at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He then returned to Edinburgh, where he taught anatomy with James Syme. In 1818 he was made FRCS (Edinburgh) with a thesis on strictures of the urethra.<br>
<br>Between 1818 and 1828 Liston gained a great reputation in Edinburgh as a teacher of anatomy and as an operating surgeon. However, he quarrelled constantly with the infirmary authorities, and this led to his expulsion from the Royal Infirmary in 1822. Nevertheless, in 1827 he was appointed one of the infirmary surgeons, apparently by the exercise of private influence, and in 1828 he was made the operating surgeon. Liston was married and had six children. A daughter married a son of William Dalrymple, surgeon, and his eldest surviving son became a colonel.<br>
<br>Liston failed to be elected professor of clinical surgery in 1833 in succession to James Russell; Syme, his younger rival and former colleague, was appointed instead, and this failure for Liston probably determined the rest of his career. In 1834 he came to London having been appointed surgeon to the newly founded North London (University College) Hospital. In 1835 he was appointed professor of clinical surgery at London University (University College). He was a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1840, and of the board of examiners in 1846. In May 1841 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Liston was remembered for his surgical skill and his profound knowledge of anatomy, which enabled him to operate successfully in cases from which other surgeons shrank. Mainly working at a time immediately before the introduction of anaesthetics, he attained a dexterity in the use of cutting instruments which has probably never been equalled. When anaesthetics were unknown it was of the utmost importance that surgical operations should be performed as quickly as possible. It was said of Liston that when he amputated the gleam of his knife was followed so instantaneously by the sound of sawing as to make the two actions appear almost simultaneous, and yet he perfected the method of amputating by flaps. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall and so strong that he could amputate through a thigh with only a single assistant, who held the limb. He could compress an artery with one hand while operating with the other. He excelled too in cutting for stone, and he devised a straight splint for treating dislocation of the thigh.<br>
<br>Liston wrote many pamphlets and case reports, and also <span class="italic">The Elements of Surgery</span> (1831&#150;2; 2nd edn, 1840) and <span class="italic">Practical Surgery</span> (1837). He was also the first man in England to perform an operation under ether vapour, at University College Hospital on Monday 21 December 1846. He posted a notice that the operation would take place and the theatre was filled with spectators. &#145;Gentlemen, time me&#146;, said Liston, and the successful amputation of the mid-thigh took twenty-five seconds  (Cock, 137). Stitching was done later. The frightened patient, who recovered, was Frederick Churchill, a Harley Street butler in his thirties, who on coming round asked when the operation was going to start.<br>
<br>Liston was not a good speaker. He was:<blockquote>a surgeon, nothing but a surgeon, having no interests, artistic, literary or scientific, except in connection with his profession; for he was in the habit of using his microscope with care and intelligence &hellip; a man exceedingly (one might say excessively) fond of all kinds of pleasure. (Bellot, 165&#150;6)</blockquote>He was popular with students, though many stories were told of his rough manners to his inferiors, his rudeness, and the retorts which followed. He was devoted to outdoor sports, especially yachting.Liston died of an aneurysm of the arch of the aorta on 7 December 1847, at his house, 5 Clifford Street, London; after a large funeral he was buried in Highgate cemetery. His eldest son, Robert, aged fourteen or fifteen, died at Duddingston House, Edinburgh, only twelve days after his father. After Liston's death a subscription raised &pound;700, not enough for the suggested marble statue, but enough for four busts and the Liston gold medal, which was still being awarded 150 years later. In 1850&#150;51 his widow was awarded a government pension of &pound;100.<br>
