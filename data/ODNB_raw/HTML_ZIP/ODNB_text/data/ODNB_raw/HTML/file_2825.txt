<span class="headword">Bond,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1612), <span class="occ">physician and classical scholar</span>, is of unknown parentage. He was associated for the greater part of his life with Taunton, Somerset. He may have been related to George Bond of Trull, 2 miles south of Taunton, who became lord mayor of London in 1588. However, as MP for Taunton in 1601 he described himself as &#145;a Devonshire man&#146;  (Townshend, 306). He was &#145;educated in grammaticals&#146; at Winchester College, and from there proceeded to New College, Oxford, in 1569, &#145;about the nineteenth year of his age&#146;. He gained the degree of BA on 4 February 1574, &#145;being either one of the clerks or chaplains of New coll. and much noted for his proficiency in academical learning&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.115). On 6 July 1579 he received the MA and later in the same year he took up the mastership of the grammar school at Taunton, a post which lay within the gift of the warden and fellows of New College.<br>
<br>For the next twenty-two years Bond was engaged in the Sisyphean labour of schoolteaching, as he characterizes it in the opening words of the preface to his edition of Horace's works: &#145;While I was undertaking the task of educating the young, a stone that I rolled for twenty years and more&#146;  (Horace, sig. A4<i>v</i>). But his efforts, however arduous, were crowned with considerable success, since &#145;he did exercise such an admirable way of teaching, that many departed thence so excellently well grounded in humane learning, that they proved afterwards eminent either in church or state&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.115). During his years as a schoolmaster Bond also took up the study of medicine, eventually becoming well known as a physician: &#145;at length being in a manner worn out with the drudgery of a school, he did for diversion, I cannot say profit, practise physic, tho' he had taken no degree in that faculty &hellip; and became at length eminent therein&#146;  (ibid.). When he entered parliament in 1601 it was as a physician rather than as a classical scholar that he was known to his fellow MPs.<br>
<br>Bond's first intervention in the House of Commons occurred during the debate on a bill designed to increase attendance at church on Sundays. He argued that the bill would place excessive power in the hands of JPs. By speaking of the &#145;luxuriant authority&#146; of JPs he caused grave offence to certain prominent members, including the puritan Sir Francis Hastings, MP for Bridgwater, Somerset, the promoter of the bill. Hastings accused him of making &#145;dangerous and seditious&#146; speeches, described his strictures on JPs as &#145;insolent&#146;, and demanded that he be called to the bar of the house  (Townshend, 277&#150;8). Bond apologized, but on the third reading of the bill again declared his opposition, calling it &#145;altogether needless&#146;  (ibid., 317). When the bill was defeated by a single vote Sir William Knollys, comptroller of the household, delivered the following rebuke: &#145;We have been often troubled by a Physician (meaning Mr. <i>Bond</i>) &hellip; He troubled us with <span class="italic">Aristotle</span> and other books; if he had stayed there, it had been well: &hellip; it is a most intolerable disorder&#146;  (ibid., 321). During the first parliament of James I's reign Bond proved to be an ardent advocate of union between England and Scotland. His last recorded intervention came on 2 May 1610, when his speech provoked &#145;much hissing and spitting&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1.423).<br>
<br>Bond left no writings on medicine. As a Latinist, however, he enjoyed a lasting reputation, based on his editions of Horace, first printed in 1606 and dedicated to Henry, prince of Wales, and of Persius, published posthumously in 1614. His notes, the fruit of his experience as a schoolmaster, are concise and to the point. For Horace much of his material is derived from the commentary of Lambinus, but Bond concentrates on the essentials, giving the sense of the passage where Horace's poetic expression is not immediately clear and explaining geographical, historical, and mythological references as briefly as possible. His edition very quickly gained the approval of writers on education. In the year of his death John Brinsley, the author of <span class="italic">Ludus literarius: or, The Grammar Schoole</span>, recommended &#145;M. Bonde upon Horace; who hath by his paines made that difficult Poet so easie, that a very childe which hath been well entred, and hath read the former Schoole Authors in any good manner may go thorough it with facilitie, except in very few places&#146;  (Brinsley, 122). Bond wrote the preface to his edition of Persius in 1610, but died before it could be published, and it was seen through the press by his son-in-law Roger Prowse, who was married to his daughter Elizabeth. Little is known about his wife, Anstice, who survived him. Wood states that his commentaries were used at free-schools and universities and frequently printed abroad. At least twenty separate editions of Bond's Horace were printed, fifteen of them outside Britain. The most eloquent tribute to his achievement as a scholar was paid by the Parisian publisher Nicolas-Louis Achaintre, who in 1806 produced a new edition of Horace with Bond's annotations. Achaintre's preface sets Bond above every other commentator on Horace.<br>
<br>In his will Bond stated that he had made provision for the construction of a hospital in Magdalene Lane, Taunton. His wife received his house in Taunton and most of his goods. He died on 2 August 1612 and was buried in the chancel of the church of St Mary Magdalene in the town.<br>
