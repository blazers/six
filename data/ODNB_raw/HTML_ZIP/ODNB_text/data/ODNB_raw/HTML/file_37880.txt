<span class="headword">Rambush,  Niels Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Niels Edvard Rambusch]</span>  (1889&#150;1957), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born on 25 March 1889 in Selde, Denmark, the eldest in the family of four sons and one daughter of Sigurd Harold Alfred Rambusch, medical practitioner and chief medical officer for northern Jutland, and his wife, Johanne Faartoft; both parents were sometime liberal members in the Danish parliament. He was sent away to school in Nyk&oslash;bing Mors, living with grandparents for seven years. On leaving school he decided against entering university, preferring to study the practical side of engineering through an apprenticeship to a master blacksmith in Nyk&oslash;bing Mors. At the age of fifteen he moved to Copenhagen to complete his practical engineering experience, and two years later he graduated as a mechanical engineer at the Copenhagen Technical College. Rambusch married Mavis, daughter of John Henry Blackmore, grocer, in 1911. They had two sons, the elder of whom died at the age of nineteen, and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1911, following six months' military service with the Danish infantry, Rambusch was invited to England by Arthur H. Lymn, who had formed a business in London to develop and exploit commercially the existing processes of gas production for industrial purposes. After a short period Lymn took Rambusch into partnership and formed the gas and chemical engineering firm of Lymn and Rambush. During his years in London, Rambusch expanded his knowledge of chemical processing, continuing his studies at Battersea Polytechnic under Professor J. W. Hinchley, who invited him to become a founding member of the Institution of Chemical Engineers in 1922. In 1930 Rambusch acquired British citizenship, having changed his name by deed poll to Rambush.<br>
<br>In 1918 Lymn and Rambush was taken over by the Power-Gas Corporation of Stockton-on-Tees. Rambush was appointed chief engineer and his boundless energy and leadership earned him rapid promotion with ever greater responsibilities. He was soon appointed chief engineer of the subsidiary company, Ashmore, Benson, Pease &amp; Co., manufacturers of gas holders and iron and steelworks plant. He became general manager of both companies in 1931, managing director in 1938, and in 1951 executive chairman of the Power-Gas Corporation Ltd, which by then had acquired all the assets of the subsidiary company. He continued as chairman until his death.<br>
<br>Rambush travelled widely in connection with company business and contributed many technical papers, which earned him an international reputation. His 500 page <span class="italic">Modern Gas Producers</span> (1923) was for many years the standard work on the gasification of solid fuels in a fixed bed with a mixed blast of air and steam. In 1931 Rambush was awarded the Moulton medal of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and in 1954 he became a vice-president of the institution. In 1948 he received an honorary DSc from the University of Durham. Rambush died on 15 May 1957 at Barton House, Stockton-on-Tees.<br>
