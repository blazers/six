<span class="headword">Hayford,  Denis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1733), <span class="occ">iron- and steelmaster</span>, whose exact parentage is not clear, was probably born at Ferrybridge in Yorkshire. However, he is known to have been the nephew and residuary legatee of William Hayford of Round Green, Silkstone (<i>d</i>. 1674). Both came from Ferrybridge, near the Aire River. Several members of the family, including William's father, Denis Hayford (who died about 1646), grandfather of the ironmaster, had been postmasters there. William Hayford became steward of Francis Rockley of Rockley and Worsborough, who had been left greatly impoverished by the steadfast support of his father, Robert Rockley (<i>d</i>. 1644), for Charles I. William Hayford conspired, together with his sister Margaret (wife of Thomas West), John Spencer, William Wilkinson, and others, to have his master outlawed and cast into gaol in 1659; there he ended his days twenty years later. Included in the estate was Rockley furnace, built in 1652 by the ironmaster Lionel Copley (<i>d</i>. 1675).<br>
<br>Although the terms of the lease allowed the lessor to cast 40 tons of iron at Rockley annually, there is no evidence of William Hayford's involvement in the iron trade. However, Denis Hayford was soon in partnership with William Simpson, who had taken the lease of Wortley forges in 1676. In 1678, soon after the death of the elder Lionel Copley, in partnership with Francis Barlow they took over the Copley interests in the iron industry, which, in addition to Rockley furnace, included the duke of Norfolk's works (Chapel furnace, Attercliffe and Wadsley forges, and Rotherham slitting mill). Hayford and Simpson also partnered William Cotton of Haigh Hall in running Bank furnace in conjunction with Knottingley forge.<br>
<br>In 1684, again in partnership with Cotton, Hayford acquired Lord Paget's works (Abbots Bromley and Cannock forges and Rugeley slitting mill) and, around the same time, the Cheshire ironworks (Lawton furnace, Warmingham forge, and Cranage forge and slitting mill). They could now supply rod and bar iron to Lancashire, north Wales, and the Birmingham markets in addition to the Sheffield area. Although the Paget works were disposed of in 1692, Hayford's marriage in 1689 to the heiress Gwyn Millington (<i>d</i>. 1730) of Millington consolidated his position in Cheshire. A new furnace at Vale Royal, which drew supplies of haematite ore from Furness, was built in 1696.<br>
<br>In 1698 Hayford withdrew some of his Cheshire capital, perhaps to finance his involvement in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Together with Barlow, Simpson, and John Fell (clerk of the duke of Norfolk's works), he acquired the former Sitwell works (Staveley and Foxbrook furnaces, Staveley and Carburton forges, and Renishaw slitting mill) together with Roche Abbey forge. About this time Hayford transferred his residence from Millington to Staveley and later to Romeley, in Clowne parish, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>It is as a pioneer of the steel industry on Tyneside through the &#145;Company in the North&#146;, in which Cotton, Simpson, and Fell were all involved, that Hayford deserves wider fame. About 1687 Hayford acquired Blackhall mill on the River Derwent, where he made steel by the cementation process. This move must have been prompted by the establishment in 1686 of the Hollow Sword Blade Company at Shotley Bridge, upstream from Blackhall. Ambrose Crowley (1658&#150;1713) had used the cementation method of steel manufacture at Stourbridge by 1682, with Swedish bar iron among his raw materials. By 1686 there was a cementation furnace at Abbots Bromley, which Hayford could have known, and the north-eastern location would have favoured his use of Swedish iron. However, local non-phosphoric ores were suitable for steel production and in 1692 Hayford acquired the lease of Allensford furnace and forge, further upstream from Shotley Bridge. This lease was not renewed in 1713, following around &pound;1000 worth of rebuilding work at Blackhall, and when the Swede Kalmeter visited Blackhall in 1719, a German, William Bertram, was operating the steel mill for Hayford. Bertram is reputed to have been shipwrecked on the coast about 1693, but this date so neatly coincides with the beginning of steel making in the area as to cast doubt on the tradition.<br>
<br>Blister steel, made by cementation, was converted into shear steel by welding and forging; &#145;Hayford steel&#146;, double shear steel, also known as Newcastle or German steel, was made by repeating this process. Double shear came in five qualities, though not all raw materials were capable of such refinement, and the Hollow Sword Blade Company continued to prefer Hayford steel even after the Crowley works was established at Winlaton in 1701.<br>
<br>In 1727 the aged Hayford's ironworking interests in the Sheffield area were taken over by his son Millington Hayford; another son, Denis, became a Newcastle merchant, but predeceased his father in 1732; a third son, Francis, became a London ironmonger. His daughter Ann was alive in 1732. Hayford himself died in 1733 and was buried at Rostherne, Cheshire, on 26 February of that year.<br>
