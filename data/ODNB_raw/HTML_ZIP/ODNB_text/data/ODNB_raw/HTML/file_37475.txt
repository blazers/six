<span class="headword">Gosse,  Philip Henry George</span>  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">general practitioner and writer on natural history</span>, was born at 29 Delamere Terrace, Paddington, London, on 13 August 1879, the only son and second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33481/', "Sir Edmund William Gosse (1849&#150;1928)")</script>, writer, and his wife, Ellen 
    (Nellie; 1850&#150;1929)
  , painter, daughter of George Napoleon Epps; Ellen Gosse's sister was married to Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64831/', "Sylvia Gosse")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64748/', "Sickert, Walter, pupils (act. 1890&#150;1939)")</script>] was his sister. Educated at Haileybury College (1892&#150;4), Gosse subsequently studied agriculture at Wellingore Hall, Lincolnshire (1894&#150;6). His chief early interest, inherited from his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11114/', "Philip Henry Gosse (1810&#150;1888)")</script>, was natural history; this led to a trip to Newfoundland in 1895. In 1896 he was appointed naturalist to the Fitzgerald expedition to the Andes, and on his return he contributed &#145;Notes on the natural history of the Aconcagua valley&#146; to E. A. Fitzgerald's <span class="italic">The Highest Andes</span> (1899).<br>
<br>Despite Gosse's passionate interest in natural history, his father insisted that he should have a recognized profession, and the choice eventually fell upon medicine. From 1899 he studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and qualified as MRCS and LRCP (1907); he attained the degree of MD (Durham) about 1910. After six months as a house surgeon at Essex County Hospital, Colchester, he set up as a country doctor in the New Forest, his amusing recollections of which appeared in <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Journal</span> (1933&#150;5).<br>
<br>Gosse's career was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914, in which he served as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In France until autumn 1917, he was then transferred to India until the armistice. His wartime recollections, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Camp-Follower</span>, were published in 1934, and were later reissued as <span class="italic">A Naturalist Goes to War</span> (1942).<br>
<br>After 1918 Gosse worked as a medical referee for the Ministry of Pensions, and later at the Radium Institute, eventually becoming its medical superintendent. He retired from medicine in 1930 and became a full-time writer, producing three biographies, a history of St Helena (1938), and a <span class="italic">History of Piracy</span> (1932); this earned him an international reputation, and was translated into French, Spanish, and Dutch. Yet Gosse's most enjoyable works are his elegantly written and witty books of recollections, which include <span class="italic">Go to the Country</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Traveller's Rest</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">An Apple a Day</span> (1948).<br>
<br>Gosse was an entertaining companion; his somewhat mordant manner hid an essentially kind personality, and he was especially fond of young company. His humour was sometimes expressed in schoolboyish practical jokes, but he possessed also a quicksilver wit, as illustrated by his remark to Lady (Margaret) Keynes (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Darwin), who told him she had been bitten by an ape at Gibraltar: &#145;He was having revenge on the Darwins.&#146;<br>
<br>Gosse's friends invariably forgave him for his wayward humour. He possessed a genius for friendship which is reflected in the many literary people who knew, liked, and respected him, from his cousin, Alec Waugh, and Vyvyan Holland, to Siegfried Sassoon (a distant relative) and the Sitwells. He was for many years Brother Buccaneer to the literary dining club, the Sette of Odd Volumes, where his repartee was much appreciated. From 1941 until 1959 he was a fellow commoner of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Gosse was married three times. On 14 July 1908 he married Gertrude Agnes Gosse Hay (<i>b</i>. 1872/3), an Australian cousin, the daughter of Alexander Hay, colonist and politician. They were divorced and on 28 November 1930 he married Irene Ruth Marden (<i>b</i>. 1897/8), a widow, daughter of Oliver Hawkshaw, gentleman of independent means. After another divorce he married, on 2 February 1943, Anna Gordon Keown (1896/7&#150;1957), poet and novelist. She was the daughter of Robert Keown, a London wool merchant. There was a daughter by each of the first two marriages. Gosse died of food poisoning in Brookfields Hospital, Cambridge, on 3 October 1959, and was cremated at Cambridge crematorium four days later.<br>
