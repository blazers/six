<span class="headword">Corbould,  Edward Henry</span>  (1815&#150;1905), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, born at 70 St John Street, Fitzroy Square, London, on 5 December 1815, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6301/', "Henry Corbould (1787&#150;1844)")</script>, painter and draughtsman, and his wife, a Miss Pickles of Chelsea, and a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6302/', "Richard Corbould (1757&#150;1831)")</script>, painter and illustrator. His brothers were Francis John Corbould (1819&#150;1884), a sculptor, and the twins Henry Heath and Alfred Hichens Corbould, born in 1821: one became a surgeon, and the other an artist. All four were educated at King's College School, London, where the younger brothers were taught drawing by John Sell Cotman.<br>
<br>Edward Corbould was taught by his father, and studied at Henry Sass's drawing school in Bloomsbury before entering the Royal Academy Schools in 1834. In that year his watercolour the <span class="italic">Fall of Phaeton</span> won a gold medal at the Society of Arts, but his prize entries in the following two years were models, a <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span> and a <span class="italic">Chariot Race from Homer</span>. His first exhibits in the Royal Academy, in 1835, also included a model, but thereafter he abandoned sculpture. However, in 1889, when the London corporation invited designs for sculpture for Blackfriars Bridge (a project never carried out), he produced drawings of colossal groups. With rare exceptions, such as the oil painting <span class="italic">The Canterbury Pilgrims</span> (exh. RA, 1874), he worked in watercolour, or claimed to. In fact, at least from 1851&#151;when he contributed one of the few paintings shown at the Great Exhibition&#151;he often used the &#145;new silica colour and a glass medium&#146; invented ten years previously by Thomas Miller of Long Acre.<br>
<br>Corbould also exhibited at the New Watercolour Society, later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, from 1837, being elected a member in that year. In 1861 he resigned over financial mismanagement, but returned after failing to win election to the Old Watercolour Society. He finally retired from active membership in 1898, having exhibited about 250 works. Corbould's highly wrought exhibition pieces&#151;sometimes harsh in colour and rigid in composition&#151;were very obviously intended to face down oil paintings on their own terms; numerous prints of his works were published. His sketches owe something to the works of the German Nazarene school, employing strong pen outlines and light colour washes. Corbould was also a prolific book and magazine illustrator, working on many standard nineteenth-century editions of authors such as Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, and Walter Scott. Many of his illustrations were mere hackwork, and the historian of 1860s illustration Gleeson White dismissed the work of Corbould and other contributors to the 1870 volume of <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span> with the remark that it would be kindest to ignore it.<br>
<br>In 1840 Corbould drew the portrait of the queen for the new penny black stamp, from Wyon's medal, and he also designed stamps for Trinidad, Mauritius, Ceylon, and Van Diemen's Land. In 1842 his <span class="italic">The Woman Taken in Adultery</span> was bought by the prince consort, who subsequently presented a number of his works to the queen, and in 1851 he was appointed &#145;instructor of historical painting to the royal family&#146;. For the next twenty-one years he taught various members of the family, and many of his best works were acquired by them. His duties could be time-consuming: in 1862 he wrote to J. J. Jenkins from Osborne:<blockquote>Here I am a prisoner but I hope to get up to town on Saturday night. The Princess Alice has made me promise to &#145;stay over Saturday&#146;. Surely HRH never understands that I am to be visible here on the Monday? I shall only understand <i>till</i> Saturday evening. (Royal Watercolour Society archives)</blockquote>Corbould was married three times: his first marriage on 28 September 1839 to Fanny Jemima (<i>d</i>. 1850), daughter of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12831/', "Charles Heath (1785&#150;1848)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65036/', "Heath family")</script>], produced three daughters. The eldest, Jemima, married the painter Francis John Wyburd (1827&#150;1909), and the second, Isabel Fanny, Mrs G. H. Heywood, had two artist daughters. His second marriage, to Annie Middleton Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1866), took place on 7 August 1851; the couple had two sons, Ridley Edward Arthur Lamothe (1854&#150;1887) and Victor Albert Louis Edward (<i>b</i>. 1866), who became a doctor. He married thirdly, on 15 January 1868, Anne Melis Sanders, daughter of Ellis Lee Sanders, with whom he had a further son and daughter.<br>
<br>Between 1851 and 1853 Corbould's brother Alfred built Eldon Lodge, at 8 Victoria Road, in the new suburb of South Kensington, but Edward was then by far the more prosperous of the two and in the 1860s he took over the property. He extended it, creating a worthy neighbour for Leighton House and its artistic fellows on Campden Hill: Corbould's studio measured 26 feet by nearly 25 feet, was proportionately high, and panelled with English and continental oak carving dating from the middle ages to the Gothic revival. Below was an equally sizeable picture store. While the hall was tiled in the manner of Pugin, the dining-room was in the Adam style, and the study was fashionably japanesque.<br>
<br>After the death of Prince Albert, the queen employed Corbould to colour photographs of him; he was responsible for the image of Albert the Good in knightly armour receiving his crown of glory, which hung as a memorial in the Albert Room at Windsor Castle. However, by the mid-1870s Corbould's historical paintings were out of fashion. On 6 May 1875 the queen noted in her journal that she &#145;thought him much aged and altered&#146;  (Royal Archives, Windsor), and thereafter she not only paid &pound;50 p.a. towards his son's school fees, but from 1891 a personal allowance, continued by Edward VII. He died at Eldon Lodge on 16 January 1905. As well as the watercolours and albums in the Royal Collection, there are examples of his work in the British Museum and the Sydney Art Gallery.<br>
