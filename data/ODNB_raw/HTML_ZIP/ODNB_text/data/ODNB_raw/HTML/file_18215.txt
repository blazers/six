<span class="headword">Martin,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1696&#150;1756), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, appears to have been the eldest son of Tutchen Martin (<i>d</i>. 1702) of Stepney and his wife, Bennet Garsh, or Gage, although another account states that his father was Commodore George Martin (<i>d</i>. 1724). Confusion also exists as to his early service, but he seems to have entered the navy as a volunteer per order, or king's letter boy, on 26 August 1708 on the <i>Dragon</i>. When the <i>Dragon</i> went to Newfoundland in May 1710 Martin was put on shore at Plymouth &#145;for his health&#146;. He appears to have taken passage to the Mediterranean in the <i>Ranelagh</i> almost immediately, for on 30 July 1710 he was promoted second lieutenant of the <i>Resolution</i> by Sir John Norris. On 4 January 1712 he was appointed by Sir John Jennings, also in the Mediterranean, to the <i>Superbe</i>, in which he continued until July 1714. Between 1715 and 1718 he transferred from the <i>Cumberland</i>, flagship of Sir John Norris in the Baltic, to the <i>Rupert</i>; and to the <i>Cumberland</i>, again with Norris. On 9 October 1718 he was promoted captain in the <i>Cumberland</i>, and took post from that date. On 9 February 1720 he was appointed to the <i>Blandford</i>, which between 1720 and 1721 was attached to the Baltic fleet under Norris, and was afterwards employed in American waters in the suppression of piracy. On 16 August 1726 he married Mary Atkins of Twell, Gloucestershire; they had no children.<br>
<br>From 1727 to 1732 Martin commanded the <i>Advice</i> in the fleet supporting Gibraltar and then in the channel, under Sir Charles Wager; and later the <i>Sunderland</i> on the home station, at Lisbon, or in the Mediterranean (1733&#150;7). In May 1738 he was appointed to the <i>Ipswich</i>, one of the fleet in the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral Nicholas Haddock. In January 1741 he hoisted a broad pennant in command of a detached squadron off Cadiz, and in July 1742 was sent by Admiral Thomas Mathews to enforce the neutrality of Naples. With three ships of the line, two frigates, and four bomb-vessels he sailed into Naples Bay on the afternoon of 9 August, and sending his flag captain Merrick De Langle, on shore, requested an immediate and categorical answer to his demands. The Neapolitans attempted to make conditions, and De Langle returned to the ship with their deputy. Martin replied that he was sent &#145;as an officer to act, not a minister to treat&#146;, and desired De Langle to insist on a prompt answer. Martin's force was small, but superior to any the Neapolitans could raise against it, and they yielded to the pressure put on them.<br>
<br>Martin was subsequently employed in protecting Tuscany from any attempt on the part of the Spaniards, and in February 1743 was sent to Genoa to require the destruction of Spanish magazines. He was later involved in the sinking of a Spanish ship of the line, the <i>San Isidro</i> at Ajaccio.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the year Martin returned to England, and on 7 December he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral. In February 1744 he commanded in the Channel Fleet under Sir John Norris, and on 19 June 1744 he was advanced to vice-admiral, and was second in command in the fleet which went to Lisbon under Sir John Balchen. Balchen during this period asked Martin to report on the state of the contract hospitals; the report was so critical that it strongly influenced the decision to establish medical centres solely for the navy. On Balchen's death Martin was appointed to the chief command, which he held during 1745. In December he and his squadron were sent to the Downs under Admiral Edward Vernon, and on Vernon's dismissal he succeeded to the command. Following the collapse of the Jacobite threat he took the squadron back to its usual station, and commanded the principal fleet, until in July 1746 he sought and was granted leave to retire for health reasons. He had served almost continuously since 1738, and had already warned the Admiralty that he needed a respite.<br>
<br>During this command Martin conducted his squadron diligently and carefully. However, owing to the lack of a settled policy, the Admiralty's practice of reacting to any information received by ordering the squadron hither and thither to meet the need, and its necessary visits to port to replenish its provisions, a number of French squadrons was able to make their departure. No blame for the escapes was laid on him, and the ample notice he gave of his wish to retire seems to dispel the suggestion that he was piqued by George Anson's assumption of the command, although he might have been irked by public criticism. On 15 July 1747 he was promoted admiral of the blue. Charnock described him as a handsome and learned man who spoke several languages with ease, and who, when in command, was said to live in &#145;the greatest splendour, maintaining his rank in the highest style&#146;  (J. Charnock, <span class="italic">Biographia navalis</span>, 6 vols., 1794&#150;8, 4.69). He retired to Twickenham where he died on 17 September 1756 &#145;being about sixty years old&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
