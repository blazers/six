<span class="headword">Gay,  Noel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Reginald Moxon Armitage]</span>  (1898&#150;1954), <span class="occ">composer and lyricist</span>, was born on 15 July 1898 at Park Terrace, Leeds Road, Outwood, Wakefield, the son of Harry Armitage, a colliery clerk, and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth Moxon. Musically precocious, he won a scholarship to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, at the age of eight and subsequently often deputized for the choirmaster at Wakefield Cathedral. His original ambition was to obtain a choral appointment in a cathedral, but at the age of fifteen, in 1913, he took up a scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London, where he studied with Sir Frederick Bridge and Walter Parratt. By the time he was eighteen he was already director of music and resident organist at St Anne's Church in Soho.<br>
<br>Armitage then went up to Christ's College, Cambridge, to study composition, again with a view to joining a cathedral, and graduated four years later with an MA and a BMus. At Cambridge, however, his interests had begun to turn more secular, specifically towards the world of undergraduate revues, to which he contributed many popular songs in the chirpy, colloquial style which became his hallmark.<br>
<br>After coming down from Cambridge, Armitage began to contribute songs to such mid-1920s West End revues as <span class="italic">Stop Press</span> with such success that the impresario Andr&eacute; Charlot invited him to write all the words and music for his 1926 revue. He took his <i>nom de plume</i>&#151;Noel Gay&#151;from a sign he read on a London bus in 1924: &#145;NOEL Coward and Maisie GAY in a new revue&#146;. He also began writing for the successful husband-and-wife musical comedy team of Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge. On 26 April 1927 Armitage married Amy Marshall, daughter of Walter Marshall, a liquorice refiner.<br>
<br>Altogether, Gay wrote the music for twenty-six London shows, twenty-eight feature films, and forty-five songs, one of which, &#145;Tondeleyo&#146;, was the first ever to be used in a British talking picture. His song hits included &#145;The Lambeth walk&#146;, &#145;Run rabbit run&#146;, &#145;There's something about a soldier&#146;, and &#145;Let the people sing&#146;, all of which bear the distinctive features of his work: an absolute simplicity of lyrical thought, the refusal to use a polysyllabic word if a monosyllable would do (&#145;Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run&#146;), and the gift of a cheery melodic line which implanted itself almost involuntarily in the memory of its audiences (to that extent he was the closest Britain ever came to a local Irving Berlin).<br>
<br>Like such near-contemporaries as No&euml;l Coward and Ira Gershwin, Gay combined a solid classical musical training with a passion for Gilbert and Sullivan and an ability to write readily accessible songs with catchy lyrics. He later provided the music for such hit musical comedies as <span class="italic">Clowns in Clover</span> (1927), by Ronald Jeans, <span class="italic">Hold my Hand</span> (1931), by Stanley Lupino, <span class="italic">She Couldn't Say No</span> (1932), <span class="italic">That's a Pretty Thing</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Love Laughs</span> (1935). The most remarkable of all was <span class="italic">Me and My Girl</span>, written by L. Arthur Rose and Douglas Furber, which included Gay's celebrated &#145;Lambeth walk&#146; number.<br>
<br>Gay afterwards described how he deliberately employed &#145;everyday homely symbols, with simple repetitions, or otherwise new angles on old situations&#146;  (McKibbin, 407). The central figure, Bill Snibson, a cockney who inherits an earldom but still lives as a cockney, was played by Lupino Lane. He organizes a grand party, attended by &#145;toffs&#146; as well as old friends. However, when Snibson begins to sing &#145;The Lambeth walk&#146; the social classes intermingle: &#145;there is a terrific effect of social breakdown, everyone joins in and shouts &#147;Oi!&#148; and the Duchess finally goes into dinner on Bill's arm, wearing his bowler on her head&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The musical first opened in 1937 at the Victoria Palace, London. It was by no means an overnight success, but it was broadcast on radio by the BBC on 13 January 1938, live from the theatre, and this helped turn its fortunes around. Despite being bombed out of two different theatres, the show ran for five more years as the greatest of all Second World War London hits. A revival of <span class="italic">Me and My Girl</span> in 1985, with its book revised by Stephen Fry, ran for more than seven years and made stars of Emma Thompson and Robert Lindsay on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>Gay continued to write through the rest of the war and into the 1950s, but his later songs never lived up to the success of those in <span class="italic">Me and My Girl</span>&#151;arguably the most successful London musical of the mid-twentieth century. The 1985 revival incorporated such other hit songs of Gay's as &#145;The sun has got his hat on&#146;, &#145;Love makes the world go round&#146;, and &#145;I'm leaning on a lamp post&#146;, the old George Formby hit. Among other leading performers for whom Gay wrote hit songs were Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale, the Crazy Gang, and Gracie Fields. But he had been going prematurely deaf for several years, and in the early 1950s his writing slowed down; the fashion for his especial kind of cheery London cockney song was also now on the wane. His last score was for the pantomime <span class="italic">Aladdin</span> at Richmond in 1949&#150;50, and he died from cancer at his London home, 48 Portland Place, on 4 March 1954, aged only fifty-five.<br>
<br>A successful businessman, Gay established the Noel Gay Agency; run by his son Richard Armitage, this became one of the leading British and European musical and talent agencies. While one of his grandsons, Alex Armitage, masterminded the revival of <span class="italic">Me and My Girl</span>, another, Charles Armitage, looked after the equally successful music-publishing division of the agency.<br>
<br>Gay never achieved the musical fame of such West End contemporaries as No&euml;l Coward, Ivor Novello, or Vivian Ellis, but he rivalled them in terms of the colloquial, populist, and streetwise tenor of his songs.<br>
