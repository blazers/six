<span class="headword">Keyl,  Frederick William <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Friedrich Wilhelm]</span></span>  (1823&#150;1871), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born at Frankfurt am Main on 17 September 1823, son of a wine merchant, Friedrich Wilhelm Christian Keyl (<i>c</i>.1778&#150;1869), and his wife, Henrietta Steinh&auml;user (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1791). He grew up with a love of hunting and wildlife, which was later reflected in his art. He studied at the St&auml;delsches Kunstinstitut at Frankfurt, under Jacob Becker. In May 1846 Keyl left Frankfurt to spend three months in England, before visiting Brussels where he carried out some commissions, studied with the landscape and animal painter Eug&egrave;ne Verboeckhoven, and met Thomas Jones and Louis Gallait. In April 1847 Keyl returned to England, where he spent the rest of his life; he was naturalized in March 1858.<br>
<br>At the Royal Academy in 1847 Keyl exhibited <span class="italic">Fidelity</span> (probably painted in Brussels) and, up to 1872, he showed forty-two pictures there, and, from 1850, thirty-four works at the British Institution. Keyl carried out commissions for patrons around the country, including such groups as <span class="italic">Edward and Dora Studd at Tedworth</span> (1861; ex Sothebys, 18 November 1992), but he seems to have been of a sensitive and nervous disposition, and averse to exhibiting his pictures. In the 1860s he was deeply upset when some of his paintings were rejected by the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Keyl became the only pupil of Edwin Landseer, and through his introduction the German artist was received at Buckingham Palace, armed with a portfolio of animal studies which the queen liked. Landseer was delighted that some of the royal commissions for animal paintings could be carried out by Keyl: from 1847 the younger artist painted twenty-six oils for Queen Victoria (fifteen of which remain in the Royal Collection) and fifty-four watercolours and sketches. He was also employed to paint photographs, for instance, of the Sardinian ponies given to the queen by King Victor Emmanuel in 1855. His most prestigious commission was to paint Lootie, the Pekinese lion dog, but he also portrayed many other dogs, cows, and the queen's highland pony, Brechin. Despite the extensive patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Keyl received no wide recognition and few of his oils or watercolours are in public galleries. He also undertook book illustrations, drawings of animals for wood-engravings, plates for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and illustrations for the cover of the magazine <span class="italic">Chatterbox</span>.<br>
<br>Keyl's many friends in London included Francis Grant, Thomas Landseer, Ernst August Becker, and Prince Albert's riding-master, Wilhelm Meister. He taught drawing to Sara Constance Woodin (1830&#150;1892), a niece of C. R. Leslie, whom he married on 25 August 1852 and with whom he had nine children, three of whom died in infancy. The family lived in St John's Wood. Keyl was paid 3 guineas a day for his work for the queen, but was, for some years in England, still financially dependent on his father. In 1865, apparently on the verge of a breakdown, the artist stayed at Reigate with his friend and patron James Nicolson. On 5 December 1871, at his home at 67 Carlton Hill, St John's Wood, Keyl died of congestion of the lungs, probably consumption, from which he had suffered all his life; his niece wrote from Frankfurt to her cousin, &#145;He deserves to rest for his whole life consisted of work, toil, and sacrifice from love for his family&#146;  (Weber, 109). He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
