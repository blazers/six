<span class="headword">Manners, Lord  Robert</span>  (1758&#150;1782), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 6 February 1758, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17958/', "John Manners, marquess of Granby (1721&#150;1770)")</script>, army officer, and Lady Frances Seymour (1728&#150;1761), daughter of the sixth duke of Somerset and his second wife. Robert Manners, whose paternal grandfather was John, third duke of Rutland, was educated at Eton College (1763&#150;71) before entering the navy. An ambitious young man from one of England's most prominent families, he expected his promotion in the navy to be inevitable and swift. This posed problems for the lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sandwich, who was criticized for resisting Manners's promotion to lieutenant until he had served the regulation six years. Manners was finally promoted to this rank on 13 May 1778 in the <i>Ocean</i> in which he was present in the action off Ushant on 27 July. On 17 September he was moved to the <i>Victory</i>, flagship of Admiral Augustus Keppel, and on 15 July 1779 into the <i>Alcide</i>, one of the ships that went out to Gibraltar with Admiral George Rodney and defeated the Spanish squadron off Cape St Vincent.<br>
<br>Soon after his promotion to lieutenant Manners made clear his desire for further advancement. Sandwich again resisted, and was reminded by his colleague Lord Mansfield how &#145;He [Manners] &amp; the whole family will feel it as a personal injury&#146; if these ambitions were not realized. Sandwich was aware that the issue could bring renewed attacks on him and on Lord North's government. On 8 December 1779 he wrote to Admiral Rodney concerning Manners:<blockquote>There is another young man of fashion now in your squadron concerning whom I am tormented to death. I cannot do anything for him at home; therefore, if you could contrive while he remains with you, by some means or other, to give him rank, you will infinitely oblige me. (Mundy, 1.207)</blockquote>Rodney, who had fewer qualms about promoting Manners, took the first opportunity (17 January 1780) to advance him to captain of the <i>Resolution</i>, under Sir Challoner Ogle, whom he constituted a commodore. The <i>Resolution</i> returned to England with Rear-Admiral Robert Digby, and was shortly afterwards sent out to North America with Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves. When Rodney returned to the West Indies after his visit to the coast of North America in the summer of 1780 he took the <i>Resolution</i> with him, shortly after which Ogle, having been promoted rear-admiral, went home, leaving Manners in command of the ship. In March of that year he had also been elected in his absence MP for Cambridgeshire; he was never to take up the seat.<br>
<br>In 1781 the <i>Resolution</i> went north with Sir Samuel Hood, and took part in the action off Cape Henry on 5 September. She was afterwards with Hood at St Kitts in January 1782, and in the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782), was in the centre of the line, the third ship astern of the <i>Formidable</i>. In the action Manners received several severe wounds, in addition to having one leg shot off. From the strength of his constitution hopes were entertained of his recovery. He was put on board the frigate <i>Andromache</i> for a passage to England, but some days later tetanus set in, from which he died, probably at sea in the Caribbean, on 23 April. Although his early career had been marked by ambition galvanized by social status Manners was by all accounts a brave, talented, and well-respected young officer at his death.<br>
