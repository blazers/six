<span class="headword">Marsham,  Thomas</span>  (1747/8&#150;1819), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, possibly of China Row, Chelsea, London, received a good education and was later employed at the Exchequer Loan Office, and then engaged as secretary to the West India Dock Company for several years. Marsham began the first authoritative work on British insects based upon the Linnaean system, entitled <span class="italic">Entomologia Britannica</span>, of which only one volume, <span class="italic">Coleoptera Britannica</span>, was published in 1802. In this work he described 1307 species native to Britain. Nine papers on various entomological subjects were read by him before the Linnean Society and published in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and he was also author of &#145;A system of entomology&#146;, in Hall's <span class="italic">Royal Encyclopaedia</span> (1788).<br>
<br>Marsham was a co-founder of the Linnean Society; he was appointed secretary at the first &#145;fellows' meeting&#146; on 26 February 1788. The other two primary co-founders, Samuel Goodenough (1743&#150;1827) and Sir James Edward Smith (1759&#150;1828), became treasurer and president, respectively, and the first general meeting was held on 8 April 1788. By September 1796 Marsham was staying at Upper Berkeley Street, London, from where he wrote to Smith about his worries for the society's future. Marsham was secretary of the Linnean Society until 1798, the year he was elected treasurer.<br>
<br>By 1802 Marsham was married to a Miss Symes of Ufford, Northamptonshire; the couple had two daughters. In that year he joined the volunteer corps as an officer. Several months later, on 14 November, Alexander MacLeay wrote to William Kirby: &#145;I do not believe that I have seen our friend Marsham four times since the beginning of the war &hellip; [and] Mrs Marsham says she is more bored with soldiering than she ever was with insect hunting&#146;  (Jarvis, 92).<br>
<br>Marsham was treasurer of the Linnean Society until his resignation in 1816, after it became apparent that the society's funds had been mismanaged. Marsham had incurred heavy losses from the publication of his book and, having used society funds to clear his debts, found himself unable to repay the moneys. He died in stricken circumstances on 26 November 1819, having parted with his collections shortly before. He was survived by his wife. The specimens of British Coleoptera which featured in Marsham's book were acquired by James Francis Stephens (1792&#150;1852).<br>
