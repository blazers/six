<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">landscape gardener</span>, was baptized on 13 November 1704 in Dublin, the fourteenth child and youngest of the nine sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12091/', "James Hamilton, sixth earl of Abercorn (c.1661&#150;1734)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (1667/8&#150;1754), daughter of Sir Robert Reading, first baronet, of Dublin. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford (BA, 1723), where he formed a lifelong friendship with Henry Fox (later first Baron Holland), to whose social, financial, and vocational backing his career owed much. Next, making the grand tour to Rome, he became inspired by the landscape paintings of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and Salvator Rosa. In 1727 he became MP for Strabane in the Irish parliament.<br>
<br>In 1732, on a second visit to Rome with Henry and Stephen Fox, Hamilton's portrait was painted by Antonio David (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;<i>c</i>.1738). The portrait shows him fashionably dressed, holding a gun, with an attendant, dogs, and a brace of partridges&#151;he was highly rated as a shot. In Rome he acquired antique sculpture, including busts of Roman emperors and a 7 feet tall <span class="italic">Bacchus</span>, later to adorn his property at Painshill.<br>
<br>In 1734 Hamilton's father died, and, needing an income, in 1738 he gained a position in the household of Frederick, prince of Wales, through the influence of his sister Lady Archibald Hamilton, the prince's mistress. He was MP for Truro (1741&#150;7) and receiver-general in Minorca (1743&#150;57). He was dismissed by the prince of Wales in 1747, and the loss of Minorca in 1756 cost him his receivership. Henry Fox secured a secret service pension for him of &pound;1200 a year as compensation.<br>
<br>By 1737 Hamilton had begun to acquire over 200 acres of what was regarded as desolate heathland sloping down to the River Mole, near Cobham in Surrey, which he turned into the ornamental Painshill Park. He used his varied talents as a soil improver, a collector and grower of newly available exotic trees and shrubs, and an impresario of entertaining devices&#151;ranging from a water-wheel pump to a grotto, a hermitage, and rare sculptures and follies, ingeniously placed&#151;to create a series of agreeable surprises on a tour revealing successive aspects of nature presented in terms of art. He created a 30 acre lake and planted two vineyards.<br>
<br>Hamilton was recognized by his contemporaries as having contributed decisively to the emergence of the new naturalistic style of English landscape, and his guidance was sought by his friends for such outstanding creations as Stourhead, Bowood, Hagley, and Holland Park. It was a time when converging philosophical, political, scientific, and economic influences inspired a number of English landowners to transform their estates into prosperous miniature centres for civilized living. To fulfil the process, however, they needed to integrate nature with inspired landscape design in terms consistent with practical land management, silviculture, and land forms which could be changed only within strict limits. By his talents, dedication, social connections, and ability to get quick and exciting results within narrow constraints of money and manpower, Hamilton devised the right model at the right moment. However, in 1773 he was forced to sell Painshill in order to repay a loan from Henry Fox.<br>
<br>Hamilton was married three times. Nothing is known of his first wife, whom he married <i>c</i>.1730, but they had two daughters. In 1772 he married Agnes, daughter of Dr David Cockburn of Ayr, and they had one daughter. After Agnes's death later that same year Hamilton moved to Bath, then in its social heyday, where a benign-looking portrait shows him at seventy, grasping a book entitled <span class="italic">Views of Painshill</span>. In 1774 he married Frances Calvert. Hamilton died on 11 September 1786 in Bath and was buried at Bath Abbey.<br>
<br>Neglect, culminating in damage and destruction, almost destroyed Painshill, until Elmbridge borough council acquired most of it for the Painshill Park Trust, which revived Hamilton's original designs through a vigorous programme of renewal.<br>
