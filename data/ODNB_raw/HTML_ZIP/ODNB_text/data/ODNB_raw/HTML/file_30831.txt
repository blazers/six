<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Ronald  Bodley</span>  (1906&#150;1982), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Bournemouth on 10 September 1906, the eldest of six sons (there were no daughters) of Maitland Bodley Scott, general practitioner in Bournemouth, and his wife, Alice Hilda Duranc&eacute; George. He was educated at Marlborough College and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he obtained a degree in natural science in 1928. Bodley Scott completed his clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, graduating BM, BCh in 1931. The same year he married (Edith) Daphne (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward McCarthy, of the Royal Marine Artillery.<br>
<br>Once qualified, Bodley Scott served a short period as house physician at St Bartholomew's and then left to join the family practice in Bournemouth. However, he had evidently made such an impression as a student and house physician that he was invited to return, first as chief assistant to A. E. Gow, and then as first assistant on the medical unit. This was a recognized route for those who were going on to consulting practice. During this time he obtained his MRCP (1933), and developed an interest in clinical haematology. He obtained his DM at Oxford in 1937, on the newly developed technique of bone marrow aspiration. His studies on the subject led to his describing with A. H. T. Robb-Smith the clinical entity of histiocytic medullary reticulosis in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1939.<br>
<br>In 1936 Bodley Scott became a consultant at the Woolwich Memorial Hospital, a post he filled until 1971. During the Second World War he entered the Royal Army Medical Corps, and in 1941 was sent to the Middle East, where he was responsible for the medical division in no. 63 and no. 43 general hospitals. He was elected FRCP in 1943. At the end of the war he returned to London. He was one of the first new assistant physicians to be appointed at St Bartholomew's (1946) and he rapidly became an internationally recognized figure in the management of leukaemia and lymphoma. He introduced drug treatment for these invariably fatal illnesses, and was one of the first in Britain to use nitrogen mustard and other chemotherapeutic agents. He remained a shrewd general physician, with a penetrating intelligence and great clinical skill.<br>
<br>In 1949 Bodley Scott was appointed physician to the household of King George VI and from 1952 to 1973 he was physician to Queen Elizabeth II. He was appointed KCVO in 1964 and GCVO in 1973. He was made consultant physician to British Railways (Eastern Region) in 1957; honorary consultant in haematology to the army from 1957; consultant physician to the Florence Nightingale Hospital in 1958; consultant physician to the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers in 1963; and in the same year honorary consultant to the Royal Navy. Two years later he became honorary consultant to the Ministry of Defence.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians, Bodley Scott was successively councillor (1963&#150;6), censor (1970), and vice-president (1972). He was president of the Medical Society of London (1965&#150;6), president of the British Society of Haematology (1966&#150;7), president of the section of medicine of the Royal Society of Medicine (1967&#150;8). He was made a member of the court of assistants of the Society of Apothecaries of London in 1964, and became master in 1974. He served as a member of council of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund from 1968, and the British Heart Foundation from 1975, eventually becoming chairman of the latter.<br>
<br>As a teacher Bodley Scott excelled in a postgraduate setting. His achievements in his speciality were acknowledged by invitations to give the Lettsomian lecture of the Medical Society of London in 1957, the Langdon-Brown lecture in 1957, the Croonian lecture in 1970, and the most prestigious lecture offered by the Royal College of Physicians, the Harveian oration, in 1976. To appreciate Bodley Scott's breadth of vision it is necessary to turn to his Lettsomian lecture on leukaemia. It must be remembered that at that time no adult patient survived acute leukaemia; but Bodley Scott insisted that &#145;although the outlook was bleak, the use of active drugs must be attempted in order to achieve a remission of the disease, for a nihilistic approach would create an impenetrable barrier against therapeutic advance&#146;. As well as lecturing, Bodley Scott also achieved academic success with his edition of <span class="italic">Price's Textbook of Medicine</span> (12th edn, 1978), and with the <span class="italic">Medical Annual</span>, which he edited from 1979; both of these owed much to his encyclopaedic knowledge of medicine and his clear, concise style. He published his last book, <span class="italic">Cancer&#151;the Facts</span>, in 1979.<br>
<br>Bodley Scott combined a remarkable ability in clinical medicine with a deep awareness of the need for innovation and experiment. He was a wise observer of humanity and behind his reserved, almost shy manner he appreciated people's foibles and commented on them with an astringent wit. Despite his reserve, however, he could speak forcibly and with effect.<br>
<br>Following the death in 1977 of his first wife, in 1980 Bodley Scott married Jessie, the widow of Alexander Page Gaston, of Sevenoaks, and daughter of Thomas Mutch, farmer in Aberdeenshire. She survived the car accident near Parma, Italy, on 12 May 1982, in which Bodley Scott died.<br>
