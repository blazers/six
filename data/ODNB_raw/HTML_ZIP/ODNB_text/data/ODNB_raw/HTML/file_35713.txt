<span class="headword">Reid,  Archibald David</span>  (1844&#150;1908), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 8 June 1844 in Aberdeen, the fourth of the five sons (in a family of thirteen children) of George Reid, blacksmith and later manager of the Aberdeen Copper Company, and his wife, Esther Tait. Archy, as he was known, was the younger brother of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67609/', "Sir George Reid (1841&#150;1913)")</script>; his younger brother Samuel Reid (1854&#150;1912) was also an artist. In the summer of 1854 Reid's father was declared bankrupt; his brother George was removed from Aberdeen grammar school and Archibald himself was sent to Robert Gordon's Hospital, a charity school. He left school at fourteen and was employed in the counting-house of the flour miller, art collector, and connoisseur John Forbes White. One of the earliest collectors of contemporary Dutch and French painting in Britain, White developed close links with the artists whose paintings he had bought, particularly Gerrit Mollinger and Jozef Isra&euml;ls. He sent both George and later Archy to study in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In Aberdeen, Reid gained his first practical training in art at the mechanics' institute. At the age of twenty-three he went to Edinburgh for three years, where he attended the classes of the Trustees' Academy and, later, the life class of the Royal Scottish Academy. This training, however, seems to have had far less effect on his art than did the influence of the realist art of his Dutch and French contemporaries and of his artist friends in north-east Scotland, particularly his brother George, their mutual friend George Paul Chalmers, and the mentor to all three, John Forbes White. White became Archy Reid's guardian, teacher, and promoter. As he had with George, White set out to define Archy's art, to alter his subject matter, and to improve his technique (even to the point of painting on his pictures when he felt it necessary). For Archy the effect of the contact with White was, if anything, still more profound than it had been for George. Reid could, when required, turn out works in an earlier style: minutely realistic, colourful scenes of the local fishing villages such as <span class="italic">Boys and Buoys</span> (Aberdeen Art Gallery) fall into this category. However, the influence of realism and its accompanying emphasis on tonality soon came to dominate his art, as is revealed in paintings such as <span class="italic">On the Aberdeen Bents</span> (Aberdeen Art Gallery), which is a direct translation of Isra&euml;ls's much employed theme of a girl waiting on the shore for the return of the men from fishing. Reid's painting has less sombre realism than many Dutch works on this theme: he relieves the tension somewhat by depicting the girl busy mending nets rather than gazing out to sea. The atmosphere is altogether bleaker, however, in <span class="italic">A Lone Shore</span> of 1874 (Aberdeen Art Gallery): in this large painting the outcome of the fishing trip&#151;a wrecked boat&#151;is clearly visible. <span class="italic">A Lone Shore</span> was accepted to hang at the Royal Academy in 1875, but the bleakness of the subject matter and treatment did not appeal to the public and it remained unsold in the artist's studio until his death.<br>
<br>As a young man Reid was dark-haired and blue-eyed, and sported a neat beard and moustache, and a jaunty tam-o'-shanter. Without the same familial responsibilities as his older brother, he was free to travel extensively; a persistent illness (he had an operation in 1887) further reduced the family's expectations of him. He painted in France and in 1874 was in the Netherlands; White funded a journey to Spain. Reid also visited Italy and in 1878 he studied at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris. The careers of the two brothers, George and Archibald, were closely interlinked: George influenced Archibald in his choice of subject matter. (He painted, for example, some of the first still lifes of flowers in Scottish art, a subject which had been introduced to Scotland by his brother.) He also had a career as a portrait painter but this was never as successful as that of George, though he would occasionally take over commissions which George had declined. George was, however, scrupulous in avoiding any hint of nepotism, voting for election to the Royal Scottish Academy other artists in preference to his brother. Indeed, it was not until 1892 that Archy Reid was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy and then only as an associate member. Five years later he became a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Oils. He was also a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour.<br>
<br>From 1883 Reid lived at St Lukes, Kepplestone, George Reid's home in Aberdeen. Ten years later, on 26 July 1893, he married Margaret Sim (<i>b</i>. 1839/40), daughter of George Sim, a farmer from Kintore, Aberdeenshire; they had no children. In Aberdeen, Reid moved in a lively intellectual circle. He was a member of the New Deer Academy, which included the theologian and semantic scholar William Robertson Smith and the astronomer David Gill. He was also actively involved in the organization and hanging of the Aberdeen Artists' Society exhibitions which began in 1885. Towards the end of his life he produced many landscapes in charcoal. He made some etchings and also some illustrations, including some for the menus for the meetings of the Aberdeen Pen and Pencil Club, of which he was a member. He died of heart failure at Wareham, Dorset, on 30 August 1908 and was buried in St Peter's cemetery, Aberdeen. His wife survived him.<br>
