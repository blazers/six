<span class="headword">Andrews,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1575, <em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, was baptized on 31 July 1575 at St Leonard Eastcheap, London, the second son of William Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1588), twice joint warden of the Butchers' Company, and his wife, Elizabeth Harrison, of the same parish. From Merchant Taylors' School he passed to St John's College, Oxford, in October 1591, graduating BA in 1595 and MA in 1599. Here, besides showing a distinct talent for Latin verse, he responded as fellow and rhetoric reader of the college in a disputation in moral philosophy held before James I in August 1605  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 75, fols. 138, 139). In October he was &#145;called away out of the University&#146; by Charles Blount, earl of Devonshire, who died six months later; he then procured leave to visit France.<br>
<br>On his return Andrews received the degree of bachelor of medicine in June 1607, and later in the year contributed money to the dramatic entertainments staged during the seasonal revels of &#145;The Christmas Prince&#146;  (St John's College, Oxford, MS 52, fols. 10, 115). As MD (June 1608) he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1610, and as vice-president of St John's defended the contested election of William Laud to the headship in 1611  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 388, fols. 328&#150;67). He resigned in April 1612 to marry Mary, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Richard May of Islington, with whom he had nine children.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood says that Andrews &#145;had improv'd himself much in his Faculty in his Travels beyond the Seas, which afterwards made him highly esteemed among learned men and others&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1st edn, 1.802). During the two decades in which he practised medicine in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, Andrews struck up friendships with literary men. With Ben Jonson, John Selden, Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Henry Spelman, and Thomas Farnaby he signed a pledge to promote Caleb Morley's scheme &#145;for the attayning &amp; retayninge of languages &amp; other partes of good literature&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 1466, fol. 16). To Farnaby he addressed verses between 1615 and 1629, and at some time in this period when his children mutilated a book that he had borrowed from John Donne he replaced the damaged sections in manuscript, receiving a graceful Latin poem in return  (Donne, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 2nd edn, 1635, 278). His acquaintance with Ben Jonson is known from his professional dealings with two William Cavendishes, the one first earl (and later duke) of Newcastle  (BL, Add. MS 70499, fols. 145, 160, 168), and the other second earl of Devonshire. A comic portrait of the playwright is preserved in Andrews's verses on a visit in August 1627 to Poole's Hole, near Devonshire's seat of Chatsworth, that survive in a manuscript anthology copied by Newcastle's secretary  (BL, Harley MS 4955, fols. 164&#150;171<i>v</i>). This incorporates, along with important texts of masques by Jonson and poems by Donne, some eighty-five pieces apparently of Andrews's own composition  (ibid., fols. 57&#150;87<i>v</i>, 145&#150;72, 189&#150;190<i>v</i>) ranging from political and religious epigrams to journey-poems, epithalamia, and elegies. In June 1631, while sending some verses of his own to Newcastle, Andrews mentioned that &#145;M<sup>r</sup> Johnson hath promised some-what as soone as it is readie&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70499, fol. 145).<br>
<br>Andrews's professional standing is witnessed by his appointment in January 1633 as deputy to William Harvey at St Bartholomew's Hospital  (Keynes, 196&#150;7). The post, with its annual salary of &pound;33 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., was confirmed in October, when he was voted &pound;20 &#145;for his paines in visitinge and prescribinge for the poore of this howse for the yeare last past&#146;  (ibid., 202&#150;3). One year later he was complaining in a letter to Newcastle of failing health and &#145;the forgettfullness of some eminent freinds, of whome I expected most&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 70499, fol. 160). He died in St Mary Aldermanbury on 25 July 1634 and was buried five days later in the chancel of the parish church. By his will, dated 20 November 1632, he bequeathed to his widow his house in the churchyard, with &pound;1600 to be divided between his two surviving sons and three daughters.<br>
