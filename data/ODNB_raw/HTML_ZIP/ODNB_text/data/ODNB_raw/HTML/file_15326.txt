</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemble,  Stephen George</span>  (1758&#150;1822), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 3 April 1758 at Kington, Herefordshire, the second son of the eight surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15325/', "Roger Kemble (1722&#150;1802)")</script> and his wife, Sarah (1735&#150;1807), the daughter of the theatre manager John Ward and Sarah Butcher. Both his parents were performers in John Ward's touring company, which Roger managed from 1766. Because of this peripatetic beginning Stephen received little formal education, although his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15322/', "John Philip Kemble")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15316/', "Charles Kemble")</script> were educated at Douai. At the age of fourteen he was briefly apprenticed to a chemist in Coventry, &#145;but stimulated by the example of his brothers and sisters, then on the stage, sought for theatrical glory in an itinerant company&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span>). He appears to have served his theatrical apprenticeship with Mark Moore's troupe at Painswick. In 1781 he joined Tate Wilkinson's company, and played the Earl of Essex at Doncaster in October and the title role in <span class="italic">St Ignatius</span> at York in December. In 1782 he toured to Cork, playing Pyrrhus in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span> and Wellborn in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>, before transferring to the Capel Street Theatre, Dublin.<br>
<br>On 24 September 1783 Kemble made his London d&eacute;but, as Othello, at Covent Garden. Sardonic biographers suggest he was employed in error for his elder brother, John Philip, who joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25516/', "Sarah Siddons")</script> at the rival house in Drury Lane. The author of <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> was less than charitable about his Othello:<blockquote>Never was the heroic Moor so literally murdered. Many exclamations excited laughter; and so fond was he of Miss Satchell, the gentle Desdemona, that in embracing her he would have a kiss; the collision left one side of her face quite black, much to the entertainment of the audience. (Haslewood, 248)</blockquote>The managers at Covent Garden were not taken with him, but Elizabeth Satchell (1762/3&#150;1841) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15317/', "Kemble, Elizabeth")</script>] was. She married him on 20 November 1783 at St George's, Bloomsbury. Kemble saw out the season playing Bajazet in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Richmond in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Colredo in Henry Jones's <span class="italic">The Heroine of the Cave</span>, and other minor roles, and was paid a modest &pound;95 for 190 performances. He fared best with the critics as Sealand in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>. The <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span> thought &#145;his countenance &hellip; manly, agreeable, and expressive; and his voice particularly adapted to give energy to such paternal feelings, as Sealand is described to have. His greatest deficiency is&#151;a taste of manner, and elegance of person&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). These criticisms were to be repeated throughout his career.<br>
<br>The Kembles left London and toured the provinces, making their d&eacute;but at Edinburgh, as Othello and Desdemona, on 23 February 1786. Stephen played several leading roles, including King John, Chamont in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, Don Carlos in Edward Young's <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>, and Old Norval in John Home's <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, in a season marred by the death of the couple's first child, George. The Kembles established a regular pattern of winter seasons in Edinburgh and summer seasons at George Colman's Haymarket in London, where &#145;he [was] merely useful in sentimental <i>Old Men</i>&#146;  (Haslewood, 248), including Dominick in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, Bonniface in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Mr Sturdy in <span class="italic">Half an Hour after Supper</span>, and a favourite, Sir Christopher Curry in Colman the younger's <span class="italic">Inkle and Yarico</span>.<br>
<br>In 1790, with two small children to support, Kemble began his management career at Coventry. The following spring the Kembles played Freeport and Amelia in the elder Colman's <span class="italic">The English Merchant</span>, at the new Theatre Royal in Newcastle, managed by his brother-in-law, Charles Edward Whitlock. Kemble assumed the management of Newcastle and the circuit of Chester, Lancaster, and Sheffield theatres in March 1791 for &pound;300 a year rent and &pound;1000 for properties. He enthusiastically programmed new plays and enticed London performers north, but without permission to raise house prices to cover the increased expenses. He escaped to the Haymarket for the summer, where Elizabeth Kemble chose his two-act farce entitled <span class="italic">The Northern Inn, or, The Days of Good Queen Bess</span>, adapted from Heywood, as her much needed benefit.<br>
<br>Back in Newcastle for the autumn and unperturbed by initial set-backs, Kemble expanded and leased the Edinburgh and Glasgow theatres from John Jackson for &pound;1350 a year. The <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span> (5 November 1791) thought this would enable &#145;the manager, whose spirited exertions have always kept pace with the contingencies of his situation, to maintain a better company, and pay greater salaries, than any other connection out of London could support&#146;  (Robinson, 138). Initially Edinburgh promised much, netting more than &pound;470 over its first four nights, but Kemble and Jackson, the previous manager, fell out over the terms of the lease and patent. The arguments are documented in such publications as <span class="italic">A Statement of Facts &hellip; Relative to the Theatre Royal of Edinburgh</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">A Comparative View of the Rights and Merits of Mrs Harriet Esten and Mr Stephen Kemble</span> (1793). In brief, when Kemble reneged on the terms of his one-year lease, Jackson agreed to lease the theatre for the 1793 season to Mrs Esten, a popular actress, and one of the patentees, the duke of Hamilton, allowed her the patent. Denied lease and patent on the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, Kemble opened a rival theatre in the quickly refitted Circus on 12 January 1793. His success, &pound;180 on the first night, was quashed when Mrs Esten enforced her patent and had the new theatre temporarily closed on 6 February, and allowed only &#145;amusements of various kinds&#146;, including concerts and &#145;imitations&#146;. Reconciliation must have occurred during the spring, because by June 1793 Mrs Esten was performing for Kemble at Newcastle, and he advertised his sole management of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, in 1794.<br>
<br>Even while the debate over Edinburgh raged, Kemble had run a full touring season out of Newcastle and seen off a printed complaint from John Edwin about his poor salary, benefits, and excessive travelling expenses. He continued to expand, opening theatres at Berwick upon Tweed in 1794, Aberdeen in 1795, and Alnwick in 1796. In 1799 he leased the Durham circuit, with Scarborough, North and South Shields, and Sunderland. This final acquisition may have been to offset the decline at Edinburgh, where as Timothy Plain (otherwise Moncrieff Thriepland) complained to the <span class="italic">Scots Chronicle</span> (later published as <span class="italic">Letters on the Theatre in Edinburgh</span>), Kemble was passing off &#145;the <i>dross</i> of all theatres, merely because the Manager now and then treats us with a peep of his sister, the Siddons, and his brother John&#146;  (Plain, 8). Kemble himself took on more and more roles, although he was primarily suited to &#145;plain sentimental characters&#146;  (ibid., 22), and his modest abilities were not aided by his enormous size: by the 1790s he weighed 18 stone. The critic also accused him of letting the theatre fall into disrepair. Matters were so bad at Edinburgh that his farewell speech as manager in July 1800 was hissed off the stage. Kemble continued his management of the Newcastle and Durham circuits, but here too he was beset by criticism of the company and the condition of the theatres' fabric. In 1804 the proprietors of Newcastle were so exasperated that they advertised the theatre to let. Even the once loyal <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span> only advertised shows with London performers. In November 1806 Kemble yielded the management of Newcastle to William Macready.<br>
<br>Kemble continued to act and returned to Drury Lane in 1802 in the character of Falstaff. He composed a poem to mark his arrival:<blockquote>
<div>&hellip; all good honest flesh, and blood, and bone,<br>
</div>
<div>And weighing, more or less, some thirty stone!<br>
</div>
<div>Upon the northern coast by chance we caught him,<br>
</div>
<div>And hither in a broad-wheeled waggon brought him;<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Blest with unwieldiness (at least), his size<br>
</div>
<div>Will favour find in every critic's eyes;<br>
</div> (Kemble, <span class="italic">Odes</span>, 26)</blockquote>Although the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> felt he was &#145;merely reciting the text, in the habit of Falstaff, instead of entering into the true jovial spirit of the character&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), the role became a speciality and he performed it at Manchester in 1804 and at Covent Garden in 1806. His performance record is patchy after this. In 1809 he brought out <span class="italic">Odes, Lyrical Ballads, and Poems</span>, a collection of his songs, addresses, and miscellaneous poems, including an intriguing pair: the pro-trade &#145;On the Slave Trade&#146; (1784) and the counter-poem of 1808, &#145;Being fully convinced of my former errors&#146;. Many of the addresses are topical, and the tone of the collection is overwhelmingly patriotic, revealing his keen ear for audience-rousing oratory.<br>
<br>Kemble returned to management briefly at Whitehaven in 1814, and as stage manager at Drury Lane in 1818, when he took the opportunity to cast his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15319/', "Henry Stephen Kemble")</script>, in many unsuitable leading roles and to produce <span class="italic">Flodden Field</span>, a romantic drama, written by father and son. The following season Kemble returned to acting, but stepped down with the arrival of the acting phenomenon Edmund Kean in the company. His final performance was as the Miller in <span class="italic">The King and the Miller of Mansfield</span>, by Robert Dodsley, on 26 April 1820. Kemble died on 5 June 1822 at The Grove, near Durham, and was buried on 11 June in the chapel of nine altars in Durham Cathedral. His wife survived him by nineteen years, and both his children, Frances Crawford Kemble (1787&#150;1849) and Henry Stephen Kemble (1789&#150;1836), became performers.<br>
