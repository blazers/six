<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1780, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 16 March 1780 at St John's, Ousebridge, York, the third child (he had two elder sisters) of <a name="cosubject_853"></a><span class="headword">Peter Atkinson</span>  (1735&#150;1805), <span class="occ">architect</span>, and his wife, Magdalen (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1811), daughter of John Righton, who had married on 1 May 1775 at St Mary Bishophill Senior, York. He was the second of three generations of York architects. His father, who was born in or at Ripon, began as a carpenter and then succeeded William Lindley as principal architectural assistant to John Carr of York about 1774. While still assisting Carr, Atkinson senior was undertaking independent commissions such as Hackness Hall, North Riding of Yorkshire, 51 Bootham, York, or Home Farm at Harewood. Peter Atkinson the younger and his first wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1825), daughter of the Revd Robert Bownas, whom he married <i>c</i>.1806, had two sons: John Bownas Atkinson (1807&#150;1874) and William Atkinson (1811&#150;1886), who went on to become Carr's successor in practice after the latter's death in 1807. It is presumed that Peter Atkinson the younger was his father's pupil before becoming his partner in 1801, but there is no evidence that he worked directly for Carr, despite certain similarities of style. Atkinson was later in partnership first with Matthew Phillips (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1825) until 1819, then with a former pupil, Richard Hey Sharp (1793&#150;1853), from 1819 to 1827, and finally with his elder son from 1831. This last partnership was dissolved in 1833. Atkinson's younger son, William, eventually became his brother's partner in 1837.<br>
<br>Peter Atkinson the elder died on 19 June 1805 and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Bishophill Senior. In the same year his son followed his father as city steward and husband of York and in that capacity designed the city gaol (1802&#150;7), the new council chamber (1810&#150;11), and the house of correction (1814), before resigning in 1833. The gaol had a nine-bay front with a pedimented centre, surmounted by a clock turret and cupola. Only the proportions of its windows suggested its public character. As steward, Atkinson was also responsible for redesigning the approaches to the city's bridges which were to be rebuilt under his direction, and, in 1833, for the initial layout of a wide new thoroughfare, Parliament Street, which cut across the city's historic grain. Atkinson also extended the women's prison in the castle yard by repeating the end bays of Carr's assize courts opposite. In 1818 he demolished the range of jury rooms at the latter, and rebuilt them to a different plan, but in 1824 neither of his two schemes won for his partnership the lucrative commission for the new prison to be built within the castle yard. He rebuilt the Foss Bridge in 1811, and the Layerthorpe Bridge in 1829, as well as winning the important competition to rebuild the Ouse Bridge in the city centre from 1810 to 1820. Other public buildings by Atkinson included the subscription library and the concert room, both in York, the Bradford dispensary, and the completion of the Bradford grammar school. The concert room, built to accommodate the music festival of 1825, was a major extension to Lord Burlington's assembly rooms, through which they were approached. The orchestra was placed in a broad apse and the walls ornamented with giant Grecian pilasters. &#145;Messrs Atkinson&#146; also designed the temporary galleries and orchestra within the nave of York Minster for the festival of 1835. Among their drawings is one for gallery fronts to be executed in &#145;paper&#146;  (&#145;The Atkinson/Brierley drawings&#146;, Borth. Inst.).<br>
<br>Atkinson would have assisted his father with country house commissions such as the extension of Ormsby Hall, Lincolnshire (1803), and Brockfield Hall, Yorkshire (1804&#150;7). He was responsible for a new rectory at Middleton on the Wolds, and the new residence in the close at York, the last in a Gothic style also adopted for the new south range of Bolton Hall, where his patron was the duke of Devonshire. Atkinson was also involved in the building of a terrace of speculative houses called South Parade (1824&#150;8), where he lived at no. 17 from 1827 to 1833.<br>
<br>During the period 1820&#150;31 the successive partnerships designed sixteen churches, all in the Gothic style. The two earliest are at Sproatley and Wainfleet All Saints, the former built of yellow gault brick. The rest were constructed of ashlar or with ashlar dressings. Twelve were built for the commissioners for the building of new churches, under the act of 1818. By choosing either a simplified Early English or Perpendicular style, and by the most careful attention to economy, Atkinson also managed to provide at least a tower (for South Crosland) or spires (at Heckmondwike, Linthwaite, and Golcar): the towers distinguished his churches from the nearby and often equally expensive nonconformist chapels. (The construction of St Andrew, Travis Street, Manchester, to his design cost &pound;9988 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., while the Friends' meeting-house nearby cost &pound;12,000). Though none of the churches has survived unaltered, those at Heckmondwike, Golcar, and Linthwaite retain their cast-iron window frames, which betray their late Georgian date. The spires, however, might be of the 1840s.<br>
<br>The Atkinsons' banqueting house at Naburn Lock is Grecian of the boldest character and suggests the newer style that was developed by Peter Atkinson's sons during their long and successful practice in York. The accumulated drawings of the Carr&#150;Atkinson partnership were sold by public auction by Christies on 13 December 1988 and subsequently dispersed. They included a scheme for a bank at Huddersfield dated 1827, drawings of Gilling Castle of 1815, and projected alterations to Denton Park of 1826.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife in 1825, Atkinson married Joanna (1797&#150;1837), a professional singer and a daughter of Thomas Goodall. Following a financial crisis in 1832 he resigned from his post as city receiver on 15 January 1833 and, in order to protect his son from the worst effects of bankruptcy, dissolved their partnership in March that year. After calling on his creditors to submit their claims on 13 March 1833, Atkinson left York for Calcutta, where he died on 13 January 1843. His second wife had also died there in 1837.<br>
