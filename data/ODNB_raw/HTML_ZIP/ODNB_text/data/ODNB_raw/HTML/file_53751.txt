<span class="headword">Fairbairn,  John</span>  (1794&#150;1864), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician in Cape Colony</span>, son of James Fairbairn, tenant of Carolside mill, and his wife, Agnes Bruce, was born at Legerwood, near Berwick, Scotland, on 9 April 1794. He attended Edinburgh University in 1812 (studying classics, theology, and medicine), but poverty prevented him graduating. As a schoolmaster in Newcastle upon Tyne, Fairbairn wrote articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Star</span>, both edited by Thomas Pringle, future secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society. Pringle was the first of Fairbairn's several mentors and, in 1822, persuaded him to emigrate to Cape Town, promising a literary and teaching career in the recently annexed Cape Colony. Fairbairn responded enthusiastically, writing that they could become the &#145;Franklins of the Kaap&#146;  (Pringle, 176&#150;7).<br>
<br>Fairbairn initially taught at the Classical and Commercial Academy in the Keizergracht (Darling Street), which Pringle and he founded but which closed in 1825. He was editor (1824&#150;59) and eventually proprietor (1835&#150;64) of the <span class="italic">South African Commercial Advertiser</span> (<span class="italic">SACA</span>). Published in Dutch and English, this first South African newspaper was immediately threatened with government censorship, but Fairbairn's resistance led to an ordinance safeguarding freedom of the press. Fairbairn, whose journalism was coloured by his Ricardian political economy, initially believed that British settlers had a divine and heroic role to play in the Cape. His overly theoretical approach led him to seemingly contradictory policies, causing his contemporary and modern detractors to see only opportunism in his editorials. He grew increasingly pessimistic about a British civilizing mission, since his chosen means, a free press and constitutional reform, required a limit on colonial expansion and cultural homogeneity. He played a major role in establishing the Cape's educational system and in modernizing its financial institutions. His activities in banking and insurance brought him considerable profit. In 1845 he founded the Mutual Life Assurance Society of the Cape of Good Hope, which later became, as Old Mutual, South Africa's largest financial company.<br>
<br>Criticism of the government's arbitrary powers and its use of patronage led to Fairbairn's call for representative institutions. However, the strategic importance of the colony meant that the British government would not leave it to a legislature certain to be dominated by a more numerous, wealthy, but questionably loyal, Cape Dutch-Afrikaner electorate. Nor, in the era of emancipation, could a slave-holding society be relinquished to settler control.<br>
<br>Initially Fairbairn's relations with this Afrikaner &eacute;lite were cordial, and he must have hoped for its support over representative government, given his assertion that all who made Africa their home, whether from &#145;England or Holland&#146; were &#145;all Africans&#146;  (<span class="italic">SACA</span>, 17 March 1824). Moreover, his attitude to emancipation would have won endorsement. While he claimed to favour the abolition of slavery, he distanced himself from those who advocated &#145;liberty&#146; on &#145;moral and religious grounds&#146;, arguing for a &#145;statecraft&#146; determined by the &#145;principles of Political Science&#146;. &#145;The Ten commandments&#146;, Fairbairn wrote, might be employed by others, but he was &#145;content with the Multiplication Table&#146;  (<span class="italic">SACA</span>, 2 March 1831). Slaves could only be freed if compensation was paid.<br>
<br>Yet Fairbairn's conviction that the newly arrived British colonists had a unique role to play in making the Cape a &#145;fit abode for free men&#146; was resented. His British patriotism led to relations with Afrikaners cooling, bringing serious consequences for his political and financial ambitions. Moreover, despite his tortuous position on abolition, Fairbairn supported Dr John Philip's campaign&#151;parallel with that of the anti-slavery movement in Britain&#151;to extend civil rights to the Cape's Khoi-Khoi (Hottentot) population. Fairbairn distinguished between Khoi-Khoi, held in serf-like bondage, and slaves who, unlike Khoi-Khoi, were property.<br>
<br>Fairbairn's support for &#145;Hottentot emancipation&#146; not only angered Afrikaner farmers and their commercial and professional kinsmen, but also brought hostility from eastern Cape British settlers intent on maintaining control over Khoi-Khoi labourers with a <span class="roman">Vagrancy Act</span>, whose passage the <span class="italic">SACA</span> successfully opposed. In the 1830s Fairbairn became critical of British settler and government expansionism on the colony's eastern frontier. Settlers were located on seized Xhosa land, where incursions and retaliations continued. Conquest bred insecurity and chauvinism, and Fairbairn's editorials blamed the new colonists for increased conflict. The establishment of two conservative newspapers followed: <span class="italic">De Zuid Afrikaan</span> for Afrikaners in the western Cape, and the <span class="italic">Grahamstown Journal</span> for British settlers. Both papers achieved sales at the expense of the <span class="italic">SACA</span>, and threatened Fairbairn's influence and livelihood.<br>
<br>Fairbairn now saw representative institutions imperilling the newly created Khoi-Khoi civil liberties and the increasing economic freedoms which the colony had won. He did not abandon the hope of an elected government but urged a political campaign to create a non-racial, if British led, alliance which would defeat Afrikaner power.<br>
<br>In the 1830s, the <span class="italic">SACA</span> led the attack on existing monopolies and government economic intervention. Fairbairn helped transform the banking system and validated joint stock companies. Championing friendly societies and commercial insurance companies, he became a leader in these institutions. He advocated building railways, regulating merchant shipping, bills of exchange, the reform of auctions, limited liability legislation, mechanisms for rehabilitating insolvents, and the modernization of agriculture. He married Elizabeth (1812&#150;1840), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22104/', "Dr John Philip")</script>, the South African director of the London Missionary Society, in Cape Town on 24 May 1831.<br>
<br>By 1841 Fairbairn's efforts had contributed significantly to the growth of common interests among new Afrikaner and British capitalists and his editorials announced a &#145;reconciliation&#146; which removed the &#145;very appearance of disunion&#146;  (<span class="italic">SACA</span>, 2 Jan 1841). An expanding middle class, resentful of its lack of influence and of privileges given to older commercial rivals, combined in calling for a legislative assembly. When in 1849 the colonial secretary and the governor landed convicts at the Cape, breaking previous promises, a politically astute cabal, including Fairbairn, created an Anti-Convict Association which focused on agitation for self-government. The <span class="italic">SACA</span> became one of the association's major propagandists, joining the call for a boycott of state institutions until the convicts were deported. Grandiloquently, Fairbairn reminded his readers of the social contract made by &#145;Englishmen&#146; in 1688, and of the need to &#145;resist despotism&#146;, that &#145;dry rot of the constitution&#146;  (<span class="italic">SACA</span>, 23 May 1849).<br>
<br>The association's successful boycott, and its almost colony-wide coalition against the government, convinced the administration to redirect the convicts and hastened the government's decision to create an elected assembly. Fairbairn and three other &#145;popular members&#146; were elected to conclude the government's legislative council business and to act as advisers in drafting the proposed constitution. Fairbairn (who was assaulted in his home by a mob incited almost certainly by government officials) was elected with the support of Cape Town merchants, mission station Khoi-Khoi, and rural Afrikaners, each group with its own agenda. When the governor chose to deal with non-constitutional matters first, Fairbairn and his associates resigned and pursued their campaign in London. Although receiving no immediate help from the colonial secretary, their proposals were subsequently accepted, allowing a substantial number of Afrikaners and a smaller group of Khoi-Khoi and ex-slaves to be enfranchised. With his standing among rural Afrikaners restored, Fairbairn was elected to the first legislative assembly as member for the rural Swellendam constituency (1854&#150;64) and increasingly reflected the opinions of his conservative electors.<br>
<br>More and more pessimistic about the efficacy of the British mission, Fairbairn still hoped, in the 1840s, that its influence would overcome &#145;the evil genius of Africa&#146;. By the 1850s, he gloomily prophesied that the civilizing power of the colony would be weakened if it moved beyond its coastal base, as &#145;the repelling genius of Africa becomes stronger&#146;  (<span class="italic">SACA</span>, 13 Dec 1851). He also foresaw that settler expansion would provoke bloody conquest and a &#145;terrible spirit of war and revenge&#146;. The English settlers, he concurred, were &#145;more stern and implacable than the Boers&#146;, and a new generation was emerging &#145;full of enterprize and bent on conquest, whom no government will be able to control&#146;  (John Fairbairn to James Fairbairn, 28 Aug 1851, University of the Witwatersrand, MS A663/BA).<br>
<br>Fairbairn's wife died on 30 May 1840, nine years after their marriage, leaving two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, John Philip, drowned in the Gamtoos River on 1 July 1845, aged eleven. Personal loss and political foreboding blunted the satisfaction Fairbairn might have felt in his achievements. He died on 5 October 1864 at the Wynberg home of his son-in-law, advocate F. S. Watermeyer, and was buried in the Somerset Road cemetery in Cape Town.<br>
