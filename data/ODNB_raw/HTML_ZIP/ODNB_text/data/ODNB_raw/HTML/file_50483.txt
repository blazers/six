<span class="headword">Ude,  Louis-Eustache</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">chef</span>, became a celebrated figure in England in the later 1820s, but little definite is known of his earlier life and circumstances. However, he was French and for a time had been a cook at the court of Louis XVI. He says in the preface to his book, <span class="italic">The French Cook</span> (1813), that he has had &#145;upwards of forty years practice&#146;  (Ude, vi) of his vocation, so he must have begun working in kitchens in the 1770s, somewhere near the beginning in 1774 of the doomed king's reign. He is unlikely to have continued as the king's chef much beyond the flight to Varennes in 1791, and certainly not after the king was guillotined in 1793. In the standard French work  (<span class="italic">Dictionnaire Universal de cuisine</span>, vol. 4, 1892, p. 1803) Joseph Favre wrote that Ude was <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i> to Napoleon's mother, Princess Letitia Bonaparte, for two years. There is, however, a tradition that he fled from the terror to England.<br>
<br>In any case, Ude became chef to Charles William Molyneux, created earl of Sefton in 1771, of whom Joseph Favre says &#145;this very rich lord, who was regarded as the king of English Epicureans, recompensed the services of his cook by leaving him an annual income of one hundred pounds sterling (2500 francs)&#146;  (Favre, 4.1803). There is a story that he left Sefton's service because a guest once added more pepper to his soup. Ude became the chef at the United Service Club, &#145;where his dinners were acknowledged to be better than any other Club could boast&#146;  (Humphreys, 221). The duke of York, &#145;the soldier's friend&#146;, subsequently employed Ude; and it was to the duke's memory that he dedicated the 1828 edition of his cookery book. Ude then became chef at Watier's Club.<br>
<br>First published in London in 1813, Ude's <span class="italic">The French Cook</span> was undoubtedly a great success, going through numerous editions. Although it was not, as Favre argued, the first culinary work to appear in London, there is some truth in the claim that Ude was &#145;one of the first to popularize haute cuisine in London&#146;  (Favre, vol. 4, p. 1803). The saying, &#145;Coquus nascitur non fit&#146;&#151;&#145;cooks are born, not made&#146;&#151;is attributed to him, and in the section of the book entitled &#145;Advice to cooks&#146; he wrote that &#145;Music, dancing, fencing, painting, and mechanics in general, possess professors under twenty years of age, whereas, in the first line of cooking, pre-eminence never occurs under thirty&#146;  (Ude, xix). He also insists that cookery is the most difficult and demanding of the sciences; that there are few good cooks, though many who claim to be; and that a properly qualified cook can be &#145;placed in the rank of artists&#146;  (ibid., xxix).<br>
<br>One well-known quotation attributed to Ude is: &#145;It is very remarkable, that in France, where there is but one religion, the sauces are infinitely varied, whilst in England, where the different sects are innumerable, there is, we may say, but one single sauce&#146;  (www.clairvision.org/UdeSauceQuote). He certainly did write that &#145;sauces &hellip; are the soul of Cookery&#146;  (Ude, xxiii) and also that &#145;Cookery in England, when it is well done, is superior to that of any in the world&#146;  (ibid., xxiv). &#145;How many marriages&#146;, he asks rhetorically, &#145;have been the consequences of meeting at dinner? How much good fortune has been the result of a good supper?&#146;  (ibid.). In an essay, &#145;On cookery&#146;, in the 1828 Philadelphia edition of <span class="italic">The French Cook</span>, Ude says<blockquote>The Ladies of England are unfavourably disposed towards our art &hellip; It is particularly the case with them (and indeed it is so in some measure with our own sex) that they are not introduced to their parent's table till their palates have been completely benumbed by the strict diet observed in the Nursery and Boarding-Schools. (ibid., xxvii)</blockquote>One of Ude's most celebrated dishes was conceived while in the service of the earl of Sefton. This was &#145;an entr&eacute;e of soft roes of mackerel baked in butter and served with a cream sauce&#146;  (Blyth, 105). Another exquisite culinary concoction, first produced for the young Lord George Bentinck, was &#145;a most delicious sweet made with fresh stoned cherries, and which he christened <i>Boudin de cerises &agrave; la Bentinck</i>&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Ude's fame was at its height during the ten years in which he served as chef at Crockford's, the famous gaming club opened in 1828 at 50 St James's by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6713/', "William Crockford")</script>. His appointment was announced by the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> in glowing terms: &#145;Mr Ude of culinary celebrity is engaged by Mr Crockford, to superintend the <i>cuisine</i> of his vast establishment &hellip; Mr Ude is fitting up a house for his own family contiguous to the scene of his official duties, in Albemarle Street&#146;  (Humphreys, 227). Ude had married Barbe Lucot on 4 April 1821 at St George's, Hanover Square; and they lived in Albemarle Street until his death.<br>
<br>At a time when club food consisted chiefly of boiled fowl, mutton, and roast beef, Ude's more refined cooking put Crockford's on the culinary map. He had been enticed to work for the club by the then enormous salary of &pound;1200&#151;out of which he had to pay all his assistant chefs and kitchen staff&#151;and by the prospect of feeding the distinguished and important men who were members. Ude had also expressly obtained &#145;the freedom to order whatever he liked and to cook in whatever manner he chose&#146;  (Blyth, 104).<br>
<br>Conscious of the brilliance of his art, Ude would rage at any who failed to appreciate the privilege. One evening he charged a member 2<i>s</i>. for a red mullet and 6<i>d</i>. for an exquisite sauce, but exploded with anger when the diner objected to paying for the sauce as well. &#145;The imbecile must think that red mullets come out of the sea with my sauce in their pockets&#146;, he protested  (Blyth, 115&#150;16).<br>
<br>Ude's reign at Crockford's ended in 1838 after a fierce disagreement with the management. &#145;There has been a row at Crockfords, and Ude dismissed&#146;, Benjamin Disraeli informed his sister Sarah on 13 October 1838. &#145;He told the Committee that he was worth &pound;4,000 a year&#146;  (Monypenny, 39&#150;40). Ude retired, but confessed to Lord Wombwell that he was very miserable and sat all day at home doing nothing. When Wombwell recommended the exercise of his art for the gratification of his own appetite, Ude replied: &#145;Bah! &hellip; I have not been into my kitchen once, I hate the sight of my kitchen. I dine on roast mutton dressed by a cookmaid!&#146; Asked about Crockford's, Ude admitted that &#145;I love that Club, though they are ingrats&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Ude remained in London until his death at Albemarle Street on 10 April 1846. His wife survived him. Reporting his death, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described Ude as &#145;the celebrated <i>chef de cuisine</i> at Crockfords, and author of a popular cookery-book, to which his portrait is prefixed&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 25, 1846, 663).<br>
