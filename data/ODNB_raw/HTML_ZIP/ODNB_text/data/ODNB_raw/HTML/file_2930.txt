<span class="headword">Bosanquet,  Samuel Richard</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">legal and religious writer</span>, was born on 1 April 1800 at Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London, the eldest of six sons of Samuel Bosanquet (1768&#150;1843), of the Forest House, Essex, and the family seat of Dingestow Court, Monmouthshire, and his wife, Laetitia Philippa (1774&#150;1855), youngest daughter of James Whatman of Vinters, Kent, and his first wife, Sarah. The Bosanquets were descended from a Huguenot family that came to Britain after the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 and became naturalized by private act of parliament in 1703. They subsequently acquired various banking interests: the author's grandfather, also Samuel Bosanquet (<i>c</i>.1747&#150;1806), was a deputy governor of the Levant Company and director of the Bank of England, while generations of the family were employed in the bank of Bosanquet &amp; Co. Samuel Bosanquet was educated at Eton College before matriculating at Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 November 1818. He subsequently gained a second class in classics and a first in mathematics, graduating BA in 1822 and MA in 1829.<br>
<br>Bosanquet entered the Inner Temple as a barrister on 5 May 1826, and was one of the first revising barristers appointed to oversee electoral registration after the passage of the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>. He began to write leading articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span> and published a series of legal commentaries, <span class="italic">New Rules of Pleading</span> (1835), <span class="italic">The Tithe Commutation Act</span> (1837), and lastly <span class="italic">The Poor Law Amendment Acts</span> (1839), which insisted that popular hostility to the new poor law was caused by the wilful misapplication of its provisions by the commission's district agents, and argued that the right of interpretation ought properly to belong to JPs, overseers, and boards of guardians. Bosanquet's localist impulses, religious convictions, and pronounced sympathy with the poor briefly aligned him with the high-Anglican paternalism then propounded in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> magazine, in Tractarian hands since John Henry Newman's accession to the editorship in 1838. Two of his typically trenchant articles, &#145;Pauperism and almsgiving&#146; (July 1840) and &#145;Private alms and poor-law relief&#146; (October 1840), were subsequently revised and published in 1841 as <span class="italic">The Rights of the Poor and Christian Almsgiving Vindicated</span>, in which Bosanquet employed Mendicity Society reports to demonstrate the hopeless inadequacy of working-class wages and insisted that indigence was overwhelmingly attributable to economic dislocation rather than individual failing. Along with evangelical critics such as Thomas Chalmers and Tractarian commentators such as Thomas Mozley and Frederick Oakeley, Bosanquet insisted that individual charity should vastly supersede public provision, and mourned the effacement of squirearchical by bourgeois values. His &#145;The age of unbelief&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in January 1842, was also published in revised form as part of his <span class="italic">Principia: a Series of Essays on the Principles of Evil Manifesting Themselves in these Last Times in Religion, Philosophy, and Politics</span> (1843), a virulently anti-liberal polemic which interpreted &#145;the condition of England&#146; as a portent of the second coming. His <span class="italic">Letter to Lord John Russell on the Safety of the Nation</span> (1848) was animated by the same hostility to political Liberalism and <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism, and Bosanquet's hallmark reassertion of local paternalist mechanisms in place of the agencies of a centralizing state.<br>
<br>Bosanquet's abhorrence of secular political economy and all things progressive increasingly took him towards theological and philosophical questions. But if his contemporary commentary found a ready audience, Bosanquet's philosophical and biblical studies never enjoyed comparable notice. His first foray into these realms, <span class="italic">A New System of Logic</span> (1839), added classical humanism to his extensive demonology and endeavoured to displace the &#145;heathen system&#146; of Aristotelian logic with one of Christian ethics, while a second edition of 1870 appended two lengthy further sections setting out the practical application of his system. Anti-rationalist in spirit and idiosyncratic in method, they were typical of Bosanquet's philosophical <i>&#339;uvre</i>. His <span class="italic">&#145;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&#146;: its Argument Examined or Exposed</span> (1845) denounced the pre-Darwinian book of that name written by Robert Chambers and published anonymously the previous year, and two lengthy biblical commentaries, <span class="italic">The First Seal: being Short Homilies on the Gospel According to St. Matthew</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">The Fourth Seal: being Short Homilies on the Gospel According to St. John</span> (1856), along with <span class="italic">Excelsior</span> (1865) and <span class="italic">The Bible: its Superiority in Character, Composition, Information, and Authority, to all Uninspired Literature</span> (1866), evinced an antagonism towards contemporary biblical scholarship which was to preoccupy his subsequent work. Bosanquet began to learn Hebrew in his sixties in order to study the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and produced a stream of works asserting the inapplicability of reason to revelation, such as his somewhat vainglorious <span class="italic">Interpretation, being Rules and Principles Assisting to the Reading and Understanding of the Holy Scriptures</span> (1874), and exemplifying his brand of figurative and typological exegesis, such as <span class="italic">The Successive Visions of the Cherubim Distinguished and Newly Interpreted</span> (1871), <span class="italic">An Exposition of the First Twenty Chapters of Exodus</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Prophecies of Zechariah, Interpreted and Applied</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">The Interpreter: some Selected Interpretations of Scripture</span> (1878). Bosanquet's own churchmanship was stoutly Anglican but tolerationist: his <span class="italic">Eirenicon: Toleration, Intolerance, Christianity, Christian Unity, the Church of England and Dissent</span> (1867) is its clearest expression. His final published work took him towards the interests of his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2928/', "James Whatman Bosanquet")</script>, the writer on biblical and Assyrian chronology. Entitled <span class="italic">Hindu Chronology and Antediluvian History</span> (1880), it was an annotated reprint of the first part of the orientalist Alexander Hamilton's <span class="italic">Key to Hindoo Chronology</span> of 1820, and attempted to synchronize the two subjects by connecting Indian mythology with early biblical characters.<br>
<br>Bosanquet married Emily Courthope (1809&#150;1869), eldest daughter of George Courthope of Whiligh, Sussex, on 4 February 1830. They had nine children, like Bosanquet's siblings all of them boys, and all but one survived him, among them their third son, Admiral George Stanley Bosanquet (1835&#150;1914), veteran of the Crimea, the Taiping uprising, and the Egyptian campaign, and subsequently aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria in 1884, and their fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31975/', "Sir (Frederick) Albert Bosanquet (1837&#150;1923)")</script>, common serjeant of the City of London, 1900&#150;17. At the death of his father in 1843 Samuel Bosanquet succeeded to the family estates at Dingestow Court. For the ensuing thirty-five years he energetically practised the squirearchical paternalism he always preached, serving (like his father before him and his son after) as JP and then chairman of the Monmouthshire quarter sessions from 1846, and acquiring a high reputation for beneficence to the poor and for the support of myriad local institutions, among them the Monmouth board of guardians, working men's institute, and school and highway boards. He died after a short illness, probably influenza, at Dingestow Court on 27 December 1882 and was buried on 1 January 1883 in the parish churchyard.<br>
