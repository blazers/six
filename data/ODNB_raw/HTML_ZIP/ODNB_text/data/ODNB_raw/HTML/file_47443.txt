<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1814&#150;1968), <span class="occ">publishers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_47443"></a><span class="headword">George Bell</span>  (1814&#150;1890)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 12 October 1814, the fifth of thirteen children of Matthew Bell, bookseller, stationer, and bookbinder in Richmond, Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fall. Bell went to the local grammar school run by the Revd James Tate. After leaving school he assisted his father for two years before he moved to London in 1832 and joined the wholesale booksellers Whittaker &amp; Co. in Ave Maria Lane. There he lodged with his maternal uncle, George Fall, who was an accountant in the City. Having had some success with his shilling handbooks on chess, cricket, angling, and other sports, he set up on his own at 1 Bouverie Street towards the end of 1839, financed by his own savings and a loan from relatives. He married Hannah Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1875) on 24 February 1840 and two months later issued his first catalogue.<br>
<br>Early in his career Bell became the London representative for the academic publishers Parker, Vincent, and Slatter in Oxford and Deighton, Grant, Hall, Stevenson, and Johnson in Cambridge. Bell and the Macmillan brothers, Alexander and Daniel, started out in publishing at the same time and the three men were great friends. The Macmillans introduced Bell to the Scottish trade, and he commissioned six schoolbooks from Scottish schoolmasters. When the brothers moved to Cambridge in 1843 they co-published a book by William Hugh Miller with Bell, and he also issued Alexander Macmillan's anonymous biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley.<br>
<br>An unfortunate partnership with Henry Wood in 1842 ended with Bell paying Wood's creditors after he went bankrupt. For a while Bell continued by himself. He established the corner-stone of his list about 1845 when he began his series of editions of classics with English notes for use in schools. The scholarship and advice of his former headmaster and his son James Tate gave weight to what became <span class="roman">Bell's Grammar School Series</span>. In 1848 Whittaker &amp; Co. bought a half share in the series, enabling Bell to make swifter progress with publication. Such financial assistance contributed in 1849 to a second series, the <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Classica</span>, which gained high standing through F. A. Paley's editions of Hesiod, Homer, Aeschylus, and Euripides.<br>
<br>In 1847 Bell began the <span class="italic">Journal of Education</span> and three years later established, at the instigation of W. J. Thoms, assistant librarian to the House of Lords, <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. About the same time Bell made an unsuccessful venture into bookselling, installing his brother John as manager of 80 St George Road, Brighton, bookseller to the college. His aim of having a retail outlet was fulfilled in 1854 when Bell purchased the business of J. and J. Deighton of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Bell found another partner in F. R. Daldy in 1855. Daldy had been at Rivingtons and brought with him the custom of devotional publishers of suspending business on the principal feasts in the calendar. The partnership lasted until 1873 under the name Bell and Daldy. Together they published the <span class="roman">Elzevier</span> series of standard authors, <span class="roman">Pocket Volumes</span>, select works of favourite authors, and <span class="roman">Library of English Worthies</span>. On a business trip to America and Canada in 1869 Daldy obtained the English right to publish Mrs Beecher Stowe's <span class="italic">Little Foxes</span>. While there he became an advocate for the rights of English authors especially in Canada and later became an authority on copyright, becoming an active member of the English Copyright Association founded in 1872 and giving evidence before the royal commission on copyright in 1897. After Daldy's departure the firm became George Bell &amp; Sons.<br>
<br>Bell established a reputation for books on art, architecture, and archaeology. He published the guides to art treasures by Henry Cole (pseudonymously Felix Summerly), including <span class="italic">The National Gallery</span> (1843). Bell also worked in collaboration with Joseph Cundall, using photographical illustration. Together they produced <span class="italic">Examples of Ornament</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">The Great Works of Raphael Sanzio of Urbino</span> (1866). In 1865 Bell travelled to the south of France and Italy, and brought home photographs which were engraved and used to illustrate Robert Burns's <span class="italic">Rome and the Campagna</span> (1871). Many of his art titles were printed at the Chiswick Press, under Charles Whittingham's management. After Whittingham's death the firm came up for sale and Bell bought it, installing his brother John as manager. About the same time Bell bought the publishing business of his former employer, Whittaker &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Within the profession Bell was called upon to judge trade disputes, and on one occasion at least was authorized by the High Court to do so. He regularly acted as referee on valuation of copyrights. After surveying Hardwick &amp; Co.'s stock he was requested to endorse his valuation of Sowerby's <span class="italic">Botany</span>. He bought the plates and reprinted the edition, but never revised the work.<br>
<br>Under Bell's guidance the firm published an authoritative edition of Pepys's <span class="italic">Diary</span> by Henry B. Wheatley. The firm's list also included Elrington Ball's critical edition of Swift's correspondence and Annie Raine Ellis's editions of Fanny Burney's novels and diary. Bell also bought most of Pickering's publications, including Samuel Weller Singer's ten-volume edition of Shakespeare, which he reissued in 1855. He acquired the <span class="roman">Aldine</span> series of poets in fifty-two volumes revising many and extending the series to eighty-one volumes. However, his biggest purchase was in 1864, when he bought Henry George Bohn's libraries, more than doubling his stock. He paid &pound;33,000 over a period of five years for 435,072 volumes, copyrights, and plates. The purchase was underwritten by William Clowes, the printers, and Spalding and Hodge, the paper merchants. The success of the libraries under his management was such that he soon added to them, establishing his own series.<br>
<br>The firm published reference works including Ferdinand E. A. Gasc's <span class="italic">French Dictionary</span> and Byran's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Painters</span>, and after 1865 became the British publishers of Noah Webster's dictionary. Its list included historical works by Agnes Strickland and Abbot Gasquet and the poetry of C. S. Calverley, Coventry Patmore, Adelaide Proctor, and later Robert Bridges. In the education field, Bell published Pendlebury's famous school arithmetics and the textbooks of Algernon Methuen Marshall Stedman until the author turned publisher in his own right.<br>
<br>In 1860 Bell moved from his address at 28 Belsize Park Gardens to Westcroft, a neighbouring property, where he kept a menagerie of animals on 4 acres of land. In 1882 he moved again, this time to Bramerton, Hampstead Hill Gardens, where, on his uncle's death, his aunt joined him. He inherited much of his uncle's plate, pictures, and furniture. Together with a namesake (but no relation), George William Bell, he supported the Regent's Park Home for Boys, and he took an active role as a churchwarden in the parish. In 1888 he retired from business, dividing the bulk of his property between his six living children, and he died of bronchitis on 27 November 1890. His sons Edward and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40996/', "Ernest Bell")</script> followed him into the business.<br>
<br>George Bell's son <a name="cosubject_66129"></a><span class="headword">Edward Bell</span>  (1844&#150;1926)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Stockwell, London, in October 1844, and educated at St Paul's School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. After taking his degree in 1867 he joined his father's firm. In 1873 Bell married Alice van Rees Hoets (<i>d</i>. 1917). They had three sons, including <a href="#cosubject_66130">Arthur Hugh Bell [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and four daughters. A man of scholarly abilities, Bell translated, edited, and wrote works, adding to the firm's list in the field of art and architecture. Under his guidance there was a steady growth of the firm's educational business and he expanded the firm's trade with the empire through <span class="roman">Bell's Indian and Colonial Library</span>, a series which sold over 1,433,341 books between 1894 and 1911.<br>
<br>The most important new textbooks published by the firm were Baker's and Bourne's mathematics books; these were followed later by the popular schoolbooks of C. V. Durell and Marc Ceppi's French books. In science Bell published the textbooks of the Nobel laureates Sir William Bragg and his son Professor W. L. Bragg, and he extended the firm's reputation on art and architecture with the works of Walter Crane, G. C. Williamson, and Sir Reginald Blomfield.<br>
<br>Bell contributed to the firm's list of translations of the classics and definitive editions of standard English authors. He edited the poetical works of Thomas Chatterton (1875), and translated Goethe, producing <span class="italic">Wilheim Meister's Travels</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Early and Miscellaneous Letters of Goethe</span> (1884); he also translated the <span class="italic">Nibelungenlied</span> (1898). He wrote books on the architecture of ancient Egypt and western Asia, and the pre-Hellenic and Hellenic architecture of the Aegean, as well as various papers.<br>
<br>Bell was the president of the Publishers' Association between 1906 and 1909, and took a leading part in the negotiations with the trade known as the book war, an attempt to establish price regulation which led to the net pricing of books, retelling the events in his account <span class="italic">The Net Book Agreement, 1899, and the Book War, 1906&#150;1908</span>.<br>
<br>Bell's interests included sketching and photography. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, the Classical Association, and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, and was a member of the Wells and Camden Trust. He died on 8 November 1926 of heart failure at his home, The Mount, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>In 1904 the firm moved to purpose-built offices at York House, in Portugal Street, Kingsway, London. In 1910 George Bell &amp; Sons became a private limited company and Edward and Ernest became directors. Ernest had followed his brother to Trinity College, Cambridge, and into the firm in 1874. He was an advocate of vegetarianism and contributed several books on the subject to the firm's list, including <span class="italic">In a Nutshell: Cons and Pros of the Meatless Diet</span> (1920). He was a passionate defender of animal rights, writing for the <span class="italic">Animal's Friend</span> and the Humanitarian League. In 1911 he was joined by another member of the family, Kenneth Norman Bell (1884&#150;1951), grandson of the founder of the firm, who had returned from Toronto, where he had been a lecturer at the university, to take an active part in the business. In 1913 Kenneth was elected a director of the firm. Though after the First World War he resumed his academic career and became a tutor at Balliol College, Oxford, he continued his editorial interest in the company. After Edward's death Ernest Bell succeeded as chairman of the company and Edward's son, Colonel Arthur Hugh Bell, joined the board.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_66130"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Hugh Bell</span>  (1878&#150;1968)<span class="occ"></span> was born at 4 Fellows Road, Hampstead, London, on 16 April 1878. He was educated at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On 10 October 1905 he married Gabrielle (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), daughter of James Kennedy. Bell's early career was in the Royal Engineers, and he served in the South African War from 1900 to 1902 and in the First World War from 1915 to 1916, when he was wounded. In 1917 and again in 1919&#150;20 he was in India on the north-west frontier, Waziristan, and he served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919. He was appointed DSO (1916) and OBE (1919). He was posted to southern Ireland during the Anglo-Irish War (1920&#150;21) and to Turkey in 1922&#150;3, during the Chanak crisis. Bell retired from the army in 1928 to take a more active role in his father's company, becoming chairman in 1936. He continued to develop the firm's educational list, as conditions following the Second World War had created a need for new books and a new approach. Bell was also an expert on dowsing. In addition to a number of articles which he published in a military journal, he translated four French books on the subject and was the editor of <span class="italic">Practical Dowsing</span> (1965). Arthur Hugh Bell died at his home, the Old Vicarage, Cuckfield, Sussex, on 21 February 1968.<br>
<br>In 1977, on retiring as chairman, Richard Glanville, great-grandson of the founder, sold the list to Robin Hyman. The company, renamed Bell and Hyman Ltd, merged with Allen and Unwin in July 1986 to form Unwin Hyman. The Bell and Hyman imprint thus disappeared and in 1990 Unwin Hyman was sold to HarperCollins.<br>
