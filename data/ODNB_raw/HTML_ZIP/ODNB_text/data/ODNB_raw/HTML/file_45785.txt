<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martindale,  Louisa</span>  (1872&#150;1966), <span class="occ">gynaecologist and suffragist</span>, the elder daughter of William Martindale (1833/4&#150;<i>c</i>.1874), a City of London businessman, and Louisa Spicer [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56459/', "Martindale, Louisa (1839&#150;1914)")</script>], his second wife, was born at Gainsborough Lodge, Leytonstone, London, on 30 October 1872. Her father was an evangelical Anglican, her mother a Congregationalist. Louisa Spicer came from a large family who combined evangelical Christianity with social reform, Liberal politics, charitable works, homoeopathy, and a love of travel. William Martindale died in his early forties when Louisa was three, leaving four children from his first marriage and Mrs Martindale pregnant with Hilda. Two infant children of the marriage had died in the same week as their father.<br>
<br>After her father's death Louisa Martindale lived first in Penzance before moving to Thuringia in Germany in 1877, where she and Hilda attended a kindergarten run by Fr&auml;ulein Trabert, a pupil of Froebel. In 1879 the family moved to Switzerland, to a village near Vevey overlooking Lake Geneva, and in 1880 to Lewes in Sussex. Here Louisa Spicer Martindale revealed her progressive ideas about the upbringing of Louisa and Hilda: she converted stables into a gymnasium, paid a gymnastics teacher, gave them bicycles, and had them taught to ride horses astride rather than side-saddle.<br>
<br>In 1885 Mrs Martindale moved into Brighton so that Louisa and Hilda could attend the Brighton High School for Girls, a Girls' Public Day School Company school opened in 1876. The girls were escorted to and from school by a governess to ensure that they were both chaperoned and educated on the journey. Mrs Martindale had open house on alternate Saturdays for German governesses working in Brighton, and for shop assistants. The latter group included Margaret Bondfield, later the first woman cabinet minister, then sixteen.<br>
<br>Louisa Martindale attended Royal Holloway College (1890&#150;92), and then the London School of Medicine for Women. She graduated with her MB (London) and BS (London) in 1899. After a brief spell as locum for Dr Mary Murdoch in Hull, Louisa, Hilda, and their mother spent a year travelling around the world. Louisa visited hospitals in Vienna, India, Australia, and the USA. From 1901 to 1906 she was in partnership with Dr Murdoch in Hull, a period which included three months' further study in Vienna. Louisa Martindale left Hull to do postgraduate work in Berlin and London, took the London MD in 1906, and then set up a private practice in Brighton. Here one vital source of income was retainers as medical officer at local girls' schools, including Roedean and the Brighton High School for Girls. Once qualified Louisa Martindale was active in four ways: as a medical woman who worked to open women's hospitals and to promote the interests of women in the profession at home and overseas, as a pioneer of radium therapy, in the governance of the medical profession, and as a feminist and suffragist.<br>
<br>While Louisa Martindale was in private practice in Marlborough Place, Brighton, she joined the staff of the Brighton Dispensary for Women and Children founded by her mother and Dr Helen Boyle. Fund-raising to open a general hospital for women staffed by women went on in Brighton from 1893, and the Brighton Dispensary gradually expanded to become the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children. When the New Sussex Hospital, Windlesham Road, was opened free of debt by Lady Astor in 1921 it became one of five general women's hospitals in Britain. Supporters included Elizabeth Robins and Octavia Wilberforce. Martindale became the senior surgeon in 1911; her professional colleagues were leading women pioneers in medicine including Louisa Aldrich Blake, Helen Scatliff, and Gladys Wauchope. In 1913, when the British Medical Association met for its annual conference in Brighton, she was the honorary secretary of the obstetrics and gynaecology section. During the First World War she remained in Brighton, but spent her holidays with the Scottish Women's Hospital at Abbey de Royaumont in France.<br>
<br>In 1923 Martindale moved to London and set up a private practice there, although she continued to operate at the New Sussex Hospital, as well as the East Grinstead Hospital. She was active in the work of the British Medical Women's Federation, serving as its president in 1931. She was also instrumental in establishing the Medical Women's International Association after its foundation meeting in 1919 in New York, serving as honorary secretary from 1924 to 1929, and then as honorary treasurer. She was president from 1937 to 1947. In 1921 she gave the inaugural address at the Royal Free School of Medicine for Women, which led to the publication of <span class="italic">The Woman Doctor and her Future</span> (1922). Working with Christine Murrell, Martindale also ensured that the British Postgraduate Medical School was open to women from its inception in 1931, and she became its first woman governor. In 1924 Martindale was a guest of honour at the American Medical Association's annual convention in Chicago. In 1933 she was made a fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and became the only woman on the council in 1934 when she was co-opted. In her autobiography she claimed to have performed more than 7000 operations.<br>
<br>Martindale was a pioneer of radium treatment for uterine and ovarian cancer in Britain. She had seen the work of Gauss and Kronig in Freiburg in 1913, and after 1921 she worked with Helen Chambers (a pathologist) and Elizabeth Hurdon (a physicist) implanting small amounts of radium surgically in cancerous organs. The trio were the Medical Women's Federation team in the Medical Research Council trials of radium therapy, their radium funded by the Medical Research Council and the King Edward's Hospital Fund. Operating at four women's hospitals the trio collaborated on 300 implants. Chambers and Martindale were on the committee that raised funds to open the Marie Curie Hospital specializing in women's cancers in 1929. As well as the innovative treatment the medical women conducted long-term follow-ups of patients, eventually producing epidemiological data on 13,800 patients.<br>
<br>Martindale held to the feminist position common in the nineteenth century that women were morally superior to men, and should exhort men to abstain from sex outside marriage and practise restraint within it. She opposed family planning (&#145;conception control&#146;) and campaigned against prostitution. Martindale was involved in suffrage campaigning in Hull and Brighton, and she was briefly on the national executive of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She was not a militant, but did shelter a fellow campaigner being sought by the police under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse&#146;</span>. Her social circle included the Fawcetts, and it was at Millicent Fawcett's urging that Martindale became embroiled in a public controversy. Martindale published a small volume on the evils of prostitution, <span class="italic">Under the Surface</span>, written from a feminist perspective. Anti-suffrage peers tried to get the book banned for obscenity in 1908. Martindale had focused on the links between prostitution and venereal diseases with explicit details of the medical symptoms. The book argued that enfranchising women would lead to national moral uplift, because women's greater moral sensibility would generate legislation on purity issues, and that sexual equality including equal pay would cause prostitution to wither away.<br>
<br>Louisa Martindale's personal life was women centred. Her autobiography reports little contact with her older half-siblings, in contrast to her close relationship with Hilda, her full sister. After the death of her mother in 1914, and of Dr Murdoch in 1916, Louisa's main adult relationship was with the Hon. Ismay Fitzgerald (1872&#150;1946) who lived with her from 1911 until her death. Ismay Fitzgerald was the daughter of John David, Lord Fitzgerald of Kilmarnock, an Irish judge, and Jane Mary Matilda Southwell. One of the baron's thirteen children, she was a devout Roman Catholic and loved horses. The two women entertained and visited Ismay's aristocratic relatives and often travelled in Italy, on one occasion having an audience with the pope. After leaving Brighton, Louisa and Ismay lived at Colin Godman's House in Chelwood Gate, Sussex, at Weymouth Street, London, and later at Little Rystwood, Forest Row, East Grinstead, Sussex, and in Manchester Square, London. Martindale's obituaries describe her as small, always beautifully dressed and shod in the current fashion, and fond of parties and entertaining. A dog lover, her memoir devotes a chapter to her pets.<br>
<br>Louisa Martindale was one of the first women JPs in Brighton (from 1924) and was later a JP in East Grinstead. Created a CBE in 1931, she retired in 1947, and published her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Woman Surgeon</span>, in 1951. In her old age she became blind. She died on 5 February 1966 at her home, 14 Avenue Lodge, Avenue Road, St John's Wood, London.<br>
