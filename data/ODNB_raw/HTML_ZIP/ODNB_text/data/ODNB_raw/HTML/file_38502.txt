<span class="headword">Aethelwig</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1077/8), <span class="occ">abbot of Evesham and administrator</span>, was the son of an otherwise little-known thegn named Ordwig. Claims made in Thomas of Marlborough's <span class="italic">History of the Abbey of Evesham</span>, that he was a man &#145;of great nobility of family&#146;  (Sayers and Watkiss, 161), are almost certainly false. It is unknown when or at what age Aethelwig became a monk. The principal Worcester sources agree that he was skilled in secular business and the law, and even before he became abbot he was entrusted with great responsibility by his superiors. His duties included administration of the diocese of Worcester for Bishop Ealdred, perhaps while Ealdred was in Germany in 1054. As prior of Evesham under Abbot Manning (1044&#150;58), Aethelwig began extending the abbey's holdings. Whether this was the reclamation of unjustly lost estates or territorial aggrandizement remains largely a matter of perspective. In 1058, suffering from a paralysing disease, the incapacitated abbot nominated Aethelwig as his successor and sent him to King Edward, in whose presence Aethelwig was consecrated by Bishop Ealdred at Gloucester on 23 April.<br>
<br>According to Thomas of Marlborough, Aethelwig immediately became one of Edward's closest councillors, and continued to exert influence over Harold II. Although this is otherwise unattested in narrative or documentary sources, such a role is not implausible. When Ealdred left Worcester for York in 1062, Aethelwig was considered a possible replacement. He lobbied hard for the appointment, and his administrative skills made him a strong candidate, but the bishopric eluded him. Unfortunately for Aethelwig, the papal legates sent to decide on the matter were looked after by the cathedral prior, Wulfstan, who entertained them on a lavish scale while maintaining a display of heroic asceticism. Archbishops Ealdred and Stigand, the legates, and earls Harold and Aelfgar all came to support Wulfstan's candidacy and &#145;the prudent stratagem of man gave way to the providence of God&#146;  (Darlington, <span class="italic">Vita Wulfstani</span>, 47).<br>
<br>Although Aethelwig's abilities failed to win him a diocese in the age of the Gregorian reform movement, they were recognized by William the Conqueror, who was anxious to use English clergy as a means of stabilizing the English west midlands. Aethelwig acted quickly after Hastings to recognize the new king and offer his services, which were so far accepted that he was given authority over Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire, and remained <i>de facto</i> justiciar over this great swathe of England, constituting almost the whole of Mercia excepting Cheshire, until his death a decade later. As a result, Evesham, like Worcester, was partially protected against Norman domination, at least while Aethelwig and Wulfstan lived. Indeed, while other churches struggled to preserve their endowments, Evesham's rapid territorial expansion continued. Many estates were acquired at the expense of Worcester, and Wulfstan's biographer Hemming, who excoriated Aethelwig's appropriations, was forced to acknowledge his power. The abbot launched a campaign of lawsuits against Wulfstan, and the decimation of the old nobility, coupled with Aethelwig's local pre-eminence, expertise, and family connections, allowed him to seduce many of the bishop of Worcester's vassals into his own service, greatly extending Evesham's lands. A royal writ commanding Aethelwig and Thorkell (another English survivor) to protect the lands of Westminster Abbey at Perton (Staffordshire) shows that even before the revolt of 1069&#150;70 Aethelwig had assumed some of Eadwine's functions as earl of Mercia, and his attestations place him at the king's side at least twice in the early post-conquest years.<br>
<br>The most famous evidence for Aethelwig's secular and military importance in these years is a writ of military summons in which King William required the abbot to summon &#145;all those who are in your bailiwick and jurisdiction that they have all the knights which they owe me duly equipped&#146;, and commanded him to attend in person with the five knights of Evesham's <i>servitium debitum</i>  (Bates, no. 131). Its trustworthiness is uncertain, but this document has long been central to the discussion of the early military obligations of Anglo-Norman tenants-in-chief. If genuine, it is the earliest surviving writ of military summons and as such an important part of the military history of the period.<br>
<br>Aethelwig was not directly involved in the suppression of the northern revolt that erupted in 1069, but he responded impressively to its aftermath. Thomas of Marlborough recorded how with his customary efficiency Aethelwig handled the provision of &#145;disaster relief&#146; for the refugees who trudged to the monastery in search of food and protection, dividing the task of caring for child refugees among his monks and servants. Even so, five or six refugees, including many children, died daily at the abbey at the height of the crisis. According to John of Worcester, Aethelwig played a far more dynamic role in the suppression of the revolt of the earls in 1075, when together with Wulfstan, Walter de Lacy, and Sheriff Urse of Worcester he led an army that prevented Roger de Breteuil, earl of Hereford, from crossing the River Severn and joining forces with Earl Ralph. The latter lost his nerve, and one of the most dangerous rebellions of the early Anglo-Norman period collapsed.<br>
<br>While extending his secular power, Aethelwig was equally effective at fostering the growth of his abbey. Under his leadership, a community of twelve monks grew to contain thirty-six. He built a new chapel dedicated to the increasingly fashionable St Nicholas, and the monastery received many pilgrims, notably overseas visitors from Aquitaine and Ireland. Although Aethelwig himself was not regarded as a saint, even at Evesham, Marlborough's <span class="italic">History</span> places heavy emphasis on his extensive charity towards visitors, the poor, and his brethren. At a more secular level, he lent his money and his legal expertise to help Bishop Wulfstan see off the attempt of Thomas of Bayeux (who succeeded Ealdred as archbishop of York) to subject his diocese to York in 1071, and &#145;as both judge and witness&#146; helped Lanfranc to recover some alienated Canterbury lands. He also lent money to the poverty-stricken Abbot Serlo of Glastonbury. He oversaw the monastery of Winchcombe after the imprisonment in 1066 of Abbot Godric (who was eventually moved to Aethelwig's keeping), and again after the death of Abbot Galandus in 1075.<br>
<br>Aethelwig also played a role in the re-establishment of monastic life in Northumbria, in what can be construed as a revival of Anglo-Saxon observance far from the centres of Norman power. About 1073&#150;4 Prior Aldwin of Winchcombe undertook to restore the monastic observance in the north and attracted two Evesham monks to the project. Aethelwig appointed Aldwin to be abbot of a new community, which with the assistance of Bishop Walcher of Durham occupied and restored the ruins of Bede's old monastery at Wearmouth&#150;Jarrow, and which in turn supplied a new cathedral chapter at Durham with monks. About the same time one of the Evesham monks, Reinfrid, founded what became Whitby Abbey, which in turn became the mother house for St Mary's Abbey at York. Aethelwig may also have contributed to the short-lived establishment of a Benedictine community to serve Dublin Cathedral in the late eleventh century, since some of the monks came from Winchcombe.<br>
<br>Aethelwig was present at the Council of Winchester/Windsor of 1072, where he witnessed the agreement over the primacy between Canterbury and York, and he also attended the Council of London in 1075. His last datable act, in 1077, was to take Evesham into a confraternity organized by Wulfstan with other abbots of western England and the dean of Worcester, which has been seen as an attempt by Aethelwig and Wulfstan to lock key elements of Anglo-Saxon observance into the monasteries of the region before the Norman takeover of the English church there was complete.<br>
<br>By then Aethelwig had long suffered frequent attacks of gout. Marlborough records that &#145;Worn out by this affliction for a considerable time before his end, he finally departed this mortal life on 16th February &hellip; at a good age&#146;  (Sayers and Watkiss, 175). The year in question was 1077, according to Marlborough, but this may mean 1078, depending on the dating system used. Aethelwig left behind a community considerably richer than the one he had inherited and three times its size. He also left a great sum of money, no less than &#145;five casks of silver&#146;  (ibid.), for a planned reconstruction of the ancient abbey church, a task that was undertaken with great enthusiasm by his successor, Abbot Walter. Only minuscule fragments of the Norman church survive, however, though its plan has been established by excavations.<br>
<br>Though the community at Evesham continued to thrive, Aethelwig's agglomeration of estates unravelled quickly. Wulfstan, who was no longer overshadowed by the astute abbot, reasserted himself to recover some of Worcester's estates, while other properties passed into the hands of Odo of Bayeux and Urse d'Abetot. At Evesham this was seen as an attack on the monastery after the death of its formidable leader, but it is possible that the estates that Aethelwig gained were personal rewards for royal service, to which the abbey had no right after his death. He may, however, have left a more durable legacy in English government, for it has been suggested that the &#145;Shires of the Mercian law&#146; first attested in the early twelfth-century <span class="italic">Leges Henrici Primi</span> may represent a continuance of Aethelwig's jurisdiction.<br>
