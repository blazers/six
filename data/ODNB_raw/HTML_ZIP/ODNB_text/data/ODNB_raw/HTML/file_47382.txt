<span class="headword">Beatson,  William Ferguson</span>  (1804&#150;1872), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 25 June 1804 at Rossend Castle, Fife, fourth and youngest son of Robert Beatson (1758&#150;1805), lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, FRSE, and writer on windmills, of Kilrie and his wife, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1816), only child and heiress of Murdoch Campbell of Rossend. He entered the East India Company's service in 1820 and joined the 2nd battalion 25th Bengal native infantry as an ensign. He served in several different regiments of the Bengal native army and was promoted lieutenant (1823), captain (1837), major (1848), lieutenant-colonel (1853), colonel (1864), and major-general (1865). He distinguished himself as a soldier and was a particularly fine horseman, unusually so for an infantry officer. While on furlough from India in 1832&#150;7, he served with permission in the British Legion, raised and commanded by Colonel De Lacy Evans, to fight for Queen Isabella of Spain against Don Carlos in the first Carlist War (1835&#150;6). Beatson commanded the 10th infantry regiment, or Munster light infantry, at the head of which he was severely wounded. He was awarded the cross of the Order of San Fernando for actions on 28 May and 6 July 1836, which he was subsequently permitted to wear.<br>
<br>On his return to India in 1837 Beatson was promoted captain and employed in Bundelkhand, central India, then in a very disturbed state. He raised a local force, the Bundelkhand Legion, with which he captured many forts and subdued recalcitrant rajas and bands of dacoits, receiving for his services the thanks of government. In 1844 he volunteered the Bundelkhand Legion for service in Sind under Napier, and was commended by the latter for the legion's successful operations in the Bugti hills. In 1847 he was appointed to command the nizam's cavalry in Hyderabad, where he remained until 1851 in the local rank of brigadier.<br>
<br>Beatson's reputation as a leader of irregular cavalry was such that on the outbreak of the Crimean War it was suggested that he should train a force of irregular Turkish cavalry. The Foreign Office offered his services to Omar Pasha, who commanded the Turkish forces on the Danube. He gave Beatson the rank of lieutenant-general in the Turkish army and command of a force of Turkish irregular cavalry, bashi-bazouks, about 4000 strong. They were mostly Albanians with a profound distaste for any form of military discipline, who wore their own native dress and were notorious for their brutality. These troops were rejected by Lord Raglan whose experience of irregulars during the Peninsular War had powerfully influenced him against them. Unpaid, the bashi-bazouks disbanded. Beatson was later awarded the gold medal of the imperial order, Nishan Iftikhar, by the sultan of Turkey for his service on the Danube.<br>
<br>When Raglan's army sailed for the Crimea, Beatson offered to waive his rank in order to serve on the staff of the Hon. James Scarlett who was commanding the heavy cavalry brigade. He thus took part in the charge of the heavy brigade at Balaklava on 25 October 1854. &#145;Colonel Beatson &hellip; gave me all the assistance which his experience and well-known gallantry enabled him to do throughout the day,&#146; reported Scarlett to the military secretary at the Horse Guards in London  (Kinglake, 4.143). He recommended Beatson for recognition to Lord Lucan, commanding the cavalry division, but this was refused by Lucan.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1855 Beatson was deputed to raise a fresh levy of 4000 bashi-bazouks, paid and equipped by the British government. Dubbed &#145;Beatson's horse&#146;, their unruly behaviour in camp at the Dardanelles soon brought them into conflict with the Turkish authorities, one of the chief complainants being J. H. Skene, a British vice-consul. As a consequence Beatson was placed under Major-General Robert Vivian, commanding the Turkish contingent of regular troops in British pay. Vivian had him replaced in September 1855, after an armed stand-off between Beatson's command and the Turkish forces. After Beatson had returned to England Skene accused him of inciting his bashi-bazouks to mutiny against his supersession. This Beatson denied, and he brought an action against Skene to clear his name of the charge. The trial took place in January 1860 and cost Beatson &pound;3000. Although the jury found for Skene on purely legal grounds, they went on to censure him for failing to withdraw his statements after he had discovered that they were unfounded. Beatson might therefore claim a moral victory, albeit at considerable expense.<br>
<br>Beatson had been promoted lieutenant-colonel in November 1853 and returned to India when the mutiny broke out in 1857. His services in the mutiny were confined to central India where he raised two regiments of irregular cavalry&#151;the 1st and 2nd Beatson's Horse. He dressed them in green with red turbans and cummerbunds, mounting the 1st regiment on stallions, and the 2nd on mares and a few geldings. They took part in the pursuit of the rebel commanders, Tantia Topi and the rani of Jhansi. One of their officers, Lieutenant Evelyn Wood, won the VC when commanding the 1st Beatson's Horse on 28 December 1859 (Beatson, by then a local brigadier-general, having relinquished command in September 1859). On 16 April 1860 his regiment was joined with Mayne's Horse to form the Central India Horse.<br>
<br>Beatson was promoted major-general on 8 January 1865 to command the Allahabad division. &#145;Handsome in appearance, and dignified in bearing, he was a soldier of the austere and earnest type,&#146; records the history of the Central India Horse  (Watson, 46). &#145;He lived camp fashion, and very uncomfortably too. He was on horse back every morning before day-break, and, in order to be prepared for emergencies, he rode invariably with a supply of biscuits and sultanas in his wallets&#146;  (ibid.). He commanded in Allahabad from 1866 to 1869, and the Ambala division from 1869 until he returned home on leave in 1872. He died suddenly at the vicarage, New Swindon, Wiltshire, on 4 February 1872, aged sixty-eight.<br>
<br>Beatson married on 12 February 1840 Margaret Marian Humfrays (or Humphreys), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Humfrays of the Bengal Engineers. She died on 22 December 1866, at Allahabad, soon after Beatson took command there. They had two daughters, one of whom, Mrs McMullin, survived him.<br>
