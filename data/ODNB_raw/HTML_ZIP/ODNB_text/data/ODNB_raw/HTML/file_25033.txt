<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Segar, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1633), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25031/', "Francis Seagar (Segar)")</script> and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sherard. William had two siblings: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109694/', "Francis Segar")</script>, gentleman of the bedchamber to Maurice, landgrave of Hesse, and Jane, who authored, in 1589, &#145;The divine prophesies of the ten sibills&#146;, a bound manuscript intended for Queen Elizabeth. William's precise date of birth is unknown; however, in a deposition in September 1604 he gave his age as &#145;fifty or thereabouts&#146;  (Borukhov, 328). Admitted to Gray's Inn in 1579, Segar, who was trained as a scrivener, was employed by Sir Thomas Heneage, who introduced him to the College of Arms. Segar was created Portcullis pursuivant on 10 June 1585, Somerset herald on 4 February 1589, and Norroy king of arms on 23 October 1597, though the patent was not signed until 2 June 1602  (Noble, 172). On 23 April 1586 he attended the earl of Leicester's festival of St George at Utrecht and later made several voyages abroad, writing accounts not only of the Utrecht journey but also of his sojourns in France (1596) and Denmark (1603). On 16 February 1587, Segar and other heralds carried Sir Philip Sidney's hatchments in his funeral procession.<br>
<br>At this time, Robert Cooke, Clarenceux king of arms, was encroaching on the traditional privileges of Garter king of arms. In 1595 Segar sided with Sir William Dethick, Garter, criticizing Cooke for his inability to write clearly and for making many grants of arms to &#145;base and unworthy persons for his private gaine onely&#146;  (Wagner, 207). In 1596 he continued to uphold Garter's rights against Cooke's successor, Richard Lee. Segar was appointed deputy Garter in place of the unpopular Dethick to invest Christian IV of Denmark with the Garter in June 1603. In 1604 he proclaimed the Anglo-Spanish peace in London. He was appointed as Garter by a signet bill in January 1604, although Dethick did not resign until December 1606. Segar obtained a great seal patent, confirming him as Garter, on 17 January 1607. In 1612 he invested Maurice, prince of Orange, with the Garter, and the same year was himself granted arms  (BL, Harl. MS 1441, fol. 154b). He was knighted on 5 November 1616.<br>
<br>By 1584 Segar had married first Helen Somers (<i>d</i>. 1593&times;6) of Kent, and had three sons, Jacob, Giles (<i>d</i>. 1649), and Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1586), and three daughters, Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1585), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1592), and Penelope, who married first Nicholas Charles (<i>d</i>. 1613), Lancaster herald, and then Timothy Cartwright of Marshbone, Gloucestershire, with whom she had Timothy Cartwright, builder of the Royal Exchange. By 1596 Segar had married Mary (Maria), daughter of Robert Browne of Evington, Herefordshire, and had four sons, John (<i>b</i>. 1596), who died in Virginia, Frederick (<i>b</i>. 1599), William (<i>b</i>. 1604), and Thomas (1607&#150;1670), later Bluemantle pursuivant of arms, and three daughters, Ann, later wife of Lewis Latham of Ellonstow, Bedfordshire, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1601), and Alice (<i>b</i>. 1603). In December 1616 Segar's rival Ralph Brooke, York herald, tricked him into confirming a concoction of foreign royal arms to Gregory Brandon, the common hangman of London who was masquerading as a gentleman about to embark for the continent. Brooke then reported him to James I, who imprisoned both Brooke and Segar in Marshalsea prison on 30 December 1616. They were released a few days later, the lord chamberlain hoping the experience would make the former more honest and the latter more wise  (Wagner, 219&#150;20).<br>
<br>On 5 April 1617, James I added &pound;10 to the existing &pound;50 paid to Segar's office of Garter. The same year, he and William Camden conducted the heraldic visitation of Northamptonshire. On 16 November 1618 Segar became one of the commissioners to inquire into the condition of Lincoln's Inn Fields. In 1624 he was among those recommended by Edmond Bolton to be members of the projected Academy Royal. In 1627, accompanied by two of his sons, he and Dudley, Lord Carleton, visited The Hague to invest Henry Frederick, prince of Orange, with the Garter. He was represented by Henry St George for the investment of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden the same year, and by Phillipot for the investment of the elector Charles Louis of the Palatine in 1633.<br>
<br>Segar is known to have been the author of a number of manuscript and printed works. His poetry includes a volume of satiric anti-Catholic poems (1587), poems praising James I and others in tribute to friends, and Latin and French poems that he &#145;englished&#146;  (Borukhov, 329). His prose works are on such subjects as the arms of the Garter knights, the office of earl marshal, the origins of the princely orders of collars, and the heraldry and genealogy of the English royal family and peerage. Best known for his <span class="italic">Honor, Military and Civill</span> (1602), Segar is associated with other works as well. &#145;Segar's Roll&#146; of armorial bearings  (BL, Add. MS 8933), a treatise on heraldry, is so called because it was in his custody in 1605; <span class="italic">The Cities Great Concern</span> (1629), sometimes attributed to him, was really by Edmond Bolton. Segar was a conscientious herald and a formidable scholar yet, like many other Tudor genealogists, he authorized many pedigrees giving most improbable descents from fabulous ancestors. His long reign gave the college respite from the jealous controversies over the prerogatives of the three kings of arms.<br>
<br>Segar was also a painter of significance. In 1598, Francis Meres, in <span class="italic">Palladis Tamia Wits Treasury</span>, judged &#145;William and Francis Segar brethren&#146; among the leading painters in England. Some twenty portraits by Segar are known, including those of Robert Dudley, first earl of Leicester, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, Sir Francis Drake, and Queen Elizabeth  (Piper, 300).<br>
<br>Segar wrote his will on 10 December 1633, describing himself as being of Richmond, Surrey, and appointing Sir John Parsons his overseer. He died the same day and was buried the next in the chancel of Richmond parish church, Surrey. His will was proved on 21 January 1634 by his widow and executor, Maria. On 3 June 1649 administration of the estate was granted to his son Thomas, after Mary's death. Thomas Segar's son was the indexer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109695/', "Simon Segar the elder")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109694/', "Segar, Francis, the younger")</script>], who was the father of the author and genealogist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25032/', "Simon Segar the younger")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109694/', "Segar, Francis, the younger")</script>].<br>
