<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kidder,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was born at East Grinstead, Sussex, where he was baptized on 9 February 1634, the eighth of nine children of William Kidder, an impoverished member of the lesser gentry, and his wife, Elsabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1648), remembered by her son as a woman of great puritan piety.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>After receiving a basic early education from a local gentlewoman Kidder went to the local grammar school where he was taught &#145;without reward&#146; by a Dutchman, a royalist in Anglican orders, Reyner Herman from Nijmegen  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2). Kidder later claimed that he owed much to the education he had received from Herman in Latin, Greek, religious principles, and generosity to the poor. Though sufficiently prepared for entry to university, Kidder had insufficient means, and initially trained as an apothecary at Sevenoaks. Nevertheless friends raised money for him and he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar in June 1649. Here one of the fellows, Samuel Cradock, a noted presbyterian divine, taught him, encouraged him in the religious life, and supplied him with money to finish the course; Kidder later wrote, &#145;'tis hardly possible that one man can owe to another more than I do to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 4). Kidder graduated BA in 1652, but, still without money, left the university, only to be elected a fellow at Emmanuel three years later. Several men who were fellow bishops with him in the 1690s, including John Tillotson, Thomas Tenison, and Simon Patrick, were then at Cambridge; one, James Gardiner, bishop of Lincoln from 1695 to 1705, was also at Emmanuel. Kidder proceeded MA in 1656.<br>
<br>Despite his presbyterian ambience, and despite Cradock's profound influence, Kidder made a clear decision to reject presbyterian ordination and seek Anglican orders, despite the risk of personal disadvantage. In November 1658 Ralph Brownrigg, the deprived bishop of Exeter, ordained him both deacon and priest in one day at a private house in Bury St Edmunds. In 1659 Kidder was appointed to the college living of Stanground, Huntingdonshire. Despite his later protestations that as far as possible he used prayers agreeable to Anglicanism, he must also have conformed to the Westminster directory. Though he declared he had good orders and title, had never taken the covenant, and was &#145;entirely satisfied in episcopacy and with a liturgy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 11) he refused to subscribe to the newly amended prayer book of 1662 until he had seen it. It did not appear until three weeks after the date required for his conformity, and he was deprived of his living.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Kidder stayed in the parish, attending the church and preaching in London and the countryside. Without a living and with a young family, following his marriage to his wife, Elisabeth, he was indigent. By 1664 he had conformed, and Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, appointed him to the rectory of Rayne, Essex. Whereas the people at Stanground were &#145;modest and teachable&#146;, here they were &#145;factious to the greatest degree &hellip; such despisers they were of the Common Prayer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span> 14). In his sermons twice on each Sunday, later published in <span class="italic">Convivium coeleste</span>, he encouraged them to attend holy communion frequently. Afterwards he called those years the &#145;lost part of [his] life&#146;  (ibid.). Here he published <span class="italic">A Young Man's Duty</span> (1671), so popular that by 1750 it had run to ten editions, and he contributed an appendix of Hebrew proverbs to a collection by his friend John Ray, the botanist (1670). The plague of 1665, bringing many deaths in the village, added to his troubles. Though his own house was infected and isolated and his wife, Elisabeth, smitten, his whole family, including her, survived, and yet all three of his children died soon afterwards from other causes. In 1674 William Sancroft, then dean of St Paul's, offered him the living of St Helen, Bishopsgate, with its huge church and large congregations of well-to-do people. Though he later recorded, &#145;I would rather have continued minister of St Helen's than gain an archbishopric&#146;  (ibid., 19), he served there only briefly. He refused to be instituted, partly for reasons of health, but mainly because, unlike in his other livings, many &#145;devout and regular&#146; parishioners of puritan persuasion refused to kneel to receive communion, in breach of canon law. Kidder was unwilling to enforce this demand and thus &#145;send them to the Nonconformists&#146;  (Cassan, 2.123).<h2>
<a name="StMartinOutwichLondon"></a>St Martin Outwich, London</h2>In 1674 Kidder was appointed preacher at the Rolls, which gave him an income, and by the patronage of the Merchant Taylors' Company he was instituted to the small, impoverished parish of St Martin Outwich, next door to the lucrative St Helen's. Despite the poor St Martin's stipend he refused dispensation to hold it in plurality with his rectory at Rayne. This he now resigned. Consequently once his Rolls post unexpectedly ended after only four terms he was again in poverty. This, however, was partly relieved by his acting as tutor to Sir William Dawes, later archbishop of York, and George Harbin, the future nonjuror and friend of Thomas Ken, until they went to university. Kidder now joined London's exceptionally gifted clerical circle; the future archbishops Tillotson, Tenison, Wake, and Sharp were fellow incumbents. Many were part of the moderate group connected with Daniel Finch, later second earl of Nottingham. Their spirituality, scholarship, and pastoral care provided &#145;a luminous interlude&#146;, &#145;a small awakening&#146; in the church  (Rupp, 51). The intense spirituality of Kidder's friend Anthony Horneck had a powerful influence on him. It was in this period that gout first struck Kidder; it was to remain his unwelcome companion for life. So painful was it that he soon had to preach kneeling. In 1680 tragedy struck again; another three of his children, including two favourite sons already at Merchant Taylors' School, died, this time from smallpox, a blow which &#145;laid [Kidder] very low&#146;  (Cassan, 2.131). In the parish he catechized zealously to enable parishioners not just to learn but also to understand. He published a little catechism, held frequent communions, and spent much time visiting the poor. Though work was hard it was for him &#145;the most comfortable and easy part of my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 35).<br>
<br>Kidder was now a popular preacher, and increasingly his sermons were printed. The governors of Christ's Hospital entrusted him with the task of examining its condition, his report revealing serious shortcomings. Furthermore, Heneage Finch, first earl of Nottingham, the lord chancellor, had presented him to a prebend of Norwich (1681), which alleviated his poverty. Yet in the 1680s he declined other income producing appointments, including a lectureship in Ipswich twice, a lucrative living in Kent offered by Archbishop Sancroft, and one in Barnes by John Tillotson, dean of St Paul's. Meanwhile, his writing continued, initially with works of pastoral concern, <span class="italic">Charity Directed</span> (1676), <span class="italic">Discourse on the Christian Sufferer Supported</span> (1680), and a second edition of <span class="italic">Convivium coeleste</span> with prayers (1684). These were followed by <span class="italic">A Demonstration of the Messias</span> (1684), a more academic work aimed at Jews and deists. He also participated in a translation into Latin of the works of John Lightfoot, the great Hebraist, which became &#145;a long and painful employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 37).<br>
<br>In James II's reign Kidder entered the controversy provoked by the Catholicizing policies, preaching, for instance, against popery on several occasions before the mayor of London. When he perceived the papist tide seeming to threaten Norwich, Kidder was there working hard distributing his books and leaflets. His writings also reflect the time. In 1687 he contributed <span class="italic">The Thirteenth Note, on the Confession of Adversaries</span> in a reply, with others, to Bellarmine's century-old fifteen notes of the true church. This he followed with <span class="italic">A Second Dialogue between a New Catholic Convert and a Protestant</span> (1687). His <span class="italic">Reflections on a French Testament of 1686</span> was published only in 1690 after the revolution. During the turbulent period after Archbishop Sancroft and six bishops had been imprisoned, tried for seditious libel, acquitted, then released, one of them, William Lloyd of St Asaph, stayed secretly with him for several weeks.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionandpreferment"></a>Revolution and preferment</h2>In 1689, after the accession of William and Mary, Kidder was appointed royal chaplain. As part of Nottingham's group of moderate clergy, he was appointed to the commission set up by William III to review the liturgy and canons for the possible comprehension of dissenters. His particular role was to examine the translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. His meticulous written analysis of the psalter, comparing the original Hebrew with the current version, displayed both his skill as a Hebraist and his natural scholarly qualities. Unfortunately the commission had no time to examine it and it bore no immediate fruit. Nevertheless preferment was once again on the horizon. Even so, again on health grounds he refused a prestigious and wealthy offer, this time of St Paul's, Covent Garden. In 1689, however, when Nottingham recommended him for the deanery of Peterborough, he immediately accepted. Installed in person he clearly found the role rewarding. He was in residence each summer, presiding at chapter meetings; he ordered an annual chapter inspection of the school, and kept good hospitality, living &#145;in very great peace with the prebendaries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 60). In 1690 he was created DD at Cambridge by royal mandate.<br>
<br>In the following year Tillotson, now archbishop of Canterbury, with considerable lack of sensitivity, recommended Kidder for the see of Peterborough in succession to his own bishop, Thomas White, who had been deprived as a nonjuror. Kidder bluntly refused, and further made it known that he would decline all others, especially Bath and Wells where Thomas Ken had been deprived. Meanwhile, however, William Beveridge had refused that see, and in a confusion of messages, Kidder found it offered to himself by royal command. After a few days' delay he accepted and was appointed, but soon regretted it. &#145;I should not have done it were it to do again. I did not consult my ease&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 63). He knew he had a hard act to follow, for the saintly Ken was popular in the diocese and turned out to be resentful of Kidder's intrusion. Tillotson consecrated Kidder as bishop in St Mary-le-Bow Church on 30 August 1691. He was enthroned in person at Wells in September, but returned to Westminster to take the oaths in the Lords on 31 October.<h2>
<a name="BishopofBathandWells"></a>Bishop of Bath and Wells</h2>Kidder entered his episcopate with the best of intentions. Despite his poor health he was stubbornly conscientious, rejected the quiet life, and, in common with other new bishops of the 1690s, set about the reform of the diocese. He returned to Wells in May 1692 for his first ordination, only to be so gout stricken that he had to be carried into the palace chapel. He recovered enough to start his primary visitation at Axbridge on 2 June, but in his charge he was characteristically brusque. He threatened suspension to clergy who failed to fulfil the marriage regulations; he further demanded an end to non-residence. &#145;An oath&#146;, he declared, &#145;is not to be trifled with&#146;  (<span class="italic">Charge</span>, 28&#150;31). By the end of his visitation his gout struck again, &#145;so violent that there was little hope of my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 65). In July he began his visitation of the cathedral and the college of vicars-choral, where he was immediately in conflict over non-residence.<br>
<br>Kidder ordained regularly. After his first ordination at Trinity 1692 he conferred orders at least twice a year, usually at Trinity and Michaelmas, sometimes in Advent. All ordinations except one, at St Alfege, London, were held within the diocese, usually in the palace chapel, occasionally in the cathedral or at Bath. Twice, in 1692 and 1693, much to the cathedral chapter's disgust, he conferred Anglican orders <i>extra tempora</i> (i.e. outside the traditional ember seasons), but after strict examination, on the talented former dissenters John Gardiner and Nicholas Malarr&eacute;. If this appeared lax to some he was, however, ruthless with forged orders, even chasing culprits into northern dioceses. He carried out regular triennial visitations of the diocese and cathedral. On his one recorded confirmation tour (1693) in which he congratulated incumbents for conscientious preparation, there were crowds at Bridgwater. He later joyfully recorded, &#145;I thought I had never done in my whole life a better day's work; I am sure a more painful and wearisome day I never spent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 82).<br>
<br>Despite these positive aspects Kidder's episcopate is sadly remembered more for his running battles with the clergy, especially the cathedral chapter who were supporters of Ken. The Creightons were dominant. Robert (the elder) had been dean and then bishop. His son, also Robert, was precentor, and indeed the whole body was little more than the Creighton family's &#145;genteel mafiosi&#146;  (Rupp, 501). Kidder immediately set to work. &#145;Corruptions&#146;, he warned, &#145;do not come in all at once and 'tis time to put a stop to them when they are grown to the height that now they are&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 124). But in his honest, vigorous confrontation over chapter elections he misjudged the situation. The cathedral clergy, already hostile to him as Ken's usurper, were increasingly antagonized and unco-operative.<br>
<br>Hence Kidder's ordination of the two former dissenters caused major convulsions. In one case two canons, Robert Creighton, the precentor, and Thomas Cheney, once Ken's chaplain, at first positively refused to assist, one initially threatening to leave the diocese rather than participate. Kidder was also at odds with Edwin Sandys, archdeacon of Wells, still one of Ken's close friends. Kidder even initially suspended him for not attending an ordination in 1697, a suspension Kidder had to lift on appeal. He had further trouble with other clergy, and also with laymen such as Harry Bridges, the Jacobite supporter of Ken. The Bridges affair ended in court at London Guildhall, where Kidder had to appear in person to wring an apology from him. Another antagonist was the local doctor, Claver Morris, who tried to court his daughter. Despite all this, as bishop Kidder continued to write, publishing <span class="italic">A Commentary upon the Five Books of Moses</span> (1694), designed for families, the brief <span class="italic">Life</span> (1697) of his friend Anthony Horneck the divine, and his <span class="italic">Messias Part II</span> (1699). He was Boyle lecturer in 1693. A pamphlet <span class="italic">On the Sins of Infirmity</span> went to the printers just before his death and was published posthumously (1704).<br>
<br>Not a political bishop, Kidder nevertheless regularly attended the Lords until April 1695, after which, as gout took its hold, his attendances grew increasingly spasmodic. Nevertheless, when the attainder of the Jacobite Sir John Fenwick was debated in the Lords in December 1696 Kidder attended the house. Along with eight other prelates, but unlike Archbishop Tenison, he voted against the attainder, and in January he registered his official protest against the proceedings. He attended frequently in the first year of Anne's reign, 1702, but only occasionally in 1703.<br>
<br>Since the late 1670s Kidder had been wracked by ill health. His gout, first appearing at St Martin's, gradually dominated his activities, especially as bishop. He was carried not only to his first ordination in 1692, but also to the Fenwick debates in the Lords in 1696. Increasingly from 1695 he had to winter in Wells, and in 1698 he was ill for twenty-five weeks. Yet he still continued to write in his clear meticulous hand helpful letters to friends outside the diocese. Despite complaints of mounting weakness in August 1702 it was not gout but the great storm of 26&#150;7 November 1703 that killed him. That night Kidder and his wife, Elisabeth, were tragically crushed to death by a chimney stack collapsing through the roof of the bishop's palace. They were buried in Wells Cathedral on 14 December. His wife, with whom Kidder had spent most of his adult life, and who had survived both plague in 1665 and smallpox in 1680, remains a shadowy figure. Two daughters survived them, one of whom, Anne, through her will of 1728, paid for his monument in the cathedral.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>A noted Hebraist and <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholar, vigorously publishing and preaching in the 1670s and 1680s, Kidder was also a fine, dedicated, and caring parish priest in Essex and London. He was also friendly with future nonjurors, including William Sancroft, Robert Nelson, and George Harbin. Once bishop, however, his fortune waned. Plagued by persistent ill health he had the misfortune of following Thomas Ken, the most saintly of the nonjurors, whose aura was still all pervasive. Indeed, living nearby, Ken was himself uncharacteristically bitter, dubbing Kidder &#145;latitudinarian traditour&#146; and after Kidder's death accusing him of not &#145;keeping the flock within the fold&#146; but even of encouraging them &#145;to stray&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.138). Furthermore, Ken's supporters permeated the diocese, none more intractable than the corrupt cathedral chapter and the archdeacon of Wells. Kidder himself was well aware of his sticky wicket. Taunted during Lords debates for not toeing the government line with &#145;Don't you know whose bread you are eating?&#146; he retorted briskly, &#145;I eat no bread but poor Dr. Ken's&#146;  (Noble, 2.101n.). When in 1702 Queen Anne offered Kidder translation to Carlisle to facilitate Ken's return, Kidder readily agreed, only to find that Ken rejected the scheme.<br>
<br>Despite this Kidder lacked the sensitivity, perhaps even the sense of humour, to cope with this unenviable situation. Even if he had been in good health he was perhaps temperamentally unsuited to any bishopric, let alone Ken's. Kidder's autobiographical work, verging on the paranoid in places, obsessively refers to the enemies ranged against him and wearily insists on the blamelessness of his own conduct. It is hard to conceive of either Ken or Kidder's successor, George Hooper, writing as he did. His earlier refusals of prestigious livings reveal perhaps that Kidder tended to shy away from heavier burdens, and that he may have been temperamentally unsuited for them. He clearly felt at ease with the Peterborough deanery with its quieter, more scholarly life. As intruder in Ken's see he faced an impossible situation, but his stubborn conscientiousness, his determination to root out corruption, and his confrontational style lacked the skilled diplomacy Hooper later successfully used to loosen the Creighton grip on the cathedral. Nonjurors might rejoice at Kidder's tragic death, but for him also it was perhaps a merciful release. &#145;A sad, scholarly man&#146;  (Rupp, 39), a tragic figure, having lost six children, dogged for years with agonizing ill health, now embattled and alienated in his diocese, he led a life that was far from happy. The traditional cry <i>nolo episcopari</i> (&#145;I do not wish to be made a bishop&#146;) was perhaps never more honestly and appropriately made.<br>
