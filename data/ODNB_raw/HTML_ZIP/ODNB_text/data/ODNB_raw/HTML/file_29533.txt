<span class="headword">Williams,  Penry</span>  (1802&#150;1885), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 9 February 1802 at 3 Bridgefield Terrace, Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the third son of William Williams, a painter and stonecutter, and his wife, Joan Meredith. His earliest surviving oil paintings depict the riots which occurred in 1816 at Merthyr (Cyfarthfa Castle Museum, Merthyr Tudful). About 1817 he painted views of the Cyfarthfa ironworks at Merthyr for its owner, William Crawshay. In 1819 Williams produced small oil views of waterfalls in the Vale of Neath (Cyfarthfa Castle Museum and National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff), copies of which were purchased by Michael Faraday and, probably, the Dowlais ironmaster Josiah John Guest.<br>
<br>By 1820 Williams had moved to London; in that year, he was awarded a silver medal by the Society of Arts for a landscape. In July 1821 he received a second medal for a study after the Elgin marbles, and by November he was a student of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who considered his crayon portraits &#145;very delicate and pretty&#146;  (Webley, 32). On 4 April 1822 Williams entered the Royal Academy Schools; he began to exhibit regularly at the academy and at the British Institution. In 1824 he painted a landscape for Sir Joseph Bailey, and began a series of watercolours for the Crawshay family, some of which were engraved on banknotes issued by the Chepstow and Merthyr banks. In the following year he illustrated a manuscript account by John Britton of Sir Thomas Hope's residence at Deepdene (RIBA BAL and borough of Lambeth archives). At the Royal Academy in 1826 Williams exhibited a highly accomplished, Italianate oil painting of Lancaster.<br>
<br>By 28 February 1827 Williams had crossed France, visited Switzerland and Florence, and arrived in Rome. His journey was financed by Sir Joseph Bailey, whom he reimbursed with oil paintings of continental scenes, including <span class="italic">Young Italian Peasants</span> and <span class="italic">A View of Rome from the Barberini Gardens</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1828 to 1829. In 1828 Williams was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and visited Naples. He became a close friend of the expatriate Welsh sculptor John Gibson, and established himself at Rome, where he remained, with only brief interruptions, for the rest of his life. His costume pieces in a landscape setting proved popular with British patrons, including the earl of Pembroke (<span class="italic">The Italian Family&#151;Ferry on the River Ninfa</span>, 1830; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), Sir J. J. Guest (<span class="italic">The Procession to the Christening in L'Ariccia</span>, 1831; Cyfarthfa Castle Museum), Lord Vernon (<span class="italic">Rest by the Wayside</span>, 1835, and <span class="italic">Italian Girl, with a Tambourine</span>, 1837; Tate collection), and Sir M. W. Ridley (<span class="italic">Festa della Madonna dell'Arco</span>, 1836; Cardiff City Hall). Williams briefly visited Britain and Naples in 1837, became friendly with Edward Lear, and was commissioned by Lord Grosvenor to paint <span class="italic">Il voto, or, The Convalescent</span> (exh. RA, 1842). Between 1839 and 1845 he executed a series of Neapolitan and Roman views for the duke of Sutherland, portraits of John Gibson (Accademia di San Luca, Rome) and Lady Charlotte Guest, and paintings for Bertel Thorvaldsen (Thorvaldsens Museum, Copenhagen) and his patron Baroness Stampe.<br>
<br>As an expatriate, Williams was ineligible for election to the Royal Academy. In 1841 John Gibson complained to his patron &#145;Margaret Sandbach&#146; that &#145;The works of Williams &hellip; are beautifully and admirably composed and drawn and very highly finished but are much ran down by English painters because they are not painted in the English style&#146;  (Webley, 62). Williams remained in Rome through the siege and political turmoil of 1848&#150;50, and in 1854 was praised in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> as &#145;undoubtedly the first English painter in Rome &hellip; Great delicacy and facility of execution, united with exquisite taste, the finest poetic feeling and the utmost freshness of colouring, pervade his works&#146;  (Webley, 81). From 1856 to 1857 he accompanied Gibson to England, and visited Henry Sandbach, who commissioned the <span class="italic">Scene in the Roman Campagna</span>, completed in 1865 (National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff). Albert Edward, prince of Wales, dined at his studio during a visit to Rome in January 1859. The critic James Dafforne commented on Williams in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1864:<blockquote>Except as a tolerably regular exhibitor at the Academy, and as an occasional visitor to London in the &#145;season&#146; &hellip; he has become almost an alien from his country &hellip; His style of painting &hellip; is so entirely foreign, so thoroughly identified with the country of his adoption, that it would scarcely pass for the work of an English painter. (Webley, 93)</blockquote>Williams attended Gibson during his final illness from 1865 to 1866 and served as his executor. Although still considered &#145;the most eminent painter of Roman scenery and groups of peasantry&#146; by Murray's <span class="italic">Handbook</span> in 1869  (Webley, 96), he produced few new compositions after 1860, and for the last two decades of his life confined himself largely to repetitions and variants of earlier, successful works. He consigned fifty-three oils, watercolours, and sketches for sale at Christies on 19 May 1876; the auction was not a success, only four of the lots finding buyers.<br>
<br>Fifty years after a visit to Williams's studio in 1864&#150;5, the artist and antiquary T. H. Thomas recalled his &#145;kindness and quiet geniality&#146; and described his working method:<blockquote>Having the subject clearly in his mind, he would &hellip; draw the composition upon the canvas &hellip; in pencil almost without an error &hellip; Then, in the same simple definite way, he would put in the first painting in a bright, fresh series of tints, upon which he could work until it attained its final tone &hellip; There was no experiment either as to forms or colours; all were strictly methodic. &hellip; Neatness and precision were &hellip; characteristic of the man. (Thomas, 7)</blockquote>Building on, and retaining, an initially local clientele, Williams became one of the leading painters in Rome, cultivating a highly finished style to accommodate a cosmopolitan circle of patrons. He died, unmarried, at his Rome address, via Babuino 65, on 27 July 1885 and was buried at the protestant cemetery in Rome.<br>
