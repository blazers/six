<span class="headword">Bowet,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1423), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was apparently a member of a Cumbrian gentry family who rose to local prominence in the second half of the fourteenth century, making two advantageous marriages (in which Bowet himself had a hand) and producing an MP for Cumberland. His mother was buried at Tupholme in Lincolnshire, but most of his known connections were with the area round Penrith, where kinsmen lived, the family owned land, his father was buried, and many of his servants and officials originated. His educational career suggests that he was born before the mid-1340s. He had probably received a licentiate in laws from Cambridge University by 1368, and his doctorate in canon and civil law from Bologna in 1382. A royal clerk by 1372, and an official of the bishop of Ely in the mid-1370s, by about 1380 he had entered the service of Henry Despenser, the warlike bishop of Norwich, for whom he probably negotiated papal authorization for the Flemish crusade of 1383. As commissary-general to the bishop, he organized the recruitment and finances of the crusade, a role that led to his commitment to the Tower of London when it ended in military fiasco amid charges of corruption. Brought before parliament, Bowet cleared Despenser of the charge of receiving bribes from the French, at the risk of inculpating himself. He was rewarded with his first major preferment, to the deanery of Dublin.<br>
<br>Between 1384 and 1392 Bowet served as royal proctor at the papal court. His courage in remaining with the pope after riots at Lucera in 1385, in which another Englishman was killed, earned him appointment as auditor of causes at the papal court; and his good standing with both the pope and Richard II led to his employment as ambassador between Rome and Westminster on several occasions. In 1387, during Richard II's struggle with the appellants, he acted as his agent in negotiations with pope and emperor which, though ostensibly directed against schismatics, may have been designed to secure aid against the king's domestic enemies. Nothing came of this scheme, but it earned Bowet the enmity of the appellants, who excluded him from the pardon issued at the end of the Merciless Parliament in 1388. He was stripped of his deanery of Dublin and of the archdeaconry of Lincoln granted him by the king in 1386. After Richard II's resumption of the reins of government in 1389 Bowet recovered his preferments and was reappointed proctor at the papal court in 1390. But early in 1392 he left Rome for the last time and returned to England to enter the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. In 1393 he was appointed to negotiate with the king of Castile, and in 1394 he sailed with John of Gaunt for Gascony, where he led the negotiations to secure recognition of Gaunt as duke of Aquitaine by the Gascon estates. By July 1396 he had been appointed constable of Bordeaux, and on 19 July 1397 was made chief justice of the superior court of Aquitaine. In the same year he was sent on an embassy to Aragon to negotiate, among other matters, a marriage alliance between Isabella of Aragon and Gaunt's eldest son, Henry Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>In 1398, however, Henry Bolingbroke was banished from England, and Bowet followed him into exile, having first secured for him permission to appoint a proxy to receive his inheritance in the event of the death of his father, Lancaster. When Lancaster died, however, on 3 February 1399, Richard II revoked his grant, and procured Bowet's condemnation in the committee of parliament at Shrewsbury. As the counsellor and abettor of Bolingbroke, Bowet was declared a traitor, and sentenced to execution, a sentence commuted to perpetual banishment in consideration of his clergy. His archdeaconry was again taken away from him. However, after the accession of Bolingbroke as Henry IV in September 1399, Bowet became one of the new king's inner circle of counsellors. He was immediately reappointed constable of Bordeaux. His loyalty was rewarded by restoration to his old preferment at Lincoln, by prebends at London and York, by extensive grants in Aquitaine, and by his appointment in May 1400 as one of the four regents in Aquitaine. His presence there helped to quell a rebellion at Bayonne and to pacify the duchy, shaken by the Lancastrian usurpation; but as soon as quieter circumstances permitted he returned to England, in December 1400, taking care to secure papal absolution for his part in warlike acts, homicides, and mutilations. At the king's insistence he was promoted to the first important bishopric to become vacant, despite opposition from the pope and the Commons, who preferred Richard Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1421). Bowet was provided to Bath and Wells, which had been vacant for eighteen months, on 19 August 1401 and consecrated at St Paul's on 20 November.<br>
<br>Bowet initially made an effort to run his diocese from his house near Westminster; but the appointment of a suffragan in June 1402 showed that he was still mainly devoted to cares of state. On 27 February 1402 he became treasurer, though he held that post for only eight months. Between 1402 and 1408, however, he was continually employed by Henry IV in various capacities, and frequently in his company, retained as his personal counsellor. His name appears constantly in the proceedings of the privy council. In 1403 he led an embassy to France and accompanied the king on his Welsh expedition on his return. In 1404 he negotiated with Castile; in 1405 with Scotland. In 1403, 1404, 1406, and 1407, he was a trier of petitions. In 1404 he was one of the king's council nominated in parliament, and in 1406 he swore to observe Henry's settlement of the succession. That same year he accompanied the court to Bishop's Lynn, and was thence dispatched on an important mission to Denmark, to escort Philippa, the king's daughter, to the home of her intended husband, Erik, the heir of the famous Margaret, who had united the three Scandinavian kingdoms. His report of the young king's character and the condition of his country is full of interest. It was his last major diplomatic mission.<br>
<br>Bowet had scarcely returned from his Danish embassy when he was translated by papal provision to York&#151;the archbishopric had been unoccupied for two and a half years since the execution of Richard Scrope on 8 June 1405. His appointment was a victory for the king and his servant and a defeat for the pope, who had pressed the candidature of Robert Hallum (<i>d</i>. 1417). Bowet was enthroned on 9 December 1407. With increasing age, and with important duties in the north, Bowet seems henceforth to have had less to do with the court, though, significantly, he was appointed to the council when Henry IV reasserted his control over the government in November 1411, and he was one of Henry IV's executors, and sat on a commission appointed to pay his debts. He was still often in parliament, where in 1413, 1414, 1415, and 1416 he was again trier of petitions; but he was employed on no more embassies, and his name appears less often in the proceedings of the council. In 1409 and 1410 he conducted a thorough primary visitation of his diocese and henceforth resided in the diocese for long periods. His register, though lacking documents of great public interest, is testimony to an orderly and careful administration. Bowet was on good terms with his canons, officials, and suffragans, and had no trouble with convocation after his early years. He built the great hall at Cawood and a new kitchen at Otley, and was a liberal benefactor to his cathedral. He acquired a great reputation for hospitality and sumptuous housekeeping that consumed 80 tuns of claret yearly. The inventory of his property shows him to have been possessed of very considerable wealth, much of which was distributed among his entourage. His rule contributed significantly to the stability of his province after years of turmoil.<br>
<br>In 1410 Bowet showed his zeal against Lollardy by acting as one of Arundel's assistants at the trial of Badby, and in 1421 he wrote a strong letter to the king against another heretic named John Tailor, or Bilton. One of his final public acts was characteristic. In 1417 the Scots profited by Henry V's absence in Normandy to invade England. Bowet, though probably already in his seventies and so infirm that he could only be carried in a litter, &#145;put himself in great peril&#146; once more for the Lancastrians and accompanied the army with his clergy. His bravery, patriotism, and loyalty largely encouraged the English to victory. He died on 20 October 1423, and was buried at the east end of York Minster, in the fine tomb he had built during his lifetime.<br>
