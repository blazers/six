<span class="headword">Sheppard,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1559?), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage, family, education, and upbringing. At Michaelmas 1543 he was <i>informator choristarum</i> at Magdalen College, Oxford, in succession to Thomas Preston, and he remained in office there until some time between Michaelmas (29 September) and Christmas 1547. Although master of the choristers, he was not also organist; nor was he a fellow of the college, nor did he kidnap or imprison choirboys as some modern accounts have held. The college accounts for 1546&#150;7 show a payment of &pound;8 to Sheppard for his stipend as master of the choristers, and in the same year he was reimbursed for books, vestments, and organ repair (35<i>s</i>. &#145;pro duodecim libris, et eidem reparanti organorum vitia&#146; and &pound;3 &#145;pro tribus cappis dalmaticis albis, per bursarios emptis ad festum Paschae&#146;). He was paid 5<i>s</i>. for music books at the end of 1547, at which point he was succeeded by one Mr Games.<br>
<br>Sheppard became a member of the Chapel Royal between 1547 and 1553. Chapel Royal records list the gentlemen in order of joining, so his being the third of the twenty-three new members between 1547 and 1553 suggests that he entered earlier rather than later in this period, which would agree with his disappearance from the Magdalen records at the end of 1547. On 21 April 1554 he supplicated for the DMus degree of the University of Oxford, stating that he had studied music assiduously for twenty years and had composed much music; but this cannot have been granted, as he would undoubtedly have been given the title doctor in manuscript ascriptions of his music if so. At this time he also seems to have rekindled his contacts with Magdalen, being paid 20<i>s</i>. on 15 December 1554 &#145;pro quibusdam canticis&#146; (&#145;for certain songs&#146;; Macray, 2.121). He was certainly based at court by then as he was domiciled at Westminster; the Jane Sheppard who was buried in the churchyard of St Margaret's, Westminster, on 9 April 1555 may have been his first wife. On new year's day 1557 he presented a roll of songs to the queen. Arrangements were made for livery for Mary's funeral (13 December 1558) and Elizabeth's coronation (15 January 1559) to be provided to him. However, during a severe visitation of epidemic disease in Westminster he had sketched an initial draft of his will on 1 December 1558, requesting burial in Westminster Abbey or, if leave were declined, in St Margaret's beside his first wife. His was a common name, and it is possible that he may be identified with the John Scheperde who was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 21 December 1558. Yet this supposition is not consistent with the expectation that he would be present at Elizabeth's coronation, if it may be believed that the official who drew up the list had up-to-date knowledge of the gentlemen. It is more likely that he died about the middle of January 1559, for his will was presented for probate on 31 January 1559. His request for burial in Westminster Abbey would probably not have been made without some understanding that it would be granted, while his second choice of St Margaret's may reflect his anticipation that by the time of his death the abbot and convent of Westminster would no longer be in charge of the abbey. That they were makes it very feasible that he was indeed buried there.<br>
<br>Sheppard's draft will reveals that he had one child, Nathan, and a stepchild, Elizabeth; the former was old enough to assume certain financial responsibilities, while the latter was under age. She was the daughter of Sheppard's second wife, Elizabeth, whose first married name is thought to have been Clivigenne. Sheppard appointed Edmund Danyell as overseer of his will in respect of its provisions for his children. Danyell was subdean of the Chapel Royal and perhaps an Oxford colleague, having been at Merton College between 1540 and at least 1544. Nathan, sometimes appearing under the alias Chapman, later entered service as a schoolmaster with the Petre family of Ingatestone and Thorndon, Essex, a noted recusant family who also patronized William Byrd in the 1580s; he was still alive in 1611. Though not a rich man (his salary of &pound;8 at Magdalen in 1547 compares unfavourably with the &pound;10 paid some thirty years earlier to Thomas Ashwell at Durham), Sheppard was able to leave to Nathan an annuity out of which he was to pay his stepsister &pound;4 and his stepmother &pound;10 annually. To his wife Sheppard left the residue of his estate, and to his son the manor of Dean in the parish of St John, Margate, granted (in reversion) jointly to Sheppard and his Chapel Royal colleague Richard Edwards by Queen Mary on 13 July 1558.<br>
<br>Sheppard's early death is a profound loss to music, and the importance and brilliant quality of his compositions are now fully accepted. Most of his surviving music is for the pre-Reformation service and comes from the extensive collections copied mainly between 1575 and <i>c</i>.1581 by John Baldwin, a lay clerk at St George's, Windsor, from 1575 and later a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. The extreme familiarity shown by Baldwin towards Sheppard's name in his ascriptions (he sometimes simply calls him &#145;S&#146;) and the high proportion of works by Sheppard in these collections, made at least fifteen years after his death when there was no longer any liturgical occasion in the established church for their performance, suggest the esteem in which he was held by a fellow professional. Elsewhere, another indication of contemporary opinion appears against his gradual <span class="italic">Haec dies</span>, which is described in one partbook as &#145;a goode songe excellent good song fyne&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30484, fol. 8) and in another as &#145;the best songe in England&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30480, fol. 68<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Sheppard's music is characterized by a punchy contrapuntal style in which simple points of imitation enter very quickly. For example, in the respond and prose <span class="italic">Gaude gaude gaude Maria virgo</span> all six voices enter within four beats, giving an impression of contrapuntal imitation even though not all of them are entirely imitative. The variety of sound is well illustrated in the prose section of this work, &#145;Inviolata&#146;, where he changes the texture by dropping alto and tenor and dividing both treble and mean voices, thus placing the emphasis on the higher part of his overall vocal range. His two settings of <span class="italic">Libera nos, salva nos</span> (strictly a matins antiphon for Trinity Sunday, but at Magdalen College this text was recited twice daily with the verse <span class="italic">Benedicamus patrem</span>, a usage that surely connects at least these works with Magdalen rather than the Chapel Royal) again highlight the treble voices, with intricate rippling counterpoint crowning the slow-moving plainsong, or faburden, in the bass. Elsewhere his contrapuntal technique is even more enterprising: at &#145;Media nocte&#146; in another respond, <span class="italic">Audivi vocem de coelo</span>, the four voices enter on succeeding pitches of the scale, down a seventh or up a ninth from the previous entry, a technique rarely found and never, as here, based on the plainsong. When a voice breaks off before a new point of imitation it does so only briefly and resumes (again in close proximity to other entries) without more ado, and so, since all the voices are so quickly brought in, it follows that the sound is full and the urgency is marked. On the other hand, Sheppard uses a melismatic style at the ends of phrases, once most of the text has been declaimed. In his mass <span class="italic">Cantate</span> his assured handling of the six-part free contrapuntal texture, largely unconstrained by a <i>cantus firmus</i>, shows the new direction that Latin music might have taken.<br>
<br>Sheppard's hymns follow the normal layout of the time, with plainsong and complex polyphony alternating verse by verse. His flexibility of scoring is particularly noticeable here, for succeeding verses are occasionally set to quite different combinations. In <span class="italic">Sacris solemniis</span>, which is in up to eight parts, he sometimes divides the treble and the mean voices briefly into two, as if he is so bursting with potential contrapuntal entry points that he does not have enough voices for them all. In most of the hymns the tune is prominent at the top of the texture and there are distinct settings for each verse, which is an early example of variation, a technique just beginning to appear in England in the keyboard music of his fellow gentleman of the chapel Thomas Tallis.<br>
<br>Much of Sheppard's composition for the vernacular services of the Edwardian books of common prayer well illustrates the way in which composers at the beginning of the Reformation applied the values implicit in the so-called Lincoln Cathedral injunctions of April 1548; these reflect one of the chief aims of the English Reformation, to make the liturgy better understood, and state that composers should select and translate the best texts &#145;settyng therunto a playn and distincte note, for every sillable one&#146;. His anthem &#145;I give you a new commandment&#146; is typical, being written in syllabic style, though with imitative counterpoint, in a simple ABB form. Yet one of his most elaborate works for the English rite is his &#145;second&#146; service (<span class="roman">Magnificat</span> and <span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span>), which, especially towards the ends of phrases, has a complex and contrapuntal note for every syllable several, much like his Latin music. This sophisticated and confident work must date either from the early days of composition in English, before 1553, or from the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, when she anticipated restoring the 1549 prayer book. If the latter, however, it would need to have been written in little more than a month by a man who may have been mortally ill. The basic texture is in five parts, dropping to four when the two sides of the choir (decani and cantoris) alternate, but then Sheppard achieves up to eight real parts by considerable dovetailing as one side of the choir continues its phrase after the other has commenced the next. The assured word-setting, with its characteristic capture of the internal rhythms of the text, if necessary at the expense of the strong beats, is also indicative of the increasing confidence with which he and his generation approached the vernacular. Indeed, on many occasions in this work there are pre-echoes of Byrd's &#145;great&#146; service in the rhythms, and even sometimes the shape, of the imitative points. While the beginning of the phrase at, for example, &#145;and to be the glory of thy people Israel&#146; (<span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span>) is plain, distinct, and syllabic, Sheppard treats the imitative point at length: there are no fewer than twelve entries of the point.<br>
<br>Only one significant example of Sheppard's secular work survives, &#145;O happy dames&#146;, in a keyboard arrangement with just the opening title, but the text by Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, can be fitted easily; sacred vernacular <i>contrafacta</i> also survive for this work, &#145;I will give thanks&#146; and &#145;O happie man if thou repent&#146;, though the Howard poem is the more likely original.<br>
<br>In addition to Baldwin's approbation, Sheppard was known, at least by repute, to Thomas Morley, who in his <span class="italic">Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke</span> (1597) includes Sheppard with his peers as one of the &#145;famous Englishmen&#146; skilled in composition. In the eighteenth century Burney and Hawkins both noticed him, but did not select his best works for discussion. Sheppard's music was little known during the early years of the twentieth century, although scholarly performers such as Alexander Ramsbotham, R. R. Terry, and H. B. Collins were discovering and performing it in the 1920s and 1930s. His work was to have been included in the second series of <span class="roman">Tudor Church Music</span>, which never appeared because of funding difficulties. In 1958 his music was particularly prominent in F. Ll. Harrison's important study <span class="italic">Music in Medieval Britain</span>, and in the 1960s scholars and performers of Sheppard's old Oxford college, Magdalen, led the way towards a thoroughgoing assessment of his work, both in print and in sound, establishing him without doubt as one of the major figures of the sixteenth century.<br>
<br>So it is for its exceptionally interesting sounds and concise counterpoint that Sheppard's music is valued today: he knew his choir and the effects it could achieve and he handled it perfectly and with subtlety. The beauty of the sound he creates is the result of contrapuntal skill, combined with great flexibility of scoring within the overall twenty-three-note compass characteristic of English choirs of this period. His works are among the outstanding masterpieces of sixteenth-century music.<br>
