<span class="headword">Langhorne,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1679), <span class="occ">barrister and victim of the Popish Plot</span>, was probably born in London, the son of Richard Langhorne (<i>d</i>. 1635), an apothecary in London, and Dorothy Legate (<i>b</i>. 1606), daughter of Thomas Legate of Havering atte Bower, Essex. He had two brothers, Thomas and Edmund, and a sister, Elizabeth. Little is known about him before his admission to the Inner Temple on 31 May 1647 and his being called to the bar on 27 November 1654. Despite the occasional suggestion that he attended a Jesuit college on the continent there is no evidence. At an unknown date he married Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1659&#150;<i>c</i>.1679). They had four children: Charles, the youngest son (1660&#150;1723); his two older brothers, Richard (<i>d</i>. 1719) and Francis (<i>c</i>.1659&#150;1709); and a sister, Laetitia (<i>d</i>. 1729). Charles and Francis were priests, Richard and Laetitia Catholic nonjurors. The three sons attended the English College at St Omer. In 1676 the oldest son disappeared, apparently joining the French army, and lost contact with his family. He later returned to St Omer, contacted English Jesuits there, and through their intercession re-established contact with his father, who paid for his return home. In 1677 Charles Langhorne, then a student in Valladolid, entrusted to Titus Oates a letter to his father. Oates had been expelled from the college on 30 October for serious moral lapses and returned to London. After a brief sojourn Oates travelled to St Omer with a letter of gratitude from Langhorne to the Jesuits for all they had done for his sons.<br>
<br>Langhorne built a successful legal practice from his quarters in the Inner Temple. Gilbert Burnet claimed that he &#145;passed as Protestant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 155) without further explanation. At least from 1664 he lived in Shire (or Sheer) Lane, Holborn. Among his clients&#151;or at least his acquaintances&#151;were the recusant William Blundell of Crosby; the Hatton family; William Penn; and the Society of Jesus. To the first, on 3 November 1666, he confided his disappointment that Charles II had capitulated to parliament and agreed to execute the penal laws against Catholics. Langhorne's <span class="italic">Consideration touching the great question of the king's right in dispensing with the penal laws</span> (London, 1687), written in defence of Charles II's declaration of indulgence in 1672, was edited by his son Richard and published to support James II's proclamations in 1687. For the Jesuits, Langhorne provided legal and financial advice to the Jesuit provincial and procurator, and served as their trustee.<br>
<br>Titus Oates and Israel Tonge unleashed the Popish Plot on 28 September 1678 with the arrest of three Jesuits and a Benedictine. Langhorne was arrested a week later. As he explained, &#145;I must be a perfect Mad-man to appear publickly, and not to flie or conceal my self, if I were conscious of any the least imaginable Guilt&#146;  (Langhorne, <span class="italic">Memoires</span>, 2), since he continued to work after their arrest. Charged with high treason Langhorne remained in close confinement in Newgate: Oates claimed&#151;and William Bedloe corroborated&#151;that the correspondence he delivered between Langhorne and the Jesuits dealt with treason and treachery. Found guilty of high treason on 13 June and sentenced to be executed on the 20th, Langhorne received a reprieve for a month on the 19th as a result of a petition by his wife (a &#145;true Protestant&#146;  (McCoog, &#145;Richard Langhorne&#146;, 499)) so that he could tidy up the financial affairs of his clients. Moreover she promised to persuade him to reveal all he knew about the plot and about Jesuit finances. Langhorne produced a potentially damaging disclosure of some Jesuit assets. On 15 July 1679 Charles Hatton told Lord Hatton that Langhorne had received the approval of the imprisoned Jesuit provincial Thomas Whitbread (alias Harcott or Harcourt) to do so, but how two close prisoners could communicate remains unexplained especially since the provincial was executed the day after the offer was made. Langhorne's disclosure about Jesuit finances was in the hands of Charles II and the privy council by 3 July. The council was not satisfied; the king ordered that no copy of it be made and, mysteriously, returned the original to the author. A copy, however, was made and can now be found in the Royal Archives in Brussels.<br>
<br>Langhorne was executed at Tyburn, London, on 14 July 1679. In his speech from the gibbet he made an extraordinary declaration for a man on such familiar terms with the Jesuits: he professed Charles II his &#145;True and Lawful Sovereign&#146; as understood by the oath of allegiance, and denied that the pope had any right to depose monarchs  (Langhorne, <span class="italic">Memoires</span>, 18). Pope Pius XI beatified him on 15 December 1929.<br>
