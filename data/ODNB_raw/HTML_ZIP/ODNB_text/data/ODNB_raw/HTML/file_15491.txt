<span class="headword">Kettlewell,  John</span>  (1653&#150;1695), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and theological writer</span>, was born on 10 March 1653 at Brompton in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He was the second, and eldest surviving, son of the three sons and one daughter of John Kettlewell (<i>d</i>. 1659), merchant of Northallerton, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Ogle. Kettlewell was educated at Northallerton school under the zealous royalist Thomas Smelt. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 11 November 1670 as servitor to the principal, Dr Thomas Tully, and graduated BA on 20 June 1674. Kettlewell was elected to a fellowship at Lincoln College on 28 July 1675, partly through the influence of another alumnus of Smelt's school and future nonjuror, Dr George Hickes. Kettlewell proceeded MA on 3 May 1677. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford, Dr John Fell, in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 10 June 1677, and priest on 24 February 1678.<br>
<br>Kettlewell's first book, <span class="italic">The Measures of Christian Obedience</span>, was written between Christmas 1677 and Easter 1678, but not published until 1681, with a dedication, which Hickes had suggested, to Henry Compton, bishop of London. This work on the subject of a Christian's duty to obey the laws of the gospels went through six editions to 1714. It also attracted the attention of Anne Russell, countess of Bedford, who appointed Kettlewell as her chaplain, and of Simon, Lord Digby. As chaplain to the Russell family Kettlewell attempted to counteract the influence of Samuel Johnson, the radical whig chaplain to Lord William Russell, the countess's son. He failed at this, but shortly before his execution for participation in the Rye House plot in 1683 William Russell sent Kettlewell an affectionate message. Digby, a connection of the countess's by marriage, appointed Kettlewell as vicar of Coleshill, Warwickshire, after his first choice, John Rawlet of St Nicholas, Newcastle, had turned him down and recommended Kettlewell.<br>
<br>Kettlewell read his first service at Coleshill on 10 December 1682. He was an effective vicar, providing poor families with copies of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>, and persuading the pious Digby to restore great tithes to the value of &pound;100 to the living. He resigned his fellowship at Lincoln on 22 November 1683 and devoted his whole effort to his parish, where several charities were founded by his means and through gifts from Lord Digby and others. Part of Kettlewell's pastoral duty was to preach in preparation for the worthy reception of the eucharist. The sacrament was extremely important to Kettlewell's piety, and he wanted to encourage more frequent celebration and reception at Coleshill. His preparatory sermons were published in 1683 as <span class="italic">An Help and Exhortation to Worthy Communicating</span>, with a dedication to Lord Digby. <span class="italic">An Help and Exhortation</span> went through ten editions to 1737. During the tory reaction Kettlewell earned a reputation as a very strong advocate of passive obedience and non-resistance. A sermon he preached to the clergy after the suppression of the Monmouth revolt, &#145;Measures of Christian subjection&#146;, was published after his death in his collected works. His sermons on the deaths of his patrons were published as <span class="italic">A Funeral Sermon for the Lady Frances Digby</span> (1684) and <span class="italic">Sermon on the Occasion of the Death of Simon, Lord Digby</span> (1686). At Coleshill, Kettlewell was a friend of the future founder of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, Thomas Bray, who long after Kettlewell's death would continue to recommend his doctrinal works. Despite his devotion to his parish Kettlewell had not given up hope of rising in the church: in 1684, on the death of the archdeacon of Coventry, George Downing, he petitioned the archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, for two offices left vacant by Downing's death, the archidiaconate itself and the prebend of Alrewas. His petition was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1685 Kettlewell married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1719?), daughter of Anthony Lybb (1607&#150;1674) of Hardwick House in the parish of Whitchurch, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Mary Keate (<i>d</i>. 1692). The two had been brought together by the curate of Whitchurch, William Musson, who performed the ceremony there. It included what was at the time the unusual feature of the couple's joint reception of the sacrament. Kettlewell's married life seems to have been happy, although Jane suffered from ill health and the couple had no children. Kettlewell's principal diversions from his work were music and walking. He played the violincello, bass viol, and violin.<br>
<br>During the reign of James II, Kettlewell published a visitation sermon, <span class="italic">The Religious Loyalist</span> (1686) and a work on Christian doctrine, <span class="italic">The practical believer, or, The articles of the apostle's creed drawn out to form a true Christian's heart and practice</span> (1688), which developed out of his parish catechizing. <span class="italic">The Practical Believer</span> went through six editions to 1713, and a Welsh translation by Richard ap Robert was published in 1768. Unlike many Church of England divines Kettlewell did not preach against Roman Catholicism during James's reign. During this time Kettlewell's sacramental and Laudian piety drew some unfavourable attention. After his wife's death Digby donated to Coleshill a set of silver communion plates solemnly consecrated by Sancroft, an act that seemed to many idolatrous.<br>
<br>Kettlewell's life was drastically altered by the revolution of 1688. He followed his high tory principles with absolute consistency, continuing to preach against any form of resistance to James II. He quickly removed the dedication to Compton from <span class="italic">The Measures of Christian Obedience</span> once he learned that Compton had appeared in arms for William of Orange. After the revolution he was harassed by local dissenters and supporters of William, as well as by soldiers passing through on their way to the war in Ireland. Kettlewell lost his vicarage in 1690 for refusing to take the oaths to the new sovereigns. He relocated to London, where he became one of the leading nonjuring writers and controversialists. His nonjuring publications include <span class="italic">Of Christian prudence, or religious wisdom, not degenerating into irreligious craftiness in trying times</span> (1691); <span class="italic">Christianity, a doctrine of the cross, or, Passive obedience under any pretended invasion of legal rights and liberties</span>, published anonymously in 1691 and with Kettlewell's name in 1695; an anonymous contribution to the controversy over Dr William Sherlock's defence of taking the oaths, <span class="italic">The duty of allegiance settled upon its true grounds, in answer to a late book of Dr. Will. Sherlock, entituled the case of the allegiance due to sovereign powers</span> (1691); and <span class="italic">Of Christian Communion, to be Kept on in the Unity of Christ's Church</span> (1693). <span class="italic">Of Christian Communion</span> was a particularly influential work among the moderate nonjurors who envisioned an eventual return to the national church, as in its conclusion Kettlewell endorsed attendance at the services of the established church for those laity without access to nonjuring services. His controversial writings are marked by an absence of rancour and personal abuse, while adhering firmly to the nonjuring position as the only right one.<br>
<br>In the long run Kettlewell's devotional writings during this period were more influential than his nonjuring polemic. <span class="italic">A Companion for the Penitent, and Persons Troubled in Mind</span> (1694) went through eight editions to 1794, and its office for the sick was employed and praised by as staunch a defender of the established church as William Wake. Sometimes published with <span class="italic">A Companion for the Penitent</span> was another work of Kettlewell's, <span class="italic">A Companion for the Persecuted, or, An Office for those who Suffer for Righteousness</span> (1693). <span class="italic">Death Made Comfortable, or, The Way to Die Well</span> (1695) was published four times to 1722.<br>
<br>Kettlewell's life as a nonjuror was quiet, and he was not attacked by the government. His extreme scrupulousness can be seen in his dealings with Hickes, who was disguised as a soldier while hiding from the government. Such was Kettlewell's horror of any deceit that he would never address the disguised Hickes by his assumed title of &#145;Major&#146;. Kettlewell's closest friends in the nonjuring community, including the deprived bishop of Bath and Wells, Thomas Ken, and the layman Robert Nelson were of milder temperament and politics than the fiery Hickes. Kettlewell seems to have replaced John Tillotson as a spiritual guide for Nelson when Nelson abandoned the established church for the nonjuring movement. Kettlewell encouraged him in writing his classic <span class="italic">A Companion for the Festivals and Fasts of the Church of England</span> (1704).<br>
<br>Kettlewell had inherited a farm at Lowfields, near Brompton, from his father, and did not suffer the poverty of many nonjuring clergy. He was also supported from the great tithes of Coleshill, which the Digby family diverted to supporting nonjurors. Kettlewell's good financial situation enabled him to continue his lifelong habit of paying for all purchases on the spot and also to suggest remedies for the desperate financial situation of many nonjuring clergy without being seen as swayed by his own situation. Kettlewell interceded with Sir William Boothby for the deprived bishop of Kilmore, Dr William Sheridan, and proposed the establishment of a fund for the relief of deprived nonjuring clergy in a letter to the deprived nonjuring bishop of Norwich, William Lloyd, dated 20 December 1694. Circulars were distributed supporting the fund and appealing for donations. The project failed, however, as the government's attention was drawn to it. Prosecutions were launched, but they did not affect Kettlewell directly, as he had died in London after a long wasting illness on 12 April 1695.<br>
<br>Kettlewell's deathbed was attended by his wife, sister, and surviving brother, Robert, the publisher of some of his books, as well as Nelson. Jane Kettlewell was named executor of his estate. Kettlewell had earlier settled the farm at Lowfields in a trust to be devoted to the poor of Northallerton and Brompton on Jane's death, which occurred about 1719. Nelson had been given charge of Kettlewell's books and papers, and published several books from Kettlewell's unpublished manuscripts. <span class="italic">Five Discourses on so many Important Points of Practical Religion</span> appeared in 1696 with a biographical preface by Nelson. It was followed by <span class="italic">An Office for Prisoners for Crimes</span> in 1697 and <span class="italic">The Great Evil and Danger of Profuseness and Prodigality</span> in 1705. Nelson also sponsored the publication of the two-volume <span class="italic">A Compleat Collection of the Works of the Reverend and Learned John Kettlewell</span> in 1719, prefaced with a biography of Kettlewell by Francis Lee that is the chief source for his life.<br>
<br>John Kettlewell was buried on 15 April 1695 at the church of All Hallows Barking, London, where Archbishop William Laud had been interred. Ken performed the funeral ceremony, the only time after his deprivation that he is recorded as officiating in public. The funeral was quite crowded, with thirty or forty clergy and many laity attending.<br>
