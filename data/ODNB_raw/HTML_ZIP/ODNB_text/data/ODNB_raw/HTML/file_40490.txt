<span class="headword">Small,  William</span>  (1734&#150;1775), <span class="occ">physician and natural philosopher</span>, was the third son of the Revd James Small (<i>d</i>. 1771), and Lilias, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott (<i>d</i>. 1775), of Carmyllie, Forfarshire, Scotland. He was born there on 13 October 1734 and was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he received his MA in 1755 and his MD in 1765. In 1758 Small was in America to take up the post of professor of natural philosophy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he revolutionized the teaching of the subject, introducing a lecture system, newly fashionable in Europe. Among his students were John Page, later thrice governor of Virginia, and Thomas Jefferson, whom he taught ethics, rhetoric, and belles lettres, and with whom he remained in contact. He seems to have met Benjamin Franklin in Williamsburg in the spring of 1763. However, Small was unhappy in Virginia, in poor health (apparently with malaria), and bitterly at odds with other faculty members. When he travelled to London in the autumn of 1764 to buy scientific apparatus, he chose not to return to America.<br>
<br>In London, Small was a guest of the surgeon John Belchier at the Royal Society on 24 January 1765. Following Benjamin Franklin's letter of recommendation on his behalf to Matthew Boulton, Small moved to Birmingham in May, where he quickly became established in the town's medical and scientific network. He shared rooms at 9 Temple Row with John Ash, and became a subscriber to the proposed general hospital; they both served on its founding committee from 1765. In the same year Small joined the embryonic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59220', "Lunar Society of Birmingham")</script>; he was one of its first four members, and increasingly acted as its honorary secretary. Meanwhile, his medical practice was thriving. While holding a daily hour-long free clinic for the poor, he had a prosperous clientele, which included Matthew Boulton and William Russell, a wealthy Birmingham merchant, as well as their families. In his <span class="italic">Medical Miscellany</span> (1769) Thomas Tomlinson thanked both Ash and Small for their guidance. Small's fees were substantial and from town practice alone he earned an average of &pound;500 a year, rising to &pound;600 in the 1770s. His scientific investments, which were a considerable further source of income, included a share in Boulton's Soho development, where he acted as a technical consultant. Small's friendships and acquaintances were extensive, all based on his wide scientific interests. He was an early supporter and correspondent of James Watt, whom he had known in Glasgow, and seems to have introduced him to Matthew Boulton. Through his connections with Boulton and the Lunar Society, Small was also linked to John Baskerville, Joseph Black, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, James Keir, and Josiah Wedgwood. He carried on an extensive correspondence with most of these men and his advice was often sought, for example in the difficulties of extending Watt's patent. Small became involved in town affairs: from 1769 he served on the committee for lighting and improving Birmingham, and became a subscriber to the new theatre in King Street in 1774.<br>
<br>Small's own scientific work was many-sided. He was interested in improving clock mechanisms, in optics (telescopes and microscopes), in geology, metallurgy, ceramics, gunnery, chemistry (especially alkali)&#151;even in making a new kind of lead pencil. He corresponded with Joseph Priestley when the latter was writing his major work on air, and he urged James Watt to publish his research. Small himself took out a patent in 1773 (no. 1048) for a simplified clock design.<br>
<br>Small seems to have had a withdrawn, shy personality; he never married and Erasmus Darwin noted that he lived &#145;quite a recluse studious life&#146;. Unlike other &#145;Lunatics&#146;, Small did not write for publication, although his correspondence was considerable. He appears never to have enjoyed robust good health and to have always greatly preferred scientific work to medical practice. Even towards the end of his life in 1773 he was considering leaving Birmingham and taking up an academic post in Scotland. However, he died in Birmingham, apparently of &#145;ague&#146;, aged only forty, on 25 February 1775: Boulton had noted how ill Small had been earlier in the month. Small was buried in St Philip's churchyard, Birmingham, on 15 March. Erasmus Darwin wrote an obituary poem to him, and there were many expressions of loss at his death. His portrait sketch shows a simply dressed, plainly wigged man, arms folded defensively, sitting near his quill pen, inkpot, and books&#151;clearly his world. William Withering took over much of Small's medical work when he moved to Birmingham in May 1775.<br>
