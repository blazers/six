<span class="headword">Gregory, Sir  Augustus Charles</span>  (1819&#150;1905), <span class="occ">explorer and surveyor in Australia</span>, born on 1 August 1819 at Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire, was the second of the five sons of Joshua Gregory (1790/1792&#150;1838), an army officer from an old Nottinghamshire family, and his wife, Frances (1794&#150;1859), the sister of Charles Blissett Churchman of London. His father retired after having been wounded in action, and received in lieu of pension a grant of land in the Swan river settlement in Western Australia; he arrived there with his wife and family on 6 October 1829.<br>
<br>After being privately educated in England and Australia, Gregory worked from 1841 to 1854 in the survey department of Western Australia. He proved a skilful surveyor and organizer, and an alert observer of the bush. In 1846, having obtained leave of absence, he began exploring the interior of the continent, starting on 7 August from Bolgart Spring, 60 miles north-east of Perth, accompanied by his brothers <a href="#cosubject_62027">Francis [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Henry Churchman. Their progress eastwards was soon stopped by an immense salt lake. This compelled them to turn north-west, where, after travelling 950 miles in forty-seven days, they discovered some good grazing land and a coal seam at the headwaters of the River Irwin east of Geraldton. In September 1848 Gregory led a party northward. He revealed the pastoral wealth of the Murchison and Champion Bay (Geraldton) districts and discovered a lode of galena in the bed of the Murchison River, 350 miles north of Perth; the journey of 1500 miles had taken ten weeks.<br>
<br>After seven years of routine surveying, in 1855&#150;6 Gregory undertook an expedition under the auspices of the imperial government, via the Royal Geographical Society, to explore the unknown interior of the northern territory and search for traces of the lost explorer Ludwig Leichhardt. The party, which included the distinguished botanist Ferdinand von M&uuml;ller and the artist Thomas Baines, ascended the Victoria River in the Northern Territory from its mouth to its source, found that the south-flowing Sturt Creek ended in desert, and then made its way to the Gulf of Carpentaria and thence across the northern peninsula and down the east coast to Rockhampton. The expedition shed much light on the drainage of the region, discovered the watershed formed by the Newcastle and Gregory ranges at the northern end of the Great Dividing Range, and charted 5000 miles of hitherto unknown territory. No certain traces of Leichhardt were found and the natural resources discovered were disappointing, but for this expedition Gregory was in 1857 awarded the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society. His report of 1857 stimulated considerable pastoral settlement but did not establish him as a heroic explorer, as he understated his role as an inventive and thorough organizer.<br>
<br>In 1858 Gregory was sent by the New South Wales government to renew the search for Leichhardt. He started from Sydney on 12 January and reached the Barcoo River in April. At latitude 24&deg; 25' S and longitude 145&deg; E, he found a tree marked L and some stumps of others which had been felled with an axe. In May he reached the Thomson River, and followed it upstream until it ran out. He then pushed down Cooper Creek, which he found to be the lower reaches of the Barcoo River and then on south to Adelaide. He had solved the problem of the north-east inland river system and found that south-west Queensland had pastoral possibilities, but the fate of Leichhardt was as much in doubt as ever.<br>
<br>Gregory was then employed in defining the southern boundary of Queensland. From 1859 to 1863 he was the colony's first commissioner of crown lands, and from 1859 to 1875 he was its surveyor-general. Charged with allocating the new colony's lands, its greatest resource, he favoured large-scale squatters over smallholders, and in 1867 he handed over much of the Darling downs to pastoralists. In 1875 he was appointed Queensland's geological surveyor. In 1882 he was nominated to the legislative council, where he was prominent in debate, his intimate knowledge of the country and its resources and his fund of scientific information securing him a hearing even from those whose opinions differed from his. He always sat with the opposition in order to be free to criticize government measures, and generally allied himself with reactionary squatter interest.<br>
<br>Gregory was one of the first members of the Toowong shire council, and in 1902 became its first mayor. He was a trustee of the Queensland Museum from 1876 to 1899, and from 1876 to 1883 sat on the commission to inquire into the condition of the Aborigines. In 1895 he was president at Brisbane of the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science, and devoted his opening address to a sketch of the geological and geographical history of Australia. He was created CMG in 1874 and KCMG on 9 November 1903. He was an active freemason for fifty years and was a devoted member of the Church of England. He died unmarried, of pneumonia, on 25 June 1905 at his home, Rainsworth, Rosalie, Brisbane, and was buried after a masonic funeral in Toowong cemetery.<br>
<br>Gregory was one of Australia's foremost explorers, but in person and in his writings lacked the panache of the pioneer, and his reputation suffered as a result. In 1884 the Queensland government published <span class="italic">Collected Journals of Australian Exploration</span>, his collected papers and those of his brother <a name="cosubject_62027"></a><span class="headword">Francis Thomas Gregory</span>  (1821&#150;1888)<span class="occ"></span>. The latter was employed in the survey office of Western Australia from 1841 to 1860 and took up land in the Avon district. He accompanied Augustus in his first expedition in 1846, and led two expeditions himself in 1858 and 1861, when he traced a number of rivers from the Shark Bay and Nickol Bay areas, some 400 and 800 miles north of Perth respectively. On the latter journey he discovered the Hamersley ranges, and was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1863. After going to Queensland in 1862, he was appointed commissioner of crown lands, and on 11 May 1865 he married Marion (<i>b</i>. 1841), the daughter of Alexander Hume. He was nominated to the legislative council in 1874, and was briefly postmaster-general in the first McIlwraith ministry in 1883. He died on 23 October 1888.<br>
