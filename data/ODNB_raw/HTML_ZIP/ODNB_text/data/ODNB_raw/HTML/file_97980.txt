<span class="headword">Eldridge,  Ernest Arthur Douglas</span>  (1897&#150;1935), <span class="occ">motor racer and world land speed record-holder</span>, was born at 13 Burton Road, Kilburn, London, on 18 July 1897, the son of Arthur Eldridge (1871&#150;1945), financier's clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Appleby. He was educated at Harrow School (1909&#150;13), where it was said he owned and ran a motor car in defiance of a school ban. During the First World War he was a volunteer ambulance driver in the French Red Cross. He spoke perfect French, and later lived in Paris. Aged eighteen, though describing himself as twenty-one, he married at Brentford register office on 20 November 1915 Marjorie May, daughter of Ashley Tooth, of independent means.<br>
<br>Eldridge made his name driving and modifying aero-engined &#145;monster racers&#146; which owed their existence to the sale of surplus military aircraft components by the Aircraft Disposal Board in the years after the First World War. He made his first appearance at the famous Brooklands racetrack in Weybridge at the midsummer meeting of 1921, driving an Isotta-Fraschini. The car, originally manufactured in 1907, had last been driven at the circuit in 1913. After extensive modification at his garage in London the vehicle was transformed via the incorporation of a 240 hp Maybach engine. In 1922 Eldridge claimed his first Brooklands victory in spectacular fashion, driving his Isotta-Fraschini at over 100 m.p.h. for each of his flying laps in an eleven mile contest.<br>
<br>Eldridge's next project was the gargantuan Fiat <i>Mephistopheles</i>. It was originally a chain-driven sprint model; Eldridge had purchased the car for a rumoured &pound;25, and extended its chassis by eighteen inches with sections of a London bus in order to incorporate a 260 hp Fiat aero engine. In June 1923 the two-ton <i>Mephistopheles</i> claimed a new Brooklands lap record of 124.33 m.p.h. In August 1923 he gained the Royal Aero Club aviator's certificate, flying a Sopwith Gnu.<br>
<br>In July 1924 Eldridge competed in the Arpajon speed trials, alongside the Frenchman R&eacute;n&eacute; Thomas. The contest, which took place about twenty miles from Paris, was held on a public road four and a quarter miles in length. Thomas in his Delage set a new land speed record of 143.31 m.p.h. over two runs, with Eldridge in <i>Mephistopheles</i> attaining a higher average approaching 147 m.p.h. Eldridge was subsequently disqualified following a complaint from Thomas that the Fiat did not conform with regulations as it had no reverse gear. Undeterred, Eldridge persuaded the officials and gendarmerie to prepare the road course once more a week later, and following an adjustment to <i>Mephistopheles</i>'s gearbox he set an official land speed record of 146.01 m.p.h., the last to be set on a public road.<br>
<br>Eldridge's feat garnered little of the press interest in Britain that was accorded to other land speed records of the 1920s, probably because it was achieved in a Fiat. When Malcolm Campbell claimed the record just two months after Eldridge by a margin of 0.015 seconds, it was reported that &#145;England [had] snatched a world's record from Italy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 26 Sept 1924). At Brooklands, Eldridge remained a popular figure. His head-to-head contest with John Godfrey Parry Thomas in August 1925 over ten laps was considered one of the most thrilling in the history of British motorsport. Both <i>Mephistopheles</i> and Thomas's Leyland-Thomas lost tyre treads during the encounter, which ended in a narrow victory for Thomas.<br>
<br>Later in 1925 Eldridge returned to Paris to focus on building his new cars, the Eldridge-Specials. These vehicles claimed numerous records at the Montlh&eacute;ry autodrome, whose potential as a venue for record-breaking attempts was recognized by Eldridge. In November 1925 he took the world's 50 km record there, at a speed of 116.43 m.p.h. In 1926 Eldridge and his compatriot Douglas Hawkes drove the cars in the Indianapolis 500, finishing nineteenth and fourteenth respectively. Soon afterwards Eldridge purchased the Indianapolis Miller in which Harry Hartz had claimed second place in the same race, with a view to modifying it for record breaking. At Montlh&eacute;ry, on 31 December 1926, he drove the Miller to the one hour record with a speed of 126.51 m.p.h. He suffered a near-fatal crash in the Miller racer on the French course in 1927, which practically ended his racing career. Travelling at over 130 m.p.h., the car somersaulted off the Montlh&eacute;ry banking and crashed in the infield. Thrown out of the car and left unconscious in hospital for ten days, he recovered, though lost the sight of his right eye.<br>
<br>Following his accident Eldridge collaborated with George Eyston, assisting with the record-breaking achievements of the supercharged MG vehicles <i>Magic Midget</i> and <i>Magic Magnette</i> at Montlh&eacute;ry. Later he designed and developed Eyston's <i>Speed of the Wind</i>, in which Eyston claimed a new twenty-four hour record of 140.52 m.p.h. at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in September 1935. The stage was set for Eldridge to collaborate with Eyston again on a land speed record attempt. Shortly after returning to England from America, however, Eldridge contracted pneumonia, dying in a nursing home, 38 Courtfield Gardens, Kensington, London, on 27 October 1935.<br>
<br>Along with Parry Thomas, Ernest Eldridge embodied the designer-driver ethos that led to the creation of remarkable vehicles for the pursuit of the land speed record. Like that of his great racing rival Eldridge's low-key personal style contrasted greatly with the visible public profiles of other record breakers such as Malcolm Campbell or Eyston. However, Eldridge's advice to the latter to pursue record breaking as it was a potentially lucrative activity revealed him to be a canny observer of contemporary developments in publicity, and as such, an influential figure within motorsport in the 1920s and 1930s.<br>
