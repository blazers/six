<span class="headword">Keyser,  William  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1647&#150;<em>c.</em>1692), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was a native of Antwerp. He was a jeweller by profession, with a large and prosperous business in Antwerp, but occupied his leisure hours:<blockquote>early &amp; late constantly studying the Art of Painting. in all kinds. in Water. in Oyl. in Enamel. in large &amp; in Small. from one degree to another. till at lenght [<i>sic</i>] he wholly applyd himself to study Painting in Oyl painting as large as Nature. (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 102)</blockquote>He executed several altarpieces for churches in Antwerp and one for the English nuns in Dunkirk while he was there &#145;upon some business relating to Jewelling&#146;  (ibid.). It pleased them so much that they persuaded him that he could make his fortune as a painter in England and provided him with an introduction to Lord Melfort, then a favourite at the court of James II. Prompted by this encouragement and his ambition to become a painter rather than a jeweller&#151;a profession that he had never liked, according to Vertue&#151;de Keyser, &#145;without giving the least notice to his wife &amp; Family at home&#146;  (ibid., 103), availed himself of a fair wind and a ship returning to England with a &#145;Friend or two on board&#146; and was soon in London. There he was well received by Lord Melfort and &#145;by many people of Quality who had known him a broad&#146; and was introduced to James II, &#145;who promis'd him encouragement in his Art&#146;  (ibid.). He decided to settle in England and concentrate on history painting, and sent for his wife and family with instructions to dispose of his business and effects in Antwerp. His timing was unfortunate, for the revolution of 1688 began soon after their arrival and de Keyser was deprived of his best patrons. He continued to work but his finances were drained by &#145;hangers on&#146; and his study of the philosopher's stone  (ibid.).<br>
<br>De Keyser died in reduced circumstances about 1692, aged forty-five. He left a daughter, whom he had educated as an artist. Her husband, a Mr Humble, &#145;woud not permitt her&#146; to paint, but after his death she showed &#145;by her performances to have had a good genius. &amp; paints. in Oyl in small, from the Life, &amp; copys paintings very curiously. &amp; neatly&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 103). She died in December 1724. Vertue, who knew her personally, stated that she had several paintings by her father, including a self-portrait and an altarpiece of St Catherine commissioned by the queen for Somerset House chapel, and others that showed him to have studied carefully the style and colouring of the Italian masters.
