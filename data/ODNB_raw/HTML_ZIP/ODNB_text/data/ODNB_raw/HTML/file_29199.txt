<span class="headword">Whetstone, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was probably the son of John Whetstone, naval officer. He was a member of Bristol corporation and master of the <i>Mary</i> of Bristol, a merchant ship trading with Virginia and Barbados. He carried a wide variety of goods including serges. He seems to have married his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1698), before 1677, in which year he took on an apprentice for seven years. He had two sons and two daughters by his first marriage; his eldest daughter, Sarah, married the naval officer Woodes Rogers. Whetstone's first wife was buried in St Nicholas's, Bristol, on 19 October 1698. On 30 July 1689, the date from which he took post, he was appointed captain of the hired ship <i>Europa</i>. For the next two years he served in Ireland convoying victuallers. He served as captain of the <i>Portsmouth</i> from 3 February to 12 August 1691. Admiral Russell described him as &#145;a good man&#146; but he was unemployed in 1692. In 1693 he was part owner of the <i>Delavall</i> privateer and the same year was given a commission to command the <i>Norfolk</i>, being built at Southampton, and also to man the ship, launched on 27 March 1693. He was discharged from the <i>Norfolk</i> on 23 May and held a series of brief commands before holding command of the <i>York</i> from 13 July 1693 to 13 June 1695.<br>
<br>Whetstone was appointed to the <i>Dreadnought</i> on 6 July 1696 and served at Newfoundland and in the channel until discharged on 13 July 1699. He was appointed to command the <i>Yarmouth</i>, from 19 May 1700 to 4 June 1701, then the <i>York</i>, with the rank of commodore and the command of the squadron to be sent out to Jamaica. The <i>York</i> was twice forced into Plymouth for repairs and, having sustained more damage on the way to Cork, was there surveyed and pronounced unfit to go to the West Indies. Consequently he moved into the <i>Canterbury</i> on 4 February 1702, on board which he arrived in May, joining Vice-Admiral John Benbow at Port Royal and taking the local rank of rear-admiral. Benbow left him to command at Jamaica while he went to look for a small French squadron expected in the area. When the squadron returned to Port Royal, Whetstone was president of the courts martial which tried the several captains who had shamefully conspired against their admiral. When Benbow died on 4 November 1702 Whetstone succeeded to the command, which he held until the following June, when he was superseded by Vice-Admiral John Graydon. He destroyed a number of privateers off San Domingo but an attempt on the French colony at Placentia was abandoned because of the weather, the island's defences, and sickness in the fleet. When Whetstone and Graydon came to leave Jamaica they were asked by the governor to leave ten ships for defence; Whetstone advised that seven should remain but in the end only four small ships were left. He returned to England in October 1703.<br>
<br>In January 1704 Prince George promoted Whetstone to rear-admiral of the blue, to show that he approved of his conduct while holding acting rank, and at the same time to separate him from charges arising against Graydon. This promotion, over the heads of other captains including Sir James Wishart, caused great offence and Sir George Rooke, with whom Wishart was serving, threatened to resign his commission unless things were put right. The matter was eventually settled by making Wishart rear-admiral of the blue, and senior to Whetstone through antedating his commission. In March 1704 Whetstone commanded a squadron in the channel. On 18 January 1705 he was promoted to rear-admiral of the white and on 17 February was appointed commander-in-chief in the West Indies, being knighted on 22 February. With his flag on board the <i>Montagu</i> he arrived at Jamaica in the middle of May. The smaller vessels under his command took several valuable prizes but his squadron was not strong enough to let him attack any Spanish settlements. To an invitation to declare in favour of King Charles, the governor of Cartagena replied that &#145;he knew no sovereign but King Philip&#146;. In 1706 Whetstone and Governor Handyside continued to try and persuade the Spanish at Cuba and Cartagena to declare for Charles and join the allied cause. Later that year William Kerr was sent out with a squadron to relieve Whetstone and, with considerable knowledge of how things stood in South America, he returned to England in December 1706.<br>
<br>In May 1707 Whetstone commanded a squadron off Dunkirk, with orders to look out for Forbin, a dangerous corsair. In June he was ordered to convoy nineteen ships of the Muscovy Company as far as the Shetland Islands. He accompanied the convoy well past the Shetlands and then parted company with them; later Forbin fell in with them and captured fifteen ships. Though Whetstone had more than fulfilled his orders, which were clearly insufficient, there was an outcry from the Muscovy Company merchants and he was tried for leaving the ships to be attacked. The Admiralty defended him and declared that the only ships which had been taken were those which had left the regular convoy and that none had been attacked until three weeks after he had left them. However, a victim was needed, and he was dismissed from his command and not employed again. He was buried in St Michael's, Bristol, on 3 April 1711 and on 7 May letters of administration were granted to his widow, Mary (or Maria) Whetstone, with whom he had one daughter, Mary. An inventory dated 30 April 1711, though badly damaged, shows that Whetstone was owed over &pound;2500 by various people.<br>
