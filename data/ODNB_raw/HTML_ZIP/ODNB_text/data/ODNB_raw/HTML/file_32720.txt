<span class="headword">Dashwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> de la Pasture]</span>,  Edm&eacute;e Elizabeth Monica</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>E. M. Delafield]</span>  (1890&#150;1943), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 9 June 1890 at 6 Walsingham Terrace, Aldrinton, near Hove, Sussex, the elder of the two daughters of Comte Henry Philip Ducarel de la Pasture (1840/41&#150;1908) and his wife, Elizabeth Lydia Rosabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bonham (1866&#150;1945). Her father was directly descended from the maharaja of Purnea, and his French grandfather had fled to England in 1791. He occupied himself with country pursuits and Catholicism, while her mother, whose father was a diplomat, wrote lucrative fiction under the name Mrs Henry de la Pasture. Edm&eacute;e, as she was called until adulthood, thereafter Elizabeth or E. M. D., was brought up in both London and Devon and later in Monmouthshire. Educated by French governesses and at several schools, she was bilingual but was &#145;allowed to read for only an hour a day&#146;  (Delafield, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 66); unsurprisingly, tyrannical mothers appear often in Elizabeth's novels. In 1910 her mother married for a second time. Her new husband was Sir Hugh Charles Clifford (1866&#150;1941), colonial administrator, and later high commissioner for the Malay States and British agent in Borneo. Edm&eacute;e, who had failed to ensnare a husband, entered a convent in Belgium, which she left after nine months, an experience she wrote about while recuperating (in a manuscript published in Powell's <span class="italic">Life</span>).<br>
<br>Elizabeth became a nurse in Exeter in 1914 and &#145;in the odds and ends of time permitted to VADs [voluntary aid detachments]&#146;  (Delafield, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 73) wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">Zella Sees Herself</span> (1917), the first of five novels with a strong Catholic element which also endorse the comment that &#145;in women novelists, the analysing habit is very frequently devoted to the study of egoism&#146;  (Johnson, 178). Like all the novels to follow, it was published under the pseudonym E. M. Delafield, a loose translation of her maiden name. <span class="italic">The War Workers</span> appeared in 1918, as did <span class="italic">The Pelicans</span> (in fact written first), which centred on the suffocating love between two sisters. Meanwhile, Elizabeth worked at the Ministry of National Service in Bristol, continuing to write &#145;as a matter of course, regardless of interruptions. &hellip; All that I have tried to do is to observe faithfully, and record accurately, the things that have come within my limited range&#146;  (Delafield, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 73, 78). The next year came <span class="italic">Consequences</span>, about a girl who enters a convent and then cannot adjust to life outside.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1919 Elizabeth was married, at St James's, Spanish Place, London, to Major (Arthur) Paul Dashwood (1882&#150;1964), the second son of Sir George Dashwood, and left for Malaya, where her husband worked as a civil engineer. In 1920 she gave birth to a son. But an expatriate life based on the club proved uncongenial and the Dashwoods returned to Britain in 1922, moving to Croyle House near Kentisbeare in Devon. A daughter was born in 1924 and her husband became a land agent, although Elizabeth's earnings were always to be essential. By now her witty, incisive style of writing was fully established, as she continued to follow her mother's advice to write &#145;about something of which I had personal experience&#146;  (Delafield, <span class="italic">Beginnings</span>, 68). Thus <span class="italic">The Way Things Are</span> (1927) concerned a woman not unlike herself, married to a husband not unlike Paul Dashwood; this was described by a contemporary as &#145;her <i>completely</i> perfect novel&#146;  (Ferguson, 166). In 1924 Elizabeth became president of the local Women's Institute, a post she retained until the end of her life. Criminology had always been an interest, and in the same year she became the first woman to sit on her local bench; <span class="italic">A Messalina of the Suburbs</span> (1924) was based on the Thompson Bywaters trial.<br>
<br>By now Elizabeth was writing a great deal of journalism&#151;&#145;she was valued for her ability to see everyday life in terms of comic desperation&#146;  (Powell, 69)&#151;and was always at work on a novel, publishing over thirty, as well as several other books of sketches, essays, short stories, and parodies, in the years between 1917 and 1943. She was on the board of <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, to which she contributed, and in late 1929 filled a space in the magazine by beginning the hugely successful <span class="italic">The Diary of a Provincial Lady</span> (1930), so characteristic of its author's self-deprecating humour and lightly satiric observation. That year, too, Elizabeth's play <span class="italic">To See Ourselves</span> was produced in London and the novel <span class="italic">Turn Back the Leaves</span> appeared. In 1932 she published probably her best book, <span class="italic">Thank Heaven Fasting</span>, &#145;an almost unbearably poignant account of the struggles of a young girl of respectable family in Edwardian times to find a husband&#151;any husband&#151;as a passport to some kind of grownup life&#146;  (Colegate). In 1937 E. M. Delafield wrote <span class="italic">Nothing is Safe</span>, a novel about the tragic effect of divorce upon children, as well as a travel book on Russia, where she had been the year before. On the outbreak of the Second World War, she lectured for the Ministry of Information and spent some weeks in France. But the death of her newly called-up son in late 1940, most probably by his own hand, was something from which she never recovered.<br>
<br>Elizabeth was described as &#145;a witty, extremely soign&eacute;e person, with a gift for laughter&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft), and her friend Lady Rhondda &#145;used to wonder how that frail looking creature could stand the strain of the unending round of never ceasing work. I suppose it would be true to say that in the end she did not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>). E. M. Delafield, a warm, kind, and generous woman completely without personal vanity, died of cancer at her home, Croyle House, near Kentisbeare, Devon, on 2 December 1943 and was buried on 6 December in Kentisbeare churchyard.<br>
