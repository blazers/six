<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waltheof</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>c.</em>1050&#150;1076), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second son of the Danish interloper <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25652/', "Siward, earl of Northumbria (d. 1055)")</script>, and his first wife, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, daughter of Earl Ealdred, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27981/', "Earl Uhtred")</script>. His mother was a member of the house of Bamburgh, which had ruled Northumbria until Cnut's reign.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandpromotion"></a>Early life and promotion</h2>Waltheof may have been born about 1050, and it was later believed that Siward intended him to rule north of the Tees. The death in battle in 1054 of a much older brother, Osbearn, made Waltheof his father's heir, but too young to succeed as earl of Northumbria when Siward himself died in 1055. King Edward instead appointed an outsider, Tostig.<br>
<br>The next ten years are a blank in Waltheof's life. Given his parentage it is likely that he spent part of his childhood at court, and he may have received some of the estates in southern England which he was holding by 1066. Later traditions recorded only that he learned the psalms by heart, which was perhaps normal for a boy of his rank. The earliest opportunity which the king had to promote him came when he was perhaps fourteen or fifteen, after the Northumbrian revolt against Tostig in 1065. Waltheof again failed to gain preferment in the north, but his father had also been earl in the south-east midlands, and there is indirect evidence that Waltheof was made earl over the shires of Huntingdon and Northampton, and possibly others (though the title &#145;earl of Huntingdon&#146; accorded him by many historians is an anachronism).<br>
<br>By 1066 Waltheof owned manors in eight counties, mostly in the east midlands (Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, and Lincolnshire), but also two big manors near London (Tottenham and Walthamstow) and the large soke of Hallamshire in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was a modest estate, but many smaller landowners throughout the east midlands had already put themselves under his protection. His influence thus extended into Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire and was most striking in Cambridgeshire, where, however, Waltheof had no manors of his own.<h2>
<a name="AngloNormanearl"></a>Anglo-Norman earl</h2>Waltheof's appointment as earl inaugurated an eventful public career. He submitted peacefully to William the Conqueror in 1066, and was among the young English aristocrats whom the new king kept at court in Normandy and England throughout 1067 and until Whitsun 1068 or later. Afterwards, however, he left court for rebellion in the north, and in the company of other Northumbrian leaders joined forces with an invading Danish fleet in 1069 to attack the king's castles in York. When William arrived in late 1069, Waltheof and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11110/', "Gospatric, earl of Northumbria")</script>, retreated from York, and in early 1070 submitted to the king on the banks of the Tees. Both were pardoned, and Waltheof not only resumed authority in his southern earldom, but married the king's niece Judith.<br>
<br>The marriage was intended to cement Waltheof into the new ruling group around William. Judith was the daughter of the king's sister Adelaide and the second of her three husbands, Count Lambert of Lens, who died in 1054, at about the time Judith was born. She had probably been brought up partly in her mother's dower county of Aumale, partly at the Norman court. She and Waltheof had two daughters, Maud and Alice (also known as Judith). Long after their father's death, Maud married first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25091/', "Simon (I) de Senlis, earl of Northampton and of Huntingdon")</script>, and then <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David")</script>, later king of Scots; Alice's husband was Ralph de Tosny.<br>
<br>Waltheof continued to acquire lands in the south of England under William I, for instance manors which the rebel Thorkell of Harringworth forfeited probably in 1069. At their full extent they may have corresponded closely to the estate which Judith still owned in 1086: some 200 rural manors mainly scattered between Lincoln, Leicester, Northampton, Bedford, and Cambridge, with houses in several east midland towns. Even so, Waltheof was nothing like as rich as the dozen or so most powerful Norman barons in England.<br>
<br>Waltheof's dealings with the great Benedictine monasteries of the fens were double-edged. Ely, Thorney, and especially Crowland all remembered him as a brother, but he bargained or stole manors from both Thorney and Peterborough, while Crowland's tradition that when Abbot Wulfketel was rebuilding the abbey church Waltheof donated the vill of Barnack, which included quarries of fine building stone, appears to have been wishful thinking. Waltheof was more generous to churches outside his immediate area of influence, especially the new cathedral church of Lincoln, on which he bestowed the valuable Huntingdonshire manor of Leighton Bromswold some time about 1072. Another beneficiary was Bury St Edmunds.<br>
<br>Waltheof also apparently played an active part in the affairs of London, demonstrated by his involvement in the transfer of the Surrey manor of Tooting from its pre-conquest owners to Westminster Abbey. The family concerned was that of Swein and his nephew &AElig;thelnoth, rich Londoners. Swein gave the manor to Waltheof; Waltheof mortgaged it to &AElig;thelnoth; &AElig;thelnoth donated it to the abbey when he became a monk, along with three houses in London and a small estate adjoining Waltheof's at Walthamstow.<br>
<br>The earl's power and standing were immeasurably enhanced in 1072, when William I expelled Gospatric from the earldom of Northumbria and gave it to Waltheof, probably by then in his early twenties. The earldom came with very large estates both north of the Tees and in Yorkshire, but was almost ungovernable in the aftermath of the king's brutality in 1069&#150;70. Waltheof had many enemies in Northumbria, not least other members of the house of Bamburgh excluded from power, and he certainly involved himself in the darker side of the region's politics, notably in a bold move in 1074 against a Yorkshire family of four brothers, the sons of Karl, which had long been the enemy of his own. Over two generations the brothers' grandfather and father had killed Waltheof's maternal great-grandfather and grandfather. Waltheof now sent his retainers to ambush them, and succeeded in murdering the two oldest brothers. The raid has long been seen as the final act in a long feud, but even at the time it must have been difficult to distinguish notions of family honour from the violence of ordinary politics. It might equally be claimed that Waltheof was acting for King William in destroying enemies who had refused to come to terms.<h2>
<a name="Revoltandexecution"></a>Revolt and execution</h2>A year later, in 1075, Waltheof himself was broken over his part in the revolt of earls Ralph of East Anglia and Roger of Hereford. His motives, even his actions, were uncertain at the time and have been contentious ever since. Waltheof certainly did not rebel openly. It may have been simply (as one later version had it) that he knew about a conspiracy against the king and was slow in reporting it, or (following another account) that he went along with the plot when it was first put to him, only to have immediate reservations and throw himself on the king's mercy, using Archbishop Lanfranc as an intermediary. Whatever the truth of the matter, the king regarded him as deeply implicated. After a trial whose decision was repeatedly postponed, and almost a year under confinement, Waltheof was hurriedly executed by beheading on St Giles's Hill outside Winchester on 31 May 1076.<br>
<br>Why the king ordered Waltheof's death is unclear. The modern view has been that he was applying to an Englishman the English penalty for treason, but that ignores the lifetime imprisonment served on Earl Morcar a few years earlier. Perhaps the king drew the line at Waltheof's second rebellion, or had simply had enough of Englishmen whose obedience was not absolute and unquestioning. Waltheof's body was thrown in a ditch, but a fortnight later, at his widow's request, Abbot Wulfketel of Crowland retrieved it for more honourable burial in the chapter house of his monastery.<br>
<br>Waltheof's dramatic end made a deep and unexpected impact upon the popular imagination. The earl was said to have spent his months of captivity as a penitent in prayer and fasting, his innocence supported by Archbishop Lanfranc. He was executed almost in secret, and the few people present evidently believed that when the sword fell during Waltheof's recitation of the Lord's prayer, his severed head voiced the final &#145;but deliver us from evil, Amen&#146;. His guilt must have been vigorously debated in the months before, with English and Normans taking opposite sides, and a widespread expectation that he would be spared. The event itself was a potent brew of treason and piety, involving an angry king, summary justice, and the frightening beheading&#151;itself unprecedented since 1066&#151;of one of the foremost living Englishmen.<h2>
<a name="Thebeginningsofthecult"></a>The beginnings of the cult</h2>The febrile atmosphere in Winchester nourished the idea that Waltheof was a martyr, even a saint. Such views were cultivated especially at Crowland, which had a financial stake in his reputation. After a disastrous fire Abbot Ingulf moved the body in 1092 from the ruined chapter house to a prominent place in the abbey church. On opening the coffin the corpse was found intact, the head rejoined to the trunk with only a fine crimson line showing where it had been cut off. The miracle was publicized by Crowland and began to draw pilgrims to the tomb.<br>
<br>Elsewhere a second centre of interest in Waltheof was apparently developing at a shrine in the nunnery of Romsey in Hampshire, not far from Winchester. Popular support there for the idea that Waltheof was a saint was stirred up by the mysterious presence in the village of a man claiming to be his son. The cult had the tacit approval of the nuns, but no consent from the bishop of Winchester. It may, for one thing, have had an unwelcome anti-Norman flavour, since in the 1090s Romsey still had close ties with the remnants of the English nobility. In 1102, having tried persuasion and failed, Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury threatened the nuns with an interdict, and sent an archdeacon to suppress the cult and drive away Waltheof's &#145;son&#146;. No more was heard of it or him.<br>
<br>The field was thus clear for Crowland to shape its own sanitized version of the cult of St Waltheof. Healing miracles began around 1111, but they were confined to the abbey precinct and largely to pilgrims from the abbey's own manors, suggesting that interest was not widespread. The author of the Hyde chronicle, writing about 1130, knew something of the story of a man whom he termed Waltheof the Gentle, still working miracles at a tomb which the chronicler could not locate. Many of the cures which Crowland recorded took place at dawn, the time of Waltheof's execution, and three-quarters of them involved the restoration of sight. The Crowland cult may at first have had undercurrents similar to those at Romsey: a visiting Norman monk denigrated Waltheof as a traitor, and was immediately struck down with an illness that proved fatal. Probably by then, however, the cult was being depoliticized by abbots anxious to play down any element of hostility to Norman rule. One sign of Waltheof's rehabilitation among the Normans is that about 1105 it was possible for his daughter Maud to give his name to her second child, whose father was a Norman baron, Simon de Senlis, and indeed whose cousin was Henry I.<h2>
<a name="Elaborationsandvariations"></a>Elaborations and variations</h2>Crowland's documentation of the cult was taken a step further perhaps in 1119, when Abbot Geoffrey, once a monk at St Evroult in Normandy, invited its historian Orderic Vitalis to come and improve the written record of the abbey's traditions. Orderic spent five weeks at Crowland and wrote an account of Waltheof and the 1075 rebellion which he later elaborated in his ecclesiastical history and which became the basis at Crowland for a thirteenth-century life and passion of Waltheof. Orderic clearly tried to make sense of Crowland's traditions about Waltheof in the light of what he already knew about the early years of Norman rule in England. As a historian and a monk with deep-rooted English sympathies, he was much taken by Waltheof's story and the monks' devotion to his memory. In his hands the 1075 rebellion took on a moral dimension, as an illustration of how earthly glory fades, albeit one interwoven with some of Orderic's characteristic prejudices. There were legitimate objections (he thought) to William I's violent and arbitrary rule, but a stronger case for fidelity to a king. Orderic gave the former side of the argument to earls Roger and Ralph, and the latter to Waltheof, whom he presented as faultless except in taking a foolish oath not to reveal the conspiracy. He pointedly contrasted a brave and contrite Waltheof with his Norman enemies and faithless wife, who between them brought about his condemnation.<br>
<br>Other historians of the early twelfth century fashioned their own versions of the fall of Earl Waltheof. Henry of Huntingdon and John of Worcester added only snippets to the bare account which they found in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, but William of Malmesbury went to the trouble of consulting the prior of Crowland, and finally decided that he agreed with the English who thought Waltheof innocent. In both his and Orderic's accounts, however, it is difficult to separate eleventh-century fact from Crowland tradition, or indeed from their own personal views. Significantly, other near-contemporaries without direct access to the Crowland tradition were much less clear about Waltheof. The Hyde chronicler's treatment of the rebellion was vague and strewn with errors, while the Norman genealogist Robert de Torigni, often precise with details of families, was badly confused about Waltheof's. Clearly by the 1130s authentic independent information about Waltheof was difficult to come by. Nor did the Crowland tradition penetrate Northumbria. Durham historians of the early twelfth century took little interest in him.<br>
<br>Meanwhile quite different stories of Waltheof's deeds, in a wholly different genre, were circulating as skaldic poetry. A single verse about Waltheof's heroic exploits during the attack on York in 1069 was known at Crowland in the twelfth century, and three more surfaced in the thirteenth in the Icelander Snorri Sturluson's masterpiece, <span class="italic">Heimskringla</span>. Since, however, the tendency in skaldic verse was for the poet to praise famous men irrespective of the facts, they cannot necessarily be regarded as containing authentic details. In any case Snorri's account of Waltheof was utterly unhistorical, making him a brother of Earl Harold, and successively leader of the English army at Gate Fulford in 1066 and hero of an improbable episode on the evening of the battle of Hastings.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsignificance"></a>Historical significance</h2>Neither the warrior hero of the skaldic tradition nor the saint of Crowland's cult can be read as an accurate representation of the young earl who was active in politics during the decade 1065&#150;75. From an early date Waltheof's life-story was made to carry the weight of different and widely divergent views on the course of late Anglo-Saxon history. A century later he passed into fiction proper when his name was selected by an educated East Anglian poet of about 1200 for the hero of the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Roman de Waldef</span>. Meanwhile the greatest importance of the real Waltheof, so often seen by historians as archetypally English, was perhaps that he was the ancestor, through his daughters, of three notable &#145;Norman&#146; families: the Senlis, the Tosnys, and the kings of Scots descended from David I.<br>
