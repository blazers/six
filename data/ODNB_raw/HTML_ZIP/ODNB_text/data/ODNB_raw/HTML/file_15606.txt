<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King,  William</span>  (1685&#150;1763), <span class="occ">college head and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was born at Stepney, Middlesex, on 5 March 1685 and baptized there six days later, the son of Peregrine King (1649&#150;1714), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1692/3), daughter of Sir William Smyth, first baronet, of Radclive, Buckinghamshire. His mother died when he was seven. Having attended the free school in Salisbury he entered Balliol College, Oxford, on 9 July 1701. At the end of an interrupted undergraduate career he was admitted a fellow commoner in June 1709, and proceeded BCL on 12 July 1709 and DCL on 8 July 1715. In late autumn 1709 he married his cousin Henrietta Maria Wither at St Anne's, Westminster; a son, Charles (1711&#150;1759), vicar of Great Bedwyn from 1748 until his death, and a daughter, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1761), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18536/', "William Melmoth (bap. 1710, d. 1799)")</script>, were the only children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Though called to the bar at Gray's Inn on 12 July 1712 King never sought practice, but he retained rights of residence in the Temple until 1747. Instead, supported by a modest patrimony he devoted himself to scholarship, literature, and politics. From about 1714 until 1722 he acted as secretary successively to James Butler, second duke of Ormond, and Ormond's brother Charles Butler, second earl of Arran&#151;who both served as chancellor of Oxford University and whose Jacobite loyalties he shared. His <span class="italic">Political and Literary Anecdotes</span> contains reminiscences of a dinner at Ormond's house in Richmond at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1715 that was attended by Jacobite leaders, including the earl of Mar, Bishop Francis Atterbury, and Sir William Wyndham. In Oxford he was on friendly terms with Thomas Hearne, the Jacobite antiquary and diarist, who recorded in 1718 that King's rooms in Balliol contained portraits of Charles I, James II, and Prince Rupert, and in 1720 that King had been proud to show him a newly struck medallion of the exiled Stuart queen Clementina. In the parliamentary election of 1722 King was chosen by the high tories of Oxford to stand for the second university seat against a sitting moderate tory, George Clarke. He resigned his post as secretary to the chancellor before contesting the election, which he eventually lost heavily, despite securing majorities over Clarke in five colleges (Corpus Christi, Exeter, Jesus, St John's, and Lincoln).<br>
<br>On 9 December 1719, following the death of Dr John Hudson, King was installed as principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford. This small institution had no fellows and no corporate body to govern it, and King, who remained principal for the next forty-four years, came to refer to it as &#145;my monastery&#146;  (Greenwood, 19). During his time as principal the east side of the quadrangle was rebuilt and a new room added to the principal's lodgings.<br>
<br>King's earliest, and longest, work&#151;a mock-heroic poem called <span class="italic">The Toast</span>&#151;appeared first in octavo in Dublin in 1732 and then, complete in four books, in a handsome quarto London edition in 1736. It has been justly described as &#145;one of the strangest and most vituperative pieces of writing which eighteenth-century England produced &hellip; an original and ingenious conception &hellip; spoilt by its author's prurience and lack of reticence&#146;  (Greenwood, 40, 357). Although he reissued the work in 1747 King later professed regret at its tone, and remaining copies were burnt at his death. It was written to relieve the frustrations of his attempt to secure the restitution of a loan of several thousand pounds to his uncle Sir Thomas Smyth, of Dublin, and his elderly and extravagant wife, Myra, the former countess of Newburgh. This lawsuit, which obliged King to make frequent and protracted visits to Ireland over a period of nearly twenty years, eventually cost King more in legal fees than the sum that he was seeking to recover, and when the matter was finally concluded, in 1746, he was only partly successful. However, it proved the instrument for establishing contact between King and Jonathan Swift&#151;to whom, as &#145;Cadenus&#146;, King dedicated the complete version of <span class="italic">The Toast</span>, in nine pages of Latin dactylic hexameters containing &#145;some of the most elegant tributes ever paid to Swift&#146;  (ibid., 57), who was equally complimentary in return. They corresponded for about five years, and Swift sought King's assistance over the publication of some of his own work. In the summer of 1737 King received a manuscript of Swift's <span class="italic">History of the Four Last Years of the Queen</span>. Concluding rapidly that the authentic text could not safely be printed, he worked effectively to postpone publication. Holding similar views about <span class="italic">Verses on the Death of Dr Swift</span>, a manuscript of which he received early in 1738, King was principally responsible for the fact that the text published by Charles Bathurst in January 1739 suffered from extensive excisions and interpolations. King's attempts to assuage Swift's displeasure failed, and their association ended. During this period King also wrote regularly for the opposition paper <span class="italic">Common Sense, or, The Englishman's Journal</span>. A satirical piece, published on 28 May 1737, was particularly notable: King proposing that the people of Britain (&#145;Corsica&#146;) should &#145;have such a King as <i>Jupiter</i> first gave to the Frogs&#146;  (ibid., 79).<br>
<br>At the same time King began to compose his first political satires in Latin verse. <span class="italic">Miltonis epistola ad Pollionem</span>, which appeared in two separate folio editions in 1738, was an extended poem in Latin hexameter dedicated to Alexander Pope and attacking the corruption of the whig government and the venality of the times. Reprinted in Edward Popham's <span class="italic">Selecta poemata Anglorum Latina</span> (1774), it was widely read. A sequel, <span class="italic">Sermo pedestris</span>, with two separate folio editions in 1739, was more academic in tone and included a striking attack on the political subservience of the contemporary episcopal bench. <span class="italic">Scamnum, ecloga</span> (1740), dedicated to George Keith, Earl Marischal, who had been attainted and exiled after commanding troops during the 1715 rising, was a grand eclogue on the preoccupations of the tory opposition. <span class="italic">Templum libertatis</span> (2 vols., 1742&#150;3), an unfinished allegorical epic in dactylic hexameter inspired by <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, was a celebration of British liberty under threat, and included a fine apostrophe to Oxford&#151;&#145;one of the most superb passages in Anglo-Latin poetry&#146;  (Greenwood, 131)&#151;and a notable description of Stowe.<br>
<br>By delivering Latin speeches on major university occasions King soon established a reputation for oratory as well as for writing. His success derived from elegance of composition, a confident delivery, and&#151;very frequently&#151;an aggressive political message. <span class="italic">Tres oratiunculae habitae in domo convocationis Oxon</span> (1743), marking the granting of honorary DCL degrees to the sixth duke of Hamilton, the third earl of Lichfield, and John Boyle, fifth earl of Orrery, contrasted the virtues and patriotic independence of the honorands with the general corruption and servility of the times. Orrery was King's literary and political associate for many years, and his notable translation of Pliny's <span class="italic">Epistles</span> owed much to King's encouragement. King's most influential speech was undoubtedly that given on 13 April 1749 at the opening of the new Radcliffe Library, designed by King's friend James Gibbs. In this speech, printed in 1749 as <span class="italic">Oratio in Theatro Sheldoniano habita idibus Aprilis, MDCCXLIX: die dedicationis Bibliothecae Radclivianae</span> and reprinted in 1750, King praised the high-tory Radcliffe trustees, among whom were three Jacobites (the fourth duke of Beaufort, Sir Walter Wagstaffe Bagot, and Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn). He went on to expound familiar themes, condemning modern luxury and invoking nostalgia for ancient virtue, and rising to an enthusiastically received peroration in which six prayers for the delivery of the nation, all commencing &#145;<i>REDEAT</i>&#146;, were generally understood to signify the restoration of the exiled Stuart family. Thomas Warton's description evokes the scene:<blockquote>
<div>See, on yon Sage how all attentive stand,<br>
</div>
<div>To catch his darting eye, and waving hand.<br>
</div>
<div>Hark! he begins, with all a Tully's art,<br>
</div>
<div>To pour the dictates of a Cato's heart:<br>
</div>
<div>Skill'd to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire,<br>
</div>
<div>He blends the speaker's with the patriot's fire;<br>
</div>
<div>Bold to conceive, nor timorous to conceal,<br>
</div>
<div>What Britons dare to think, he dares to tell.<br>
</div>(T. Warton, <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Isis</span>; Greenwood, 200)</blockquote>Ten years later, at the installation of the seventh earl of Westmorland as chancellor in July 1759, following the death of the earl of Arran, Samuel Johnson (whose MA diploma had been brought to him by King in February 1755) clapped his hands until they were sore at another virtuoso speech, which lasted fifty minutes but whose text has not been preserved.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly St Mary Hall in King's time acquired a reputation for Jacobitism. A nonjuring clergyman, John Leake, lodged there with his wife for at least three years after 1725, by special leave of the principal, and the leader of a notorious Jacobite disturbance in Oxford on the night of 23 February 1748 was an undergraduate of the college, James Dawes. Though it is unlikely that King had any direct connection with this disturbance his Jacobite convictions remained strong at the time. In 1746, after the battle of Culloden, he had described the duke of Cumberland as a man &#145;qui timet omnia praeter Deum&#146; (&#145;who is afraid of everything except God&#146;), and in September 1749 he attended the important Jacobite gathering at Lichfield races and prepared a list of 275 loyal gentlemen who were present. In September 1750 he was introduced to Prince Charles Edward Stuart at the house of Lady Primrose in Essex Street, London, although he later became disillusioned by the prince's avarice and religious duplicity. Oxford whigs&#151;such as Richard Blacow of Exeter College, John Gilbert, canon of Christ Church, Edward Bentham of Oriel, John Burton of Corpus Christi, and Robert Jenner of Trinity, all of whom were engaged in controversy with King about this time&#151;were slow to detect the waning enthusiasm for the Stuart cause that King chronicled in his <span class="italic">Political and Literary Anecdotes of his Own Times</span>, composed about 1760 but not published until 1818. King's final reconciliation with the court came in 1761, when he accompanied a university deputation to present an address of congratulation on the royal marriage and was personally introduced to George III by Lord Shelburne.<br>
<br>Despite his abjuration of Jacobitism King remained an active Anglo-Latin writer and scholar. His collected writings, <span class="italic">Opera Guilielmi King</span>, were published in 1760, and a new composition of the same date, <span class="italic">Aviti epistola ad Perillam, virginem Scotam</span>, contained significant praise for the condition of Britain under the house of Hanover. Two further short Latin works were published in 1761: <span class="italic">Elogium</span>, on Dr John Taylor, an eccentric oculist, and <span class="italic">Epitaphium Richardi Nash</span>, a long and elaborate tribute that &#145;excelled in grandeur many which had been composed in memory of sovereign rulers&#146;  (Greenwood, 311). On 8 July 1763 King made his last encaenia speech; a witness, Charles Godwyn, commented that &#145;his strength and memory, and the applause he received, were just the same as usual&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.236).<br>
<br>King died at Bath on 30 December 1763 and was buried on 5 January 1764 at Ealing, where he had succeeded his father as lessee of the rectory. His heart, enclosed in a silver urn, was deposited in the chapel of St Mary Hall, with a monument to his memory and a Latin epitaph of his own composition; it was subsequently moved to Oriel College chapel. A brief obituary in <span class="italic">Jackson's Oxford Journal</span> of January 1764 noted that King was &#145;the oldest Head of a House in Oxford&#146; and &#145;a gentleman whose Character in the polite and literary World is too well known to need any Encomium, and who was universally allowed to be the most celebrated Orator in all Europe&#146;.<br>
