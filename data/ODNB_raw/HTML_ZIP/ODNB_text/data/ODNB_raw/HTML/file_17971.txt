<span class="headword">Manning,  James</span>  (1781&#150;1866), <span class="occ">barrister and serjeant-at-law</span>, was the son of James Manning, Unitarian minister in Exeter, and his wife, Lydia, daughter of John Edge of Bristol. He acquired an early familiarity with history, antiquities, and European languages. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 23 June 1817 and went on the western circuit, of which he was for many years the leader. On 7 September 1820 he married Clarissa, daughter of William Palmer of Kimbolton, Herefordshire. Their children included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48424/', "(Elizabeth) Adelaide Manning")</script>, Froebelian and promoter of Indian education.<br>
<br>Manning's reputation rested mainly upon his learning. He was no orator, and his powers of advocacy were slight, but as a junior he obtained much business. On the basis of his knowledge of copyhold law he secured a perpetual retainer from the lord of the manor of Taunton Dean, Somerset, whose rights were the subject of continual litigation. He enjoyed the friendship of lords Brougham, and Denman, and assisted them in the defence of Queen Caroline. He was appointed recorder of Sudbury in 1835, and recorder of Oxford and Banbury in November 1837, three offices which he held until his death. He was made a serjeant-at-law on 19 February 1840, received a patent of precedence in April 1845, and was made queen's ancient serjeant in 1846. This dignity, revived at his own suggestion after long being dormant, entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords, <i>ex officio</i>, but gave him no right of speaking, unless consulted, or of voting. In March 1847 he became judge of the Whitechapel county court, from which he retired in February 1863 on a pension of &pound;700. His first wife died in 1847, and on 3 December 1857 he married again. His second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48451/', "Charlotte Manning (1803&#150;1871)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48424/', "Manning, (Elizabeth) Adelaide")</script>], widow of William Speir, was sister of the Unitarian social reformer Henry Solly, and the first mistress of the College, Hitchin, later Girton College. Manning died at 44 Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, London, on 29 August 1866. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Manning's publications included <span class="italic">Serviens ad legem: a report of proceedings &hellip; in relation to a warrant for the suppression of the antient privileges of the serjeants-at-law</span> (1840); <span class="italic">Cases in the Court of Common Pleas</span> (1841, with T. C. Granger), texts on marriage reform and parliamentary reform, and an inquiry concerning possessive augment in English and in cognate dialects. He also published volumes concerned with law reports and court practice.<br>
