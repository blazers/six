<span class="headword">Warner,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1673, <em>d.</em> 1760), <span class="occ">horticulturist</span>, was baptized on 11 January 1673 at St Giles Cripplegate in the City of London, the son of James and Mary Warner. He was eminent for his skill in growing fruit. In business as a merchant, he lived in Rotherhithe, on the east side of East Lane, where he constructed a garden which became celebrated for its products. He paid special attention to cultivating vines, and, in 1720, was the first to introduce the Burgundy grape into England. Finding that this variety, when planted against a wall, ripened earlier than others, he conjectured that the vines might ripen as standards; on trial they succeeded beyond his expectation. He considerably enlarged his vineyard, until it afforded him more than 100 gallons of wine annually, and gave cuttings from his vines to all who would plant them. When he started his experiments the only other vineyards in the country, one at Dorking and the other at Bath, were planted with grapes less suited to the English climate.<br>
<br>Warner's garden comprised several acres. A broad canal ran through the length, on either side of which were planted, besides vines, a treble row of dwarf pears and apples. He raised pineapples, then a rare fruit in Britain, on stoves, and grew other exotic plants.<br>
<br>The name of Warner's wife, who predeceased him, is unknown. He was survived by a son, Simeon, a daughter, Ann, and their children, and by a daughter Mehitabel, who had married against his wish. Warner died at Rotherhithe on 24 February 1760 and was buried in the Quakers' burial-ground in Long Lane, Bermondsey, as requested in his will, where he speaks of &#145;the Quakers, with whom I have walked in communion since my youth&#146;  (PROB 11/854, sig 129).<br>
