<span class="headword">Macdonell,  Alexander</span>  (1762&#150;1840), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic for Upper Canada and Roman Catholic bishop of Kingston</span>, was born on 17 July 1762 in Scotland, somewhere between Inverness and Fort William. His father, Angus Macdonell, was a Roman Catholic; his mother, a member of the Cameron family, was a protestant, but after her husband's death she fulfilled his wish to have their son educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood. Macdonell studied at the Scots College in Paris from about 1775 to 1777 and at the newly organized Scots College in Valladolid, Spain, from 1778 to 1787. At Valladolid on 16 February 1787 he was ordained to the priesthood.<br>
<br>From 1787 to 1791 Macdonell served as a highland missionary priest among the Gaelic-speaking Roman Catholics of Badenoch. Troubled by the economic distress of the highlands, he helped large numbers of Roman Catholic highlanders to settle in Glasgow as mill workers. Subsequently, when the mill economy slumped, he sought new employment for them by helping to form a regiment of Roman Catholic highlanders, called the Glengarry fencibles. Macdonell was appointed the chaplain of the regiment, contrary to the anti-Catholic laws in effect at that time. The Glengarry fencibles served uneventfully in Guernsey from 1795 to 1798; in Ireland, where they were located from 1798 to 1802, they took an active part in the suppression of the rebellion of 1798. When the regiment was disbanded after the peace of Amiens Macdonell's thoughts turned to schemes to help resettle the men as emigrants in Canada.<br>
<br>Macdonell arrived in Canada late in 1804. After receiving the approval of his new superior, the French Canadian bishop of Quebec, he settled at St Raphaels in Glengarry county, Upper Canada. In Glengarry and Stormont counties (thus named in 1792) in this part of Upper Canada numbers of Roman Catholic highlanders, many of them Macdonells and some of them relatives of the chaplain, had settled as United Empire loyalists in the 1780s and afterwards as emigrants directly from Scotland: Macdonell was therefore among his &#145;own people&#146;. According to legend and many printed sources, several hundreds of highlanders from the disbanded Glengarry fencible regiment accompanied him to Canada to settle in Glengarry county, but it seems likely, on the basis of the documentary evidence, that in fact only a limited number came to Upper Canada and very few to Glengarry county.<br>
<br>At the time of Macdonell's arrival there was only one Roman Catholic bishop, that of Quebec, in the British colonies of North America, and only two priests in Upper Canada. He energetically toured the province, conducting services and encouraging the founding of parishes and the building of churches. Until 1832, he said, he seldom travelled less than 2000 miles a year. At St Raphaels, which remained his home until about 1832, he built a massive stone church which was opened for services in 1826 (destroyed by fire in 1970). As a step towards establishing a diocese of Upper Canada, Macdonell was made vicar apostolic for Upper Canada in 1819 and bishop of Rhesaena <i>in partibus infidelium</i> in 1820. In 1826 he became bishop of Upper Canada with the title of bishop of Kingston or Regiopolis.<br>
<br>Since his early days Macdonell had enjoyed courting the well born and powerful, among them the distant but distinguished connections of his own relatively obscure family. In Upper Canada he was a friend of the governors and the ruling &eacute;lite; in 1830 he was named to the legislative council of the province, and he had important friends in the North West Company of fur traders. The bishop's firm toryism, which made him a pillar of the state in all emergencies, was coupled with the belief, often emphasized in his correspondence with men of power, that it was in the public interest to maintain and increase government financial support (begun just after his arrival in Upper Canada) for the growing Roman Catholic church. In the area of Scottish settlement in eastern Upper Canada he was a friend and patron of the humble, both Roman Catholic and protestant, and was always ready to lend a helping hand in case of problems with the complicated land-granting procedures. His relations with protestants, both lay and clergy, were marked by a friendliness and tolerance underlined in the memory of later generations by the long period of sectarian strife which set in soon after his death. As a highly visible public figure, loved especially by the highland Scots, who remembered him as the Big Bishop or Easbuig Mor, he merged into folklore in his lifetime, and innumerable legends and anecdotes about him survive. Macdonell was a most eloquent and emotional letter writer whose florid romanticism of literary style captured the character of the man himself. The town of Alexandria, Ontario, which grew up around a grist mill he founded about 1817, is named after him. He died at Dumfries on 14 January 1840, on one of his return journeys to Britain. The body was buried in Edinburgh, but in 1861 was removed and reinterred on 26 July in St Mary's Cathedral, Kingston, Canada.<br>
