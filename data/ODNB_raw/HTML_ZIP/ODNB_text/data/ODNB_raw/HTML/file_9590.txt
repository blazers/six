<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  William Thomas</span>  (1759&#150;1829), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in England on 13 April 1759, the son of John Austen Fitzgerald, a colonel in the Dutch service, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of Samuel Martin (<i>c</i>.1674&#150;1776) of Antigua, and sister of Samuel Martin, secretary of the Treasury. He also later claimed connection with the duke of Leinster's family. Fitzgerald was educated at the academy at Greenwich under the predecessor of Charles Burney, and then at the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre in the University of Paris. He returned to England and entered as a member of the Inner Temple and pupil of Sir Vicary Gibbs. In 1782, he obtained a post in the navy pay office as a clerk, and worked there until his retirement twenty-five years later.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald enjoyed writing, although his enthusiasm was more pronounced than his talent. As the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> put it: &#145;his pen seized every opportunity of proving that his heart was as loyal as his principles were constitutional&#146;  (p. 472), and his more notable productions were either prologues for plays or appeals to the loyalty and valour of England's citizens, including such works as <span class="italic">Nelson's Triumph</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Tears of Hibernia Dispelled by the Union</span> (1802), and <span class="italic">Nelson's Tomb</span> (1806). More characteristically spirited, however, were two 1803 productions: <span class="italic">&#145;Britons never shall be slaves!!&#146; Address to every loyal Briton on the threatened invasion of his country</span>, and <span class="italic">Britons! to Arms!!</span> Works of this sort executed in Fitzgerald's passionate manner left him open to criticism, and it is likely that his claim to fame will remain the parody &#145;The Loyal Effusion&#146;, found in James and Horace Smith's <span class="italic">Rejected Addresses</span> (1812). William Cobbett called Fitzgerald &#145;The Small Beer Poet&#146;, and it is to Fitzgerald that Byron refers in the first couplet of <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> (1809):<blockquote>
<div>&#151;Still must I hear?&#151;shall hoarse Fitzgerald bawl<br>
</div>
<div>His creaking couplets in a tavern hall?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Fitzgerald bore all of this parody in the best of humour. His enjoyment in rousingly reciting his poetry continued, and his recitals were warmly received at the annual public dinners of the Literary Fund, of which he was one of the earliest and strongest supporters, and for which he acted as vice-president. In 1814 he issued a collected edition of his verses in denunciation of Napoleon Bonaparte.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald died at Paddington on 9 July 1829, survived by his wife, Maria, and at least three sons and two daughters.<br>
