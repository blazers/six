<span class="headword">Blackburne,  Anna</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Orford Hall, north of Warrington, Lancashire, the fifth of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2515/', "John Blackburne (bap. 1694, d. 1786)")</script>, horticulturist, and Catherine Ashton (1701&#150;1740). She was baptized (as Anne) in Warrington on 3 January 1726 and grew up at Orford Hall, where her family had held estates for three generations. Following the early death of her mother Anna took on central responsibilities at Orford Hall and also joined her father in scientific activities. John Blackburne established an extensive, much-admired garden that was filled with aquatic plants, fruits, hardy exotics, and hothouse specimens such as pineapples. Anna developed a well-known natural history collection. She did not marry, but was widely known as Mrs Blackburne. She received naturalist visitors such as Thomas Pennant, corresponded widely with Linnaeus and other naturalists at home and abroad, and exchanged plants, minerals, and specimens of birds with other collectors including Peter Simon Pallas. When the German naturalist and traveller Johann Reinhold Forster was tutor in natural science at the educationally progressive Warrington Academy, 1767&#150;70, he regularly dined at Orford Hall and read his entomology lectures to her.<br>
<br>Anna Blackburne taught herself Latin so that she could study the Linnaean classification system. In his <span class="italic">System of Vegetables</span> Erasmus Darwin called her &#145;learned and ingenious&#146;. On 29 July 1771 she wrote to Linnaeus in Uppsala and offered to send him North American birds and insects collected by one of her brothers, Ashton Blackburne, near New York. Linnaeus replied that he knew of her already, as one of &#145;three botanical ladies&#146; who &#145;disputed in 1769 with and triumphed over the botanist in the physic garden at Oxford about the geranium&#146;  (Wystrach, 153). The two corresponded in the early 1770s; Linnaeus praised her as &#145;a true naturalist whose esteem I covet&#146;  (ibid., 155).<br>
<br>At Orford Hall, Anna Blackburne assembled a large and notable museum of natural history that contained specimens of plants, birds, shells, insects, fish, and minerals. Her collection rivalled the museums of natural history established by her cousin Sir Ashton Lever in Manchester and London. After her father's death, in 1787 she moved to Fairfield, a new house closer to Warrington, in which one large room was designed for her collection of birds and other natural curiosities. She planned to organize the garden according to the Linnaean system but ill health interfered with the project. She died on 30 December 1793, and was buried in the family plot at Winwick, Lancashire. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary celebrated her as &#145;sincere and hospitable, of open, candid, and unaffected manners, with a truly good heart, and a clear head&#146;. The plant genus <i>Blackburnia</i> an Australian shrub, and the Blackburnian warbler (<i>Dendroica fusca</i>) were named in her honour by Pennant and Forster. Bequests to her family and various charities totalled some &pound;12,000.<br>
