<span class="headword">Pirow,  Oswald</span>  (1890&#150;1959), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in South Africa</span>, born at Aberdeen, Cape Colony, South Africa, on 14 August 1890, was the eldest of three children. His German parents, Carl Bernhard Ferdinand Pirow (<i>d</i>. 1930), the son of a missionary, and his wife, Henrietta Jasmine Marine (Henny) Tomby, went to South Africa in 1888. Pirow's schooling began at Potchefstroom, Transvaal, where his father practised medicine. For further study, Pirow proceeded to the Itzehoe Gymnasium in Germany, then to London to read law, being called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1913. After returning to South Africa he practised as an attorney, and in 1915 transferred to the Pretoria bar. His effectiveness as an advocate soon won wide recognition, and in 1925 he took silk. In 1919 Pirow married Else (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of Albert Piel, the founder of a cold storage concern; there were two sons and two daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>As one of the Afrikaner &#145;Young Turks&#146; of Transvaal under Tielman Roos, Pirow had meanwhile entered politics. He supported J. B. M. Hertzog and his National Party. After three unsuccessful attempts, dating from 1915, Pirow entered parliament in 1924 as the member for Zoutpansberg. At the next general election in 1929 he unsuccessfully opposed J. C. Smuts in Standerton. After Roos's resignation from the cabinet later in 1929, Hertzog invited Pirow to take his place as minister of justice. Following a spell as a nominated senator, Pirow, in a by-election in October 1929, was returned to the assembly for Gezina, the constituency which he continued to represent until 1943.<br>
<br>Pirow supported Hertzog in negotiating the coalition with Smuts in 1933. He also approved the fusion of the National and South African parties in 1934. In the new government he held the portfolios of defence and of railways and harbours. With Smuts and N. C. Havenga he was also a member of Hertzog's &#145;inner cabinet&#146;. Recognizing Pirow's parliamentary skills, Hertzog delegated to him the piloting of several important measures, notably the <span class="roman">Status Act</span> of 1934. Pirow, who was a keen amateur flyer, founded South African Airways in 1934, equipping it with German Junker aircraft. Peripatetic by temperament, he was actively interested in the union's external affairs. Seeking solidarity with the local white settler communities, he strove to strengthen South Africa's influence in central and east Africa. Although he was discredited after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 by Smuts's mockery of his notorious &#145;bush carts&#146;, Pirow was an able administrator and his stewardship of the defence ministry had not earlier been attacked.<br>
<br>An admirer of Hitler after meeting him in 1933, Pirow, always aggressively anti-communist, saw Germany as the bulwark against Bolshevism in Europe and the world. In October 1938 he began a tour of western Europe. Mainly on his own initiative, and without Neville Chamberlain's backing, Pirow assumed the role of an informal mediator with Hitler. He subsequently claimed that at Berchtesgaden in November he sounded Hitler on an offer of a free hand in eastern Europe in return for an undertaking to allow the German Jews to emigrate. Pirow's tour, during which he also met Mussolini, Salazar, and Franco, profoundly affected his outlook. He returned to South Africa convinced that in the approaching war the forces of national socialism, to which he was shortly to announce his conversion, would triumph.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war Pirow supported Hertzog after his defeat in parliament and resignation on the neutrality issue, and in his later reunion, in the Herenigde Nasionale Party (HNP), with the &#145;Purified&#146; Nationalists of D. F. Malan who had declined to enter fusion in 1934. At the end of 1940, when Hertzog and Havenga broke with the HNP, Pirow remained in the party and in parliament. In September 1940 he launched his New Order for South Africa, a movement based on the Nazi ideology of race and on a rejection of parliamentary democracy. For a time he tried to keep his group within the HNP on the basis of a common republicanism; but the condemnation of national socialism by Malan and J. G. Strijdom forced Pirow and his followers to quit the HNP caucus in January 1942. In the general election of 1943 supporters of the New Order were eliminated, while Pirow himself declined to stand for re-election. He continued to propagate his views in his newsletter until 1958, but his political influence had disappeared long before.<br>
<br>After leaving parliament Pirow resumed his practice in Pretoria. He retired in 1957, but re-emerged later in the year when he was briefed by the crown in the Pretoria treason trial&#151;a tribute as much to his consistent advocacy of uncompromising white supremacy as to his legal skills. The trial was still in progress at the time of his death from cardiac failure in Pretoria on 11 October 1959. His ashes were interred at his home, Valhalla Farm, near Pilgrim's Rest, Transvaal.<br>
<br>At the height of his career in the thirties Pirow's ability and energy had marked him out as Hertzog's lieutenant and possible successor. Turbulent in spirit, brusque, dynamic, and combative, Pirow was a vigorous personality. A notable athlete in youth and a keen hunter, he was also a prolific writer, his most serious work being his biography of Hertzog (1958). After the early promise, Pirow's political eclipse, with its note of wasted talent, reflected not only his misjudgement of the course of world events and of Afrikaner political proclivities in a crisis, but also a streak of undisciplined opportunism in his own character.<br>
