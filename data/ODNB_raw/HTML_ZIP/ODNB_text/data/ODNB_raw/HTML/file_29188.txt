<span class="headword">Wheeler,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">secretary of the Company of Merchant Adventurers</span>, is of obscure origins. His supposed connection to Great Yarmouth appears to be solely the result of confusion with John Wheeler (<i>fl</i>. 1610), the member of parliament for that town. By 1589 Wheeler had joined the Society of Merchant Adventurers, the controllers of the cloth trade between England and the continent, and was the secretary by 1601. In that year the privy council granted freedom of trade to the two Hanseatic League cities of Hamburg and Stade, and Elizabeth granted a ten-year licence to the earl of Cumberland for the export of &#145;white&#146; or unfinished cloth. Both these grants threatened to undermine the arrangements made by the society to regulate the cloth trade and to keep in check its German rival, the Hanseatic League. In April 1601 Thomas Milles distributed his tract <span class="italic">The Customer's Apology</span>, which attacked the society and its supposed monopolistic practices.<br>
<br>Within two months Wheeler had written and published his 40,000-word reply, a strongly worded defence of the society entitled <span class="italic">A Treatise of commerce wherein are showed the commodities arising by a well ordered and ruled trade such as that of the Society of Merchants Adventurers is proved to be, written principally for the better information of those who doubt the necessities of the said society in the state of the realm of England</span>. The prefatory dedication was signed by Wheeler on 6 June 1601 in Middelburg in Zeeland, then the society's base on the continent, and it is there that the first edition was printed. The second edition appeared in London later in the month. An eight-page draft of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, possibly in Wheeler's hand, is in the Public Record Office.<br>
<br>Written to persuade the English government and merchants of the value of the society and to convince the friends of the Hanseatics that they would not be reinstated in England, the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> proved to be a most successful piece of propaganda. Although much of the historical background and even some of the statistics were taken from George Nedham's 1565 &#145;Letter to the earls of East Friesland&#146;, in the absence of other records, Wheeler's account of the society's development over the centuries provided such detail that it remains the principal source for the history of the Merchant Adventurers. His draft begins: &#145;The traffick of this land hath been managed under the government of a companie almost 400 years, first in the staple and wool trade and next in the M. Adventurers and cloth trade&#146;  (&#145;John Wheeler's treatise&#146;, 167). The stability given to the trade by this management was such &#145;that the State and Commonwealth hereby reapeth more profit than if men were suffered to run a loose and irregular course without order, command or oversight&#146;  (Hotchkiss, 341). The allegation that the society was a monopoly was &#145;a slander and injurious imputation, maliciously devised by the Hanses&#146;, behind whom were the Spanish, whose object was &#145;through the side of the Merchants Adventurers to hurt and wound the state of England&#146;  (ibid., 73).<br>
<br>In 1602 Wheeler was considered the natural successor to George Gilpin in the important diplomatic post of councillor to the council of estate in the Low Countries, but he nevertheless remained in the society's employ. Christopher Hoddeson, the governor of the society, wrote of him:<blockquote>The man is wise and honest, hath a sharp sight and quick conceit to prevent any mishap, is of good estimation and long acquainted with the manners of the Netherlanders. He hath their language, Latin and French as perfect as English, with a good taste of Italian and Greek. He is not sparing of his pen, [and] hath good advertisements from Prague, Cologne and other places of far remote matters. (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 12, 390)</blockquote>In 1608 Wheeler prepared <span class="italic">The lawes customes and ordinances of the fellowshippe of Merchantes Adventurers of the realm of England collected and digested into order by John Wheeler</span>. Although the original is now lost, a contemporary copy is in the British Library. In 1609 a new ordinance was added to forbid marriage with foreign-born women, which Wheeler himself transgressed, and he was disfranchised from the society until February 1612.<br>
<br>Following privileges given to the Merchant Adventurers by the city of Hamburg in 1612, the chief seat of the society moved there. Wheeler, who opposed the move, stayed on in Middelburg, partly because of the threat posed by the interlopers in the Netherlands. The Merchant Adventurers' control of the cloth trade had been weakened because, he wrote, &#145;Amsterdam, in maintaining the interloperie, sucketh the very heart blood from us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 122).<br>
<br>In 1614 Alderman William Cokayne, perhaps the wealthiest and most influential of London merchants, threw the cloth trade into crisis. Through his persuasion, the king suspended the society's charter on 2 November 1614, and arranged the grant of a new charter to the King's Merchant Adventurers of the New Trade of London on 29 August 1615. Cokayne's intention was to foster in England the trades of dyeing, dressing, and finishing woollen cloth in England so as to compete with both the Merchant Adventurers in the export of cloth and also the foreign manufacturers of finished cloth. It was an idea that Wheeler had himself tested in 1612 by ordering the export of coloured cloths to Antwerp as an experiment to find out the reaction of authorities there. Although Wheeler was initially unwilling to join the new venture, the crisis deepened and, after holding out for eight or nine months, he joined the King's Merchants. The new project did not prosper against the opposition of the society and the foreign markets, and great damage was done to the cloth trade. On 1 January 1617 the king restored the society, and on 9 January the King's Merchants surrendered their charter. Wheeler was dismissed by the Merchant Adventurers after twenty-seven years' service and died within the year, in 1617. The society contributed &pound;50 towards the upkeep of his orphans.<br>
