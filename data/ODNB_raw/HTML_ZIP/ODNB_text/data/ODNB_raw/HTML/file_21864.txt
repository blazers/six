<span class="headword">Pennefather,  Edward</span>  (1773&#150;1847), <span class="occ">judge</span>, of Rathsallagh, Dunlavin, co. Wicklow, was born on 22 October 1773, the second son of Major William Pennefather (1732&#150;1819), of Darling-Hill, co. Tipperary, MP for Cashel, and Ellen, eldest daughter of Edward Moore DD, archdeacon of Emly. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21867/', "Richard Pennefather (1772&#150;1859)")</script> and was educated with him at Portarlington and Clonmel schools; he graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, as BA in 1794, and MA in 1832. He had entered the Middle Temple, London, in 1792, and was called to the Irish bar three years later. On 6 January 1806 he married Susan (1785&#150;1862), eldest daughter of John Darby of Markly, Sussex, and of Leap Castle in King's county; they had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>The &#145;two Pennefathers&#146; were leading practitioners at the court of chancery when Francis Blackburne (afterwards lord chancellor of Ireland) began to practise. Edward excelled his elder brother, Richard, as an advocate, and was without a rival as an equity lawyer.<br>
<br>Pennefather appears as king's counsel in 1816, and in the same year he was counsel for the plaintiff in the celebrated libel case, <i>Bruce v. Grady</i>, tried before Serjeant Johnson at the Limerick summer assizes of 1816, when O'Connell led for the defendant (<span class="italic">Authentic report of the interesting trial for a libel contained in the celebrated poem called The Nosegay</span>). The plaintiff, who claimed &pound;20,000, obtained a verdict for &pound;500.<br>
<br>Elected a bencher of King's Inns in 1829, Pennefather was appointed third serjeant in April of the following year, second serjeant in January 1831, and first serjeant in February 1832. On 27 January 1835 he became solicitor-general for Ireland in Sir Robert Peel's administration, and he was reappointed (in September 1841) on the return of Sir Robert Peel to power. In November he was appointed chief justice of the queen's bench and a privy councillor. In January and February 1844 he presided at the state trial of the O'Connells, Gavan Duffy, and their associates for conspiracy to effect the repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. The trial was the great legal event of the Peel administration, as memorable for its magnitude and longevity as for its political importance. John Mitchel says that &#145;the chief justice in his charge argued the case like one of the counsel for the prosecution&#146;  (J. Mitchel, <span class="italic">A History of Ireland from the Treaty of Limerick</span>, 1869, 194). Pennefather contended that neither secrecy nor treachery formed a necessary part of the legal definition of conspiracy. His charge was learned, lucid, and fair, although it was clear that in the opinion of the court the indictment had been in the main sustained. Sentence was pronounced on 30 May by Mr Justice Burton.<br>
<br>Pennefather retired from the bench in January 1846 and died at his house in Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, after a long illness, on 6 September 1847. He was buried in the churchyard of Delgany church.<br>
<br>Although in his day Pennefather stood at the head of the Irish bar, he was nevertheless a man of unwavering modesty. A weighty advocate, in stature he was compared by James Whiteside to the great English lawyer, Lord Romilly.<br>
