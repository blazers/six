<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macheth family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1124&#150;1215), <span class="occ">rebels</span>, took part in revolts against four successive kings of Scots over some ninety years. Their first known representative, <a name="cosubject_62764"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm Macheth</span>, earl of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1168)<span class="occ"></span>, may have rebelled in 1124 against King David I. He was certainly &#145;out&#146; in 1130 with Angus, earl of Moray, who claimed the Scottish throne as a descendant of King Lulach (<i>d</i>. 1058); they were defeated, and Angus killed, at Stracathro. In 1134 Malcolm again rebelled and David I sought and may have received Norman help; in the same year Malcolm was captured and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle, where he spent the next twenty-three years. There were no more rebellions against David I for the rest of his reign.<br>
<br>The ancestry of Malcolm Macheth and the reasons for his revolts have been variously explained. Orderic Vitalis describes him as the illegitimate son of Alexander I, but although Orderic is usually reliable, this seems unlikely. Ailred of Rievaulx, writing of the wars of 1138, refers to him as &#145;the heir of his father's hatred and persecution&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Scottish Annals</span>, 193), a phrase which has been taken to mean that he was the son of Angus of Moray. John Fordun, writing in the fourteenth century, asserts that he claimed, falsely, to be Angus's son, an assertion which misled later historians into confusing Malcolm with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50011/', "Wimund")</script>, bishop of the Isles, who undoubtedly contended that he was the son of Angus. But all these suggestions ignore the problems raised by Malcolm's patronym, and it seems more likely that he was the son of an Earl Aed 
    (Heth; <i>d</i>. before 1130?)
   recorded early in the twelfth century, who may have held the earldom of Ross. A family link with Earl Angus is possible, but cannot be proved. However it was derived, Malcolm's eminence is clearly demonstrated by his marriage, in or before 1134, to a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26782/', "Somerled, lord of Argyll")</script>; it may also explain his later imprisonment, since the usual fate for defeated rebels was execution. David I's mercy, or political judgement, could have been decisive in this, however, for Malcolm's rebellious descendants were not treated so leniently.<br>
<br>Malcolm's sons (their exact number and, with one exception, names are not known) joined Somerled in his revolt against Malcolm IV late in 1154; one son, <a name="cosubject_62765"></a><span class="headword">Donald Macheth</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1156)<span class="occ"></span>, was captured at Whithorn in 1156 and sent to join his father at Roxburgh. In 1157 Malcolm Macheth was reconciled with the king and was probably loyal thereafter. He was granted the earldom of Ross, which he held from 1162 at the latest until his death in 1168.<br>
<br>King William the Lion appointed no successor as earl; nothing more is known about Malcolm Macheth's sons except that Donald had a son, <a name="cosubject_62766"></a><span class="headword">Aed Macheth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1186)<span class="occ"></span>, who kept alive the family claims. Ross was a focus of unrest, probably from Macheth activity, in 1179; by 1181 a major rising was well under way, led by Donald Ban of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49357/', "Macwilliam family")</script>, with whom the Macheths were often associated thereafter. Aed, son of Donald Macheth, took part; by now an outlaw, with an unnamed nephew and fifty-eight followers he was trapped and killed at the abbey of Coupar Angus in 1186.<br>
<br>After the defeat of the Macwilliams at &#145;Mam Garvia&#146; on 31 July 1187 the Macheths were quiet for nearly ten years. Malcolm Macheth also had a daughter, <a name="cosubject_62767"></a><span class="headword">Hvarflod Macheth</span>, countess of Orkney and Caithness  (<em>fl. </em>1196)<span class="occ"></span>, the bigamous second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49351/', "Harald Maddadson, earl of Orkney and Caithness (1133/4&#150;1206)")</script>. She was thus the sister-in-law of Malcolm, earl of Atholl, who had been responsible for the death of her nephew Aed in 1186; she is said to have instigated the revolt of Earl Harald against King William in 1196. In 1197 Thorfinn Haraldsson, the earl's son from his first marriage, was defeated in battle near Inverness and Harald was captured and put in Roxburgh Castle; having made his peace with the king, he then left Thorfinn as a hostage in his place. About 1201, after further troubles in Caithness, Thorfinn was blinded and emasculated and died later in prison. John and David, the sons of Harald and Hvarflod, were recognized as earls of Orkney and Caithness after Harald's death. Perhaps warned by Thorfinn's fate, neither pressed any claims based on their Macheth blood. David died, apparently childless, in 1214; John (<i>d</i>. 1231) succeeded as sole earl, and King William in the last months of his reign went to Moray and received John's (unnamed) daughter as a hostage. Her fate is not known; nor is the date of death of her grandmother Hvarflod.<br>
<br>The Macheths may have been responsible for the invitation from the lords of Ross which encouraged Guthred Macwilliam's invasion in 1211. If so, at least one survived Guthred's defeat in 1212, since Aed's son, <a name="cosubject_62768"></a><span class="headword">Kenneth Macheth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1215)<span class="occ"></span>, took part in the next Macwilliam rising in 1215, when the rebels invaded Moray (more likely Ross). They were defeated in May or June and their severed heads, including Kenneth's, were presented to Alexander II on 15 June 1215. Nothing more is known of the family thereafter; a conjecture that they were the ancestors of clan Mackay is no more than that. If any were still alive their claims to Ross were denied when the earldom was granted to Farquhar Mactaggart, who had put down the rebellion of 1215, some time between 1221 and 1226.<br>
