<span class="headword">John, Sir, fitz John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1240&#150;1275), <span class="occ">baronial leader</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38271/', "John fitz Geoffrey (c.1206&#150;1258)")</script>, justiciar of Ireland, and his wife, Isabel, the daughter of Hugh Bigod, third earl of Norfolk, and the widow of Gilbert de Lacy of Meath. John fitz Geoffrey was a prime instigator, with Simon de Montfort, of the political revolution of 1258. In February 1259 John fitz John undertook to pay &pound;300 for seisin of his father's lands while still under age. He thus acquired a substantial magnate inheritance centred upon Buckinghamshire, where he was lord of Aylesbury, Whaddon, and Steeple Claydon.<br>
<br>In 1261 John fitz John, as part of the abortive attempt to prevent the overthrow of the provisions of Oxford, the revolutionary programme imposed in 1258, became sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire in opposition to the sheriff appointed by the king. Two years later he joined Simon de Montfort when the latter returned to England and reimposed the provisions. While others deserted, John fitz John remained with Montfort to the end, bringing with him several Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire knights. In July 1263 John's local influence was acknowledged and increased when Montfort's government made him keeper of the peace in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire; in December, with the other Montfortians, he accepted Louis IX's offer to arbitrate on their quarrel with the king. When Louis's verdict condemned the provisions of Oxford outright, the Montfortians refused to accept the verdict and prepared for war. In March 1264 John was involved in the seizure of Gloucester. Next month he led the pillage of the Jews in London. He killed the most famous, Kok son of Abraham, with his own hands and was less than pleased when Montfort made him share part of the spoils. John then took part in the siege of Rochester (17 April) before being knighted in London (4 May), just before Montfort marched out of the city to bring the king's army to battle. However, according to the Dunstable annals, John fitz John had been knighted earlier at Gloucester.<br>
<br>At the battle of Lewes (14 May 1264) John fitz John commanded the 2nd division of Montfort's army with Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, and William de Munchensi. &#145;He fought strenuously in the battle&#146;, the annals of Worcester recorded, &#145;smashing steel helmets and taking many of his adversaries prisoner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4.452). In Montfort's subsequent regime, although involved in negotiations with the marcher barons and with the increasingly disaffected Gilbert de Clare, John's role was in the provinces rather than at court, perhaps in part because of his comparative youth. As castellan of Windsor (from June 1264) he dragooned the local population into providing a garrison and munitions for the castle. In addition, when his brother-in-law Robert de Vieuxpont died in June 1264, he became custodian of Vieuxpont's lordship of Westmorland. After the desertion of Gilbert de Clare and the escape of Edward, the king's son, from captivity, John fitz John was with Montfort on his final campaign and was captured at the battle of Evesham (4 August 1265), being saved from death by the royalist Roger de Clifford, who had married his niece.<br>
<br>Roger de Clifford was not the only royalist to whom John fitz John was related, for he himself had married a daughter of the king's justiciar, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1643/', "Sir Philip Basset")</script>. Basset's eldest daughter, however, had married Hugh Despenser, one of Montfort's closest associates, and perhaps that tie, together with the role of his father in 1258, influenced John's political sympathies. He was also one of a group of young and warlike men (Robert de Vieuxpont and William de Munchensi were others), called contemptuously &#145;the junior boys of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4.133) by the chronicler Thomas Wykes, who were attracted to Montfort's side, quite probably by the glamour of his military reputation.<br>
<br>John fitz John's career after Evesham provides a good example of how former Montfortians could be rehabilitated. In July 1266 he was pardoned by the king for his past trespasses. Some of his lands had meanwhile been occupied and doubtless protected by royalist kinsmen&#151;by Roger de Clifford and by William de Beauchamp of Elmley, who had married one of John's sisters. The bulk of his lands had been given to Gilbert de Clare and, under the terms of the dictum of Kenilworth, had to be repurchased by John at five times their annual value. Perhaps the financial strain is reflected in John's sale of Ringwood Manor, Hampshire, for 2250 marks; but he was on good terms with Clare, and appeared as a member of his entourage in and after 1267. Later John gained the favour of Edward I and, in 1274, he represented the king at a great council at Lyons. His death (childless) in November 1275 caused grief to both king and court.<br>
<br>John fitz John had given vigorous military support to the cause of Simon de Montfort. His career permits a glimpse of both the virtues and the vices of the medieval <i>miles strenuus</i>.<br>
