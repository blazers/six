<span class="headword">Freeman,  William Peere  Williams-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>William Peere Williams]</span>  (1742&#150;1832), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29564/', "William Peere Williams")</script>, and son of Frederick Williams (<i>d</i>. 1746), prebendary of Peterborough, was born in Peterborough on 6 January 1742. His mother was Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5554/', "Robert Clavering")</script>, bishop of Peterborough, and Mary Freeman, sister of John Cook Freeman of Fawley Court, Buckinghamshire. Williams was educated at Eton College, and in June 1757 his name was entered on the books of the 100-gun <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, guardship at Spithead. He first went to sea in August 1759, in Lord Howe's 74-gun <i>Magnanime</i>, in which he took part in the battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759.<br>
<br>In September 1762 Williams followed Howe to the 80-gun <i>Princess Amelia</i>, and then joined the <i>Romney</i> (50 guns) on the Halifax station in August 1763. On 18 September 1764 he was promoted to lieutenant of the 40-gun <i>Rainbow</i> on the Virginia station, and on 26 May 1768 he was made master and commander of the <i>Thunder</i> bomb vessel. He became a post captain on 10 January 1771, with his appointment to command the <i>Renown</i> (50 guns), and moved to the 28-gun <i>Active</i> on 21 March. Shortly after, on 20 June, he married Henrietta Wilts (<i>d</i>. 1819), with whom he had two sons, one of whom was also named William Peere Williams.<br>
<br>Like so many others on that station Williams became sick while taking the <i>Active</i> to the West Indies. Apparently, he used his interest to get his ship sent to Newfoundland; his health did not, however, improve there, and on 11 October Rear-Admiral John Montagu gave him command of the <i>Lively</i> (20 guns), which he brought home and paid off in February 1774.<br>
<br>Williams's next appointment was on 10 March 1777, as captain of the 36-gun frigate <i>Venus</i>, in which he joined Lord Howe's squadron in North America, and he was with Howe at the encounter with D'Estaing's fleet off Rhode Island on 10 August 1778. Perhaps again suffering ill health, on 18 September Williams exchanged with Captain James Ferguson and took Ferguson's 32-gun frigate <i>Brune</i> back to England.<br>
<br>In April 1780 Williams took command of the <i>Flora</i>, a new 36-gun frigate carrying six 18-pounder carronades in addition to her main armament of 18- and 9-pounders. Cruising off Ushant on 10 August, the <i>Flora</i> fell in with a French frigate, the 32-gun <i>Nymphe</i> (Captain du Rumain). <i>La Nymphe</i> was the bigger ship, but the <i>Flora</i> was better armed, and in a hard-fought action which demonstrated the power and utility of the carronade, the <i>Flora</i> had 9 men killed and 17 wounded, while the French lost 55 killed and 81 wounded. A French attempt to board the <i>Flora</i> was repulsed, and Williams's men eventually boarded and took their prize.<br>
<br>In March 1781 Williams, still in the <i>Flora</i>, sailed with George Darby's fleet to the relief of Gibraltar. Returning on 30 May after escorting a convoy to Minorca, and in company with the <i>Crescent</i> (28 guns, Captain Thomas Pakenham), Williams attacked two Dutch vessels off Ceuta, the <i>Flora</i> taking on her equal in the 36-gun <i>Castor</i>, and the smaller <i>Crescent</i> engaging the <i>Briel</i>. After a 2&frac14;-hour battle, the <i>Castor</i> struck to Williams's ship, but in the meantime, the <i>Crescent</i> had been forced to strike to her Dutch opponent. The <i>Flora</i>, however, came to her assistance and chased off the <i>Briel</i>, and the two British vessels, with their prize, set off for England. Unfortunately for them, on 19 June they encountered two French 32-gun frigates, <i>Friponne</i> and <i>Gloire</i>; jury-rigged and with only 300 unwounded men (out of a full complement of 700) spread between his three vessels, Williams was in no condition to take on the French frigates, and chose to escape with the <i>Flora</i>, leaving the other two to be captured. On 30 June 1781 Lord Mulgrave described how Williams had done &#145;everything that courage could wish&#146; but had been &#145;deficient in seamanship and abilities&#146; which &#145;one would wish, both from his gallantry and connexions, not to appear publicly&#146;  (Lord Mulgrave to earl of Sandwich, NMM, SAN/F/26/116).<br>
<br>In April 1782 Williams retired to his country estates at Henley-on-Thames and Hoddesdon, adding Freeman to his name in November 1821 as a condition of his inheriting the Fawley Court estate in Buckinghamshire. Assisted in later life by his eponymous son, he amused himself in his retirement by waging an acrimonious and litigious war on his neighbours and tenants over the terms of their tenancies and the condition of their lands.<br>
<br>Williams-Freeman had continued to progress through the flag ranks, as was the custom, by sheer dint of survival, becoming rear-admiral on 12 April 1794, vice-admiral on 1 June 1795, and admiral on 1 January 1801. On 28 June 1830, on William IV's accession, he was promoted to admiral of the fleet. He died at his home on his Hoddesdon estate on 11 February 1832, and was buried in the family vault at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.<br>
