<span class="headword">Fenton,  Roger</span>  (1565&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Lancashire; while there are no details of his immediate family, several later Fentons held degrees in theology and were curates of Lancaster church. He was admitted a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1585, graduated BA in 1589, became a fellow in 1590, and proceeded MA in 1592. Here he made lasting friendships with Lancelot Andrewes and Nicholas Felton. He preached informally at Gray's Inn from 1598, and dedicated to its readers his first published work, <span class="italic">An Answere to W. Alablaster his Motives</span> (1599); the bench in turn paid the expenses for the BD he received in 1602, and formally admitted him on 9 March 1606 as preacher at the inn, a position he held until his death. From about 1600 he served as chaplain to Sir Thomas Egerton in Cheshire and London. On 18 August 1601 he was presented by the Grocers' Company to the rectory of St Stephen Walbrook (becoming a neighbour of Felton at St Antholin's), and on 29 September 1603 he was presented by the king to the rectory of nearby St Benet Sherehog. He resigned the latter on his appointment on 14 November 1606 to the vicarage of Chigwell, Essex. On 18 September 1609 he succeeded Andrewes in the prebend of St Pancras, St Paul's, which carried with it the rectory and advowson of Chigwell.<br>
<br>Among Fenton's major published works were <span class="italic">A Perfume Against the Noysome Pestilence</span> (1603), preached during a visitation of plague, and <span class="italic">A Sermon of Simonie and Sacriledge</span> (1604), an examination of the practices of the early church, delivered at Paul's Cross and dedicated to Egerton. &#145;De disciplina ecclesiae primitivae&#146; (Hunt. L., EL 1149), on the same theme, is among several major unpublished works by Fenton in Egerton's manuscript collection and dedicated to him; it is particularly significant as it has the author's Ramist subdivisions in the margins to instruct the reader in the new logic. <span class="italic">A Treatise of Usurie</span> (1611) revealed Fenton's commitment to the abolition of usury. While holding that &#145;riches are sacraments of his favor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 89), he believed that collecting interest was against the law of God where it could be documented in the scriptures and in the writings of civilian lawyers. Robert Filmer, who gave a page-by-page critique of Fenton's work, argued in <span class="italic">Quaestio quodlibetica</span> (1653) that usury was a moral question and not an article of faith, thus not sinful or unlawful.<br>
<br>An active scholar, Fenton was appointed a translator for the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> published in 1611&#151;a member of the Westminster group responsible for the translation of the epistles of St Paul and the canonical epistles from the Greek. As a theologian he placed primacy on the role of the Holy Ghost in Christianity, and in each person coming to an understanding of the Spirit's work through his own vernacular language. He believed that the true Christian must intensify the experiences of misery, search diligently to find specks of sin, and be very active in repentance. In 1613 Fenton proceeded DD. <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Anniversarie of the Companie of Grocers</span> (1615) and a collection under the title <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at St Mary Spittle</span> (1616), reveals that he preached on various notable city occasions, including funerals. <span class="italic">A Treatise against the Necessary Dependence upon that One Head, and the Present Reconciliation to the Church of Rome</span> (1617), compiled by Emmanuel Utie and published after Fenton's death, comprises a number of Fenton's sermons before the king and at Paul's Cross.<br>
<br>Fenton died on 16 January 1616 and was buried under the communion table at St Stephen Walbrook; his friend Felton preached the funeral sermon. His epitaph speaks of him as dying prematurely, and the parish erected a monument to mark the community's loss. The father of Thomas Fuller, the ecclesiastical historian, regarded Fenton as painful, pious, and learned. According to Utie he was admired as both preacher and writer, and noted for his &#145;naked innocencie without affection, and the naturall majestie of the style, like a Master Bee without a sting&#146;  (Utie, sig. A2).<br>
