<span class="headword">Bisset,  James</span>  (1762?&#150;1832), <span class="occ">artist and writer of verse</span>, was born in Perth, the son of a merchant. He received his early education at a dame-school. He developed early a love of art and literature and from the age of nine began regularly to take the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> with the help of pocket money supplied by an indulgent uncle. His father's business ventures were unsuccessful, and after learning writing, drawing, and accounts at Perth Academy, Bisset was sent to Birmingham, aged thirteen, to work for an older brother who was a merchant there.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen Bisset became an artist's apprentice at a japanning firm in Birmingham, where he spent five years learning the trade. After a period as a journeyman painter (he was listed in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Directory</span> of 1785 as a miniature painter) he began experimenting on his own account, and invented a method of painting on the inside of convex glasses, which enabled him to set up his own business. He married in 1787; with his wife, Dolly, he had ten children, four of whom survived. By 1797 he was a fancy painter in New Street. In the latter premises he established a museum and shop for the sale of curiosities. He was also a coiner of medals, and was permitted to use the designation medallist to his majesty. On the title-page of one of his books he advertised medallions of their majesties and of several leading statesmen, and a medal commemorating the death and victory of Nelson. Bisset also had great facility in composing amusing and grandiloquent verses on the topics of the day; while he obtained a considerable profit from their sale, they served to attract customers to his museum and to advertise his medals. Among his earlier volumes of verse were <span class="italic">The Orphan Boy</span>, <span class="italic">Flights of Fancy</span>, <span class="italic">Theatrum oceani</span>, <span class="italic">Songs of Peace</span> (1802), and <span class="italic">The patriotic clarion, or, Britain's call to glory: original songs written on the threatened invasion</span> (1803). The last was dedicated by permission to the duke of York, and the presentation copy to George III with Bisset's inscription is in the British Library. One of his most notable works is his <span class="italic">Poetic survey round Birmingham, with a brief description of the different curiosities and manufactures of the place, accompanied with a magnificent directory, with the names and professions, &amp;c. superbly engraved in emblematic plates</span> (1800). A second edition of the <span class="italic">Directory</span> appeared in 1808, with several additional plates, but without the <span class="italic">Poetic Survey</span>. In 1804 he published <span class="italic">Critical Essays on the Dramatic Essays of the Young Roscius</span>. In Birmingham he belonged to the Minerva Club, consisting of twelve members, nicknamed the Apostles, who met at the Leicester Arms to discuss political subjects. A picture of the members was painted by the Prussian artist Johann Eckstein; Bisset, as the oldest surviving member, fell heir to it.<br>
<br>In 1813 Bisset moved to Leamington, where he had opened a museum, newsroom, and picture gallery in the preceding year. A <span class="italic">Picturesque Guide to Leamington</span>, enlivened by stray scraps of verse, was published by him in 1814, followed by <span class="italic">Comic Strictures on Birmingham's Fine Arts and Conversaziones, by an Old Townsman</span>, in 1829. His verses also appeared occasionally in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. He boasted that he had sold over 100,000 of his different works, and that many had reached the fifteenth and sixteenth editions. He died at Leamington on 17 August 1832, and was buried there, where a monument was erected by his friends to his memory. Bisset's collection of pictures, which included several celebrated paintings, as well as some pieces by himself, was sold by auction after his death.<br>
<br>Bisset left a manuscript memoir, written in 1818 for his family, whose account both &#145;conveyed the ease with which the Birmingham manufacturer, endowed with skill, artistry, and technology, moved between the gentlemanly and industrial worlds&#146;  (Berg, 32), and illustrated the changing forms of male sociability in the period  (Davidoff and Hall, 416&#150;19).<br>
