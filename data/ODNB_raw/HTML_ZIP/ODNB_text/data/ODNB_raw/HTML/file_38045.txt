<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Symons,  Alphonse James Albert</span>  (1900&#150;1941), <span class="occ">book collector and writer</span>, was born on 16 August 1900 in Battersea, London, the eldest in the family of four sons and one daughter of Maurice (or Morris) Albert Symons (<i>d</i>. 1929), auctioneer, a Jewish immigrant from eastern Europe, and his wife, Minnie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bull. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55772/', "Julian Gustave Symons")</script> was his youngest brother. He was educated at Wix's Lane School, Battersea, and left at the age of fourteen to take up an apprenticeship to a firm of fur dealers for three years. Although declared unfit for military service, he joined the Artists' Rifles Officers' Training Corps and began an active social career. On 1 August 1924 he married Victoria Emily (Gladys) Weeks (<i>b</i>. 1897/8), the daughter of Arthur Weeks, a builder and decorator. The marriage ended in divorce in 1936; there were no children.<br>
<br>In 1922, supported initially by William Foyle, Symons had started the First Edition Club, a centre for bibliographical information and a dining club in Bloomsbury. Symons organized the selection of &#145;fifty books of the year&#146; from 1926 on and, despite the end of his First Edition Club in 1931, became an important influence in the bibliographical world through the foundation, in 1930, of the <span class="italic">Book-Collector's Quarterly</span>. Symons specialized in the authors of the 1890s but, although he worked from 1925 to 1930 on compiling &#145;A select bibliography and history of the books of the nineties, with notes on their authors&#146;, his only separate bibliographical publication in this field was a check-list of W. B. Yeats (1924). His <span class="italic">Anthology of Nineties Verse</span> (1928) was followed by a biography of Emin Pasha in the same year, and then by a life of the explorer Sir Henry Morton Stanley (1933). In 1934 came Symons's best-known work, <span class="italic">The Quest for Corvo</span>, a brilliantly evocative account of how he established the facts surrounding the life and literary career of Baron Corvo (Frederick Rolfe), the eccentric homosexual writer. The book took the form of a detective fiction, in which the author's pursuit of the baron is intertwined with his account of the baron's own life. It was an immediate success, not only for its sexual interest and its association with the notorious Maundy Gregory, but also because it was seen as &#145;an experiment in biography&#146;  (Symons, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 132), revealing as much of the biographer and of his interest in his subject as it did of the subject himself. Writing did not come easily to Symons: &#145;the act of composition has always been accompanied by more pain than pleasure&#146;  (Symons and Holland, 200), and was often neglected in favour of social engagements.<br>
<br>Symons lived a financially precarious life to the full and, in his own phrase, &#145;no one so poor has lived so well&#146;  (Symons, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 268). He favoured suits of unusual colour and cloth with double-breasted waistcoats, and &#145;extravagant shirts and ties and pointed, hand-made shoes&#146;  (ibid., 60&#150;61). He taught himself calligraphy by copying out passages from the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in a minute Gothic script. In 1931 he was associated with Andr&eacute; L. Simon in the foundation of the Saintsbury Club and, in October 1933, with that of the Wine and Food Society, the aim of which was &#145;to raise standards of cooking throughout the country&#146; and to provide &#145;practical demonstrations of the arts of the table&#146;  (ibid., 142). His many-sided aesthetic interests led him to surround himself with first editions, Bristol glass, mother-of-pearl knick-knacks, and, above all, his notable collection of musical boxes (later given to the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford). In reaction to his family, and possibly to their Jewish background, he sought an escape into social life and literary interests, his sensitivity to his first name leading him later to change it to Alroy, the name of a character in a novel by Benjamin Disraeli. His friends commonly called him AJ. He was possessed of an aggressive resolve for social success, coupled with an interest in (but not a taste for) the psychologically abnormal. An epitaph referred to &#145;kindness and culture, lovely things and mirth&#146;. Symons died of cardiac failure in the Essex County Hospital, Colchester, on 25 August 1941.<br>
