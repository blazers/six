<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stevens,  William Bagshaw</span>  (1756&#150;1800), <span class="occ">poet and diarist</span>, was born on 15 March 1756 at Abingdon, Berkshire, the elder child and only son of William Stevens (1726&#150;1788), apothecary and surgeon, and his wife, Susanna Bagshaw (1726&#150;1783); through his mother Stevens claimed kinship with the Harington family. He was educated at Roysse's Grammar School, Abingdon, until 1772, when he was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Berkshire demy. He had early shown ability: when he was a small boy his father promised him 1<i>d</i>. for every hundred lines of Virgil that he learned by heart. At Magdalen, during what were probably the happiest years of his life, his talent blossomed. In 1775 he published a volume of verse, <span class="italic">Poems, Consisting of Indian Odes and Miscellaneous Pieces</span>, dedicated to Lord North, who gave him an interview and 3 guineas in recognition of the compliment. The poems were generally well received and were apparently thought to prove Stevens's qualification for the post of assistant master to Dr William Prior, the head of Repton School, Derbyshire, after he graduated BA in 1776. Throughout his life Stevens had a gift for friendship; he and Dr Prior were soon on excellent terms, and the local grandee, Sir Robert Burdett of Foremark Hall, appointed him his domestic chaplain in 1779, after he had taken deacon's orders (he did not take priest's orders until 1798). In the same year Prior died and Stevens was appointed to succeed him as headmaster of Repton.<br>
<br>It was a promising launch in life but thereafter Stevens's career stagnated. He never married, professedly because he thought himself too poor to support a wife but really because he suffered bitter disappointment in the two great loves of his life. Sir Robert's promise to bestow a good living on his chaplain came to nothing and Stevens increasingly found his patron tiresome and tyrannical (he himself was probably too inclined to feel slighted). He hated schoolmastering, although, contrary to legend, there is no evidence that he neglected his duties and he was in constant demand as a preacher at the various churches near Repton. But the school sagged under his despondent leadership to the lowest point in its history, not entirely through his fault. He kept up his Magdalen connection, remaining a demy until 1794, when he was elected a fellow, but he rejected President Routh's offer of a tutorship, no doubt because anything to do with education had become horrible to him. He did undertake one or two minor college jobs, however, and in January 1800 he was appointed dean of divinity.<br>
<br>In 1782 Stevens published a second volume of poems but it was not a success and, except for occasional verses written for such friends as Erasmus Darwin and Anna Seward and a few contributions to periodicals (the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Topographer</span>, edited by his former pupil Stebbing Shaw), he never ventured into print again. His ambitions narrowed to securing church preferment but it was not until the last year of his life that, through the good offices of his devoted friend Sir Francis Burdett, Sir Robert's grandson and heir, and of Thomas Coutts, Burdett's father-in-law, he attained a rectory (Seckington) and a nearby vicarage (Kingsbury) in Warwickshire. His health had been failing for some years&#151;he complained much of gout&#151;and on 28 May 1800 he died at Repton from an apoplexy brought on, says tradition, from immoderate laughter at the antics of an Italian and his monkey in the village high street. On hearing the news Francis Burdett wrote to Stevens's sister that it was an irreparable loss, leaving a void in his mind that could never be filled. Stevens was buried in Repton churchyard.<br>
<br>Stevens was a better poet than his contemporaries knew. Some of his verse was still unpublished 200 years after his death, but, if the whole of it is read, he emerges as a man of real talent, humour, wit, and feeling, though trapped in the limbo of poetic diction that the great Romantics would soon blow apart. He was especially devoted to the work of that earlier Magdalen poet William Collins. But his fame now rests on the journal that he kept from 1791; its publication by Georgina Galbraith in 1965 permanently altered Stevens's position in the history of English literature. It is as valuable to historians as the contemporary diary of James Woodforde and, like Woodforde, presents a vivid picture of a corner of rural England in the late eighteenth century; unlike Woodforde it also records a man's inner life, above all in its account of Stevens's hopeless love for the young, rich, highly-strung, and beautiful Fanny, Thomas Coutts's second daughter, who married the marquess of Bute four months after Stevens's death. In his minute depiction and analysis of situations and emotions Stevens shows the talent of a novelist&#151;a Richardson rather than a Jane Austen; the secret drama of a quiet life has seldom been more painfully displayed. The journal is also an essential source for the early life of Francis Burdett.<br>
