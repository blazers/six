<span class="headword">William of Ypres</span>, styled count of Flanders  (<em>d.</em> 1164/5), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the illegitimate son of Philippe de Lo, the younger son of Robert (I), count of Flanders (<i>d</i>. 1093), and brother of Count Robert (II) (<i>d</i>. 1111). Although the episode of his involvement in English affairs between <i>c</i>.1137 and 1154, when he was a leading supporter and military commander of King Stephen, and acted as the effective governor of Kent, is distinct both from his earlier career in Flanders, and from his retirement there from <i>c</i>.1154&#150;5 until his death, that involvement is only explicable in relation to his Flemish origins, and against the more general background of close Anglo-Flemish relations after 1066.<h2>
<a name="Familybackground"></a>Family background</h2>William's date and precise place of birth are unknown. His father Philippe's estates lay around Lo, north of Ypres, and Philippe attested charters as count of Ypres. He is not known to have married and there is no doubt that William was considered illegitimate. Among contemporary chroniclers, Suger calls him William the Bastard  (Suger, 248&#150;9); Galbert of Bruges quotes a letter of Louis VI dismissing him as &#145;illegitimate, born of a noble father and an ignoble mother who continued to card wool as long as she lived&#146;  (Galbert, 187); and the St Bertin chronicle, not a hostile source, says he was Philippe's son by a concubine. The name of William's mother is unknown. His birth has been placed <i>c</i>.1090, but that is only a conjecture, and dates later in the 1090s are equally plausible. Chronicles mention William's marriage by 1119 to a niece of Clemence of Burgundy, the wife of Robert (II) of Flanders, but give no further information. Two brothers of William are mentioned in passing: Theobald Sorel, referred to by Galbert of Bruges in 1127, and Reenger who witnessed a charter with William in 1139&#150;40. Leliosa, whom William called his kinswoman in a charter of 1162, was the daughter of Theobald d' Aire, possibly Theobald Sorel. No children of William himself are documented.<h2>
<a name="ThestruggleforFlanders"></a>The struggle for Flanders</h2>William did not inherit his father's comital title, appearing in a charter of 1118 just as &#145;William son of Count Philippe&#146;. But when his cousin Baudouin (VII), count of Flanders, died without issue in 1119, William was the only surviving grandson of Robert (I) in a male line, and there was a movement to install him as count, led by Clemence of Burgundy and her second husband Godfrey, duke of Brabant. Baudouin had nominated another cousin, Charles, the son of Robert (I)'s daughter Adela and Cnut IV, king of Denmark, as his successor, and Charles soon defeated the challenge to his rule. In this episode William may have been a figurehead manipulated by others, especially given his link by marriage to Clemence. He survived the crisis, and assumed a prominent position under the new count as effective count of Ypres and its regions, like his father. A much greater upheaval followed the death of Count Charles the Good. Charles was murdered while at prayer in Bruges on 2 March 1127 by members of the Erembald clan, a large family of knights and officials who feared the loss of their power at the count's hands. William at once demanded that men under his control swear allegiance to him as count, and occupied much of western Flanders. Of the two vivid contemporary chronicle accounts, Galbert of Bruges says that he acted &#145;on the advice of the murderers&#146;  (Galbert, 133&#150;4), and that he claimed falsely to have the support of Henry I of England; Gautier de Th&eacute;rouanne states more neutrally that he wished to secure order. As the Erembalds and their enemies fought in Bruges, William severed any links he may have had with the murderers, and by 20 March had executed one of their leaders who fell into his hands.<br>
<br>But William's bid for power failed, partly because of the intervention of Louis VI of France, who came to Arras to nominate his own candidate, William Clito, son of Duke Robert of Normandy and descendant of the Flemish ruling house through his grandmother Matilda, sister of Robert (I) and wife of William the Conqueror. Clito garnered the support of many Flemish nobles by the end of March, and the towns of Bruges and Ghent also received him, in return for enhanced privileges. By April 26 he was strong enough to attack Ypres, the townsmen admitted him, and his rival was captured. The fortunes of William of Ypres reached their nadir in September, when he was brought to Bruges as a captive, while an inquest was conducted to identify those involved in the murder of Count Charles. Perhaps William's condemnation was seriously considered, but if so he escaped implication, and was released in return for an oath of loyalty to Clito in March 1128. Clito had alienated many of his initial supporters and faced opposition from a new claimant, Thierry d'Alsace, son of Gertrude, another of Robert (I)'s daughters. In July 1128 Clito was killed at the siege of Aalst, there was another shift of allegiances, and Thierry was confirmed as count. William of Ypres then launched a final revolt in the Ypres region about 1130, though the course of events is obscure and his motives are unknown. It is only clear that he failed and was eventually forced into exile by <i>c</i>.1133&#150;5.<h2>
<a name="MakingacareerinFlandersandEngland"></a>Making a career in Flanders and England</h2>Studies of the early career of William of Ypres have generally portrayed him as a ruthless opportunist, abandoning his distasteful Erembald allies only when they were doomed to defeat. Yet William's initial reaction of consolidating his own power base as disorder spread was not unreasonable, and his changed attitude to the murderers must have followed very quickly on his receiving fuller information of their deeds in Bruges. His bid for the succession would always have been opposed, however he pursued it, not least by Louis VI who must have regarded him as a potential ally of Henry I of England. William certainly had a substantial political following in 1127: Galbert concedes that he led 300 knights, and that many of Count Charles's household had joined him. This must be seen as a tribute to his lordship and capacity to build up support, not just his ambivalent family inheritance. Some of these men must have followed him into exile, though few names are known. The ultimate failure of William's political ambitions in Flanders by 1135 does not therefore prove that he was especially unprincipled or that he lacked ability.<br>
<br>It is generally assumed that William of Ypres followed Stephen, count of Boulogne to England soon after the latter seized the throne in December 1135 and was active there in early 1136. However, there is no unambiguous evidence for this, and it can only be said that by 1137 William was in a prominent position within Stephen's following, when he led a force of Flemings as part of the army with which the king opposed Count Geoffrey of Anjou in Normandy. It is at least possible that William and his men first joined Stephen at this time. Orderic and other chroniclers say that William was anxious to give battle, but some Norman barons resented the Flemings' influence with the king, and a violent quarrel broke out which forced Stephen to abandon his campaign. Stephen did not hesitate to employ William in Normandy again, sending him to restore order there with Waleran, count of Meulan, in May 1138. However, Earl Robert of Gloucester's alliance with the Angevins made it hard for Stephen's followers to recover lost ground, and William returned to England by June 1139, but probably in 1138. Chronicles mention his involvement in some of the most crucial events of Stephen's reign, notably the arrest of the bishops in 1139 and the battle of Lincoln at which Stephen was captured in February 1141. Along with most of the king's baronial supporters William fled at Lincoln, but this may have been no more than realism, as Henry &#145;of Huntingdon&#146; suggests. It left William free to play a key role in the subsequent recovery, rallying forces in Kent with Stephen's queen, Matilda, and eventually defeating the Angevin army besieging Winchester in September 1141. The capture there of Robert of Gloucester, who was confined in Rochester Castle under William's custody, afforded the means of freeing Stephen by an exchange of prisoners which took place in November. The king then spent Christmas at Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="KingStephensofficer"></a>King Stephen's officer</h2>William's role as the leading royal agent in Kent was also crucial to his political importance. It probably began a little later than is usually supposed, in 1138&#150;9 rather than 1136. The local though later chronicler Gervase of Canterbury couples the settlement of William and his Flemish troops with the empress's invasion of England, to which it may have been a reaction. William was also well placed to maintain links with Stephen's county of Boulogne, where he witnessed a charter of Queen Matilda <i>c</i>.1142&#150;7. Flemish trade and finance must have been important to Stephen's war effort as well as Flemish mercenaries. Gervase condemned the Flemings in Kent as &#145;like wolves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 2.73) and Archbishop Theobald described William in a letter to Pope Adrian IV of 1156&#150;7 as &#145;that notorious tyrant and persecutor of our church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John of Salisbury</span>, 1.37). These were convenient glosses to put on events after the change of regime in 1154. Contemporary sources reveal a more complex picture of collaboration at local level, including William's attempt to arrange peace between Stephen and Theobald in 1148. William also founded a Cistercian house at Boxley <i>c</i>.1146 and made other grants to churches. Chroniclers describe him as having &#145;all Kent committed to his custody&#146; and &#145;possessing the county&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.121; 2.73). Though he never assumed the comital title, perhaps for fear of offending Count Thierry of Flanders, William exercised powers like those of the more active earls created by Stephen in other counties <i>c</i>.1138&#150;40.<br>
<br>Under Stephen, William witnessed about fifty-five genuine royal charters, of which none can be earlier than 1138, further evidence of when his role in English government really expanded, and none need be later than 1148. The evidence suggests that William was not in close attendance on the king, but divided his time between Kent, the royal court, and independent commissions, military or otherwise. He was not a military professional in any exclusive sense; as in Kent, his activities ranged much more widely. Nor is it clear that he was &#145;a man of violence&#146; as he has been described. Local chronicles accused him of threatening St Albans and taking money for the king from Abingdon in 1143, while William of Malmesbury singled out his burning of Wherwell nunnery in 1141. Few modern historians would regard this record as outside the normal practice of twelfth-century warfare, all the more so as Wherwell was fortified by the empress's men before it was attacked.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>After 1148 the patterns of power in England settled into a stalemate and William's role may have became more localized, or declined in importance, as the charter attestations suggest. Some later sources say that he went blind, though even if these reports are true the date and circumstances remain elusive. By the time Stephen conceded the English royal succession to Count Henry of Anjou in 1153, William's position in England was clearly under threat. His power base in Kent, though impressive, was insecure, founded on the custody of towns and royal demesne rather than land in fee. With many other Flemings he left England soon after Henry II's accession, though there is no real evidence of forced expulsions. The new king did not cancel William's revenues from Kent until Easter 1157; they amounted to &pound;440 on the pipe roll of 1156, the only surviving full year record to indicate the scale of the resources available to him during Stephen's reign. Since by 1154 William had mended his relations with Thierry of Flanders, he was able to retire to at least part of his paternal inheritance at Lo. He had the resources to give major assistance for the rebuilding of the abbey of St Bertin after a fire in 1152. His last known charter can be dated to 1162, and as the chronicle of the counts of Flanders says that he lived for about ten years after leaving England, his death can be placed in 1164 or 1165. He was buried at St Peter's Abbey in Lo, which his father had founded in 1093.<br>
