<span class="headword">Craxton,  Janet Helen Rosemary</span>  (1929&#150;1981), <span class="occ">oboist and teacher</span>, was born on 17 May 1929 at 8 Grove End Road, London, the only daughter and the youngest of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67632/', "(Thomas) Harold Hunt Craxton (1885&#150;1971)")</script> and his wife, Essie May Faulkner (1890&#150;1977). Her father was the eldest son of Thomas Robert Craxton of Devizes, Wiltshire, and senior piano professor at the Royal Academy of Music. Previously at the Matthay School, he was an outstanding pianist, accompanist, and music editor. Her mother was an intelligently modest, &#145;saintly&#146; woman. They married in 1914.<br>
<br>Few musicians have had a more fortunate background than Janet Craxton, except perhaps Mozart himself, or Craxton's Hampstead neighbour and near contemporary at the academy, the remarkable horn player Dennis Brain (1921&#150;1957). Indeed, there are many similarities in their lives and careers: each was brought up in an exceptionally musical family, with the father a notable teacher, and became an outstanding wind instrumentalist at the academy; each became a leading soloist, orchestral principal, and chamber music player, and had major works composed for him or her; and each died suddenly and was greatly missed.<br>
<br>Janet Craxton had five elder brothers, which may explain why she was something of a tomboy: she spoke in low, sonorous, oboe-like tones, and was tall and willowy. Anthony, her eldest brother (1918&#150;1999), became a senior television producer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101581/', "John Craxton (1922&#150;2009)")</script>, the artist, first visited Crete in 1947 and made his home there from 1960. She grew up at 8 Grove End Road, in north-west London; the family's post-war home was 14 Kidderpore Avenue, Hampstead. By 1930 the Craxtons had become the most talked-about and most loved family in musical London.<br>
<br>After attending Francis Holland School, Baker Street, and King Alfred's School, Hampstead, Craxton entered the Royal Academy of Music, where between 1945 and 1948 she studied the oboe with Helen Gaskell, the piano with her father, and musicianship with Priaulx Rainier; she then went to the Paris Conservatoire as a pupil of Pierre Bajeux (1948&#150;9), each Wednesday afternoon attending Nadia Boulanger's seminar in the rue Ballu. In 1958 she was appointed both oboe professor at the academy and tutor to the National Youth Orchestra. The oboe faculty at the academy was a remarkable and cohesive group with such luminaries as Leonard Brain (Dennis's brother), Neil Black, and Michael Dobson, who said: &#145;The lovely sound that she produced was a reflection of the naturalness and warmth of her own personality&#146;  (private information). Another was Evelyn Barbirolli, who remembered her as &#145;a very dear loyal friend, a great musician, inspired teacher and performer&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Craxton was principal oboist in the Hall&eacute; Orchestra (1949&#150;52), the London Mozart Players (1952&#150;4), the BBC Symphony Orchestra (1954&#150;63), the London Sinfonietta (1969&#150;81), and the orchestra of the Royal Opera House (1979&#150;81). She toured the USA with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the USSR with the English Opera Group. In 1957, while on a tour of Canada, L&eacute;on Goossens chanced to overhear a radio broadcast, not knowing which orchestra was playing. He suddenly remarked: &#145;It must be the BBC from home: only Janet can play like that&#146;  (private information). And so it was.<br>
<br>A perfectionist, Janet Craxton preferred to make her own reeds. Once, being dissatisfied with her own performance in an orchestral concert, she returned her performer's fee. She was determined: having decided to do something, she had that rare ability to make things happen. In 1967 Craxton formed the London Oboe Quartet; she was fortunate in having a personal following which ensured her a good audience, and the quartet gave many concerts and broadcasts. She also played in the London Concertante among other ensembles.<br>
<br>Janet Craxton was sought after as a soloist, and gave a number of world premi&egrave;res. These works included Ralph Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">Ten Blake Songs</span> (1958) with the tenor Wilfred Brown, and three compositions by Lennox Berkeley: the sonatina for oboe and piano, op. 61 (1962), dedicated to Janet and her brother John; the oboe quartet, op. 70 (1967); and the <span class="italic">Sinfonia concertante</span>, op. 84, with large chamber orchestra (commissioned by the BBC for the 1973 Promenade Concerts). Other commissions were from Alan Rawsthorne, Elisabeth Lutyens, Elizabeth Maconchy, Richard Stoker, and Priaulx Rainier.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1961 Janet Craxton married Alan Richardson (1904&#150;1978), composer, piano professor at the academy, and a former pupil of her father. At their summer cottage, High Latch, in the Lammermuir Hills south of Edinburgh, she pursued wide interests, including cycling, gardening, golf, and organic cooking. Craxton was an environmentalist, loved animals, and was an excellent draughtsman, but photography took first place among these activities: her camera went with her everywhere. After many happy years, she made time to nurse both parents and husband during their final illnesses.<br>
<br>Janet Craxton died suddenly and unexpectedly on 18 July 1981 at Lodge Farm Cottage, Rossway, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. It was impossible to ascertain the cause of death. She left her body to science. There was a service shortly after her death. She left funds to the Craxton memorial trust and to the Royal Academy of Music. A thanksgiving concert was given at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday 24 April 1982; the performers included Sir Peter Pears, who spoke about her, Denis Matthews, Nina Milkina, Celia Nicklin, Bernard Roberts, the London Sinfonietta, the Trio Cannello, the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, and remaining members of the London Oboe Quartet. Works by Alan Richardson and Neil Saunders were performed.<br>
<br>Craxton's pupil Valerie Taylor Lockwood has said:<blockquote>Janet hated pretentiousness and anyone in music for their own ends. She was caring and understanding of shortcomings, but had the highest musical standards so she could be quite exacting. Her sense of humour was wicked. She loved cats and children, talking to both in their own language. As an oboist Janet had a completely different tone; although Paris-trained it was a darker Germanic sound with total control. (private information, V. Taylor Lockwood)</blockquote>Asked if she had any shortcomings, Valerie Taylor Lockwood replied: &#145;No, in my opinion she was perfect. I find myself thinking of her almost every day in my teaching&#146;  (ibid.). Janet Craxton was an outstanding person in every way, dedicated, caring, intensely musical, deeply conscientious.<br>
