<span class="headword">Edgson,  (Walter) Stanley</span>  (1893&#150;1950), <span class="occ">commercial property developer</span>, was born in 1893. Nothing else is known about his life until he began his estate agency career with the practice of Rawlins and Culver, moving to the commercial chartered surveyors Hillier and Parker, based in the West End, prior to the First World War. He joined the Middlesex yeomanry as a territorial in 1912 and was commissioned to the Royal Field Artillery in June 1915, serving in France from 1915 until 1918. He was wounded on the Somme, and retired in 1918 with the rank of major. On returning to Hillier and Parker following the war he was made a partner.<br>
<br>Following its merger with the shops agency May and Rowden in 1912, the renamed Hillier, Parker, May, and Rowden grew to dominate commercial estate agency during the inter-war years. Edgson took charge of Hillier Parker's London and home counties business, becoming an eminent authority on the City and West End property markets, while Hillier Parker's other leading light, Douglas Overall, took charge of the provincial markets. During this period of rapid suburban expansion many new shopping centres were established along London's growing arterial road network. Edgson played an important part in these developments, assisting retailers in finding appropriate sites for new stores and bringing together shopping parade developers and the multiple retailers which were essential to the success of their projects.<br>
<br>Edgson was also directly involved in the commercial property market, establishing Central Commercial Properties in 1929. This specialized in London area high street shops, the section of the property market with which he was particularly well acquainted. Overall and Edgson became joint senior partners of Hillier Parker in 1937, by which time the latter had married; he and his wife, Nellie, had two sons and a daughter. His son Peter was also to become a senior partner of Hillier Parker.<br>
<br>Edward Erdman, another of the leading commercial chartered surveyors of this period, recalled Stanley Edgson as a dynamic personality and first class auctioneer, who was the main driving force behind Hillier Parker's spectacular success during the inter-war years  (Erdman, 4). As an auctioneer he was well known for his rich turn of phrase, such as &#145;the pleasure of offering from this rostrum&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>). He won the Penfold gold medal of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and was also an active member of the Chartered Auctioneers and Estate Agents Institute, serving on its council for many years, including a period as senior vice-president.<br>
<br>Edgson's non-business interests included local politics; in 1925 he became a member of Westminster city council and in 1941 he became mayor of Westminster. As vice-chairman of the council's civil defence committee he was closely involved in dealing with the effects of the blitz. In 1945 he stood, unsuccessfully, as a Conservative candidate for Balham and Tooting. He remained active in Westminster city council until his death.<br>
<br>Edgson retired in 1947 and in the following years devoted much of his energy to raising funds for a new estate management department at the University of Cambridge. He died suddenly at Sunset Lodge Hotel, Montego Bay, Jamaica, on 18 February 1950, and was survived by his wife.<br>
