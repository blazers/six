<span class="headword">Ramsey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dale; <em>other married name </em>Avery]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Ramsey  (<em>d.</em> 1601), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the eldest daughter of the Bristol merchant William Dale. Nothing is known of her early years though they may have been made difficult by her father's alienation from the Bristol civic &eacute;lite after he brought a Star Chamber suit at the end of his year as sheriff in 1518&#150;19 complaining that the income from the office was no longer sufficient to bear its charges because the mayor and aldermen were detaining the profit of the city's lands. He progressed no further in the civic <i>cursus honorum</i>. The identity of his daughter's first husband is unknown, but by 1554 she was married to Thomas Avery (<i>d</i>. 1576), a gentleman of Berden in Essex. Avery had made his career in the service of Thomas Cromwell, and later became a gentleman pensioner, and an associate of Sir Ralph Sadler, who secured him the nomination of the parliamentary representation of Liverpool in 1571, and to whom he left &#145;my table of gold with the Lord Cromwell's visage&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/58, fol. 287<i>r</i>). The marriage was childless, and Avery instructed that the manor of Colne Engaine was to pass on Mary's death to &#145;a boy&#146;, presumably a bastard, John Avery, to whom Mary herself left just &pound;20 when she died. Thomas Avery had strong London connections (he had been trained by Cromwell's commercial agent Stephen Vaughan, and one of the overseers of his will was the former lord mayor Sir Thomas Lodge) and it is possibly these that explain his widow's speedy remarriage in 1578 to Sir Thomas Ramsey (1510/11&#150;1590).<br>
<br>&#145;Rich Ramsey&#146; was a fine catch, for he was lord mayor of London in the year of their marriage. The second son of John Ramsey of Eaton Bridge near Westerham in Kent, he had been apprenticed in London, and became free of the Grocers' Company between 1537 and 1539, and in 1540 married his first wife, Alice (1492/3&#150;1578), daughter of Bevis Lea of Enfield in Staffordshire. Ramsey was elected alderman in 1566, and served for Cheap ward before translating to Cornhill ward in 1588. He served as sheriff in 1567&#150;8 and lord mayor in 1577&#150;8. He was among the most assiduous of aldermen, with an attendance record of 100 per cent in his shrieval year, and 80 per cent thereafter until his death.<br>
<br>To judge from his subsidy assessments, reaching &pound;400 in 1582, Ramsey was among the wealthiest men in Elizabethan London. Mary moved into the house &#145;with a very fair forefront&#146;  (Stow, 1.203) built by Sir Martin Bowes, which Ramsey had purchased in 1566 in Lombard Street. When the house and the two adjoining tenements were sold in 1608 they fetched &pound;1500. Mary certainly did not want for the comforts of life: by the time of her death she owned a coach, and there were bequests of numerous items of silver and jewellery, including a &#145;gold ring with a ruby &hellip; a jewel of diamonds with three pearls hanging thereon &hellip; my gold bracelets which Sir Thomas Ramsey gave me &hellip; my silver bason and ewer with mine arms thereon&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/98, fols. 190<i>v</i>&#150;193<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Mary Ramsey's interest in charity was focused by her husband's involvement with the London hospitals, for he was president of Christ's Hospital from 1582 until his death. Although their charities were to tick several of the godly boxes, they do not seem particularly to have been associated with the godly wing of the church. They supported their local clergy, including Thomas Buckminster, a noted &#145;obedient protestant&#146; and Lady Ramsey intervened in 1594 to secure a pension from Christ's Hospital for Robert Crowley's widow. It was also important that there were no children from either of Sir Thomas's marriages. The beneficiaries of his will included a number of nephews and nieces, particularly Elizabeth Holmden (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tailor) married to Edward Holmden, a Levant merchant who received a life interest in Ramsey's former house in St Mary Woolchurch, and her brothers, Thomas, William, and Giles Tailor. Thomas was to receive the house in St Mary Woolnoth after Mary's death, and William and Giles the house in St Mary Woolchurch after their sister's death. William Tailor received &pound;500 in cash, and his daughter who was married to the grocer John Wanton another &pound;200. But half the moveable goods were destined for Mary Ramsey, and although the overall size of the estate is not known, the fact that the specified cash bequests of the testator's reserved half amounted to over &pound;3500 is indicative of the minimum size of Mary's inheritance.<br>
<br>For a man of this wealth Ramsey's charitable bequests might appear somewhat token. Conventional bequests were made to the hospitals, prisons, and to the poor of his parish; eighty poor men were to receive gowns at his burial; &pound;200 was to be spent on a loan stock for four young retailers of the Grocers' Company; twenty sermons were to be preached within two years of his death in St Mary Woolnoth at a cost of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per sermon. The total was just over &pound;500. But the will gives only a partial impression, for the couple had begun building up a charitable portfolio centred on Christ's Hospital some years before his death. In 1583 they had conveyed the manor of Berden and the rectory of Clavering to Christ's, with the intention of providing &pound;10 per annum for the poor in London prisons, &pound;10 per annum for St Bartholomew's Hospital, and &pound;40 per annum to support scholarships and fellowships at Peterhouse, Cambridge; the surplus income (by the beginning of the seventeenth century &pound;168 per annum) was destined for Christ's Hospital.<br>
<br>On her husband's death in 1590 Mary Ramsey sustained the momentum of charitable endeavour. Almost immediately she conveyed the manor of Colne Engaine in Essex to Christ's to perform a variety of charitable trusts, including the support of a writing school in the hospital, a grammar school at Halstead (originally intended for Clavering) in Essex, and the support of twenty poor widows. Another trust was created in 1597 to support the poor of three London parishes. The charitable tide continued to flow strongly in her will of 1601. She left &pound;1000 to her native Bristol to be used in general charitable purposes, loan stocks of &pound;200 apiece to five city companies (the interest being used to support the poor of those companies), a stock of &pound;500 to relieve debtors, and an endowment of &pound;2000 yielding &pound;100 per annum, of which &pound;40 was destined for university exhibitions, &pound;20 for wounded soldiers, &pound;2 for sermons, and the residue for the clothing and support of the poor. The total capital value of the charities established by the Ramseys between 1583 and 1601 was &pound;14,318.<br>
<br>Mary Ramsey died in November 1601, in London, and was buried at Christ Church on the 13th. It was unfortunate that the distribution of a dole (interestingly not specified in her will) in Leadenhall at the time of her funeral resulted in a stampede in which seventeen poor people were killed. But this did not hold back the encomiasts. In 1602 Nicholas Bourne published <span class="italic">An Epitaph upon the Decease of the Worshipful Lady Ramsey</span>, &#145;sweet Ramsey&#146; as she was repeatedly called in the text. In 1606 the playwright Thomas Heywood dramatized the life of the Ramseys, or a fictionalized version of it, in part 2 of <span class="italic">If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody</span>. Lady Ramsey is here presented as the model of virtuous civic womanhood. She persuades Alexander Nowell, the dean of St Paul's, to arbitrate in a property dispute between Sir Thomas Gresham and her husband, and on their reconciliation she repeatedly celebrates Gresham's charity in founding the Royal Exchange, &#145;an honour to all English merchants&#146;. She is also present when Dean Nowell takes Gresham and the Ramseys into his picture gallery, where the portraits of virtuous citizens are displayed, moving Lady Ramsey to exclaim, &#145;Why should I not live so, that being dead/My name might have a register with theirs?&#146;. She later appears &#145;dealing of our charity &hellip; to poor soldiers such as want&#146;. The exemplary portraits also move her husband, who becomes &#145;addicted/Unto the poor's relief&#146; in his dying days. Lady Ramsey's memory was assured by the repeated celebration of her charities in the works of John Stow and their derivatives, and in the annual civic celebration of charity at the Easter Spital sermons where her pensioners marched each year in their red caps and blue coats sewn with the initials MR. Appropriately, both Ramseys were celebrated in civic portraiture; Mary's portrait survives at Christ's Hospital, her husband's was among those painted on canvas banners rolled out on red-letter days in the Grocers' Company hall in the early seventeenth century.<br>
