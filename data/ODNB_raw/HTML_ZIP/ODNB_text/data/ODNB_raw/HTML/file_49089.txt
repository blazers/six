<span class="headword">Gibbons family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1735&#150;1863), <span class="occ">ironmasters, colliery proprietors, and bankers</span> came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_62381"></a><span class="headword">John Gibbons</span>  (1703&#150;1778)<span class="occ"></span>, who was active as an ironmonger by the mid-1730s. By origin the family were yeoman farmers who steadily acquired modest amounts of land in the parish of Sedgeley in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Landownership led them into mineral exploitation, and the Gibbonses were engaged in the coal trade from at least the 1620s. Their entry into the burgeoning metalware manufacturing sector in the west midlands was at the initiative of John Gibbons. The son of William Gibbons (1673&#150;1744), farmer and coal proprietor, and his wife, Elizabeth Hawksford, Gibbons evidently flourished as a putting-out nailer, since from the 1750s he moved into primary iron processing, leasing first Pitchford forge in Shropshire, then a succession of forges in the Stour valley on the border of Staffordshire and Worcestershire.<br>
<br>John Gibbons and his wife, Grace Austin (1708&#150;1785), had three sons, who carried on their father's business after his death in 1778: <a name="cosubject_49086"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Gibbons</span>  (1730&#150;1813)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_49085"></a><span class="headword">William Gibbons</span>  (1732&#150;1807)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_49087"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Gibbons</span>  (1735&#150;1832) were ironmasters as well as ironmongers. Benjamin Gibbons was entrusted with management of the iron business around Kingswinford, which in the 1780s comprised forges at Hyde and Lye and warehouses at Stourport, Lower Gornal, and Hyde. Thomas Gibbons took charge of the merchant house at Wolverhampton which was subsequently developed as a bank; and in 1775 he married Mary Moseley (<i>d</i>. 1833). At the same time William Gibbons ran the family's merchant house at Bristol, buying pig iron for the midland forges and overseeing the export of metalwares to the American market. In 1778 William married Phyllis Watkins (1760&#150;1791).<br>
<br>The brothers took full advantage of the boom in the iron industry which followed the end of the American War of Independence. They extended their interests rapidly, taking in kinsmen as junior partners and mortgaging land to supply investment funds when circulating capital could not be spared from the ironware business. Thus, Benjamin Gibbons built a blast furnace at Bilston in 1787, taking his cousins William and Benjamin Bickley as partners; and in 1788 he joined his two brothers in leasing a furnace at the Level, as well as a forge and slitting mill at Cradley. In this way the Gibbonses emerged as major figures in the iron industry of their native region, operating seven blast furnaces with associated forge capacity by 1812. William Gibbons achieved eminence as a citizen of Bristol as well, becoming mayor of the city in 1800&#150;01. Indeed, William Gibbons also became an industrial lobbyist of national reputation. He was a spokesman for the iron trade during the debates on Britain's commercial future in the wake of the American d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, giving voice to ironmasters' anxieties concerning the &#145;Irish propositions&#146; in 1785, in which William Pitt the younger sought to establish free trade with Ireland; and he also took issue with the commercial treaty negotiated in the same year with France by William Eden. Later, he twice led campaigns to avert the taxation of pig iron during the Napoleonic wars, in 1797&#150;8 and in 1806, on each occasion with success.<br>
<br>The single partnership which had governed the family's affairs in the late eighteenth century was divided up after the death at Bristol of William Gibbons in 1807. The Bristol house was signed over to his only son, William (1782&#150;1848), who was married to Anne Every (1784&#150;1855). At the same time the midland property was divided between his surviving brothers. After the death of Thomas Gibbons in 1813 at Teignmouth his share in the midland banking and ironmaking businesses passed to his three sons: <a href="#cosubject_62382">John (1777&#150;1851) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Benjamin (1783&#150;1873) and Thomas (1787&#150;1829). The control of this new generation was consolidated a year later with the retirement of the elder Benjamin Gibbons, who made over the Level furnaces and other industrial plant to his nephews in return for an annuity, a capital sum of &pound;24,000, and the Corbyns Hall estate which the family had purchased in 1779. The separating off of Benjamin Gibbons's interests was providential, for it was to allow the family to recover from the bankruptcy which overwhelmed it in the post-war slump. The three brothers were gazetted bankrupt as bankers in March 1816, pulling the iron business down with them. Something was saved from the wreck when the eighty-year-old Benjamin Gibbons, in the guise of a preferential creditor, compelled the assignees to transfer the Level works and collieries to him. Benjamin senior lived until 1832.<br>
<br>From this foundation the family was able to rebuild its fortune. The three sons of Thomas Gibbons (1730&#150;1813) were involved in a set of interlocking partnerships, centred on the Level works but extending to Corbyns Hall, where three new furnaces were built in the mid-1820s, and to the Ketley works near Dudley. <a name="cosubject_62382"></a><span class="headword">John Gibbons</span>  (1777&#150;1851), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, proved the most technically adept of the brothers, publishing two short works on industrial practice: <span class="italic">Practical Remarks on the Construction of the Staffordshire Blast Furnace</span> (1839) and <span class="italic">Practical remarks on the use of the cinder pig in the puddling furnaces, and on the management of the forge and mill</span> (1844). He was married to Elizabeth Steen (<i>d</i>. 1889), who survived his death in 1851.<br>
<br>As a whole, the family was innovative, being one of the earliest south Staffordshire iron partnerships to adopt J. B. Neilson's patent hot-blast technology when it became widely available in the mid-1830s. However, there was little they could do to overcome the declining competitiveness of south Staffordshire as a pig iron-producing region, eclipsed as it was by Scotland and Cleveland in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The family's problems in the iron trade were for a long time compensated for by the resilience of their coal interests. The long-established Gibbons habit of buying land stood them in good stead, for it furnished them with a good deal of mineral-rich real estate in south Staffordshire. The Corbyns Hall estate proved a consistent source of wealth in this respect. Yet the family's difficulties were compounded by entrepreneurial (and demographic) failure. A new generation of ironmasters did not emerge, leaving the elder Benjamin Gibbons, a childless bachelor, to preside over a slow running down of the business. The Level works were relinquished in the mid-1840s and the Ketley furnaces were never worked after 1858. The Corbyns Hall furnaces were the last to go, being blown out in 1869.<br>
<br>The last burst of entrepreneurial dynamism in the iron trade came from the Bristol branch of the family, not the west midland. <a name="cosubject_49089"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Gibbons</span>  (1815&#150;1863), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, the youngest son of William Gibbons (1782&#150;1848), entered the iron industry via firebrick manufacture. He leased the Hallfields furnace in the Black Country in 1846 and the Tipton Green ironworks in 1847. In the mid-1850s he took over the Millfield works, only a short distance from the now derelict Bilston furnace which his family had built in 1788, but by the end of the decade he had begun a partial withdrawal from the west midland iron trade. Hallfields and Tipton Green were both given up in 1859. Millfield remained in his hands, but Benjamin Gibbons's attention was now directed to the Forest of Dean, where he had purchased the Soudley ironworks in 1856. His premature death on 3 September 1863 at Athol House, Edgbaston, Birmingham, ended any chance of a renewal of the family's involvement in the iron industry. He was survived by his wife, Emily. In the later nineteenth century the surviving branches of the family lived as <i>rentier</i> gentry.<br>
