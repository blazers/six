<span class="headword">Callendar,  Hugh Longbourne</span>  (1863&#150;1930), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 18 April 1863 at Hatherop, Gloucestershire, the eldest son of Hugh Callendar, rector of Hatherop, and his wife, Anne (Annie) Cecilia Longbourne. From Marlborough College, where he ranked top in classics and mathematics and excelled at sports, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1882, obtaining a first class in the classical tripos in his second year and graduating as sixteenth wrangler in 1885. Later that year he arrived at the Cavendish Laboratory, then under J. J. Thomson, having done no serious reading in physics and lacking practical laboratory experience. Nevertheless Thomson considered that he was capable of experimental research and the accurate measurement of electrical resistance was selected as a suitable subject. Callendar's thesis on platinum thermometry was accepted, and he was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1886.<br>
<br>The importance of Callendar's thesis led swiftly to its publication, &#145;On the practical measurements of temperature: experiments made at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1887, 161&#150;230), and determined one of the two major lines of Callendar's subsequent work, the other being on the properties of steam. He was appointed professor of physics at Royal Holloway College, Englefield Green, in 1893 but stayed there only two terms before moving to Canada to take up the chair of physics at McGill University, Montreal, where he was in charge of the new Macdonald physics building. There Callendar found suitable apparatus on which he could pursue his plans for high-precision work based on electrical measures. He also studied engineering problems connected with steam turbines, and with John Thomas Nicolson determined the temperature of steam expansion behind a piston. In collaboration with Professor Howard Turner Barnes he began the study of the calorimetric properties of water. On 17 May 1894 he married Victoria Mary, eldest daughter of Alexander Stewart of Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire. They had three sons and a daughter. In June that year he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. On leaving McGill his place was taken by Ernest Rutherford. Callendar returned to England in 1898 as Quain professor of physics at University College, London. In 1902 he succeeded Sir Arthur R&uuml;cker as professor of physics at the Royal College of Science, London, incorporated into the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1907, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Building on the work in 1861 of Ernst Werner von Siemens, Callendar developed the platinum resistance thermometer to the point where it provided a standard for the establishment of the thermometric scale. Platinum thermometers were appreciated in the laboratory where they were superior to the air thermometers in use hitherto, and they were also welcomed by engineers as convenient and practicable means of regulating heat in industrial operations. Among other inventions made in connection with his researches Callendar devised in 1887 an extremely accurate compensation bridge; the original, constructed in 1893, was used throughout his researches on steam. An important paper, &#145;Thermodynamic properties of gases and vapours deduced from a modified form of the Joule-Thomson equation&#146;  (<span class="italic">PRS</span>, 67, 1900, 266&#150;86) formed the basis of his subsequent work on steam, for in it he stated all the thermodynamic properties of steam by means of consistent thermodynamic formulae, leading to the formulation of his steam equation and the publication of his <span class="italic">Callendar Steam Tables</span> (1915, 1922, 1927), giving the properties of steam up to and beyond the critical pressure. He also published <span class="italic">The Properties of Steam</span> (1920). Callendar took part in the first International Steam Tables Conference, held in London in 1929 to co-ordinate research work in various countries. In 1899 Lord Rayleigh's committee of electrical standards accepted Callendar's proposals for a standard scale of temperature based on the platinum thermometer, and it continues to be relied on for temperatures between the boiling point of liquid oxygen (-182.97 &deg;C) and the melting point of antimony (630.5 &deg;C).<br>
<br>Among his other projects Callendar directed and carried out, sometimes with collaborators, research on the specific heat of gases, the osmotic pressure of solutions (1908), the absolute expansion of mercury (1911), and the boiling point of sulphur (1890 and 1912). For the Air Ministry he investigated dopes and detonation (1925 and 1926), and in 1926, a keen motorist himself, he published on the cause of knock in petrol engines and the effects of anti-knock additives to petrol. In a completely different field he published <span class="italic">A Manual of Cursive Shorthand</span> (1889), which came into fairly general use in some of the British colonies, and <span class="italic">A System of Phonetic Spelling Adapted to English</span> (1890).<br>
<br>Callendar received many awards and honours, among them the Watt medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1898), the Rumford medal of the Royal Society (1906), and the Hawksley gold medal of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (1915). He was president of the Physical Society of London in 1910, and their first Duddell memorial medallist in 1924. He was president of section A of the British Association in 1912 and was made CBE in 1920. Callendar's early passion for sport remained with him; when too old for tennis he enjoyed watching his wife and children play in tournaments. He was an excellent teacher and his dignified kindliness endeared him to his students. He died at 11 Grange Park, Ealing, London, on 21 January 1930. He was survived by his wife.<br>
