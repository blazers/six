<span class="headword">Oda</span> <span class="st"> [St Oda, Odo]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 958), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was the son of a Dane who arrived in England in the army that invaded in 865, led, according to one version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, by Ubbe and Ivarr. Oda's father had apparently settled in East Anglia, where his son later held lands.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlyadvancement"></a>Family background and early advancement</h2>Oda's family produced a number of prominent churchmen in this period. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20917/', "Oswald")</script> was later archbishop of York, and the latter's kinsmen, Oscytel, archbishop of York between 958 or 959 and 971, and Thurcytel, abbot of Bedford (and perhaps of Crowland), may also have been kinsmen of Oda. In his <span class="italic">Vita sancti Oswaldi</span> (written probably between 997 and 1002), Byrhtferth of Ramsey relates that, despite his father's paganism and discouragement, Oda attended church services and joined the household of a pious Anglo-Saxon aristocrat, &AElig;thelhelm, where he was educated by a &#145;religious man&#146;  (Raine, 1.404). He remained with &AElig;thelhelm and was ordained priest, accompanying him on a pilgrimage to Rome, during which Oda miraculously healed his patron's illness. Byrhtferth's statement that, on his return, Oda was appointed bishop of Wilton by &#145;the king&#146;, &AElig;thelhelm's brother, is muddled: no chronologically plausible English king is known to have had a brother of that name. Byrhtferth's account is probably to be preferred to that of the early twelfth-century <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span> of William of Malmesbury (<i>d</i>. 1142), largely followed in some manuscripts of John of Worcester's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, in which Oda fought under Edward the Elder, joined the clergy, became bishop of Wilton, and then archbishop of Canterbury at &AElig;thelstan's instigation. In reality, Oda doubtless did owe his appointment as bishop of Ramsbury (not Wilton) to King &AElig;thelstan (<i>r</i>. 924&#150;39), but it was &AElig;thelstan's brother King Edmund (<i>r</i>. 939&#150;46) who subsequently promoted him to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 941, one of a number of ecclesiastics who exerted great influence in Edmund's reign.<br>
<br>Oda first appears in contemporary sources in 928, witnessing royal charters as bishop of Ramsbury. His attestations show that he continued to attend royal councils for the next thirty years. Little is known of his career under &AElig;thelstan. Writing at the end of the tenth century, Richer of Rheims reports that Oda acted as a diplomat for the king in the negotiations with Hugh the Great, duke of the Franks, aimed at restoring &AElig;thelstan's nephew, Louis IV d'Outremer, to the West Frankish throne in 936, but this statement lacks contemporary authority. It is equally uncertain whether Oda accompanied &AElig;thelstan on the &#145;Brunanburh&#146; campaign, though Eadmer, in his life of Oda (<span class="italic">Vita sancti Odonis</span>, composed between 1093 and 1125), relates that he miraculously repaired the king's sword at that battle. In 940, in concert with Wulfstan, archbishop of York, he acted as peacemaker between Edmund and Olaf Guthfrithson at Leicester.<h2>
<a name="Participationingovernment"></a>Participation in government</h2>As archbishop under King Edmund, Oda maintained his close alliance with royal authority: in his pastoral letter to his bishops, for instance, he urged them to obey the royal will. He is probably the Archbishop Otto who is recorded in the life of Catroe escorting that saint to a channel port at King Edmund's behest. Oda's collaboration with Edmund produced a burst of legislation; curiously, indeed, all Oda's legislative activity took place in Edmund's reign. This material&#151;Edmund's first law code (<span class="roman">1 Edmund</span>), Oda's pastoral letter, and his so-called &#145;chapters&#146; or &#145;constitutions&#146;&#151;can be dated no more closely than to the period between his elevation to Canterbury in 941 and Edmund's death in May 946. Edmund's first law code was promulgated at an Easter synod held at London and deals entirely with religious matters, requiring the payment of church taxation, including the tithe, and imposing celibacy on the clergy. These interests are shared by the document christened <span class="italic">Constitutiones Odonis</span> in the seventeenth century, but perhaps more appropriately to be termed his &#145;Chapters&#146;, which makes considerable, though selective, use of the decrees of the papal legates of 786, and also draws on the <span class="italic">Collectio canonum Hibernensis</span>. It omits such eighth-century concerns as the banning of pagan ritual, consisting as much of moral exhortation as of legislation, with sections on the duties of kings, bishops, priests, and monks. It encourages almsgiving and, like 1 Edmund, forbids the violation of nuns and enforces payment of the tithe. Oda's address to his suffragans survives only in fragments recorded by William of Malmesbury in his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>. In addition to urging obedience to the king, it issues, in florid Latin, a reminder to the bishops of their pastoral responsibilities. During his archiepiscopate the East Anglian see was reorganized, with the creation of a new bishopric at North Elmham. The profession of faith of its first incumbent, Eadulf, is the only one to have survived from Oda's time (indeed, from the entire tenth century), perhaps indicating that Oda had a particular reason for recording and preserving it. His personal involvement would reflect his pastoral interests, as well as, perhaps, his family roots in the Danelaw.<br>
<br>Little can be said of Oda's activity in the reign of Eadred (<i>r</i>. 946&#150;55) except that he very probably crowned the king and, as his charter attestations show, continued to attend the royal court. He was, however, a beneficiary of Eadred's will, by which he acquired 200 mancuses of gold, and was to hold 400 pounds of silver at Christ Church for the relief of the peoples of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Berkshire in times of emergency. The accession of Eadwig (<i>r</i>. 955&#150;9) saw a palace revolution in which a number of Eadred's preferred advisers fell from favour. The earliest life of Dunstan, written <i>c</i>.1000 by an author known only as B, relates that Oda urged that Eadwig be induced to return to his coronation feast after he had left it to consort with a noblewoman and her daughter. This episode presumably reflects tensions which became apparent in 957 or 958 when Oda separated the king from his wife, &AElig;lfgifu, on grounds of consanguinity. Byrhtferth's claim that Oda rode to the king's mistress's estate, seized her, and forced her expulsion from the country is unlikely, not least since &AElig;lfgifu was certainly Eadwig's wife and not just his mistress. It is possible that in separating the king from his wife in 958 Oda was prompted by his support for the claims of Eadwig's younger brother Edgar, who, for reasons which are unclear, became king of the English north of the Thames in 957. The attestations of Eadwig's charters show a hiatus in Oda's attendance at court in 957 that may have been caused by his conflict with the king. Alternatively, given that he died in the following year, he may simply have been ill. Certainly, his absence did not prevent Eadwig from granting Oda 40 hides of land at Ely in 957.<h2>
<a name="Associationswithreform"></a>Associations with reform</h2>Oda was one of a group of monasticizing bishops, including Cenwald of Worcester and &AElig;lfheah of Winchester, whose attitudes and activities presaged widespread ecclesiastical reform in the next generation. He himself is reported by Byrhtferth to have taken the cowl at the monastery of St Beno&icirc;t-sur-Loire at Fleury, where St Benedict's relics were preserved, though it is not known at what point in his career this occurred. It was to Fleury that he sent his nephew Oswald, whose earlier education he had undertaken, to learn what was believed to be the superior monastic practice of that house. While Oda thus set Oswald on the path to becoming one of the triumvirate of leading reformers, his role in the careers of the other two, Dunstan and &AElig;thelwold, is less clear. One of Dunstan's early eleventh-century biographers, Adelard, relates that Dunstan was consecrated bishop of Worcester by Oda who inadvertently called him &#145;archbishop of Canterbury&#146;, thereby predicting the saint's future promotion. Oda's presence here, however, may simply be an assumption, or a convenient insertion, on Adelard's part.<br>
<br>One characteristic of reforming monasticism on the continent was its devotion to the cult of saints. As with &AElig;thelwold and Oswald, there is evidence for Oda's interest in saints, and especially in their relics. When the minster church at Ripon, founded in the 660s by St Wilfrid, was burnt down during Eadred's northern campaign (usually dated 948), Oda had the saint's relics seized and brought to Canterbury, along with Ripon's copy of Stephen of Ripon's life of Wilfrid. He enshrined the relics in a splendid new reliquary at Christ Church, and in honour of this translation commissioned Frithegod, a member of his <i>familia</i>, to write a verse version of the saint's life, the <span class="italic">Breviloquium vitae Wilfridi</span>. Its prose preface, which, though in Oda's name, was probably drafted by Frithegod, defends what amounted to a relic theft by accusing the Northumbrian clergy of neglecting the saint's remains. According to Eadmer, Oda also acquired for Canterbury relics of the Frankish saint Ouen, whom a later source attests was the subject of another life by Frithegod.<br>
<br>Oda's association with Fleury, evident also from an acrostic poem addressed to Dunstan by Abbo of Fleury, was not his only continental connection. He is also listed as bishop of Ramsbury in the confraternity book of the alpine monastery of St Gallen, and as archbishop of Canterbury in that of nearby Pf&auml;fers. Both entries may have been the fruits of trips to Rome, in the case of Pf&auml;fers perhaps to collect his pallium. It is possible, on the other hand, that his appearance in the St Gallen confraternity book is linked with that of Bishop Cenwald of Worcester, who visited the monastery in 929. However, journeys to the continent by English prelates were not unusual, and Oda may have been abroad at other times and on other business. For similar reasons, it is difficult to attach his sojourns at Fleury, either for his profession as a monk or afterwards, to events like the possible diplomatic trip of 936.<br>
<br>At Canterbury, Oda had Christ Church renovated, reroofing the cathedral and raising its walls by 20 feet. Although two charters, one purporting to restore many estates to the cathedral, the other granting land at Twickenham, are transparent forgeries, more reliable evidence shows that Oda was able to enlarge Canterbury's landed estate. A genuine charter of Eadred of 949 (its authority has sometimes been mistakenly challenged), which may even be in the hand of Dunstan himself, granted Reculver Minster to the cathedral. A charter fabricated in the mid-tenth century, which purported to be a seventh-century grant of land in Sussex to Wilfrid, may well be connected with the reception of that saint's cult at Canterbury; at any rate, it seems to have succeeded in gaining for the cathedral a large tract of land on the south coast. A charter recording the terms of a lease of Christ Church's lands at Ickham, Kent, to the Kentish thegn &AElig;thelweard is witnessed by the archbishop and his community, giving valuable evidence for the latter's composition at the time. The Canterbury clergy were clearly differentiated from monks by being ranked in the various clerical grades. They may also have worn better clothing and retained some private, though inalienable, property during their lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is likely that Oda encouraged members of the community to follow his example and take monastic vows.<h2>
<a name="Deathandmemorials"></a>Death and memorials</h2>Oda died on 2 June 958 and was buried in Christ Church, immediately to the south of the principal altar on the chord of the east apse, probably the first archbishop of Canterbury to be interred within the cathedral. In his life of Dunstan, Osbern (<i>d</i>. 1094) says that Oda's monument was &#145;in the shape of a pyramid&#146;  (Stubbs, 109). This can be interpreted as meaning either a triangular-sectioned stone coffin lid, echoing some Roman sarcophagi, or a tall, slender, tapering pillar, like the shaft of a stone cross. During the twelfth-century rebuildings of the cathedral, the relics of Oda and Wilfrid were temporarily put in the former resting-places of Dunstan and &AElig;lfheah, before both were installed in the corona, or &#145;chancel&#146;, of the Trinity Chapel, Oda's shrine standing on the south side. Eadmer reports that Oda had acquired the epithet &#145;the Good&#146; during his lifetime, and that it was still current in his own day; he also states that Dunstan, after he became archbishop in 959, was in the habit of genuflecting as he passed Oda's tomb. Lack of contemporary testimony for the cult suggests, however, that Dunstan failed to capitalize on Oda's reputation for holiness. The first evidence for Oda's cult appears in Byrhtferth's life of Oswald, which contains a lengthy account of Oda's life and recounts four miracles. Eadmer wrote the first free-standing life of Oda, drawing on the reports in B's life of Dunstan and Byrhtferth's life of Oswald, slightly embellishing them and adding only two new episodes about the saint's life, probably derived from Canterbury tradition. Although Byrhtferth reports the hostility to Oda of his successor &AElig;lfsige&#151;which is why, he says, the latter died in the Alps in 959 on his way to collect his pallium&#151;this may simply reflect the author's antipathy to &AElig;lfsige, who was never identified with the reformist tendency in the English church. Oda's feast day is given on 2 June in the early thirteenth-century calendar of Christ Church, Canterbury; some later calendars give 29 May or 4 July.<br>
