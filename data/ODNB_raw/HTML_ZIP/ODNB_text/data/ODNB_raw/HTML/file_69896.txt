<span class="headword">Skidmore,  Francis Alfred</span>  (1817&#150;1896), <span class="occ">art metal worker</span>, was born in Birmingham on 14 February 1817, the only child of Francis Skidmore (1780/81&#150;1860), silversmith, and his wife, Flora (1790/91&#150;1849), daughter of William Hedger. He was brought up in Coventry, where his father established a successful jewellers' shop in the 1820s. He was indentured as an apprentice, before becoming a freeman of Coventry in 1841 and entering his own maker's mark at the Birmingham assay office in 1845.<br>
<br>Skidmore's upbringing was one of hard work, self-improvement, and social ascent. It was also conspicuously Anglican, with his father serving as churchwarden and foeffee for Holy Trinity Church, Coventry, then under the direction of the charismatic high church vicar, Walter Farquhar Hook. Both this work ethic and his religious background were to prove formative for the young silversmith. His first independent projects were chalices: for Holy Trinity, Coventry, and St Giles, Exhall, in 1845. In 1851, the year in which he became a partner in his father's business, he attracted the praise of the Anglo-Catholic Ecclesiological Society for the church plate which he showed at the Great Exhibition.<br>
<br>This marked the start of a remarkable half decade during which Skidmore's life was transformed. In 1852 his expertise on medieval metalwork was acknowledged by his election to the intellectually prestigious and socially rather exclusive Oxford Architectural Society. On 12 July 1853 he married in Coventry, at Holy Trinity, Emma (1831&#150;1901), daughter of George Carloss, watch gilder. She had also been living and working in his father's premises as a silversmith's assistant and was &#145;a lady of very similar tastes to his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coventry Standard</span>, 20 Nov 1896). They had seven children, though only three sons and one daughter survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>At the same time, Skidmore first encountered the architect George Gilbert Scott, who was to become his greatest patron, and in 1854 he opened new premises in West Orchard Street, Coventry, with a new title: &#145;Skidmore and Son, Manufacturers of Church Plate and Metal Work&#146;. A year later, he was employed to design the roof for the new Oxford Museum (1855&#150;7; rebuilt 1858). Here was evidence that he had become a national name, trusted to work on one of the most high-profile projects of the age.<br>
<br>The years that followed saw Skidmore become one of the most notable craftsmen in the country. Through G. G. Scott, he was employed to work at cathedrals from Salisbury (1865&#150;71) to Chester (1868&#150;75), Lichfield (1855&#150;61), and York (1862). He was also employed at public buildings from St Pancras Station (1869&#150;72) to the Foreign Office (1861&#150;8). He was inevitably Scott's first choice to produce metalwork for the Albert Memorial (1864&#150;8). In 1862 his importance was recognized at the International Exhibition, where he was awarded a prize for &#145;progress, elegance of design and excellent workmanship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 71, 1896, 430). His choir screen, designed with Scott and intended for Hereford Cathedral, was greeted as &#145;the most noble work of modern times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, 30 Aug 1862, 246). By 1865 Skidmore was employing seventy-four men and fifty-one boys at the workshop in Alma Street, Coventry, where he had moved six years earlier, and Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Iron Company was launched as a joint-stock enterprise.<br>
<br>These achievements owed much to forces beyond Skidmore's control. He benefited from a tidal wave of church building and restoration; from the ever-increasing popularity of the Gothic revival; and from both the invention of new and the rediscovery of old techniques of metalworking. But his own dynamism and ability also carried him far. He exhibited widely, winning prizes at exhibitions in Dublin (1865), Coventry (1867), and Wolverhampton (1869). His well-publicized talks on metalwork at the Oxford Architectural Society and at London's Architectural Museum established him as an authority on the subject. Above all, he was a highly creative artist in his own right, trusted by architects like Scott, who allowed him enormous freedom, recalling that Skidmore had taken his initial designs and then &#145;&#147;kicked over the traces&#148; whenever he has had a chance&#146;  (Scott, 216).<br>
<br>The result is a body of work which is instantly recognizable. Inspired by what he described as &#145;Ancient Examples&#146;  (&#145;Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co, Book of Designs&#146;), it owes much to the medieval models that were celebrated by both the Oxford Architectural and Cambridge Ecclesiological societies. His church plate, in particular, draws on the fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century collections of colleges such as Corpus Christi, Oxford. Yet Skidmore was keen to emphasize that what he was doing was also utterly modern, &#145;a legacy of this <i>our</i> century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 13, 1855, 576). He used the latest techniques like electroforming, and argued that, had the medieval masters possessed the technology that the Victorians pioneered, they too would have embraced wrought-iron, plate glass, and gas lighting. He was consequently responsible for a slew of foliated and ornamented gas lights in churches throughout the country, as well as some &#145;impossibly slim&#146;  (O'Dwyer, 258) and exquisitely decorated columns, replete with iron foliage and leaves, for the Oxford Museum.<br>
<br>The roof at the Oxford Museum, however, failed; and Skidmore's business eventually failed too. As a former employee recalled, he was simply too punctilious. He &#145;worked for a good name, got the name, but lost money. He would break up goods of pounds and pounds in value just because they did not suit him in some trifling particular&#146;  (David Hiorns, <span class="italic">Coventry Times</span>, 18 Nov 1896). As taste turned away from the Gothic in general and Skidmore's sort of metalwork more particularly, he became just as unfashionable as he had once been modish, with Scott's own pupils coming to reject what they saw as &#145;gimcrack brasswork screens and gas-brackets with their vulgar blue paint, from the eminent firm of Skidmore&#146;  (J. J. Stevenson in <span class="italic">Transactions of the RIBA</span>, 1876&#150;7, 225). He was forced to surrender control of his company in 1872, and went with a much reduced firm to work at nearby Meriden. This too was taken over in the 1880s, leaving Skidmore&#151;by now nearly blind as the result of an accident&#151;dependent on his freeman's pension and a fund got up to support him in 1894. He died, &#145;in rather humble circumstances&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coventry Times</span>, 18 Nov 1896) at 118 Eagle Street, Coventry, on 13 November 1896 and was buried with his parents.<br>
<br>After his death, Skidmore's reputation continued to decline. The twentieth-century revulsion against Victorian design led to the destruction or removal of much of his work. Even the Hereford screen was eventually taken down, denounced by the dean for its &#145;incongruity and over-obtrusiveness&#146;  (R. P. Price, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Aug 1965). Although his obituarists claimed that he had worked in twenty-four cathedrals, over 300 churches, and more than a dozen Oxford and Cambridge chapels, he seemed destined to remain forgotten when he was not condemned.<br>
<br>In 1993, however, a campaign was started to raise funds for the restoration of the dismantled and decaying screen from Hereford Cathedral and in 1998 Skidmore's work at the Albert Memorial was restored. In 2000 a plaque in his memory was unveiled in Coventry at the site of his Alma Street workshop. A year later, in 2001, after the most expensive conservation project ever undertaken by the museum, the Hereford screen was installed at the V&amp;A. It is now seen as &#145;one of the monuments of High Victorian art and a masterpiece in the Gothic Revival style&#146;  (http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-hereford-screen/).<br>
