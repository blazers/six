<span class="headword">Walker,  Charles Vincent</span>  (1812&#150;1882), <span class="occ">technical editor and electrical engineer</span>, was born on 20 March 1812 in Marylebone, Middlesex, the son of Vincent Walker and his wife Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blake. Details of his education are unknown, although he was said to have been trained as an engineer. By 1838 he was drawn to the study of electricity, and was a founder and active member of the London Electrical Society, serving as its secretary and treasurer and editing its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> from 1841&#150;3. On its winding-up, he started the <span class="italic">Electrical Magazine</span>, of which only two volumes appeared, in 1841&#150;3. He acquired a wider reputation in 1841 by completing the second volume and editing the entire manuscript of Dionysius Lardner's <span class="italic">Manual of Electricity, Magnetism and Meteorology</span>, which formed part of Lardner's <span class="italic">Cabinet Cyclopedia</span>. Walker's own book on <span class="italic">Electrotype Manipulation</span> was published in 1841, and ran through many editions, and, like his telegraph manual, <span class="italic">Electric Telegraph Manipulation</span> (1850), was translated into French and German. He also edited and translated into English sundry other scientific works.<br>
<br>In 1845 Walker was appointed electrician to the South-Eastern Railway Company. During his lifelong tenure of this post, he was responsible for many improvements: when telegraph wires had to be laid underground, he was the first to make use of gutta-percha as an insulant; he devised an instrument to protect telegraph apparatus from damage by atmospheric electric discharge; and he improved graphite batteries. In 1866 he patented apparatus to enable train passengers to communicate with the guard, and in 1876 he patented a &#145;train describer&#146; for indicating trains on a distant dial.<br>
<br>Walker also interested himself in submarine telegraphy and on 13 October 1848 he sent the first submarine message, through a 2 mile loop of cable laid from Folkestone to a ship anchored offshore and back, the shore end being connected with the railway company's telegraph to London Bridge Station. In 1849 he collaborated with George Biddell Airy, astronomer royal, in the introduction of time signals, which were telegraphed from Greenwich observatory to stations on the South-Eastern Railway.<br>
<br>Walker was elected to the Meteorological Society in 1850, where he held various offices and served as president in 1869&#150;70. He encouraged the society to publish its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, of which he was editor from 1861 to 1864. On 7 June 1855 he was elected to the Royal Society; on 8 January 1858 to the Royal Astronomical Society; and in 1876 he was president of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians. Walker died of heart failure at his residence, 26 Upper Grosvenor Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 24 December 1882. The probate record described him as a widower, but nothing is known of his wife.<br>
