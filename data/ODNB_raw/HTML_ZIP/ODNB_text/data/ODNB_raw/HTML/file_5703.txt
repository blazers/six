<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Close,  Francis</span>  (1797&#150;1882), <span class="occ">dean of Carlisle</span>, was born at Corston, near Bath, on 11 July 1797, the youngest of four boys and five girls of the family of the agriculturist the Revd Henry Close (1753&#150;1806) and Mary Waring (1754&#150;1843). Close was educated at Midhurst grammar school (1806&#150;8) and Merchant Taylors' School (1808&#150;12). In 1813 he experienced an evangelical conversion during his four years as a private pupil of the Revd John Scott of Hull. Close entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he continued to identify himself with evangelicalism and came under the influence of Charles Simeon, whom he described as &#145;my affectionate father, my generous patron, and my wise and helpful counsellor&#146;  (manuscript at Ridley Hall, Cambridge). He graduated BA in 1820 and MA in 1824; he was awarded a Lambeth DD in 1856. In 1820 Close married Anne Diana Arden (1791&#150;1877); they had a family of five boys (one of whom died in infancy) and four girls.<br>
<br>Close was ordained deacon in 1820 and priest in 1821. He was successively curate of Church Lawford, near Rugby (1820&#150;22), Willesden and Kingsbury (1822&#150;4), and Holy Trinity Church, Cheltenham (1824&#150;6). On the sudden death of Charles Jervis, Simeon appointed Close to succeed him as perpetual curate of Cheltenham parish church. He was also chaplain to Lord Decies from 1828, and rector of Hatford, Oxfordshire (1832&#150;5). Close consolidated and expanded the work of Jervis, and as Cheltenham increased in population from 13,396 in 1821 to 35,051 in 1851 he developed the spa town into a leading evangelical centre, which Simeon described as &#145;a heaven upon earth&#146;  (W. Carus, <span class="italic">Memoir of Charles Simeon</span>, 1847, 783). Close erected four district churches each with its own infant and national schools. In 1853, with other evangelicals who objected to the outlook of the National Society, Close formed the Church of England Education Society. Educational establishments in Cheltenham were founded (like Cheltenham College in 1841) or revived (like Cheltenham grammar school) while Close was incumbent; he was actively involved in their running, considering them to be &#145;his right hand and his left hand&#146;  (A. Harper, ed., <span class="italic">The History of the Cheltenham Grammar School</span>, 1856, 43). Close was chairman of the directors of Cheltenham College, and its evangelical stance was lost only after the constitution was changed in 1862. After his death the Dean Close Memorial School (opened in 1886) continued the evangelical tradition no longer evident at Cheltenham College. Close's greatest and most lasting achievement was in the provision of teacher training. By the mid-1840s several hundred teachers had been trained in the Cheltenham schools, and in 1847 the Church of England Training School was opened. Three years later it moved into purpose-built premises which had been financed by fund-raising engagements mainly conducted by Close.<br>
<br>Close appointed evangelicals as curates, as incumbents to the district churches, and as members of staff in the educational establishments. This brought a critical response: Alfred Tennyson, who lived for a short time in Cheltenham, called Close a parish pope, and those who objected to the activities of Close and his military friends referred to &#145;the Lieutenant-General Close brigade&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cheltenham Free Press</span>, 25 Dec 1847). Yet the town became known as one of the most sober and religious places in the whole of the United Kingdom. Close had the support of at least half of the inhabitants, and his forceful preaching attracted large congregations and numerous female admirers. Many of his sermons were published (the first anonymously in 1822) and several of them were highly critical of Romanism within and outside the Church of England, most notably <span class="italic">The Restoration of Churches is the Restoration of Popery</span> (1844) and his five November sermons, <span class="italic">The Footsteps of Error</span> (1863). Close supported missions at home and overseas, was a convinced sabbatarian (particularly opposing Sunday trains), and was an outspoken critic of horse-racing and the stage.<br>
<br>After a boating accident in Switzerland in 1855 Close became slightly paralysed and, in addition, suffered from gout, but in 1856 he was appointed dean of Carlisle in succession to A. C. Tait. In Carlisle Close took on a new lease of life and extended many of his earlier concerns, apart from education. As dean he worked with bishops Henry Montagu Villiers and Samuel Waldegrave, and they made Carlisle the most protestant of the English dioceses. In the city Close regarded himself as the &#145;rector of Carlisle&#146; and as such took a lead in its affairs. He was concerned with the spiritual destitution of the poor and opened mission rooms and a temporary wooden church. He erected two city churches (St John's and St Mary's) and was involved in the erection of a third. At Cheltenham he had been known as the poor man's friend and, in Carlisle, alarm at the effects of drink among the working classes turned him into a convinced teetotaller. His concern for total abstinence earned him the sobriquet of the teetotal dean. His opposition to Anglo-Catholicism continued, and much of his energy was directed against the English Church Union. At the cathedral he dismissed the precentor, and in the city he led a movement to close an Anglo-Catholic oratory. He was an active member of the Church Association, and like his more conservative contemporaries was critical of the early Keswick Movement.<br>
<br>Close was a big man, tall with a commanding voice. He modelled his preaching and teaching on those of Simeon and constantly expressed his indebtedness to him. Close had a good sense of humour and was extremely fond of his pets. Though he was much criticized, contemporaries admired his staunch commitment to the gospel in Cheltenham and Carlisle.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1880 Close married Mary Antrim Hodgson (1806&#150;1899), daughter of John Mabanke and widow of David Hodgson. He resigned as dean in August 1881 and settled in Penzance at Morrab House, where he died of heart failure on 18 December 1882. He was buried in Carlisle cemetery and a marble effigy was erected in the cathedral in 1885.<br>
