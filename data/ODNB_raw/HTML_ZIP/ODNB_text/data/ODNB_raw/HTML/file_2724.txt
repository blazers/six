<span class="headword">Blyth, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1823&#150;1891), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born at Birmingham on 19 March 1823, the third of the four sons of William Blyth (1788&#150;1855), a wholesale merchant of Birmingham, and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1797&#150;1861), the daughter of the Revd William Wilkins of Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham, before emigrating with his parents to Adelaide in 1839. Having worked in his family's business for two years, Arthur established a successful ironmonger's business with his brother Neville. They also invested heavily in land, and became wealthy, with several directorships of major local companies. On 5 March 1850 Arthur married Jessie Ann (<i>c</i>.1827&#150;1891), the daughter of Edward Forrest of Birmingham. They had five children, two of whom died soon after birth.<br>
<br>Blyth was elected to the South Australian legislative council in 1855 for the seat of Yatala, before moving in 1857 to the house of assembly, where he represented Gumeracha. He held this seat until 1868&#151;when he travelled to England for two years on account of his wife's ill health&#151;and then again from 1870 to 1875. He represented North Adelaide from 1875 to 1877, in which year he was knighted.<br>
<br>From 1861 Blyth relinquished all direct involvement in his business interests and devoted himself entirely to politics. In an unstable political era, he held the positions of commissioner for public works, commissioner for crown lands and immigration, treasurer, and chief secretary, on numerous occasions in various ministries in the period 1857 to 1876. Blyth was first elected to the position of premier on 4 August 1864, his ministry lasting until March the next year. A &#145;convinced free trader&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), he was widely respected in political circles, and by the public, for the hard work and efficiency he demonstrated in all roles he was given. He was chosen as premier on a further two occasions&#151;November 1871 to January 1872, and then for almost two years from July 1873 to June 1875.<br>
<br>A &#145;leading Anglican layman &hellip; well known for his commitment to religious equality&#146;  (Elford, 315), Blyth was also an early proponent of the revision of marriage practices in his state. In 1856, after a local furore erupted over the acceptability of applying church laws to marriage arrangements, he proposed a bill to make &#145;the ceremony of marriage merely a civil contract&#146;  (ibid.). His political views generally were characterized as &#145;practical, liberal, and moderate&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), although his &#145;nervous temperament&#146;  (Bowes) was less well regarded, since it was thought to weaken his decisiveness and abilities as a political leader. A contemporary judgement was that he &#145;originated no measure of first-rate importance&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On his retirement from parliament, Blyth was appointed South Australian agent-general in London. He held this post from February 1877 until 1891. He died on 7 December 1891 at his home, Sunnydene, Grassington Road, Eastbourne, Sussex. His wife, Jessie, survived him by only a fortnight.<br>
