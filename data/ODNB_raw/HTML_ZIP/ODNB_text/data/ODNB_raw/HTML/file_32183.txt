</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burnand, Sir  Francis Cowley</span>  (1836&#150;1917), <span class="occ">playwright and humorist</span>, was born in Mortimer Street, London, on 29 November 1836, the only son of Francis Burnand, a London stockbroker of protestant Savoyard descent, and his first wife, Emma Cowley, who died eight days after her son's birth. Young Frank was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1854 to 1858, where he wrote plays, acted in them under the name of Tom Pierce, and founded the Cambridge Amateur Dramatic Club described in his <span class="italic">Personal Reminiscences of the A.D.C.</span> (1880). He submitted drawings to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, one or two of which were published after revision by one of the artists on its staff. Burnand began to prepare first for law and then for the Anglican ministry, but in 1858 he converted to Roman Catholicism under the influence of John Henry Newman's <span class="italic">Doctrine of Development</span>. His infuriated father cut him adrift, and after a brief career as a barrister Burnand turned to the stage. For a short time he was an amateur actor and later managed a theatre; he sold the burlesques he had written for the Cambridge Amateur Dramatic Club to a theatrical publisher. On 31 March 1860 he married an actress, Cecilia Victoria Ranoe (1841&#150;1870), daughter of James Ranoe, a clerk; the couple had five sons and two daughters. In 1874 he married her sister Rosina (also an actress), the widow of Paysan Jones, in a ceremony on the continent, such marriages being illegal in England at that time. They had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Burnand became a comic journalist. He edited <span class="italic">The Glow-Worm</span>, a transient periodical, joined the staff of <span class="italic">Fun</span>, and, when its proprietor rejected his 1863 proposal for &#145;Mokeanna&#146;, a parodistic serial, he took it to the more receptive <span class="italic">Punch</span>. With its success, he severed his connection with <span class="italic">Fun</span> and became in due course a staff writer for <span class="italic">Punch</span> and in 1880 its editor. His predecessor, Tom Taylor, had allowed the paper to become heavy, but Burnand's rackety leadership brightened it. His own series, &#145;Happy Thoughts&#146;, begun in 1866, gave a catchword to the language and initiated a new style of narrative in which the speaker is perpetually the comic victim of some minor crisis or small disaster. His greatest editorial coup along these lines, however, was his publication of <span class="italic">The Diary of a Nobody</span> (1888) by George and Weedon Grossmith, still in print more than a hundred years later. Burnand, who declared himself hostile to no man's religion, banned <span class="italic">Punch's</span> earlier sharp attacks on Catholicism, though he proved unable to remove antisemitic jokes. His own style became increasingly prolix and anecdotal, devoted to more and more far-fetched, sometimes almost unintelligible, puns.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Burnand was concurrently pursuing the profession of comic playwright, occasionally collaborating with Montagu Williams in the 1860s. In 1865 he and a theatre musician, Frank Musgrave, produced the first attempt at English <i>opera buffe</i>: <span class="italic">Windsor Castle</span>. For the most part, however, his dramatic output consisted of burlesques, extravaganzas, and farces, with some librettos, comedies, and a few serious plays. Characteristic titles included <span class="italic">Helen, or, Taken from the Greek</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">Fowl Play, or, A Story of Chicken Hazard</span> (1868). Word play rioted in his dramatis personae and texts; for example, Whiskitoddikos appears as a high priest in <span class="italic">Ixion Rewheel'd</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">The Rise and Fall of Richard III, or, A New Front to an Old Dicky</span> (1868) contains the lines:<blockquote>
<div>I can look back on several ginny-rations,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; my ancestors, they never fought<br>
</div>
<div>With greater spirit than at A-gin-court.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Burnand's real superiority, however, lay in his invention of absurdly funny &#145;stage business&#146;. Unfortunately he had little sense of form, his dramatic structures being loosely supplied by the works he parodied or adapted. For example, his best burlesques, <span class="italic">The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">Dora and Diplunacy</span> (1878) were based on very popular serious plays. Egotistically he asserted that he merely imitated Shakespeare in appropriating sources. His best comedy, <span class="italic">The Colonel</span> (1881), was a farcical adaptation of Morris Barnett's <span class="italic">The Serious Family</span>, itself taken from <span class="italic">Le mari &agrave; la campagne</span>, both satirizing religious mania. He turned the subject to the aesthetic movement, which <span class="italic">Punch</span> was then heavily attacking, and pitted a fake professor of &#145;aesthetics&#146; against a practical American colonel. The play ran for 550 performances, continued in the provinces for years, and was performed privately before Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>As a librettist Burnand had one lasting success in <span class="italic">Cox and Box</span>, with music by Arthur Sullivan, first given by amateurs (1866, 1867) and then professionally at the Gallery of Illustration, London (1869). Still performed in the twentieth century, this musical triumveretta was based on John Maddison Morton's farce <span class="italic">Box and Cox</span> (1847). In 1867 Burnand and Sullivan also collaborated on the moderately successful <span class="italic">The Contrabandista</span> and in 1870 on <span class="italic">The Miller and his Men</span>, a Christmas extravaganza for amateurs. These early works convinced Burnand that he, not W. S. Gilbert, should have been Sullivan's librettist. His jealousy led to antagonistic reviews of Gilbert in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, but when at last Burnand revised <span class="italic">The Contrabandista</span> for Sullivan to set as <span class="italic">The Chieftain</span> in 1894, it ran for only ninety-seven performances despite first-night enthusiasm and <span class="italic">Punch's</span> adulatory review. His last libretto, <span class="italic">His Majesty</span> (1897), a collaboration, with music by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, was a failure. His work on <span class="italic">Punch</span>, rather than his dramatic output, earned him a knighthood in 1902. By that time he had lost interest in practical editorship and left it to a deputy. An attempt had been made to replace him as early as 1891, but he was not forced into unwilling retirement until 1906. After a winter of bronchitis he died unexpectedly at his home, 18 Royal Crescent, Ramsgate, Kent, on 21 April 1917, and on 25 April he was buried in the cemetery attached to St Augustine's Abbey church there. He was survived by his second wife, who died in 1924.<br>
