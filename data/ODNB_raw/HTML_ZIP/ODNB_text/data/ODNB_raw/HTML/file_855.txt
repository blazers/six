<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Stephen</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1586&#150;1619), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, whose early life is not documented, was a native of London. After serving an apprenticeship to Francis Tiver, a refiner of gold and silver, he was admitted a finer in the Tower of London mint about 1586. After a year spent working at the mint he took employment as finer with Sir Bevis Bulmer, a mining engineer at Chewton minery in the Mendip hills in Somerset. He was to remain a constant companion to Bulmer during the next twenty-six years, which he described as his &#145;Golden time&#146;, and it was from Bulmer that he learned his mining skills.<br>
<br>In 1587 Atkinson and Bulmer began working the rich silver and lead mines at Combe Martin in Devon, where they also refined silver from lead sent over from Waterford in Ireland. Atkinson accompanied Bulmer on two trips to search for alluvial gold in Lanarkshire, first from 1593 to 1596 and from 1603 to 1605. From 1608 to 1610 he and Bulmer were at the Hilderstone mine near Linlithgow, and in 1611 they travelled to Tipperary to work at a mine near Kilmore. Here Bulmer's finances gave out and after borrowing &pound;340 from Atkinson he returned to England and died leaving Atkinson &#145;much in debt for him&#146;  (Atkinson, 40).<br>
<br>By a grant of the privy council for Scotland in June 1616, and confirmed by James I, Atkinson obtained leave to search for gold and silver in Crawford Moor, on paying the king one tenth of the metals found. He sent a sample of metal to his cousin in London, who gave it to John Murray, one of the king's bedchamber attendants, to show to the king. Unfortunately Murray refused to give it back to Atkinson on his return from Scotland and consequently he had no proof to show to the various London merchants whom he was hoping would provide financial backing for his venture. The view taken by such backers was that it was an enterprise &#145;more fitting for princes than subjects&#146;  (Atkinson, 33).<br>
<br>After his failure to get commercial backing for his mining ventures, Atkinson wrote in 1619 <span class="italic">The Discoverie and Historie of the Gold Mynes in Scotland</span>. This was published by the Bannatyne Club in 1825, from a copy in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. The purpose of the book was to flatter the king by comparing him to various biblical luminaries, in order to persuade him to provide backing for the search for gold in Scotland. He argued that &#145;the opening of the secrets of the earth&#151;the gold mines of Scotland&#146; would make &#145;his majesty the richest monarch in Europe, yea in all the world&#146;  (Atkinson, iii). Atkinson failed to make any impression on the king, who had already expended &pound;3000 on the goldmines in Scotland and obtained not quite 3 ounces of gold. However, the book does provide an insight into the activities of his master, Sir Bevis Bulmer, and as such it is of great historical value. After this date Atkinson disappears, perhaps the clue being in his book, where he remarks, &#145;And because merchants are not willing to adventure to Scotland, I am therefore resolved to adventure my life and skill to Guiana&#146;  (ibid., 60).<br>
