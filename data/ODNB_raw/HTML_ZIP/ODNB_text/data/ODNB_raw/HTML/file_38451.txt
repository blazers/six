<span class="headword">Connelly <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Peacock]</span>,  Cornelia Augusta</span>  (1809&#150;1879), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun and educational reformer</span>, was born on 15 January 1809 at 1 Filbert Street, Philadelphia, USA, the youngest of the six surviving children of Ralph Peacock (<i>c</i>.1767&#150;1818), a merchant and land speculator who had emigrated from Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary (1768&#150;1823), the daughter of Jacob Swope, a German doctor, and widow of John Bowen, an English sugar planter in Jamaica. Cornelia had three brothers, two sisters, and a half-brother and half-sister. An orphan at fourteen, she was adopted by her childless half-sister, Isabella, who had married into the wealthy Episcopalian Montgomery family. Cornelia was brought up a Presbyterian but was baptized in the Episcopalian church in 1831. Well educated in Philadelphian upper-middle-class tradition, she had become, in one bishop's words, &#145;a woman of great intellectual powers&#146;  (McCarthy, 28). On 1 December 1831 she married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38452/', "Revd Pierce Connelly (1804&#150;1883)")</script>, a recently ordained Episcopalian minister. They moved immediately to Pierce's new parish in Natchez, Mississippi. Their five children were born between 1832 and 1840.<br>
<br>In December 1833, at Pierce's prompting, the Connellys began a serious exploration of Catholicism. Pierce resigned his parish in August 1835, sold their house, and moved with his family to Rome for further study, Cornelia having been received into the Catholic church at New Orleans prior to embarkation. She believed her husband would also become a Catholic and then live out his life as a layman. In Rome, however, he petitioned not only to be received but also to be considered for ordination. Canon law allowed this if both partners willingly agreed to live separate and chaste lives. Pierce was received in 1836 but, with him no nearer ordination after a year's stay during which Cornelia met the pope and many leading English Catholics, they returned to Natchez in 1838, having lost much of their investment during a financial recession. They resettled less comfortably off in Grand Coteau, Louisiana. Here their fourth child died in infancy and their third of multiple burns aged two and a half.<br>
<br>This time of suffering was the turning point in Cornelia's long and gradual transition from minister's wife and mother living on the plantation frontier of Mississippi to Catholic nun and founder of a Roman Catholic religious congregation in England. As a paid music teacher at the Sacred Heart Convent, she now experienced her first sustained exposure to the life of religious sisters and Catholic education. She and Pierce took a mutual private vow of celibacy in October 1840 after his final decision to seek ordination, and her diary for September 1841 records her decision to pursue her vocation as a nun. Their vow was made canonically binding on 1 April 1844, when they signed a deed of perpetual separation before Vatican witnesses in Rome. A period of living with the Sacred Heart nuns in Rome led her to conclude by February 1845 that she had no call to enter their society. Encouraged by the prominent Catholic layman Lord Shrewsbury, Nicholas Wiseman, Cardinal Fransoni, and, finally, Pope Gregory XVI, she agreed to found a new religious congregation in England rather than America. Cardinal Wiseman, archbishop of Westminster, saw her as the right woman to establish an educational congregation suitable for middle-class English converts wanting to become nuns. After three months in Paris living with the Sisters of the Assumption she moved to England in August 1846. Pierce, who had been ordained in July, was already there as assistant chaplain to Lord Shrewsbury. Up to this point the two younger children had lived with Cornelia, but as she began her noviciate they were sent to boarding-schools.<br>
<br>In October, Cornelia and three other women opened the first convent of the Holy Child Jesus in Derby, where they taught in poor schools. On 21 December 1847 she made her vows and was installed by Wiseman as the superior-general of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, the first new native congregation of women to be founded in England since the Reformation. Its work was educational, ranging from poor schools and industrial schools for young working women to day and boarding-schools for the middle classes, and, from 1856 to 1864, teacher training. Her educational ideas and the pedagogy of her schools and college were expressed in the <span class="italic">Book of the Order of Studies in the Schools of the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus</span> (1863). The society's mother house was moved to St Leonards in Sussex, from which new houses and schools were opened in London, Liverpool, Preston, and Blackpool during the 1850s. Their first American house was founded in Pennsylvania in 1862 and that in France in 1869. In 1863 Connelly was given the ruins of the Old Palace at Mayfield, Sussex, the former synod hall of the archbishops of Canterbury, by the duchess of Leeds. In its day the largest remaining medieval hall in England, its restoration was a point of pride among English Catholics. On completion in 1873 it became the noviciate and later the mother house. Mother Connelly was recognized by many as a courageous woman and outstanding educator. Her determination to act firmly and to listen to her conscience, even when it did not accord with the advice of clergy, did not always win her friends. Her position was also adversely affected by external criticisms and the publicity which stemmed from a course of action taken by Pierce Connelly. Unable to accept the reality of matrimonial separation, he initially sought a key role in the society and then, turning against the Catholic church, used it in a public anti-Catholic campaign. From 1848 onwards he used the children in an attempt to control Cornelia, exercising his legal right to refuse her access and removing them from the country. He followed this with an unsuccessful court action for the restitution of conjugal rights, 1848&#150;58. The many forms of suffering which Cornelia experienced, as well as her vigour and fortitude, showed in the constitutions which she drew up for her society. These were never approved by Rome in her lifetime. She died at the convent at Mayfield on 18 April 1879 of chronic nephritis and was buried in the chapel there. After her death her rule was approved and her reputation re-examined. In 1992 she received the title Venerable, the first step towards canonization.<br>
