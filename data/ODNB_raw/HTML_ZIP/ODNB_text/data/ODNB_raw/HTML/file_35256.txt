<span class="headword">Northcote,  Henry Stafford</span>, Baron Northcote  (1846&#150;1911), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, born on 18 November 1846 at 13 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20328/', "Stafford Henry Northcote, first earl of Iddesleigh (1818&#150;1887)")</script>; his mother was Cecilia Frances (1823&#150;1910), daughter of Thomas Farrer and sister of Thomas Farrer, first Lord Farrer. He went to Eton College in 1858 and to Merton College, Oxford, in 1865, graduating BA in 1869 and proceeding MA in 1873. After leaving Oxford he was appointed to a clerkship in the Foreign Office on 18 March 1868.<br>
<br>In February 1871 Northcote was attached to the joint high commission, of which his father was one of the members and which sat at Washington from February to May 1871, to consider the &#145;<i>Alabama</i> claims&#146; and other outstanding questions between Great Britain and the United States. He became secretary to the British member of the claims commission consequent on the treaty of Washington of May 1871, and assistant to the British claims agent in the general business of the commission. The commission sat at Washington from September 1871 to September 1873. In November 1876 Northcote became an acting third secretary in the diplomatic service. When Lord Salisbury went as British plenipotentiary to the Constantinople conference at the end of 1876, Northcote accompanied him as private secretary. In February 1877 he was made assistant private secretary to his father, who was then chancellor of the exchequer, and he was private secretary from October 1877 to 15 March 1880. In 1880 he retired from the diplomatic service and was elected tory MP for Exeter, his family's city. He held the seat until 1899.<br>
<br>From June 1885 to February 1886, during Lord Salisbury's short first government, Northcote was financial secretary to the War Office. In Lord Salisbury's second government he held the post of surveyor-general of the ordnance from August 1886 to December 1887, when he resigned his appointment in order to facilitate changes at the War Office. He had been created CB in 1880, and on 23 November 1887, after his father's death, he was made a baronet. He was a charity commissioner in 1891&#150;2, and in 1898 was appointed a royal commissioner for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. He was also for a time chairman of the associated chambers of commerce, and became well known and much trusted in business circles. In 1899 he was appointed to be governor of Bombay, and in January 1900 he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Northcote of Exeter, next month being made GCIE.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1900 Lord Northcote landed at Bombay, where he served as governor for three and a half years. His tenure of office was marked by &#145;a famine of unprecedented severity, incessant plague, an empty exchequer, and bad business years generally&#146;  (<span class="italic">Times of India</span>, 5 Sept 1903). Famine did not completely disappear until 1902&#150;3, and plague was still rife when Northcote left India. He began an energetic programme of reform, and especially land reform, and his <span class="roman">Bombay Land Revenue Code Amendment Act</span> (intended to protect small cultivators from moneylenders by wiping out arrears) proved highly controversial. He took other steps in the direction of land revenue reform, doing much to bring the somewhat rigid traditional policy of the Bombay government into harmony with the views of the government of India. In municipal matters, too, he made improvements, although the most important municipal act passed in his time&#151;the <span class="roman">District Municipalities Act</span>, by which local self-government in the <i>mofussil</i>, the rural hinterland, was much enlarged&#151;was a legacy from his predecessor Lord Sandhurst. Northcote travelled widely through the Bombay presidency, and he also visited Aden. He was a strong supporter of schools and hospitals, but his efforts were hampered by the impoverished state of the public finances. &#145;So far as he was able, Lord Northcote drew on his privy purse for money which the state should have furnished, and especially in the administration of relief and in the assistance of charitable undertakings was he able to take a more personally active part than any of his predecessors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bombay Gazette Budget</span>, 29 Aug 1903). He was present in 1903 at the coronation durbar which celebrated the accession of King Edward VII. When he left India on 5 September 1903 the viceroy, Lord Curzon, expressed the general feeling in the message &#145;Bombay and India are losing one of the most sympathetic and sagacious governors that they have known&#146;.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1903 Northcote had been appointed governor-general of the commonwealth of Australia. On 21 January 1904, when he was made a GCMG, he was sworn in at Sydney, and he remained in Australia for nearly four years and eight months. Northcote's task in Australia was no easy one. The commonwealth had come into existence on 1 January 1901, and Northcote had had two predecessors (lords Hopetoun and Tennyson) in three years. He was thus the first to hold his office for an appreciable length of time, and it fell largely to him to establish the position of governor-general, and to create traditions. He worked well with Alfred Deakin, and much better than he expected with the Labor leader J. C. Watson.<br>
<br>In Australia, as in India, he travelled widely. He was determined, as the head of a self-governing commonwealth, to identify himself with the inhabitants of every part of Australia. During his term of office he travelled through the greater part of every state; visited most county towns, every mining centre, and the great pastoral and agricultural districts; and succeeded in obtaining a grasp of the industrial work and life of the people. He travelled an average of over 10,000 miles a year by land and sea. Particularly important was his tour of the Northern Territory, which called public attention to this little-known and somewhat neglected part of the continent. In Sydney and Melbourne he visited every factory of importance, while in social life, and through his support for institutions and movements for the public good, he won respect and affection. He laid stress on the importance of defence and of encouraging immigration for the development of the land. He was a vigorous governor-general, delaying royal assent to the <span class="roman">Arbitration Act</span> in 1904 and controversially supervising federal and state honours  (<span class="italic">AusDB</span>). His personal wealth enabled him to entertain generously and his popularity was enhanced by his amiable and clever wife, Alice, the adopted daughter of George, Baron Mount Stephen, whom he had married on 2 October 1873.<br>
<br>Northcote returned from Australia in 1908. In 1909 he was sworn of the privy council and at the coronation of King George V he carried the banner of Australia. He was a strong defender of the privileges of the Lords in 1911. He died childless at Eastwell Park, Ashford, Kent, on 29 September 1911, and was buried at Upton Pynes, near Exeter. His wife died in London on 1 June 1934.<br>
