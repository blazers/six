<span class="headword">Bamford <span class="st"> [Balmford]</span>,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Edmund, King and Martyr, Lombard Street, London, a first cousin of Lambert Osbaldeston (1594&#150;1659). Since he mentions in his will that he was &#145;for divers yeares bredd upp&#146; in the parish of St Olave, Southwark, he may have been the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1245/', "James Balmford (b. c.1556, d. after 1623)")</script>, vicar there in 1603. He was admitted a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 24 April 1612, and was subsequently elected a scholar. He graduated BA early in 1616 and proceeded MA in 1619.<br>
<br>Like other godly preachers Bamford benefited from the patronage of Mary, Lady Vere. By the later 1620s he was chaplain to Lady Vere and her husband Sir Horace at their residence in The Hague, and through their influence was elected minister of the English congregation which met within the Church of the Sacrament Gasthuis in the Noordeinde; he was installed on 24 February 1630. The same year he married Dorothy Bennet. For the next two decades he pursued a vigorous ministry, taking an increasingly defiant line against those who, in shifting contexts, sought conformity to the prayer book. At first he associated with congregationalists like John Forbes, John Davenport, and Thomas Hooker (whom he had encountered at Emmanuel College), but he had parted company with them by 1632, when Hooker's supporters campaigned against Bamford's becoming assistant minister (and, they feared, over-quiescent partner) to the more moderate John Paget at the English church in Amsterdam. As it was, suspecting a plot by the episcopal establishment to oust him and undo his work at The Hague, Bamford declined that call, and remained to face the hostility of the new English ambassador, William (soon to be Sir William) Boswell. Bamford, complained Boswell, tended to &#145;mangle, pare and purge&#146; the liturgy &#145;most pittifully&#146;  (Sprunger, 330). To the ambassador's fury, in 1634 the minister sought, and gained, the protection of the Dutch Reformed church in the shape of the classis of The Hague; this allowed him to fight successfully any &#145;innovation&#146; emanating from England.<br>
<br>The following year, while on a visit to England to see his elderly mother and the newly widowed Lady Vere, Bamford was arrested, detained for several weeks, and brought before the court of high commission. Here he pleaded his obligation, as a subject of the Dutch government and recipient of pay from it, to abide by the regulation of the classis. He then skipped bail and returned to the Netherlands. Thanks to the continued support of the Hague classis, subsequent attempts to dislodge him from his church made by Archbishop William Laud, Boswell, and Elizabeth of Bohemia's chaplain, Sampson Johnson, failed. Perhaps the lingering respect of Elizabeth herself, an occasional member of his congregation, also helped: in his will Bamford bequeathed a &#145;faire silver and gilt cupp which the Queene of Bohemia was pleased to bestowe upon me&#146;.<br>
<br>The fall of Laud brought no relief for Bamford, however. As his congregation swelled with English exiles his attempts to adopt the liturgical practices of the Westminster assembly met resistance. In 1645 Bamford suspended the lord's supper and once again appealed to the local classis, but Boswell, still present as a royalist agent, took a leaf out of Bamford's book and invoked the support of the states general and the states of Holland against innovation. Boswell's appeal was ultimately unsuccessful, but although the authorities pronounced themselves satisfied with the regulation of the English church Bamford's position remained uncomfortable. In April 1650 he obtained leave to visit England, where he soon accepted an invitation to minister in the relatively poor London parish of St Alban, Wood Street, which had been a stronghold of presbyterianism in the 1640s. By this time a widower, he married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4257/', "Nicholas Byfield (1578/9&#150;1622)")</script> and sister of Adoniram Byfield (<i>d</i>. 1658&times;60), whose family had longstanding links to the Veres. By November 1650 the church in The Hague received confirmation that he would not return.<br>
<br>In London Bamford gained a reputation among the godly for orthodoxy, humility, studiousness, and good teaching, and worked on &#145;many excellent pieces intended for the presse&#146;  (Balmford, A3). When he drew up his will on 17 March 1655 he had a library of Latin and English books, and his own &#145;narrative papers of English and forreine Eclesiasticall and Civill affaires&#146;. He was able to leave his only child, Elizabeth, not yet eighteen years old, a portion of &pound;400. He died in 1657; his will was proved on 1 September by his widow and executor. Two years later &#145;Balmford's&#146; only publication, <span class="italic">Habakkuk's Prayer Applyed to the Churches</span> (1659), two sermons preached before the provincial assembly of London, was printed for his brother-in-law Adoniram. Accompanied by testimonials to Bamford's character and talents from Thomas Parsons and Edmund Calamy, these mourn the current state of the divided church and exhort ministers not to falter in the quest for revival.<br>
