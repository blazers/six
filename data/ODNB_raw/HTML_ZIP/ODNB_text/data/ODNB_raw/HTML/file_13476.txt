<span class="headword">Hoghton,  Daniel</span>  (1770&#150;1811), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Hedingham Castle, Essex, on 27 August 1770, the second son of Sir Henry Hoghton, sixth baronet (1728&#150;1795), of Hoghton Tower, near Blackburn and Walton Hall, near Preston, Lancashire, MP for Preston, and his second wife, Fanny (<i>d</i>. April 1803), eldest daughter of Daniel Booth, of Hutton Hall, Essex, a director of the Bank of England. A captain in the 82nd (Prince of Wales Volunteers) in 1793, Hoghton was commissioned major in the 97th (Strathspey Highlanders) on its formation on 9 February 1794. After serving as marines in the Channel Fleet, the regiment was disbanded in 1795, and Hoghton was transferred to the 67th foot on 12 August 1795. The 67th went to San Domingo in 1796, and to Jamaica in 1798. On 31 January 1799 Hoghton was transferred to the 88th foot (Connaught Rangers), and joined them in India, where he accompanied Sir John Malcolm on a journey to Bombay. The regiment served in the expedition to Egypt in 1801, but Hoghton seems to have remained in India, and to have been sent home with dispatches from Lord Wellesley in the spring of 1804.<br>
<br>Hoghton had become lieutenant-colonel in the army on 3 May 1796, and on 22 November 1804 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the newly raised 2nd battalion of the 8th foot. On 1 January 1805 he was promoted colonel. He was stationed for a time at Cork, and took part in the siege of Copenhagen in 1807 and the conquest of Martinique in 1809. In April 1810 he was appointed to the staff of the British force at Cadiz as brigadier. He was promoted major-general on 25 July, and in September he left Cadiz to join Wellington's army in Portugal. He was given the command of the 3rd brigade of the 2nd division under Sir William Stewart, with whom he had served at Cadiz, and who had been his lieutenant-colonel in the 67th.<br>
<br>In the battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, when the Spaniards gave way on the right, Stewart's division was hurried up to take their place. Its leading brigade (Colborne's) was nearly destroyed by a flank attack of cavalry, and Hoghton's brigade was deployed and moved up to the crest of the hill, which had become the key of the position. There it stood for some time against the 11,000 strong French 5th corps, its three regiments (29th, 57th, and 1st battalion 48th) losing three quarters of their men. Hoghton himself was killed by gunshot as he led forward the 29th. He was buried in the fort at Elvas on 17 May. Wellington wrote to Lord Wellesley: &#145;I understand that it was impossible for anybody to behave better than he did &hellip; he actually fell waving his hat and cheering his brigade on to the charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplementary Despatches</span>, 7.134). A public monument, voted by parliament, was placed in the north transept of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
