<span class="headword">Churchill,  John Malcolm Thorpe Fleming <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1996), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 16 September 1906 in Ceylon, the son of Alec Churchill, director of public works in Hong Kong and Ceylon, and his wife, Elinor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell). He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford; King William's College, Isle of Man; and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst; and was commissioned into the Manchester regiment in 1926. He was posted to the 2nd battalion, which he joined in Rangoon, and from the beginning of his service showed the unorthodox enterprise and daring which would characterize his subsequent career both in and after the army. Returning from a signals course at Poona, he rode a Zenith motorcycle 1500 miles across India (at one point crashing into a water buffalo, one of the most dangerous and unpredictable of wild animals), and took the Zenith over a railway bridge by pushing it along the line while himself stepping on the sleepers which had nothing between them. When the regiment moved to Maymyo he took part in &#145;flag marches&#146;, moving up and down the Irrawaddy by boat, and visiting villages to deter any of the people who might be contemplating robbery, murder, or dacoity. When not thus engaged he learned to play the bagpipes, tutored by the pipe major of the Cameron Highlanders, and became extremely proficient. However, when the regiment returned to England in 1936 he soon became bored with life at the depot, retired from the army, and set off with a friend on a grand tour of Europe. To finance this venture he played the bagpipes as an entertainer and took minor parts as an archer in films, for he was already an expert with the bow and arrow. He represented Great Britain at archery in the 1939 world championships.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Churchill was recalled by the army, and went with his regiment to France, where he used his bow and arrows (silent, accurate to 200 yards, and lethal) when on patrols in front of the German lines. In the general retreat in 1940 he was awarded an MC at the battle of L'Epinette (near B&eacute;thune), where his company was trapped by German forces. He fought back with two machine-guns (and his bow) until ammunition was exhausted and then extricated the remains of the company through the German lines at night. Later he was wounded and carried a bullet in his shoulder all his life. After returning to England he married, on 8 March 1941, Rosamund Margaret Denny (<i>b</i>. 1917), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32786/', "Sir Maurice Edward Denny, second baronet")</script>, shipbuilder, and his wife, Marjorie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lysaght). They had two sons, Malcolm John Leslie (<i>b</i>. 1942) and Rodney Alistair Gladstone (<i>b</i>. 1947).<br>
<br>In December 1941, Churchill (who had joined the commandos) was chosen to command the mixed force that raided Vaagso, in Norway, and destroyed shipping, fish-oil factories, and other enemy resources. Armed with a broad-bladed claymore and carrying his bow and arrows, he led his force ashore, playing his bagpipes. He was wounded in this action but recovered to lead (with his bagpipes) no. 2 commando in the landings at Messina in Sicily, and then at Salerno in Italy. At Salerno his commandos captured the important village of Pigoletti with its entire garrison. He was recommended for a VC but eventually was appointed DSO.<br>
<br>Churchill's next assignment was to command a mixed commando force in the attack on Brac in the Adriatic. Led by him, the commandos captured Vidova Gora, a 2500 foot high mountain with heavily mined approaches, in a night attack, but he was wounded in the subsequent fighting and was taken prisoner by the Germans. Because of his name the Germans assumed (wrongly) that he must be a relation of the prime minister, and imprisoned him with various VIPs at Sachsenhausen (near Berlin) but, because of his military reputation, they also chained him to the floor for the first month. Later he tunnelled out of the camp with another officer, but he was recaptured and transferred to a camp in Austria. He escaped from this one night when the floodlights failed, walked across the Alps, and made contact with American forces in the Po valley.<br>
<br>After the war Churchill became a parachutist, making his first jump at the age of forty, commanded a Scottish parachute battalion, and then transferred to the Seaforth Highlanders. In 1948 he was appointed second-in-command of the Highland light infantry, at that time on anti-terrorist duties in Palestine, after which he was second-in-command at the army apprentices school at Chepstow; he was then for two years chief instructor at the land/air warfare school in Australia, and then on the War Office selection board for officers. During this latter appointment he rode a surfboard a mile and a half up river on the Severn bore. His last post was as commandant (the first) of the outward bound school.<br>
<br>After retiring from the army Churchill bought eleven steamboats, which he refurbished to make journeys from Richmond to Oxford. He also took part in motorcycle speed trials and made radio-controlled model boats, which he sold at a profit. Although he was nicknamed Mad Jack on account of his bravery and flamboyance, those whom Churchill commanded were well aware that his more colourful actions, such as dashing up landing beaches brandishing a dirk and dressed only in a kilt, were designed to intimidate the enemy. He was appointed DSO twice in addition to his MC, and was also mentioned in dispatches. When not in action he was quiet and unassuming, romantic and sensitive, an avid reader of history and poetry, knowledgeable about castles and trees, and compassionate to animals, even to hostile insects. He died of bronchopneumonia at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, on 8 March 1996.<br>
