<span class="headword">Barker,  Cicely Mary</span>  (1895&#150;1973), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on 28 June 1895 at West Croydon, Surrey, the daughter of Walter Barker (1866&#150;1912), a seed merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oswald (1869&#150;1960). Barker suffered from epilepsy and was a frail child, spending much of her youth housebound. She showed an early talent for drawing, encouraged by her father's talent for wood-carving, and, in 1908, enrolled in the Croydon Art Society. Her father's death dealt a financial blow to the family. Her only sibling, Dorothy Oswald Barker (1893&#150;1954), opened a kindergarten in the Barker home, while Barker turned to drawing pictures, often using the kindergarten children as her models. From the 1920s she attended evening classes at Croydon Art School as both student and teacher. She was a devotee of the Pre-Raphaelites, particularly Edward Burne-Jones, and her work owes a debt to Beatrix Potter and Kate Greenaway.<br>
<br>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's publication of <span class="italic">The Coming of Fairies</span> (1922) fed a public interest in fairies and Barker's interest in children and nature ensured that her talents were well in demand. Blackie's publication of <span class="italic">Flower Fairies of the Spring</span> (1923) was quickly followed by the other seasons. Barker's poetry was published in several magazines as well as being collected in <span class="italic">Old Rhymes for All Times</span> (1928), for which she did her own illustrations. The flowers in Barker's books are intricately drawn and botanically correct.<br>
<br>Barker was a devout Church of England Christian and her faith informed her works, whether religious or secular. She designed several memorial pieces, including the <span class="italic">Art of Great Tribulation</span> in the memorial chapel at Norbury Methodist Church and the reredos triptych <span class="italic">The Feeding of the Five Thousand</span> for the chapel at Llandaff House, Penarth (1929). <span class="italic">A Flower Fairy Alphabet</span> (1934) described a fairyland wherein Christian values are fundamental. Several books for children followed, the best-known being <span class="italic">The Lord of Rushie River</span> (1938), which details the adventures of a child who communicates with swans. During the Second World War Barker published <span class="italic">Flower Fairies of the Trees</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Flower Fairies of the Garden</span> (1944). She also illustrated many texts, including R. L. Stevenson's <span class="italic">A Child's Garden of Verses</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Barker never married. She lived with her sister and her mother for most of her life. After their deaths, Barker's health deteriorated and she spent much of her time in nursing homes. She died at Storrington, Sussex, on 16 February 1973, and was buried there on 1 March. Her fairy books remain very popular and have been collected in many anthologies, while her flower and fairy paintings continue to be the focus of collectors.<br>
