<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  Peter</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1592, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, on 15 October 1592, the eldest of four sons of Sir Thomas Temple, first baronet (1567&#150;1637), of Stowe, and his wife, Hester (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of Miles Sandys. Sir Peter's grandfather John Temple, who also had lands in Leicestershire and Warwickshire, acquired the freehold of Stowe in 1590; Sir Thomas purchased the baronetcy in 1611. Peter Temple bought a knighthood in February 1609 and inherited both baronetcy and estates on the death of his father in February 1637. He was already twice married. He married his first wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Arthur Throckmorton of Northamptonshire, on 5 July 1614; the couple had two sons who died in infancy and two daughters, Anne and Martha, at whose birth Anne Temple died in January 1620. Their daughter Anne later married Thomas Roper, second Viscount Baltinglass, and her inheritance became an important source of Sir Peter's financial difficulties. His second marriage, on 20 May 1630, was to Christian (<i>b</i>. in or before 1596, <i>d</i>. 1655), daughter and coheir of Sir John Leveson of Staffordshire; they had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27118/', "Sir Richard Temple, third baronet (1634&#150;1697)")</script>, of Stowe, and at least seven daughters.<br>
<br>Temple held a number of posts in Buckinghamshire: he was high sheriff in 1634&#150;5; JP for the town of Buckingham and its MP in the Short and the Long parliaments; and a member of the county committee in 1643. As sheriff he had the misfortune to be responsible for the assessment and collection of ship money from a particularly recalcitrant county. Arrears were still outstanding in July 1636 despite several summons by the privy council, though the final shortfall was small. Although he was not very active in the Long Parliament, Temple supported the parliamentarian cause, but was probably inhibited by the divided allegiance of his family; his wife and some of her relatives were royalists. However, he used his influence to help his relations, including recusants threatened with sequestration. He served as colonel of a parliamentarian regiment but was no republican. He was appointed to the high court of justice to try the king but did not appear, and resigned his commission after Charles was executed. In 1652 an informant alleged that Temple had said he hoped to see the king in England soon and that the Commons had murdered the late king. He denied the charge and seemingly no proceedings were taken against him.<br>
<br>Another reason for Temple's political inactivity may have been his financial problems. For several generations the Temple family had incurred debts, partly to acquire land. Sir Peter was permanently short of money despite an income of &pound;700 a year from the dowry lands of his first wife, a dowry of &pound;3000 from his second, and &pound;800 annually from his father. His father, with whom he shared a mutual hostility, accused him of wasting money in gambling, drinking, and other extravagances; Sir Peter claimed he never received the full marriage settlement promised in 1614. His reduced rental income as his tenants' and his own property were pillaged added to his problems. By 1647 his creditors launched a joint legal suit which continued for six years. For much of the time he was unable to travel openly for fear of being seized for debt; in 1650 he thwarted an attempt in parliament to have his whole estate sold, arguing that &#145;selling my whole estate and the utter undoing of me and my posterity after me&#146; was &#145;contrary to right&#146;  (Gay, &#145;Debt settlement&#146;, 257). Finally, in August 1653, an agreement was reached that a group of his creditors should administer the estate except Stowe Manor House and some of its lands for ten years, or longer if Temple still lived. The income, apart from an allowance for his widow and son, would repay his debts of &pound;24,000. The agreement was nullified by Temple's sudden death on 12 September 1653; he was buried at Stowe. Despite his financial problems he was well regarded by some: his brother-in-law Sir John Lenthall said, &#145;he was in his lifetime accounted a person of great credit and integrity, and enjoyed a plentiful estate both real and personal&#146;  (ibid., 256). He left a number of papers, including personal correspondence and two account books, covering the years 1625&#150;6 and 1642&#150;53, now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.<br>
