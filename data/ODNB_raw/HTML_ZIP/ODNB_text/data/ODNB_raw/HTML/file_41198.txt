<span class="headword">Russell, Sir  Thomas Wallace</span>, first baronet  (1841&#150;1920), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 28 February 1841 in Cupar, Fife, the third son of David Russell (<i>d</i>. 1862), a stonemason, and his wife, Isabella Wallace (<i>d</i>. 1847). He was educated at Madras Academy, Cupar, and migrated to Ulster in 1859. He settled in Donaghmore, co. Tyrone, where he held various positions, including a clerkship in a soap factory and a sales assistantship in a drapery store. He married Harriet, daughter of Thomas Agnew of Dungannon, on 29 September 1865; the couple had two daughters. Harriet died in 1894. On 23 May 1896 he married Martha Catherine Keown (<i>d</i>. in or after 1939), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Keown of Castleroe, Londonderry, with whom he had a son and a daughter. His son and heir, a lieutenant in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, was killed on the western front in November 1916.<br>
<br>Russell was a self-made man of formidable political and administrative talents. He was an effective polemicist and journalist; he was also an unflagging and popular platform speaker who&#151;along with the more conservative Edward Saunderson&#151;did much to represent the Irish unionist case to British audiences in the 1880s. Later in his career he demonstrated considerable ability as a junior minister, and held office under both Lord Salisbury and H. H. Asquith. He applied his talents within three main fields: temperance, unionism, and land reform. These were the governing principles of much of his career, and the foundation for all three was an evangelical Presbyterian faith. This provided biblical vindication for sobriety, and stimulated Russell to defend the political interests of Irish protestants, and especially of the Presbyterian farming community.<br>
<br>Russell's advocacy of temperance laid the foundations for his later emergence as a politician of national significance. In 1863 he was elected secretary of the Dungannon Temperance Society, and used the post as a springboard to a full-time career within the temperance movement: in 1864 he was appointed as agent of the Irish Temperance League in Dublin, with a brief to convert the whole of the south of Ireland to the cause. Temperance brought Russell a training in public oratory and in polemical journalism; it also brought financial security, for in the mid-1870s he and his wife opened what would become a highly successful temperance hotel in central Dublin.<br>
<br>Although Russell had little regard for landlordism and some tacit sympathy for Irish national aspirations, his Scottish Presbyterian roots and temperance convictions led him naturally into the Liberal Unionist ranks in the mid-1880s. His first attempt to get into the Commons, as the Liberal candidate at Preston in 1885, was a failure; but he found greater electoral favour in his home territory of South Tyrone, where in July 1886 he defeated the leading Parnellite William O'Brien. (O'Brien was both an opponent of the union and of temperance reformers, whom he designated as &#145;that sect of Puritans&#146;.) Russell held the constituency until January 1910: thereafter (1911&#150;18) he represented North Tyrone. Between 1886 and 1900 he was a highly effective, if independent-minded, advocate of the Unionist cause, addressing some 1400 meetings and working closely with the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union (Irish Unionist Alliance). Gladstone considered Russell's contribution to debate on the second <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> (1893) as among the best delivered in the Commons. Other Liberals (such as A. E. Pease) recognized the threat that Russell represented as a stump orator.<br>
<br>However, Russell's loyalty to unionism depended upon the movement's capacity to satisfy his farmer support. This loyalty survived, albeit in a bruised form, until 1900. Russell launched a rural agitation in 1894&#150;5 designed to bolster farmer support for a Liberal land bill: this outraged his Conservative critics within the Unionist alliance. In 1895, on the formation of Lord Salisbury's third ministry, Russell was silenced with junior office (the parliamentary secretaryship of the Local Government Board) and by the promise of a Unionist land bill. But in the late 1890s Russell was moving towards a more radical settlement of the Irish land question; and in September 1900 at Clogher, co. Tyrone, he declared in favour of compulsory land purchase. This speech led to his dismissal from the government, and to a period of independent dissent and political reorientation.<br>
<br>Between 1900 and 1906 Russell challenged mainstream unionism for the command of the protestant farmer vote. His supporters won two by-elections, wresting East Down (1902) and North Fermanagh (1903) from Unionist control and provoking panic within the Unionist movement as a whole. The early success of Russell's agitation had profound repercussions. It further chivvied the Unionist government towards a sweeping measure of land purchase, and it stimulated a comprehensive overhaul of Ulster Unionist electoral machinery. These measures simultaneously underlined the seriousness with which Russell was viewed, and helped to deflate the agitation that he had created.<br>
<br>In the wake of Wyndham's <span class="roman">Land Act</span> (1903) and the creation of the Ulster Unionist Council (1904&#150;5), Russell's land movement began to flounder. Having been estranged from unionism, and having failed to create a lasting independent movement, he joined the Liberal Party in 1906: his most significant publication, <span class="italic">Ireland and the Empire</span> (1901), looked forward to this development. In 1907 he succeeded Sir Horace Plunkett as vice-president of the Irish department of agriculture and technical instruction. He held this office until 1918. He was sworn of the Irish privy council in 1908, and awarded a baronetcy in 1917. He died in Dublin on 2 May 1920, aware that the final collapse of British rule in Ireland was approaching, and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, as he had wished, three days later.<br>
<br>Russell was a Victorian faddist&#151;a radical nonconformist who combined unwavering conviction with very considerable political skill. The crusading zeal that he had applied to the cause of temperance was transferred to the land question. But his passion and eloquence were not always accompanied by political realism or even tact. He made demands of the Unionist alliance that, given the alliance's fissile nature, could not be granted. He was too idiosyncratic to be restrained by any one party, and yet too able to be denied access to party politics. That he held ministerial rank under both a Unionist and a Liberal administration is a reflection of both his talents and his obtuseness.<br>
