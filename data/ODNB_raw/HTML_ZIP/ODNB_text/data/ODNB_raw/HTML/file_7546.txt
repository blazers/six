<span class="headword">Des Maizeaux,  Pierre</span>  (1672/3&#150;1745), <span class="occ">biographer and journalist</span>, was born at Paillat in the Auvergne, France, the only child of Louis Des Maizeaux (<i>d</i>. 1701), protestant pastor, and Marie Dumonteil (<i>d</i>. 1726). In 1685, after his father was indicted for sedition for an incautious remark in a sermon about Louis XIV and the revocation of the edict of Nantes, the family fled to Switzerland. Des Maizeaux was educated at the lyceum in Bern (1690&#150;95) and the academy in Geneva (1695&#150;9), where he studied theology. He had an early reputation for independence of mind and left for England in 1699 before completing his studies, never to return. His father, who expected him to become a pastor, found his son's abandonment of a ministerial career hard to forgive.<br>
<br>Des Maizeaux passed through the Netherlands where he made contacts in the book trade and met the great Huguenot religious philosopher Pierre Bayle. In England he at first made a living as a tutor and writer, but soon began to search for a secure patronage appointment, which constantly eluded him, although he obtained timely, if modest, help from Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, Joseph Addison, Lord Halifax, and Thomas Parker, lord chancellor. His legal position in England was secured when he was naturalized in 1708, and his finances improved enough for him to abandon tutoring when he gained an Irish pension, through Addison's patronage, in 1710. He lived in rented accommodation in London, mostly in or near Soho, near St Martin's Lane.<br>
<br>In 1700 Des Maizeaux began to contribute articles and literary news on English books and their authors to French-language journals in the Netherlands and France. This became a staple for more than four decades through which he made a wide range of English writing and thought better known on the continent. He was an early theorist of the literary journal, and recognized its significance for realizing the ideal of the republic of letters. His friends and acquaintances in England included Hans Sloane, secretary of the Royal Society; the freethinkers John Toland and Anthony Collins, whose friendship and intellectual compatibility was significant; Richard Steele and Joseph Addison; Dr Richard Mead, celebrated physician and antiquarian book collector; the French booksellers in the Strand; and the Huguenot intellectuals who regularly met at the Rainbow Coffee House and later at Slaughter's in St Martin's Lane [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94590', "Rainbow Coffee House group")</script>]. He befriended the Epicurean satirist and exile Charles de Saint-Evremond, then living in London, and jointly edited his works and wrote his biography (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres m&ecirc;l&eacute;es de Saint-Evremond</span>, 2 vols., 1705, and <span class="italic">M&eacute;langes curieux</span>, 2 vols., 1706).<br>
<br>Bayle, however, is the central figure in Des Maizeaux's literary career. Des Maizeaux won Bayle's respect and friendship while sending him material for the second edition of Bayle's <span class="italic">Dictionnaire historique et critique</span> (3 vols., 1702) and defended the philosopher's reputation against slanderous attacks in England. His early journalism, including his critique of Cartesian proofs of God's existence and a draft criticism of Leibniz, was favourably received by Bayle. Des Maizeaux wrote two lives of Bayle, the first, <span class="italic">The Life of Mr. Bayle</span> (1708), appeared soon after Bayle's death in 1706, while the other, <span class="italic">La vie de l'auteur</span> (1730), is often viewed as his best biographical writing, notwithstanding its hagiographic treatment of its subject. He portrayed Bayle less as a systematic sceptic and more as a freethinker acutely aware of the limits of human reason. He collected and edited Bayle's correspondence twice. The first time his edition was appropriated by Prosper Marchand (<span class="italic">Lettres choisies de Mr. Bayle</span>, 3 vols., 1714), which provoked a protracted literary quarrel between the rival claimants to Bayle's literary heritage; the second edition was <span class="italic">Lettres de Bayle</span> (3 vols., 1729). He extended Bayle's historical-critical method to English lives, and published lives of two seventeenth-century latitudinarians, John Hales and William Chillingworth. The model was later adopted and extended in the <span class="italic">General Dictionary Historical and Critical</span> (10 vols., 1734&#150;41), with which he was associated and to which he contributed lives of Addison and materials for its life of Collins. Several of its other articles rely on his biographies. A set of rare lives in French that he had collected was published, but not as a collection, in Dutch periodicals. The most controversial was <span class="italic">La vie de Spinose</span>, which had previously circulated clandestinely in manuscript; its publication in <span class="italic">Nouvelles litt&eacute;raires</span> (10, 1719, 40&#150;74) provoked strong critical reaction. His antiquarian interests were also reflected in his edition of a volume of rare sixteenth-century Latin love poetry by Jean Bonnefons, from a book he borrowed from the earl of Sunderland; it was published as <span class="italic">Johannis Bonefonii Arverni carmina</span> (1720).<br>
<br>Des Maizeaux edited two significant collections. The first, <span class="italic">Collection of Several Pieces of John Locke</span> (1720), used materials largely supplied by his friend Anthony Collins. The second, <span class="italic">Recueil de diverses pi&egrave;ces</span> (2 vols., 1720), includes Samuel Clarke's celebrated correspondence with Leibniz and Anthony Collins's dispute with Clarke on human liberty, as well as shorter pieces on the dispute between Newton and Leibniz on the discovery of the calculus and other Leibnizian material. Newton tried to delay or divert the publication of the correspondence on the calculus which, as he anticipated, reignited a dispute he did not wish to see revived. For his publication of <span class="italic">Receuil</span>, Des Maizeaux was made a fellow of the Royal Society (1720), an honour he highly valued. He also edited John Toland's posthumous papers, <span class="italic">Collection of Several Pieces of Mr. John Toland</span> (2 vols., 1726), to which he added a biographical sketch. When Collins died, it was expected that Des Maizeaux would do the same for him, but he sold the manuscripts Collins had left him to Collins's widow, an action he regretted, but was unable to undo.<br>
<br>Not all of Des Maizeaux's writings were well received. His <span class="italic">Life of Boileau</span> (1712) provoked Warburton's witticism that Des Maizeaux seemed to believe that &#145;every Life must be a Book; and, what is worse, it seems a Book without a Life&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.546). He was attracted to individuals such as the latitudinarians and freethinkers with an adventurous cast of mind who challenged orthodoxy, but he became increasingly cautious about revealing much of himself, particularly when not writing anonymously. In his life of Hales he declared he would give no basis to the charges made against Bayle of writing obscenely or undermining religion. Lord Molesworth thought he would do better &#145;if he would imitate Monsr. Bayle more&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4465, fol. 36, undated letter, John Toland to Molesworth). Nevertheless, the free examination of ideas and toleration are themes which inform his writing. Some 1300 letters from more than 200 correspondents sent to Des Maizeaux survive in the British Library. They include one from the young David Hume in 1739 soliciting Des Maizeaux's opinion of his philosophical writing. Collectively they illuminate the state of the republic of letters of which Des Maizeaux viewed himself a citizen.<br>
<br>For much of his life Des Maizeaux was in financial need and poor health, both of which impeded his literary projects. Nevertheless, he was generous and provided money to his mother, to John Toland, and to Richard Steele. He was a rotund figure, and a French visitor to London in 1724 described him in appearance as &#145;un pauvre cancre&#146; (&#145;a poor wretch&#146;; <span class="italic">Journal et m&eacute;moires de Matthieu Marais</span>, 3.272). In the 1730s he was living with a common-law wife, Ann Brown, and her young daughter, of whom he was possibly the father. They married at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 2 February 1740 to facilitate the transfer of his pension in anticipation of his death, which took place on 11 July 1745.<br>
