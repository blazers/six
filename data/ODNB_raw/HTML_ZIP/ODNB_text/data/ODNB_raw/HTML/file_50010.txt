<span class="headword">Russell, Sir  Baker Creed</span>  (1837&#150;1911), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Ravensworth, New South Wales, on 7 December 1837, the son of Captain the Hon. W. Russell of the 73rd foot and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of Dr Martin of the 73rd. Commissioned as an ensign in the 6th dragoon guards on 2 November 1855, Russell joined his regiment in India. Promoted lieutenant on 1 August 1856, Russell was stationed at Meerut in 1857 at the outbreak of the mutiny. He saw action at Karnaul and distinguished himself with Sir Thomas Seaton's column at Gungaree and Patiali, the recurring casualties among senior officers propelling Russell into squadron command. In 1858 he served in central India with the Agra field force in its pursuit of Tantia Topi. Promotion to a captaincy by purchase was on 18 February 1859 and, following transfer to the 13th hussars in 1862, Russell received a brevet majority on 24 January 1865. In 1866 he married Pauline Henrietta, daughter of Captain Henry Hunter of the 5th dragoon guards. A striking woman, Pal, as she was known to Lady Wolseley, apparently had a somewhat stormy relationship with Russell.<br>
<br>Regimental service followed until, in September 1873, Russell's reputation as a good fighting man led to selection as a special service officer on Sir Garnet Wolseley's Asante expedition: he commanded one of two locally raised native regiments and played a prominent part in the action at Abrakampa on 5 November. Subsequently his regiment formed part of the advance guard during the march on Kumasi. Wolseley wrote, &#145;I wish I had a hundred men like him here&#146;  (Wolseley to Lady Wolseley, 27 Nov 1873, W/P 3/15). To H. M. Stanley, then a war correspondent, Russell appeared &#145;a resolute, hard-handed man, with vim and nerve in him, a sharp sword for an enemy, and a soft tongue for a friend&#146;  (Temple, 124). For his services Russell received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 1 April 1874 and the CB.<br>
<br>Russell was now identified as one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring (act. 1873&#150;1890)")</script>, which was advantageous and disadvantageous. He was assured of employment on expeditions commanded by Wolseley, as in July 1878 when he accompanied Wolseley to Cyprus as assistant military secretary, although staff work was not his strength. However, Wolseley's opponents in the military establishment obstructed his advancement, and in March 1879 he resigned his Cyprus appointment rather than be seconded from his regiment. Later in 1879 Russell joined Wolseley in South Africa for the closing stages of the Anglo-Zulu War, employed primarily as a column commander operating against the Pedi chief Sekukuni, against whose final stronghold Russell personally led the assault, having his horse shot under him. However, Russell was able to remain in South Africa only by Wolseley's refusal to return him to his regiment in India. Russell had been promoted major on 15 July 1878 and he was now created KCMG but was not given the further promotion for which Wolseley strove on his behalf. Russell was given the unattached rank of colonel on 18 February 1880 and regimental rank as lieutenant-colonel on 29 September 1880.<br>
<br>In 1882 Wolseley wanted Russell for his Egyptian expedition, but opposition from the commander-in-chief, the duke of Cambridge, and the prince of Wales restricted his initial appointment to assistant adjutant-general to the cavalry division. Once in Egypt, however, Wolseley promptly gave Russell local rank as brigadier-general and appointed him to command the 1st cavalry brigade. Again Russell showed great skill as a cavalry commander&#151;he had once remarked that the purpose of cavalry was &#145;to look pretty in time of peace and to get killed in war&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">First Boer War</span>, 227)&#151;again having his horse shot under him, at Qassasin on 9 September. Russell's reward was the KCB.<br>
<br>Egypt was Russell's last campaign, since in 1884 Wolseley was unable to find a place for him on the Gordon relief expedition, with a resulting cooling of their relationship. In 1886 Russell became inspecting officer of auxiliary cavalry but took up the command at Shorncliffe later that year. He was promoted major-general on 1 April 1889 and took command of the cavalry brigade at Aldershot from 1890 to 1895. He commanded north-west district from 1895 to 1898, receiving promotion to lieutenant-general on 20 January 1897. His final appointment before retirement was at southern command from 1898 to 1904. He had become colonel of the 13th hussars on 20 January 1904 and received promotion to full general on 19 December 1903. He was made GCB in 1900. Russell died at his home, 10 Trinity Crescent, Folkestone, on 25 November 1911, survived by his wife.<br>
