<span class="headword">Dodds,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1874), <span class="occ">public lecturer and poet</span>, was born on 6 February 1813 at Softlaw, near Kelso, Roxburghshire, the illegitimate son of Christian Dodds. James was brought up by his grandfather, a member of the Secession church, for whose humble, pious, and proselytizing character he had a lifelong admiration. From his earliest years he showed great abilities, a very impulsive and imaginative nature, and a daring, and sometimes adventurous, spirit. He was enabled through the sponsorship of friends to attend the University of Edinburgh, where he became well known among his companions for his remarkable powers of speech. He was, in succession, an actor in an itinerant theatrical company; schoolmaster at Sandyknowe; apprentice for five years to a Melrose lawyer, who seems to have experimented how to extract from a clerk the largest amount of work for the smallest amount of pay; then, in 1841, a lawyer's clerk in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh Dodds served in the office of a firm of which John Hunter, writer to the signet, a connection of Lord Jeffrey, and well known in the literary circles of Edinburgh, was a member. Mr Hunter treated Dodds as a friend, and introduced him to many literary men. Thomas Carlyle, to whom he wrote regularly, gave him advice about his professional and artistic decisions. This friendship continued for many years, and when, in 1846, Dodds moved to London to become a parliamentary solicitor, he regularly visited Carlyle. From 1845 to 1847 he wrote the &#145;Lays of the covenanters&#146;. These historical and biographical sketches of the victims of seventeenth-century religious persecutions appeared in different journals in Edinburgh, and were gathered into a volume in 1880. Dodds was also very close to Leigh Hunt whom he met in London. Hunt being constantly in pecuniary and other difficulties found in Dodds a most valuable friend. &#145;More than once he took the management of his affairs, giving him legal advice, conferring with his creditors, and arranging about the payment or partial payment of his debts&#146;  (Dodds, 80).<br>
<br>In the 1850s Dodds delivered many lectures on the subject of the Scottish covenanters; usually these were given in Scottish towns, but occasionally to metropolitan audiences; one of his lectures, in which he combined prose and poetry, lays and lecture, was given to an enthusiastic London assemblage of 3000 people. These lectures were composed with scrupulous historical care. When they came to be published in 1861 as <span class="italic">The Fifty Years' Struggle of the Covenanters, 1638&#150;1688</span>, renewed pains were taken to make sure of accuracy. During this period, he also helped to secure the erection of the Wallace monument in Stirling. It was his intention to give another series of lectures on the Scottish Reformation, but of these only two were written. His natural eloquence, and his way of throwing his soul into the delivery, gave him great popularity and power as a lecturer. A lecture on Thomas Chalmers, for whom he had an intense admiration, developed into a volume of great interest. Dodds died of heart disease at Gordon Street, Lochee, Dundee, on 12 September 1874, and was survived by his widow, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pringle.<br>
