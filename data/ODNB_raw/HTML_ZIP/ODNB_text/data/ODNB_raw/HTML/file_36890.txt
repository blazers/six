<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wigram,  Clive</span>, first Baron Wigram  (1873&#150;1960), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was born on 5 July 1873 at Madras, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Wigram (1842&#150;1914), of the Madras civil service, and Amy Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of Lieutenant-General John Wood Rideout, of the Indian army. He was educated at Winchester College (1886&#150;91), where he excelled at games, most notably cricket, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1891&#150;3). In 1893 he was commissioned in the Royal Artillery and two years later he was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Elgin, viceroy of India. He served with the 18th Bengal lancers in the Tirah campaign on the north-west frontier in 1897&#150;8, and in 1900 joined Kitchener's horse in the South African War, where he was mentioned in dispatches. Life in a vice-regal establishment suited Wigram and he returned to India as aide-de-camp to Lord Curzon, who succeeded Elgin as viceroy. When the prince of Wales (later George V) visited India in 1905 his chief of staff, Sir Walter Lawrence, invited Wigram to be his assistant. Wigram became military secretary to the commander-in-chief at Aldershot in 1908 but, upon the accession of George V in 1910, he exchanged a promising military career to be equerry and assistant private secretary to the king. Sporty and down-to-earth, with chauvinist views typical of many army officers, Wigram suited the king's taste for simplicity and directness in his aides. Tall, handsome, and athletic, he was the model of the soldierly courtier.<br>
<br>George V's reign was marked by war, industrial unrest, and the advent of socialism and universal suffrage, all of which the king took to be a danger to the crown. Given the many crises of the reign the office of the private secretary became increasingly important to the monarchy. For most of his career in royal service Wigram served as assistant to the sagacious Arthur Bigge, Lord Stamfordham, from whom he learned the niceties of the king's constitutional position and the need to be well informed and trusted by all parties. At the end of the First World War social malaise and the drift of democratic politics galvanized the monarchy into defending its position more vigorously. The king's advisers felt obliged to consider a more coherent strategy of self-defence than palace precedent provided. In view of the constitutional constraints this meant forging bonds of affection at home and across the empire. Wigram was among the palace reformers and once described those who opposed any changes in the dignity and status of the sovereign as &#145;Palace Troglodytes&#146;  (Rose, 227). A master of propaganda and imaginative gestures, he wanted greater publicity given to imperial tours and welfare missions to working-class communities. He called for a full-time press officer, who was appointed in 1918, and urged the royal family to widen its social circle. Behind the scenes he monitored expressions of republicanism in the Labour Party and, through contacts outside government, kept the king informed of Communist Party activity. He was created KCVO in 1928, later promoted GCVO.<br>
<br>Wigram was appointed private secretary to the king after Stamfordham's death in 1931, and the following year was sworn of the privy council. He lacked Stamfordham's intellectual gifts or skill as a draftsman, but beneath the bluff exterior of an Indian army colonel there was shrewdness and purpose. He knew the king's mind and could draw on a wide circle of friends and contacts for advice. Within months of his appointment as private secretary, in the depths of the depression, he had to face a political crisis of the first magnitude. Personally, he favoured setting up an emergency government and supported the king's decision to intervene to that end. The use of the royal prerogative led to the formation of the National Government, with Ramsay MacDonald at its head. Though he acted on advice the king's role was contentious, not least because it led to a division in the Labour Party. At the time several Labour MPs accused him of political meddling.<br>
<br>George V was highly sensitive to what he felt to be encroachments on his prerogative and threats to the integrity of the empire, and in the final years of his reign Wigram had to deal with, among other issues, the appointment of governors-general, the rise of Indian nationalism, and German rearmament. More agreeably he oversaw the festivities surrounding the king's silver jubilee in 1935, an event which he described as &#145;a dream&#151;a miracle arranged by Providence&#146;  (Royal Archives, GV P633/324). In jubilee year he was made a peer (25 June) and appointed keeper of the privy purse. Within months of the celebrations his duties extended to nursing the ailing king. It was to Wigram that George V spoke his dying words, asking about the state of the empire.<br>
<br>Wigram stayed on as private secretary, to settle in the new king, but their relations were uneasy from the start. Edward VIII regarded Wigram as a courtier of the old school, which did not recommend him. For his part Wigram was all too familiar with the king's failings and soon came to believe that his state of mind bordered on insanity. He left Edward's service in July 1936 but was recalled by George VI, albeit briefly, after the abdication and appointed permanent lord-in-waiting and extra equerry. During his career as a palace official he also served as deputy constable and lieutenant-governor of Windsor Castle, and keeper of the Royal Archives. For many years he and his family lived in the Norman tower at Windsor. A keen gardener and fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, he converted the moat garden into a botanical showpiece. He retired to London in 1945.<br>
<br>During and after his long period in royal service Wigram was active in charitable and educational institutions, where his connections and buoyant humour were much valued. He was a fellow of his old school, Winchester, and a governor of Wellington College and Haileybury College. He served as president of the Westminster Hospital, vice-president of King Edward VII's Sanatorium, vice-president of the National Association of Boys Clubs, and was on the board of King George's Jubilee Trust. On 5 December 1912 he had married Nora Mary, only daughter of Colonel Sir Neville Chamberlain. They had two sons, the younger of whom was killed in action in 1943, and a daughter. Lady Wigram died on 5 January 1956 and their daughter two years later. Thereafter Wigram's mental and physical powers declined. He died in London on 3 September 1960 and was succeeded in his title by his surviving son, George Neville Clive. It would be easy to underrate his career in royal service. Not only was most of it spent in the shadow of Lord Stamfordham but the discretion and secrecy surrounding court life cloaked the machinations behind the throne. But in an era in which the monarchy felt threatened Wigram, despite his conservatism, was among the principal architects of its transformation into an institution more in tune with social democracy. There is a tablet to his memory in the north choir aisle of St George's Chapel, Windsor.<br>
