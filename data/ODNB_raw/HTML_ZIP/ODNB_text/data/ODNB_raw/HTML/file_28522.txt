<span class="headword">Walkington,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1621), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Lincoln, possibly the son of Thomas Walkington (<i>c</i>.1548&#150;1620?), a Lincolnshire clergyman. He matriculated as a pensioner from St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1597 and MA in 1600. On 26 March 1602 he was elected fellow of the college, and in 1607 he published the work for which he is primarily remembered, <span class="italic">The Optick Glasse of Humors, or, The Touchstone of a Golden Temperature</span>. Dedicated to Sir Justinian Lewin from Walkington's college study on 10 March, this engaging account of Galen's four temperamental types went beyond the usual expository tradition of such treatises, and has been regarded as something of a curiosity. Lively, witty, and concerned at least as much to entertain as instruct, it foreshadowed the literary culmination of the tradition in Burton's <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span>.<br>
<br>Although Walkington henceforth turned his attention to a clerical career, his few surviving sermons show a continuing fascination with the effects of language and style. In 1608 he completed his BD and published a sermon on <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> 12: 10, preached at Thetford &#145;before his Majestie, by Thomas Walkington Batchelour in Divinitie, and fellow of S. Johns Colledge in Cambridge&#146;. <span class="italic">Salomon's Sweete Harpe; Consisting of Five Words, Like so many Golden Strings</span> is a paean to the &#145;heavenly art&#146; of speaking  (p. 9), and was dedicated to a fellow Johnsman, Thomas Howard, earl of Suffolk and lord chamberlain, on 28 June. In it Walkington also advocated strong measures against Brownism and other divisive movements within the church, and it is perhaps not coincidental that he was presented the same year to the vicarage of Raunds, Northamptonshire, an area closely associated with Brownist activity. In 1610 Walkington became rector of Waddingham St Mary, Lincolnshire; he was incorporated BD at Oxford on 14 July 1612, proceeded DD at Cambridge in 1613, and finally on 25 May 1615 was appointed vicar of Fulham, Middlesex.<br>
<br>In 1620 Walkington published his last known work, <span class="italic">Rabboni</span>, an elegiac sermon on <span class="roman">John</span> 20: 16 &#145;preached at S. Paulls Crosse &hellip; By Thomas Walkington, Doctor in Divinity and Minister of the Word at Fulham&#146;. For its dedication, &#145;To Rabboni&#146; or Christ, Walkington now turned inwards to a spiritual rather than worldly patron; and in another virtuoso display of passion and rhetoric, he invoked the glory of the life to come&#151;&#145;the day of our life is far spent&#146;  (sig. A7). Walkington died at Fulham the following year; the administration of his goods was granted on 29 October 1621.<br>
<br>After his death <span class="italic">The Optick Glasse</span> went into several further editions. An undated edition, which cannot be dated earlier than 1627, was printed by William Turner at Oxford. This issue retains the 1607 dedication but substitutes a title-page elaborately engraved on steel, showing an optic glass held aloft by two graduates in cap and gown, who represent respectively the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The universities are further depicted in a facing engraving, above a diagram of the humours abstracted from page 39 of the 1607 text. An identical London edition appeared in 1639; and in 1664 an edition appeared with both a printed title-page (dated 1664) and the later engraved version (dated 1663). W. C. Hazlitt describes an Oxford edition containing an extra leaf of dedication to the author's &#145;worshippefull, good friend M. Carye&#146;  (Hazlitt, <span class="italic">Bibliographical Collections</span>, 624), but, although the engravings may suggest Walkington's personal involvement with an edition published some time after 1612, there are no copies extant of such an edition.<br>
