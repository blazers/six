<span class="headword">Laing,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> 1856), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London and baptized there on 9 March 1775 at St Dunstan-in-the-East, the son of David Laing, a cork-cutter of Tower Street, London, and his wife, Ann. He was articled to John Soane in 1790, and was still in Soane's office when he exhibited a design for a saloon at the Royal Academy in 1795. The following year he established himself in private practice. Laing's career began slowly but with promise; in 1800 he erected a villa for one Griffith Jones at Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, and in 1803 he designed cottages at Easthampstead, Berkshire, for the marquess of Downshire. In 1800 he followed one of the time-honoured routes for aspirant architects by publishing a book of his designs: <span class="italic">Hints for Dwellings, Consisting of Original Designs for Cottages, Farm Houses, Villas, etc.</span> It was a popular work, reprinted in 1804, 1823, and 1841. He followed this in 1818 with <span class="italic">Plans etc. of Buildings, Public and Private, Executed in Various Parts of England, Including the Custom House</span>. Several of the designs were for specific patrons, such as the &#145;villa to be erected for a gentleman&#146; at Ballmahon in co. Longford, illustrated in <span class="italic">Hints</span>, or the house &#145;erected&#146; for General Sir J. Taylor at Castle Taylor, Ardrahan, Galway, in <span class="italic">Plans</span> (although Laing's role is unclear, and the house has been demolished).<br>
<br>In 1810 Laing was appointed surveyor to the customs. The expansion of Britain's trade, and consequently of the customs' business, promised to make this a valuable post. In the same year he began the new custom house in Plymouth, finished in 1811. It is a sober building of granite, five bays wide, the ground floor with rock-faced rustication, the upper floor with smooth ashlar masonry and five arched windows recessed in arched surrounds. Laing's design is distinguished and powerful, and betokened a brilliant career. In 1818&#150;19 he also rebuilt the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, drawings of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy, although his obituary suggested that most of the design work was done by William Tite, his then assistant; it was destroyed by bombing in 1941. Laing also built the corn exchange, High Street, Colchester (1825), a nine-bay building with an elegant colonnade of Greek Doric columns spanning the pavement in front.<br>
<br>In May 1812 came Laing's great opportunity, to rebuild the custom house on Thames Street in London, replacing Thomas Ripley's building of 1718. His original scheme, for a building on the north of Thames Street, approached by new docks on either side, was not accepted. Laing produced a simpler scheme for a massive rectangular block. The centre was of two storeys, with vaults for the &#145;king's warehouse&#146; below and the great &#145;long room&#146; above. To either side were great four-storey wings housing the offices. Laing's design for the fa&ccedil;ades was strong and innovative, and his long room, spanned with three shallow domes and clearly showing Soane's influence, would have been one of the finest neo-classical interiors in Britain. Laing's estimate was &pound;209,000, plus &pound;12,000 for piling and &pound;7000 for contingencies; the contractors, Miles and Peto, won the job with a tender of &pound;165,000.<br>
<br>The building of the custom house proved, however, to be one of the major architectural scandals of the nineteenth century, and the ruin of Laing's career. The problems centred on the failure of Laing's piled foundations, and his failure to supervise the contractors properly. Construction was dogged by delays and disputes between Laing and Miles and Peto. By late 1817 work was nearing completion, and the cost had soared above the estimates. A detailed series of reports by the office of works uncovered glaring discrepancies between what Laing had specified and the work executed, and he was suspected of fraudulent collusion with the contractors. This was never proved, but in 1821 Laing's conduct was widely believed to be in the highest degree improper and reprehensible. More seriously, cracks had appeared in the vault of the king's warehouse in 1820, and in 1824 part of the long room's river fa&ccedil;ade collapsed, followed by the king's warehouse vault and the long room floor. Sir Robert Smirke, called on to investigate, uncovered huge discrepancies between what was specified and paid for, and the work executed. Smirke carried out the reconstruction, underpinning the custom house with concrete foundations and rebuilding the central section as it stands today; by 1829 the total cost had risen to &pound;435,000. J. Mordaunt Crook observed that what the custom house gained in solidity it lost in architectural interest, as Smirke rebuilt Laing's long room and river fa&ccedil;ade to his own, more pedestrian, designs.<br>
<br>Following Smirke's damning report Laing was dismissed, his career destroyed by the fiasco. The only significant works by him after 1824 are Lexden Park, Colchester, Essex, for J. F. Mills (1825), altered beyond recognition in the 1850s, and the Royal Universal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Road, London, of 1833&#150;4 (dem.). In 1837 he found some work providing illustrations of public buildings for Peter Nicholson's <span class="italic">Practical Masonry, Bricklaying and Plastering</span>. In the 1840s he was living in Brighton, though no buildings by him are known there. Laing was reduced almost to destitution and lived on the charity of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution, the Fund for Distressed Architects, and the Surveyor's Club. He died at Brompton, where he had been living since <i>c</i>.1850, on 27 March 1856, aged eighty-two. A long and strikingly generous obituary in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> (5 April 1856) sought to exculpate Laing from blame for the custom house disaster; it noted that such eminent architects as Charles Fowler and Sir William Tite had been his pupils, &#145;and have been happily more fortunate than their kind-hearted master&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 198).<br>
