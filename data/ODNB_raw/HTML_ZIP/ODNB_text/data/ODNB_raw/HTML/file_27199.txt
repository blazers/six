<span class="headword">Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas of Bayeux, Thomas (I) of York]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1100), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was of Norman descent and was archbishop from 1070 until his death in 1100. He was the son of a priest; a Durham obituary book records his parents' names as Osbertus and Muriel; such commemoration indicates his lifelong <i>pietas</i> (devotion) towards them. Thomas received a good education. He and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24600/', "Samson")</script> (bishop of Worcester, 1096&#150;1112) were among the promising young clerks for whom Bishop Odo of Bayeux paid to study at Li&egrave;ge and other cities; his studies may have taken him as far afield as Germany and Spain. In Normandy, he may also have been a pupil of Lanfranc, the future archbishop of Canterbury. In due course, Bishop Odo appointed him treasurer of Bayeux Cathedral. Thomas also served William I in England as a royal chaplain; he may have been a ducal chaplain in Normandy before 1066.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>The northern metropolitan see of York became vacant on the death on 11 September 1069 of the last Anglo-Saxon archbishop, Ealdred. On 23 May 1070, the day before the Council of Windsor, the king named Thomas of Bayeux to succeed; but no steps towards his consecration were taken until Lanfranc was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury on 29 August 1070. Thereafter, Thomas travelled to Canterbury, but, before he would consecrate him, Lanfranc required Thomas &#145;after the custom of his predecessors&#146; to give him a written profession of obedience reinforced by an oath of loyalty. Dissatisfied by the evidence that Lanfranc cited, Thomas refused on the grounds that the rights of the church of York forbade him to do otherwise; he left Canterbury without consecration. Upon hearing of these events, William I was angry. Lanfranc hastened to court, where he calmed the king's anger and won round the Normans who were present by an explanation of his case; according to the Canterbury account, the English fully supported Lanfranc. The king first cajoled and then browbeat, by threat of exile for himself and his family, a reluctant Thomas, so that, in late 1070 or early 1071, he returned to Canterbury for consecration. He made a profession of obedience to Lanfranc personally, with the reservation that he would not repeat such a profession to Lanfranc's successors until he had publicly received proof that his own predecessors had so done, and had rightly so done. His profession was probably made only verbally and not altogether according to the written formula that was prepared at Canterbury. In any case, no text of Thomas's first profession survives. Lanfranc proceeded to his consecration. (For these events, the Canterbury account in Lanfranc, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 38&#150;43 should be compared with the York account in Hugh the Chanter, <span class="italic">History of the Church of York</span>, 4&#150;7.)<h2>
<a name="RelationswithRome"></a>Relations with Rome</h2>In autumn 1071 Thomas travelled to Rome in company with Lanfranc and Remigius, bishop of Dorchester. During their visit, each archbishop received his pallium from Pope Alexander II. However, the York sources, especially Hugh the Chanter, were studiously silent about the visit, for which Canterbury evidence predominates. On the second day of the bishops' audience with the pope, in the course of other business, charges were made that neither Thomas nor Remigius had come canonically to the episcopate&#151;Thomas because he was a priest's son and Remigius because he had purchased it by services rendered to the king. Each surrendered his ring and staff and they threw themselves upon the papal mercy. When Lanfranc pleaded for them on the grounds of their learning and experience and of the king's need of them, Alexander allowed Lanfranc in his own presence to restore the bishops' insignia. During the audience Thomas advanced two claims on behalf of the church of York: first, as against Lanfranc's insistence upon the primacy of Canterbury, that the churches of Canterbury and York were equal in status to each other and that, by ordinance of Pope Gregory the Great, neither should be in any way subject to the other, save that precedence for the time being should belong to whichever archbishop was senior by consecration; and second, that the three bishops of Dorchester, Worcester, and Lichfield rightly owed obedience to York, not Canterbury. After long argument, Alexander ruled that the whole matter should be heard in England and there settled by the bishops and abbots of the whole kingdom. According to William of Malmesbury, Alexander wished to avoid offending either archbishop  (<span class="italic">Vita Wulfstani</span>, 25).<br>
<br>The matter was duly considered at a council held at Eastertide (<i>c</i>.8 April 1072) in the king's chapel in his castle at Winchester, and again at Pentecost (27 May) in the royal vill at Windsor; on both occasions, the papal legate Hubert was present. The evidence continues to come mainly from the Canterbury side: Lanfranc's report to Pope Alexander on events up to Easter 1072, together with the concord on the primacy which was formulated at Winchester and confirmed at Windsor, and Archbishop Thomas's second profession of obedience which followed. As at Rome, so at Winchester there was a prolonged debate during which, on the issue of the primacy, Lanfranc maintained the irrelevance of the dispositions of Pope Gregory I because he referred to the churches of London and York, not Canterbury and York. Lanfranc claimed that other arguments of Thomas were thin and weak. According to Lanfranc, King William rebuked Thomas gently and patiently for the weakness of his arguments. Thomas replied that he had not hitherto appreciated the strength of the precedents and arguments that Canterbury could deploy. He suppliantly besought Lanfranc to banish from his mind any rancour that the conflict might have engendered and to agree to a settlement that offered a few gracious concessions to York; he probably had in mind those which, given his dearth of suffragans other than Durham, would permit him to function as a metropolitan. Such, in Lanfranc's report, was the genesis of the concord adopted at Winchester.<br>
<br>The concord, of which Lanfranc sent the pope a copy, had the form of a judgement made with the king's agreement and in his presence by the bishops and abbots to whom the pope had referred the matter. As regards the relations of Canterbury and York, it recognized the vindication of the view that York should be subject to Canterbury and should obey the directions of its archbishop as primate of the whole of Britain in all matters relating to the Christian religion. The archbishop of York and his suffragans must obey the primate's summons to a council, wherever convened, and must also obey his lawful instructions. On the death of an archbishop of Canterbury, the archbishop of York should come to Canterbury and duly consecrate his successor, with the help of the other suffragans of the church of Canterbury, as his own primate; if the archbishop of York died, his successor should, however, come for consecration to Canterbury or to wherever the archbishop of Canterbury might direct. In one respect, Lanfranc did not get his way: as in 1070, he had pressed for what he considered the ancient right of the archbishop of Canterbury to require from the archbishop of York a public oath as well as a profession of obedience; &#145;out of love for the king&#146; (probably in fact because of the king's refusal), Lanfranc waived the oath in Thomas's case but reserved the position of his own successors who might wish to exact one. As regards jurisdiction over the three disputed dioceses, this was tacitly denied to the archbishop of York; the limit of his province was set to the north of the diocese of Lichfield and mostly at the River Humber, although by compensation he was given jurisdiction northwards &#145;to the furthest limits of Scotland&#146;. Thomas soon afterwards made an absolute profession of obedience to Lanfranc and his successors as archbishops of Canterbury and of due obedience to their just and canonical commands, adding the comment that when making his earlier profession he was uncertain on this matter and had promised obedience to Lanfranc unconditionally but to his successors conditionally. For Thomas's lifetime, the issue of the primacy was settled.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithCanterbury"></a>Relations with Canterbury</h2>So far as the authority of Canterbury is concerned, Thomas in general honoured the spirit and the letter of the settlement of 1072. Only two incidents call for notice. In perhaps 1086, according to the unsupported story of Hugh the Chanter, Lanfranc and Thomas accompanied King William to the Isle of Wight before his last crossing to Normandy. The king was told by someone unspecified of the York tradition that the concord of 1072 was a forgery of the Canterbury monks which they had fraudulently sealed. The king promised to decide the matter judicially if he returned to England. In 1093 there is an irreducible conflict of evidence about Thomas's stand when he consecrated Anselm archbishop of Canterbury. According to Hugh the Chanter, Thomas demurred to a petition that he consecrate Anselm &#145;primate of all Britain&#146; and required the phrase &#145;metropolitan of Canterbury&#146; to be substituted  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 12&#150;15). At Canterbury, Eadmer slightly more probably has Thomas objecting to the words &#145;metropolitan of all Britain&#146; with its implicit denial of York's metropolitan status but agreeing to &#145;primate of all Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia novorum</span>, 42&#150;3). For the rest, during Lanfranc's lifetime Thomas was present at the Council of London (1074 or 1075) which settled the precedence of the two archbishops and other prelates at church councils. In 1081, at Lanfranc's Council of Gloucester, upon the king's order and with Lanfranc's consent, Thomas consecrated William of St Calais to be bishop of Durham. Lanfranc and Thomas corresponded amicably upon pastoral matters. When the see of Canterbury was vacant from 1089 to 1093, Thomas was to the fore in consecrating bishops&#151;Ralph Luffa of Chichester (1091), Herbert de Losinga of Thetford (1091), and Hervey of Bangor (1092); but there is no sign of his taking advantage to press the claims of York. Hugh the Chanter cited a letter of Pope Urban II which, if genuine, probably dates from 1093 or 1094, summoning Thomas to account for his having in 1072 wrongly subjected his church to the archbishop of Canterbury  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 10&#150;13); there is no record that Thomas responded.<br>
<br>Thomas was only occasionally able to exercise the jurisdiction to the north which the concord of 1072 assigned to him. His best opportunity was in 1073, when Earl Paul of Orkney sent a clerk, Ralph, for episcopal consecration. Thomas arranged the ceremony at York on 3 March but required two further consecrators. Making no reference to his one suffragan of Durham, he wrote to Lanfranc with somewhat exaggerated deference, requesting the help of two bishops. He undertook to give no grounds for the suspicion once expressed by Bishop Remigius of Dorchester that he would claim a precedent for his own jurisdiction over him or his brother of Worcester. Lanfranc dispatched bishops Wulfstan of Worcester and Peter of Chester, whom he advised to keep Thomas's letter as a record of his undertaking. Hugh the Chanter claimed that, commanded by Malcolm III and Queen Margaret of Scotland, Bishop Fothad of St Andrews came to York, where he professed canonical subjection to the church and its archbishops.<br>
<br>To the south, Thomas had no lasting success. Prevented in 1072 from claiming bishoprics for his province, he could still claim &#145;appurtenances&#146; of his diocese that he had already sought but not secured at Rome in 1071. With support from Odo of Bayeux, he claimed twelve vills at Worcester which Archbishop Ealdred had retained after surrendering the see in 1062; but in 1072 the king's court decided against him. Bishop Remigius of Dorchester's transfer of his see to Lincoln occasioned greater difficulties, for Thomas claimed that the region of Lindsey, together with Lincoln, Stow, Louth, and Newark, belonged to his diocese. In 1092, when Remigius planned the consecration of his new cathedral, Thomas issued a prohibition, which Remigius ignored. William II, allegedly bribed by Remigius, allowed the consecration to go ahead; but when most of the bishops had assembled for it, Remigius's sudden death led to a postponement. When, on the day after his own consecration, Anselm of Canterbury was about to consecrate Remigius's successor, Robert Bloet, Thomas warned Anselm to consecrate him as bishop of Dorchester, not Lincoln. According to Hugh the Chanter, after a bribe of &pound;3000 King William in 1094 arranged a concord to settle the matter: Thomas (it was said unwillingly) surrendered his claim to Lincoln, Lindsey, Stow, and Louth, and received in return the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald at Gloucester.<h2>
<a name="Secularaffairsanddiocesanreform"></a>Secular affairs and diocesan reform</h2>Thomas seems to have been of exemplary loyalty to kings William I and II, but he took little known part in secular affairs. In 1088 he was at Salisbury during the trial for treason of Bishop William of St Calais; beforehand, he refused to counsel William, and during the trial he upheld the ruling of the king's court that William must do right to the king before being reinvested with his fief. But on William's deathbed in 1095, Thomas gave him the viaticum.<br>
<br>Thomas appears to best advantage in ordering his diocese, which, when he arrived, had been devastated by warfare, especially the Conqueror's harrying of the north in 1069. To his clergy, he showed a liberality that his successors deemed excessive. At York itself, in 1070 he found in the ruined cathedral only three of the meagre establishment of seven canons; he recalled the fugitives and created more canons. Having re-roofed and rehabilitated the old Anglo-Saxon cathedral, he rebuilt the refectory and dormitory to provide for a common life. Perhaps in the early 1080s, he built a new cathedral. He appointed a provost and recovered and increased the endowments. Perhaps in the early 1090s, Thomas deemed that better stewardship of cathedral property would result from the establishment of separate prebends for the canons. Having already appointed a master of the schools, he proceeded to introduce, on the Norman model, a dean, precentor (chanter), and treasurer. To assist with the oversight of his vast diocese, he appointed archdeacons.<br>
<br>Of Thomas's character, contemporaries were unanimous in their praise. A handsome and dignified man, he was agreeable in any company, whether engaged in serious business or honest fun; he inspired both respect and liking. He was a man of acknowledged piety and humility; and his observance of celibacy was unquestioned. He was a considerable musician who composed many hymns; he insisted that ecclesiastical chanting should be solemn and not effeminate. He was a good Latinist, who composed William the Conqueror's epitaph on his tomb at Caen. He was well versed in many branches of knowledge. His sterling reputation was widely known on the continent. Three of his kin became bishops: his brother Samson, who had also been treasurer of Bayeux and a royal chaplain, and at whose consecration Thomas assisted, became bishop of Worcester (1096&#150;1112); Samson's sons Thomas and Richard became respectively archbishop of York (1109&#150;14) and bishop of Bayeux (<i>c</i>.1108&#150;1133).<h2>
<a name="Death"></a>Death</h2>In 1100 Thomas heard at Ripon that William II had died on 2 August. He hastened to London, where he was indignant on finding that Henry I had already been crowned; since Anselm of Canterbury was abroad, he wished to implement his claim to officiate. But Thomas, who was weakened by sickness and age, was easily persuaded that the peace of the kingdom had demanded haste. He returned to the north after mid-September and on 18 November died at either York or Ripon. He was buried in York Minster near his predecessor Ealdred; Hugh the Chanter cited his epitaph  (<span class="italic">Hugh the Chanter</span>, 20&#150;21).<br>
