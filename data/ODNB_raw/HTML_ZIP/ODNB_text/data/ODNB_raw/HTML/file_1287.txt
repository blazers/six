<span class="headword">Bankes,  Henry</span>  (1757&#150;1834), <span class="occ">politician and parliamentary diarist</span>, was born on 19 December 1757; he was the second but only surviving son of Henry Bankes (<i>bap</i>. 1700, <i>d</i>. 1776), commissioner of customs, a member of the parliamentary dynasty descended from the royalist chief justice Sir John Bankes (1589&#150;1644) and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of John Wynne, bishop of Bath and Wells. Having been educated at Westminster School (1767&#150;73) he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1773 and graduated BA (1778) and MA (1781). In September 1776 he succeeded to his father's extensive Dorset estates and to the country house of Kingston Lacy, Wimborne, which he commissioned Robert William Brettingham to remodel from 1784. On 18 August 1784 he married Frances (1760/61&#150;1823), daughter of William Woodley (1728&#150;1793), MP and governor of the Leeward Islands, and Frances Payne. They had five sons and two daughters; two of his sons and one of his daughters predeceased him.<br>
<br>From 1780 Bankes represented the rotten borough of Corfe Castle, of which he was the electoral patron; his father had held the seat from 1741 to 1762. In the Commons he opposed Britain's prosecution of the war against the American colonies, and from the mid-1780s he was a supporter of the administrations of William Pitt, a personal friend. But he always pursued a self-righteously independent course in financial matters, reprobating the cost of continental warfare, advocating reductions in peacetime expenditure, and urging the abolition of sinecures. At times a dangerous critic of government his influence peaked in 1812, when he at last secured an&#151;albeit temporary&#151;act to prevent the granting of offices in reversion (52 Geo. III c. xl). Initially a friend to Catholic relief he gave his last vote in its favour in 1812 and announced his change of heart in a printed speech on 25 February 1813. A procedural expert and an indefatigable committee man he was active, for example, on behalf of the British Museum, of which he was a trustee. With a house at 5 Old Palace Yard, Westminster, which was occasionally used for political meetings, he was well placed for the life of a busy politician, and indeed he had his own recognized seat on the cross benches in the chamber. His manuscript parliamentary journal, which he kept for most of his career, provides an almost daily account of proceedings in the Commons, with illuminating comments on the abilities of the principal speakers. His scholarly reputation was made by the appearance in 1818 of his only published work, <span class="italic">The Civil and Constitutional History of Rome from its Foundation to the Age of Augustus F.P.</span>
<br>
<br>After several thwarted attempts to gain a county seat Bankes was finally elected for Dorset in February 1826. By that time a fierce critic of Catholic emancipation, he helped to lead the unsuccessful rearguard opposition of the ultra-tories against it in early 1829&#151;for instance, by his <span class="italic">Speech &hellip; in Defence of the Protestant Constitution</span> on 30 March. An alarmist over parliamentary reform he was defeated in Dorset by his whig rival, John Calcraft, at the general election of 1831. He declined to offer himself for the vacancy caused by Calcraft's suicide in September but his fifty years' service in parliament were celebrated at a tory dinner in Dorchester on 26 July 1832. He was considered a dull but earnest parliamentarian, although Nathaniel Wraxall observed in 1818 that his &#145;talents compensated by their calm solidity for the want of brilliancy. His enunciation, slow, formal, precise, and not without some degree of embarrassment, was nevertheless always controlled by judgment, caution, and good sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 4.80). He died at Tregothnan, near Truro, Cornwall, the home of his son-in-law Lord Falmouth, on 17 December 1834 and was buried at Wimborne Minster, Dorset, on 24 December. His estate was inherited by his elder surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1290/', "William John Bankes (1786&#150;1855)")</script>, who, like his younger son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1286/', "George Bankes (1787&#150;1856)")</script>, was also an MP. His third surviving son, Edward, became rector of Corfe Castle.<br>
