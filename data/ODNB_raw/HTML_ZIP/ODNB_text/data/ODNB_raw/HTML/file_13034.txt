<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry</span>, tenth earl of Pembroke and seventh earl of Montgomery  (1734&#150;1794), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 3 July 1734 at Pembroke House, Privy Garden, Whitehall, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13033/', "Henry Herbert, ninth earl of Pembroke and sixth earl of Montgomery (c.1689&#150;1750)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Fitzwilliam (1707&#150;1769), the daughter of Richard Fitzwilliam, fifth Viscount Fitzwilliam, and his wife, Frances Shelley. By 1743 he was boarding at a school in Wandsworth and by 1746 at Eton College, which he left after succeeding to his father's title in 1750. From late 1751 until December 1754 he travelled on the grand tour in France, Germany, Austria, and Italy.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1756 Pembroke married Lady Elizabeth Spencer (1737&#150;1831) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68361/', "Herbert, Elizabeth, countess of Pembroke and Montgomery")</script>], the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26118/', "Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough")</script>, and Elizabeth Trevor. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13026/', "George Augustus Herbert, Lord Herbert (later eleventh earl of Pembroke)")</script>, was born on 10 September 1759; they also had a daughter, Charlotte (1773&#150;1784). Pembroke first sat in the House of Lords on 13 November 1755. On 3 April 1756 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Wiltshire, where the family seat of Wilton House, near Salisbury, was situated. In November 1756 he became a lord of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales, a position he retained after the prince's accession as George III, but he resigned it in 1762 when he eloped abroad with Elizabeth Catherine (Kitty) Hunter (<i>d</i>. 1795), the daughter of Thomas Orby Hunter MP. Society was scandalized. The affair resulted in a son, Augustus Retnuh Reebkomp (1762&#150;1797), whose strange names reflected Hunter and Pembroke; later, as Augustus Montgomery, he became a captain in the Royal Navy. Lady Pembroke took her husband back in March 1763, although later in the marriage they lived much apart and he was often abroad. He had other affairs and certainly one illegitimate daughter. Pembroke's second, and final, appointment as lord of the bedchamber from 1769 to 1780 marked his restoration to favour. His unpredictable character remained. In 1784 his son Lord Herbert described him as &#145;perhaps &hellip; the most unaccountable of all human beings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pembroke Papers</span>, 2.260), while Horace Walpole was &#145;not surprised at any extravagance in his Lordship's morals&#146;  (Walpole, 25.497).<br>
<br>Since youth Pembroke had been, in his own words, &#145;horse mad&#146;  (Pembroke to Newcastle, 23 Sept 1754) and he had attended riding academies during his grand tour. Service in the cavalry ensued naturally, and he was appointed a cornet in the 1st King's dragoon guards on 12 October 1752. Two years later he became a captain, but in 1756 he transferred to the 1st foot guards. He was made aide-de-camp to George II on 8 May 1758; the rank of colonel followed. Having been appointed lieutenant-colonel in the newly raised 15th light dragoons on 10 March 1759, he joined them in July 1760 in Germany, where they formed part of the British contingent during the Seven Years' War. He left regimental service the same month to command a cavalry brigade. He was promoted major-general on 10 March 1761 and put on the staff in Germany. This was rapid advancement, even for a rich aristocrat. Pembroke was present at the battles of Warburg (31 July 1760) and Vellinghausen (15&#150;16 July 1761) and acquired a good reputation.<br>
<br>In 1761 Pembroke published <span class="italic">A Method of Breaking Horses, and Teaching Soldiers to Ride</span> (2nd edn 1762; 3rd and 4th edns 1778 and 1793 entitled <span class="italic">Military Equitation</span>). This influential book provided sensible and much-needed advice. The author emphasized the need for officers to superintend the management of horses, advocated riding with a natural seat, and opposed the docking of horses' tails. On 9 May 1764 he was appointed colonel of the 1st (Royal) Dragoons, a position he described as &#145;the most pleasant &amp; eligible object in the military of this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pembroke Papers</span>, 2.227), and which he retained until his death. Although seldom present with his regiment, he was a good example of the conscientious colonel, then common, who carefully attended to regimental efficiency. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 30 April 1770 and general on 20 November 1782. Other appointments were as colonel of the Wiltshire militia from 1770 to 1778 and governor of Portsmouth from June 1782.<br>
<br>In October 1778 Pembroke entertained George III and Queen Charlotte in splendour at Wilton, and in 1782 Lady Pembroke became a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte. Pembroke increasingly hated Lord North and his policies and voted on 8 February 1780 for a motion of inquiry into public expenditure and the granting of contracts. A consequence of opposition was deprivation of his lord lieutenancy; it was restored to him on 8 April 1782. His forthright ideas and argumentative character led to family quarrels over his son's army career and financial matters. He was devoted to horses, dogs, and beautiful women, enjoyed travelling and shooting, had some interest in music and the arts, rebuilt his London residence, Pembroke House, in 1754&#150;6, and was a lively correspondent. His portraits show a plumpish but not unpleasing face, with a prominent nose.<br>
<br>Pembroke died, after several months' illness, probably of a stroke, at Wilton on 26 January 1794 and was buried there on 3 February.<br>
