<span class="headword">Marvin,  Charles Thomas</span>  (1854&#150;1890), <span class="occ">writer on Russia</span>, was born on 10 June 1854 at Plumstead, Kent, the son of Charles Woodward Marvin, draughtsman, and his wife, Catherine Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Law. He was employed in a warehouse in Watling Street, London, in 1868. At the age of sixteen he went to Russia to join his father, who was assistant manager of an engineering works on the Neva. He remained there until 1875, and acquired a good knowledge of the language. For eighteen months he was the correspondent of <span class="italic">The Globe and Traveller</span> at St Petersburg. Returning to London in 1875 Marvin passed the civil service examination, and in January 1876 was appointed a temporary writer in the custom house. He was also transferred for a short time to the Inland Revenue department, and to the Post Office.<br>
<br>On 16 July 1877 Marvin entered the Foreign Office, and here, although only a writer, he was, on 29 May 1878, entrusted to make a copy of a secret treaty with Russia, the &#145;Project de memorandum&#146;. The same evening he supplied <span class="italic">The Globe and Traveller</span>, from memory, with a summary of the document. On 1 June Lord Salisbury, in the House of Lords, claimed that this summary was &#145;wholly unworthy of their lordships' confidence&#146;. On 14 June <span class="italic">The Globe and Traveller</span> printed the complete text of the treaty from Marvin's extremely retentive memory. On 26 June he was arrested, but discharged on 16 July as he had not committed an illegal act. In 1878 he published <span class="italic">Our public offices, embodying an account of the disclosure of the Anglo-Russian agreement, and the unrevealed secret treaty of 31 May, 1878</span>. During the Russo-Turkish War in 1878 he contributed to twenty publications. He married, on 5 June 1879, Mary Ann Georgina, daughter of George Woodward Marvin, captain in the Royal Horse Artillery.<br>
<br>Marvin published prolifically during the 1880s. In 1880 his first book on the Russo-Indian question, <span class="italic">The Eye-Witnesses' Account of the Disastrous Campaign Against the Akhal Tekke Turcomans</span>, appeared; it was adopted by the Russian government for military libraries, and commended by General Skobelev. In 1881 he printed <span class="italic">Merv the Queen of the World and the Scourge of the Man-Stealing Turcomans</span>, in which he predicted that the next Russian advance would be pushed to Panjdeh. In 1882 he was sent to Russia by Joseph Cowen, the radical politician and journalist, to interview the leading generals and statesmen on the Russo-Indian question. On his return he wrote <span class="italic">The Russian advance towards India: conversations with Skobeleff, Ignatieff, and other Russian generals and statesmen on the central Asian question</span>. The following year he travelled to the Caucasus, and published in 1884 an account of his exploration of the Russian oil-producing districts, under the title <span class="italic">The Region of the Eternal Fire</span>. The most popular of his works was, however, <span class="italic">The Russians at the Gates of Herat</span> (1885), a book of 200 pages, written and published within a week, which sold 65,000 copies.<br>
<br>Marvin died at Grosvenor House, Heavitree Road, Plumstead Common, Kent, on 4 December 1890, and was buried in Plumstead new cemetery on 10 December. His wife survived him.<br>
