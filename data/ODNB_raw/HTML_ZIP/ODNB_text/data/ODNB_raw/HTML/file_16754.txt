<span class="headword">Lisle, Lady  Alice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Alice Beconsawe]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1685), <span class="occ">supposed traitor</span>, was born at Moyles Court, Ellingham, Hampshire, the second daughter of Sir White Beconshaw 
    (or Beconsawe; <i>d</i>. 1638)
  , a local landowner and ship money sheriff for Hampshire. Her mother's identity is unknown. Alice was reared and educated in Hampshire. In 1636 she became the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16756/', "John Lisle (1609/10&#150;1664)")</script>, MP for Winchester in the Short and Long parliaments, and a regicide who was elevated to Cromwell's upper house in 1657. From that point until her death she was usually referred to as Lady Alice.<br>
<br>Little is known of Alice Lisle's roles as wife and mother. She was in exile with her husband at Lausanne in 1664 when two Irish royalists, Thomas MacDonnell and James Cotter, murdered him. John Lisle had fled to Switzerland after the Restoration with Edmund Ludlow and other regicides rather than stand trial in England. He was on his way to church when he was spotted and shot at such close range that all three bullets passed through his body and powder burns covered his clothing  (Marshall, 296). After her husband's burial in Lausanne, Alice returned to Moyles Court, on the outskirts of the New Forest, a property she had inherited from her father. She was a pious woman who sympathized with dissenters but was not an active sectarian  (Bruce, 124). For the next twenty years, her peaceful Hampshire lifestyle was interrupted only by occasional trips to London. She had three children: a son, William, a royalist, who married Lady Katherine Hyde; and two daughters, Triphena Lloyd and Bridget Usher. Both daughters married twice: nothing is known of Triphena's husbands; however, Bridget married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13380/', "Leonard Hoar")</script>, president of Harvard University, and after his death wed Hezekiah Usher of Boston.<br>
<br>Alice Lisle's quiet life ended abruptly with Monmouth's rebellion. On 25 July 1685 James Dunne, a nonconformist baker from Warminster, came to Moyles Court bearing a note from John Hickes, who was seeking shelter for himself and Richard Nelthorp. Dunne had been hiding the fugitives since the battle of Sedgemoor and seems to have been part of a network of dissenters across the region. Lisle knew Hickes as a presbyterian minister and readily consented to his plea for sanctuary. Hickes and Nelthorp dined with her, then hid in the malt house. Alerted by John Barter, a local labourer, that rebels had taken refuge at Moyles Court, Colonel Thomas Penruddock and his men searched the property and arrested Hickes and Nelthorp on the morning of the 26th. Lady Alice was also taken into custody, transferred to Winchester, and charged with treason for harbouring Hickes.<br>
<br>Brought before a special commission at Winchester on 27 August 1685, Lady Alice was the first person tried before Lord Chief Justice George Jeffreys in what was subsequently labelled the &#145;bloody assizes&#146;. To drive home the serious consequences of harbouring fugitives, the government clearly wished to make an example of her  (Earle, 169&#150;71). Aged, infirm, and nearly deaf, she asked that a friend, Matthew Brown, be designated to stand by her in court and repeat all that was said to her. Throughout the ordeal she proclaimed her innocence. A version of the trial record survives  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 11.298&#150;382); however, according to Muddiman, its veracity is open to question. First printed in 1719, long after all who could check the transcript for accuracy were deceased, the proceedings seem to have been prepared from trial notes  (Muddiman, 27&#150;8). What makes the document suspect is the vitriolic language and court demeanour attributed to Jeffreys. Its excessiveness differs from any other extant trial record involving the chief justice  (Keeton, 314).<br>
<br>The case against Alice Lisle hinged on proving that she knew Hickes and Nelthorp were fugitive rebels. As the trial progressed, with Jeffreys apparently badgering witnesses sympathetic to Alice Lisle, Dunne, the key witness, found his testimony contradicted by Barter. Under blistering examination, and fearing that he might also be charged, he recanted and implicated her. Lady Lisle acknowledged hiding Hickes but steadfastly rejected the charge of treason. Replying directly to Jeffreys, she stated, &#145;And I beseech your lordship to believe I had no intention to harbour him but as a Nonconformist; and that, I knew, was no treason&#146;  (Bruce, 136). Because of her age and deafness, Alice Lisle proved no match for her determined accuser. After a gruelling six-hour trial, she was convicted and condemned by a reluctant jury to be burned alive. According to Jeffreys, &#145;I would have condemned her had she been my mother&#146;  (Chenevix Trench, 237). Her appeal to King James for clemency modified the sentence only slightly, and she was beheaded in the Market Square, Winchester, on 2 September 1685. In her dying speech, she reiterated that her only crime was &#145;Entertaining a Non-Conformist Minister&#146;  (&#145;Last Speech&#146;). The body was returned to her family for burial at Ellingham, and her small estate was transferred to Louis Duras, second earl of Feversham. Her attainder was reversed in 1689 after a petition from her daughters.<br>
<br>Popular opinion overwhelmingly supported Alice Lisle, portraying her as a protestant martyr, a victim of royal vindictiveness. Many were shocked that a woman of her age and social standing should be executed, while others, more fully implicated in the actual rising, received lesser sentences or pardons. Only one contemporary elegy suggested her guilt and sanctioned the punishment. Penning her epitaph, its misogynist author wrote:<blockquote>
<div>Here Lies Madam Lisle Dead,<br>
</div>
<div>Which for Treason lost her Head,<br>
</div>
<div>She Patroniz'd the Cause, The Cause,<br>
</div>
<div>Against the Church and stablish'd Laws,<br>
</div>
<div>Let all her sex both Great and small,<br>
</div>
<div>Take here Example by her Fall,<br>
</div>
<div>And henceforth ever shun to be<br>
</div>
<div>Entangled by Presbi ery.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Elegy on Mrs. Alicia Lisle</span>)</blockquote>While Jeffreys was probably technically correct in his decision, the excessive sentence cast a pall over the remaining trials and lent credence to the charge that she was the victim of judicial murder.<br>
