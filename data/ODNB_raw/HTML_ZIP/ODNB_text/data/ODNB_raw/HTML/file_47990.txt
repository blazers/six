<span class="headword">Curr,  John</span>  (1756&#150;1823), <span class="occ">coal viewer and engineer</span>, was born at Kyo, near Lanchester, co. Durham, the third and youngest son of John Curr (1712&#150;1777), a coal viewer, or mining engineer, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1722). As a child he was familiar with the Durham coalfield at Bushblades where his father worked as a coal viewer to the Silvertops, a landed Roman Catholic family. Curr developed an interest in mining and engineering, encouraged by his father who &#145;brought up his son&#146; to be &#145;a civil engineer&#146;  (E. M. Curr, &#145;Memoranda&#146;). The son of Catholic parents, Curr was raised and remained within the faith throughout his life. The family's religion almost certainly influenced the employment of Curr's father by the Silvertops and was a likely factor in the decision of the Catholic Charles Howard, earl of Surrey, later eleventh duke of Norfolk, to employ Curr as coal viewer at his Sheffield collieries&#151;a position he most probably took up in 1777.<br>
<br>At Sheffield Curr was &#145;faced with a financially bankrupt and technologically backward concern&#146; which he set about investigating with another viewer, John Stephenson of Kimberworth Park colliery in Rotherham  (Medlicott, &#145;John Curr and the development of the Sheffield collieries&#146;, 52). From the outset it was clear that the cost of extraction far outstripped profit. Faced with these problems the lessees of the collieries surrendered their lease on lady day 1781 and the mines reverted to the direct control of the earl of Surrey who in that year promoted Curr &#145;Superintendent of the coal works&#146;  (ibid.). On 1 May 1781, at St Peter's Church, Sheffield, Curr married Hannah Wilson (1759&#150;1851); the couple lived at Bellevue House, Sheffield Park, and had three sons and six daughters, all of whom were brought up in the Roman Catholic faith. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52436/', "Edward Curr")</script>, left England in 1820 and became a noted politician and entrepreneur in Australia.<br>
<br>With considerable financial backing from the earl of Surrey, John Curr worked with great imagination to overcome the shortcomings of the Sheffield collieries. His first invention was the flanged cast-iron railway&#151;described as &#145;plate ways&#146; or &#145;railroads&#146;&#151;which were the first flanged iron rails installed underground for the hauling of coal. The date of their introduction has been contested, not least because of conflicting statements made by Curr himself, though they were probably first adopted in Sheffield in 1787. Prior to this invention, coal had been hauled underground either in wooden sledges or in wheeled corves along wooden rails. Curr's use of iron rails dramatically improved the hurrying of coal by reducing the number of horses needed to pull the corves, and by enabling an additional 2000 corves to be moved annually&#151;realizing an estimated annual saving of some &pound;312, 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.  (Buddle, &#145;Report&#146;, 7 April 1787, Sheff. Arch., Arundel Castle MSS, ACM/S/223, fols. 3&#150;5). In addition to the iron rails Curr introduced a new four-wheeled corf with a capacity five times greater than those previously used at the Sheffield site. Though the iron tracks were flanged, the corf's wheels were flat and could run with or without rails above ground. Curr's invention provided considerable gains in productivity&#151;enabling the extraction of coal at greater distances from the shaft bottom, and so reducing the need to sink new pits to work deeper seams. From 1787 Curr also experimented at Sheffield with new designs to move coal via an underground canal connecting railroads from different pits. The scheme was approved by the mining engineer John Buddle (1743&#150;1806) as &#145;peculiarly favourable&#146;, though it does not appear to have been realized  (ibid., fols. 8&#150;11). Reaction to Curr's underground railroads was mixed. While his intention was for the rails to be used with pit ponies, the new method of haulage was so effective that it encouraged cheaper child labour in place of animals and adult putters. Concern at possible changes in working practices initially led many colliers to oppose Curr's invention. However, as his schemes became better known he was complimented for easing the colliers' lot; in a poem of 1843 he was praised &#145;wi' peace and plenty&#146; for &#145;furst invent[ing] metal plates&#146;  (T. Wilson, <span class="italic">The Pitman's Pay and Other Poems</span>, 1843, 32).<br>
<br>At Sheffield Curr also sought to improve the efficiency of the steam engine, and discovered that raising the cistern higher above the cylinder produced a stronger vacuum without additional fuel. For these experiments he became an acknowledged expert in the construction of atmospheric steam engines and was regarded as a successor to John Smeaton. In 1797 he published plans and descriptions of his modified Newcomen steam engines, with detailed comparisons between the power of different types of boiler. In the previous decade Curr had also made advances in winding technology, patenting designs for an &#145;entirely new &hellip; scheme of drawing two corves abreast, at one time, up a pit &hellip; by means of sliding conductors&#146;&#151;or vertical iron guide-rails&#151;along with a new mode of &#145;landing&#146; and tipping the coal  (patent no. 1660, 1778). By 1801 the scheme was &#145;practised by a great number of Collieries&#146;  (Curr, &#145;Report&#146;, 23 Oct 1801, Sheff. Arch., Arundel Castle MSS, ACM/S/214, fols. 1&#150;2). However, it was to the manufacture and use of rope that Curr gave his closest attention, with nine patents between 1792 and 1813. He began with a design for &#145;double Rope&#146;, which afforded considerable savings by lifting &#145;more than double the weight of coals&#146;, and followed this in 1798 with a new &#145;Flat Rope&#146; that solved the problem of corves rotating when lifted up the shaft  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Growing demand for his inventions led Curr to become a major stakeholder in the Queen's Foundry, Sheffield, and to establish another iron foundry and rope walk at Sheffield Park in 1792. From here he supplied the duke of Norfolk's collieries and other mines in the Yorkshire coalfield as their owners adopted his schemes. Rails were introduced at Middleton Colliery, Leeds, in 1790 and from this year he was also employed by the once Catholic landowner Sir Thomas Gascoigne to introduce his &#145;patent schemes&#146; at Garforth and Parlington collieries in the West Riding. By the time he left Gascoigne's employment in 1801 Curr estimated &#145;that about 16 Collieries out of 20&#146; had introduced his railroads &#145;in the County's of York, Lancaster, Salop, Derby, Stafford, Warwick, and great parts of Wales, and is now adopting near London, and in the Neighbourhood of Newcastle upon Tyne&#146;  (Curr, &#145;Report&#146;, 23 Oct 1801, Sheff. Arch., Arundel Castle MSS, ACM/S/214, fol. 1). Take up of the railroads owed much to the ironmaster and civil engineer Benjamin Outram who copied and developed Curr's unpatented rails, installing them in a range of industrial concerns from 1793. Though originally designed for underground haulage, it was in surface transport that Curr's rails attracted most interest. In 1793 he advised the Coalbrookdale Company in Shropshire on haulage equipment and the possibility of using his rails to improve communications between the ironworks and the Shropshire canal. The Peak Forest tramway, Derbyshire (1796), the Merthyr tram road, Glamorgan (1802), and the Surrey Iron Railway (1803)&#151;the first public railway, which ran between Croydon and Wandsworth&#151;also adopted Curr's rails above ground.<br>
<br>In 1797 Curr published <span class="italic">The Coal Viewer and Engine Builder's Practical Companion</span> which he dedicated to his patron, Charles Howard, now eleventh duke of Norfolk. An early engineering textbook, it remains a key source on Curr's inventions with meticulously detailed plans and instructions for carpenters, blacksmiths, and founders on how to construct and repair his rails, corves, winding gear, and steam engines. A section devoted to flanged railroads is the earliest published engineering work on railway track and contains &#145;the most elaborate description of a Newcomen pumping engine at the highest state of development&#146;  (Day and McNeil, 184).<br>
<br>By 1800, and not withstanding Curr's innovations, the Sheffield collieries were again operating at a loss. In October of the following year he was dismissed by Norfolk. Curr vigorously protested the duke's decision, outlining all his work and &#145;reasons why the collieries of late years have been unproductive&#146;  (Curr, &#145;Report&#146;, 23 October 1801, Sheff. Arch., Arundel Castle MSS, ACM/S/214). These protests came to nothing for, while a highly proficient mining engineer, Curr's abilities as a manager were limited. Faced with rising costs and falling profits from 1791, he had failed to balance capital investment with financial return, focusing too much on the experimentation and implementation of his new technologies. This said, Curr's inventions significantly extended the working lives and productivity of the mines in Sheffield and other parts of the county. As Curr informed the duke: &#145;bad as the Collieries have lately proved, they would have been worse if I had not made the improvements I have&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following his dismissal, Curr promoted his innovations nationwide. He maintained a close working relationship with the duke of Norfolk from whom he leased agricultural land, and continued to supply the duke's collieries with goods from his rope walk and foundry. From 1814 he developed a major interest in a Norwich iron foundry that produced paddle boat steam engines, and advised his close friend, the mining engineer John Buddle the younger&#151;who was interested in buying the Tyne steam packet&#151;on boat engine designs  (&#145;John Curr Norwich Iron Foundry&#146;, Durham RO, John Buddle MSS, NCB I/JB, 370&#150;73). Curr ceased rope making in 1818 and two years later he sold Bellevue House and moved with his wife to Paris, where he resided for upwards of eighteen months before their return to Sheffield. A prominent member of Sheffield's Catholic community, he was instrumental in establishing the church of St Marie. In the months prior to his death he lost &pound;30,000 which he had invested in &#145;some mercantile bubble&#146; on the advice of a French priest  (E. M. Curr, &#145;Memoranda&#146;). He died in Sheffield, aged sixty-seven, on 27 January 1823 and was buried at St Marie's. He was survived by his wife who died on 10 June 1851 and was buried at the Bar Convent, York.<br>
