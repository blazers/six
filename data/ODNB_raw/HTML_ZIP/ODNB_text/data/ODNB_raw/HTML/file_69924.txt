<span class="headword">Stewart,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Arran  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1595?), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26491/', "John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl (d. 1579)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1557), daughter of George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly. Her first husband, Hugh Fraser, fifth Lord Lovat, died in 1577 leaving her with six children, and on 6 December 1578 Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70056/', "Robert Stewart, earl of Lennox and later earl of March (1522/3&#150;1586)")</script>, former bishop of Caithness, who was in his fifties, and was dismissed by contemporaries as &#145;simple and of lyttle action or account&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 5.355). Young, beautiful, and passionate, Elizabeth soon found him unsatisfactory, had the marriage annulled on 19 May 1581 on the grounds of his impotence, and on 6 July 1581 married her charismatic and ruthless lover, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26481/', "James Stewart (d. 1596)")</script>, who on 22 April had been created earl of Arran.<br>
<br>For several years Arran, along with Esm&eacute; Stewart, earl of Lennox, virtually ruled the country, while Elizabeth reigned supreme as principal lady at court, infuriating everyone with her coarse, high-handed manner. Her husband acquired a multiplicity of honours and offices, but although he and his wife profited from the complicated political feuding of James VI's minority, in so doing they both attracted bitter hatred. According to gossip, Elizabeth pawned one of the crown jewels and sat beside the judges in the court of session so that she could pervert the course of justice for her own financial gain. In February 1585 she was maliciously rumoured to have been made comptroller, and she was even said to have had dealings with witches, and to have boasted of their prophecy that she would be the greatest woman in Scotland, while her husband would &#145;have the highest head in that kingdom&#146;  (Fergusson, 73&#150;4, 59).<br>
<br>When Arran fell from power and lost his earldom in 1585, the couple retired to Elizabeth's jointure lands in Inverness-shire, where they rode, hunted, and plotted their return. They had at least three sons and a daughter. According to one report, Elizabeth died in childbirth in 1590, but the Lovat chronicler claimed that the witches' prophecy that she would be the &#145;greatest&#146; woman in Scotland was hideously fulfilled when she died &#145;all swelled in an extraordinary manner&#146; from dropsy in 1595  (Fergusson, 74). Arran was murdered later that year. Elizabeth had been known to the church ministers as Lady Jezebel, and one modern historian has suggested that Arran and she were the inspiration for Shakespeare's Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It is, however, difficult to say how much of her lurid reputation was caused by her own personality, and how much was attributable to the envy of her many enemies.<br>
