<span class="headword">Pellew, Sir  Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds</span>  (1789&#150;1861), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21808/', "Edward Pellew, first Viscount Exmouth (1757&#150;1833)")</script>, and his wife, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frowde (1756&#150;1837), was born on 13 December 1789. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21810/', "George Pellew")</script>, Church of England priest, was his brother. In March 1799 he was entered on board the <i>Imp&eacute;tueux</i>, then commanded by his father, with whom he was afterwards in the <i>Tonnant</i>, and in 1805 in the <i>Culloden</i> on the East India station. On 8 September 1805 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Sceptre</i>, but, returning shortly afterwards to the <i>Culloden</i>, was successively appointed by his father to the command of the sloop <i>Rattlesnake</i>, and the frigates <i>Terpsichore</i> and <i>Psyche</i>, in which he was repeatedly engaged with Dutch vessels and Malay pirates. On 12 October 1807 he was confirmed in the rank of commander, but was meanwhile appointed by his father acting captain of the <i>Powerful</i> (74 guns) and, in the following year, of the <i>Cornwallis</i> (50 guns), and then of the <i>Phaeton</i> (38 guns). His commission as captain was confirmed on 14 October 1808, and, continuing in the <i>Phaeton</i>, he took part in the capture of Mauritius in 1810 and of Java in 1811. In August 1812 the <i>Phaeton</i> returned to England with a large convoy of Indiamen. Pellew received the thanks of the East India Company and a present of five hundred guineas.<br>
<br>Pellew then went out to the Mediterranean in the <i>Iphigenia</i> (36 guns), and from her was moved, in January 1813, to the <i>Resistance</i> (46 guns). In October she was part of a strong squadron which silenced the batteries at Port d'Anzo and captured a convoy of twenty-nine vessels that had taken refuge there. In February 1814 the <i>Resistance</i> was ordered home and paid off, apparently because of a mutiny, for which several men were condemned to death, and several to be flogged. The sentence was, however, quashed, on account of a technical error in the proceedings; and, though it did not appear officially, it was said that the men had been goaded to mutiny by Pellew's harshness. In June 1814 he was nominated a CB. In 1816 he married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1849), only daughter of Sir Godfrey Webster, bt, and they had one daughter. From August 1818 to June 1822 he had command of the <i>R&eacute;volutionnaire</i> (46 guns), after which he was on half pay for thirty years.<br>
<br>In January 1836 the king made Pellew a KCH, and knighted him. On 9 November 1846 he was promoted rear-admiral. In 1851 he married C&eacute;cile (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of Edward Drummond, count of Melfort, but was divorced from her in 1859. In December 1852 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the East Indies and China station, not without a strong expression of public opinion on the misguidedness of sending out a man of his age to conduct what might be a troublesome war in the pestilent climate of Burma. In April 1853 he hoisted his flag on board the <i>Winchester</i>, which returned to Hong Kong in the following September, when the men applied for leave. The question of leave there was then difficult, because of the heat, the poisonous spirits sold, and the filthy condition of the town. Pellew decided that the men should not have leave, at least until the weather was cooler; but he did not inform them of the reason. There was a mutinous expression of feeling; Pellew ordered the drum to beat to quarters, and as the men did not obey, the officers, with drawn swords, were sent to force them up. Some three or four were wounded, and the mutiny was quelled. On the news reaching England, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in strong leading articles, pointed out the coincidence of mutinies on the <i>Winchester</i> and the <i>Resistance</i> within a short time of Pellew's assuming the command, and demanded his immediate recall. Even without this pressure, the Admiralty had decided that he had shown a lamentable want of judgement, and summarily recalled him. He had attained the rank of vice-admiral on 22 April 1853, and became admiral on 13 February 1858, but had no further service, and died at Marseilles on 28 July 1861. He was buried in the protestant cemetery, Florence which was also the burial place of his first wife.<br>
<br>Pellew's career was made by his father, who exploited death vacancies and the impracticability of communicating with the Admiralty to promote him captain when he was only nineteen. This seems to have warped his character. Pellew was, like his father, a brave and resourceful seaman, but a harsh, overbearing, and insensitive disciplinarian. The two mutinies that defined his career were the result of his zeal, and his failure to take the men into his confidence. His selection for a command in 1852 reflected the scarcity of senior officers of suitable political persuasion, and was always regarded as doubtful, even by those who made it. A favourite of William IV, who shared many of his values, Pellew married for money, and possessed the independent means to survive his long years ashore in some style.<br>
