<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lamb,  William</span>, second Viscount Melbourne  (1779&#150;1848), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born in London on 15 March 1779 at Melbourne House, Piccadilly (later divided into the apartments known as the Albany), in law the second child of Peniston Lamb (1745&#150;1828), a substantial landowner in Derbyshire and Hertfordshire, for many years an MP of no distinction, and from 1770 an Irish peer as first Baron Melbourne (Viscount Melbourne from 1781). His mother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47307/', "Elizabeth Lamb, n&#233;e Milbanke (bap. 1751, d. 1818)")</script>, only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, bt, of Halnaby, Yorkshire, but owing to the desuetude of her marriage his true father was widely held to be anyone but Lord Melbourne; contemporary suspicion rested on the fabulous aesthete Lord Egremont [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30141/', "Wyndham, George O'Brien, third earl of Egremont")</script>]. Only the eldest son, Peniston, had a sound claim to legitimacy; there followed after William two brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15914/', "Frederick (Fred) James Lamb (later first Baron Beauvale)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15915/', "George Lamb")</script> (MP for Westminster), and two sisters, Emily, successively Lady Cowper and Lady Palmerston [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40959/', "Temple, Emily")</script>], and the short-lived Harriet.<br>
<br>Lamb was born into a family of no great fame or antiquity, but into a social circle of high-pitched wit, wealth, and rather febrile emotion. His father was coarse and neglectful and hugged the background, often in retreat at Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. Lady Melbourne, in contrast, was a jewel of high whig society, admired for her hospitality at Melbourne House, her great charm, and forcefulness of character. Beneath the surface of verve and cheerful self-confidence, however, lay a current of hardness and sadness, derived perhaps from the personal sacrifices that had been necessary to make her way in society without the aid of her husband. She worked hard to cultivate and promote her sons. Already in 1785 the little Lambs were well publicized by Reynolds's portrait of Peniston, William, and Fred, engraved as <span class="italic">The Affectionate Brothers</span>. Peniston was an early disappointment to Lady Melbourne, taking after his father and inclining to sensual pleasures and the turf, so her hopes rested increasingly on William. He was entered at Eton College in November 1788, a spoilt and bookish child, in love with his mama and with Shakespeare. Yet a certain poise was already evident and he escaped the worse bullying to become a social success. At Trinity College, Cambridge, where he arrived in October 1796, he ran with the fastest crowd, but to his mother's delight showed more real enthusiasm for Rousseau and poetry than for fools and horses. His prize declamation, &#145;The progressive improvements of mankind&#146;, attracted Charles James Fox's attention and was commended by him in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>After taking his degree in July 1799, Lamb was sent with his brother Fred to Scotland to study for a few terms with the Glasgow <i>lumi&egrave;re</i> John Millar. This course of treatment did not have the desired effect, in that Lamb's intellectual development never leaned towards the kind of social, political, and metaphysical speculation for which the Scottish Enlightenment was famed; he preferred the classics, history, literature, and religious speculation only at a distance (Tudor and Stuart controversies were a favourite). He found Millar's Francophilia to be slightly ridiculous and, in the political circumstances of the time, even dangerous. He began to question some of his inherited whig opinions.<h2>
<a name="Thewhig18001815"></a>The whig, 1800&#150;1815</h2>Yet on entering &#145;the World&#146; after his return from Scotland, Lamb quickly became a darling of whig society. Physically he presented a commanding figure, tall and conventionally good-looking, with masses of curling hair and dark, beetling brows. His wide reading and keen perception made him a brilliant conversationalist, especially popular with the ladies of the Devonshire House set. Unusually in the fast crowd with which he still ran, he abstained from the crudest sexual importuning and preferred the pleasures of flirtation and gourmandizing. His mother's only anxiety was for his growing tendency to inactivity and introspection.<br>
<br>This tendency she was not able to halt by finding Lamb profitable occupation. He had been entered at Lincoln's Inn in July 1797, so as to keep his terms concurrently with Cambridge, but was called to the bar only at Michaelmas 1804. After a single brief on the northern circuit the death of his elder brother, Peniston, on 24 January 1805 required him to consider an occupation better suited to a future peer. With glee Lady Melbourne prepared for him a glorious career in politics. He joined Brooks's Club in April with Fox as his sponsor, and in January 1806 was brought into parliament for Leominster in the place of his friend Arthur Kinnaird. Too much the d&eacute;butant to win a place in the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;, he was nevertheless asked by Lord Howick to move the address in December 1806; it was his maiden speech. His whig patrons moved him to the Haddington burghs in the election of 1806 and to Portarlington in 1807. Thereafter he remained a promising young man for several years, making occasionally effective interventions in debate but displaying little zeal or talent for oratory. Both his indecisiveness and his political scepticism were showing. He had little taste for the rhetorical excesses of opposition and, though he generally voted with the whigs because he found loyalty the easiest option, at heart he shared ministers' anxieties about outdoor agitation and their desire to prosecute war with Napoleon to the utmost.<br>
<br>Lamb's political difficulties were compounded in these years by romantic difficulties of a spectacular kind. His marriage on 3 June 1805 to Lady Caroline Ponsonby (1785&#150;1828) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15911/', "Lamb, Lady Caroline")</script>], daughter of his Devonshire House friend Lady Bessborough, had only exacerbated his latent psychological conflicts. The two were never able to establish a normal family life. After a miscarriage in January 1806, in August 1807 Caroline bore a son, Augustus, who was prone to convulsions and developmentally retarded, and then a daughter in January 1809 who died after a few days. No further pregnancies ensued, but subsequently a number of shadowy &#145;adopted&#146; children appeared for brief periods in the Lambs' household. Even had these efforts to rear a family not proved abortive, William and Caroline might not have made a happy couple. His firmness and confidence were too superficial to provide the constant attention and discipline that her flights of fancy, even lunacy, seemed to require. Within a few years of marriage she had launched into a series of public liaisons, most disastrously with the poet Lord Byron in 1812&#150;13. Byron's repudiation of her led to a theatrical suicide attempt at Lady Heathcote's ball in July 1813, after which her grip on sanity, never firm, loosened progressively. Posterity remains divided in assigning the blame for this disaster: William's indecisiveness, Caroline's erratic behaviour, the Lamb family's hostility, and Byron's callousness all played a role. But certainly William's inability to grapple with Caroline's problems led to the long, drawn-out d&eacute;nouement; no formal separation was arranged until 1825, after which date Caroline lived alone at the Lamb country houses, Brocket and Melbourne.<br>
<br>It seems reasonable to see Lamb's private disappointments as contributing to his deepening political disappointments, that is, both his failure to shine as a House of Commons man and his disillusionment with whig idealism. Always prone to scepticism and detachment, he was now more than ever reluctant to commit himself to great causes or to reveal what deep feelings he did hold. During Perceval's ministry he showed signs of supporting Canning's line in foreign policy and the conduct of the Peninsular campaign, but he declined disdainfully the minor office offered to him by Perceval in early 1812. He seemed hardly bothered by the loss of his seat at the general election of that year, a sentiment shared by Brougham, who regarded him as little short of a tory.<h2>
<a name="TheCanningite18151830"></a>The Canningite, 1815&#150;1830</h2>Lamb did not think much of Canning personally but he was drawn inexorably to his centrist politics, without either whig rhetoric or tory bigotry. Social considerations made it easier for him to distance himself from the whigs. Lamb had become friendly with J. W. Ward, and he admired greatly William Huskisson; by 1816 his beloved sister, Emily, though married to Lord Cowper, had become the acknowledged lover of the Canningite Lord Palmerston. The death of Lady Melbourne in 1818 removed another obstacle. Consequently when he returned to parliament in April 1816, brought in for Peterborough by Lord Fitzwilliam, he insisted on taking an independent line, reaffirming to Lord Holland his commitment to the whig principles of 1688 but not to &#145;a heap of modern additions, interpolations, facts and fictions&#146;  (Ziegler, 70). He spoke against parliamentary reform and for a firm response to domestic sedition, serving on the secret committee to consider civil disorder in February 1817 and voting subsequently to suspend habeas corpus. He took equivocal positions on Peterloo and the Queen Caroline affair.<br>
<br>And yet the role of hanger-on to a centrist leader-in-waiting was hardly one to set the political juices flowing. In 1819 Lamb accepted a more dignified constituency, the county of Hertfordshire, but did little with it, and when faced with whig opposition at the 1826 election he simply withdrew. Thus when Canning's moment finally arrived, upon Lord Liverpool's death in April 1827, Lamb had to be found a ministerial borough&#151;briefly Newport, then Bletchingley&#151;in order to qualify for office. That office was the pivotal chief secretaryship of Ireland, which he won not by dint of administrative merit or knowledge of Ireland but because his whig connections and known sympathies for the Catholic claims secured for Canning crucial whig votes.<br>
<br>Lamb was surprisingly successful as chief secretary, an office he continued to hold after Canning's death in the Goderich and Wellington ministries. He found some resolution to his political contradictions in a style that was superficially liberal and tolerant, and particularly alive to the importance of symbolic nuance in influencing public opinion, but was scornful of legislative reforms and favoured a strong, deflating, disciplinary response to extra-parliamentary agitation. He supported Catholic emancipation without believing it would improve the condition of the Irish people one whit, and he won popularity among Catholic eminences by appearing sympathetic and open-minded without pursuing any particular line of reform.<br>
<br>Fortuitously, Lamb found a similar resolution in his private life. Liberated by his separation from Caroline, he embarked on a liaison with the Dublin hostess Elizabeth La Touche, Lady Branden, in the autumn of 1827, probably a sexual attachment, certainly a deeply affectionate one that persisted at a distance after his departure from Dublin in 1828. Less demanding than Caroline, Lady Branden could appeal in moderation to both sides of Lamb's character&#151;his pose of cool detachment and his well of feeling. As Philip Ziegler's biography reveals, a game of male chastisement of female misbehaviour featured in their correspondence. This relationship was not much affected by Lamb's citation as co-respondent in Lord Branden's divorce suit of May 1828, which was dismissed for lack of evidence after Lamb paid Branden off.<br>
<br>Despite his personal opposition to parliamentary reform, Lamb resigned from office with his fellow Huskissonites in May 1828 over the disposition of East Retford's disfranchised seats. Huskisson's inheritance of the moderate leadership from Canning had helped to cement Lamb's loyalties there, as had Emily's unfolding role as a Huskissonite hostess at Panshanger, near Lamb's country house at Brocket in Hertfordshire. Particularly after Caroline's death in January 1828 made Brocket once more safe to approach, Lamb spent more and more of his time there and at Panshanger. His father's death in July 1828 also cleared the occupancy of Melbourne Hall, and further freed him from House of Commons responsibilities, as Lamb inherited the English peerage his father had added to his Irish titles in 1815. Henceforward he was known as Viscount Melbourne and sat in the Lords. As such, the vicissitudes of politics would catapult him into an unlikely role as a leader not only of the whig party but of whig government.<h2>
<a name="Homesecretary18301834"></a>Home secretary, 1830&#150;1834</h2>The Canningites were again in a powerful position when, after the 1830 general election and Wellington's resignation in November, they provided the key votes in the construction of a whig majority. Melbourne was one of the &#145;three viscounts&#146; of the Canning party&#151;the others were Palmerston and Goderich&#151;who monopolized the secretaryships of state in Lord Grey's new government. Huskisson's sudden death in a railway accident thrust Palmerston into a position of leadership, and he secured for himself the Foreign Office and for his lover's brother the Home Office. This latter appointment surprised many people and shocked many whigs, who did not rate either Melbourne's administrative abilities or his party fidelity. Yet again Melbourne confounded the doubters. As with his Irish appointment, Melbourne's combination of superficial sympathy and firm disciplinary handling proved useful to a precarious reforming government seeking both to flatter public opinion and to reassure the forces of order by a firm administration of the law.<br>
<br>Melbourne took little interest in the great parliamentary business of the Grey government. Never a principled believer in parliamentary reform, he accepted the argument that it was necessary to restore popular confidence in government and even acted as some slight restraint on Palmerston's efforts to dilute the government's bill. He spoke only briefly in the Lords' debates on the measures. In social reforms that might be thought to come within the Home Office's ambit, he took little more part. He sat on the cabinet committee that framed the new poor law but hardly contributed to its deliberations. That business, as well as legislation to limit the hours of factory labour, he left to Althorp, Brougham, and teams of commissioners nominally working under his supervision. He did not care even to hear about the living and working conditions of the poor, believing them to be part of the natural order of things and certainly irremediable by legislation. &#145;The whole duty of government&#146;, he pronounced, &#145;is to prevent and punish crime, and to preserve contracts&#146;  (Cecil, 305). But he accepted with equanimity his colleagues' assurances that positive legislation was necessary to secure the acquiescence of the governed.<br>
<br>Against breaches of the law, however, Melbourne acted both vigorously and sensitively, and it was for this function that his reforming brethren thanked him heartily. In dealing with the Swing riots of 1830&#150;31 he checked tory magistrates' alarmism and was reluctant to resort to the army or even the yeomanry, but urged magistrates to use fully their ordinary powers, augmented by special constables and large bounties on the arrest of rioters and incendiaries. He appointed a special commission to try about a thousand of those arrested, but ensured that strict justice was adhered to&#151;a third of those tried were acquitted, and although a fifth were sentenced to death most of the sentences were commuted to transportation. The same balancing act was carried off in dealing with the reform disturbances of 1831&#150;2. Melbourne rebuffed calls for extraordinary measures, such as the extensive employment of spies, but used existing powers of prosecution and regulated assemblies rigorously.<br>
<br>Melbourne's antipathy to new legislation did not wholly apply to questions of public order. He considered various ways of systematically improving police and punishment. One of his first acts in office was to appoint the political economist Nassau Senior to inquire into the legality of industrial combinations, but in the end he rejected Senior's recommendation for a more severe repression of such combinations. Trade unions, he felt, were unreasonable and absurd, contrary to the law of nature but not susceptible to the law of humans. He told manufacturers that &#145;the Government would repress violence and punish crime&#146;, but that as for combinations, &#145;nothing will open the eyes of the working people, but the blowing out of forges, the stopping of mills, and the leaving the men &hellip; to indigence and beggary&#146;  (UCL, Brougham MSS 43498). However, in one famous case&#151;that of the &#145;Dorchester labourers&#146;, or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69736/', "Tolpuddle Martyrs")</script>&#151;he did not entirely follow his own advice. He allowed tory magistrates to prosecute six agricultural trade unionists to such an extent as to arouse a massive protest movement, and left it to his successor, Lord John Russell, to calm the waters by commuting sentences. More positively, Melbourne devised in 1832 a bill that would have extended London's system of a stipendiary magistracy and police force to the provinces. Although this bill was never introduced&#151;it was overshadowed first by the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> and later by poor-law reform&#151;it shows that Melbourne was willing and able to grasp the nettle of administrative reform where matters close to his heart were touched.<br>
<br>Melbourne did not always win the credit he deserved for his firm hand on the helm. In September 1831 Grey sought to replace him on grounds of indolence. Holland successfully parried the accusation, maintaining that &#145;a dislike to meddling legislation and his careless nonchalant Manner might give him the character of an indolent man with the inobservant, but those who had business with the office did not find him so&#146;  (H. R. V. Holland, <span class="italic">The Holland House Diaries, 1831&#150;1840</span>, ed A. D. Kriegel, 1977, 48). Melbourne had only himself to blame for such scrapes. The lazy manner he had devised to indulge his sense of fun and at the same time disguise his vulnerabilities was ill suited to a senior statesman. He received deputations with every appearance of cool carelessness. He surrounded himself with like-minded cronies, notably his brother George (who served as under-secretary at the Home Office until his death in early 1834) and his private secretary, Tom Young, sometime purser on the duke of Devonshire's yacht. In cabinet and in society he pretended to know and care far less than he did. These traits grew more pronounced as he aged. What had in his youth been viewed as stylish insouciance now came to appear more eccentric. Strangers could be alarmed by his habits: barking out imprecations, rubbing his hands gleefully at some private joke, audibly muttering to himself while by-standing in the Lords, occasionally weeping silently when mysteriously touched by some happenstance.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Melbourne had by this stage achieved a happiness that had escaped him earlier. He had won the prominence that he had always felt to be his desert. He no longer allowed himself to be hurt or spurned or disappointed. And in 1831 he found a substitute for Lady Branden in Caroline Norton (1808&#150;1877), granddaughter of his hero Sheridan and wife of an abusive husband. This relationship followed roughly the pattern of its predecessor; it is less likely to have been sexual, but it provided Melbourne with the same emotional reassurance, while allowing him to play mild games of hot-and-cold flirtation and discipline. It, too, led to a brush with the law. George Norton cited Melbourne as co-respondent in 1836 and, unlike the Branden affair, this one had its day in court. Acquittal was never in doubt, but Melbourne was bruised by the public exposure and his ardour for Mrs Norton cooled with what she felt to be indecent suddenness. He was soon engaged in the lists with Lady Stanhope, apparently a former mistress of his brother Fred.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister18341841"></a>Prime minister, 1834&#150;1841</h2>It was precisely Melbourne's lack of commitment on the major issues of the day that led to his premiership, when Lord Grey resigned in a huff over Irish affairs in July 1834. His doubts about reform reassured the king and the conservative sections of the whig majority, and yet his acquiescence to the lead then being taken on Irish tithe reform by Lord John Russell secured the support of the forward party. Furthermore, like Grey, he had the authority to play the honest broker among his fractious colleagues; he was, thought Durham, &#145;the only one of whom none of us would be jealous&#146;  (Ziegler, 169). Greville claimed that Melbourne's languor nearly overcame his ambition on this occasion, but that he was persuaded to take the premiership by Tom Young: &#145;Why, damn it, such a position never was occupied by any Greek or Roman, and, if it only lasts two months, it is well worth while to have been Prime Minister of England&#146;. &#145;By God that's true&#146;, Melbourne is said to have replied, &#145;I'll go&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.76).<br>
<br>Yet Melbourne did not show much enthusiasm for the job, declining to move into Downing Street and lingering at Lady Holland's dinner table as late as ever. When, in October, Althorp resigned on the inheritance of his peerage and the king took advantage of the moment to dismiss the government, Melbourne was accused by Brougham and the radicals of giving up office too easily. He then left to Duncannon the business of organizing whig candidates for the ensuing general election, and to Duncannon and Russell the strategy for the new session of parliament. He agreed to employ his personal authority to persuade James Abercromby to contest the speakership and allowed Russell to make Irish tithe appropriation the point of principle on which the tory government was to be challenged, but kept aloof from the Lichfield House compact of 18 February 1835 by which Irish and radical votes were secured for these causes. He was not, therefore, the architect of his own return to the premiership in April 1835.<br>
<br>Melbourne was not much more the architect of the new government. On one point, the exclusion of Durham and Brougham&#151;who had offended him on personal as well as political grounds&#151;he was insistent. But otherwise much of the running in the appointment of ministers and the determination of policy was to be made by Russell, and in foreign affairs by Palmerston. Melbourne's principal task, as before, was to mediate between different sections of the party. He continued to feel that the maintenance of the whigs in power was necessary to cement the people's affections to government, but he had no personal enthusiasm for specific legislative objectives. His task was paradoxically made somewhat easier by the small size of the majority (smaller still after the 1837 election), which to some extent cowed the radicals. In the Lords, where he and the equally lukewarm Lansdowne presided, it was a matter simply of accepting gracefully repeated tory vetoes, particularly on Irish tithes and corporations. As in 1834 this exposed him to accusations of insufficient zeal, on occasions almost treachery, but his critics knew that Russell held the real power in the Commons and that a more pushful premier would hardly have had better luck with the Lords. On a few issues, such as English municipal reform, Melbourne's influence may have been crucial in persuading the tories not to obstruct.<br>
<br>Though he took no lead in policy, in other respects Melbourne was a worthy premier. As Greville observed, he was &#145;a gentleman, liberal and straightforward, with no meanness, and incapable of selfish trickery and intrigue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.118). He kept order in cabinet and handled some fragile egos with frank good humour. He took his patronage responsibilities seriously and was fairly meritocratic, though he deluded himself in thinking Lord Lichfield one of the ablest as well as one of the pleasantest men in England. His bold appointment in 1836 of the heterodox R. D. Hampden to the regius professorship of divinity at Oxford aroused a storm of controversy, against which Melbourne persisted, but his ecclesiastical appointments were thereafter less adventurous. In foreign affairs he mediated capably between cabinet Francophiles such as Lord Holland and the irrepressibly aggressive Lord Palmerston.<br>
<br>After the 1837 election, which again reduced the whig majority, Melbourne's level of political activity dwindled further. Russell handled most of the complicated negotiations necessary to retain the support of the radicals. The central issues of domestic policy&#151;Irish and English poor laws, the penny post, education&#151;held no appeal for Melbourne and were also delegated to Russell. He had a little more appetite for some contentious issues that arose in colonial policy. The rehabilitation of Lord Durham, appointed governor-in-chief of British North America in January 1838, was an imaginative move&#151;a radical sent to suppress rebellion and at the same time lay the foundation for self-government&#151;although it foundered finally on the bad personal relations subsisting between governor and premier. On Canada and also on Jamaica, Melbourne had cause to criticize his colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg, but personal loyalty to this old Canningite caused him to stave off calls for his resignation until early 1839, when he finally accepted Glenelg's replacement, first by Lord Normanby and then by Lord John Russell.<h2>
<a name="Thecourtier18371841"></a>The courtier, 1837&#150;1841</h2>Aside from habitual inclination, the principal reason for Melbourne's progressive disengagement from politics after 1837 was his involvement in a new romance, one peculiarly justifiable as in the line of duty. The object of his affections was the young Queen Victoria. She came to the throne in June 1837, aged eighteen and unmarried, and immediately latched onto Melbourne as a mentor preferable to her domineering mother, the duchess of Kent. Melbourne, for his part, was lonely. He had been hurt by the Norton fiasco of 1836 and also, in a different way, by the death of his invalid son, Augustus, in November of the same year. He now recognized the potential for the most satisfying relationship of his life. As her subject (and a sixty-year-old one, at that) flirtation with Victoria was not in question. But he could expose all of his foibles&#151;his loose talk, his cynicism, his odd mannerisms, indeed his occasional outbursts of naked emotion&#151;without fear of reproof or ridicule from a devoted young woman, while simultaneously doing his duty as man and statesman by tutoring her in society and politics. For her part, she could depend on him totally without impropriety, and yet by virtue of her status and her own strong will never quite appear dependent or lose the power to command. Melbourne liked both her dependence and her authority: she was Caroline within safe bounds.<br>
<br>Most of the attention lavished on their relationship has necessarily focused on its impact upon the monarch&#151;her education and character formation. Its impact upon Melbourne was greatly to increase his happiness and also to limit further his political effectiveness. Riddance of William IV, who had carped at and quarrelled with Melbourne incessantly, would have benefited any premier. But only this one would have wasted the time gained&#151;and more&#151;in <i>causerie</i> with the queen. He acted as her private secretary and had his own bedroom at Windsor.<br>
<br>In 1839 this excessive intimacy got Melbourne into two bad scrapes. Early in the year, Victoria developed the idea that two of her <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i> at court&#151;her mother's agent, Sir John Conroy, and a tory lady-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings&#151;were romantically involved. When Lady Flora began to display signs of illness and a distended stomach, this idea budded into the notion of an illicit pregnancy. Melbourne's idle chatter encouraged this notion and at first he did nothing to ascertain its truthfulness. Rumour was allowed to fester and ultimately Lady Flora was submitted to a humiliating examination by the queen's doctor, Sir James Clark. Her relatives and their political allies generated much righteous indignation. Melbourne was made to seem cruelly partisan and manipulative. The affair flared up again when Lady Flora died in July&#151;a post-mortem revealed the &#145;pregnancy&#146; to be an enormous liver tumour&#151;and both premier and queen were heckled in public.<br>
<br>By then, however, their relationship had already plunged Melbourne into a second, more severe crisis. On 6 May enough radicals had voted against the government in a division on the government of Jamaica to bring their majority down to five. Melbourne and Russell agreed that resignation was the only recourse. Victoria was appalled. &#145;All, ALL my happiness gone&#146;, she keened to her journal. &#145;That happy peaceful life destroyed, that dearest kind Lord Melbourne no more my minister&#146;  (Ziegler, 273). Again Melbourne indulged the queen in her partisanship. He encouraged her to think she could keep her whig ladies-in-waiting and, perhaps inadvertently, gave her courage to rebuff Peel's and Wellington's requests on the composition of her court. His partiality was to the queen rather than to office; he had to be pressed by the cabinet to make a political point of the queen's wishes. The upshot of this &#145;bedchamber&#146; crisis was that the whigs were kept in office. &#145;I will not abandon my Sovereign in a situation of difficulty and distress&#146;, Melbourne told the Lords on 14 May. Again it appeared that the elderly subject was unchivalrously manipulating the young monarch for personal gain. The radicals were brought back into line by the minor concession of a free vote on the ballot&#151;it lost comfortably&#151;and the government carried on, as it might have done anyway, had Melbourne not resigned in the first place. Further damage from this anomalous situation was prevented by arrangements for the queen's marriage to her cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.<br>
<br>The loss of intimacy this marriage entailed deprived Melbourne of his last compelling reason to remain in office. Yet the circumstances of his departure were no more under his control than had been his arrival. After dealing with the royal marriage his main preoccupation in 1840 was the old one of mediating between Palmerston and Holland over relations with France. Palmerston had become the premier's brother-in-law in December 1839, when he had finally been able to wed his lover, Emily, upon Lord Cowper's demise. He was now insisting on a check to French pretensions in the Middle East, where France's client Mehmet Ali was undermining the integrity of the Ottoman empire. The threat of war with France hung over the cabinet all summer and into the autumn. Ultimately war was averted and still Mehmet Ali was contained&#151;a victory for Palmerston's sabre-rattling policy, though some said also for Melbourne's quiet diplomacy within the cabinet and with the French.<br>
<br>At the start of 1841 Russell and the more committed whigs proposed a partial embrace of the anti-cornlaw issue as a device, if not to avert loss of office, at least to leave office on a point of liberal principle. Cabinet discussions over the 1841 budget were heated and divided over whether and how much to reduce the corn duties. The story goes that after the climactic meeting in March, Melbourne stopped his departing colleagues to ask:<blockquote>By the bye, there is one thing we haven't agreed upon, which is, what we are to say. Is it to make our corn dearer or cheaper, or to make the price steady? I don't care which: but we had better all be in the same story. (Walpole, 1.369)</blockquote>True or not, the anecdote reproduces accurately Melbourne's attitude at the time; in principle opposed to reducing protection, he was in practice willing to accept his cabinet's judgement on matters of political necessity. Russell hoped to be beaten on the corn duties and to go to the country on the issue, but before it was broached Peel won a vote of no confidence on the reduction of duties on sugar. At this stage (4 June) Melbourne wanted to resign, but his colleagues were keen to have their election and forced him to dissolve parliament instead. To Melbourne's great relief, the government lost its majority in the ensuing election and he resigned at the end of August. Maintaining his reputation for probity to the end, he declined the queen's pressing offer of the Garter.<h2>
<a name="Retreatandretrospect18411848"></a>Retreat and retrospect, 1841&#150;1848</h2>Melbourne confessed to the queen that he had aged greatly during his last year in office. Freedom from responsibility lightened his step somewhat, though he missed his frequent meetings with the queen and regretted her new absorption in her husband. He made few moves actively to oppose Peel's government, but neither did Russell. He spent more time with the Palmerstons and resumed more frequent contact with Mrs Norton. But his temper was shorter and his manners in public more abrupt; he began finally to lose his good looks (hitherto retained despite a certain middle-aged portliness) and his sensual appearance of indulgence and self-indulgence. Then in October 1842 he was brought down by a stroke which paralysed the left side of his body. Recovery was only partial, and thereafter he was increasingly confined to Brocket, where he was cared for by his brother Fred (now Lord Beauvale) and his sister-in-law, Adine.<br>
<br>Whig opposition revived gradually but Melbourne was not a participant. Yet when it looked for a moment in December 1845 as if Russell might be able to form a government, some people imagined that Melbourne might return, if only in a decorative role. Melbourne ruled himself out on the grounds that he was unsympathetic to repeal of the corn laws, but this was merely a graceful excuse. He was by now making only rare forays from home and, after a series of seizures, he died at Brocket on 24 November 1848, some months short of his seventieth birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Hatfield, near Brocket.<br>
<br>Melbourne has always been more interesting to posterity as a psychological than as a political study. Able to view him safely as the product of a bygone age, even earnest Victorians retailed with relish anecdotes of his incredible carelessness and cynicism, and of his relations with Caroline, Mrs Norton, and Victoria. Many of these stories derive from Greville, who was perhaps inclined to exaggerate Melbourne's illiberalism, owing to Greville's own politics and his friendship with Melbourne's half-tory brother Fred. The general impression of political frivolousness and sexual peccadillo was then greatly reinforced by Lord David Cecil's brilliant two-volume biography (1939, 1954). In particular the first volume, <span class="italic">The Young Melbourne</span>, with its panoptic prologue on Regency high society, &#145;The World&#146;, gave a seductive portrait of aristocratic wit and sensuality before the dark Victorian night set in that appealed greatly to both dandies and moderns.<br>
<br>Cecil's view was that Melbourne was psychologically complex but politically simple, an aristocratic amateur, and thus in the &#145;industrial age&#146; a political anachronism. Little evidence was presented to complicate this portrait until Philip Ziegler's more detailed, more accurate, and better-documented political biography of 1976. Ziegler accepted much of Cecil's psychologizing&#151;and added new evidence relating to Lady Branden&#151;but hotly disputed the political conclusion, arguing that Melbourne's diplomatic and tactical skills were crucial to keeping together the whig cabinets of the 1830s and holding the middle ground between toryism and radicalism. Ziegler's revision has been supported to some extent; certainly Melbourne's aristocratic background is no longer viewed as a handicap. But Melbourne had no part in the new moral, economic, and religious thinking that allowed other aristocrats&#151;including his fellow Canningites, even Palmerston&#151;to refurbish their image as governors for a wider audience and to deal with modern problems of legislation. His peculiar noncommittal style was unique. It did allow him to play political umpire and serve as a reassuring anchor of integrity in the troubled seas of reform. But the limits to this role are underscored by L. G. Mitchell in his biography <span class="italic">Lord Melbourne</span> (1997), which returns to the social and psychological ground broken by David Cecil. Future biographies may well follow in Cecil's and Mitchell's path, for whatever depths William Lamb may still be hiding from us are probably more of private than of public import.<br>
