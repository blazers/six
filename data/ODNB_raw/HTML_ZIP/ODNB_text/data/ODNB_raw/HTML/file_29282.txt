<span class="headword">Whitefoord,  Caleb</span>  (1734&#150;1810), <span class="occ">wine merchant and diplomatist</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the natural son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29283/', "Charles Whitefoord (d. 1753)")</script>, an army officer descended from a titled Ayrshire family. He was educated at John Mundell's school in Edinburgh, showing great skill in classics, and at Edinburgh University, where he matriculated on 3 March 1748. His father wanted him to become a minister in the Church of Scotland, but Caleb disliked this idea, and in 1750 he was taken instead to London and apprenticed to Archibald Stewart, an eminent wine merchant in Buckingham Street. He travelled on business to Portugal and France and acquired a love for the London theatre and for the company of men of letters. An inheritance from his father enabled him to set up a partnership in the wine trade in 1754 with Thomas Brown, a young merchant who shared his convivial tastes, at 38 Craven Street, where Benjamin Franklin would become their neighbour and friend. The firm prospered and Whitefoord found time to engage in humorous and political journalism. His <span class="italic">New Method of Reading Newspapers</span> (1766) greatly amused the usually critical Horace Walpole and also found favour with Oliver Goldsmith and Samuel Johnson. The government hoped he might write a pamphlet on the Falkland Islands question in 1771, and it was Whitefoord who recommended Johnson for the task.<br>
<br>On Franklin's proposal Whitefoord became a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1762 and was active in its proceedings for the remainder of his life, serving as a committee chairman and a vice-president. Through his friendship with Joshua Reynolds he became involved in the affairs of the Royal Academy after its foundation in 1768. He collected pictures by old and modern masters and was himself an amateur artist, whose portrait of Franklin was admired by its subject.<br>
<br>Whitefoord's friendship with Franklin earned him both historical importance and contemporary fame. When an end was sought to the war with the American colonies in 1782, Whitefoord was chosen by Lord Shelburne to go with Richard Oswald to France and act as an intermediary between Franklin and the British government. He served for a year as secretary to the commission that concluded peace with the United States and though Oswald had promised to lobby on his behalf for some financial recompense he received no payment until 1793, when he was granted a pension of &pound;200 a year.<br>
<br>In 1790 Whitefoord moved to the Adelphi, first to John Street and then to James Street, where his friend Isaac Disraeli, who he proposed as a member of the nearby Society of Antiquaries, also had an apartment. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1784 and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1791. He spent much time at Hanworth with Mary Sidday (1775&#150;1852), with whom he had a son, Charles, in 1797 and whom he married on 21 January 1800. Five more children followed: Maria (<i>b</i>. 1802), Caleb (<i>b</i>. 1805), who became rector of Burford, Oxfordshire, twins Charles and Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1807), and John (1809&#150;1892), who became a magistrate in Tasmania. In 1805 he purchased a large house in Argyll Street (no. 28), a turning off Oxford Street, and in the same year he helped to found the British Institution.<br>
<br>Whitefoord was described by J. T. Smith as &#145;a slight built man and much addicted when in conversation to shrug up his shoulders. He had a thin face, with little eyes&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Book</span>, 114). His dandified and old-fashioned style of dress noted by Smith was recorded in Wilkie's painting, <span class="italic">The Letter of Introduction</span>. His death on 4 February 1810 at his Argyll Street home was caused by a sudden illness that took only two days to prove mortal. He was buried on 9 February in the churchyard of St Mary's, Paddington. His widow remarried on 25 July 1812; her second husband was John Lee. She died on 18 May 1852.<br>
<br>A memoir in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> described Whitefoord as one of those men of &#145;easy, good natured, social disposition, that &hellip; have always seemed <i>necessary links</i> of the great chain that binds Society together&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 163). His one weakness was a failure to apply himself to any one sphere of creative endeavour. He preferred to work behind the scenes and his significance lies not merely in his famous flurry into international diplomacy, but in his long years of voluntary work, both institutionally and personally, in promoting the arts and letters of his country.<br>
