</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orage,  Alfred Richard</span>  (1873&#150;1934), <span class="occ">journal editor and advocate of social credit</span>, was born on 22 January 1873 at Dacre, near Bradford, Yorkshire, the last of four children of William Steverson Orage (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1875), farmer and later head teacher at his own school at Dacre, and his wife, Sarah Anne McQuire (<i>d</i>. 1895). Soon after his father's death the young Orage and his brother and sisters moved with their mother to Fenstanton, near Huntingdon, where her family lived. Raised in simple circumstances, Orage was educated at the local village school, at Fenstanton, where he later taught as a pupil teacher, before entering a teacher training college at Culham, Oxfordshire. In 1893 he took up a post as a teacher in an elementary school in Leeds, and in 1896 married Jean Walker (<i>fl</i>. 1875&#150;1927), a skilled craftswoman in the William Morris tradition, who shared his interest in theosophy and the arts.<br>
<br>Even as a young man Orage had wide-ranging personal and social concerns, including not only education, but philosophy, painting, public speaking, literature, Fabian socialism, and religious belief. With the journalist Holbrook Jackson, whom he met in 1900, he founded the Leeds Arts Club, a thriving civic organization. His early passion for theosophy and Plato soon gave way to an interest in psychoanalysis and the mystical tradition, and he and his wife decided to live apart. In 1906 he left teaching for journalism and moved to London.<br>
<br>In 1907, encouraged by George Bernard Shaw, Orage and Jackson bought the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, a weekly review whose character quickly came to reflect Orage's principles and tastes. Eager to encourage young writers as well as to print established names of the period, Orage became the journal's sole editor in 1909. Helped in his work by a number of friends, Orage was especially close at this time to Beatrice Hastings, his partner from 1907 until 1915, whose angry memoir nevertheless reveals her deep feeling for a man of great energy and generosity. Of middle height, with a prominent nose, full lips, and intense, direct eyes under hair invariably combed boyishly to one side, Orage impressed colleagues and strangers as a personally compelling presence, a vibrant and informed lecturer, and a reflective and perceptive mind.<br>
<br>Among the contributors to the <span class="italic">New Age</span> were such established authors as Shaw and Henry James, yet the journal also included work by new and modernist writers, among them A. E., Richard Aldington, Michael Arlen, Clifford Bax, Hilaire Belloc, G. D. H. Cole, Eric Gill, T. E. Hulme, Storm Jameson, Augustus John, Ezra Pound, Llewellyn Powys, and Herbert Read. In addition to current developments in art and writing, the editor's personal enthusiasms included Russian literature, French philosophy, guild socialism, and English economic theory. Orage printed Paul Selver's translations of Nietzsche's letters to Strindberg; Aldington's translations of selected Latin Renaissance poets; and a translation of Chekhov's &#145;The chemist's wife&#146;. The <span class="italic">New Age</span> also published essays on current medical matters (such as &#145;The psychical treatment of insanity&#146;), on feminist issues (&#145;The male suffragist&#146;), and on social credit (&#145;The nemesis of capitalist production&#146;). Orage's sense of an intellectual world community was also reflected in the journal's articles on such topics as French literary movements, Polish poetry, and Islam, as well as in regular features on foreign affairs. Orage wrote his own column, &#145;Readers and writers&#146;, signed with a pseudonym like many of the pieces in the journal. A book of his essays appeared under the same title in 1922.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">New Age</span> had a small but influential circulation, and both before and during the First World War reflected and helped to shape the climate of artistic experimentation in the capital. After the war Orage became interested in Clifford Douglas's economic system of social credit, a theory he advocated in his journal from 1918 onwards. At this time, influenced first by the Serbian mystic Dimiti Mitrinovi&#263; and then by the occultist P. D. Ouspensky, he also developed a particular interest in spiritualism, and soon became a disciple of the Russian mystic George Gurdjieff. In October 1922 Orage gave up his editorial position at the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, and spent a year at Gurdjieff's institute, Le Prieur&eacute;, at Fontainebleau. There, with a community of followers, he engaged in both manual farm labour and philosophic study. Orage left France in 1923 and spent the next seven years primarily in New York, but travelled and lectured throughout the United States. He had already written extensively on literary and economic subjects, not only in the <span class="italic">New Age</span> but in such books as <span class="italic">Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">An Alphabet of Economics</span> (1917); now Orage focused his attention on religious and psychological issues. In the course of his tireless lecturing, he formed a relationship with an American woman, Jessie Dwight (<i>fl</i>. 1907&#150;1949), who became his secretary. After securing a divorce from his first wife, Orage married Dwight in 1927. With occasional visits to London and to Fontainebleau, Orage remained in America, lecturing primarily on Gurdjieff's philosophy and raising funds for Le Prieur&eacute;. Orage's love for his new wife and son, however, forced him to re-examine his involvement with Gurdjieff, with whom he finally broke in 1930. Orage decided to come back to England, and settled first near Rye in Sussex, then in Hampstead, London, with his family, which soon included a daughter.<br>
<br>Returning during the last years of his life to his earlier interests in literature and economics, Orage once more focused his energies on journalism. In 1932, at the depths of the depression, he founded the <span class="italic">New English Weekly</span>, championing social credit and publishing the work of both established and newly discovered authors, among them the young Dylan Thomas. Ardent, socially committed, and hopeful, Orage remained, in Philip Mairet's words, a lifelong seeker of &#145;a light that never was on sea or land&#146;  (Mairet, v). Orage told Mairet that he found England &#145;a deadly country: a heaven for the rich, but purgatory for the talented and hell for the poor&#146;  (ibid., 116). T. S. Eliot referred to Orage, again according to Mairet, as &#145;the finest critical intelligence of our days&#146;  (ibid., 121). Indeed, Orage worked tirelessly for both the social and the spiritual causes in which he believed, until his sudden death at his home, 4 The Mount, Heath Street, Hampstead, London, in all likelihood from heart disease, on 6 November 1934. His funeral service was conducted by the dean of Canterbury at the Hampstead parish church, after which Orage was buried in the local churchyard under a gravestone carved by Eric Gill.<br>
