<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fieldhouse,  John David Elliott</span>, Baron Fieldhouse  (1928&#150;1992), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 12 February 1928 at 32 Wyther Park Road, Bramley, Leeds, the elder of the two sons of Sir Harold Fieldhouse (1892&#150;1991), secretary of the National Assistance Board from 1946 to 1959, and his wife, Mabel Elaine (1900&#150;1993), daughter of George Henry Elliott, of Conisbrough, Yorkshire. He went to Quainton Hall School, Harrow, and joined the navy as a cadet in 1941, going to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and later at Eaton Hall in Cheshire, and in 1945 to the training cruiser <i>Frobisher</i>. His first ship as a midshipman was the cruiser <i>Nigeria</i> in the East Indies fleet. He learned to fly as a sub-lieutenant but the Fleet Air Arm did not appeal. As he said, he &#145;did not join the Navy to do circuits-and-bumps on a grass strip&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 Feb 1992), and he was airsick, just as he was chronically seasick. A visit to a submarine decided his future. He joined the Submarine Service in 1948 and after service in <i>Thule</i>, <i>Astute</i>, and <i>Aeneas</i> he was appointed first lieutenant of <i>Totem</i> in 1952 (when he was nicknamed Snorkers owing to his fondness for sausages&#151;like the Australian first lieutenant in <span class="italic">The Cruel Sea</span>). On 28 March 1953 he married Margaret Ellen Carey 
    (Midge; <i>b</i>. 1927/8)
  , daughter of David Donington Cull, an accountant. She was then serving as an officer with the Women's Royal Naval Service, at Lee on the Solent, Hampshire. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Fieldhouse passed the commanding officers' qualifying course (the Perisher) in 1955, his first command being <i>Acheron</i>. He subsequently commanded the submarines <i>Tiptoe</i> and <i>Walrus</i> and, in 1964, the Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine, <i>Dreadnought</i>. He served almost exclusively in the Submarine Service until 1966, when he took the joint services staff college course at Latimer and then joined the aircraft-carrier <i>Hermes</i> in 1967 as second in command. <i>Hermes</i>, then the first &#145;all-missile&#146; ship in the fleet, had a busy and successful commission east and west of Suez, which included the preparations for the withdrawal from Aden. <i>Hermes</i>'s Sea Vixen and Buccaneer aircraft provided a show of strength in the air. Her Wessex helicopters carried out sorties against &#145;dissidents&#146; in Aden and, in August the same year, against communist agitators in Hong Kong. Fieldhouse took over command of the ship for some weeks when the captain fell ill at the end of the year.<br>
<br>After his promotion to captain at the end of 1967, Fieldhouse's career began to follow the perfect &#145;critical path&#146; to the highest ranks. From <i>Hermes</i> he went in 1968 to Faslane in Scotland as captain of the newly formed 10th submarine squadron of Polaris submarines. In 1970 he commanded the frigate <i>Diomede</i> as captain of the 3rd frigate squadron; and in 1972 he led NATO's naval standing force, Atlantic, in the rank of commodore. In 1973 he went to the Ministry of Defence, first as deputy and then as director of naval warfare. Promoted rear-admiral, he became flag officer, 2nd flotilla, in 1975 and then, the next year, flag officer, submarines, and NATO commander, submarines, eastern Atlantic&#151;in effect the first post-war officer to hold this post, and the first to have a nuclear command. He showed his political skills early on by adroitly handling a move from the traditional home at Fort Blockhouse, Gosport, to Northwood. Promoted vice-admiral in 1979, he became controller of the navy, responsible for the navy's ships, stores, and equipment. In the time-honoured way of seagoing officers, Fieldhouse always said he disliked Ministry of Defence jobs. &#145;I joined the Navy to go to sea,&#146; he would say, &#145;not to drive a desk at the MoD.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 Feb 1992). In fact, he was an excellent Whitehall warrior, but the most he would admit was that, having had good times at sea, he now had to pay something back. In 1981 he was made commander-in-chief, fleet, NATO commander-in-chief, eastern Atlantic area, and allied commander-in-chief, channel. It was a time when an aggrieved and resentful navy was trying to recover something from what was left after the swingeing cuts imposed by the then secretary of state for defence, John Nott. It was a measure of how well Fieldhouse restored both the navy's <i>materiel</i> and its morale that it was able to undertake Operation Corporate (the recovery of the Falklands) so successfully less than a year later.<br>
<br>Fieldhouse was commander-in-chief, fleet, at the time of the Falklands conflict in 1982 and, as the task force commander, was responsible for the planning and direction of Operation Corporate to recover the islands. He was responsible directly to the chief of the defence staff, Admiral Sir Terence Lewin, and his mission was to conduct military deployment and operations to bring about the withdrawal of Argentinian forces and to re-establish British administration as quickly as possible. In common with the then first sea lord, Admiral Sir Henry Leach, Fieldhouse never doubted that this task was possible. Their confidence was in the strongest contrast to the attitude of the Ministry of Defence civil servants. Late in March 1982, when the first rumblings of the diplomatic storm could be heard, Fieldhouse was in the Mediterranean where Royal Navy ships were exercising. Little was known about the Argentinian opposition; indeed, the planning for Corporate may be said to have begun with Fieldhouse and the flag officer, 1st flotilla, Rear-Admiral John (Sandy) Woodward&#151;who was to be the carrier battle group commander at sea&#151;kneeling on the deck of the admiral's day-cabin in the destroyer <i>Glamorgan</i>, studying the ships of the Argentinian navy in <span class="italic">Jane's Fighting Ships</span>. Woodward was ordered to sail for the Ascension Island area with six destroyers and frigates and support from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Later in April Fieldhouse flew to Ascension to confer with Woodward and then returned to direct the war from commander-in-chief, fleet's headquarters in the concrete fortress at Northwood, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Those who served with Fieldhouse at the time were greatly impressed by his imperturbability and good humour, even at times of the greatest stress. He had to fight a war under a most unusual degree of political pressure and exposure. He had to minimize casualties and to avoid losing public support for the venture. He had also to bear in mind the navy's traditionally abysmal handling of press relations, which could effortlessly make a victory look like a defeat. At Woodward's request he changed the rules of engagement to allow the submarine <i>Conqueror</i> to sink the Argentinian cruiser <i>General Belgrano</i>, which was menacing the southern flank of Woodward's ships. But he was merciful in victory, specifically ordering <i>Conqueror</i> not to attack ships picking up <i>Belgrano</i>'s survivors, although <i>Conqueror</i> had herself been depth-charged by those same ships. Lacking the strength for an opposed landing, Fieldhouse accepted Woodward's decision to take a calculated risk in landing the troops at San Carlos. He knew he was thereby flouting one of the bitterest lessons of the Second World War&#151;that one must have at least local air superiority before attempting an amphibious operation. It was a gamble that succeeded triumphantly but could have resulted in terrible losses.<br>
<br>Fieldhouse's leadership was at its best in the moments of high drama: the Exocet attack on <i>Sheffield</i>; the loss of destroyers and frigates to bombs, showing that, despite all the money spent, the navy's ships were <i>still</i> not capable of defending themselves against determined air attack; and the disaster to <i>Sir Galahad</i> and <i>Sir Tristram</i> at Fitzroy. Past economies and wrong decisions meant that the task force lacked long-range airborne early warning and heavy enough anti-aircraft fire, but in many ways Fieldhouse presided over a curiously old-fashioned war, with many of the tactics the navy has used for centuries: decoy and deception, blockade and bombardment, covert operations and convoy. In the end, the Falklands were recovered by what Fieldhouse called a triumph of military capability backed by resolute political will. &#145;All difficulties,&#146; he said, &#145;of short notice, extreme range and appalling weather were overcome by the quality of our people. They were magnificent. I could not have been better served&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 Feb 1992).<br>
<br>In December 1982 Fieldhouse became first sea lord and chief of the naval staff, only the second submarine officer ever to do so. As first sea lord he fought the navy's corner with great skill and guile, eventually restoring much of the position lost to Nott. He improved, if that were possible, as a politician, being more than a match for the slyest Ministry of Defence civil servant. He defended the choice of Trident to replace Polaris as Britain's independent deterrent, arguing that it was still by far the most cost-effective option. He accused the European nations, including Britain, of what he called &#145;sea blindness&#146;, and urged a much greater political appreciation of the virtues of worldwide sea power, especially for Britain, which was still an island.<br>
<br>Fieldhouse was promoted admiral of the fleet in August 1985 (the first submarine officer to reach that rank) and in November that year he took over as chief of the defence staff and chairman of the chiefs of staff committee, a position normally rotated between the three services. It was thought that his appointment out of turn was due to Margaret Thatcher, in her gratitude to the architect of the Falklands victory. He retired in December 1988, and was a very strong contender for the post of chairman of the military committee of NATO. He was actually in Brussels for a bi-annual meeting at which the election of the new chairman was on the agenda, when he suffered a burst aorta in his heart, leading to a lengthy operation. He was appointed KCB in 1980, GCB and GBE in 1982, and created a life peer as Baron Fieldhouse of Gosport in 1990. In retirement he was a consultant to Vosper Thorneycroft (UK) Ltd. In 1990 he became chairman of the White Ensign Association. In spite of his face and figure (he enjoyed good food and wine) and the benign, avuncular, almost Dickensian aspect of himself which he liked to show to the world in his conversation and his jokes, other naval officers sometimes found Fieldhouse a difficult personality to read. There was a story of an officer who had gone to see him about some difficulty and come away convinced he had an ally&#151;&#145;but it's only when you look round and your head falls off that you realise your throat's just been cut&#146;  (private information). He liked sailing (he was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron) and listed his recreations as &#145;home, family and friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>). Despite his eminence, he was the most unassuming of men, being on first-name terms with the staff of his local supermarket. He died at Southampton General Hospital on 17 February 1992; his ashes were buried at sea on 28 February. He was survived by his wife and three children. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 27 May 1992.<br>
