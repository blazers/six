<span class="headword">Ois&iacute;n <span class="st"> [Ossian]</span></span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>3rd&#150;5th cent.), <span class="occ">legendary hero</span>, was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill in the Fenian or Ossianic cycle of tales and lays that belongs to the Gaelic literary and oral traditions of Ireland and Scotland. He was assigned a floruit in the third century <span class="smallcap">AD</span> by medieval Irish scholars whose chronology of events connected with the pseudo-historical <i>Fianna</i> (warrior or hunter bands) of Fionn mac Cumhaill was commonly accepted until the end of the nineteenth century. The name Ois&iacute;n (earlier Oss&eacute;ne or Oss&iacute;ne) is a diminutive formed from the noun <i>os</i> (&#145;deer&#146;) and a verse source in the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>, a twelfth-century manuscript, states that his mother, Bla&iacute; Derg, conceived him when she was in the shape of a hind. References to such a conception are also found in later Irish literary and oral sources, as well as in Scottish Gaelic oral tradition.<br>
<br>Although Ois&iacute;n features in material dating from approximately the eighth century, it was not until the twelfth century that he appeared in his main role in Fenian literature, that of an aged survivor and eyewitness of the deeds of the <i>Fianna</i>. According to the oldest version of <span class="italic">Acallam na Sen&oacute;rach</span> (&#145;The colloquy of the old men&#146;), dating from about 1200, Ois&iacute;n and Ca&iacute;lte, another member of the <i>Fianna</i>, survived the defeat and destruction of the <i>Fianna</i> and lived until the introduction of Christianity to Ireland by Patrick some 150 years afterwards. Both of them met Patrick and regaled him and other ecclesiastical and temporal dignitaries with anecdotes, in prose and verse, about the exploits of Fionn and his warriors and their association with various places in Ireland. Ca&iacute;lte is given a more prominent role than Ois&iacute;n in the earliest version of <span class="italic">Acallam na Sen&oacute;rach</span>, but in the later version, and in many of the Fenian lays composed from the thirteenth century on, Ois&iacute;n is cast as the main narrator and repository of traditional lore regarding the <i>Fianna</i> and the antiquities of Ireland.<br>
<br>The early literary tradition fails to explain Ois&iacute;n's remarkable longevity. Oral tradition on the other hand declares that he spent the time between the destruction of the <i>Fianna</i> and the advent of Patrick in the mythical Land of Youth (<i>T&iacute;r na h&Oacute;ige</i> or <i>T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g</i>). According to some versions of this legend his deer-mother enticed him thither, but the most popular version of the story has it that he was brought to this happy otherworld by a supernatural lover. He remained there until an overwhelming desire to visit his father and former colleagues in arms compelled him to leave the Land of Youth and return to Ireland. By accidentally touching the soil of Ireland he became old and blind and after his meeting with Patrick he functions as a link between the pagan Fenian past and the Christian present. The eighteenth-century &#145;Laoidh Ois&iacute;n ar Th&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g&#146; (&#145;Ois&iacute;n's lay about the Land of the Young&#146;), attributed by some to the Clare poet and author Michael Comyn, names the woman who brings Ois&iacute;n to T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g as Niamh Chinn &Oacute;ir. This late literary version of Ois&iacute;n's otherworld journey has, since its translation and appearance in print in 1859, appealed to a wide audience. William Butler Yeats utilized it in his long narrative poem &#145;The Wandering of Oisin&#146;, first published in 1889.<br>
<br>Another important literary development associated with the name of Ois&iacute;n occurred in the eighteenth century with the publication by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17728/', "James Macpherson")</script> of <span class="italic">Fingal: an Ancient Epic Poem</span> (1762) and <span class="italic">Temora</span> (1763), works allegedly translated from epic poems which Macpherson claimed had been composed by a blind third-century Caledonian poet called Ossian, a name based on the vernacular Scottish Gaelic form Oisean. The term Ossianic, used as an alternative appellation of the Fenian cycle, derives from Macpherson's Ossian. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14918/', "Samuel Johnson")</script> denounced Macpherson's works on Ossian as fraudulent and a celebrated literary quarrel ensued (for which see their articles). An important result of the controversy surrounding these publications was the awakening of scholarly interest in Fenian literature in general.<br>
