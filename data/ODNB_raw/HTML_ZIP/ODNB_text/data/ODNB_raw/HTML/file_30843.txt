<span class="headword">Rochfort, Sir  Cecil Charles  Boyd-</span>  (1887&#150;1983), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 16 April 1887 at the family home, Middleton Park, co. Meath, the third son and seventh of eight children of Major Rochfort Hamilton Boyd (1844&#150;1891) of the 15th hussars (who assumed the additional name of Rochfort in 1888), and his wife, Florence Louisa (1855&#150;1944), daughter of Richard Hemming, of Bentley Manor, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>After schooling at Eton College, in 1906 Boyd-Rochfort became a pupil trainer with H. S. Persse at Grateley in Hampshire. In 1908 he became assistant trainer to Captain R. H. Dewhurst at Newmarket, and four years later left to become racing manager to Sir Ernest Cassel. He joined the Scots Guards in the First World War, was wounded on the Somme, and received the Croix de Guerre. A captain on demobilization, he returned to Newmarket and to managing Cassel's racing interests at Moulton Paddocks. A chance meeting led to Boyd-Rochfort's being invited to manage Marshall Field's horses as well.<br>
<br>On Cassel's death Boyd-Rochfort bought Freemason Lodge at Newmarket and commenced training for the season of 1923. His principal owners were Field and the Dowager Lady Nunburnholme. His first season yielded nineteen successes including the winner of the Newmarket July cup. Subsequent seasons brought a steady flow of winners but his first winner of a &#145;listed&#146; race was Royal Minstrel who won the Eclipse stakes in 1929.<br>
<br>The arrival of the Americans William Woodward and Joseph Widener as owners in 1930 marked a turning point in Boyd-Rochfort's career. The first classic success came in 1933 when Woodward's Brown Betty won the One Thousand Guineas. Boyd-Rochfort was now on the crest of the wave and in 1937 he became the leading trainer for the first of five times. In 1927 he had bought the filly Double Life for Lady Zia Wernher and in 1937 he had the satisfaction of training Double Life's son, Precipitation, to win the Ascot gold cup. He trained many winners from this family, culminating in the victory of Meld in the Oaks of 1955.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1939 forced Boyd-Rochfort to reduce his string to twenty-five horses but in 1943 he started training the horses from the private stable of King George VI. In 1946 he trained Hypericum, the king's only home-bred classic winner. The victories of well-bred fillies such as Avila, Angelola, and Above Board laid the foundation of Queen Elizabeth's many successes in the 1950s and 1960s. On 24 July 1944 he married Elizabeth Rohays Mary (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Major-General Sir James Lauderdale Gilbert Burnett of Leys, thirteenth baronet, and widow of Captain the Hon. Henry Kerr Auchmuty Cecil. They had one son.<br>
<br>On her accession Queen Elizabeth decided to continue keeping her home-bred horses at Freemason Lodge. Aureole was expected to win the coronation year Derby for her in 1953, but finished in second place to Pinza. The 1950s were golden years for the stable, which culminated in Boyd-Rochfort's winning both the Derby, with Parthia, and the King George VI stakes, with Alcide, in 1959. Thereafter the success rate of the then septuagenarian trainer declined but he continued to turn out top-class winners until his retirement in 1968.<br>
<br>Boyd-Rochfort was an excellent judge of a yearling and he liked to have a free hand in the selection of the horses he was to train. He had a deep and detailed knowledge of the stud book and consequently the studs of his owners usually flourished following his shrewd original purchases of their foundation mares. While he was always ready to spend money, he could be equally successful when operating within rigid financial controls. He was a punctilious correspondent and kept his owners regularly informed of the progress of their horses. Owners rarely quit the stable.<br>
<br>Boyd-Rochfort was a large man of infinite courtesy and impeccable manners, inspiring respect rather than affection. He ran a stable where good judgement, regularity, good feeding, attention to detail, and patience were the principal ingredients of success; a strict employer, he recruited and kept the best stable staff. He was a master of the art of training stayers. His skill with fillies was particularly noteworthy and P. T. Beasley, his second stable jockey, rated him the best trainer of fillies of his generation. He won thirteen classic races and 1156 others which earned prize money to the total of &pound;1,651,514.<br>
<br>Boyd-Rochfort initiated worldwide bloodstock and racing. His system of making out each horse's programme months in advance meant that foreign owners could partake personally in their horse's success. He was appointed CVO in 1952 and KCVO in 1968, the year in which he retired, at the end of the season. Boyd-Rochfort died at Kilnahard Castle, co. Cavan, on 17 March 1983.<br>
