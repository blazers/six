<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Byrne,  Fiach  MacHugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1544&#150;1597), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was probably born at Ballinacor in co. Wicklow, the first child of Hugh MacShane O'Byrne (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1579), chief of the Gabhal Raghnaill branch of the O'Byrne clan, and his first wife, Sadhbh (<i>c</i>.1530&#150;<i>c</i>.1600), daughter of Ph&eacute;lim Buidhe MacLorcan O'Byrne. Fiach was heir both to his father's inaccessible lands centring on Glenmalure in the Wicklow Mountains and to the precarious political situation that had grown out of the treaty signed by his grandfather Shane Oge MacRedmund in 1542. The treaty saw the multi-branched O'Byrne clan unilaterally surrender its lands to the crown only to have them regranted under English law and custom. It became clear, however, that the senior O'Byrnes of Crioch Branach, occupying the more fertile lowlands east of the Gabhal Raghnaill, were unduly favoured under the terms of the treaty, while the junior branches, particularly the Gabhal Raghnaill, were marginalized. Moreover, Tudor rule at the local level had by the 1560s become intrusive and high-handed, providing a visible focal point for Gaelic anger. Thus Fiach inherited an increasingly acrimonious relationship both with the senior O'Byrnes and with the Tudor administration: his father commenced hostilities in both directions in order to establish the status denied to the Gabhal Raghnaill by the 1542 treaty.<h2>
<a name="HughMacShaneslegacy"></a>Hugh MacShane's legacy</h2>Fiach's early years were spent close to his father, whose reputation as a resourceful chief or &#145;wily&#146; upstart had been growing. Fiach first appears in January 1563 when he was pardoned alongside his father for attempting to procure his neighbours' support in a rebellion against Lord Deputy Sussex; it was rumoured that Sussex planned to kill them in their beds at Christmas. The later 1560s saw similar pardons granted to Fiach as his father employed the dual strategy of acting aggressively toward the crown&#151;by capturing government officials, or by harbouring Irish rebels or exacting black rents&#151;and then securing a pardon for his actions. It was during this extension of Gabhal Raghnaill power, about 1565, that Fiach married Sadhbh (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;<i>c</i>.1581), daughter of a leading member of the Kavanaghs. His sister Margaret married Rory Oge O'More, leader of the expropriated O'More clan. These carefully planned marriages at once strengthened Hugh MacShane's hand and increased the frequency of co-ordinated Gaelic attacks against the crown.<br>
<br>In April 1572 Fiach and his brother-in-law Brian MacCahir Kavanagh were implicated in the murder of Robert Browne, an influential south co. Wexford landlord. The incident's severity was greatly aggravated because Browne had married the daughter of Nicholas White, seneschal of Wexford. Worse still, White, who was at court when the murder occurred, attracted the queen's personal interest in the matter. Elizabeth demanded justice and in July, Francis Agard, seneschal of O'Byrne's country, attacked the Gabhal Raghnaill, killing Fiach's brother who had allegedly been present at the murder. There is no evidence that Fiach had any involvement in Browne's murder other than his association with the Kavanaghs. Nevertheless he offered to apprehend the murderers. The compromise, however, was undermined as the vengeful White attacked the Gabhal Raghnaill, pushing them and their Gaelic allies into open rebellion. The revolt was suppressed by February 1573, but only following a concerted effort by seneschals White and Agard who, in the end, agreed to pardon both Fiach and his father. The affair established Fiach's reputation as a principal Gaelic leader in Leinster who reputedly commanded 200 kerne.<br>
<br>Fiach gradually eclipsed his father's influence. He pursued a more aggressive strategy toward his neighbours. The ageing Hugh MacShane, however, continued as the Gabhal Raghnaill chief, carrying out negotiations with government representatives while his son &#145;independently&#146; committed depredations against them. In December 1575 Lord Deputy Henry Sidney, following a progress from Dublin to Waterford which was incessantly hampered by Fiach, wrote of the Janus-faced O'Byrnes, &#145;the father was with me without protection, but the son lyveth aloof&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/59/17). In 1578 Thomas Masterson, then seneschal of Wexford, invited Fiach to a conference where the latter's capture or murder was intended. But following the massacre at Mullaghmast, Fiach approached the meeting with ample circumspection and soon received intelligence that alerted him to Masterson's ploy. He launched a successful counter-attack that might have resulted in the capture and ransom of Masterson himself. The government, however, continued an aggressive campaign. Rory Oge and many of his followers were killed and Hugh MacShane and Fiach MacHugh eventually surrendered in September&#150;October 1578. Fiach submitted at Christ Church where he recognized the new seneschal of the O'Byrnes, Sir Henry Harrington, as his &#145;captain&#146;. Following this, Fiach and his father travelled to Castledermot, co. Kildare, where they submitted to Lord Justice Sir William Drury. These dual roles, as dangerous rebel and obedient client, played masterfully by Fiach and Hugh MacShane, were now ended.<h2>
<a name="AnautonomouschieftaincyborderingDublin"></a>An autonomous chieftaincy bordering Dublin</h2>Fiach succeeded as chief of the Gabhal Raghnaill following his father's death in late 1579. The government now dealt with the Gabhal Raghnaill quite separately from the increasingly Anglicized senior O'Byrnes. Thus upon his accession Fiach had, in a way, achieved the distinction his father sought so desperately: he became the focus for Gaelic resistance in Leinster. Accordingly, in November 1579 the earl of Desmond&#151;in a desperate effort to extend his Munster rebellion to Leinster&#151;dispatched a letter to Fiach urging his support. Fiach did not throw in his lot with Desmond; instead he waited for more favourable circumstances to arise. This occurred rather unexpectedly when James Eustace, third Viscount Baltinglass, a landed Leinster gentleman imbued with Counter-Reformation Catholicism, tapped into Gaelic Leinster's disaffection with aggressive governmental policies and pledged to overthrow the queen in the pope's name. Fiach's religious devotion is difficult to gauge, but he at least paid lip-service to the zealous Baltinglass. By summer 1580 Fiach had allied himself with a leading member of the Crioch Branach O'Byrnes and some neighbouring O'Tooles and Kavanaghs. Fiach, belying his principal motivation, ravaged Wexford, thus taking revenge on seneschal Masterson who had in April murdered members of the Kavanagh clan. Thus a confluence of interests embodied by Fiach and Baltinglass brought a certain unity to Gaelic elements in Leinster while concurrently breathing life into Desmond's faltering rebellion. Yet Baltinglass failed to garner the active support of the pale gentry and the rebellion in Leinster lost momentum.<br>
<br>The deputy elect, Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, eager to suppress the rebellion, impetuously pursued the rebels into the fastness of the Wicklow Mountains. With a large but inexperienced retinue, Grey was defeated at Glenmalure on 25 August 1580. English losses were not heavy but a disproportionate number of officers had fallen. The victory was total and instilled confidence in the rebels. Fiach had trebled his strength of a decade earlier, now commanding some 600 kerne. A comparison with the estimated forty kerne available to his great-grandfather less than a century earlier illustrates his startling rise. In the months following, Fiach and his allies burnt Wicklow and attacked several lowland targets, including a settlement within 6 miles of Dublin. Their hopes were quickly dashed, however: Grey received further reinforcements and slaughtered Desmond's foreign aid in November. Militarily the rebels were no match for an amply supplied Grey who by May 1581 had placed garrisons near Fiach's power base at Castlekevin and Kilcommon. Moreover, certain of the senior O'Byrnes fought for the crown, in one instance killing four of Fiach's best men, and they perhaps facilitated Grey's burning of Ballinacor in April. Following Baltinglass's flight to the continent Fiach came to terms with the government, being pardoned in September after unsuccessfully attempting to secure religious freedom and a pardon for Desmond. Fiach's considerable military capacity, though diminished, was not destroyed and he remained an unpredictable and largely autonomous presence near the centre of English power in Ireland.<br>
<br>In the following years Fiach, watched closely by a suspicious government, kept the peace. In 1584 he renewed his submission to Lord Deputy Perrot and helped Harrington punish thieves who resided within his lands. Fiach posed few problems so long as his sovereignty was respected. By this time he had married a second time, to Rose (<i>c</i>.1558&#150;<i>c</i>.1600), daughter of Fiach O'Toole of Castlekevin. His four known legitimate children, however, were all born to him by Sadhbh. Fiach was the most powerful and prominent member of the O'Byrne clan following the death in 1580 of Dunlang MacEdmund, the last recognized chief of Crioch Branach. Thus it was Fiach whom the government summoned to attend parliament in April 1585 (although he did not sit), and who appeared before the deputy in English apparel in early 1586. Nevertheless Fiach, seated so near to Dublin, remained for successive English officials a glaring example of the failure of Tudor policy. In May 1587 Perrot petitioned the queen for:<blockquote>suche small allowance as heretofore I have requested in that behalf, I truste within one 6 or 8 weekes, to have his hedd or drive him into the sea and settle that parte that it shalbe no more a galle to Leynester. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/129/64)</blockquote>But the campaign against Fiach did not materialize, and it later emerged that Perrot had explored the more inexpensive strategy of having him assassinated. His every move, real or exaggerated, aroused suspicion in Dublin. Ultimately, this led to his downfall.<br>
<br>Even at peace Fiach was a conduit for disaffected elements in Leinster. He harboured known felons&#151;most notably his son-in-law Walter Reagh Fitzgerald&#151;and in 1591 his proximity to Dublin facilitated the escape of both his own pledges and the future O'Donnell chief Hugh Roe. He also intrigued with Spain, although the chances of 5000 Spanish troops appearing in Glenmalure were slender; it was Fiach's virtual independence and penchant to harbour rebels that were an embarrassing reality for the government. Yet the largely independent Gaelic dimension of Fiach's refuge must not be underestimated. Following the Anglicization of the Crioch Branach O'Byrnes and their abandonment of Gaelic chiefly succession, Fiach represented the bulwark of Gaelic culture in the district. This, combined with the autonomy enjoyed in Glenmalure in the face of English cultural and administrative encroachment, allowed for a flowering of Gaelic culture, manifested in poetry and song. Gaelic poets travelled from far and wide to receive the patronage of the last powerful Gaelic chief in Leinster: &#145;Baile na Corra &aacute;r gcuan sealga, seanr&oacute;imh oinigh Innsi N&eacute;ill; beag an t-iongnadh buadh g&aacute; bhuidhnibh, d'iolradh na sluagh suilbhir s&eacute;imh&#146; (TCD, MS 1288, fol. 107b: &#145;Ballinacor is our resort for the chase, ancient sanctuary of Innis-Neill's generosity; such is the multitude of its blithe and accomplished companies that 'tis small wonder though its denizens bear away the palm&#146;).<br>
<br>The inflow of expropriated clansmen and dissident English into such an environment undoubtedly politicized the situation; and in March 1594 Fiach's sons, along with the felon Walter Reagh, burnt to death Sir Pierce Fitzgerald, sheriff of Kildare, and his family at Ardree. In a gesture reminiscent of his father, Fiach disclaimed their actions and later&#151;following the arrival of the new deputy, Sir William Russell&#151;offered submission in return for confirmation of his lands by letters patent. It was, however, too late as Fitzgerald's murder, coupled with an outbreak of hostilities in Ulster, at last forced the government to address the reality of Fiach's autonomy.<h2>
<a name="FiachsslowdestructionandthefailureofTudorpolicy"></a>Fiach's slow destruction and the failure of Tudor policy</h2>Russell, careful to avoid a repeat of the 1580 d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, attacked an unsuspecting Ballinacor in January 1595. Fiach narrowly escaped, but the subsequent garrisoning of Ballinacor limited his manoeuvrability. The senior O'Byrnes supported the deputy, and Fiach's former ally, Hugh Duff O'Byrne, emerged, with government support, as Fiach's internal rival. Russell was determined to crush Fiach so that he might fully devote his energies to the worsening situation in Ulster. Fiach, however, repeatedly eluded capture despite Russell's sustained investment of time, money, and men in the Wicklow Mountains. The capture and execution of Walter Reagh in April 1595 failed to induce Fiach to surrender; but following the capture of his wife, Rose, Fiach surrendered his eldest son Turlough as a pledge for her release and presented himself before the deputy in November. Yet Fiach was not imprisoned (though Turlough was executed), and he successfully petitioned for a full pardon and the restoration of Ballinacor. He was considered a spent force, too old and weak to resume hostilities, and the government was eager to turn its attention towards Ulster.<br>
<br>The agreed pardon, however, did not materialize and the aged Fiach threatened the government through depredations committed by his surviving sons and by negotiations with O'Neill. Communication between Fiach and the Ulster chiefs was by the mid-1590s well established and may have dated back to Baltinglass's rebellion. O'Neill doubtless exploited Fiach's proximity to Dublin, believing him capable of diverting large numbers of government troops away from the Ulster theatre. Fiach, for his part, used the threat of an alliance with O'Neill as a bargaining chip. In truth, co-ordinated military action and the dispatch of thousands of Ulster troops to Glenmalure were no more real than a Spanish landing there. Nevertheless, government preoccupation with Ulster facilitated Fiach's recapture of Ballinacor in September 1596. Russell was enraged and launched the first of several expeditions against Fiach, but once again achieved little save the desolation of much of the district. In January 1597 O'Neill criticized Fiach's persecution, stating that he had been included in a truce concluded between himself and Sir John Norris. Russell, however, disregarded O'Neill's protests and continued the hunt for Fiach. By this point Fiach was militarily broken, Russell frequently entering his country and returning unscathed. This dominance allowed Russell to gain valuable intelligence that revealed Fiach's movements. Thus on Sunday 8 May 1597 Russell's men, doubtless acting on such intelligence, descended upon a virtually unguarded Fiach, probably at a place called Farranerin, and killed him. A sergeant to Captain Lee beheaded him and brought his head to Russell, which, along with his quartered body, was displayed at Dublin Castle. The four masters noted succinctly: &#145;Fiacha mac Aodha mic Seaain o Ghleand Mhaoilugra do thuitim iar ttarraing ceilcce da combrathair fair ar fur&aacute;ileamh ard iust&iacute;r na hereann Sir Uilliam Russel isin ceaid m&iacute; do shamhradh na bliadhna so&#146; (&#145;Fiagh, son of Hugh, son of John from Glenmalure, was slain in the first month of summer in this year, having been treacherously betrayed by his relative at the bidding of the chief justiciary of Ireland, Sir William Russell&#146;; <span class="italic">AFM</span>, <i>sub anno</i> 1597).<br>
<br>Russell reported that the inhabitants of the district rejoiced at the death of their oppressor. Such sentiment, however, was not universal and may represent Russell's own eagerness to secure a propaganda victory. Captain Sir Edward Stanley, worried about the repercussions of Fiach's death, noted &#145;the people heare ther hearts be so hardened towards us that fewe of them rejoyseth at any good ceruice don&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/199/30). The prolonged campaign against Fiach did not bring the district under English control and his sons and followers allied themselves even more closely to O'Neill. In May 1599 Fiach's son and heir Ph&eacute;lim routed a force under Sir Henry Harrington between Ballinacor and Rathdrum, but received a full pardon in 1601, retaining certain Gabhal Raghnaill lands under English law. Thereafter Ph&eacute;lim, accepting the reality of the English conquest, adopted a more co-operative relationship with the government and sought to achieve recognition of his landed claims through English courts. The days of militant Gaelic resistance to English expansion in O'Byrne country ended with the death of Fiach, the failure of Tyrone's rebellion, and the completion of the Tudor conquest.<br>
<br>Contemporary English chroniclers and later English historians ignored the significance of O'Byrne's career, depicting him as a savage thief, mindlessly raiding both his English and Irish neighbours from his mountain refuge. Ironically the preponderance of Irish nationalist historians, bent on correcting such perceived ethnocentrism, similarly ignored Fiach, perhaps regarding him more as an outlaw than a patriot. They concentrated instead on powerful, &#145;legitimate&#146; chiefs geographically further removed from English influence. Only recently, coinciding with the four hundredth anniversary of Fiach's death, have historians begun to re-examine his career. Drawing on a meticulously researched, but largely forgotten, history of Fiach and the O'Byrnes written by Liam Price in the 1930s, a clearer picture of this remarkable figure is emerging, offering a window into a Gaelic culture coping not only with military encroachment, but also with cultural and religious Anglicization emanating from the adjacent pale.<br>
