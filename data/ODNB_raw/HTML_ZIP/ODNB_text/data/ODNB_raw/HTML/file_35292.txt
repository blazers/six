<span class="headword">O'Dwyer, Sir  Michael Francis</span>  (1864&#150;1940), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was the sixth son in the family of fourteen children of John O'Dwyer, a landowner of Barronstown, co. Tipperary; he was born on 28 April 1864. His mother was Margaret, daughter of Patrick Quirk, of Toom, co. Tipperary. He was educated at St Stanislaus College, Tullamore, and passed the open competition for the Indian Civil Service in 1882 and the final examination in 1884. The intervening two years of probation he spent at Balliol College, Oxford, where in a third year he obtained a first class in jurisprudence. Joining the service in India in 1885 he was first posted to Shahpur in the Punjab. He enjoyed the initiative and authority that administrators had traditionally wielded in the Punjab, and rose rapidly in the service. He greatly distinguished himself in land revenue settlement work, and was made director of land records and agriculture in the Punjab (1896); the next year he was placed in charge of the settlements of the Alwar and Bharatpur states. He was a fine rider and sportsman; he was also highly skilled in the vernacular. On 21 November 1896 he married Una Eunice (1872&#150;1956), daughter of Antoine Bord of Castres, France. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>After a long furlough which he spent largely on examination leave in Russia, passing for an interpretership, O'Dwyer was selected by Lord Curzon for a prominent part in the organization of the new North-West Frontier Province and its separation from the Punjab: he was revenue commissioner from 1901 to 1908. From 1908 to 1909 he was acting resident in Hyderabad, and agent to the governor-general in central India from 1910 to 1912. In December 1912, while Lord Hardinge of Penshurst was viceroy, he was appointed to be lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, a post which he held until May 1919.<br>
<br>O'Dwyer's sympathies were with rural India. He was of the paternalist school, believing that Britain's role in India was to bring security and material prosperity, not to encourage the development of politics or democratic institutions. He built good relations with the traditional leaders of Punjab society but alienated the urban groups, especially the educated classes, with his outspoken views. In his pugnacious book, <span class="italic">India as I Knew it, 1885&#150;1925</span> (1925), O'Dwyer explains how the threat of terrorism in the strategically vital Punjab province preoccupied him during his administration. He believed in the importance of nipping such movements in the bud and taking early action to stop the spread of political agitation to the Punjab. The firm measures he took against the revolutionary Ghadr (revolt) movement among Sikh emigrants returning from North America and the Far East averted a very dangerous situation in the early months of the First World War. O'Dwyer was single-minded, dynamic, and skilful in organizing the Punjab for the war effort. The Punjab provided 360,000 recruits, more than half the number provided by the whole of India during the war. By the end of the war one male Punjabi in every twenty-eight had been mobilized. His services were recognized by his appointment as GCIE in 1917; he had been created KCSI in 1913.<br>
<br>Much to O'Dwyer's annoyance, nationalist politicians did not cease their activities for the duration of the war and, indeed, wartime conditions&#151;the demands of recruitment, price inflation, increased government intervention in the economy, and concern about the progress and outcome of the war&#151;alienated many Indians from the government, and won support for a growing home rule movement.<br>
<br>Like many administrators O'Dwyer believed that &#145;extremist&#146; nationalist politics and terrorism were inter-connected. He had been successful in persuading the government of India to bring in a special <span class="roman">Defence of India Act</span> in 1915 to give greater powers to deal with terrorism. However, that act would come to an end with the war, and there was concern that terrorism, especially in Bengal and the Punjab, would resurface. Following a report by Mr Justice Rowlatt, an emergency bill was passed into law as the <span class="roman">Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act</span> in March 1919. This measure was very unpopular and led directly to Gandhi's first nationwide <i>satyagraha</i> (non-violent resistance) in protest. Despite Gandhi's wishes, the movement resulted in violence in some parts of India, the worst taking place in the Punjab where O'Dwyer took strong measures to counteract it. In some areas the situation became critical, and there was a fear of widespread rebellion against British rule. At Amritsar on 13 April, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32947/', "Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer")</script> ordered his troops to fire on a very large crowd assembled in a walled area known as the Jallianwalla Bagh. More than 300 people were killed and more than 1000 wounded, according to British estimates, but Dyer did not wait to treat the wounded or to count his victims. It is likely that the casualties were considerably higher. O'Dwyer was not alone among British officials in initially giving his support to Dyer, based on the rather limited information he received on the circumstances. However, he staked his reputation in the coming months and years by backing Dyer, even when fuller information about the scale of the killings, and the fact that Dyer had used the shooting to create a &#145;moral and widespread&#146; effect among the people of the Punjab, became available.<br>
<br>O'Dwyer was himself in the thick of the action in Lahore: it was his decision to expel two Indian political leaders, Kitchlew and Satyapal, from Amritsar that triggered the violence. He clearly believed that firm action had averted a widespread rebellion in north India, which might have been supported by an Afghan invasion. His decision to implement martial law in some parts of the Punjab was controversial, and some of the punishments meted out by the military were excessive and designed to humiliate communities rather than to punish individuals. O'Dwyer argued that he could not be held responsible for what took place under martial law, as the government of India had refused his request to maintain control of martial law administration, apart from the purely military operations. In the circumstances, he had used his influence where appropriate to control any excesses. There can, however, be no doubt that O'Dwyer was responsible for the orders given for an aeroplane to restore order in and around the town of Gujranwala. In the bombing and machine-gunning that ensued at least a dozen people were killed, including children. These appalling events coincided with O'Dwyer's intended retirement, which was now delayed until May 1919. He left the Punjab still popular among the traditional &eacute;lites, but vilified by the rising political classes, whose views O'Dwyer had completely failed to understand or even consider. Ironically, his actions proved to be one of the most significant factors in the rapid rise of mass nationalism in India under Gandhi's leadership.<br>
<br>The controversy over events in the Punjab in 1919 continued for several years. The Hunter committee which inquired into the causes and handling of the disturbances was highly critical of Reginald Dyer, whose military career was now ended. The committee was divided along racial lines on the broader question of whether the situation in the Punjab justified the implementation of martial law. The secretary of state for India, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35074/', "Edwin Montagu")</script>, was highly critical of O'Dwyer's methods, and had to be constrained by his colleagues from expressing his views publicly. O'Dwyer himself felt that the Hunter committee had neither been representative in its personnel nor fair in its conclusions; he believed that Dyer had been condemned without a proper army hearing. His chance to justify his viewpoint came in 1922 when Sir Sankaran Nair published a book entitled <span class="italic">Gandhi and Anarchy</span> which O'Dwyer believed libelled him. The majority of the jury in the ensuing trial before Lord Justice McCardie found in O'Dwyer's favour, and damages of &pound;500 were awarded.<br>
<br>O'Dwyer served on the Esher committee on the administration of the army in India (1919&#150;20). He often wrote letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on Indian affairs in which he argued the case for continued British control in India, and was dismayed by the failure to tackle the Gandhian non-co-operation movement more firmly. He had opposed the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford constitutional reforms of 1919 while he was lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, and continued to do so in his retirement. He was an important contributor to &#145;die-hard&#146; opposition to both the 1919 and the 1935 reforms, and continued to state his opinions with frankness and courage. In the end he paid with his life, for on 13 March 1940 at a meeting of the Royal Central Asian Society at Caxton Hall in London he was shot at close range by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73200/', "Udham Singh")</script>. O'Dwyer's injuries were fatal and he died in Caxton Hall. Udham Singh was tried, convicted, and hanged for the offence. O'Dwyer was survived by his wife, who had been made DBE in 1919, and their children.<br>
