<span class="headword">V&eacute;ron,  Jean</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">religious writer and translator and Church of England clergyman</span>, was probably born at or near Sens, for he called himself &#145;senonoys&#146;; nothing is known about his date of birth or about his family or private life. No record of V&eacute;ron's life in France has been found, but it has been suggested that he may have attended the University of Orl&eacute;ans in 1534. He emigrated to England <i>c</i>.1536 and became a denizen in July 1544. By then he had been in the country for over eight years, living in Aldrichgate ward, and acting as a teacher of gentlemen's children. The record also states that he had been a student at Cambridge at some point during those eight years, but no evidence of his matriculation has come to light. Although there is no proof of his protestant faith until 1548, V&eacute;ron probably left France for religious reasons, making him one of the first French protestant refugees in England. Perhaps because he had already been in the country so long V&eacute;ron did not join the group of foreigners who formed their own French and Dutch Reformed congregations in 1550.<br>
<br>On 21 August 1551 V&eacute;ron was ordained deacon by Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London. Eight days later he received priest's orders, and on 3 January 1553 he became the rector of St Alphage, Cripplegate. He did not flee to the continent upon the accession of the Catholic queen, Mary I; indeed, he was one of the &#145;seditious preachers&#146; arrested by Marian authorities in the wake of a riot at St Paul's on 13 August 1553. It is unknown how he managed to escape execution. John Strype's puzzling reference to him as a &#145;confessor also under Queen Mary&#146; suggests he may have temporarily converted to Catholicism  (Strype, <span class="italic">Reformation</span>, 1/2.1) but there is no primary evidence to justify this claim. During Elizabeth's reign he became the vicar of St Martin Ludgate and Christ Church Greyfriars, and a prebendary of St Paul's. He preached regularly at St Paul's and Whitehall; Strype calls him a &#145;bold as well as eloquent man&#146;  (ibid., 1/1.200) and &#145;one of the eminentest preachers at this time&#146;  (ibid., 1/2.1). His boldness seems to have inspired enmity in the diarist Henry Machyn: Machyn was forced, on 23 November 1561, to kneel in front of V&eacute;ron and ask his forgiveness for shouting out at a sermon that V&eacute;ron kept a wench.<br>
<br>Throughout his career V&eacute;ron translated and wrote books which advanced protestant belief and practice and criticized Catholicism, his intention being to instruct the &#145;rude and simple people&#146; in the tenets of the new faith  (preface to H. Bullinger, <span class="italic">An Holsome Antidotus or Counterpoysen, Agaynst &hellip; the Anabaptists</span>, 1548, sig. A4<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). During the reign of Edward VI he was responsible for the publication of two tracts by Huldrych Zwingli, the leader of the Reformation in Z&uuml;rich; three by Zwingli's successor, Heinrich Bullinger; a treatise of his own against the mass; and a compilation of patristic opinions on the Lord's supper. In the preface to Zwingli's <span class="italic">The Image of both Pastors</span> V&eacute;ron makes explicit his hope that his &#145;little book&#146; will serve as a temporary substitute for the lack of godly preaching in many parishes in England  (preface to H. Zwingli, <span class="italic">The Image of both Pastors</span>, 1550, sig. B2<i>v</i>). In these works V&eacute;ron not only made continental protestant doctrine available to English readers, but he also explained in his own words how and why the material was relevant to England.<br>
<br>In 1552 V&eacute;ron issued a version of the French humanist Robert &Eacute;tienne's French and Latin dictionary, adding English entries to make it a trilingual lexicon; this dictionary went through two more editions during the Elizabethan period. Also during Elizabeth's reign V&eacute;ron published a series of dialogues in which Philalethes (lover of truth) leads Albion (England gone astray under Catholicism) back to protestant doctrine on predestination, purgatory, free will, justification by works, invocation of the saints, and clerical celibacy. The dialogue against purgatory is an English adaptation of several dialogues on the subject by the Calvinist author Pierre Viret; the rest of the dialogues appear to be original to V&eacute;ron. In a humorous, highly persuasive style he asserted these protestant doctrines by attacking both Catholicism and Anabaptism, a tactic which had been successful for reformers on the continent and in England during the reign of Edward VI.<br>
<br>V&eacute;ron died in London on 9 April 1563 and was buried the next day. It has been stated  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) that he was buried at St Paul's in an unmarked grave, but the evidence for this is unclear. John Awdelie wrote an epitaph in verse which praised the Frenchman's dedication to England and to the protestant faith.<br>
