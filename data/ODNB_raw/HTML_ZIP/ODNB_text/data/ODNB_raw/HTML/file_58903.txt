<span class="headword">Watkins,  Vernon Phillips</span>  (1906&#150;1967), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 27 June 1906 at Lloyds Bank House, Talbot Street, in the mining town of Maesteg, in the Llynfi valley, Glamorgan, the second of the three children of William Watkins (1872&#150;1949), bank manager, and his wife, Sarah (1876&#150;1975), daughter of James Phillips of Sarnau, Carmarthenshire. His maternal grandfather, a devoted Congregationalist, came from a family which owned land in Carmarthenshire; towards the end of his life he lived at Goleufryn in Picton Terrace, Carmarthen, a house celebrated in his grandson's poem &#145;Returning to Goleufryn&#146;. Both Watkins's parents were Welsh-speaking but, in the fashion of their time and class, they did not pass the language on to their children; of Welsh literary tradition Watkins, as a mature poet, was able to use only the legendary figure of Taliesin in the setting of his beloved Gower peninsula. Two years after their son's birth the family moved back to Bridgend, Glamorgan, where William Watkins had been based, and made their home at Quarella, a house (demolished during the 1970s) on the outskirts of the town. Watkins's father belonged to a Brecknockshire family which had settled in Gwaelod-y-Garth, a village just north of Cardiff. (On 31 December 1938 Watkins listened to a radio programme, broadcast from the village, about the Welsh folk-custom of the Mari Lwyd, a form of wassailing, which he used as the basis for a long poem.) In 1912 the Watkins family left Bridgend for Llanelli, in Carmarthenshire, and, after about a year, moved to Swansea, where William Watkins took charge of the Wind Street branch of Lloyds Bank, a post in which he remained until his retirement twenty-three years later. For the first ten of these the family lived in Eaton Grove (later part of Eaton Crescent) in the Uplands area of the town.<br>
<br>In 1916, at the age of ten, Vernon Watkins entered Swansea grammar school but was not to meet its most famous pupil, Dylan Thomas, who was eight years younger, until 1935. At the age of eleven he was sent by his socially ambitious parents to Tyttenhanger Lodge, a preparatory school in Seaford, Sussex, and then in 1920 to Repton School in Derbyshire. At Repton, where the headmaster was Dr G. F. Fisher (later archbishop of Canterbury), he was confirmed into the Anglican church, which he never thereafter left. A dreamy, shy, and gentle lad already preoccupied with the inner life of the poet, and with aesthetic notions inspired by Rupert Brooke, he was regularly bullied by older boys, but as a sixth-former won a degree of popularity by excelling at tennis and cricket. In June 1924 he was awarded the Howe verse prize, the Lancelot Saye prizes for French and German, and the Schreiber prize for prowess in those languages. For Repton's quatercentenary in 1957 he wrote a sequence of poems entitled &#145;Revisited Waters&#146; which, though almost totally lacking in autobiographical detail, recalled the idyllic nature of his last eighteen months at the school and made it clear that, for him, poetry was the only shield he had against impermanence, one of the major themes of his writing. In its terminal letter of May 1968, after Watkins's death, the school referred to him, somewhat cautiously, as &#145;perhaps the best poet Repton has had&#146;.<br>
<br>Watkins entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in October 1924, to read modern languages. But although his academic results at the end of his first year were satisfactory, he found the college a grave disappointment, particularly in its emphasis on language and criticism at the expense of literature. In a heated interview he told the master, A. C. Benson, that his only interest was in writing poetry; when Benson expressed scorn for this declaration, Watkins immediately left the college. This rash decision was to cause him great unhappiness. His father would not allow him to go for a year's stay in Italy, and, in the autumn of 1925, he became a junior clerk in the Butetown branch of Lloyds Bank in Cardiff, and took lodgings at 73 Connaught Road.<br>
<br>Two years later, deeply depressed by his daily routine, and yearning for the Arcadian life of Repton, Watkins suffered the first phase of a nervous breakdown after witnessing an accident in the street outside his lodgings for which he felt he was somehow to blame. He returned to Repton the next day, visited such boys as still remembered him, attended chapel, and then burst into Dr Fisher's study, accused him of &#145;destroying youth&#146;, tried ineffectually to assault him, and was taken to a nursing home in Derby. This crisis brought about what Watkins called &#145;a revolution of sensibility&#146;. From that point on his life's work would be preoccupied with &#145;the conquest of Time&#146;, by which he meant the immortalization of his memories of Repton and the validation of all that he had known and loved there. After convalescence, he returned to his parents' home in Gower. In due course his father was able to arrange for his transfer to the St Helen's branch of Lloyds Bank in Swansea, so that he could live at home, and it was there that he was to spend the rest of his career as &#145;the oldest cashier at Lloyds&#146;.<br>
<br>Watkins's first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Ballad of the Mari Lwyd</span>, appeared in 1941 after he had left the bombed town of Swansea for service in the RAF police. When Philip Larkin heard him lecture in Oxford in 1943 Watkins wore a flight sergeant's stripes and was billeted at New Bradwell, Buckinghamshire. On 2 October 1944, at St Bartholomew-the-Great in London, he married Gwendoline Mary Davies (<i>b</i>. 1923) of Harborne, Birmingham, whom he had met at Bletchley where they both had been working in RAF Intelligence; Dylan Thomas was to have been the bridegroom's best man, but failed to turn up for the ceremony. The Watkinses made their home first on Glanmor Hill in the Uplands area of Swansea, then at The Garth, Pennard Cliffs; they had four sons and a daughter. In her memoir <span class="italic">Portrait of a Friend</span> (1983), Gwen Watkins gave an account of her husband's relationship with Dylan Thomas, whom he loved unreservedly (but not erotically), even after Thomas had died, and whom she described as &#145;the most important person in his life&#146;; Thomas's letters to Watkins were published in 1957.<br>
<br>Among Watkins's books of poetry published during his lifetime were <span class="italic">The Lamp and the Veil</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Lady with the Unicorn</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The North Sea</span> (translations from Heinrich Heine, 1951), <span class="italic">The Death Bell</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Cypress and Acacia</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">Affinities</span> (1962). His <span class="italic">Fidelities</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Uncollected Poems</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Selected Verse Translations</span> (1977), <span class="italic">The Breaking of the Wave</span> (1979), <span class="italic">The Ballad of the Outer Dark</span> (1979), and several selections, all appeared posthumously. His poetry is formal, highly crafted, metaphysical, and unorthodox in its Christianity, but relentless in its symbolism and its emphasis on the role of the poet and the immortal nature of his art. Watkins was intransigent in his opposition to any exegesis of his work and did not expect recognition during his lifetime. A memorial volume edited by Leslie Norris was published in 1970 and his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> appeared in 1986.<br>
<br>Shortly after his retirement from the bank in 1966 Watkins was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Wales and was a Gulbenkian scholar at the University College of Swansea. At the time of his death in Seattle, during a second visit as professor of poetry at the University of Washington, his name was being canvassed, with others, for the poet laureateship left vacant by the death of John Masefield. He died of a heart attack on the university's tennis court on 8 October 1967, after a two-hour game of doubles; his ashes were buried in the churchyard of St Mary, at Pennard, near Swansea, where a memorial was erected to him.<br>
