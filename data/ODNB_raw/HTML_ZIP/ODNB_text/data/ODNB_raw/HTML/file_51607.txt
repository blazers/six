<span class="headword">Witchell,  George</span>  (1728&#150;1785), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born at Birchin Lane, London, on 27 January 1728, the youngest of six children of Nicholas Witchell (1686&#150;1761), a glover, and his wife, Elizabeth (1687?&#150;1764), daughter of George Wass, members of the Society of Friends. In 1734 Nicholas Witchell moved to St Giles Cripplegate, where he opened a shop. Falling on hard times in later years, he applied to the Friends meeting in this area for relief, alleging prosecution for non-payment of tithes, but had to fight his case for seven years before he was accepted as a resident and given relief.<br>
<br>According to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, Witchell was descended on his mother's side from the renowned Quaker clockmaker Daniel Quare, and had been brought up to that trade. No evidence has been found to support this, although a John Witchell was apprenticed to a master of the same name in the Clockmakers' Company in 1742. It is not known where he was educated, but he claimed to have taught mathematics for many years in London. His first article on astronomy appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentlemen's Diary</span> for 1741; thereafter he published frequently in the <span class="italic">Gentlemen's Diary</span> and <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, over his name or the initials G. W.<br>
<br>Disenchantment with the treatment meted out to his father may have soured Witchell's relationship with the Friends and led to his marriage to a non-Quaker. When this was investigated by the Friends they reported on 26 November 1755 that &#145;he acquainted 'em he did not look upon Himself as a Member of the Society, which he requested they would inform the Meeting of, neither would he be accountable for his Conduct to them&#146;  (Peel MM, minutes, 26 Nov 1755).<br>
<br>In 1764 Witchell published a map of the passage of the moon's shadow over England during the eclipse of 1 April 1764, and in the same year the board of longitude engaged him, with John Campbell RN and John Bevis, to compute the difference in longitude between the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth and Nevil Maskelyne's observatory in Barbados. The following year Witchell and Israel Lyons the younger were engaged on astronomical computations for the first six months of 1767, destined for what became the first <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span>. Witchell's paper, &#145;Calculations to explain the duration of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites due to Jupiter's oblate shape&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1767, led to his election as fellow of the Royal Society in July that year.<br>
<br>The Royal Naval Academy had opened in 1733 in Portsmouth Dockyard to instruct boys aged eleven to seventeen prior to their going to sea but it later acquired a bad reputation for the unruly behaviour of the students. In 1766 the head and his assistant were dismissed, and on 26 March 1767 Witchell was appointed head mathematical master, at a salary of &pound;150, with John Bradley as his assistant. This move did not halt the academy's decline, although Witchell's own reputation was undamaged. Captain James Cook, returning in 1775 from his second voyage, sought Witchell's help in checking his chronometers at the academy's observatory; Witchell also checked the reduction of Cook's eclipse observations. The explorer's son, James Cook junior, aged eleven, was a student at the academy in 1774. During their years at the academy Witchell and Bradley also instructed masters on the taking of lunar observations. Witchell's will, made in 1777, reveals that his wife, whose name is not given, had died earlier, and that he desired to be buried alongside her in Kingston churchyard, at St Mary's, Portsea. His estate was to be divided equally between his six surviving children, Thomas (who was old enough to be named as his executor), John, Mary, Ann, Sarah, and Elizabeth. Witchell died on 29 January 1785, according to the probate, still teaching at the academy. He was buried at St Mary's on 5 February.<br>
