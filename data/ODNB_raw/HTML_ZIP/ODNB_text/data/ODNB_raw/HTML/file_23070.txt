<span class="headword">Ramsay family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;1513), <span class="occ">landowners</span>, was prominent locally in Fife, Lothian, and the borders, and intermittently important in national affairs. Sir William Ramsay of Dalhousie, Edinburghshire, swore fealty to Edward I in 1296 for his Lothian and Berwickshire lands. Thereafter the allegiances of family members fluctuated during the Anglo-Scottish wars; survival in disturbed conditions, if not great advancement, was achieved. National prominence was achieved by <a name="cosubject_23069"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1342)<span class="occ"></span>, a highly successful border warrior in the 1330s and early 1340s. Ramsay was heavily involved in eroding the English occupation of southern Scotland and in a series of successful Scottish military operations against the Balliol faction and its English supporters. This included participation in the battle of Culblean in Aberdeenshire in 1335, an encounter that saw Edward Balliol's chief northern supporter, David Strathbogie, earl of Atholl, defeated and killed. Among many actions in the more familiar terrain of the eastern borders Ramsay's most important intervention was perhaps his relief by sea of the besieged garrison of Dunbar Castle in 1338, an achievement vital in ensuring the successful defence of an important Scottish border stronghold. These high-profile incidents are in a sense untypical, though, of Ramsay's military career. His regular mode of operation was as a guerrilla leader, continually harassing the English presence in southern Scotland with a relatively small armed retinue, which at one time had its base in a network of fortified caves.<br>
<br>One reward for Ramsay's military success was the renown of being regarded, according to Scottish accounts, as a paragon of chivalry. A genuine attachment to the chivalric ethos is certainly suggested by the jousts in which he led the Scots against a party of English knights under Henry of Grosmont, the future duke of Lancaster, at Berwick early in 1342, in which four of the participants were killed. But Ramsay, initially a relatively minor Lothian laird, also gained rewards more tangible than high contemporary esteem. In 1340 he was made warden of the east march, confirming his status as the chief war leader of the region. In 1342, moreover, he captured the powerful fortress of Roxburgh from the English. Now in possession of the castle that dominated the area, Ramsay was made sheriff of Teviotdale by David II, an appointment which recognized the extension of Ramsay's influence into the central borders. These developments, though, marked an encroachment on the territorial interests of the other greatly successful Scottish border warlord of the era, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale. At the height of his power Ramsay was seized by Douglas at Hawick in the central borders in June 1342, removed to the castle of Hermitage in Liddesdale, and starved to death. Ramsay's demise was not lightly accepted by his followers: in 1344 the Scottish parliament was still trying to prevent the Ramsay kindred from seeking revenge for the murder. The Dalhousie Ramsays would never again reach the heights of status that Sir Alexander had achieved. His illustrious career did, though, provide an imposing example of military endeavour and local leadership for his peers and future generations of the family. Ramsays were frequently involved in Anglo-Scottish warfare from Sir Alexander's time onwards, and as important aristocrats of the region they directed their ecclesiastical patronage firmly towards the Cistercian house of Newbattle, Edinburghshire.<br>
<br>It was a member of a Fife-based cadet branch of the family, <a name="cosubject_23099"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Ramsay of Colluthie</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1382)<span class="occ"></span>, who next rose to prominence in national affairs. Ramsay of Colluthie, a minor laird, shared the developing family penchant for warfare. He was one of four Ramsays captured at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346. It was probably Colluthie also who took a retinue of ten on pilgrimage in the company of the future earl of Douglas in 1356, and fought at Poitiers in that year. These and other military ventures no doubt endeared Ramsay to David II, whose inner circle of retainers was a group of knights with shared chivalric leanings. Royal favour certainly propelled Ramsay from minor landed status into the top rank of the aristocracy in 1358 when David II awarded him the vacant earldom of Fife, in disregard of the rights of its heiress, Isabella. Magnate opposition to such flouting of rank, led by Robert the Steward (subsequently Robert II), resulted in 1359/60 in Ramsay's losing the earldom, which passed briefly to the Steward's family when Isabella married Robert's son Walter. Despite this setback Ramsay continued to prosper in the service of David II, and served as steward of the royal household in the later years of the reign. Ramsay's national prominence came to an end when his royal patron died suddenly in 1371, although his career appears to have stretched into the early 1380s.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the Dalhousie Ramsays remained prominent in Lothian and the borders, and in warfare. <a name="cosubject_23070"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402)<span class="occ"></span> fought at the battle of Otterburn in 1388; his seat of Dalhousie was targeted during the invasion of Scotland by Henry IV in 1400; and he fought, along with two other Ramsays, and was killed at Homildon Hill on 14 September 1402. His grandson, also <a name="cosubject_23071"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1465)<span class="occ"></span>, who was knighted at James I's coronation in 1424, was one commander of a force which defeated a major English raid at Piperdean in 1435, and was appointed to the border office of conservitor of the truce in 1451. The experience of the Ramsay family was ultimately one of moderate success amid the opportunities and dangers of regular warfare in lowland Scotland. A family tradition of militarism and local leadership developed, but the rewards of this rarely seem to have been outstanding after the mid-fourteenth century. Ramsay bellicosity can be seen as very much in the mainstream of European aristocratic behaviour, albeit tinged with the specifically Scottish edge of entrenched opposition to the English enemy. Unsurprisingly, a later Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie was killed at Flodden in 1513.<br>
