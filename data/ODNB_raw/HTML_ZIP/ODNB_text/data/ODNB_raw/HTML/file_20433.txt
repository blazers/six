<span class="headword">Oakman,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1748&#150;1793), <span class="occ">engraver and writer of songs and novels</span>, was born at Hendon, Middlesex. He received a grammar-school education and was apprenticed to the map engraver Emanuel Bowen. He left before completing his indenture, having proved troublesome to his master; furthermore, he seduced Bowen's daughter, whom he married when he came of age. Oakman next opened a shop in the Haymarket with Darley and Harry Howard in order to sell their caricatures and humorous prints; he supplemented his income by writing bawdy novels, for which he also cut plates. <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Benjamin Brass</span> (1765), based in part on Oakman's own early career, was rapidly followed by others of the kind. <span class="italic">The Adventures of William Williams, an African Prince</span> emerged from his getting to know Williams in Liverpool gaol (for undefined misdeeds); the book enjoyed some contemporary success, especially among the Quakers, for its attack on the institution of slavery.<br>
<br>Equally prolific and more successful as a songwriter, Oakman was credited with many of the pieces sung at Vauxhall Gardens and Bermondsey Spa, and with others of a moral character for children; in addition he published collections of fables. Having travelled on foot throughout England and Wales, he had a fund of droll stories to relate about his experiences. His poverty was relieved from time to time by Christopher Anstey, author of <span class="italic">The Bath Guide</span>, by Anstey's father, and by a Mr Hughes for whom he wrote burlettas. Oakman's dislike of the settled life prevented his living in the comfort his songwriting might have afforded him. He died in October 1793 at the house of his sister, who kept a butcher's shop in one of the several King streets in Westminster, and was buried at Holy Trinity Minories.<br>
