</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lovelace,  John</span>, third Baron Lovelace  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1693), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of John Lovelace, second Baron Lovelace (1615/16&#150;1670), and his wife, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1623, <i>d</i>. 1697), third daughter and ultimately coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29058/', "Thomas Wentworth, earl of Cleveland")</script>. His father supported the royalist cause during the English civil wars, much to his financial detriment, and subsequently served as lord lieutenant of Berkshire from the Restoration until 1668. His mother was the Lady Anne to whom Richard Lovelace dedicated his poem <span class="italic">Lucasta</span>.<br>
<br>Lovelace matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 25 July 1655 (the same year that his father was briefly incarcerated in the Tower of London on suspicion of plotting against the government) and was created MA on 9 September 1661. He married Martha Pye (<i>c</i>.1642&#150;1704?), the eldest daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Pye, baronet, of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire, on 28 August 1662. Their only son died an infant; of three daughters&#151;Anne, Martha, and Catherine&#151;only Martha survived her father. She subsequently succeeded to the title of Baroness Wentworth upon the death of Lovelace's mother, while the Lovelace title passed to a collateral male heir, <a href="#cosubject_17055">John Lovelace [<i>see below</i>]</a>, at the time of her father's death.<h2>
<a name="Countryandwhigpolitician"></a>Country and whig politician</h2>Returned to the House of Commons in 1661 as one of the members for Berkshire, Lovelace's opposition to the hearth tax (which extended outside the house as far as beating up a collector) attracted a reference by Andrew Marvell in his &#145;Last instructions to a painter&#146; (1667). In 1667 Lovelace was a teller against the bill imposing double taxation on nonconformists. Otherwise he seems not to have distinguished himself in the Commons and, notwithstanding these policy stands, both in 1664 and later in 1669&#150;71 he was noted as a court dependent and supporter. After the death of his father in 1670, however, Lovelace took his seat in the House of Lords and by the end of the 1670s he had emerged as a leading whig partisan. In 1675 he was one of the country peers who voted against the government's attempt to impose an oath on all peers, MPs, and office-holders to forswear any attempt to alter the government of church or state. Two years later he was one of the two country peers who, like the duke of York (the future James II) and his supporters, dissented from the government's bill to impose limitations on a Catholic successor, but for very different reasons to theirs: to Lovelace, the bill provided too weak a bulwark against what a Catholic monarch could do.<br>
<br>Lovelace was an active participant in the upper chamber's continuing investigation of the Popish Plot in 1678 and 1679. At the local level, Anthony Wood reported sourly his success at influencing the election of whig burgesses at Oxford (and elsewhere) to the exclusion parliaments. Made a freeman of Oxford in the summer of 1680, Lovelace further scandalized Wood by drinking a health to the king at the entertainment that followed, and then, in a deliberate insult to the duke of York, a second health to the confusion of all popish princes. In September of the same year he arranged for the duke of Monmouth to visit Oxford, an occasion studiously ignored by the university community and the bishop of Oxford but one which prompted a considerable popular response. &#145;My Lord Lovelace&#146;, according to one report, &#145;rode all about the town shouting &hellip; he was for a Protestant Duke, no Papist, and God damn him, he was for the Protestant religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 5.449). Lovelace was also a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>. Not surprisingly, tokens of royal displeasure multiplied over these years. In 1679 he lost his place as steward of Woodstock manor and park, to which he responded by inviting Titus Oates to preach there twice while attending the horse races as his guest. In 1680 he was removed from the commissions of the peace for both Berkshire and Oxfordshire and then two years later he was dropped from the deputy lieutenancy of Berkshire.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Lovelace's political views, and perhaps also his outlook on religion, were shaped in his early youth by John Owen, the prominent Independent minister who had served as his father's chaplain. If so this would have depended on continuing links between Owen and the Lovelaces, as the clergyman had moved on from his chaplaincy when Lovelace was only a small child. The most that can be proved is that Lovelace had connections with the nonconformist leadership in Berkshire and Oxfordshire during the exclusion crisis, and that he continued to meet with Owen and others even after the dissolution of the third Exclusion Parliament in March 1681, with a view to preparing a suitable slate of candidates in case new elections were held. Such planning came to nothing after the revelations of the Rye House plot rapidly transformed the political landscape, and in early July 1683 Lovelace found himself briefly incarcerated in the Tower of London at the same time that William, Lord Russell, and a number of other whig extremists were arrested on charges of having participated in the plan to assassinate Charles II and his brother. Certainly Lovelace's penchant for political provocation was sufficient to have raised suspicions, but even in the charged atmosphere of the moment no solid evidence against him could be found. Released on bail after an appearance before the council, Lovelace was hardly intimidated by this brush with royal authority and was again in the newsletters in 1684 having tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to persuade both Oxford and Reading not to surrender their charters.<h2>
<a name="Therevolutionof1688"></a>The revolution of 1688</h2>His earlier support for Monmouth notwithstanding, Lovelace steered clear of any involvement in that duke's futile rebellion. However, his name subsequently appears on almost every list of those opposed to the policies of James II and, later, of those peers of the realm who might be expected to countenance a movement against the king. In February 1688 he again found himself hauled before the council, this time accused of telling some constables that they need not obey Roman Catholic justices of the peace. According to Lord Macaulay's version of the incident, Lovelace was closely examined but managed to extricate himself from trouble, although not before James personally taxed him severely for playing political tricks. Lovelace's record of rash behaviour and his reputation as a whig extremist probably account for the fact that he was not included in the early network of contacts established by the prince of Orange, but he was finally drawn into the conspiracy against James shortly after the die was cast by the dispatch of the invitation to William in late June. Tradition has it that, in a series of meetings held in the cellars of his house at Hurley, Lovelace plotted his part in the uprisings to occur when William landed. More certain is the fact that his high tolerance for risk was put to good use when he served as courier for a final round of messages from the prince to his associates in England. To this end, Lovelace left for the continent early in September, travelling on an official pass permitting him to go abroad to take the waters. Although a warrant for his arrest as an abetter of the prince was issued just after he returned at the end of the month, he successfully managed to drop out of sight.<br>
<br>Within a week after William landed at Torbay&#151;well before most of the other principal conspirators were in motion&#151;Lovelace gathered a party of some fifty horse made up of tenants and neighbours. From a staging point at Woodstock the group moved on to Cirencester to spend the night of 12 November, but there it encountered a detachment of militia horse sent out by the duke of Beaufort, perhaps the only lord lieutenant actually to make some effort to block supporters from reaching the prince. In one of the few violent encounters in England of the &#145;bloodless&#146; revolution, a confused skirmish ensued during which the commander of the militia unit and his son were killed and Lovelace and several of his followers arrested; a few days later they were taken under close guard to Gloucester Castle. News of the affair circulated quickly and widely, with Lovelace's fate becoming a matter of some concern to both James and William at a point in time when many had yet to decide whether to take an active role in the events unfolding or, in some cases, which way to jump. According to the earl of Clarendon, James was anxious to have Lovelace sent to Salisbury, presumably so that an example could then be made of what would happen to anyone taking up arms against the king. William is also supposed to have made vigorous efforts to secure his release or at least to guarantee his personal safety, including a threat to burn Badminton as a way to put pressure on the duke of Beaufort. In the end Lovelace was freed by an advance party of troops accompanying Lord Delamer and the earl of Stamford on their march south to join the prince. James having long since withdrawn to London, it was apparently decided that Lovelace should take a party of men and occupy Oxford in anticipation of the arrival of Princess Anne and the sizeable force escorting her south from Nottingham. On 5 December Lovelace entered the city at the head of some 200 horse and was welcomed by the mayor and council and, with the writing on the wall, by the university community as well.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In the Convention Parliament, Lovelace was a strong proponent of declaring the throne vacant and William and Mary king and queen, and he was suspected by Clarendon of having incited popular protests to accelerate the political process. Once the new regime was settled in, Lovelace was rewarded for his efforts almost immediately by appointment as captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners, a position that carried an annual stipend of &pound;1000 and, more to the point, was sufficiently important to please Lovelace but also keep him well removed from the front lines of administration. He was also named chief justice in eyre of royal parks and forests south of Trent, a post largely without function but one with a variety of perquisites to supplement the annual salary of &pound;165. That same spring a regiment of foot was raised in his name to be sent to Ireland, but it was poorly officered and organized from the first and was disbanded within less than a year. Both in 1689 and 1690 Lovelace was active in the House of Lords, taking an interest in legislation intended to improve the lot of dissenters, to protect the rights of peers, and generally to set right the wrongs of the past decade. As the record of his protests reveal, he not infrequently ended up voting with a small minority of the more radical whigs when it came to matters such as the attempt to pass a bill reversing the 1685 conviction of Titus Oates for perjury or abolishing the strictures of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> for the benefit of the protestant nonconformists.<br>
<br>Although he cut a dashing figure during his time, Lovelace's political extravagance and flaws of character were such that neither contemporary chroniclers nor more recent commentators have always treated him kindly. Elias Ashmole used the phrase &#145;vitae virtutis degener heres&#146; (&#145;a moral degenerate, you cling to a life of virtue&#146;) to signal his conflicted view of this intemperate whig partisan who almost certainly was an alcoholic as well as a compulsive gambler and given to sexual excess  (Ashmole, 2.478). Thomas Hearne weighs in with the opinion that he was &#145;a Man of good natural parts, but of very ill and very loose principle&#146;  (T. Hearne, <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, ed. C. E. Doble, 3, 1889, 349). Hearne then goes on to report hearsay to the effect that Lovelace was rarely sober, a point echoed on more than one occasion by Narcissus Luttrell and other observers of the period. Certainly Lovelace wasted whatever remained of his patrimony, and after his death the estate at Hurley was sold for &pound;41,000 by order of the court of chancery to help pay off accumulated debts. In spite of his personal failings, however, it would be a mistake to dismiss Lovelace as no more than a Restoration rake. He contributed significantly to one extreme in the political dialogue of the period, used his personal popularity and public flair effectively to rally support for the whig cause before and during the revolution of 1688, and played a role of some substance in the overthrow of James II. Only in the year or two before he died in London on 27 September 1693 did his personal habits and declining health overwhelm all capacity for effective action. He died at Lincoln's Inn Fields and he was buried at Hurley on 6 October 1693.<h2>
<a name="JohnLovelacefourthBaronLovelace"></a>John Lovelace, fourth Baron Lovelace</h2>Lovelace was succeeded in the peerage by a second cousin, another <a name="cosubject_17055"></a><span class="headword">John Lovelace</span>, fourth Baron Lovelace  (<em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator</span>. He was the son and heir of William Lovelace (<i>d</i>. 1676) of Hurst, Berkshire, and grandson of Francis Lovelace, the second son of the first baron. His mother, Mary, was the sister and co-heir of Sir Edward Nevill, baronet, of Grove, Nottinghamshire. A chance contemporary reference suggests a birth date sometime during the decade before his father's death in 1676. About 20 October 1702 Lovelace married Charlotte Clayton (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of Sir John Clayton of Richmond, Surrey. The couple had four children: three sons&#151;John, Nevill, and Charles&#151;and a daughter, Martha.<br>
<br>Lovelace inherited little but a title from his cousin and was reputed to be of relatively modest means himself. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 November 1693 but was not very active politically. None the less, the family's whig connection was sufficiently strong to secure him a series of appointments in the military, starting in the Life Guards in 1699 and then as colonel of his own regiment of foot in 1706. Two years later Lovelace was appointed governor of New York and New Jersey as replacement for Lord Cornbury, an administrator singularly deficient in talent and much disliked. (Lovelace was, incidentally, no relation of the Francis Lovelace who had served as governor of New York some forty years earlier.) He first arrived in the New World in the late autumn of 1708 after a difficult transatlantic crossing. He adopted a conciliatory stance with his constituents, even allowing the assemblies in both colonies for the first time to make specific appropriations of tax revenues rather than simply delivering up a lump sum to the governor. However, his death from a stroke on 6 May 1709 cut short Lovelace's administrative career at too early a stage for there to be a record of significant accomplishment or any challenge to his initial popularity. Six days later, after a funeral at Trinity Church, New York, Lovelace was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
