<span class="headword">White,  William</span>  (1807&#150;1882), <span class="occ">printer, and door-keeper of the House of Commons</span>, was born of East Anglian nonconformist stock, probably in Bedford, and educated at Bedford grammar school. His grandmother's maiden name was Hale, suggesting a connection (unproven) with the seventeenth-century chief justice Sir Matthew Hale. White established himself around 1830 as a bookseller and printer in Bedford, and married Mary Anne Chignell of Colchester. He was a strict Calvinist Congregationalist and a political radical, regarded as one of Bedford's best public speakers. As a member of Lord John Russell's election committee in 1832 he was besieged by a mob and had the windows of his house broken. In 1843 he defeated almost single-handed a move to impose a requirement that all schoolteachers under the Bedford Charity should be Anglicans. His newspaper letters on this affair were reprinted in a pamphlet <span class="italic">Bedford Charity not Sectarian</span>. Influenced by Carlyle he became disenchanted with Calvinist orthodoxy. When in 1852 his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36864/', "(William) Hale White")</script>, later well known as a writer under the pseudonym Mark Rutherford, was expelled from a Calvinist seminary for questioning the unique inspiration of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, he came to his aid in a pamphlet <span class="italic">To Think or Not to Think</span>. Hale White claimed that his literary style owed much to his father.<br>
<br>White's political activities ruined his business and he ran into debt. Lord Charles Russell, stepbrother of Lord John and serjeant-at-arms, appointed him assistant, later principal, door-keeper of the House of Commons. He used his ringside seat to gather material for sketches of parliamentary life for the popular weekly <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>. These sketches draw a vivid picture of many notable parliamentary personalities and events of the period from the Crimean War to White's retirement in 1875. A selection of them was published in 1897 by Justin McCarthy, the Irish nationalist MP, under the title <span class="italic">The Inner Life of the House of Commons</span>. White died at Carshalton, Surrey, on 11 February 1882.<br>
