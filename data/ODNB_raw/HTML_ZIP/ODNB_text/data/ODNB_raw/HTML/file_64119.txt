<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (1759&#150;1830), <span class="occ">Home Office official and politician</span>, was baptized on 23 May 1759 at Clitheroe, Lancashire, the fifth son of the Revd James King, curate of Clitheroe and later chaplain to the House of Commons and dean of Raphoe, and his wife, Anne, daughter and coheir of John Walker of Hungrill, Yorkshire. After studying at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1777 and graduated BA (1781) and MA (1784), he went on to study law at both Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, before being called to the bar in 1790.<br>
<br>King's first governmental post came in January 1791 when he was appointed as a law clerk at the Home Office, on a salary of &pound;300 a year. In December 1791 he was made an under-secretary of state in the Home Office, his salary rising fivefold to &pound;1500 a year. Thus began a career which saw King become one of a group of talented young civil servants that was to be responsible for the administration of government under William Pitt the younger in the 1790s during the war against the French Revolution and the struggle against domestic radicals and reformers: a group which included men such as Francis Freeling, William Wickham, William Huskisson, and Evan Nepean. King was also intimately connected at this time with Edmund Burke and his circle of relatives and admirers, Burke stating that King's &#145;promotion to so honourable and advantageous a situation made us the happiest people in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 6.454). George Canning, too, thought highly of King, describing him as &#145;one of the worthiest and friendliest and best sort of men in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter-Journal</span>, 36); King was clearly part of a set of young Pittites who both worked and socialized together.<br>
<br>On 9 April 1792 King married Harriot Margaret, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19400/', "Rt Revd Charles Moss")</script>, bishop of Bath and Wells; they had four sons and a daughter. In December 1794 King took on further duties when he became responsible for much of the correspondence of the alien office, which, as well as monitoring French <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> in Britain under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Alien Act</span> of 1793, rapidly became the hub of an intelligence operation which involved counter-revolutionary activity and intelligence gathering at home, in Ireland, and on the continent. King's contribution to this effort was recognized in 1798 when he became one of the joint superintendents of aliens, along with William Wickham and Charles William Flint. In 1806, upon Lord Grenville's assumption of the premiership at the head of the ministry of all the talents, King was promoted to the post of joint secretary to the Treasury, where he superintended ministerial patronage. This position necessitated a seat in parliament and in March 1806 he was returned for the Irish pocket borough of Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh. His parliamentary career was a short one: he gave up his seat in July 1806, having found regular attendance at the House of Commons detrimental to his health. Thereupon King became comptroller of army accounts, a post he held until his death. He died on 30 March 1830 in Grosvenor Place, London, having gone into the office the previous day.<br>
