<span class="headword">Box,  (Frank) Sydney</span>  (1907&#150;1983), <span class="occ">film-maker and writer</span>, was born on 26 April 1907 in Beckenham, Kent, the son of Frank Box, a career soldier who was wounded in the First World War, and his wife, a seamstress whose maiden name was Dowling. As the eldest, Sydney helped his mother bring up his four siblings, while his father served as a quartermaster at a distant camp. She persuaded the eleven-year-old to enter a prize-winning one-act play in a local arts festival and, two years later, encouraged him to become a cub reporter on the <span class="italic">Kentish Times</span>.<br>
<br>Having taken a job in the City of London, Box began writing and producing plays for the Beckenham Dramatic and Operatic Society, where he met his first wife, Katherine Knight; they were married in 1929. However, &#145;her match did not strike on Sydney Box&#146;  (M. Box, 132) and the marriage was subsequently dissolved in 1934. Box began an affair with Muriel Baker (1905&#150;1991) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49588/', "Box, (Violette) Muriel")</script>], a continuity clerk employed by film director Michael Powell, whom he met after his play, <span class="italic">Murder Trial</span>, won the Welwyn cup in 1932.<br>
<br>Sydney and Muriel began collaborating on a series of playlets, six of which were published as <span class="italic">Ladies Only</span> in 1934. In the following year <span class="italic">Not this Man</span> won the National Drama Festival Award at the Old Vic, only for the press to denounce it as blasphemous. Box sued for libel, and the couple's lawyer advised them that living together would not impress the jury, so they married in Holborn register office on 23 May 1935. Their daughter, Leonora, was born on 5 November 1936.<br>
<br>By 1939 Box had over fifty plays, several librettos, and the book, <span class="italic">Film Publicity</span> (1937), to his credit. Yet, despite being invited to script commentaries for documentarist Ralph Smart, he remained a journalist. In addition to writing &#145;slightly imaginative news stories&#146;  (M. Box, 123) for <span class="italic">Renter</span> and <span class="italic">Today's</span>, he also worked as a weekend sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Christian Herald</span>, the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, as well as contributing to several Beckenham journals.<br>
<br>However, in 1940 he formed Verity Films, with Jay Lewis, to produce commercials and documentaries. Rejected for national service on account of a leg disability, he threw himself into making government-sponsored shorts such as <span class="italic">The Soldier's Food</span> (1940). However, the War Office and similar agencies were notoriously slow payers, and the partnership dissolved acrimoniously in the spring of 1941. Undeterred, Box refloated the company with a loan from the Film Producers Guild and within a year it was the country's biggest producer of propaganda and training films.<br>
<br>Having bought out Green Park Productions, Box moved into features, with <span class="italic">The Flemish Farm</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">On Approval</span> (1944). Following a spell at Two Cities, he took a lease on the Riverside Studios and resumed independent production with <span class="italic">29 Acacia Avenue</span> (1945). However, his greatest triumph was <span class="italic">The Seventh Veil</span> (1945), a melodrama starring Ann Todd that not only became a huge commercial hit, but also landed Sydney and Muriel the Oscar for best original screenplay.<br>
<br>Flushed with success, Box accepted the offer of fellow Methodist J. Arthur Rank to become managing director of Gainsborough Studios. Muriel was placed in charge of script development and they produced a number of successful and diverse pictures, including Ken Annakin's <span class="italic">Holiday Camp</span> (1947), the Margaret Lockwood costume drama <span class="italic">Jassy</span> (1947), and the Somerset Maugham adaptations <span class="italic">Quartet</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">Trio</span> (1950).<br>
<br>In her autobiography <span class="italic">Odd Woman Out</span>, Muriel summed up their working relationship: &#145;Sydney has a sanguine, buoyant temperament which helped him take everything in his stride with the minimum of fuss. He was an incurable optimist, I am an incurable pessimist, which created a neat balance&#146;  (M. Box, 138). A contemporary profile painted a less idyllic picture, however, alluding to the creative tension engendered by his short temper. Yet it also admired his energy and commitment: &#145;He bites off large lumps of life. But there's a baby face, a soft voice, refinement, sensitivity and the odd paradox of urbane naivety&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Bull</span>, 5 Oct 1946).<br>
<br>Dismayed by a frustrating stay at Pinewood Studios (1949&#150;50), Box took a year-long sabbatical to tour France and the United States. On his return he founded London Independent Producers to make Muriel's <span class="italic">The Happy Family</span> (1952). <span class="italic">Street Corner</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">The Beachcomber</span> (1954) followed and, with his younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71748/', "Betty Box")</script>, also now making films, the Boxes seemed set to dominate the British film industry. Indeed, No&euml;l Coward even dubbed them &#145;the Bront&euml;s of Shepherd's Bush&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1959, while negotiating a Hollywood deal to make <span class="italic">William the Conqueror</span>, Box suffered a cerebral haemorrhage and handed over his affairs to his brother-in-law, Peter Rogers. However, he made a surprise return to cinema in 1963, when he launched an unsuccessful bid to acquire British Lion Films after it was put up for auction by the government. He finally bowed out of pictures with Muriel's <span class="italic">Rattle of a Simple Man</span> (1964) and devoted his energies to acting as a director of Tyne-Tees Television and managing his 300 acre dairy farm at Mill Hill. However, he still harboured hopes of turning London Independent Producers into an agency for small-screen talent and possibly even launching his own television station. But a series of heart attacks in 1967 persuaded him to emigrate to Perth, Australia.<br>
<br>Divorced from Muriel in May 1969, Box married Sylvia Knowles in July. In the same year he published his first novel, <span class="italic">Diary of a Drop-out</span>; three more books, all whodunnits, followed over the ensuing decade, during which time he also sat on the Western Australian Arts Council. Sydney Box died in Perth on 25 May 1983.<br>
