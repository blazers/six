<span class="headword">Julius Frontinus,  Sextus</span>  (<em>d.</em> 103/4), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, held that appointment from <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 73 or 74 to 77. His service in Britain is attested only by a single sentence in Tacitus's <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, and his date of birth, origin, and early career are unknown. But as the author of a work on land-surveying (<span class="italic">Libri duo argumenti gromatici</span>, preserved only in excerpts), of the <span class="italic">Stratagemata</span>, and of the <span class="italic">De aquis</span>, as a patron and friend of the younger Pliny, and as a leading figure in the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, he was to become one of the most prominent persons of the age. Aelian, author of the <span class="italic">Tactica</span>, visited him to discuss military matters at Formiae, near Rome, and the poet Martial refers to his country retreat at Anxur (Tarracina); but there is no reason to suppose that Frontinus's original home was in Latium. Rather, his names and connections suggest strongly that he was of Gallic origin, probably from Nemausus (N&icirc;mes). His wife's name is unknown. A daughter married the leading general Sosius Senecio (consul for the second time in 107), a granddaughter was the wife of Pompeius Falco, governor of Britain at the beginning of Hadrian's reign. Frontinus also had links with the Calvisii, the family of Marcus Aurelius's grandmother.<br>
<br>Frontinus first appears in the historical record as praetor in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70. In this capacity he had to convene the important meeting of the senate on 1 January, in the absence of the consuls, who were the new emperor Vespasian and his elder son Titus, both still in the east. It has been conjectured that Frontinus had recently been promoted to the senate, perhaps by the emperor Galba (<i>r</i>. <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 68&#150;9), after service as an equestrian officer and procurator. Later in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70 he served in the campaign against the Batavians and other rebel tribes of northern Gaul and the Rhineland, probably as a legionary legate. He mentions in the <span class="italic">Stratagemata</span> that he received the surrender of 70,000 rebel Lingones, whose chief town was Andematunnum (Langres). An altar dedicated at Vetera (Xanten) to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva for Frontinus's welfare may belong to this time, if not to his later participation in a campaign in Germany  (<span class="italic">Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum</span>, 13, no. 8624). He presumably held the consulship (the necessary qualification for the governorship of Britain) at latest in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 73, in which year he probably succeeded Petillius Cerialis in the province.<br>
<br>To equal Cerialis was a difficult task, so Tacitus wrote, but Frontinus:<blockquote>took up and sustained the burden; he was a great man&#151;insofar as greatness was then permitted; and he subdued by arms the powerful and pugnacious people of the Silures, overcoming not only the courage of the enemy but the difficulties of the terrain. (Tacitus, 17)</blockquote>Archaeological evidence suggests, if it cannot prove, that Frontinus founded the legionary fortresses at Isca (Caerleon), in Silurian territory, and Deva (Chester), and that he added substantially to the network of auxiliary forts in mid-Wales. Apart from dealing with the refractory inhabitants of south Wales, Frontinus clearly, as Tacitus indicates, carried on where Cerialis had left off, in northern Britain. He may also deserve credit for giving the Silures a new urban centre, at Venta Silurum (Caer-went), and for fostering urban development in southern Britain, for example at Verulamium (St Albans). In midsummer of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 77 he was succeeded by Julius Agricola. His next known activity was in 83, when he accompanied the emperor Domitian on his campaign against the Chatti (of Hesse) in Upper Germany, either as governor of Lower Germany or as a member of the emperor's general staff (<i>comes Augusti</i>). Several important passages in the <span class="italic">Stratagemata</span> recall aspects of this service, including a much discussed description of the driving of <i>limites</i>, the word later used to describe Roman frontier works, through the German forest. A few years later Frontinus became proconsul of Asia: a massive arch set up at Hierapolis (Pamukkale) during his term of office is dated to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 86  (Eck, 77ff.).<br>
<br>The Asian proconsulship generally marked the final stage in a senatorial career and Frontinus probably devoted himself mainly to writing in the following decade. But the assassination of Domitian in September <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 96 and the accession of Nerva led to his re-emergence, as a senior statesman. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97 he was made <i>curator aquarum</i>, and undertook the overhaul of Rome's aqueducts with great conscientiousness, to judge from his manual on the subject. His praise of Rome's practical engineering, as the best testimony to the greatness of the empire, in contrast to the &#145;idle pyramids&#146; and the &#145;useless&#146; works of Greek architecture  (Frontinus, <span class="italic">De aquis</span>, 16), has often been quoted. In the same year he was one of the first two men chosen to serve on a special economy commission and early in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 98 held a second consulship. His colleague was Trajan, who had been adopted by Nerva as his heir in October <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97 and succeeded him in January <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 98. Frontinus's son-in-law Senecio was consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 99 and Frontinus himself held a third consulship, a very rare distinction, as colleague of Trajan, in 100. It may be inferred that Frontinus played an important part in securing the choice of Trajan as Nerva's heir. Frontinus died in 103 or 104, when Pliny recalled with satisfaction that he had been elected to the vacant place in the college of augurs which Frontinus's death had created. Frontinus had doubtless held this prestigious priesthood for many years, a further sign of his great distinction.<br>
