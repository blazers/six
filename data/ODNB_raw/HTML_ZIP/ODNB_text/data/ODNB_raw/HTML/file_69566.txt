<span class="headword">Jackson,  Arthur</span>  (<em>c.</em>1593&#150;1666), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Little Waldingfield, Suffolk. His father, John Jackson, a Spanish merchant, died when he was young, and his mother afterwards married Sir Thomas Crooke and died in Ireland. Jackson's uncle and guardian, Joseph Jackson, sent him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1614 and proceeded MA in 1617 (incorporated at Oxford in the same year). He married in 1619 Mary, the eldest daughter of Thomas Bownest of Stonebury, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Ordained on 27 December 1620, Jackson was chosen not long after by the inhabitants of St Michael, Wood Street, London, first as lecturer and subsequently as pastor. He was also chosen by the Clothworkers' Company, of which both his father and his uncle had been members, as its minister, preaching on every quarter-day in the company's chapel, commonly known as Lamb's Chapel, where he sometimes used a &#145;turn-up table&#146; (presumably a folding table) for the celebration of the communion. Laud apparently remonstrated with him, saying, rather revealingly, that &#145;I know not what you young Divines think, but for my part I know no other place of residence that God hath on earth, but the High Altar&#146;  (Jackson). True to his puritan belief in the sanctification of the Lord's day, he also refused to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, which permitted parishioners to engage in lawful recreations and sports after attending Sunday church services. However, as Jackson was a quiet and peaceable man, Laud took no action against him.<br>
<br>In 1640, when the new ecclesiastical canons were issued, Jackson was opposed to the &#145;et cetera&#146; oath which was suspected by the puritans as a mask for future innovations such as recognition of the pope and which, he wrote on 10 July, &#145;if God be with me, I hope I shall never take&#146;  (Birch, 2.286&#150;7). On 6 August he and a group of London puritan clergymen met at Nag's Head tavern about a petition against it. In 1644 Jackson was appointed a commissioner for the ordination of ministers, and in the following two years he took part in the London ministers' campaign for a strong presbyterian church government, and was one of the leading signatories in their petitions both to the houses of parliament and to the common council of the City. He was also chosen president of Sion College, London, in 1646. He was an active participant in the London Provincial Assembly after its formation in 1647, and twice served as its moderator. In 1648 and 1649 Jackson was one of the signatories of three London ministers' declarations against toleration, the army, and the army's plan to put the king on trial&#151;<span class="italic">A Testimony</span> (1648), <span class="italic">A Serious and Faithful Representation</span> (1649), and <span class="italic">A Vindication</span> (1649). Implicated in what was known as Love's plot in 1651, he was imprisoned with others for seventeen weeks in the Tower.<br>
<br>Jackson was a studious scholar and conscientious minister. The maintenance at St Michael, Wood Street, was small, and he was heard to say that he spent &pound;2000 out of his own estate during the years of his ministry there. Having moved in late 1649 to the parish of St Faith's under St Paul's, he continued his pastoral work there until 1662. His publications consist of four volumes of &#145;annotations&#146; on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> from the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> to the book of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>. He took pride in pointing out that when he &#145;first undertook this work&#146; there had not been &#145;any piece of this kind extant in English, saving only the Geneva marginall Notes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annotations upon the Five Books</span>, 1658, preface). In early 1660 Jackson was again appointed a commissioner for the approbation of ministers. When in May Charles II entered the City, he waited at the head of the London clergy in St Paul's Churchyard to present a <span class="roman">Bible</span> to the king. In 1661 he was one of the commissioners on the presbyterian side in the Savoy conference, but does not appear to have taken an active part in it. Ejected in 1662 from St Faith's under St Paul's, he retired first to Hadley, Middlesex, and afterwards to Edmonton. It was reported, however, that he was living at Whitefriars and preaching at conventicles between 1663 and 1665.<br>
<br>Jackson died at Edmonton on 5 August 1666 and was buried on 7 August at St Michael, Wood Street. He was survived by his wife, two sons (Joseph and John), and two daughters (Elizabeth Hoare and Martha Jackson).<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_69566"></a><span class="headword">John Jackson</span>  (<em>c.</em>1621&#150;1693), <span class="occ">ejected minister</span>, was also educated at Cambridge University, matriculating in 1638 at St Catharine's College, graduating BA in 1643 and proceeding MA in 1646 from Queens' College; he was made a fellow of Queens' in 1644. Ejected from Cambridge in 1650 for his refusal to take the engagement, he went to London where in 1653 he married Anne, daughter of Lawrence Brinley, a London merchant and lay presbyterian. In 1654, presented by the protector, he became rector of St Benet Paul's Wharf. He was suspended in early 1662 for refusing reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and was kept out of the parish church by force. He was also ejected from Moulsey, Surrey, but after the ejection seems to have continued living at Moulsey, where he completed his <span class="italic">Index Biblicus</span> in 1668. Afterwards he preached at Brentford, Middlesex, in 1672 and 1689. He published a memoir of his father in the 1682 edition of Arthur Jackson's <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Whole Book of Isaiah</span>. He died in 1693, either at Edmonton or at Tottenham Cross.<br>
