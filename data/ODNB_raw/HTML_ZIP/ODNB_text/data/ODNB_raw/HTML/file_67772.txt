<span class="headword">Wallinger, Sir  John Arnold</span>  (1869&#150;1931), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and literary prototype</span>, was born on 25 October 1869 at Poona, India, the son of William H. Arnold Wallinger, deputy conservator of forests in the Indian forest service, and his wife, Anne Jane. He had two brothers and two sisters.<br>
<br>In 1896 Wallinger joined the Indian police in Ahmadabad as an inspector. Having been promoted assistant superintendent, in 1902 he was seconded to the Metropolitan Police in London as an instructor at a time of rising anxiety about Indian political activists and fears concerning the security of the coronation of Edward VII. He then stayed in England on &#145;special deputation&#146; to Scotland Yard. In 1904 he returned to India and established a reputation as a brave officer with a talent for acquiring local native dialects and a flair for undercover criminal intelligence operations when he would &#145;black up&#146;. On one occasion, while mounted, he saved a subordinate from a mob during a violent strike by charging a hostile crowd, and received a sword wound to the head that kept him in hospital for three months. Wallinger was transferred to London in 1910, with the rank of superintendent, to head the Indian political intelligence office, a new organization created to monitor the subversive activities in Britain of Indian nationalists.<br>
<br>In 1915 Wallinger acquired an assistant, Philip Vickery, who was gazetted with the rank of major, and attached to general headquarters (GHQ) in France as a staff officer to assess discontent among Indian troops. His task was to identify and isolate malcontents while preventing enemy propaganda from undermining morale at the front and in India. While at GHQ he encountered his younger brother Ernest, a gunnery officer who had lost a foot at Le Cateau and had joined the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Based in offices in Basil Street, below his flat, Ernest Wallinger had organized an espionage network of train watchers, codenamed WL, that stretched behind the German lines and into Belgium and neutral Holland. John Wallinger was appointed his controller in Geneva, supervising a network of British agents in Switzerland. According to the deputy director of military intelligence, Sir Walter Kirke, an attempt to expand into Holland and Scandinavia proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>Wallinger is said to have been a keen reader of spy stories, but his initial agents&#151;mostly waiters in restaurants&#151;were easily spotted by the Swiss authorities. Instead, in autumn 1915 he persuaded an established writer, W. Somerset Maugham, to work for him, based in Geneva. The latter was subsequently very dismissive of his experiences, which he described as &#145;on the whole extremely monotonous&#146;  (Maugham, viii), and by summer 1916 he had returned to Britain. Nevertheless, he accumulated enough material for a book of short stories, <span class="italic">Ashenden, or, The British Agent</span>, published in 1928.<br>
<br>Interestingly, Maugham used Wallinger as the model for his spymaster in the Colonel R stories. This character had &#145;a yellow, deeply-lined face &hellip; [with] thin grey hair and a toothbrush moustache &hellip; a man that you could neither like nor trust at first sight&#146;  (Maugham, 2). Colonel R reminded the narrator that: &#145;If you do well you'll get no thanks and if you get into trouble you'll get no help&#146;  (ibid., 4). Alfred Hitchcock's film <span class="italic">The Secret Agent</span> (1936), starring Madeline Carroll and John Gielgud, was based on the stories. According to one authority, in his portrait of &#145;R&#146;, Maugham expressed a mood of disenchantment and hard-nosed realism that &#145;set the tone for an entirely new generation of espionage writing&#146;  (Stafford, 182).<br>
<br>In August 1916 Wallinger was posted back to India to suppress agitation there, and was busy with such intelligence operations until the end of the war. In 1919 he was seconded to Egypt. On his return to London in the following year he was appointed deputy inspector-general of the Indian police service. In 1925 he was knighted. Although offered the post of deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Wallinger chose to retire to Brighton in 1926. He died on 7 January 1931 at his home, Kingswood, Surrenden Road, Brighton. Wallinger never married, but Maugham later recalled dining with him and his attractive mistress.<br>
