<span class="headword">Meldola,  Raphael</span>  (1754&#150;1828), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Leghorn, Italy, the son of Hezekiah Moses Meldola (1725&#150;1791), a professor of oriental languages at the University of Paris. He came from a line of rabbinical scholars taking their family name from Meldola, near Forli, in north-east Italy. The first to attain some prominence was Jacob Meldola in the sixteenth century; a family tradition of earlier Spanish origins, though not improbable, cannot be proved. Raphael Meldola's paternal grandfather (1684&#150;1748), also named Raphael, was rabbi in Pisa and Bayonne. At Leghorn, Meldola received a secular education, alongside a thorough training in talmudic and wider rabbinic literature. After employment as a preacher he attained rabbinical qualification in 1796, by which date he was married to Stella (Estrella) Bollaffi (<i>d</i>. 1851); they had eight children. He was appointed <i>dayyan</i> (a member of the rabbinical court) in 1803. In October 1804 he was invited to become <i>&#145;hakham</i> (chief rabbinical authority) of the Sephardic Jews in London, where he worked congenially with his Ashkenazic counterpart, Solomon Hirschell. Although he presumably knew some French, he never mastered English properly and may have preached in Spanish, of which his command was indifferent. Relations with his lay leadership were difficult and sometimes stormy; coming from a large Italian Jewish community, long integrated socially, he probably failed to appreciate the need for a strong lay leadership to steer British Jews towards Anglicization.<br>
<br>Meldola's activity was naturally limited to his own (and the wider) Jewish community. He proved energetic in combating missionary attempts at attracting children of the Jewish poor to a locally established school and addressed himself, on arrival, to securing co-operation with the Ashkenazic community regarding control of the butchery trade in accordance with Jewish religious requirements. The emergence of a joint board for <i>shehitah</i>, to implement this, owed much to him. For the re-opening of the Bevis Marks Synagogue in 1825, following its redecoration, he composed a Hebrew hymn which was rendered, innovatively, by a choir&#151;a feature that would later become a regular congregational institution.<br>
<br>Meldola's published legacy included two significant Hebrew texts. The first, a commentary on the entry of the high priest into the holy of holies in the temple, as described in the liturgy for the Day of Atonement, was included in a prayer book published at Leghorn in 1791. His manual regarding marital conduct (<i>&#145;huppath &#145;hatanim</i>) appeared, likewise at Leghorn, in 1797. Unpublished Hebrew works were said to survive him. Fourteen other pieces have been traced  (Barnett, 13&#150;14), mainly special prayers or sermons for national occasions, such as the peace of 1814. He attended Nelson's funeral and subsequently preached a commemorative sermon (which does not survive), as he did in 1817, on the death of Princess Charlotte, which was perhaps the occasion of his being introduced to George III by the archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>During his latter years Meldola suffered from ill health. He died on 1 June 1828 and was buried two days later in the Sephardic Jewish cemetery at Mile End, London; his wife survived him. He cannot be said to have been a national figure, but it is notable that the bells of Aldgate church tolled while his funeral procession passed. Of his sons, David (1797&#150;1853), also a rabbi, was his <i>de facto</i> successor, although he did not bear the title <i>&#145;hakham</i>. Through his daughter Rebecca, married in 1819 to David de Sola, the reader (<i>&#145;hazzan</i>) in his own synagogue, a number of leading Sephardi families in England, Canada, and the United States were descended from him.<br>
