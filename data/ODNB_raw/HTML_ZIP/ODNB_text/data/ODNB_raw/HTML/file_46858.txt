<span class="headword">Crossley,  Francis William</span>  (1839&#150;1897), <span class="occ">engine manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, and his brother, <a name="cosubject_46859"></a><span class="headword">Sir William John Crossley</span>, first baronet  (1844&#150;1911), were born in Antrim, the sons of Major Francis Crossley (1787&#150;1846) of Glenburn, Dunmurry, Antrim, and his second wife, Elizabeth Helen Irwin, whom he married in 1837. William, and probably Francis, more affectionately known as Frank, attended the Royal School, Dungannon, from where William went to Bonn for his further education&#151;later to prove of great value in the brothers' association with their German partners. Both trained as engineers, Frank at the works of Robert Stephenson in Newcastle and later working as a draughtsman in Liverpool, and William at the works of W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co., Elswick.<br>
<br>In 1866 the two brothers formed a partnership and with financial help from an uncle, Hastings Irwin, purchased a small engineering business in Great Marlborough Street, Manchester, which manufactured products for the rubber industry. Frank proved to have excellent design as well as technical skills and one of his inventions revolutionized the manufacture of indiarubber thread. Later, his patent thread lathe was adopted by every rubber manufacturer in Britain. William played a part in the technical development of the small firm but was more involved with management matters. The manufacture of internal combustion engines, meanwhile, had gathered pace in Germany. This was largely due to the work of Nikolaus August Otto and his partner, Eugen Langen. In 1867 their engine, referred to as an atmospheric gas engine, was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition. Following agreements with N. A. Otto &amp; Co., the Crossley brothers began manufacturing gas engines in 1869.<br>
<br>Industry was badly in need of a small power source as an alternative to steam engines that could be used to drive machinery, but the engine was a noisy, cumbersome contraption and Frank immediately instigated improvements in design and operation. An estimated 1300 of these engines, ranging from 0.5 to 3 horsepower, were manufactured and sold to a wide range of industries. The Crossley Gas Engine quickly became a household name. Otto's invention in 1876 of the four-stroke cycle engine&#151;the principle of all modern internal combustion engines&#151;was a major turning-point in the history of the Crossley firm. More efficient and quieter in operation than its predecessor, the atmospheric engine, it was more economical in use and capable of producing much higher power. As a consequence, demand for the new engine increased rapidly. Larger premises were obtained in Pottery Lane, Openshaw, in 1881, where the firm remained throughout the twentieth century. Engine sales rose from a few hundred in 1869 to over 25,000 in 1897. A wide variety of industries benefited from their use including printing, food, textiles, and engineering.<br>
<br>The private lives of the Crossley brothers were somewhat different. Both, however, had a seemingly overwhelming desire to be of service to others, helping in whatever capacity they could. Frank was a man of deep religious convictions. Work at the factory often started with a service in the specially built chapel which his workers were invited to attend. Away from the works he did much to help the poor and needy of Manchester. William, on the other hand, was very public-spirited and active on numerous committees throughout Manchester and Cheshire.<br>
<br>Frank Crossley's sincere religious belief led him to prevent the sales of engines to breweries and to theatres and public houses, where they could be used to generate electricity. He later softened his views, allowing engines to be sold, but his profits were donated to various charities. His marriage on 1 June 1871 to Emily Kerr (1849&#150;1928) served to strengthen his charitable nature. Her views, so similar to his own, enabled both of them to become even more active in social work. Frank was particularly involved in the work of the Salvation Army movement and General Booth was a frequent visitor to the Crossleys' home in Bowdon, Cheshire. Frank became affectionately known in Salvation Army circles as &#145;the Paymaster&#146;, his gifts to the movement being estimated at over &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>With the help of his wife, Frank Crossley's work continued in earnest throughout the poorer areas of Manchester. An old and disreputable music hall in Ancoats, known as the Star, was pulled down and a new hall erected for meetings. It included bathrooms, dining rooms, and residences attached for the workers. The cost, paid for by the Crossleys, was &pound;20,000. After a few months their home in Bowdon was sold. The Crossleys moved into the new building in Ancoats soon after its opening in 1889 to be nearer &#145;his people&#146;. Various similar halls were built with Frank bearing the cost in all cases. His unstinting devotion and desire to help others earned him the title St Francis of Ancoats.<br>
<br>Frank Crossley died at a comparatively young age on 25 March 1897, many would say of exhaustion. On the day of his funeral, a crowd of 15,000 people turned out to pay tribute to someone they had come to love dearly. Some people came from Ireland, some from Scotland and other distant parts of Britain. True to his nature, he asked to be buried among the poor people of Ancoats, in Phillips Park cemetery. He was survived by his wife and four of his five children, Helen (1872&#150;1966), Alan Hastings (1878&#150;1917), Erskine Alick (1880&#150;1918), and Francis Marshall (1884&#150;1938); Richard Frank, born in 1873, died in 1884.<br>
<br>William Crossley was no less sparing in his efforts to be of service to the community. He became a highly respected and successful businessman and was of immense help to his brother in steering the firm through difficult times&#151;in particular, the numerous High Court actions against infringers of the Otto patent for the four-stroke engine. Such actions went totally beyond the principles and beliefs of the Crossleys and were initiated only as a last resort to ensure the continued growth of the firm and the employment of many hundreds of workers. His marriage on 20 April 1876 to Mabel Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of Francis Anderson, produced five children: Kenneth Irwin (1877&#150;1951), Eric (1883&#150;1889), Brian (1886&#150;1915), Lettice (1879&#150;1889), and Ciceley (<i>b</i>. 1880).<br>
<br>In 1901, William Crossley was elected a member of the Cheshire county council and served on numerous committees. He was chairman of the Manchester Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Throat and the Crossley Sanatorium, which he founded at Delamere in Cheshire. He also became chairman of the Boys' and Girls' Refuges, at Strangeways, Manchester, president of the Young Men's Christian Association, and founder of the Crossley Lads' Club and Openshaw Lads' Club. In 1902 he became a director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company.<br>
<br>In recognition of his public service, the corporation of Manchester conferred upon William Crossley the freedom of the city in 1903. He became a member of parliament for the Altrincham division of Cheshire in 1908 and was made a justice of the peace in 1907. In 1909 he received a baronetcy but had little time to enjoy the honour. He died at his home, Elmfield, Anson Road, Rusholme, south Manchester, on 12 October 1911.<br>
