<span class="headword">&Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid,  Ailbe</span> <span class="st"> [Albinus O'Molloy]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1223), <span class="occ">abbot of Baltinglass and bishop of Ferns</span>, had a close association with King John, with whom he probably first came into contact when John, on his visit to Ireland in 1185, issued a confirmation charter to the Cistercian Baltinglass Abbey, where &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid was abbot. The surname &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid is associated with kings of Fir Cell (in Offaly), on the northern boundary of which was located the Cistercian monastery of Kilbeggan, which lends support to Ailbe's connection with that area. On 22 March 1186, at a provincial synod at Dublin, &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid preached a sermon denouncing the incontinence of Welsh and English clergy in Ireland which provoked a response from Gerald of Wales. Shortly thereafter he was made bishop of Ferns (the form &#145;bishop of Wexford&#146; also occurs), probably with the assent of John, son of Henry II, as lord of Ireland (who, according to Gerald, previously had offered him the see). He was present at the coronation of Richard I on 3 September 1189 and at the council at Pipewell on the 15th. He attended the consecration of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 17 March 1192 and was with John, count of Mortain, at Nottingham on 27 December of that year.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1203 Pope Innocent III appointed &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid, along with the archbishop of Tuam and the bishop of Kilmacduagh, to proclaim the ecclesiastical censure laid on Robert, bishop of Waterford, for despoiling Malachias, bishop of Lismore. On 3 April 1206 he was recommended to the electoral body of the archiepiscopal see of Cashel by King John, as his nominee, and on 6 April received 10 marks as the king's gift. On 2 October 1207 Pope Innocent replied to his queries concerning the ordination of clerics by bishops other than their own. In the same year &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid provided testimony to Innocent in support of the canonization of Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail, archbishop of Dublin. On 19 June 1208, along with Meiler fitz Henry, the justiciar, and Philip of Worcester, he was appointed as King John's representative to the king of Connacht and other kings and magnates of Ireland. On 15 September 1215 he was given royal protection while attending the Fourth Lateran Council at Rome.<br>
<br>Evidence for &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid's long-running dispute with William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke and Striguil, over lands of the see of Ferns, first appears on 30 May 1216, when Innocent III, doubtless in response to personal representations made to him by &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid at the Lateran Council, instructed the archbishops of Dublin and Tuam, as papal judges delegate, to command William Marshal and others to restore the disputed property; an interdict had been placed on the earl's land in Ireland and the bishop of Ferns, then in England, had been ordered to excommunicate the Marshal and his accomplices. On 5 September 1216 King John gave &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid custody of the vacant see of Killaloe until such time as he could be appointed bishop; but he was not promoted, probably because of the death of John a few weeks later. Early in 1218 he brought a case against William Marshal in an ecclesiastical court presided over by the archbishops of Dublin and Tuam; but on 18 April a royal writ was issued prohibiting the case from being heard until such time as Henry III came of age. Further letters on 20 April directed Geoffrey de Marisco, the justiciar, to see that the judges did not hear a plea regarding a lay fee in an ecclesiastical court. The Marshal took advantage of his position as regent to prevent pursuit of the claim on the grounds that the disputed land was a lay fee held of the king, who would warrant it to the Marshal when he came of age. On 25 June 1218 Pope Honorius III, possibly in response to representations from William Marshal, sent letters to &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid, to the Marshal, and to Henry, archbishop of Dublin, requesting them to come to some agreement. The Marshal died excommunicate on 14 May 1219, having refused to restore the disputed property to the see of Ferns. According to Matthew Paris, after the Marshal's death &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid petitioned the crown for restoration of the lands, but the earl's heir, William (II), and his brothers withheld their consent, whereupon he foretold the extinction of the family in the male line. Ironically, &Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid had co-operated with the Marshal in the foundation of the Cistercian abbey of Duiske (Graiguenamanagh), dedicating its cemetery in 1204 and witnessing the Marshal's charter to Duiske about 1207.<br>
<br>&Oacute; M&aacute;elmuaid acted as suffragan in the diocese of Winchester, consecrating a chapel at the Cistercian abbey of Waverley on 6 November 1201 and dedicating five altars there on 10 July 1214. The Benedictine community of the cathedral priory of St Swithun's, Winchester, made him a member of their fraternity. He died in 1223. He may have been the author of an extant Latin life of St Abb&aacute;n.<br>
