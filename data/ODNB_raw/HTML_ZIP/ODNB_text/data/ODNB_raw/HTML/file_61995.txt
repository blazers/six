<span class="headword">Ridout,  Alan John</span>  (1934&#150;1996), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at 10 Pickhurst Rise, West Wickham, near Beckenham, Kent, on 9 December 1934, the son of George Alfred Ridout, bank clerk, and his wife, Dorothy Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardner. He always knew he would become a composer. Taking up the piano at nine he would &#145;play with pitches as other children played with blocks or Meccano&#146;  (<span class="italic">Composer's Life</span>, 12). He left Haberdashers' Aske's School in Hampstead at the age of fifteen and entered the Guildhall School of Music, where he studied piano under George Rogers. The composition aspect of the course, however, proved disappointing. Consequently Ridout initiated correspondence with Benjamin Britten, seeking advice on his early compositions. In 1951 he entered the Royal College of Music (RCM), where he studied under Herbert Howells, Gordon Jacob, and Thornton Lofthouse. In 1954 he left to become director of music at Holmewood House School, Kent, where he taught &#145;anything of a musical nature&#146;  (ibid., 71). He simultaneously spent many nights at his manuscripts, which predictably took its toll, and he resigned in 1957 having narrowly escaped a nervous breakdown.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Ridout studied with Michael Tippett. Despite Ridout's negative attitude to the fruits of Tippett's teaching their friendship left impression enough for Ridout to dedicate his second symphony to Tippett in 1964. In 1958, shortly after the death of his father, Ridout was awarded a Netherlands government scholarship to study under Henk Badings. Badings took great interest in Ridout's work and arranged his first commissions, took him to concerts, and introduced him to electronic and microtonal music. Ridout explored these styles in works such as <span class="italic">Psalm for Sine Wave Generator</span> (1959; &#145;one of the first pieces of purely electronic music by an English composer&#146;, Scott, 6), <span class="italic">Music for 31-tone Organ</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Trio for Strings in 31-tone tuning</span> (1961).<br>
<br>Ridout returned to the RCM in 1960 to teach theory and composition, remaining there until 1984. He took up tutelage with Thurston Dart in 1960 and, under his influence, developed a passion for Gregorian plainchant. This manifested itself in works like <span class="italic">Litany</span> (1985), where it is juxtaposed with a fuller choral sound. Dart took an active role in publishing Ridout's music and through him Ridout became involved in broadcasting. He presented two educational series for the BBC, beginning in 1961, which covered a wide range of musical topics. The early 1960s also saw Ridout accept teaching positions at Birmingham, Cambridge, and London universities. He was made a fellow of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1964, receiving further honours, including a fellowship of the RCM, later on.<br>
<br>Of all the genres in which Ridout composed his sacred choral music, organ works, and children's operas were those most frequently remembered. This was a product of his position as composer in residence to the Canterbury Cathedral choir and later his work with the gifted pupils of King's School, Canterbury, between 1964 and 1993. At Canterbury Ridout worked closely with the chorus-master Allen Wicks and built a strong rapport with both choir and cathedral. Wicks commissioned many works from Ridout, a number of which remain in the cathedral library, including <span class="italic">The Seven Last Words</span> (1965) for organ. Other significant works from this period include <span class="italic">The Burning of Jan Pallak</span> (1969, written for Canterbury festival), <span class="italic">St John Passion</span> (1962), and the first set of <span class="italic">Sacred Songs</span> (1964). Ridout finally settled in Canterbury in 1968.<br>
<br>The serial and microtonal writings of the early 1960s did not remain Ridout's preferred genre. His eclectic output throughout the 1970s and 1980s saw his music evolving stylistically into something less avant-garde yet distinctly modern and quintessentially English. Ridout's symphonic output gave a clear indication of this development: from the serial techniques and harsh dissonances exploited in the first three symphonies he moved to baroque infusions in the fourth, modal inflections in the sixth, and finally, in the eighth, came to a modal lyricism characteristic of twentieth-century British composers. Works commissioned in the 1970s such as the <span class="italic">Christmas Oratorio</span> (1971) and concertino for clarinet (1975) similarly showed a shift towards tonality and the beginnings of a more mature sound world while retaining the rhythmic drive already characteristic of his earlier music. His concerto for flute, harp, and strings (1979) illustrated the modal English tonality on which he settled. The 1980s and 1990s were marked by a more overt lyricism in Ridout's music that subsequently encouraged stronger commercial interest. The year 1984 saw the completion of <span class="italic">Jacob and the Angel</span>, dedicated to Gordon Jacob, the first of his three superb cello concertos, and the eighth symphony. Between 1987 and 1990 Ridout also held a teaching position at Oxford University.<br>
<br>In 1989 Ridout suffered a heart attack and consequently reduced his teaching commitments, concentrating on composition and editing. He moved to France in 1993, first to Vitr&eacute;, and later to Caen. Following a religious experience in 1994 he converted to Catholicism. He became an oblate of the Benedictine order at Ampleforth Abbey, Yorkshire, and later bequeathed all of his manuscripts to their archives. He wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Composer's Life</span>, later that year. Ridout, who never married, died on 19 March 1996 of a heart attack in Caen, France. Although he remained outside the musical mainstream throughout his life, he was renowned within musical circles for his extensive musical output, teaching, and editorial work.<br>
