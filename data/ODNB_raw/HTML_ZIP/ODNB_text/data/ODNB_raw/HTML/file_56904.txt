<span class="headword">Cannan <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Pullein-Thompson]</span>,  Joanna Maxwell</span>  (1896&#150;1961), <span class="occ">novelist and children's writer</span>, was born on 27 May 1896 at Magdalen Gate House, Oxford, the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32277/', "Charles Cannan (1858&#150;1919)")</script>, dean of Trinity College, Oxford, and secretary to the delegates of Oxford University Press, and his wife, Mary (1857&#150;1943), daughter of Andrew Wedderburn-Maxwell, a Scot in the Indian Civil Service. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98106/', "May Wedderburn Cannan")</script> was her elder sister. Charles Cannan was intellectual, immersed in Aristotelian scholarship, and Mary Cannan preferred adult company. Apart from three mornings a week at Wychwood School, their daughters lived in solitude at home, playing out romantic dramas based on favourite books, or the heroic tales of their Scottish ancestors. Holidays spent riding and boating in the highlands, or climbing in the Lake District and Switzerland, reinforced their ideals of courage and determination. Cannan grew up with a lifelong philosophy of persevering against the odds, and meeting success or failure with light-hearted gallantry.<br>
<br>Cannan was educated at Wychwood School in Oxford from 1902 to 1913, and then went to finishing school in Paris. She planned to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, but the 1914&#150;18 war prevented this. On 11 June 1918 she married Captain Harold James Pullein-Thompson (1885&#150;1957), son of James Pullein-Thompson, a Church of England clergyman ministering in London, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Darbyshire. He had an impressive war record, and Cannan admired his commanding ways with waiters and taxi drivers, but his inability to make a peacetime living shook her. Marooned in suburban Wimbledon, she determined to earn money herself by writing. Her first novel, <span class="italic">The Misty Valley</span> (1922), was well received, and followed quickly by others, until in 1931 Cannan felt wealthy enough to buy The Grove, Peppard Common, a white Oxfordshire dower house.<br>
<br>Here, with her husband, four children, and innumerable animals, Cannan created a congenially bohemian lifestyle. After her restricted childhood she wanted freedom for her family and herself. There might be domestic and financial crises, bantams in the kitchen and hiccups with the boiler, but, ensconced in her small parlour, she worked away steadily at her novels. These were witty, satirical, even cynical, and usually well reviewed. She presented clashes between idealists and materialists, with no easy solutions. Often she drew on her own experiences. <span class="italic">The Misty Valley</span> dissects a difficult marriage; <span class="italic">High Table</span> (1930) depicts Oxford dons; <span class="italic">Ithuriel's Hour</span> (1931) portrays the stresses of mountaineering. Later in her career she tried some traditional English detective stories. From <span class="italic">Death at The Dog</span> (1940) to <span class="italic">Murder Included</span> (1950), they featured a socially inept detective, Pryce, who became a further butt for Cannan's sarcastic wit.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Pony for Jean</span> (1936) was Cannan's first children's story. Previously pony books were animal biographies, like <span class="italic">Black Beauty</span>. Cannan, watching her children and their ponies, switched the focus of interest to the rider, establishing a major new trend, later followed by her daughters, Josephine, Diana, and Christine Pullein-Thompson. After Cannan most &#145;pony books&#146; were &#145;rider books&#146;, stories of children schooling much-loved, if recalcitrant, ponies; yet hers, with their passion for animals and country life, and their stylish writing, remain pre-eminent. Jean, the brave determined girl who is also the heroine of two sequels, <span class="italic">Another Pony for Jean</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">More Ponies for Jean</span> (1943), is a self-portrait; while the Pullein-Thompson girls provided inspiration for the lively, horsy children of <span class="italic">They Bought her a Pony</span> (1944), who bicker, and fall off, and make gymkhana stars of their unpromising mounts.<br>
<br>Small, slight, and fair, with myopic grey-green eyes, Cannan lived enthusiastically, but hard work and wartime privations undermined her health. In 1952 tuberculosis was diagnosed. Weakened further by surgery, she died of heart failure following influenza at Blandford Cottage Hospital, Dorset, on 22 April 1961, reciting Landor's &#145;I strove with none, for none was worth my strife&#146; to maintain her courage to the end. She was buried at Fairmile cemetery, Henley-on-Thames.<br>
