<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  Patrick</span>  (1606&#150;1674), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland, the son of Colonel William Ogilvie, a younger brother of Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartin, and either his wife, Elizabeth Langlands, or Barbara Kinnaird. Not much is known of Ogilvie's early life, until he entered Swedish military service as an ensign in 1624 in the regiment of James Spens, the son of the Stuart ambassador in Stockholm, Sir James Spens. From 1632 he served as a major in the conscripted infantry regiment from the &Aring;bo region, and after ten years' service he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He continued with this regiment until he became its colonel in 1657.<br>
<br>Although Ogilvie married three times, the dates of the marriages and whether he had children remain unclear. His first wife, a Scotswoman, was the daughter of James Scott and Margareta Gibson. His second wife was a Swedish noblewoman, Catharina Mannersk&ouml;ld, as was his third wife, Helena Sass.<br>
<br>Ogilvie undertook an active role in civic life in Sweden, and made donations to the poor in July 1640. He was keen to be integrated further into Swedish society and so produced two documents in order to initiate the ennoblement process in Sweden. The first was signed in 1640 by his fellow Scottish officers James Lumsden, David Leslie, William Borthwick, Hans Ramsay, and William Weiners. The second document was witnessed in 1642 by Baron Patrick Ruthven, Baron Vilhelm Spens, Ludvig Leslie, James Hamilton, Hugo Mowatt, and Patrik Morus. The two documents claimed that Ogilvie was of Scottish noble descent on both maternal and paternal sides. As a result he was introduced to the Swedish house of nobility in 1642; he received donations of land from Queen Kristina in 1648. The following year Ogilvie provided the Riksd&aring;d (the Swedish parliament) with a further document from Perth dated 1647.<br>
<br>Ogilvie was a colourful character, as the records of the Riksr&aring;d (Swedish state council) reveal. In 1650 they discussed punishing Ogilvie for having attacked a burgess in Stockholm. He had already been pardoned by Queen Kristina for unlawfully firing a weapon on her birthday. Despite these misdemeanours Ogilvie remained in royal favour and obtained the rights to two further properties in 1651. The land he held included Selkis and Voltis in Kumo parish, &Aring;rlak in Virmo parish, Otrova by Narva and Reguleva in Koporie region in Ingermanland, Vurda in Jama region, and Teivaala in Birkkala parish in Finland. Ogilvie did not confine himself to military duties, but entered the Swedish diplomatic service, and conveyed correspondence between the Russian General Nashchokin and the Swedish military commander Magnus de la Gardie in 1656. Sweden was at war with Poland at the time and Russian support was vital to Swedish success. The following year he moved from the &Aring;bo to the Viborg region infantry, and soon took on the position of governor. He also served in Riga in 1657 informing the Swedish government of shortages in manpower, provisions, and ammunition there. In 1660 he was again a governor, this time in the Kexholm region. After that nothing is known of him until his death in 1674.<br>
