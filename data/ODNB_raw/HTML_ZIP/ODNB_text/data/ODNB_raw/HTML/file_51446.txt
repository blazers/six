<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bishop, Dame  (Margaret) Joyce</span>  (1896&#150;1993), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 28 July 1896 at The Glen, Oxford Road, Moseley, King's Norton, Worcestershire, the second of three children of Charles Benjamin Bishop, lacquer manufacturer and owner of a silver plating business, and his wife, Amy Stewart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tindall. From a solid middle-class churchgoing background, the family believed in the importance of educating girls and the development of a sense of personal commitment to society. Her early education was interrupted by serious illness, and she was taught at home until she was nine. From an early age her interest in literature was encouraged and after Edgbaston high school she went in 1915 to read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Oxford in wartime was a difficult place, although Bishop contributed regularly to college dramatic productions along with her academic studies, enjoying her time there. Because she was taken ill during her final examinations her degree results were not distinguished (she was awarded a third-class degree in 1918). However, personal recommendations from her tutors enabled her to obtain her first teaching post at Hertfordshire and Essex high school. Her next appointment, in 1924, took her as headmistress to Holly Lodge high school, Smethwick (where she succeeded her elder sister, Phyllis Mabel, born in 1891) in one of the poorest and most heavily industrial areas near Birmingham, where she remained for eleven years. When she first arrived the school was only two years old and still incomplete. Here she developed her ideas on the importance of an academic education available regardless of parental income as the way to develop the full potential of girls. This conviction remained central to her work throughout her career.<br>
<br>In 1935 Bishop became headmistress of the Godolphin and Latymer School, Hammersmith, west London, remaining there for twenty-eight years. This was a well established, endowed girls' school with about 40 per cent of scholarship places. Here she found that, freed from having to battle for what she wanted as she had done at Holly Lodge, she was able to turn her formidable energies into other channels and develop strategic plans for the school. In addition she became an active member of the Association of Headmistresses. The threat of war led her to decide on evacuation for the whole school in September 1939, eventually to Newbury, Berkshire. However, after two years it was finally decided that school life would be more satisfactory in London, and by July 1943 all the students and staff had returned. The next challenge facing Bishop and the governors, that of the Butler <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944, was met with the decision that Godolphin should take aided status. As a result fees were abolished for all, while the school remained selective and academic, continuing, in Bishop's words, &#145;to foster scholarship and sound learning&#146;. Throughout her career as headmistress she inspired deep loyalties among both staff and pupils, and many remained immensely grateful for the opportunities she opened to them. At the same time she continued to expand her interests outside the school and became involved in a number of working parties and committees at a national level. One of the most far reaching concerned the recruitment of women into teaching. She joined a government working party which reported in 1949 to the Ministry of Education with wide ranging recommendations designed to attract more women entrants. A pioneer herself in her recruitment of both married and part-time women teachers at Godolphin, she was involved in follow-up research to reverse the shortages created by the shrinking number of unmarried graduate teachers, particularly in girls' grammar schools. This report was presented to the Association of Headmistresses and the Association of Assistant Mistresses in 1961. Both these reports contributed to the growing debate changing the climate of opinion about professional women working outside the home. Bishop's words on the subject of the &#145;vanishing spinster&#146; in 1962 were widely reported.<br>
<br>Bishop's contribution to the Association of Headmistresses was recognized when she became chairman in 1951&#150;2. Her keynote speeches to the annual conferences in these years reflected her educational principles, which were essentially practical rather than original. School &#145;must be a place where [the pupil] develops her intellectual gifts for the fulfilment of herself, and for the service of God and one where she learns to know that in that service lies perfect freedom&#146;  (report of 1951 Headmistresses' Conference, 11: U. Warwick Mod. RC, MSS 18, Association of Headmistress, TBN 27). From this period too, the invitations to sit on committees and governing bodies increased. Her formidable energy enabled her to combine the direction of her school with her outside interests. Among other bodies she served on the Secondary Schools Examination Council and the National Advisory Council for the Training and Supply of Teachers. On her retirement from Godolphin in 1963 she was made a DBE in recognition of her services to education (having already been made CBE in 1953).<br>
<br>Bishop continued to develop her interests in education long into retirement. She was supervising tutor of postgraduate teaching students at King's College, London, for ten years. A passionate opponent of comprehensive education and combative supporter of grammar schools, she made a major contribution to the effort to raise substantial bursary funds when Godolphin became independent in 1977 in reaction to local reorganization. Between 1958 and 1984 she served as a governor of the Royal Ballet School, taking particular interest in the academic education of the young dancers. For many years she was closely associated with the Froebel College, Roehampton, which trained teachers for primary schools, and its associated school, Ibstock Place, becoming chairman of the governors of the Froebel College in 1964. Minutes of governors' meetings indicate an incisive mind at work, able to present clear summaries for consideration: her style was direct and unpompous. Her main interests were in management and the welfare of the student body. In the 1970s, with the reduction in teacher training numbers, the college faced major reorganization and amalgamation, which Bishop strongly opposed. She favoured continuing independence for the college. However, the weight of government policy led to the plans being accepted in 1977. Bishop made her final appearance at the governing body in 1979.<br>
<br>Bishop's energy and good health continued well into her retirement. Her interest in people and her capacity for making friends and networking were facilitated by her companion and housekeeper, Elizabeth Ellett, whose loyalty over fifty years liberated Bishop from domestic chores, enabling her to develop a multi-faceted career while at the same time enjoying a well organized home life. Her dinner parties became legendary: carefully constructed occasions for introducing like minds or sparking controversy. She died of bronchopneumonia at Queen Mary's University Hospital, Roehampton, on 7 June 1993, and was buried at Putney Vale cemetery. A memorial service was held in St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 4 October 1993.<br>
