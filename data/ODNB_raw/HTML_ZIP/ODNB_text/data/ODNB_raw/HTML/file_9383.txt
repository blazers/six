<span class="headword">Field,  Frederick</span>  (1801&#150;1885), <span class="occ">patristics scholar</span>, was born in London on 20 July 1801, one of eight surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9386/', "Henry Field (1755&#150;1837)")</script>, an apothecary, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barron (<i>d</i>. 1834), of Woolacre House, near Deptford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9381/', "Barron Field")</script>, the chief justice of Gibraltar, was his brother. Through his grandfather John Field he was a direct descendant of Oliver Cromwell, John Field having married Anne Cromwell. He was sent, aged six, to Christ's Hospital, where his father was medical officer and where he was taken by the headmaster as a private pupil. He left Christ's Hospital in 1819 to matriculate at Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1823 he was tenth wrangler, chancellor's classical medallist, and Tyrwhitt's Hebrew scholar. In 1824 he was elected a fellow of Trinity at the same time as T. B. Macaulay. Perhaps because of his increasing deafness (which began early in life, and which later became so aggravated that he avoided all social intercourse), he did no official teaching in his college, although he was examiner for the classical tripos in 1833 and 1837 and read with private pupils (including F. D. Maurice).<br>
<br>Field was ordained in 1828 by Kaye, bishop of Lincoln; from then onwards he devoted himself almost entirely to biblical and patristical studies, being especially known for his work on Chrysostom and Origen. His first work was his valuable edition of Chrysostom's <span class="italic">Homilies on St Matthew</span> (3 vols., 1839), providing an improved critical Greek text. Shortly afterwards he ceased to reside in Cambridge, and for the next twenty-four years he combined parochial duties with his academic work. For three years he officiated in the small parish of Great Saxham in Suffolk, then in 1842 he was presented by Trinity College to the rectory of Reepham in Norfolk. Here he lived a respected and valued life for twenty-one years, dividing his time between his pastoral duties and various theological works. His own lifestyle was by choice simple and modest; he devoted his resources instead to improving and enlarging the chancel of his church, and building a school which was maintained chiefly at his own expense.<br>
<br>Field's main work while he was at Reepham was his edition of Chrysostom's <span class="italic">Homilies on St Paul's Epistles</span> (7 vols., 1845&#150;62), which followed the same structure as the <span class="italic">Homilies on St Matthew</span>, and was published in the Oxford <span class="roman">Library of the Fathers</span>. He next undertook a new edition of the fragments of Origen's <span class="italic">Hexapla</span>. As he was well aware that this work would require the whole of his attention for many years, he resigned his living in 1863, and moved to Norwich, where he continued to live until his death. Although Origen's <span class="italic">Hexapla</span> was an important witness to the original text of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, obtaining funding for the project proved difficult. Eventually sponsorship was provided by Oxford's Clarendon Press. The work was completed in 1874 as <span class="italic">Origenis hexaplorum quae supersunt</span> (2 vols., 1867&#150;75) and remained the most comprehensive and extensive collection of the fragments for over a century; it also included a highly informative prolegomena.<br>
<br>During his endeavours to gain approval for the project, Field published the pamphlet <span class="italic">Otium Norvicense</span> (1864), with parts 2 and 3 appearing in 1876 and 1881, and a fourth (published posthumously) in 1897. The work functioned as a synthesis of his research into readings of the Greek text of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, often with reference to knowledge gained from classical literature. In part 4 he claimed to have been the first person to reintroduce the ancient interpretation of <span class="roman">Mark</span> 7: 18 which was adopted wholesale in the Revised Version of 1881, forty years after Field had first revived it. On the basis of his edition of the <span class="italic">Hexapla</span>, recognized as one of the most important contributions made to patristic scholarship over the course of the century, Field was made an LLD of Cambridge and an honorary fellow of his college. He was offered a DCL by Oxford University, but he declined to attend the ceremony.<br>
<br>Field's age and deafness also prevented his attending meetings with fellow members of the committee for the revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, to which he had been appointed in 1870. He was none the less a useful colleague, sending notes and suggestions. He lived to see the work finished, but died, unmarried, on 19 April 1885, at his home in Carlton Terrace, Heigham, Norwich, a few weeks before it was published. A brass tablet was left by his sister in Reepham church and another memorial tablet was placed in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>In Field's own short account of his life (in the preface to the edition of Origen's <span class="italic">Hexapla</span>) there is a dignified simplicity, and no complaint at having failed to receive ecclesiastical honours. He describes himself as a faithful member of the Church of England; as having avoided the extremes of evangelical, rationalist, ritualist, and Catholic approaches. He was probably one of the most eminent and learned of nineteenth-century patristic scholars and was described by Christopher Wordsworth, bishop of Lincoln, as &#145;the Jerome of the Anglican Church&#146;. The unusual combination of Greek with oriental scholarship made his opinion especially valuable. He was critical of the revision of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, partly because he felt there were many needless verbal alterations, but mainly because he disagreed with the historical methods used, as was made clear in his <span class="italic">Letter to the Rev Philip Schaff, DD, President of the American Committee on Revision</span> which was printed for private circulation in 1881.<br>
