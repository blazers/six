<span class="headword">Nicolson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cory]</span>,  Adela Florence</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Laurence Hope]</span>  (1865&#150;1904), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Stoke House, Stoke Bishop, Gloucestershire, on 9 April 1865. She was the daughter of Arthur Cory (<i>d</i>. 1903), colonel in the Indian army, and his wife, Elizabeth Fanny Griffin (1834&#150;1916). Her sister was the novelist Victoria Cross [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56880/', "Cory, Annie Sophie")</script>]. She was educated with her elder sister Isabel, at a boarding-school in Montague Road, Richmond, run by a Belgian, Jacques Philippart, and at the age of sixteen joined her parents in Lahore, India. Here she worked with her father on the <span class="italic">Civil and Military Gazette</span>, later to be associated with the Kiplings. In 1889 she married Colonel Malcolm Hassels Nicolson of the Bengal army<a href="#cosubject_35240"> [<i>see below</i>]</a> and settled at Madras. Her poetry was published under the pseudonym Laurence Hope, and it was not until after her death that the poems were published in her name. Her first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The Garden of Kama and other Love Lyrics from India</span>, was published in 1901. Generally reviewed as the work of a man, it attracted enormous attention and was repeatedly reissued every year for the next fourteen years. While the substance of the poems is not drawn from any identifiable Indian source, the exotic settings emphasized a passionate intensity which was seen as oriental. The influence of Swinburne and the Pre-Raphaelites can also be discerned in this and later works.<br>
<br>After spending some time in north Africa Adela Nicolson published <span class="italic">Stars of the Desert</span> (1903); in that year she met Thomas Hardy, who greatly admired her work, and with whom she corresponded until her death. He wrote a preface for <span class="italic">Indian Love</span>, a volume of her poetry; it was published posthumously in 1905, but Hardy's preface was not included. Some of her shorter poems, such as &#145;Four Indian Love Lyrics&#146; in the musical setting of Amy Woodforde Finden (1860&#150;1919), continued to be very popular into the 1930s and were recorded by, among others, John MacCormack, Dame Clara Butt, and Rudolph Valentino. After her husband's death in August 1904 Nicolson suffered from depression and committed suicide by consuming perchloride of mercury on 4 October 1904 at Dunmore House, Teynampet, Madras. She was buried, like her husband, in St Mary's cemetery, Madras. Her only son, Malcolm Josceline Nicolson, subsequently edited her poems.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_35240"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm Hassels Nicolson</span>  (1843&#150;1904)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Major Malcolm Nicolson (1792&#150;1850), 30th Bengal lancers, and his second wife, Caroline Yates (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of Major-General Richard Hassells Yates, Madras army, was born on 11 June 1843. He joined the army in 1859 as ensign in the Bombay infantry and was promoted lieutenant in 1862. His first active service was in the Abyssinian expedition of 1867&#150;8; he was present at the action at Azogel and at the capture of Magdala, and received the Abyssinian medal. He attained the rank of captain in 1869. During the Anglo-Afghan War of 1878&#150;80 he took part in the occupation of Kandahar and fought at Ahmed Khel and Ursu. He was mentioned in dispatches, and in 1879 was promoted to the rank of major. After the war he received the Afghan medal with one clasp, and in March 1881 the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel; he became army-colonel in 1885 and substantive colonel in 1894. For his services in the Zhob valley campaign of 1890 he was again mentioned in dispatches, and was made CB in 1891. From 1891 to 1894 he was aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria, being promoted major-general in the latter year and lieutenant-general in 1899. He died on 7 August 1904 at Mackay's Gardens Nursing Home, Madras, and was buried in St Mary's cemetery. General Nicolson was an expert linguist, having passed the interpreter's test in Baluchi, Brahui, and Persian, and the higher standard in Pushtu.<br>
