<span class="headword">Leighton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1610), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was a son of John Leighton of Wattlesborough, Shropshire (<i>d</i>. 1532), esquire of the body to Henry VIII and MP for Shropshire, and his wife, Joyce, daughter of Edward Sutton, second Baron Dudley. Like Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick, and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, Thomas Leighton was a great-great-grandson of John Sutton, first Baron Dudley. His career was strongly influenced by family connections, which placed him at the core of the Dudley clientele. It may be inferred that he was a conspirator against the crown in Mary's reign and implicated in the plot of 1555&#150;6 led by his first cousin Henry Dudley. In 1559 Elizabeth I named Leighton, along with known plotters exiled in France, as &#145;serviceable&#146; and welcome to return to England. In summer 1560 Leighton served as captain of 200 foot soldiers during the Scottish campaign  (TNA: PRO, SP 70/59/3). He may earlier have fought for Henri II in the war with England (1557&#150;9): in 1563, when seeking to lead a force of 100 lances, he noted &#145;that is the kynd of servis I have been broght up in and do most love, besides I knowe as well as most men the manner of the servis of the Frenche with all the contry&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Leighton's French language skills, which were to shape his career, probably originated in this period. In October 1562 he served with distinction at Rouen, commanding the English forces sent to aid the Huguenots. At the capture of Rouen he was wounded and taken prisoner, avoiding the galleys or worse by the intercession of Henri, comte de Damville. He was exchanged, only to be named as one of the English hostages upon Warwick's withdrawal from Le Havre in 1563. A recommendation from the Dudleys resulted in a captaincy for Leighton in Henry Sidney's colonizing enterprise in Ireland (1565&#150;7); he also became a member of the corporation for the settlement of Munster. Connections at court brought more substantial returns. Leighton had been named by William Cecil in his list of Leicester's particular friends, which can now be dated to spring 1565, and he was created a gentleman of the privy chamber in 1568. In May of that year Elizabeth sent him to Mary, queen of Scots, and the earl of Moray to encourage a composition between their parties.<br>
<br>Leighton served near Pontefract in suppressing the northern uprising of 1569. He was appointed governor of Guernsey on 14 April 1570 and took up residence, over the years advancing works at Castle Cornet (where he employed the engineer Paul Ivy) and encouraging the island's developing presbyterian polity. The natives persistently challenged many aspects of his government, particularly in the decade 1579&#150;89; generally Leighton enjoyed the privy council's support in these disputes. He also continued in favour in diplomatic affairs, and was employed on an embassy in 1574 seeking to reconcile Charles IX with Alen&ccedil;on. In 1577 he visited the Low Countries to encourage peace between the states and Don John of Austria.<br>
<br>In 1578 Leighton married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys, a gentlewoman of the privy chamber and first cousin once removed of the queen. His wife's sister Lettice, countess of Essex, married Leicester in the same year. Leighton was knighted in May 1579. The scurrilous <span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth</span> (1584) inevitably characterized him as one of the earl's &#145;most obliged dependents&#146;  (Peck, 105). In 1585 the queen granted him the manor and park of Feckenham, Worcestershire. He was sent to represent the Huguenot cause before Henri III in June 1588. Diplomatic responsibilities did not diminish military obligations, and later that summer Leighton was a commissioner organizing defences and a senior officer of the royal camp at Tilbury. He was made deputy in Normandy to the earl of Essex in 1591. Trusted by the queen to supervise her favourite's military ardour, and prey to gout, Leighton found himself in exasperating circumstances.<br>
<br>Leighton's governorship did not bring unmixed relief. He and Guernsey's royal court once more were in dispute before the privy council in 1597. Again Leighton emerged with honour. He may well have felt some satisfaction in providing a refuge for the eminent puritan Thomas Cartwright, whom he employed as chaplain at Castle Cornet (1595&#150;1601). He devoted other energies to preserving game on the island of Herm; sadly in 1597 this retreat saw the drowning, with his tutor Isaac Daubeney, of Walter St John, son of Leighton's daughter Elizabeth, the wife of John St John. Leighton's other child, Thomas, married Mary, daughter of Edward, eleventh Baron Zouche. Lord Zouche acted in 1600&#150;01 as Leighton's lieutenant in Guernsey. Thomas junior also served as lieutenant, being sworn in on 10 September 1604. The latter died in Guernsey and was buried in St Peter Port church on 25 September 1617.<br>
<br>Leighton joined the council in the marches of Wales in 1601. In the same year he was appointed to the quorum on the commission of the peace of Worcestershire. He represented the shire in the parliament of 1601 where, appropriately given his puritan convictions, he was appointed to committees for bills for penal reform and against blasphemous swearing. The ill-fated bill for prohibiting the transport and sale abroad of iron ordnance touched Leighton's own patent. The stout defence of the royal prerogative made before the Commons by his father-in-law, Sir Francis Knollys, and the bill's failure, cannot have been unwelcome.<br>
<br>Leighton's waning status under James I was symptomized by concessions made to Guernsey's authorities in 1607&#150;8. Less significance may have attached to his military office at the former frontier, and his puritanism may also have lost him favour. He was elderly, and his one-time patron long beyond secular influence. Leighton died in Guernsey and was buried in the parish church of St Peter Port on 1 February 1610. The record of this referred, in French, to his government of the island as &#145;fortunate&#146;. An early modern interlineation has altered the meaning to &#145;most unfortunate&#146;. Traditionally Leighton was recalled in Guernsey with just such rancour, notwithstanding his distinction and his contributions to the island's military security and religious independence. In England he is barely remembered at all.<br>
