<span class="headword">Davies,  John</span>  (1625&#150;1693), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born at Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, on 25 May 1625. He was the son of William Davies, yeoman of Kidwelly, and his wife, whose maiden name was Griffiths. He attended school in Carmarthen and entered Jesus College, Oxford, on 16 May 1641, matriculating on 4 June. When the civil war broke out he was removed from Oxford by relatives, and placed in St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 14 May 1646. Wood claims that there he was trained up by presbyterians which &#145;made him ever after, till his majesty's restoration, keep pace with the times of usurpation&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 382). At Cambridge he became acquainted with the Durham poet John Hall, who was at St John's in 1645/6. Davies wrote the preface to Hall's book of essays, <span class="italic">Horae vacivae</span> (1646), claiming that this work represented not only the learning of the university but that of the more serious sort of men in three nations. It was through Hall that Davies acquired the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Ancient Rites, and Monuments of the Monastical, Cathedral Church of Durham</span>, which he translated from the Latin and published in 1672, dedicating it to another native of Durham, James Mickleton, of the Inner Temple. Davies's fluency in French came from the years he spent in France during the interregnum. After the Restoration, Davies wrote <span class="italic">The civil warres of Great Britain and Ireland: containing an exact history of their occasion, originall, progress, and happy end</span> (1661), which he dedicated to the duke of Richmond and Lennox. Davies claims that this work is an unbiased and impartial account of the wars, although it contains a hagiographical account of Charles I's execution:<blockquote>Then after some short discourse with Doctor Juxon, his Majesty with an Heroick patience submitted his Head to the Block, which after the Sign given, was at one blow cut off &hellip; Thus fell Charles &hellip; the Martyr of the People, a Prince certainly endowed with much piety, magnanimity and patience, as any that ever this kingdom could boast. (pp. 280, 282)</blockquote>A Scottish edition of the work was published in 1664.It appears that Davies earned his living by translating works from French, Spanish, and Latin. The first of these was <span class="italic">The Extravagant Shepherd</span> from the French of C. Sorel (1653). He translated an esoteric selection of works, which included <span class="italic">The Art of How to Know Men</span> (1665), originally by De La Chambre, dedicated to Charles Howard, earl of Carlisle, recommending it to him for the use of ambassadors. Other works Davies translated also had a practical function, such as <span class="italic">The voyages &amp; travels of the ambassadors sent by Frederick duke of Holstein, to the great duke of Muscovy, and the king of Persia</span>, dedicated to the &#145;English Merchants in Muscovy&#146;, which was published together with the <span class="italic">Travel of John Albert de Mandelslo</span> in 1662. Davies also translated novels and pseudo-scientific works such as <span class="italic">The History of Magick</span> (1657).<br>
<br>Davies hoped to gain the patronage of well-connected men through his translations. <span class="italic">Observations on the Poems of Homer and Virgil</span> (1672), translated from the French of Ren&eacute; Rapin, was dedicated to Sir John Berkenhead, <span class="italic">The History of Appian</span> (1679), a translation of the work of Appianus, to the earl of Ossory, and <span class="italic">The History of Henry IV</span> (1663), from the French of the bishop of Rodez, to Charles II. Davies did not forget his countrymen or his relatives. It is from the dedications to his translations that the few details known about his life can be reconstructed. Murtada's <span class="italic">The Egyptian History</span> (1672) was dedicated to his uncle John Griffith, of Llangwendraeth, Carmarthenshire, whom Davies had entertained with stories from the book, and to whom it was now dedicated as recompense for Griffith's having lost his collection of papers and books on Wales. <span class="italic">Political and Military Observations</span> (1679) was dedicated to Sir Thomas Davies, a bookseller and mayor of London. Davies was acquainted with Nahum Tate and Richard Lovelace, the latter writing a prefatory verse for <span class="italic">Letters of Affaires of Love and Courtship</span> (1657), translated from the French of Vincent de Voiture. The translations were workmanlike. Davies hoped they were pure, simple, and sensible. Davies was buried in Kidwelly church on 22 July 1693.<br>
