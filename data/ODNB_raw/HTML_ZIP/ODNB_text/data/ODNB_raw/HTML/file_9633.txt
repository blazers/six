<span class="headword">FitzRoy <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Palmer]</span>,  George</span>, duke of Northumberland  (1665&#150;1716), <span class="occ">courtier and army officer</span>, was born on 28 December 1665 at Merton College, Oxford, the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28285/', "Barbara Palmer, countess of Castlemaine (bap. 1640, d. 1709)")</script>. For the first few years of his life he was officially the son of his mother's husband, Roger Palmer, earl of Castlemaine, but from his baptism he was acknowledged as the son of the king, and after his mother was created duchess of Cleveland in 1670 he became known as Lord George FitzRoy. On 1 October 1674 he was created Baron Pontefract, Viscount Falmouth, and earl of Northumberland.<br>
<br>The choice of Northumberland as a title was probably an aggressive negotiating tactic in his mother's unsuccessful stratagem to win Elizabeth, the heiress of the Percy earls of Northumberland, as her son's wife. Northumberland was encouraged by Charles II to travel on the continent. He visited Venice in 1681 and was a volunteer on the French side during Louis XIV's campaign in the Netherlands in 1683 and 1684, serving at Courtrai and at the siege of Luxembourg. On 6 April 1683 Charles II created him duke of Northumberland, and on 10 January 1684 KG. Soon after his return he and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9636/', "Henry FitzRoy, first duke of Grafton")</script>, attempted to end their mother's relationship with the actor Cardell Goodman by having him arrested, first for highway robbery, and then for attempting to poison the brothers, but they failed to end the attachment.<br>
<br>John Evelyn met Northumberland at about this time and described him as &#145;of all his majesty's children the most accomplished and worth the knowing&#146;, &#145;extraordinary handsome and well-shaped&#146;, and skilled in horsemanship  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 24 Oct and 18 Dec 1684). He was appointed captain and colonel of the second troop of Life Guards on 11 February 1685. James II was reported as intending that Northumberland should marry a daughter of Henry Cavendish, second duke of Newcastle, but plans for an advantageous match were ended in March 1686 when it was disclosed that Northumberland had married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1714), the widow of Thomas Lucy, of Charlecote in Warwickshire, a captain in the Horse Guards, and the daughter of Robert Wheatley of Bracknell, Berkshire, who, according to Edward Harley, was &#145;a poulterer near Fleet Bridge&#146;  (Edward Harley to Sir Edward Harley, 20 March 1686, <span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.395). The date of the marriage is uncertain, but it may have taken place as early as 8 April 1685. His brother Henry, duke of Grafton, arranged for the duchess to be kidnapped and taken to a convent in Ghent, possibly with Northumberland's connivance, in the hope that she could be induced to deny the marriage, but she was brought back when James II indicated that he regarded the marriage as binding. The Northumberlands had no children.<br>
<br>In November 1688 Northumberland was made lord of the bedchamber to James II. He remained loyal to the king, and was in attendance on the night of 10 December 1688 when James fled from Whitehall. He did not follow him, and sat in the Lords during the Convention Parliament. Although he lost his command of the Horse Guards to James Butler, second duke of Ormond, Northumberland was not totally eclipsed under William III and was reported to be travelling to the Netherlands with Ormond in May 1689, having secured a pension of &pound;3000 a year from the excise to add to the &pound;2350 he was already receiving from the Post Office. In 1701 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Surrey, constable of Windsor Castle and Park, and ranger of Windsor Forest. Under Anne he was also keeper of Hampton Court Palace.<br>
<br>Northumberland was able to complement his household appointments with a renewed military career under Anne, although it is uncertain whether he ever took the field during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was appointed colonel of the Royal Horse Guards on 13 March 1703 on the death of Aubrey de Vere, twentieth earl of Oxford, was promoted major-general on 27 April 1708, and when Ormond became captain-general in January 1712 was restored as captain and colonel of the second Life Guards. Northumberland was a tory who voted against the impeachment of Sacheverell in 1710. He was given the lord lieutenancy of Berkshire in 1712 and became a privy councillor in August 1713. Following the accession of George I in 1714, however, he lost the lieutenancies, his posts at Windsor, and his place on the privy council, and in February 1715 he was replaced at the head of the second Life Guards by Algernon Seymour, earl of Hertford.<br>
<br>The duchess of Northumberland had died on 25 May 1714, and by 10 March 1715 Northumberland had married Mary Dutton. He died, childless, at Epsom, Surrey, on 28 June 1716, and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 July. His widow died at Frogmore, Northumberland's house in Windsor Great Park, on 27 August 1738.<br>
