<span class="headword">David</span>, earl of Huntingdon and lord of Garioch  (1152&#150;1219), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the youngest in the family of three sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12956/', "Prince Henry of Scotland (c.1115&#150;1152)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50012/', "Ada de Warenne (c.1123&#150;1178)")</script>. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7208/', "David I")</script>, in whose honour he was named, and his elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17860/', "Malcolm IV")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion")</script>, were successive kings of Scots from 1124 to 1214. He enthusiastically adopted Anglo-Norman values and played an ample supporting role in transforming Scotland into a stronger, European-style kingdom. Sent as a hostage to the English court in July 1163, he returned to Scotland as heir apparent to William the Lion immediately after his accession in 1165. Although never formally designated William's successor, David regularly attested royal charters as chief lay witness, and was occasionally named with his brother in the exercise of authority. His responsibilities were substantially increased by grants of extensive territories in outlying regions where William vigorously sought to consolidate and extend his control.<br>
<br>In 1174 David gained the earldom of Lennox, which he held in the king's name until it was restored to its native house, perhaps in 1185. It has been suggested that David was formally granted Lennox in custody during a minority, but it seems more likely that his role was to enforce royal authority following a pronouncement of forfeiture (later rescinded) against the earldom's rulers. By 1182 he had taken charge of imposing estates on Tayside and in mid-Aberdeenshire, where he controlled the &#145;frontier&#146; district of Garioch, his principal Scottish power base, important as a centre of operations, defensive and offensive, against the men of Moray and Ross to the north. These acquisitions, centred on the castle-burghs he established at Dundee and at Inverurie (the caput of Garioch), guaranteed his place as one of the kingdom's greatest magnates; and as he strengthened his local influence through innovations on the Anglo-Norman model, so he contributed in good measure to the increasing might of the crown, especially by reinforcing its dominance north of the Mounth (the eastern Grampians). But Scotland was scarcely his entire world. From 1163 his career had continued to unfold under the influence of Anglo-Scottish relations, often in the context of the difficulties raised by Scottish claims to the northern English counties, and by English counter-claims to the overlordship of Scotland. He was knighted by Henry II at Windsor on 31 May 1170 and, together with William the Lion, pledged allegiance to the English king's son, the young King Henry, on 15 June, the day after the latter's coronation. Apparently with some reluctance, David returned to England as his brother's ally in April or May 1174 in aid of young Henry's rebellion, begun the year before. In 1173 William had offered David the honour and earldom of Huntingdon; but only the additional grant of Lennox seems to have secured his intervention in this doomed venture. In the event he acquitted himself well: operating from Huntingdon and Leicester he rallied the midland insurgents, imposed his lordship on the Huntingdon honour, and defied Henry II until news of William's capture at Alnwick reached him late in July 1174.<br>
<br>David was a principal party to the treaty of Falaise in December 1174, and in August 1175 went with William the Lion to York, where they publicly acknowledged Henry II as Scotland's lord superior. The Huntingdon honour, confiscated in 1174, was restored to William in March 1185. With Henry II's approval and perhaps at his bidding, William at once transferred it to David with the title of earl. This was the outstanding landmark in his life. As the most powerful Anglo-Scottish magnate of his day, he became a major focus for the increasing Normanization (or Anglicization) of Scottish society, forged &#145;cross-border&#146; property ties that in smaller ways reflected his own, and was conspicuous in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy. Despite his dual allegiance, he never entirely lost William's trust. Admittedly, in 1195 William planned to marry his eldest daughter, Margaret, to Otto von Brunswick (the future emperor Otto IV), on the understanding that Margaret would inherit the kingdom, thus excluding David from the succession. But William's main aim seems to have been not so much to marginalize David as to regain Northumberland and Cumberland, with which King Richard I, Otto's uncle, promised to endow the couple. In any event, William quickly withdrew his proposals when an influential noble faction in Scotland spoke up on David's behalf, and no lasting damage was done to the brothers' friendship. David long remained prominent in Scottish governance, and in February 1206 possibly acted as regent during William's absence.<br>
<br>From 1185, however, David was tenaciously committed to moderating warlike Scottish policies, a stance determined by more than self-interest. His experiences in 1174&#150;5 had impressed on him that peace with the stronger English state was essential to Scotland's well-being&#151;though, ironically, the greater the English government's fears of Scottish belligerence, the more he would profit from English royal favour. He gave unquestioned loyalty to Richard I, who rewarded him with an advantageous marriage to Maud 
    (or Matilda; <i>d</i>. 1233)
  , sister of Ranulf (III), earl of Chester, whom he wed on 19 August 1190. It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that he joined Richard on crusade; and he besieged Richard's enemies at Nottingham in March 1194. He was a war captain in Normandy in July 1194, and served there again in 1197. He was frequently at the English court for discussion of Anglo-Scottish affairs, as on 5 December 1189, when Richard released Scotland from English overlordship. When David's prospects of kingship receded with the birth of William the Lion's long-awaited son, Alexander, in 1198, his standing became more firmly dependent on Anglo-Scottish peace. He worked energetically to this end after King John's succession in 1199, when William demanded the border shires with renewed persistence. Regularly employed by John as an emissary to the Scots between 1199 and 1209, he also supported him in Normandy, Maine and Anjou from 1199 to 1203. During a fresh Anglo-Scottish crisis in 1209 his presence at the Scottish court strengthened the hand of those who urged William to seek an agreement with John at Norham. John's punitive terms undermined the moderates' credibility; but this treaty removed for some time the threat of Scottish aggression.<br>
<br>Since David's usefulness to John had diminished, he now began to fall foul of the English king's arbitrariness and rapacity. In August 1212 they were sufficiently estranged for John to suspect David of conspiring with other magnates apparently to kill him. An implausible assassin, David nevertheless had to surrender Fotheringhay Castle, his chief English seat. The decline of his political influence was accelerated by advancing years and illness. His frailty was noted when, aged sixty-two, he attended Alexander II's inauguration banquet (6&#150;7 December 1214), and he does not appear among the young king's counsellors. He took no known part in the baronial opposition to John at the time of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>; and his rebellion, half-hearted at best, was delayed until after the Scots had invaded in October 1215. He began to make his peace with the English crown in September 1217 and finally received letters of reseisin on 13 March 1218. Praised by Jordan Fantosme for his wisdom and compassion, he was no doubt a conciliator by nature as well as by necessity. He had the grim satisfaction of being proved right when Alexander II's war effort in 1215&#150;17 collapsed. His influence on royal policy making must not be overstated; yet his career demonstrated the possibility of serving Scottish and English interests alike, as well as the personal rewards to be gained from membership of a cross-border &eacute;lite. He thus helped to pave the way for the continuous peace and often friendly contact that characterized Anglo-Scottish relations from 1217 to 1296.<br>
<br>Countess Maud survived her husband and did not remarry, dying in 1233. They had three sons and four daughters. The first and second sons, Henry and David, died in infancy, predeceasing their father. The third son, John of Scotland (1206&#150;1237), became a ward of his uncle, Earl Ranulf (III), was married to Helen, daughter of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, in 1222, and on attaining his majority had livery of the earldom of Huntingdon on 25 April 1227. He was created earl of Chester on 21 November 1232, shortly after the death of Earl Ranulf, whose senior coheir he was, and died childless at Darnhall, Cheshire, in June 1237. He was buried in the chapter house of Chester Abbey. Margaret, the eldest daughter, married in 1209 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan, lord of Galloway")</script>; Isabel married Robert (IV) de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1226&times;33); Maud (or Matilda) married John of Monmouth (<i>d</i>. 1257); and Ada married Henry Hastings (<i>d</i>. 1250). It was from Margaret and Isabel respectively that the houses of Balliol&#151;through the marriage of Margaret's daughter Dervorguilla to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1208/', "John de Balliol (d. 1268)")</script>&#151;and Brus (Bruce) inherited their claims to the throne of Scotland. David also had four known illegitimate children, three sons and a daughter. Earl David died at Yardley Hastings, Northamptonshire, his later English home, on 17 June 1219. He was interred in Sawtry Abbey, Huntingdonshire, though it had apparently been his long-standing wish to be buried in Lindores Abbey, Fife, a monastery of the Tironensian order founded by him <i>c</i>.1190, and colonized from Kelso Abbey.<br>
