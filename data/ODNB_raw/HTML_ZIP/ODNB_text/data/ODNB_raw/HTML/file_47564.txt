<span class="headword">Praed,  William Mackworth</span>  (1747&#150;1833), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born on 24 June 1747 and baptized the following month at the London Foundling Hospital. He was the eldest of six children of Humphrey Mackworth Praed (1718?&#150;1803), MP and banker, and Mary, daughter of William Forester of Dothil Park in Shropshire, and widow of Sir Brian Broughton Delves, baronet, of Broughton in Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College and at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1774 Praed was elected MP for St Ives, the family seat. However, after allegations of bribery the result was declared void and he was unseated. On 19 June 1778 he married Elizabeth Tyringham (1749&#150;1811), daughter of a banker, Barnaby Backwell of Tyringham in Buckinghamshire, at St George's, Hanover Square. Elizabeth had just inherited the family estate at Tyringham after the death of her brother, and this became the family home. William and Elizabeth were to have twenty children, only seven of whom reached their majority. In 1792 the old manor house was pulled down and a new one built by Sir John Soane.<br>
<br>In July 1779 Praed became a junior partner of his father's bank, the Cornish Bank at Truro. In 1802 shortly before his father's death he became the senior partner, and soon afterwards opened a second branch at Falmouth, known as the Cornish Naval Bank. In 1780 he was again elected MP for St Ives, and remained so until 1806. He usually supported the Pitt ministry, but was best known for guiding enabling legislation for the Grand Junction Canal through the House of Commons. This important canal linked London and the midlands, and Praed was noted for his obsession with its success. For his work in parliament he was awarded a piece of plate by the canal shareholders, and, in 1813, in honour of his work as the company chairman, his portrait was commissioned for the boardroom. In 1801 he also became one of the company treasurers. In 1808 he was a leading proponent of the Grand Union Canal which linked the Grand Junction Canal and the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal. After 1823 he no longer attended meetings of the Grand Junction Canal Company, but his sons and London banking partners retained a close interest on his behalf. Praed Street in Paddington, where the canal terminated, is another memorial of his enthusiasm.<br>
<br>In 1801 William Praed formed a banking partnership with Philip Box, Kendon Digby, and Benjamin Babbage, and opened a bank at 189 Fleet Street, London, the building being designed by Sir John Soane. There were several changes of partner, but Praed was always the senior partner, and he brought other members of the family into the firm. Many of the bank's customers came from the west country or Buckinghamshire, and the bank provided treasurers, lent money, and invested in shares for the Grand Junction Canal. After 1850 the bank traded as Praed &amp; Co., and it was taken over by Lloyds in 1891.<br>
<br>In 1803 his father died and Praed inherited the family estate at Trevethow, but he disposed of it soon afterwards to Sir Christopher Hawkins, and gave up representing St Ives. Instead he stood for election in the closed borough of Banbury in Oxfordshire. In 1806 he won this seat, ousting Dudley North, but in 1807 there was a double return, and Praed was ousted by North in the fresh election ordered in 1808. He was never an MP thereafter. He concentrated on his other activities, but during the 1820s he may have withdrawn from active management, as his sons took on more responsibility. Near the end of his life he may have retired to Trevethow, which had been acquired once more, for he died there on 9 October 1833, and was buried at the local parish church in Lelant. His eldest son, James Backwell Praed, inherited the estate at Tyringham, and his father's banking interests, while another son, William Tyringham Praed, was also involved in the London banking firm, and became treasurer to the Grand Junction Canal Company.<br>
