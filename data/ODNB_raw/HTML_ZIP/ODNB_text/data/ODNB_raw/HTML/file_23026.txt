<span class="headword">Rainey,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1801, <em>d.</em> 1884), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, the son of Robert and Mary Rainey, was baptized on 25 February 1801 at Spilsby, Lincolnshire, and was sent to school at Louth. He was apprenticed to a doctor first at Horncastle and afterwards at Spilsby, where he supplemented his schooling with a course of self-education in Latin, Greek, and mathematics, as well as in medicine. After serving as assistant to Thomas Barker, a surgeon at Spilsby, and adding to his income by private teaching, he entered with very low funds as a student of St Thomas's Hospital in 1824, still supporting himself chiefly by tuition. He obtained the membership of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827.<br>
<br>For the next ten years Rainey was an active and very successful private teacher of anatomy. In 1837 his health broke down, and, being threatened with consumption, he travelled to the south of Europe, where he lived for five years, mainly in Italy. On returning to London he decided not to enter into medical practice, and was appointed curator of the museum and subsequently, in 1846, demonstrator of anatomy and of the microscope at St Thomas's Hospital, an appointment which he held until his death. For some years before his death he was in receipt of a government pension for his services to science.<br>
<br>Rainey was one of the old school of pure anatomists who had no other profession, and for many years was recognized as one of the ablest anatomical teachers in London. While closely occupied in teaching, scientific research was almost his sole recreation. One of his favourite subjects of enquiry was the production of organic or quasi-organic forms by physical processes, and the deposition of mineral substances in organized bodies. On this he published a book, <span class="italic">On the mode of formation of shells, of bone, and other structures by molecular coalescence, demonstrable by certain artificially formed products</span> (1858), as well as other works. These researches were important, not only as to their immediate object, but also in explaining the formation of urinary calculi, and leading to subsequent researches on this subject, especially those of Vandyke Carter and Ord.<br>
<br>Another of Rainey's early researches was published as <span class="italic">An experimental enquiry into the cause of the ascent and descent of the sap, with observations on endosmose and exosmose</span> (1847). To elucidate these and similar processes he made experiments extending over many years on &#145;the existence of continued currents in fluids, and their action in certain natural physical processes&#146;, described in four papers in the <span class="italic">St Thomas's Hospital Reports</span> (vols. 1, 2, 3, and 5).<br>
<br>Rainey also published several papers on points of minute anatomy, normal and pathological, in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (140, 1850; 147, 1857), <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> (5, 1846), the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span> (vols. 28, 29, 31, and 32), <span class="italic">Transactions of the Pathological Society</span> (vols. 3, 4, 5, and 6), and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Rainey was an indefatigable observer with the microscope, and taught its use to students as early as 1846, when the instrument was little used in medicine. He was celebrated for his skill in the use of minute injections, and published some papers in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science</span>. His name was commemorated in &#145;Rainey's capsules&#146;, a term which was often quoted, especially in German pathological works, referring to minute parasites (later known as psorosperms) which he detected in the muscles. All his work was characterized by the most scrupulous accuracy and conscientiousness.<br>
<br>A man of simple habits, absorbed in scientific pursuits, Rainey lived a somewhat solitary life, but among his friends were Thomas Hodgkin, the physician, Richard Grainger, the physiologist, and Sir Richard Owen, who valued Rainey's work very highly. His own immediate pupils, among them John Syer Bristowe and William Ord, gratefully acknowledged the value of his stimulus and guidance in scientific research, and of his powerful moral influence, which was dominant over many generations of students. Rainey was married to Martha Dee; they had two sons, William (1852&#150;1936) and James. Rainey died on 16 November 1884 at 86 Somerleyton Road, Brixton, London.<br>
