<span class="headword">Carr,  Frank Osmond</span>  (1858&#150;1916), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 23 April 1858 in the school house, Kirkstall, Hunslet, Yorkshire, the second son of George Saxton Carr, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Margaret Durden Carr, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Painter. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, in 1877 and graduated BMus in 1884, having meanwhile been accepted at Downing College, Cambridge, in 1882 and gained a BA there in 1883. In 1885 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, and gained an MA and BMus in 1886, before returning to Oxford, where he finally received his DMus in 1891. He made an initial foray into the London musical theatre in 1889 with the burlesque comic opera <span class="italic">Faddimir</span>, which he composed under the pseudonym Oscar Neville in collaboration with his fellow Cambridge graduate Arthur Reed Ropes (1859&#150;1933), who was to become known as Adrian Ross, the lyricist. The work brought Carr to the attention of the impresario George Edwardes, and led to commissions for the scores of the burlesque <span class="italic">Joan of Arc, or, The Merry Maid of Orleans</span> (1891) and the musical farce <span class="italic">In Town</span> (1892). Part comic opera, part variety show, the latter had a score by Carr that was praised for its pretty ballads, tuneful songs, and sprightly dances. It ran for several months and came to be regarded as the first modern-dress &#145;musical comedy&#146;. A successor, <span class="italic">Morocco Bound</span> (1893), ran for even longer and resulted in Carr being selected as the collaborator of W. S. Gilbert on the more ambitious comic opera <span class="italic">His Excellency</span> (1894). Inevitably Carr was judged no match for Sullivan, though the work achieved a fair international success. Thereafter Carr's star declined almost as rapidly as it had risen. He composed scores for several further musical shows, including <span class="italic">Lord Tom Noddy</span> (1896) for Little Tich, but these were either unsuccessful in London or confined to the provinces. His other published compositions included songs, instrumental pieces, and the score for the ballet <span class="italic">Sir Roger de Coverley</span>, produced at the Empire Theatre in 1907. In later years he sought in vain to revise his older successes for production in the currently popular revue style. In August 1916 he left London to spend some time in the country but died suddenly of a heart attack at the Chequers Hotel, Uxbridge, on 29 August.<br>
