<span class="headword">Davidson,  Thomas</span>  (1838&#150;1870), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Oxnam Row, near Oxnam Water, a tributary of the Teviot, about 4 miles from Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, on 7 July 1838, the son of Jonah Davidson, a shepherd from Wooler, Northumberland. His mother, of whom further details are unknown, came from Belford in the same county. He was educated at various village schools and, having displayed a passionate love of books along with an interest in writing poetry in his early years, he was sent in 1854 to the Nest Academy at Jedburgh. He studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1855 to 1859. In 1859 he won the second prize in his rhetoric class for the poem &#145;Ariadne at Naxos&#146;, which one of his friends sent without his knowledge to Thackeray, who published it with an illustration in the December 1860 issue of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Davidson had early formed a resolution to enter the ministry and in 1859 began the first of the prescribed five autumnal sessions of the theological course of the United Presbyterian church. Between sessions he was assistant schoolmaster at Forres (1859&#150;61) and later in Dr Douglas's School, Edinburgh (1861&#150;3). During this period he continued writing poetry, and his songs and poems were published in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>. Davidson was licensed as a preacher on 2 February 1864, and in accordance with church regulations spent the next few years travelling extensively and preaching at various churches in Scotland, England, and Ireland. Many poems resulted from his travelling experiences, such as the humorous &#145;Yang-Tsi-Kiang&#146; used by the supporters of Carlyle in the contest for the lord rectorship of the university, and popular as a students' song.<br>
<br>A cold caught in June 1866 seriously affected Davidson's health and he retired to Jedburgh in December to recuperate. He was an invalid for more than three years, during which he wrote memorable, mournful songs such as the love ballad &#145;Myspie's Den&#146; and &#145;Auld Ash Tree&#146;, many of which were published in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>. He died of consumption on 29 April 1870 at Bank End, Jedburgh, and was buried at the new cemetery, Jedburgh. Some of his poems were republished in his memoir by John Brown in 1877.<br>
