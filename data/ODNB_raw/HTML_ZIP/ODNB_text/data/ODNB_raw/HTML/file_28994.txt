<span class="headword">Weldon,  Walter</span>  (1832&#150;1885), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 31 October 1832 at Loughborough, the eldest son of Reuben Weldon, manufacturer, and his wife, Esther Fowke. He was employed for some years in his father's business, and on 14 March 1854 at Wirksworth, Derbyshire, he married Annie Cotton (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1881) daughter of John Cotton, cordwainer; they had three children.<br>
<br>Shortly after his marriage Weldon went to London as a journalist. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Dial</span>, afterwards incorporated with the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, an influential Liberal daily newspaper of the time. On 1 August 1860 he issued the first number of a sixpenny monthly magazine called <span class="italic">Weldon's Register of Facts and Occurrences Relating to Literature, the Sciences, and the Arts</span>, by which he hoped primarily to record scientific facts and discoveries in a popular form. Although ably conducted, it proved a failure, and was abandoned in 1864. Among the contributors were George Augustus Sala, Edmund Yates, William Michael Rossetti, James Hain Friswell, and Percy Greg.<br>
<br>About this time, probably through the influence of a friend and fellow-Swedenborgian, Charles Townsend Hook, a paper manufacturer of Snodland, near Rochester, Weldon became interested in technological chemistry. Without any formal or practical training, he began to consider certain industrial problems, particularly chlorine and alkali manufacture, mainly by reading at the British Museum. He took out his first patents for the &#145;manganese-regeneration process&#146;, which eventually made his name famous, before he had ever seen a chemical experiment.<br>
<br>By September 1865 Weldon had devised two new processes for the cheaper manufacture of magnesium and aluminium, but was advised that they were impracticable. In the latter part of 1866 he met the chemical manufacturer David Gamble, and explained, in the chemical language of the day, that he thought he had obtained a &#145;peroxide&#146; of manganese from the &#145;protoxide&#146; by suspending it in water and blowing air through. He was then totally unacquainted with quantitative chemical analysis and the results to be obtained thereby, and did not realize that his process had already been worked on a large scale and found unsatisfactory. The object of Weldon (and of various unsuccessful predecessors) was to regenerate the manganese peroxide used in enormous quantities in the manufacture of chlorine, and converted into a valueless by-product which was discarded.<br>
<br>From this time onwards Weldon carried out experiments on a large scale, first in 1866 at the demolished works of the Walker Chemical Company on the Tyne, and later at those of J. C. Gamble &amp; Co. at St Helens. These led to the &#145;magnesia&#150;manganese&#146; process patented in 1867, and the &#145;lime&#150;manganese&#146; process patented a little later, which was finally adopted, but not worked commercially until 1869. By this latter process ninety to ninety-five per cent of the manganese peroxide formerly lost was recovered, the price of bleaching powder was reduced by &pound;6 per ton, and its production was quadrupled. The essential detail of the process which distinguished it from earlier attempts was the use of an excess of lime over and above that required for the precipitation of the manganese. Jean-Baptiste Dumas, in presenting to Weldon the gold medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale in Paris, said: &#145;By this invention every sheet of paper and every yard of calico throughout the world was cheapened&#146;. In addition, his proposers for membership of the Royal Society cited the invention's &#145;great importance in preventing the pollution of streams and of the atmosphere&#146;  (RS, election certificate, 1882). For his discovery Weldon was also awarded a grand prix at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.<br>
<br>In 1870 the invention of a new chlorine process, &#145;the Deacon process&#146;, by Henry Deacon (<i>d</i>. 1876) and Ferdinand Hurter (1844&#150;1898) led Weldon to fear that his work might be superseded, and he invented another process, known as the &#145;magnesia&#150;chlorine&#146; process, which was developed later at the works at Salindres by Messrs P&eacute;chiney and M. Boulouvard, and was then called the P&eacute;chiney&#150;Weldon process. This process did not prove ultimately successful, while the lime&#150;manganese process was widely employed. In 1880 Weldon read at the Swansea meeting of the British Association an important paper, in which he showed that the heat of formation of compounds increases in nearly all cases with the atomic volume, the heat of formation of equal volumes of different compounds being approximately equal. On 11 July 1883 he was elected president of the Society of Chemical Industry, of which he had been one of the founders in 1881. During the first half of 1884 he voluntarily undertook the laborious duty of abstracting large numbers of patents for the society's journal. On 9 July 1884 he delivered his presidential address at Newcastle upon Tyne on the soda and chlorine industries. A paper on the numerical relations between the atomic weights, read at the Montreal meeting of the British Association, was not published, but in 1885 Weldon printed, for private circulation, the first chapter dealing with the glucinum family, of a memoir &#145;On the ratios &hellip; of the atomic weights.&#146; In it, he attempted to show that the ratios of the atomic weights of the members of a series of elements (Mendeleyev's periodic table) could be expressed by a simple constant. Like his scientific contemporaries Alfred Russel Wallace and Sir William Crookes, Weldon was a believer in spiritualism.<br>
<br>Weldon went, despite illness, to the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association in 1885, but was obliged to return, and died at his house, Rede Hall, Burstow, Surrey, of heart disease on 20 September. He was survived by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36823/', "Walter Frank Raphael Weldon FRS (1860&#150;1906)")</script>, professor of comparative anatomy at Oxford. A second son, Walter Alfred Dante (<i>b</i>. 1862), died suddenly at Cambridge in 1881 shortly before his mother's death. The manganese recovery process has been remembered not only for its intrinsic importance to chemical industry, but as a marvellous achievement by a man without previous training.<br>
