<span class="headword">Buck, Sir  Percy Carter</span>  (1871&#150;1947), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born Percy Hartshorn Buck on 25 March 1871 in West Ham Lane, West Ham, Essex, the son of William Richard Buck, clerk in the War Office, and his wife, Alice Emmeline Wilson. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and in 1891, after studying the organ with Walter Parratt at the Royal College of Music, he won an organ scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he was awarded a BMus in 1892. Although he had completed the work for a DMus by 1893, the degree was not conferred until 1897. After leaving Oxford in 1894 he taught for a short time at Rugby School, taking up the post of organist at Wells Cathedral in 1896. In 1896 he married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1940), eldest daughter of Thomas Bond FRCS, a surgeon at Westminster Hospital: they had three sons (one of whom was killed in the First World War) and two daughters. In 1899 he was appointed organist of Bristol Cathedral.<br>
<br>Buck became director of music at Harrow School in 1901, where he took the line that as very few of his piano pupils were likely to become concert performers, it was more important to turn them into useful musicians: accordingly he taught them to accompany, to transpose, and to extemporize. He also wrote three school songs: &#145;You?&#146;, &#145;Avete&#146;, and &#145;The Silver Arrow&#146;, and several hymn tunes for the Harrow School hymnbook. While at Harrow, Buck began a secret affair with the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31804/', "(Nora) Sylvia Townsend Warner (1893&#150;1978)")</script> which lasted for some seventeen years. Although Buck remained at Harrow until 1927, he took on several part-time positions as well: from 1910 to 1920 he was non-resident professor of music at Trinity College, Dublin, and he joined the staff of the Royal College of Music in 1919, appointed by the new director, Hugh Allen, to teach theory. In 1925 he was appointed King Edward professor of music at the University of London, a chair he held until 1937. Buck was particularly concerned with the training of music teachers, and at the Royal College of Music he helped to set up the teachers' training course, for which he lectured on psychology. In <span class="italic">The Scope of Music</span> (1924), based on his Cramb lectures at the University of Glasgow in 1923, he stressed the importance of the study of psychology for music teachers, and his topics included memory, habit, interest and attention, how to practise, and the art of explaining, with many practical examples and much useful advice. <span class="italic">Psychology for Musicians</span> (1944) remained in print for thirty years. He was also responsible for framing the syllabus of the graduate of the Royal Schools of Music (GRSM) diploma, designed to give school music teachers the same status (and pay) as university graduates. His influence on music education was not confined to the training of music teachers. From 1925 to 1937 he was musical adviser to the education committee of the London county council, and as well as revising the music curriculum in the elementary and secondary schools he selected talented children for music lessons at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music. He was also professor of music at the University of Sheffield from 1927 to 1928.<br>
<br>Buck's other books included <span class="italic">The Organ: a Complete Method for the Study of Technique and Style</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Unfigured Harmony</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">Acoustics for Musicians</span> (1918). He edited the introductory volume (1929) to the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Music</span>, and revised the first two volumes, <span class="italic">The Polyphonic Period</span> (1929 and 1932) of the second edition, originally written by H. E. Woolridge in 1901. He edited the <span class="italic">Oxford Song Book</span>, volume one (1929) and the <span class="italic">Oxford Nursery Song Book</span> (1934), and was co-editor of <span class="italic">The English Psalter</span> (1925). The only organist on the editorial committee of the ten-volume <span class="italic">Tudor Church Music</span> (1922&#150;9), published for the Carnegie Trust, he used his skill as a contrapuntist to supply missing parts. Buck was also a composer, and his published works include three organ sonatas (1896, 1902, and 1904), piano pieces, anthems, and songs. Fourteen of his hymn tunes were used in the 1916 edition of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>. In addition he wrote chamber music, including a string quintet, a piano quartet, and a violin sonata, and an overture, <span class="italic">C&#339;ur de lion</span>: these were unpublished. His books and the manuscripts of many of his early unpublished works were destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War, a loss he felt deeply.<br>
<br>Buck was knighted in 1936. He died on 3 October 1947 in Stoneycrest Nursing Home, Hindhead, Surrey, after a short illness.<br>
