<span class="headword">Bandinel,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">dean of Jersey</span>, settled in Jersey with his English wife, Elizabeth Stallenge, towards the end of the reign of Elizabeth I. Of his earlier life nothing is known beyond his contemporaries' statement that he was Italian. In September 1601 he offered himself to the Calvinist colloquy in Jersey as a candidate for the ministry. He was accepted for the parish of St Brelade and installed there only two months later, so it appears that he had already trained for the ministry elsewhere. He remained there nearly twenty years, during which time his seven children, five sons and two daughters, were born. After St Brelade's he served St Mary's and then St Martin's.<br>
<br>The presbyterian form of church government was not destined to last much longer in the island. James I, on the understanding that this arrangement had been formally sanctioned by Elizabeth, confirmed it in the first year of his reign, but Sir John Peyton, appointed governor of the island by the king in 1603, was soon in conflict with the colloquy over the right of appointment to benefices. In 1614 there was still greater controversy over an appointment made by Peyton: the colloquy's objection in that case was related to the candidate's having received episcopal orders. In the same year delegations went to London, one representing each of the episcopal and presbyterian parties. Bandinel formed part of the delegation favouring the continuation of the presbyterian form of church government, though he accepted the office of dean when it was re-established.<br>
<br>When, on 15 April 1620, Bandinel was sworn into office, he was the first to hold it since John Paulet, who had been appointed under Henry VIII and served into Elizabeth's reign. One of Bandinel's first tasks as dean was to oversee the drawing up of the &#145;canons and constitutions ecclesiastical of the isle of Jersey&#146;. An ecclesiastical court was established, which first met in September 1623, and Bandinel presided at its sittings.<br>
<br>Bandinel's appointment as dean was controversial: there was a heated dispute in the states on the occasion of his swearing in. Some of the rectors in the island objected strongly to what they saw as a non-scriptural innovation in church government. It is hard to determine whether there was much feeling against Bandinel personally, particularly since at least from the time of the contemporary account of island life in the 1640s contained in Jean Chevalier's <span class="italic">Journal</span> he was cast strongly as a troublesome foreigner allowed to hold too much power in the island&#151;a view inspired almost entirely by his quarrel with the lieutenant-governor, Sir Philip de Carteret, and by his involvement in the parliamentary party in Jersey.<br>
<br>De Carteret was appointed by Charles I, and, although a zealous protestant, was always an ardent loyalist. He is said to have been a man of ability and integrity, but of austere manners, and he was accused by his enemies of absorbing all the more lucrative offices in the island. He and the governor, Sir Thomas Jermyn, were charged with having attempted to deprive the dean of part of his tithes, an act which roused Bandinel's animosity to the lieutenant-governor, which was in turn fostered by subsequent events.<br>
<br>During the civil war, Bandinel was among those leaders of the parliamentary party who kept back supplies from the besieged fortresses of Elizabeth Castle and Mont Orgueil, where the lieutenant-governor and his wife were confined. The hardships which he had to endure undermined de Carteret's health, and Bandinel revealed the extent of his bitterness in refusing all spiritual and material comforts to de Carteret in his final illness, keeping even his wife from him until the last moment. When on de Carteret's death in 1643 his son-in-law, Sir George Carteret, became lieutenant-governor in his place, he arrested Bandinel and his eldest son, Jacques, the rector of St Mary, on a charge of treason. The Bandinels were confined first in Elizabeth Castle and afterwards in Mont Orgueil, where, after more than twelve months' imprisonment, they formed a plan for escape. Having knotted together bed linen and other material, on the night of 10 February 1645 they forced their way through the grating of their cell and lowered themselves down the side of their prison. The son succeeded in reaching the end of the line but it was too short and he fell, seriously injured. The line broke under Bandinel's weight and he in turn fell, but from a greater height onto the rocks below, where he was discovered unconscious by a guard in the morning; he died later that day, 11 February. He was buried on 13 February in St Martin's churchyard. Elizabeth Bandinel survived her husband; Jacques Bandinel escaped for a time, but was recaptured and died in prison.<br>
