<span class="headword">Hill,  George Alexander</span>  (1892&#150;1968), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born in Estonia, the son of a timber merchant whose business interests extended from Siberia to Persia. He was educated by French and German governesses and soon developed exceptional linguistic skills. He spoke six languages and his Russian was fluent. Hill was on a fishing trip to British Columbia when war broke out in 1914. He immediately joined a Canadian infantry regiment and was posted to Ypres in 1915. He showed exceptional daring and bravery and was seriously wounded. He was then sent to the War Office where he began his career as an intelligence officer.<br>
<br>Hill's first assignment was in Greece, where he flew agents behind enemy lines. In 1917 he was sent to Petrograd as a member of the Royal Flying Corps mission and arrived amid the confusion of the Bolshevik Revolution. According to Hill's own richly embroidered account of his mission he undertook the hazardous task of taking the Romanian crown jewels from the Kremlin to Iasi, helped Leon Trotsky organize a military intelligence service and the Red Air Force, ran guns to Ukrainian nationalists, and recruited a number of German agents for counter-intelligence work. When the British landed in Murmansk he was obliged to flee to Finland with the Cheka close on his heels.<br>
<br>Hill returned briefly to Russia and then worked for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in the Middle East for the next three years, but the service was short of funds and Hill was reduced to living with his wife in a caravan in Sussex. His only recompense was appointment as an MBE and DSO, and the satisfaction of being mentioned in dispatches on three occasions. There followed a series of precarious jobs: a stint with the Royal Dutch&#150;Shell Oil Company, manager of the Globe Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in London, and deputy general manager to the impresario C. B. Cochran. During this time he wrote two volumes of memoirs&#151;<span class="italic">Go Spy the Land</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">The Dreaded Hour</span> (1936) and two unpublished plays.<br>
<br>When war broke out Hill was recalled to the SIS with the rank of major and worked as an instructor in section D (destruction) at Brickendonbury Hall near Hertford. His pupils included Kim Philby, who was impressed by &#145;Jolly George&#146; Hill's knowledge of explosives and wryly remarked that he had actually put sand in axle boxes  (Philby, 8). In 1940 the school was taken over by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and restructured. Hill remained on the staff until 1941 when he was selected to head an SOE mission to Moscow codenamed Sam. Colonel Hill arrived in the Soviet capital in September in time for the signing of two agreements between SOE and NKVD (the Soviet security organization). The first was designed to co-ordinate sabotage and propaganda in occupied Europe and to desist from subversive activities in each other's spheres of influence. It was also agreed that they would help one another infiltrate agents into occupied Europe. The second agreement dealt with targets and priorities.<br>
<br>Little came of these agreements, as in the winter of 1941 all foreign missions were evacuated to Kuibyshev. Hill did much to enliven this dreary provincial town by mixing some ingenious vodka cocktails that were greatly appreciated. During this time he managed to persuade the British boffins to pass on some ingenious devices to the Soviet partisans and organized the infiltration of some Soviet agents into occupied Europe in operations codenamed Pickaxe. With characteristic chutzpah Hill claims also to have written a handbook on guerrilla warfare for Soviet partisans.<br>
<br>There were further &#145;Pickaxes&#146; in 1942 but they began to cause great concern in the Foreign Office, who were alarmed about Britain's allies finding out that they were dropping Soviet agents into their countries. This position was strongly seconded by C. SOE was appalled at the quality of some of the agents they were asked to transport and refused a number of them as totally unsuited to the task. There were only four successful drops in 1942 and Whitehall was getting very impatient with Sam. Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, complained that Hill did &#145;not know his onions&#146; and was wasting the taxpayers' money. Hill countered that the problems resulted from &#145;sand in axle box tactics&#146; in London and he was enthusiastically supported by the ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.<br>
<br>In 1943 there were only six successful &#145;Pickaxe&#146; missions and frustrations on both sides were mounting. In April 1944 Hill's opposite number, Colonel Chichayev, complained that SOE had done practically nothing and anyway the Soviets no longer had any need for them. SOE was frustrated by NKVD's refusal to co-operate in Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly with the Polish underground army. Hill can hardly be blamed for the failure of his mission. It was unrealistic to imagine that SOE and NKVD could ever co-operate successfully and this inevitably led to mutual accusations and recriminations.<br>
<br>Clark Kerr arrived in London in December 1944 and announced that there was little for Hill to do in Moscow. He was now a brigadier and it was felt that he could be replaced by a more junior officer. Hill returned to London in the summer of 1945. After the war he became a director of the British-owned German mineral water company Apollinarius. It was a strange finale for a man who was never known to have refused a drink. He died in 1968 shortly after his second marriage.<br>
