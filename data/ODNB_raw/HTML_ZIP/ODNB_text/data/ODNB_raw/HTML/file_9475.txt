<span class="headword">Finney,  Samuel</span>  (1719&#150;1798), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born at Wilmslow, Cheshire, in late January or early February 1719 and was baptized in Wilmslow, at the church of St Bartholomew, on 9 February 1719. He was the eldest son of Samuel Finney (<i>b</i>. 1696, <i>d</i>. after 1764), gentleman, of Fulshaw, Wilmslow, Cheshire, and Esther (1699&#150;1748), daughter of Ralph Davenport of Chorley, who had married at Fulshaw on 29 April 1718. In later life Finney wrote an autobiographical account and a history of his family in &#145;An historical survey of the parish of Wilmslow&#146;  (MS, Chester Archive). His collected letters, both by Finney and to him, including some from his father, who later emigrated to America, are included in the Finney of Fulshaw MSS (Ches. &amp; Chester ALSS).<br>
<br>Like most British miniaturists at this date Finney was self-taught and took up miniature painting only as an adult. He was educated at Chesterfield grammar school, after which he first trained as an attorney and was admitted in the court of the king's bench. However, a failed partnership left him without funds and disillusioned with the law. On a holiday with an uncle he took up drawing and attempted a portrait in &#145;Indian Ink&#146;, which &#145;acquired the applause of the beholders&#146;  (Finney, &#145;Autobiographical account&#146;, 267&#150;87). From this success he resolved to attempt portraiture as his profession.<br>
<br>Finney's &#145;Historical survey&#146; traces his efforts to learn his art by copying miniatures and to establish himself professionally in the years before public exhibitions offered an easy channel to an audience. He first visited Bath, a &#145;polite watering place&#146;, where he advertised his services in the <span class="italic">Bath Journal</span> of 25 April 1748. In the same year he moved back to London with his wife, Martha Foster (<i>d</i>. 1779), whom he had probably married in 1747. In his account he carefully notes his successes as well as the improvements in his earnings and in the couple's social standing. They frequently upgraded their lodgings and eventually took their own house in Leicester Fields as well as summer lodgings at Richmond, and added &#145;a Man Servant in livery to their Maid&#146;  (Finney, &#145;Autobiographical account&#146;, 287&#150;313).<br>
<br>Finney referred to himself as a gentleman, and his career was driven by his desire to acquire sufficient funds to reclaim family property, including Fulshaw Hall in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and to re-establish himself in his family's former sphere of influence. In 1769 his perception of the increased competition in miniature painting, the onset of gout, and a successful conclusion to his business arrangements at Fulshaw led to his retirement. Finney resided for nearly thirty years in Fulshaw and was appointed justice of the peace. In a letter of 1779 to Gabriel Mathias he commented that his &#145;Employment has been [these ten years] in the ruder works of Agriculture, which raise a very different set of Ideas in the mind than the practice of the polite Arts&#146;  (Finney, MS correspondence, DFF/34/3). He finally sold his artists' materials in 1777.<br>
<br>Finney's autobiographical writings and his letters provide a fascinating insight into miniature painting in the 1750s and 1760s. He notes fellow miniaturists Gervase Spencer and Jeremiah Meyer, admiring the former and disliking the latter, whom he called &#145;that rascal Miers&#146;  (Finney, &#145;Autobiographical account&#146;, 385&#150;411). Like them Finney worked in watercolour on ivory and in enamel. He took up enamel painting because he felt that other artists' interest in watercolour on ivory was increasing, leading to a threatening level of competition. Additionally he recognized that watercolour faded and that &#145;deceitful&#146; watercolour would not ensure his reputation in the future, as would enamels; certainly, despite his prolific output, few of his miniatures have survived or are recognized today as his work. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, has one miniature by him, a portrait of Queen Charlotte, which, as Finney predicted, has faded. It is none the less an elegant and accomplished work.<br>
<br>Finney claimed that he taught himself enamel painting, but it is possible that he received technical instruction in that complex art from his friend George Robertson, who was a jeweller. In 1763 he was appointed &#145;enamel and miniature painter to her majesty&#146;, for which he received a salary, in return for his regular attendance at court, and a pension on his retirement. Interestingly Finney noted that the court could find no previous record of an appointment as &#145;miniature painter&#146;; both court and artist clearly were unaware of the older term of limner.<br>
<br>Finney's writings also provide a first-hand record of the dramatic changes in the London art world in the 1760s. He exhibited miniatures at the second exhibition of the Society of Artists in 1761, and in 1765 he exhibited a miniature of Queen Charlotte. He was a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists. He was friends with a number of artists, such as Edward Penny and Thomas Hudson, and was also a member of the Turk's Head Society. He died at Fulshaw Hall in 1798 and was buried at Wilmslow. He was survived by his second wife, Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Barlow), whom he had married in 1793.<br>
