<span class="headword">Fagge <span class="st"> [Fagg]</span>, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1627&#150;1701), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 4 October 1627, the only son of John Fagge (<i>d</i>. 1645) of Rye and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Barnaby Hodgson. In 1644 he was (probably) admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and (certainly, in July) to Gray's Inn, although he did not graduate (r apparently matriculate), nor does he appear to have been called to the bar. Fagge's father was a successful merchant in Rye, and a prominent local puritan who served as the town's mayor, stood unsuccessfully for election to parliament in 1640, and supported the parliamentarians during the civil war. Following his father's death Fagge junior came under the political tutelage of his parliamentarian kinsmen, most obviously <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19287/', "Harbert Morley")</script>, who was emerging as a political Independent of growing importance. Morley was Fagge's guardian and on 19 March 1646 Fagge married Mary Morley (<i>d</i>. 1687), Harbert's sister, the daughter of Robert Morley of Glynde.<br>
<br>In many ways the interest in Fagge's career consists in how it reveals the existence and nature of clientage within the House of Commons, and Fagge's parliamentary career was nothing without Morley. It was Morley's influence which helped to ensure that Fagge was elected to parliament as recruiter MP for Rye in 1645, at the age of only eighteen. The aim was probably to prevent the return of a rival presbyterian candidate, and thereafter Fagge made little impact on the Commons, other than possibly as lobby fodder for Morley and his allies. It was undoubtedly Fagge's association with the increasingly prominent Morley which resulted in his nomination as a commissioner for the trial of Charles I in January 1649. Although he was present at some of the preparatory meetings, Fagge, like Morley, attended little of the trial, and refused to sign the king's death warrant. Similarly, association with Morley probably underlay Fagge's unsuccessful candidature for election to the council of state in November 1652, despite his having played little significant role in the Commons during the preceding years. Fagge probably opposed the dissolution of the Rump, and secured election to Cromwell's parliaments in 1654 and 1656 as an opponent of the protectorate. This was blatantly apparent to the regime, as was Fagge's dependence upon his patron. Major-General William Goffe claimed that Fagge would &#145;not stir a hair's breadth without Colonel Morley&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 4.161), and both men were excluded from parliament in 1656, although Fagge was subsequently allowed to take his seat.<br>
<br>During 1659, both as knight of the shire for Sussex in Richard Cromwell's parliament and as a member of the restored Rump (May&#150;October), Fagge emerged as a more prominent figure, and as an activist for the civilian republicans and the &#145;good old cause&#146;. When the army interrupted the sittings of the Rump, Fagge and Morley briefly flirted with the idea of suing for a pardon from Charles II and of working for his restoration. Once George Monck declared in favour of parliament, however, Fagge joined with Morley, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, and Valentine Walton in trying to secure Portsmouth for the Rump, and military support in Sussex. Although Fagge was briefly arrested, their cause was successful, and their efforts contributed to the recall of the Rump once again in December 1659. Fagge was subsequently named to the council of state, although he was prevented from taking his seat for refusing to take an oath abjuring the Stuart dynasty.<br>
<br>Although relatively inactive after the secluded members had been readmitted in February 1660, Fagge was elected to the Convention Parliament for Steyning in Sussex in the following April, indicated his support for Charles II, and secured both a pardon and a baronetcy upon the Restoration. Thereafter Fagge gained election to every parliament during the remainder of the century, almost exclusively representing Steyning. His continued influence at Rye, however, ensured that he was one of the townsmen selected to attend the king's coronation in April 1661, and to carry the royal canopy. Having greatly extended his estate during the 1650s, he remained a substantial gentry figure, whose seat at Wiston was one of the great estates in the region. His abiding friendship with Harbert Morley was evident from his nomination as executor of Morley's will and guardian of his young children.<br>
<br>For the remainder of his life Fagge was reckoned to be a whig sympathizer, but he never again assumed the political prominence he had achieved during the 1650s. However, he did become the focus in 1675 for a famous and acrimonious dispute concerning parliamentary privilege between the Commons and Lords. It was occasioned by a legal dispute over Fagge's estate, and resulted in his being briefly imprisoned in the Tower. The matter twice threatened parliamentary deadlock, and to prevent this sessions had to be prematurely curtailed. In later years he was considered an ally by the earl of Shaftesbury, and a supporter of the exclusion of James II, and the succession of the duke of Monmouth. He was certainly prepared to patronize religious nonconformists. Fagge's first wife, Mary, died on 20 November 1687. His second wife, Anne, daughter of Philip Weston of Newbury in Berkshire and widow of one Thomas Henshaw of Billingshurst in Sussex, lived until 11 May 1694. Fagge died on 18 January 1701 (and was buried the following day), and was succeeded by his son, Sir Robert Fagge, the eldest surviving son of John's and Mary's family of nine sons and five daughters.<br>
