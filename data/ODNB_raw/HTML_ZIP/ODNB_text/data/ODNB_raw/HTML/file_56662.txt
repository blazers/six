<span class="headword">Bach,  Edward</span>  (1886&#150;1936), <span class="occ">homoeopathic physician</span>, was born at The Hollies, Alcester Road, Moseley, Birmingham, on 24 September 1886, the son of Walter Best Bach, a brass-founder, and his wife, Ada Brenda Tipper. He was educated at Winterloe School, Moseley, Birmingham, but left aged sixteen and worked in the foundry for three years in order to collect the money to pay for his medical education. However, when his father realized that his ambition was serious, he agreed to give him a sufficient allowance for him to enter Birmingham University. In 1912 he qualified in medicine at University College Hospital, London, after which he served there as casualty house surgeon. He then took up a similar appointment at the National Temperance Hospital, but ill health prevented him from completing his term there. On 14 January 1913 he married Gwendoline (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of Eouery Caiger, a consulting engineer. After her death he married on 2 May 1917 Kitty Emmeline Jane (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), daughter of James Light, a company secretary.<br>
<br>Bach became disillusioned by the way that conventional medicine concentrated on the curing of symptoms, and he came to believe that effective treatment depended upon knowledge of the causes of disease. Therefore, having been found unfit for military service, he returned to University College Hospital in 1915 as assistant bacteriologist, to develop his interest in immunology. He became well known as a bacteriologist among the orthodox profession, working in the field of intestinal toxaemia. In 1919 he moved to the London Homoeopathic Hospital. Here he demonstrated the presence of non-lactose-fermenting bacilli in the stools of many patients. These were similar to the typhoid bacillus but non-pathogenic. However, Bach believed that they caused toxins which could be absorbed into the bloodstream and produce ill health. He admired C. F. S. Hahnemann, the founder of homoeopathy, whom he considered had realized that disease originated above the physical plane. Bach regarded his own work in the laboratory as a natural sequel to homoeopathy and believed that he had demonstrated the validity of Hahnemann's theory of chronic disease.<br>
<br>Together with Dr Charles Wheeler, a physician at the hospital, Bach prepared vaccines from the bacteria he had discovered, for treatment in accordance with the received wisdom of the time. In 1925 they published <span class="italic">Chronic Disease, a Working Hypothesis</span>, an account of their work in which they claimed remarkable successes in 500 cases that had received no treatment other than the vaccines. Wheeler was the first doctor to prepare homoeopathic remedies from the polyvalent vaccines, and Dr Dishington of Glasgow used these clinically. On hearing of this work in 1927, Bach set about preparing a new stock of polyvalent vaccines suitable for potentizing. He had the remedies prepared at considerable personal expense. These were some of the bowel nosodes which John Paterson, the then bacteriologist at the hospital, later showed could be associated with other homoeopathic remedies. But Bach was already seeking a better method of treatment.<br>
<br>Because the load of routine work interfered with his research, Bach had left the London Homoeopathic Hospital in 1922. He continued his highly successful Harley Street practice and also treated the poor free of charge. In 1928 he is said to have realized at a dinner party that personalities could be classified into several distinct types, and he concluded that reactions to disease would also differ. That autumn he went to Wales and brought back two plants, <i>Mimulus</i> and <i>Impatiens</i>, from which he prepared remedies by a similar method to that used for the vaccines. He later added <i>Clematis</i> to his medicines. In 1930 he gave up his practice. He made another journey to Wales in search of more herbs. When walking through a dew-laden field he decided that a dewdrop, when warmed by the sun, could absorb the remedial properties of a plant. This led to his method of preparing remedies using only pure water. That year he wrote <span class="italic">Heal Thyself</span>, which was published in 1931 and has remained in print ever since. In it he summarized his theory that disease was due to soul and personality being in conflict.<br>
<br>From 1930 to 1934 Bach lived in Cromer, Norfolk, seeking and preparing further remedies with which he treated patients successfully. He did not charge for this treatment and his financial resources dwindled. He therefore moved to Mount Vernon, a small house in Oxfordshire. Here he wrote, lectured, sought further remedies, and trained assistants to carry on his work. His advertising, and use of medically unqualified assistants, brought him into conflict with the General Medical Council. He received two warnings, though formal proceedings were never instituted. Having produced thirty-seven flower remedies, and a mixture known as &#145;Rescue remedy&#146;, he was satisfied that his work was complete. He now had medicines available to treat all the negative factors that he believed caused disease.<br>
<br>Bach appears to have been a healer in the true sense and is reputed to have healed patients simply by touch. He had an intense unselfish desire to help others. He was a gentle man, an idealist yet practical. His tastes were simple; he loved the country, gardening, and carpentry. Nobody who knew him failed to admire him, however strongly they might disagree with his theories. Bach died as a result of cardiac failure and sarcoma on 27 November 1936 in the Ladygrave Nursing Home, Manor Road, Didcot, and was buried in St James's churchyard, Sotwell, Oxfordshire. The Edward Bach Centre was established at Mount Vernon in recognition of his work.<br>
