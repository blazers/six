<span class="headword">Primrose,  James</span>  (1600&#150;1659), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the eldest of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22796/', "Gilbert Primrose (1566/7&#150;1642)")</script>, a Scottish minister in the French Reformed church, and his wife, Elizabeth Brenin (<i>c</i>.1567&#150;1637), was born at Mirambeau, Saintonge. Much of his youth was spent in Bordeaux, to whose Reformed church his father had been called in 1603. He attended the University of Bordeaux and graduated there MA. After a period of medical study in Paris he matriculated at the University of Montpellier in 1615 and in short order gained an MB, a medical licence, and in 1617 an MD. At least part of his studies were paid for by James I of England.<br>
<br>The Primroses had a strong connection to the house of Stuart. Primrose's grandfather was Gilbert Primrose, principal surgeon to James VI and I and his wife, Queen Anne. On the surgeon's death in 1615, his place was taken by Duncan Primrose, probably his son. In 1623 James Primrose's father was forced to leave France and took a position as minister of the French Reformed church in London. He continued in that position until his death in 1641. Gilbert Primrose was made a royal chaplain and in 1625, on the king's personal recommendation, he was created a DD by the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>James Primrose incorporated on his Montpellier MD at Oxford in 1628, doubtlessly as a prelude to applying for a medical licence from the London College of Physicians. On 9 December 1629 he was successfully examined for the licence at the home of the college president, John Argent. On 11, 12, and 14 December Primrose attended the lectures of Helkiah Crooke on morbid anatomy, held in the college house. Much of the discussion among the fellows centred on William Harvey's book on the circulation of the blood, which had been published only recently. Primrose became concerned over the lack of criticism of the new theory and subsequently was able to gain the support of Charles I, a family patron and ally, for delivering a series of public medical lectures in London. The college was aghast that a new licentiate, and not even a fellow of their company, should be allowed the right of any public lectures. The matter was dropped, but Primrose, in a very short time, according to his later reckoning, published in London in 1630 the first serious rebuttal of Harvey's discovery: <span class="italic">Exercitationes et animadversiones in librum Gulielmi Harvaei de motu cordis et circulatione sanguinis</span>. Primrose's stay in the capital was a brief one. He first appeared before the college in 1629; was listed among foreign doctors in the City in 1632; but was not named among licentiates living in London in 1635.<br>
<br>In his appearance before the college, Primrose stated among his qualifications that he had studied medicine with Professor Jean Riolan at the University of Paris. This may have occurred just after his Montpellier MD of 1617, but much of the time from that date was spent in actual medical practice, probably in Yorkshire, and possibly in Hull, where he was to spend a large part of his medical life. In one of his last books before his death in 1659 he mentioned having seen a case of rickets, before the illness even had a name, in Yorkshire in 1628. The ten years of medical practice, to which he referred in his book against Harvey, were likely therefore to have been spent in England not France. His return to Hull by no later than 1634 has better documentation, for he was charged with being a Roman Catholic recusant there in 1637 and 1640. He returned briefly to London again in the latter year to marry Louise (Lucie) de Haukmont (<i>d</i>. 1653) at his father's Reformed church. They had several children. The marriages of Roman Catholics in protestant churches for legal reasons was not unknown. Primrose's religion is not easy to tease from his many books, but there are indications in them that he remained a Roman Catholic after the charges of 1637 and 1640.<br>
<br>In 1638 Primrose had published in London what would turn out to be his most popular book: <span class="italic">De vulgi in medicina erroribus</span>. The book was a systematic attack on the non-professional practice of medicine, folk medicine, quackery, and malpractice. In 1640 a young physician from Hull, Robert Wittie, published an English version of a separate work by Primrose on part of the same subject, <span class="italic">The Antimonial Cup Twice Cast</span>. It was the beginning of a long and fruitful friendship and professional partnership. Though Wittie was strongly Presbyterian in religious sympathies and a Harveian on the circulation of the blood, a fierce dedication to the medical profession, shared by Primrose, made possible an unlikely alliance. In 1651 Wittie published his translation of a revised edition of Primrose's <span class="italic">De vulgi</span>: <span class="italic">Popular Errours, or, The Errours of the People in Physick</span>. Some of the common errors refuted by Primrose were that the linen of the sick ought not to be changed; that remedies ought not to be rejected for their unpleasantness; and that gold boiled in broth will cure consumption, to name but a few. The book featured some dedicatory poetry by another Hull resident and native, Andrew Marvell. Primrose remarried in 1653 and with his second wife, Elizabeth, had two children: James, baptized in 1654, and Maria, baptized at Holy Trinity, Hull, in 1656.<br>
<br>Despite writing many books on many medical topics, Primrose is best known as the orthodox Galenic opponent of Harvey's discovery of the circulation. Using some contemporary anatomists as well, including Vesalius, Primrose questioned the truth of any doctrine based on vivisection, which was an unnatural intrusion into the ordinary functioning of the body that could yield only unnatural conclusions. Such discoveries had absolutely no utility to the actual practice of medicine, an art that was best learned from the well-established authority of Hippocrates and Galen, and traditional commentators. More than that, these discoveries threatened to undermine fundamental therapeutic techniques like phlebotomy, based on ancient physiology and which would be rendered nonsensical if the blood actually circulated through the body as Harvey maintained. Primrose did allow that in systole, or contraction, some blood left the heart, but this was not the heart's primary function which was rather as a receptacle for the heating of the blood. Primrose was by no means a slave to books and his own medical practice was tempered by experience, which he thought essential for a doctor. He was suspicious of academic medicine because it inevitably produced useless novelties, like that of the circulation, but he was very capable of independent thought which led him to accept in his last years the lesser or pulmonary circulation. He was also open to the benefits of chemical medicine, while his work throughout showed him flexible in modifying his traditional method with original thought and observation.<br>
<br>Primrose was a prolific and highly regarded medical author, enjoying a wide European audience and numerous reprints of his many books. In addition to the <span class="italic">Exercitationes</span> of 1630, he wrote at least four other books against Harveian professors of medicine: one against Walaeus of Leiden in 1639; two against Regius of Utrecht in 1640; and a fourth against the converted Harveian, Plempius of Louvain, in 1657. Like his idol Galen, there was scarcely a field of medicine on which he did not write. These included two handbooks on the main principles and practice of medicine, <span class="italic">Aphorismi necessarii ad doctrinam medicinae acquirendam perutiles</span>, published at Leiden in 1647, and <span class="italic">Enchiridion medicum</span>, at Amsterdam in 1650; another on pharmacy and the compounding of medicines, <span class="italic">Ars pharmaceutica</span>, appeared in Amsterdam in 1651. Three of his later books were published at Rotterdam: one on gynaecology, <span class="italic">De mulierum morbis</span> (1655); a second on fevers, <span class="italic">De febribus</span> (1658); and his final book, on childhood illnesses, <span class="italic">Partes duae de morbis puerorum</span>, which was published in the year of his death, 1659. The last was still much respected by British physicians in the late eighteenth century. Primrose was also the author of a short Latin history of Montpellier, <span class="italic">Academia Monspelienses descripta</span>, published at Oxford in 1631 and dedicated to the regius professor of physic, Thomas Clayton. Primrose died in Hull in December 1659 and was buried in the parish church of the Holy Trinity, a parish in which he had lived and worked for most of his medical life. He was buried near his first wife. At least six of their children had been baptized in the church between 1642 and 1651. Primrose left his surviving sons under the guardianship of Robert Wittie, who is known to have seen Caesar and Isaac, the sons of Primrose and his first wife, through Cambridge. Primrose's widow married John Smithson, vicar of Paghill on 18 January 1664.<br>
