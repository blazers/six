<span class="headword">Stiff,  George</span>  (1807&#150;1874), <span class="occ">engraver and newspaper proprietor</span>, of obscure origins, was considered by <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> at his death to have been &#145;one of the principal pioneers of illustrated literature in its present form&#146;. However, he was an obsessively secretive figure, constantly covering his tracks to avoid his creditors, and very little is known of his personal life. He first appears in London between 1844 and 1845, directing the engraving department of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, a journal which had inaugurated the illustrated newspapers in the Victorian period. In 1847 Stiff became proprietor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Times</span>, and from 1848 to 1862 carried on a publishing business from an office in 334 Strand. On 1 March 1845, spurred by the success of the twopenny magazine the <span class="italic">Family Herald</span> (1843&#150;60), which had no pictures, he had started the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> (1845&#150;1912) at a penny for thirty-two pages. This featured often lurid woodcuts, and became the pioneer of a flood of popular illustrated journals. By the third volume it reported, with back numbers, a sale of 120,000. In 1852, aided by the success of J. F. Smith's serial &#145;Minnigrey&#146;, its sales reached an unprecedented half million.<br>
<br>Stiff claimed to supervise &#145;the literary department&#146; with &#145;active zeal&#146;, and deserves much of the credit for the <span class="italic">Journal</span>'s successful design. His editors and writers included several of the most popular sensation novelists of their time, including G. W. M. Reynolds, John Frederick Smith (whom Stiff launched on his career), Percy B. St John, Harrison Ainsworth, Charles Reade, and Mrs E. D. E. N. Southworth. The <span class="italic">Journal</span>'s woodcuts, occasionally engraved and signed by Stiff himself, featured for some years the work of John Gilbert, besides that of Hablot K. Browne and John Proctor.<br>
<br>Starting as a publisher without capital Stiff financed his projects by incurring such heavy debts that the paper makers, his main creditors, were obliged to continue to support him to avoid total loss. Although it has been claimed that he was earning some &pound;10,000 a year, in 1857 he sold the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> for a sum variously given, but in the region of &pound;30,000, in order to pay off his creditors, and apparently repurchased the title for a similar sum. Later, on 20 March 1862, he filed a petition against bankruptcy with debts of &pound;52,250. He was eventually discharged on 3 December 1862, when the commissioner noted that his personal expenditure in the period prior to bankruptcy had been &#145;enormous&#146;, and related proceedings dragged on for another eighteen months. But Stiff remained an inveterate speculator. From 1860 to 1861 he held the copyright to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and was joint proprietor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span> from 1869 to his death. In 1864 he attempted to emulate his earlier success with the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> by publishing the <span class="italic">London Reader</span>, identical in style and employing some of the same writing talents, including J. F. Smith and Mrs Southworth. The periodical was to survive to 1903. Stiff, however, died intestate, impecunious, and without known family on 14 November 1874, aged sixty-seven, of heart disease and bronchitis, while visiting Worcester Park, Cuddington, near Epsom. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
