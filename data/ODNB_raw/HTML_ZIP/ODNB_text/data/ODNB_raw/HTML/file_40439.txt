<span class="headword">Robins,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1641&#150;1652), <span class="occ">subject of deification</span>, may have come from Wells, Somerset. The Baptist preacher Thomas Collier coupled his name with that of <a name="cosubject_40439"></a><span class="headword">Joshua Garment</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1631&#150;1660)<span class="occ"></span> writing that in &#145;Wells was the seat of the old Ranters, Garment and Robins, who was proclaimed the great God, came to a shameful end&#146;  (Collier, 16). In his youth it is possible that Robins may have been influenced by the doctrines of the Somerset minister John Traske. Traske's teaching emphasized the applicability of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> laws to Christians. He and his followers kept the dietary laws of the Jews and observed the sabbath on Saturday. It is therefore suggestive that in 1627 John Robins, joiner of St Martins Le Organ, London, and father of a John Robins, bequeathed money to Traske as well as to Meredith Madey, a Calvinist preacher whose troublesome and vexatious behaviour had resulted in his deprivation from the rectory of Blagdon, Somerset.<br>
<br>John Robins was to be variously described as a &#145;Shoomaker&#146;, &#145;Glazier&#146; or husbandman (<span class="italic">Faithful Scout</span>, 23&#150;30 May 1651, 171; W. Birchley [J. Austin], <span class="italic">The Christian Moderator</span>, 1651, 21). No one by that name, however, was admitted as a freeman of the Cordwainers' Company between the years 1636 and 1648. Nor was anyone by that name listed as a freeman of the Glaziers' Company in their contribution to the poll tax of 1641. John Robins was probably married, most likely to a woman called Joan. In October 1640 a Joan Robins, wife of John Robins of Southwark, was questioned by the court of high commission, though the reason why remains unclear.<br>
<br>John Robins took the protestation oath in July 1641 in the parish of St Margaret's, Edgware, signing his name John Robbards. Likewise, in March 1642 Joshua Garment took the protestation oath in the parish of St Cuthbert's, Wells, signing himself Josuah Garment. By his own account, Garment served as a parliamentarian soldier for three years in the civil war. On leaving the army Garment had a vision of an angel offering him bread. In his vision Garment ate this sacramental food, perhaps to symbolize his new covenant with God. Garment was also addressed by the prophetic name &#145;Josherbah&#146; and told that &#145;the time draws near that the Jews, even the Hebrews must be gathered and delivered&#146;. This was the second of Garment's supposed visions, for he was also to claim that in 1631 he foresaw the abolition of episcopacy and monarchy  (Garment, 3&#150;4). It may have been about this time&#151;if later reports of her confession are to be believed&#151;that Joan Robins came &#145;by the Word of the Lord&#146; to live with Garment as his wife  (<span class="italic">The Ranters Creed</span>, 1651, 2). She was said to have stayed with him three years. Though accounted a poor man, Garment was much talked of. A former parliamentarian army chaplain, Robert Bacon, had heard Hugh Peters &#145;particularly&#146; speak of him, and Bacon himself visited Garment at his house  (Bacon, 41). On 10 July 1650 Joan Robins, subsequently described as the wife of John Robins of Edgware, was indicted on the charge of witchcraft at the Old Bailey. It is possible that the root of the accusation lay in the public uttering of curses, interpreted as incantations, rather than in the actual practice of witchcraft. She was found not guilty. Some time in early November she appears to have become pregnant by John Robins.<br>
<br>In late August 1650 it was reported that six people had gone forth from Somerset, four from Glastonbury and two from Wells. It was said that they pretended to have &#145;an immediate call from God to goe and preach the Gospel in Gallilee&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall</span>, 26 Aug &#150; 2 Sept 1650, 472). They had sold their estates and were bound for London. It may have been this group of some &#145;half a dozen&#146; men and women that Robert Bacon recounted meeting on the road near Marlborough. Bacon related that they told him that in effect &#145;they were Jews, and that the time of their gathering together out of all Lands&#146;, especially England, was at hand  (Bacon, 41). They intended to go to Jerusalem&#151;circumcised. In March 1651 letters were received from Somerset carrying news of some who &#145;pretend themselves to be Prophets&#146;. It was said that these prophets preached and prayed at Wells, Glastonbury, and Tunbridge. One claimed that he and &#145;his fellow Prophets&#146; would shortly &#145;walk over the River of Thames&#146; at high tide (<span class="italic">Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 18&#150;25 March 1651, 102&#150;3; <span class="italic">Faithful Scout</span>, 21&#150;28 March 1651, 108). By this time, it seems, John Robins and Joshua Garment had become acquainted. According to Garment a vision came to him in 1650 of John Robins:<blockquote>Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, this is thy Lord, Israels King, Judge, and Law giver &hellip; This is the Melchizedek that Abraham met in the way, even the Adam that was the first created man, who is restored, set and sent by God his Creator &hellip; to gather and deliver the Hebrews &hellip; This is he that shall &hellip; divide the Seas, and lead the Hebrews to their own Land, even as Moses did out of Egypt &hellip; Deliverance will be this year &hellip; The manchild will be born this year, even he that shall come and rule with a rod of iron all Nations &hellip; The sea shall be divided, and many Jews that [are here] in England shall go thorow on dry foot towards Judea and the Lord said, I will gather all the Jews in the world unto one place, and with signs and wonders in great power bring them thorow all countries, bring in the ten Tribes unto us &hellip; John Robins is the man ordained by the Creator of heaven and earth to lead the Hebrews. (Garment, 3&#150;5)</blockquote>Lodowick Muggleton provided some additional and belated details to the story:<blockquote>John Robins was to gather out of Engla[n]d and else where, an Hundred and Forty Four Thousand Men and Women, and lead them to Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there to make them happy: And that he would feed them with Manna from Heaven: And that he would divide the Red Sea, and that they should go through upon dry Land. (Muggleton, 21)</blockquote>In these relations of Robins there is a discernible millenarian scheme: a divinely ordained mission to &#145;gather and deliver the Hebrews&#146;; a prophetic calling to lead the Ten Tribes of Israel out of captivity and return with them unto &#145;their own Land&#146;; the metaphor of the Jews as God's chosen people; the prophecy taken from the revelation of the &#145;Hundred and Forty Four Thousand&#146; of all the tribes of the children of Israel; the Mount of Olives overlooking the temple at Jerusalem; and the assumption of the threefold offices of Christ, that is king, priest, and prophet. Moreover, Garment regarded Robins as that &#145;great Type of Christ&#146;, Melchisedek, who was &#145;made like unto the Son of God&#146; and of whose priestly order Christ was &#145;for ever after&#146; &#145;an high priest&#146; (J. Gauden, <span class="italic">The Case of Ministers Maintenance by Tithes</span>, 1653, 12; cf. <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 7: 3, 5: 6, 10). This was attested to by Robert Bacon who encountered Garment and Robins at a wealthy merchant's house in London. Bacon remembered how Robins spoke in tongues and<blockquote>mentioned oft Melchisedeck, the High Priest, or Priest-hood, the name Judah, and Jesus, with such zeal, that the fire seemed to me, even to sparkle out of his eyes: he did besides &hellip; curse with great bitterness the Priest-hood &hellip; that was not after the order of Melchisedeck. (Bacon, 41&#150;2)</blockquote>The priesthood that &#145;was not after the order of Melchisedeck&#146; was the priesthood of the circumcised, the priesthood of Aaron. And the self-appointed high priest of Aaron's order was TheaurauJohn Tany, a self-proclaimed prophet who, in the minds of some, was to become linked to John Robins's millenarian schemes.<br>
<br>On Monday 12 May 1651, two men and five women were apprehended in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. They were brought before Laurence Whitaker, justice of the peace for Middlesex. On examination it was found that they believed John Robins to be &#145;the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#146; and Joan Robins to be pregnant with &#145;the Saviour of all that shall be saved in this world&#146;. They also affirmed that John Robins had &#145;power to raise the dead&#146; (E. H., 3&#150;4; Taylor, 2). The occupations of the men were given as glazier and wire drawer. None of the women had a husband and most could not sign their name. They were taken prisoner to the Gatehouse, Westminster. All save one recanted, and were released on bail on 20 June 1651. The obdurate disciple, Thomas Kerby, was convicted of blasphemy and served three months of his six-month sentence. According to some reports, on Sunday 18 May 1651, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, John Robins, Joshua Garment, Joan Robins, and several others were apprehended at Shoreditch. Robins was supposed to be a &#145;Witch&#146; and his followers accounted &#145;Ranters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Passages of Every Daies Intelligence</span>, 23&#150;30 May 1651, 318). On 24 May they were examined before Thomas Hubbert, justice of the peace for Middlesex, and committed to the New Prison at Clerkenwell on the charge of blasphemy. While imprisoned Garment wrote <span class="italic">The Hebrews Deliverance at Hand</span>; its publication perhaps paid for by the London merchant that had formerly entertained him. His case was brought to the attention of the House of Commons, who referred it for examination to the committee for plundered ministers. At the same time it appears that Robins began to receive an assortment of curious visitors, come to &#145;dispute and converse&#146; with him  (G. H., 3). Among them was John Reeve, who later claimed to be greatly disturbed by an apparition of Robins's face staring at him while he lay in his bed. It seems that some of Robins's former followers became known to Reeve and Muggleton. Perhaps the connection was one of kinship. Moreover, three of Robins's female disciples came from Bocking or Braintree, in Essex&#151;an area later inhabited by several Muggletonians. Indeed, it may have been with the intention of founding his own sect on the remnants of Robins's group that Reeve, too, claimed to have received his own divine commission three days on end in February 1652. On 4 February 1652 Reeve and Muggleton confronted TheaurauJohn Tany, or so they were to claim. On 5 February 1652, Reeve and Muggleton visited John Robins in gaol. Reeve declared Robins to be &#145;that last great Antichrist, or man of sin&#146; spoken of &#145;in the <span class="roman">Thessalonians</span>&#146; and pronounced him &#145;cursed in soul and body&#146;&#151;a trick he may have learned from Robins  (Reeve, <span class="italic">Spiritual Treatise</span>, 6, 10). In time Reeve and Muggleton came to see scriptural knowledge and &#145;spiritual witchcraft&#146; as the source of Robins's great power, identifying his doctrines as a definitive &#145;influence&#146; in the formation of Quaker thought  (J. Reeve and L. Muggleton, <span class="italic">A True Interpretation of the Eleventh Chapter of the Revelation of St. John</span>, 1662, 158). Two months after receiving his sentence of damnation John Robins wrote a letter of recantation to Oliver Cromwell. He was released from prison, &#145;gave all his disciples about London the slip&#146;, and returned &#145;into his own Country&#146;. There he repurchased his land with the money of his former followers&#151;or so Reeve and Muggleton were to claim (Reeve, <span class="italic">Spiritual Treatise</span>, 10; Muggleton, 47). Though the truth of this story remains questionable, nothing more is known of John Robins. Joshua Garment, however, informed against Thomas Collier shortly after the Restoration, identifying Collier as the author of a petition demanding &#145;that justice should bee executed&#146; upon Charles I for hindering the Lord's work.<br>
