<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Otolorin,  John Adetayo</span>  (<em>c.</em>1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">landlord, theatrical agent, and community leader</span>, was born in Ilesha, Nigeria. His parents were Yoruba. He left Nigeria in 1919 as a seaman, came to Britain, and settled in Cardiff, where he worked as a motor mechanic and labourer while going to sea intermittently. He formed a relationship with a woman named Ada and found work as a film extra while establishing connections with the London film industry. Based in Wales, he became an important source for recruiting people of colour for films with an African background, a popular theme in the 1930s. In Cardiff and Newport he found extras for films including <span class="italic">Sanders of the River</span> (1935), Paul Robeson's first screen appearance in Britain; the film was criticized (among others by Robeson himself, who felt he was misled) for reinforcing racial stereotypes, but Otolorin's bonus was a named role as one of Robeson's chiefs, filmed wearing a feathered headdress and necklace of leopard's teeth. He travelled from Cardiff to the film set, where he acted alongside Jomo Kenyatta, future president of Kenya, and this connection, and his acquaintance with Robeson, were among his oft repeated claims to fame. He supplied extras for, and acted in, other films, working eventually as an agent in his own right.<br>
<br>An impressive figure standing 6 feet tall, with a long tribal scar on one cheek, Otolorin exploited his &#145;fierce&#146; appearance to provide protection for others less robust. One such was Macfold Howard, a cook with whom he, and other Nigerians, opened a Soho nightclub when Otolorin moved to London (while retaining a base in Cardiff) at the end of the 1930s. The venture was short-lived but Otolorin later helped finance Howard to open a caf&eacute; in Stepney, and remained available to help fight his friend's battles. He is believed to have been the father of a son, Francis, born in Stepney during this period. He acquired a house in Arlington Road in Camden Town, north London, where other west Africans had settled in the inter-war years. He let rooms, assisted in this enterprise by Elsie (1911&#150;2003), from Sheffield, the daughter of Frank Kay, stonemason, who lived with him there after he finally left Cardiff at the start of the Second World War. He served in the merchant navy (1940&#150;43), graduating from fireman to donkeyman before his ship was torpedoed. Rescued with only a handful of survivors, he was hospitalized on his return to England. With the war freeing up housing stock once beyond the reach of poor landlords, he rented additional properties. He purchased leaseholds, too, thereby providing homes for students, seamen, and <i>arrivants</i> from Africa and the Caribbean. His business expanded after the war and by 1955 he had seven houses, several flats, and shop facilities at his disposal.<br>
<br>With Elsie as his housekeeper, Otolorin cooked and kept open house. He ensured that the pot was always on the stove, and when students, musicians, and gamblers came to eat at his fireside they engaged in debate with politicians and activists including Chief Obafemi Awolowo, leader of the Nigerian Yorubas, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's future president, and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the first prime minister of independent Nigeria. To the guitarist Ambrose Campbell he was Pa Oto, &#145;the daddy of us all&#146;, his house &#145;like a restaurant with no pay&#146;  (private information, A. Campbell). American visitors included the singer Nat &#145;King&#146; Cole, who met the Nigerian traditional ruler the oni of Ife&#151;a jazz enthusiast&#151;and drank champagne with his <i>fufu</i> and pepper soup.<br>
<br>Otolorin was a familiar sight in Camden Town, never seen without his trademark black Homburg hat. His day began with a beer as soon as the pubs opened, and whenever he spotted friends&#151;African, West Indian, or Irish&#151;they would be invited for a drink. He enjoyed his pleasures but was generous with his surplus, too, and worked long shifts as a boilerman at the Ministry of Works in order to keep all comers fed. He continued finding film opportunities for himself and others in the post-war period and, in collaboration with the Nigerian drummer Samadu Jackson and the Sierra Leonean Charles Alleney, organized drum-and-dance troupes for broadcasts, stage shows, and the circus.<br>
<br>In 1951 Otolorin travelled to Nigeria to see his aged mother. He was f&ecirc;ted by those he had helped in their student days, among them Nnamdi Azikiwe, later governor-general and then president of Nigeria, and received two honorary chieftaincies from the oba of Lagos. In 1952 he was installed as an officer in the London chapter of the Oshugbo Iwashe (the Ijebu name for the Ogboni, a prominent Nigerian fraternal society). With his long involvement in informal social work, it was a logical step to join a body offering mutual support to its members. Proud of his status&#151;his Oshugbo title was Oluwo Chief J. A. Otolorin&#151;he celebrated his chieftaincies by wearing a gold crown on his watch-chain.<br>
<br>Otolorin was an important facilitator who helped build London's Nigerian community. He created social cohesion among Nigerians and others during inhospitable times by providing food, warmth, and reminders of &#145;home&#146;, and took responsibility for the funerals of some who died penniless. To Ose Davies he was &#145;a legend in his own way. A lot of Nigerian political life, social life, revolved around Oto in Arlington Road. He knew all those leaders &hellip; he entertained them all&#146;  (private information, O. Davies). In 1991 he was celebrated by Yemi Ajibade, who based the character of Pa Different on Otolorin in his play <span class="italic">A Long Way from Home</span>. He died at 11 Lyndhurst Gardens, West Hampstead, London, on 3 July 1963, from malignant cachexia and carcinoma of the oesophagus. His funeral, on 12 July, at St Matthew's Church, Oakley Square, London, was an impressive affair, conducted by the rural dean of St Pancras, with a motorcade accompanied by a police escort, and guests including the prime minister to the oba of Lagos. He was buried at Fulham cemetery, Lower Richmond Road, North Sheen. He was survived by his partner Elsie; his presumed son, Francis, predeceased him.<br>
