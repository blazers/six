<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baillie,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1725&#150;1802), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, probably from Dublin, entered the navy about 1740, and became a lieutenant on 29 March 1745, in which rank he served in the <i>Mars</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Scorpion</i>, <i>Culloden</i>, and, from 3 June 1752, the <i>Deptford</i> (50 guns), in which he was present at Byng's action near Minorca on 20 May 1756. He was subsequently one of the witnesses at Byng's trial.<br>
<br>Baillie was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Alderney</i> on 10 November 1756, but soon joined the frigate <i>Tartar</i> (28 guns) as first lieutenant. With her captain, John Lockhart, ashore recovering from illness or wounds, Baillie took the <i>Tartar</i> out on a cruise, and captured a French privateer of 24 guns and 240 men, the <i>Victoire</i> of Le Havre, or possibly the <i>St Marie</i>; this ship was purchased into the service as the <i>Tartar's Prize</i>, and the command of her, with post rank, was given to Captain Baillie on 30 March 1757.<br>
<br>Having used his Dublin connections to recruit seamen for the <i>Tartar's Prize</i>, Baillie was present at the action off Lagos on 18 and 19 August 1759 under Admiral Boscawen. His days of command at sea, however, came to an end the following year when the <i>Tartar's Prize</i> &#145;sprang a plank&#146; and was lost in the Mediterranean. In January 1761 he was appointed a captain of Greenwich Hospital, through the interest of the earl of Bute; in 1774 he became lieutenant-governor of the hospital.<br>
<br>In March 1778 Baillie published <span class="italic">The Case of the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich</span>, which sought to expose &#145;the several abuses that have been introduced into that great national establishment&#146;. Baillie listed in his catalogue of errors the appointment of non-naval men to offices, profligate expenditure on official apartments, poor treatment of pensioners resident at the hospital, and the reappointment of fraudulent contractors.<br>
<br>These charges were not calculated to endear Baillie&#151;who was basically an honest man&#151;to his colleagues or to promote his career, and they resulted in his dismissal, and a libel action brought against him by &#145;the inferior officers&#146; at Greenwich in November 1778. Magnificently defended by Thomas Erskine (who was later to become lord chancellor), Baillie won the case, but he was not reinstated, and a motion in the House of Lords to set up an inquiry into the management of Greenwich Hospital was defeated.<br>
<br>Sandwich, the first lord of the Admiralty, now seems less culpable in this affair than was once thought, and indeed had sided with Baillie against his colleagues in an earlier episode in 1771. But while he publicly declared that he knew nothing against Baillie's character as a naval officer, and also that he did not feel disposed to act vindictively against him, Sandwich was well aware that Baillie had exposed the way in which he had put his own Huntingdonshire voters into Greenwich Hospital in preference to seamen; and so, as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the earl of Bute, the public-spirited captain found himself aligned with Sandwich's enemies. Baillie's persistent applications to be reinstated at Greenwich or to be given a command at sea therefore proved fruitless, and he was left unemployed until, on the change of administration in 1782, the duke of Richmond, who became master-general of the Ordnance (and who had attempted to put Baillie's case in the Lords), appointed him to the lucrative office of clerk of the deliveries.<br>
<br>Baillie's fortunes further revived two years later, when he received a legacy of &pound;500 from John Barnard, the son of a former lord mayor of London, who left him this money &#145;as a small token of my approbation of his worthy and disinterested, though ineffectual, endeavours to rescue that noble national charity [Greenwich Hospital] from the rapacious hands of the basest and most wicked of mankind&#146;  (Charnock, 6.215n). Baillie's old age was spent in the quiet enjoyment of his office under the Ordnance, which he held until his death on 15 December 1802.<br>
