<span class="headword">Oxley,  Joseph</span>  (1715&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, the eldest son of John Oxley (1682/3&#150;1724), corn factor, and Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peckover (1685/6&#150;1720) of Fakenham, Norfolk, was born at Brigg in Lincolnshire on 4 November 1715. His mother, who was a Quaker minister, died in 1720, aged thirty-four; four years later, in January 1724, his father died, and thereafter he was raised by his Quaker uncle Edmund Peckover. After five years at Gilbert Thompson's school at Sankey in Lancashire he was apprenticed to Robert Henderson, a Quaker clockmaker, at Scarborough. It has been suggested that as a youth Oxley was &#145;led away by the influence of evil associates to an indifference towards religion, a neglect to attend meetings for worship and other unprofitable and disorderly practices. He became a source of great trouble to his relations and friends&#146;  (&#145;Oxley, Joseph&#146;, <span class="roman">Dictionary of Quaker biography</span>). In 1738, aged twenty-three, he moved to London to find employment. Soon afterwards he attended a large meeting on Kennington Common, held by the Calvinistic Methodist George Whitefield, and on account of his small stature was almost crushed to death. A gentlewoman who witnessed his predicament helped rescue him from danger, and this event led to his conversion to Quakerism. In 1742 he became a minister of the Society of Friends and travelled on missionary visits to Scotland, Ireland, and all parts of England.<br>
<br>In 1741 Oxley moved to Fakenham in Norfolk and opened a shop. On 28 June 1744 he married Elizabeth Fenn (1719?&#150;1753), a Quaker from Norwich, and formed a partnership in a prosperous woollen mill. On 22 March 1745 Ann, the first of his five children, was born; his wife died in 1753, when his children were still in their infancy. On 5 January 1757, at Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, Oxley married Mary Burr (1716&#150;1794), a Quaker minister originally from Royston in Hertfordshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1762 Oxley conducted a missionary visit to Friends in Cork, where on 15 July it was recorded that he was &#145;a sound Minister, a worthy Friend and a most agreeable companion&#146;  (&#145;Travelling in Ireland&#146;, 261). In July 1770 he sailed for America, and in September arrived at New York and proceeded to visit many Quaker meetings. At the yearly meeting in Philadelphia later that month Oxley recorded that it was a solemn meeting &#145;such as he had not seen before; so consistent in appearance of dress and uniformity throughout, agreeably to our holy profession&#146;  (Janney, 3.392). His letters and details of his life were later published by John Barclay under the title <span class="italic">Joseph's offering to his children: being Joseph Oxley's journal of his life, travels, and labours of love in the faith and fellowship of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1837) and provide interesting information about the colonies of Virginia, Maryland, and New England.<br>
<br>Oxley returned to Norwich in April 1772, having travelled 13,755 miles, and died there suddenly on 22 October 1775; he was interred in the Quaker burial-ground at Norwich four days later. On 26 April 1776 Norwich Friends composed the following testimony:<blockquote>This our dear Friend was exemplary in conduct and agreeable in conversation, honest in advice, charitable in sentiment, and unwearied in Benevolence. He was therefore deservedly esteemed by his neighbours and beloved by his Friends &hellip; The love of God being shed abroad in his heart, he preferred the Lord's business to his own and when he felt divine drawings to visit the Churches he resigned himself fully. (<span class="italic">Testimonies</span>, 3.87)</blockquote>
