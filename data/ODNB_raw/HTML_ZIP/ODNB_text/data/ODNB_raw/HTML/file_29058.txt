<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>, earl of Cleveland  (1591&#150;1667), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the elder son of Henry Wentworth, third Baron Wentworth of Nettlestead (1558&#150;1593), and his wife, Anne Hopton (<i>d</i>. 1625). Wentworth matriculated, with his brother Henry, at Trinity College, Oxford, on 12 November 1602, and they appeared before James I at Christ Church on 27 August 1605. Thomas was created a knight of the Bath on 4 June 1610, and in 1611 he married Anne Crofts (<i>d</i>. 1638). Their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29057/', "Thomas Wentworth, fifth Baron Wentworth")</script>. On the death of his great-aunt Jane Wentworth, widow of Henry, Lord Cheney, on 16 April 1614, he inherited the estate of Toddington in Bedfordshire, which henceforth became his principal residence. He became <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Bedfordshire in 1619, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 9 March 1620. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Bedfordshire on 5 May 1625, an office that he continued to hold until 1642.<br>
<br>Wentworth regularly attended the Lords throughout the parliaments of the 1620s, although there is no evidence that he was a frequent speaker. He nevertheless secured Buckingham's patronage and this helps to explain his creation as earl of Cleveland on 7 February 1626. The following year he served under Buckingham in the expedition to La Rochelle, and in August 1628 he was present when John Felton assassinated the duke at Portsmouth. As the 1630s progressed, Cleveland's extravagant lifestyle led him deeper and deeper into debt and prompted him to raise loans from various notable figures. For example, in September 1634 he borrowed &pound;10,000 from Anne, Viscountess Dorchester, while the following year he obtained a loan of &pound;2000 from Mary, countess of Home. By 1637 many of his lands in Bedfordshire and Middlesex were heavily encumbered (especially the manors of Stepney and Hackney), while his debts were thought to stand at &pound;19,200. Three years later his total debts were estimated at &pound;60,100. When the Long Parliament met, Cleveland introduced a private bill that would have enabled him to sell some of his lands and use the proceeds to pay off his debts, but a number of individuals submitted petitions against the bill pointing out that by this time the earl leased, rather than owned, many of his lands and was therefore not entitled to sell them.<br>
<br>Cleveland's first wife died on 16 January 1638, and by 25 October that year he had married his second wife, Lucy Wentworth (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Sir John Wentworth, baronet, of Gosfield, Essex. The following year Cleveland joined the king with ten troops in the first bishops' war, and he also was present during the second war. He was friendly with his distant kinsman Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, and in January 1641 was sworn as a defence witness in Strafford's trial. On 10 May 1641 the Lords ordered Cleveland to convey to Strafford the king's consent to his attainder, and two days later he attended the earl to the scaffold. On 5 March 1642 he was among the sixteen peers who entered protestations against the militia ordinance, and at the beginning of the civil war he became captain of the gentlemen pensioners. He may have been at Edgehill, and he was wounded at the first battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643.<br>
<br>Cleveland sat in the Oxford parliament which assembled in January 1644, and during the following summer he emerged as a highly successful cavalry commander. On the night of 29 May 1644 he surprised Abingdon with a party of 150 horse, but he was forced to retreat and lost his prisoners. This was a bold move that prompted Clarendon later to characterize Cleveland as &#145;a man of signal courage, and an excellent officer upon any bold enterprise&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.352). At Cropredy Bridge on 29 June Cleveland led a cavalry charge against Sir William Waller, and then, after a second charge, succeeded in driving Waller back over the bridge. He was then sent to Cornwall, where on 30 August near Fowey he made an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the flight of Essex's cavalry after their defeat at Lostwithiel. He helped to relieve Portland Castle on 14 October, and on 27 October he commanded the left wing of the royalist cavalry at the second battle of Newbury. During the charge his horse fell under him and he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower. The houses refused requests for him to be exchanged for a parliamentarian prisoner, although he was periodically granted bail for three or four months at a time. In July 1647 he wrote to Prince Charles pledging his loyalty despite his confinement, and the following year he was in Colchester during the siege. In September 1648&#151;after producing a doctor's certificate stating that he needed fresh air and more exercise&#151;he was granted bail for a further three months. Shortly before that period expired in December he escaped to the continent, and by June 1649 he had joined Charles II at The Hague.<br>
<br>By April 1650 Cleveland was in attendance on Charles II at Beauvais, where it was reported that he threatened to cane or beat anyone who called him a presbyterian. He sailed for Scotland with Charles on 2 June 1650, but he and his son were required to leave Scotland in October for refusing to take the covenant. He commanded a regiment of horse at the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and by a daring charge in the streets of the city gave Charles enough time to escape. Cleveland himself was captured on 13 September at Woodcote in Shropshire and was committed to the Tower. At his trial on 29 October he narrowly escaped the death sentence through the casting vote of Lord Mordaunt. Shortly afterwards Cleveland's second wife died on 23 November and was buried at Toddington. He remained a prisoner until 20 July 1658, although he was granted the liberty of the Tower on 16 February 1652. On his release he may have retired to Lord Lovelace's house at Water Eaton, near Oxford, and in 1659 royalist agents listed him as a possible activist in Booth's rising.<br>
<br>Early in the civil war Cleveland's estates had been sequestrated, and on 17 November 1645 the committee for the advance of money set his fine at &pound;2000. In August 1650 the total debts of him and his son were estimated at &pound;100,000. Proceedings in the committee for compounding with delinquents dragged on until 1655, by which time nearly all his landed property was leased or sold to creditors.<br>
<br>Cleveland re-emerged at the Restoration, and at the king's entry into London on 29 May 1660 he led a regiment of 300 horse from Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. On 20 June he was reappointed captain of the gentlemen pensioners, and the following month lord lieutenant of Bedfordshire; he continued to hold both offices until his death. He was appointed colonel of a regiment of horse on 1 September 1662. John Evelyn described a review in Hyde Park on 4 July 1663 in which &#145;the old Earle of Cleveland trail'd a pike, and led the right-hand file in a foote company, commanded by the Lord Wentworth, his son, a worthy spectacle and example, being both of them old and valiant souldiers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary and Correspondence of John Evelyn</span>, ed. W. Bray, new edn, ed. H. B. Wheatley, 4 vols., 1906, 2.159). In January 1666 Cleveland was instructed to raise a regiment of 500 horse for use in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, but in August the regiment was disbanded without seeing military action.<br>
<br>Cleveland was not permitted to repossess lands that he had sold in order to pay his composition fine, and between 1660 and 1667 three private acts of parliament were passed enabling him to sell certain settled lands for the benefit of his creditors. On 13 March 1667 Lady Wentworth wrote that only a &#145;litle remnant of Lord Cleveland's estate&#146; was left  (Lady Wentworth to [Joseph Williamson], TNA: PRO, SP 29/193/109). Less than two weeks later, on 25 March, Cleveland died; he was buried on 4 April at Toddington.<br>
<br>One leading military historian has described Cleveland as &#145;a much underrated field commander&#146;  (Newman, 403), and his relative posthumous obscurity belies the positive impression that he made on a number of contemporaries. Clarendon's favourable assessment has already been quoted, and Sir Philip Warwick similarly regarded Cleveland as &#145;a nobleman of daring courage, full of industry and activity, as well as firm loyalty, and usually successful in what he attempted&#146;  (Warwick, 270).<br>
