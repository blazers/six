<span class="headword">Oldham,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1450&#150;1519), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was a younger son of Roger and Margery Oldham, apparently minor gentry with property at Ancoats in Salford, Lancashire. His brother Bernard (<i>d</i>. 1515) also became a cleric, rising, by his brother's gift, to be archdeacon of Cornwall and treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. Hugh Oldham is first mentioned as a &#145;clerk, of Durham&#146; in 1475, which suggests that he was born about 1450 and brought up or given early employment in the household of Laurence Booth, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1480), whose own family came from Barton, near Eccles, which was close to Ancoats. By 1488 he was rector of Lanivet, Cornwall, and servant to William Smith (<i>d</i>. 1514), keeper of the hanaper in the royal chancery. He also attended university, although it is not clear when. In 1493, on a claim of having studied arts for four years and canon and civil law for four, at Oxford in each case, he was granted a grace to enter in law at Cambridge, evidently as a bachelor of civil (and perhaps canon) law, not as a doctor. There is no contemporary evidence to support Thomas Fuller's assertion of 1662 that he was a member of Queens' College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>By 1492 Oldham had entered the service of Lady Margaret Beaufort, countess of Richmond and Derby (<i>d</i>. 1509)&#151;a relationship that seems to have begun in his maturity, rather than through his being educated by her as used to be supposed. He was receiver of her west country estates in that year and rose to be chancellor of her household by 1503, a position he resigned on becoming a bishop. Another of his patrons was his old employer William Smith, now bishop of Lichfield, who in 1496 made Oldham master of the hospital of St John, Lichfield, which Smith had recently reformed to include a free grammar school and almshouse; the post did not require residence. During the 1490s Oldham gained a large amount of church preferment, including cathedral canonries at Exeter, Lichfield, Lincoln, St Paul's, Salisbury, and York, several parochial benefices, the deanery of Wimborne, Dorset in 1499, and the archdeaconry of Exeter about 1502. By 24 January 1503 he was important enough to be included in the group of leading clergy and laity who laid the foundation stone of Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. On 27 November 1504 he was provided by the pope to be bishop of Exeter and was consecrated on 12 January 1505. Later tradition at Exeter attributed this promotion to Lady Margaret's influence.<br>
<br>Oldham's episcopal register, though informative, is only a selective record of his activities, but he seems to have been a conscientious bishop. He anticipated the Reformation by annexing the decayed hospitals of Clyst Gabriel and Warland, Devon, to the vicars-choral of Exeter Cathedral to provide common meals in their college (1508&#150;9). He issued statutes for the cathedral in 1511, regulating a wide variety of matters, and joined with Sir John Speke, a local knight, in adding two new chapels to the east end of the building. His closure of Warland Hospital in 1509 involved a successful struggle with the Trinitarian friars of Hounslow, Middlesex, who claimed the place as their house, but his attempts to exert authority over the Benedictine abbey of Tavistock, Devon, were frustrated in 1517 when the abbey gained papal exemption from episcopal jurisdiction. The Exeter historian John Hooker, who collected memories of Oldham in the later sixteenth century, wrote that &#145;albeit he was not very much learned, yet [he was] a great favourer and a friend both to learning and to learned men&#146;  (Exeter City Archives, bk 51, fol. 337<i>r</i>). This is supported by evidence of an examination system for ordination candidates during his reign, and by his choice of university graduates for most of the diocesan officers and cathedral clergy whom he appointed. Like William Smith and Richard Fox (<i>d</i>. 1528), bishop of Durham and Winchester, with whom he had close relationships, he developed a strong interest in promoting education. At Exeter he ordered the adolescent clerks of the cathedral choir to attend the city high school, while at Manchester, near his place of origin, he played a major role in establishing the free grammar school, a project which had begun in 1508. Oldham gave money and property to the school, and its statutes (1515, revised in 1525), which adopted practices from the school foundations of William Smith at Banbury, Oxfordshire, and John Colet at St Paul's, London, probably reflect his influence.<br>
<br>Oldham also patronized higher education. According to Hooker, he thought of assisting Exeter College, Oxford, and William Smith's new college of Brasenose there, but was rebuffed in both cases&#151;an assertion untrue in the case of Brasenose, where Oldham's coat of arms formerly appeared in a library window. His chief university benefaction, however, was directed to Richard Fox's Oxford foundation, Corpus Christi College. Oldham gave &pound;4000 and land in Chelsea towards the project, was officially recognized as a benefactor, and was commemorated in daily prayers. Fox's first known scheme for this college, dated 1513, envisaged a foundation for monks and secular scholars, but in 1517, when the first statutes were issued, the monks were omitted. The Exeter tradition collected by Hooker attributed this change to Oldham, who allegedly counselled Fox that &#145;monks were but a sort of bussing [buzzing] flies, and whose state could not long endure&#146;  (Vowell, fol. h2), or, as another version of the story put it, &#145;What, my lord, shall we build houses and provide livelihoods for a company of bussing monks, whose end and fall we ourselves may live to see?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 3.617). The anecdote probably takes some of its colour from post-Reformation hindsight.<br>
<br>Hooker summarized Oldham as &#145;a man having more zeal than knowledge and more devotion than learning; somewhat rough in speeches but friendly in doings&#146;  (Vowell, fol. h2). The bishop made his will on 16 December 1518. He died on 25 June 1519, and was buried in the chapel he had built in Exeter Cathedral and dedicated to St Saviour. His tomb includes a painted effigy and there is a portrait of him at Corpus Christi College.<br>
