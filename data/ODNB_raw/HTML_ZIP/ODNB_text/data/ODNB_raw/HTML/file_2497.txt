<span class="headword">Black,  Robert</span>  (1752&#150;1817), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster</span>, was the eldest son of Valentine Black, a farmer at Mullabrack, co. Armagh. In 1770 he entered the class of ethics under Dr Thomas Reid at Glasgow University. He was licensed by the Armagh presbytery, declined in 1776 a call to Keady, co. Armagh, and in the following year, on the death of Alexander Colville MD, the non-subscribing minister of Dromore, co. Down, he accepted the call of this congregation, which returned to the jurisdiction of the General Synod of Ulster. Black was ordained at Dromore by the Armagh presbytery on 28 June 1777. On 15 February 1782 he attended the convention of Irish volunteers at Dungannon as Captain Robert Black (Dromore first company) and seconded the resolution adopted in favour of Catholic emancipation. He attended also the second great Dungannon convention, on 8 September 1783, when his eloquence attracted the attention of Frederick Augustus, earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry, and of Robert Moore of Molenan, near Londonderry. Hence his call to First Derry, where he was installed by the Londonderry presbytery on 7 January 1784 as colleague to David Young. Black, whom contemporaries described as a handsome man of dark complexion, aquiline features, and a commanding presence, married his cousin Margaret Black (<i>d</i>. 1824).<br>
<br>On 2 December 1788 Black was elected synod agent for the <i>regium donum</i> (the small royal bounty paid to Irish Presbyterian ministers since the reign of Charles II), in succession to James Laing. He delivered an applauded oration at the centenary commemoration (7 December 1788) of the closing of the gates of Londonderry, an occasion which was (unusually) celebrated by both religious traditions. As agent for the royal bounty he exerted himself to secure its augmentation; in 1792, through the influence of the earl of Charlemont, Henry Grattan, and Colonel Stewart of Killymoon, the Irish parliament added &pound;500 a year to the grant. In gratitude for his services the synod, in 1793, presented Black with a piece of plate.<br>
<br>The seditious tendencies that began to appear in the volunteer movement in the early 1790s alarmed Black and he delivered a solemn warning against them in a speech at a meeting of the parishioners of Templemore, held in Londonderry Cathedral on 14 January 1793. He never, however, receded from the positions he had taken in favour of parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation. In the rising of 1798 he was strongly on the side of constituted authority and had great influence as the friend and correspondent of Lord Castlereagh. One form in which this influence was exercised was a further increase of the <i>regium donum</i>, which from 1804 was distributed in three classes (&pound;100, &pound;75, and &pound;50), the agent being henceforth appointed not by the synod but by the government. Black held this office until his death and did not scruple to use the power it gave him. Opponents called him &#145;the unmitred bishop&#146; and &#145;chief consul of the general synod&#146;. In 1800 or 1801 the degree of DD was sent him by an American college. As a speaker he had no equal in his day.<br>
<br>In theology Black was suspected of the heresy of not believing in the divinity of Christ, a view which seemed to be confirmed when, in 1804, he endeavoured to secure as his colleague William Porter, whose Arianism was openly known. Black's local prestige was impaired by the circumstances of Castlereagh's defeat at the County Down election of 1805, but his influence at Dublin Castle was equally strong with all ministries. In 1809 the synod publicly thanked him for his exertions in procuring the act of parliament incorporating the widows' fund. In 1813 his controversy with William Steel Dickson, who was implicated in the rising of 1798, was ended by a synodical resolution declaring that words in a previous resolution (1799), complained of by Dickson, had been &#145;inaccurately used&#146;. Black's influence, however, was still powerful enough to cause the expulsion of an elder who, in the course of debate, had laid charges against him in connection with the bounty; he published an account of these proceedings in 1814. Black was opposed to the establishment of the Belfast Academical Institution (opened 1814), which, it was hoped, would develop into a college for training Presbyterian ministers. At the synod of 1815, in Black's absence, a resolution was passed in the institution's favour, and in the same year the government made it an annual grant of &pound;1500. The grant was withdrawn on political grounds the following year after some of the managers were accused of drinking disloyal toasts on St Patrick's day, and Black vainly endeavoured, in two successive years, to obtain the permanent rescinding of the synod's resolution. His defeat was softened by a less than successful public dinner that was given by his admirers in Belfast.<br>
<br>Black outlived his power and popularity. His ambition could not brook repulses; his temperament alternated between geniality and gloom. Loss of leadership unhinged his spirit and he threw himself over the railing of Londonderry Bridge and was drowned in the Foyle on the evening of 4 December 1817. His body later disappeared from its grave. He was survived by his wife, who died in April 1824, and by three sons and two daughters.<br>
