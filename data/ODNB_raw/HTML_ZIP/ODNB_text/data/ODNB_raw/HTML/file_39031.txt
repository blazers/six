<span class="headword">Murphy,  Frank</span>  (1889&#150;1955), <span class="occ">radio manufacturer</span>, was born on 16 June 1889 at Penwith Villa, 25 Wrottesley Road, West Plumstead, Woolwich, London, the youngest son of the seven surviving children of John James Murphy (1853&#150;1917), schoolmaster, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leggo (1855&#150;1924). Following John Murphy's appointment as headmaster of Holmes Road School, Kentish Town, in north London, the family moved to Upper Holloway in 1890, but returned to Plumstead shortly afterwards, where Frank and his younger sister Ethel were enrolled in the local board school.<br>
<br>From an early age, Frank Murphy displayed a precocious talent for mathematics. He won a scholarship to the East London Technical College, graduating in 1908 with honours in electrical engineering, but lack of funds prevented him from taking up the offer of a mathematics exhibition at St John's College, Oxford. Although not apparent at the time, the frustration and resentment at this checked potential was to mark much of his private life and business career. Murphy was an essentially serious young man, regularly attending the Highgate Road Baptist Chapel where he met, then married on 22 June 1912, his first wife, Hilda Constance (1889&#150;1980), the only child of Charles and Edith Howe of Tufnell Park. The following year the first of three children was born. At the time, Murphy was working as a Post Office engineer, a step up from his first job on the assembly line at the Western Electric Company at Woolwich, where the tedium was relieved by postgraduate evening classes on the development of the cathode ray tube.<br>
<br>In 1916, when the Post Office released him for military service, Murphy was sent to France as a squadron wireless operator, to be recalled just eight months later to set up an officers' wireless training school at Farnborough, returning to France some weeks later to take charge of the ground-to-air communications operating between Folkestone and Cologne. By the time of his demobilization in 1919, Murphy's future career was still an issue, but after a chance meeting with (Charles) Rupert Casson, a budding copywriter, the two men formed the Engineering Publicity Service (EPS), an advertising company with clients in the engineering field. By 1924 EPS had changed its name to Murphy Casson Ltd, and over the next four years rising profits provided the Murphy family with a comfortable standard of living. Yet material security offered scant compensation for unexplored talents and in 1928 Murphy announced his intended withdrawal from the partnership in order to start his own radio manufacturing company.<br>
<br>Murphy Radio Ltd, located in the new Welwyn Garden City, was registered on 9 September 1929 with a nominal capital of &pound;6000 and a staff of seven. By 1936 the company was acknowledged as one of the leaders in the field, with 600 staff at Welwyn and sales at an all-time high. With the help of his erstwhile business partner, Murphy set about establishing two fundamental principles&#151;reliability and value for money. Full-page advertisements ran in the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> featuring Murphy himself, promoting the notion of &#145;a square deal&#146; rather than the technical wizardry favoured by his competitors. The image of the homely and dependable managing director, &#145;the man with the pipe&#146;, had particular resonance during the uncertainty of the depression. With only approved Murphy dealers supplying and servicing his sets, costs could be pared to the bone and the risks of buying through &#145;contacts in the trade&#146; were eliminated. <span class="italic">Murphy News</span>, the in-house magazine begun in 1933, encouraged all employees to share the same level of business integrity vaunted by Murphy.<br>
<br>In January 1937 Murphy chose to announce his resignation from the board to start a new venture producing and selling good-quality furniture for the mass market. For many years his personal philosophy, that of applied knowledge, had been in conflict with the need to generate profits for shareholders. Murphy fervently believed that industry should be governed by a constitution enshrining workers' rights and obligations. The time between his resignation and the registration of Frank Murphy Ltd in 1938 was taken up with the preparation of a prospectus entitled <span class="italic">A New Conception for Business</span>. Murphy set out six basic principles based on the acceptance of applying knowledge with integrity in the service of society. Not surprisingly, these rather esoteric views found few takers and within two years the liabilities of the company were too great for it to continue in business. The long process of winding up was begun and Murphy again found himself subject to the same pattern of high promise and dashed hopes.<br>
<br>The pressure on his marriage from failed business ventures, combined with the unexpected death of his elder son in 1942, led Murphy to spend increasing time with his widowed daughter-in-law, Audrey, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips (<i>b</i>. 1912), and her two children. The endless gossip generated by this liaison finally broke his marriage and in 1947 he emigrated to Canada with Audrey in a last effort to get his ideas accepted. Their short-lived marriage (annulled in 1949) underscored the forlorn task Murphy had set himself. The one time &#145;face of radio&#146;, a man of unquestionable intellectual capacity, found no ready market in Canada and instead was reduced to taking on odd jobs and driving taxis. Shortly before his death in Toronto on 26 January 1955, Murphy secured the post of mathematics teacher at a Toronto high school, completing a life of elusive promise.<br>
