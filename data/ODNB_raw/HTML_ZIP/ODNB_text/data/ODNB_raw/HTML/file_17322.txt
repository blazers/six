<span class="headword">Maberly,  Frederick Herbert</span>  (1781&#150;1860), <span class="occ">politician and Church of England clergyman</span>, born on 18 April 1781, was the son of Stephen Maberly of Reading and London. Educated at Westminster School, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 23 April 1802, graduating BA in 1806 and MA in 1809. He was ordained to the curacy of Bourn, near Caxton, and in 1807 married, at Bourn, Ann Kimpton. He soon began to display the eccentricity for which he later became notorious. At Chesterton, near Cambridge, he erected, for no declared reason and at great expense, a large dwelling, of which all the rooms were on one floor. In politics he was at this time a whig, but his anti-popish zeal was so fanatical that he resisted the movement for Catholic emancipation with the utmost determination, and increasingly represented ultra-tory views. About 1812 he travelled all over England in a van distributing tons of protestant tracts. His pamphlet <span class="italic">The Melancholy and Awful Death of Lawrence Dundas, Esq., an Undergraduate of Trinity College</span> (1818) was hyperbolic in tone and denounced the Fitzwilliam Museum for exhibiting &#145;disgraceful and licentious pictures&#146; which would lead undergraduates &#145;to the commission of fornication&#146;. None the less, it called attention to the lax supervision of undergraduates in lodgings in the town of Cambridge, and led to the introduction of a system of licences on 27 March 1818.<br>
<br>In 1826 Maberly took an active part in the opposition to Lord John Russell's re-election for the county of Huntingdon. In 1829, when the sheriff of Cambridgeshire declined a requisition to call a meeting to oppose the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span>, Maberly issued a manifesto, dated 2 April  (Cooper, 4.560), declaring that on 11 April, the occasion of the execution of a criminal then under sentence of death, he would address the crowd and move a resolution in favour of a petition for the impeachment of Wellington and Peel. Under pressure from the county magistracy he abandoned his intention on 9 April, but he subsequently appeared at the bar of the House of Lords to impeach the duke of Wellington and was summarily ejected. In 1834 he strenuously opposed the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span>, and on 11 June 1836 assembled a large meeting of labourers, principally from outlying villages, on Parker's Piece in Cambridge, to protest against the act and the way it was being implemented. On 26 July 1837 he was charged with assaulting a constable. In the meantime, during the brief tory government of 1834&#150;5, he received from the bishop of Ely the rectory of Finborough in Suffolk, effectively a reward for his staunch support of the tory party. There his political activities diminished and he gave away much of his salary to the poor, so that when he died at Stowmarket on 24 January 1860 he left his family much impoverished.<br>
