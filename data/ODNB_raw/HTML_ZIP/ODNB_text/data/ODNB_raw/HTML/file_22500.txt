<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  John William</span>, fourth earl of Bessborough  (1781&#150;1847), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 31 August 1781, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63967/', "Frederick Ponsonby, third earl of Bessborough (1758&#150;1844)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38506/', "Henrietta Frances Ponsonby (1761&#150;1821)")</script>, the second daughter of John, first Earl Spencer, and was baptized at St Marylebone. From 11 March 1793 he was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Duncannon until, in July 1834, he was himself created Baron Duncannon and called to the House of Lords; on 3 February 1844 he succeeded his father as fourth earl of Bessborough. On 16 November 1805 he married, at her father's house in Berkeley Square, Lady Maria Fane, third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9136/', "John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland")</script>, and his first wife, Sarah Anne Child (daughter and heir of Robert Child of Osterley Park, Middlesex) with whom he had eight sons, including the cricketer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22494/', "Frederick George Brabazon Ponsonby")</script>, and six daughters; she had been born on 11 May 1787 and she died on 19 March 1834. Duncannon attended Harrow School (1790&#150;98), matriculated at Oxford (Christ Church) on 14 October 1799, and was created MA on 23 June 1802. In 1800 and 1802&#150;3 he travelled on the continent.<br>
<br>The Ponsonbys formed an integral part of the whig political and social cousinage and Duncannon was related to many of the leading figures who supported the whig cause. During his early years in the House of Commons he represented boroughs controlled by whig patrons: Knaresborough (Devonshire) in 1805&#150;6, Higham Ferrers (Fitzwilliam) in 1810&#150;12, and Malton (Fitzwilliam) in 1812&#150;26. He unsuccessfully contested St Albans in 1807 on the interest of his maternal uncle, Earl Spencer. As, however, his father's chief residence was at Bessborough House in co. Kilkenny and all the family's lands (reckoned in the 1870s to amount to 35,440 acres with a gross annual value of &pound;22,384) lay in Ireland, he moved in 1826 to the co. Kilkenny constituency, for which he sat until 1832, though not without some (temporary) opposition from the O'Connellite party at a by-election in February 1831. From 1832 until July 1834 he was MP for Nottingham. He was lord lieutenant of co. Carlow in 1831&#150;8 and of co. Kilkenny in 1838&#150;47.<br>
<br>Although Duncannon's parliamentary activity was at first modest&#151;and he remained a poor speaker throughout his life&#151;his social poise and lively sense of humour soon made him a popular political figure. Within a decade of entering parliament he had become an important member of the Holland House circle [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>]. By 1817 his talents for efficient and unobtrusive organization were well enough established for him to be involved in high-level discussions concerning whig tactics. Indeed, the party leadership in the Commons might have been his had he not disliked debate and preferred the backstairs role of whip under the nominal supervision of his cousin, George Ponsonby (1807&#150;17) and of George Tierney (1817&#150;27).<br>
<br>As an early nineteenth-century politician Duncannon's most important contributions fall under three main headings: his role as negotiator and manager; his membership of the committee which drew up the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1831; and the connecting link which he provided between the whig leadership and O'Connell's political movement in Ireland. Throughout the 1820s he, Russell, Ebrington, and Normanby constituted a coherent group under Holland's patronage determined to spur the ageing party leadership into more determined opposition. Both then and in the 1830s he played an active part in organizing elections in England and Ireland and stood out for his willingness to concern himself with the often tedious details of selecting suitable candidates, raising money, and orchestrating local campaigns. The necessity of finding room in Grey's administration for Canningites, Huskissonites, reformers, and others meant that he obtained the comparatively poor reward of being appointed in February 1831 first commissioner of woods and forests (and also sworn of the privy council). He held this post (outside the cabinet) until Grey retired in July 1834 when he was appointed to the cabinet as home secretary by his brother-in-law, Melbourne. After the brief tory ministry of November 1834 to April 1835 he was re-appointed to the woods and forests (and was also lord privy seal until January 1840) with a seat in the cabinet, and held that post until the defeat of Melbourne's ministry in August 1841. Although he headed an important spending ministry for more than nine years and was responsible for an imaginative public parks programme and for much of the building of the new houses of parliament, Duncannon's talents lay more in the area of party manoeuvring and policy formation than in administration.<br>
<br>In 1831 Grey asked Durham, Russell, Graham, and Duncannon to form a committee to draw up proposals for reform bills. Durham proved the most radical of the group, Graham the most conservative. Duncannon probably owed his position to his friendship with O'Connell (whose parliamentary support was badly needed) and to his expertise on Irish matters generally. He fully approved of the committee's comparatively dramatic proposals, including that for the introduction of the secret ballot (though this was rejected by the cabinet). Although his draft <span class="roman">Irish Reform Bill</span> was designed to produce an electorate proportionate to that of England and Wales, it was later greatly watered down by the Irish chief secretary, Stanley (later fourteenth earl of Derby), who was probably also largely responsible for the <span class="roman">Irish Reform Act's</span> poor drafting and manifold technical inadequacies.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1830s Duncannon belonged to that group of aristocratic whigs who supported a forward policy of reform over a wide field. As such he tended to act with men like Russell rather than with more resistant figures like Lansdowne or Melbourne himself. His talents as a negotiator were formidable: &#145;the only one among us&#146;, noted Holland in 1839, &#145;(and by far the best that could be selected among us) who is in friendly communication with all parties and enjoys in any degree the confidence of all&#146;. And it was largely his efforts which brought about the adherence of O'Connell and his party to the Lichfield House compact of 1835 by which the Irish agreed to act with whigs and reformers in return for concessions short of repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. More generally, Duncannon played the part of intermediary between O'Connell and whig administrations, an arrangement which suited all concerned: O'Connell was able to obtain minor favours as well as hints about possible shifts in policy; the whigs were able to deal with the Irish without having to meet them much directly. Duncannon increased yet further his indispensability as a universal go-between.<br>
<br>After Melbourne's defeat in 1841 Duncannon became less active politically. He concentrated upon his estates and succeeded as fourth earl of Bessborough in 1844. In July 1846, however, Russell appointed him to the post of lord lieutenant of Ireland, the first resident Irish landlord to hold that office for very many years. Although his intentions were of the best, his efforts as viceroy were overwhelmed by the potato blight and famine which had begun the previous year. Russell's determination to make the Irish landlords pay for relief, though utterly unrealistic, proved too great an obstacle for even a politician of Bessborough's experience who clearly saw that greater government help and intervention were required. &#145;I know all the difficulties&#146;, he told Russell in January 1847, &#145;that arrive when you begin to interfere with trade, but it is difficult to persuade a starving population that one class should be permitted to make 50 per cent by the sale of provisions, while they are dying in want of them&#146;  (Russell MSS, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/22/6). By then Bessborough was, in any case, a sick man, and he died at Dublin Castle, surrounded by seventeen members of his family, on 16 May 1847 of (according to contemporary diagnoses) hydrothorax or dropsy on the chest. He was buried at Fiddown, some 3 miles from Bessborough House, on 22 May.<br>
<br>Bessborough's latter years had been somewhat marred by an over-fondness for alcohol and by an equally public involvement with a series of married women. Already as a young man he had disturbed his parents with a variety of flirtations; as viceroy (and by then a widower) he was constantly in the company of the novelist Catherine Charlotte Maberly (1805&#150;1875), the wife of William Leader Maberly (1798&#150;1885), joint-secretary of the General Post Office, whose &#145;ostentatious effrontery&#146; Greville noted, generated &#145;universal ridicule and disgust&#146;. Yet until the end Bessborough, as Greville also observed, continued, in every other respect, to be remarkable for:<blockquote>calm and unruffled temper and very good sound sense. The consequence was that he was consulted by everybody, and universally and constantly employed in the arrangement of difficulties, the adjustment of rival pretensions, and the reconciliation of differences, for which purposes some such man is indispensable and invaluable in every great political association. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 5.447)</blockquote>
