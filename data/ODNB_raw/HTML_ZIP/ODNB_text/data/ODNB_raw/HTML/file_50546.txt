<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Arthur Terence</span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">banker and company director</span>, was born at Rosslyn, Hammers Lane, Mill Hill, near Hendon, Middlesex, on 19 January 1905, the only son, in a family of one son and one daughter, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58511/', "Brigadier-General Sir Arthur Maxwell (1875&#150;1935)")</script>, banker and company director, of Mill Hill, and his wife, Eva Jones. Educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he took an MA, Maxwell travelled in Africa on a James Whitehead scholarship, and in South America, before being admitted to the bar in 1929.<br>
<br>Maxwell chose a career in the City, joining the long-established firm of private bankers, Glyn, Mills &amp; Co., where his father was a managing partner. Glyn Mills's many connections, together with those that sprang from his marriage in 1935 to Beatrice Diane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32351/', "Sir J. Austen Chamberlain, MP")</script>, and his wife, Ivy, provided the tall and powerfully built young Maxwell with stepping stones for new interests. He and his wife had two daughters and a son. On his father's death in 1935, Maxwell became a director of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co., and also succeeded him as a director of the Union Bank of Australia, one of the oldest British overseas banks, with whom the Glyn and Mills families had been associated since the 1850s.<br>
<br>Maxwell embarked upon a career that made a decisive contribution to British banking interests in Australia and New Zealand. He was a director of the Union Bank, and its deputy chairman and chairman in 1949 and 1950, respectively. The merger of the Union Bank and the Bank of Australasia in 1951 to form the Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) signalled a revitalized British presence in Australasia after decades of declining influence. Maxwell played a key role in the creation of the new bank. It was he who was instrumental in renegotiating the terms of the merger to promote the interests of the Union Bank. He was largely responsible for the resolution of the many complex legal and operational issues still outstanding before the merger could be consummated. However, the vigour with which Maxwell pressed his own claims and those of his bank rankled the directors of the Bank of Australasia who felt that the surrender of their royal charter was more than sufficient sacrifice. In these circumstances it was not surprising that Maxwell was denied the ultimate prize of chairmanship that went to Sir Geoffrey Cokayne Gibbs (1901&#150;1975).<br>
<br>As deputy chairman of ANZ Bank, now the second largest private bank in Australia, and as chairman of its standing committee, a position of <i>de facto</i> executive director, Maxwell exerted a dominant role in the new institution, overshadowing the urbane and more diplomatic Gibbs. As a frequent visitor to the Antipodes, Maxwell displayed a &#145;hands on&#146; style of management. His ambitious vision of ANZ as an international bank with a significant presence in the City of London was effectively thwarted by the restrictive policies of the Australian monetary authorities in the early 1950s. Nevertheless, ANZ improved its position in its domestic markets, and spread its business into new areas such as savings banking and hire purchase. Maxwell stood down as deputy chairman in 1965. His other business interests and advancing years demanded a lessening of his commitment to the organization he had done so much to build. Maxwell sat on the board of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, which resulted from the merger of ANZ and the other British bank, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, in 1969. He remained as a director until the ANZ's transfer of domicile to Australia in 1976. By that stage leadership had passed to others.<br>
<br>While his involvement with the Union Bank and ANZ took up much of his time, Maxwell had diverse interests. He sat on many other boards, including Vickers, and was chairman of the Powers-Samas Accounting Machines, which merged with International Computers and Tabulators to become International Computers Limited. Maxwell served in the Territorial Army of Britain from 1923 to 1935 in the 7th City of London regiment (Post Office Rifles) and in 1935 was promoted to captain in the reserve of officers. He held a number of staff posts during the war, notably that of deputy chief of military government section attached to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, on the staff of General Eisenhower. His rank was that of colonel. Maxwell was also active in civic affairs, being a governor of Rugby School and the British representative on the investment committee of the International Labour Organization; he also sat on a government inquiry into rural bus services, as well as serving a number of charitable causes, including the Royal Hospital for the Incurables.<br>
<br>Maxwell's achievements, although considerable, never matched those of his illustrious father and father-in-law. The creation of ANZ, which remains, together with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Standard Chartered, one of the survivors of the earlier wave of British overseas banks, is his most enduring legacy. Maxwell died at his home, Roveries Hall, Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, on 27 June 1991, after a long illness, and was buried on 2 July at Lydham parish church, Bishop's Castle. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
