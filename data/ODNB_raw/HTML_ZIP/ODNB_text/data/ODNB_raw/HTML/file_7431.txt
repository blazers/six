<span class="headword">Delamaine <span class="st"> [Delamain]</span>,  Richard, the younger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was baptized on 7 or 8 March 1627 at St Andrew's, Holborn, in London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7430/', "Richard Delamain the elder (d. 1644?)")</script>, mathematician, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. in or after 1645). The Muggletonian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7429/', "Alexander Delamaine (bap. 1631, d. 1685)")</script> was his younger brother. He once reportedly claimed to have attended Oxford University, but there is no evidence for this, and confidence is not strengthened by the tale that when asked which college he attended, he replied Emmanuel. Delamaine made his first fleeting entrance on the public stage with the presentation to the House of Lords, early in 1642, of a tabulated ready-reckoner setting out the rates at which investments might be made in land in the respective provinces of Ireland, by the terms of the recently passed act for the Irish adventure. This the Lords authorized for publication.<br>
<br>Like his father, who appears to have had a hand in the fortification of London during the civil war, Richard the younger supported the parliamentarians, but he made no real mark on affairs until 1648, whereafter he became established as a preacher in Herefordshire. In 1654 his behaviour there came under fire from an anonymous writer in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Impostor magnus: the legerdemain of Richard Delamain, now preacher in the city of Hereford. Being a narrative of his life and doctrine since his first coming into that county</span>. Its author lambasted Delamaine's ignorance of gospel, deriding his &#145;notional frenzy&#146; and &#145;familistical carriages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Impostor magnus</span>, 15). He also decried the dangers to which heretics such as Delamaine exposed government, property, and civil society itself. Much of the tract is taken up with allegations about moral incontinence, hypocrisy, and aggressive nest-feathering which were a commonplace of parliamentarian factional infighting in the period. Despite its full title, little is revealed concerning the details of Delamaine's life except that he had apparently undergone some sort of conversion experience, had been &#145;brought&#146; to Herefordshire by one Mr Hill, whose religion the author considered heretical, and that he had then enjoyed the patronage of several godly women in Bredwardine. Mention is made of an interlude at Worcester. But it was in the city of Hereford itself that he came good. Becoming an intimate of the governor, Lieutenant-Colonel Wroth Rogers, Delamaine appears to have taken some sort of responsibility for the ordnance of the castle. He was also said to have won favour in the eyes of Major-General Thomas Harrison. He had promises of employment as muster-master and either clerk or trooper in the horse troop of the county, and may have seen action during the Worcester emergency. He made several attempts to secure himself ministerial livings around Herefordshire. In 1652 he got himself one of the three posts at Hereford Cathedral maintained by an ordinance of parliament since 1646. It was alleged that he had to be &#145;shamed&#146; into surrendering the other parishes for which he was responsible. With the support of Wroth Rogers, Delamaine obtained the mastership of St Ethelbert's Hospital in Hereford and the control of a charitable foundation there in 1653. The same year, and possibly on the same account, he was also in receipt of a clerical augmentation.<br>
<br>Whatever the truth of the various allegations levelled at him in 1654, there can be little doubt that Delamaine was deeply implicated in a vigorous struggle for dominance in Hereford during the 1650s. While there he married a woman called Mary, whom his detractor described as a serving woman to the wife of Wroth Rogers. Their son was christened Wroth. Delamaine made his will on 26 April 1657 and died some time between then and 14 August when the document was proved. He left a daughter, Elizabeth, as well as his son, neither of whom had attained majority by the time of their father's death.<br>
