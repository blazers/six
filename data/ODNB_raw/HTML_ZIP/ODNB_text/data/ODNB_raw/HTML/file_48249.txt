<span class="headword">Bignold,  Thomas</span>  (1761&#150;1835), <span class="occ">founder of the Norwich Union insurance company</span>, was born in Westerham in Kent, the second of the eight surviving children of John Bignold (<i>c</i>.1734&#150;1795), a prosperous tenant farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Outram, also of Westerham. It is not known where he attended school, but he was sufficiently well educated to become an exciseman before moving to Norwich in the early 1780s. By 1785 he had married Sarah Long, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cocksedge (1752&#150;1821), and taken over the shop premises which Sarah's first husband had rented until his death in 1783 and which she had since managed as a widow. Between 1786 and 1793 they had three sons and three daughters. Bignold became a churchwarden and a freeman grocer, with an increasingly prosperous small business as a wine and hop dealer.<br>
<br>In 1792 Bignold also became the first secretary of Norwich General Assurance, a joint-stock fire insurance company backed by wealthy local merchants and manufacturers. Apart from his bookkeeping skills, he was probably chosen because he had avoided the bitter partisanship of Norwich politics and never became actively involved with either the local whigs and radicals or the tories. Indeed, he switched political allegiance to exploit business opportunities, having voted for the whigs until 1806, then converting to the tories in line with changes on the Norwich Union board. Meanwhile, in 1797 he had parted with a Norwich General board intent on controlling the scale of their risks, and had founded the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society with support from the city's extreme radicals, who were chiefly local shopkeepers. Norwich Union was a mutual institution, in which its policyholders shared in all profits. In return they also funded the society's risks with their premiums, which were retained for seven years to pay any losses before profits were redistributed as a septennial bonus.<br>
<br>Freed from influential local restraint and any need to raise capital, Bignold launched Norwich Union on a remarkable course of expansion. When his early directors objected in 1806, he ousted them by persuading local tory policyholders to back his ambitious attack on an insurance market dominated by London joint-stock companies which viewed provincial rivals as upstarts worthy only of a takeover. Bignold defied them by appointing some 500 agents across Britain over the next decade and introducing profit sharing to fire insurance on a far larger scale than any previous firm. The same agency network offered life insurance after he founded a mutual Norwich Union Life Insurance Society in 1808, threatening other rivals in a traditionally conservative business with tireless canvassing and press advertising to emphasize that fire insurance was cheaper with Norwich Union and that life policies were not only for the wealthy. Control remained within Bignold's family, with key posts for his three sons and two sons-in-law. He also persuaded prominent individuals throughout Britain to become trustees, which gave the largely unknown Norwich Union vital respectability.<br>
<br>By then, however, Bignold was well known for his eccentric behaviour when challenged. He had forced those Norwich Union directors who disagreed with him out of head office in 1806 by threatening them with a pair of pistols, which he later alleged were not loaded. On a later occasion, his truculent answers to the 1817 parliamentary select committee investigating misuse of extents in aid (crown writs to recover land) verged on open contempt. This trait continued with claimants. By 1818 Norwich Union had recruited 70,000 fire policyholders by applying the mutual principle on a massive and unprecedented scale. But claims had also increased after 1815 and were threatening bonuses during the post-war recession. Bignold could have retrenched, because Norwich Union still held sufficient reserves and agencies to sustain business after discontinuing bad risks. Most agents also took Norwich Union Life Society premium commissions and wanted to continue. But he had already overreacted, having moved to London in 1816 and resisted claims which he believed fraudulent with costly lawsuits. The &#145;moral risk&#146; of insurance was widely appreciated, and he justifiably doubted many claims made in difficult years. However, rivals were paying up quietly, while tightening up on underwriting. Bignold did neither, and legal costs rose while new business slumped. Rather than sink with their intransigent father, his sons backed Norwich Union's directors and took over. Norwich Union continued growing, itself a tribute to Bignold, who was informally offered reconciliation with a generous retirement income by his sons. Instead, he began further lawsuits to overturn his dismissal and also embarked on a bizarre range of businesses, including the manufacture and retail of shoes with revolving heels, which led in 1823 to his bankruptcy. He spent sixteen stubborn months in the king's bench prison before compromising with his third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45709/', "Sir Samuel Bignold")</script>, who secured his release and retirement in comfort to Westerham. Bignold died there on 11 August 1835 after prolonged ill health, which began six years earlier when he fell from a horse and broke his leg. He was buried at Old Catton church near Norwich, beside his wife, who had died in 1821.<br>
