<span class="headword">Jones,  Herbert</span> <span class="st"> [H]</span>  (1940&#150;1982), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Putney on 14 May 1940, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Jones, artist (1888&#150;1957), and his wife, Olwen Pritchard (1902&#150;1990), nurse. He was educated at St Peter's School, Seaford (1948&#150;53), and Eton College (1953&#150;8) before going to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, as an officer cadet in September 1958. In July 1960 he was commissioned into the Devon and Dorset regiment. On 20 June 1964 he married Sara de Upaugh (<i>b</i>. 1941), a secretary and later a magistrate. They had two sons: David (<i>b</i>. 1966) and Rupert (<i>b</i>. 1969). Since boyhood Jones had never wanted any career except the army and had developed an enthusiasm for all things military, including war gaming. He was also a keen sportsman with a passion for physical fitness. He rowed for Eton, sailed, skied, and enjoyed motor-racing while in the army.<br>
<br>After five years with the Devon and Dorset regiment Jones was seconded to the 3rd battalion, the Parachute regiment, where he commanded the mortar platoon. The next fourteen years saw the normal sequence of regimental or staff appointments&#151;adjutant of his battalion, junior staff officer at the headquarters of the UK land forces, a student at the Camberley Staff College, company commander, brigade major in Northern Ireland (which earned him an MBE), and instructor at the School of Infantry, Warminster. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in June 1979 he took up a senior staff post back at UK land forces and was appointed OBE for his part in planning the introduction of a peace-keeping force into Zimbabwe. In April 1981 he achieved his ultimate ambition when he was appointed commanding officer of the 2nd battalion, the Parachute regiment&#151;&#145;2 Para&#146;.<br>
<br>Jones, who disliked being called Herbert, preferring his nickname of H, moulded 2 Para into a formidable fighting unit with a zest for soldiering that mirrored his own. He was a fervent advocate of fitness and shooting, and was described as a person who did not recognize compromise. He was also an impatient man, quick to anger when thwarted. On exercises he was always to be found in front, often with the leading section, always pushing to keep things moving. On several such occasions, exercise umpires had ruled him &#145;dead&#146;. There is no doubt that the way he subsequently died was typical of the man.<br>
<br>When Britain decided to send an expeditionary force to retake the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic, which had been invaded by Argentina in 1982, Jones abandoned a skiing holiday to rush to the Ministry of Defence to persuade the authorities that 2 Para must go. He succeeded; his battalion became part of the 3rd commando brigade, an &eacute;lite formation under Brigadier Julian Thompson, Royal Marines. On 28 May 1982 Jones led 2 Para in an attack on the Argentinian position at Goose Green. It was the first land battle of the campaign, but one that Thompson had been ordered from London to carry out for political reasons&#151;against his professional advice. After a difficult 3000 metre night advance the battalion was held up in daylight by a strong enemy position on a ridge covering the settlement of Goose Green. Jones was concerned with the delay to A company, which was pinned down in a gorse gully. He went forward under fire to join them. For over an hour he tried to organize artillery and mortar fire support to get the attack moving, becoming increasingly frustrated when his efforts were unavailing. Finally, he stood up, yelled &#145;Follow me!&#146;, and dashed to his right up a re-entrant to try to get behind the enemy trenches. Unfortunately few heard his shout apart from his bodyguard, Sergeant Norman, who followed him round. Jones was shot from behind as he made a courageous solo charge on an enemy trench, dying soon afterwards. Within fifteen minutes the position was taken. For his gallantry and leadership Jones was awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
<br>Whether he was, at that moment, doing the job of a commanding officer is arguable, but there was no doubt as to the personal courage, disregard for danger, and forceful leadership that won Jones the Victoria Cross, which is kept in the National Army Museum, London. He is buried at Blue Beach military cemetery, Falkland Islands.<br>
