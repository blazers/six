</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward, Dame  (Lucy) Genevieve Teresa</span>  (1837&#150;1922), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, the only daughter of Samuel Ward, a diplomatist, and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leigh, was born in New York on 27 March 1837. She accompanied her parents in 1840 to Europe, where she later showed early promise as a singer and was introduced to Rossini, who arranged for her tuition in Florence. At the age of seventeen she met a Russian nobleman, Count Constantine de Guerbel, whom she married at a civil ceremony in Nice on 10 November 1855. Although this was to have been followed by a religious service in Paris, de Guerbel defaulted. Only after considerable diplomatic intervention was he compelled to meet his obligations at a ceremony in Warsaw. Ward and he separated immediately afterwards and she returned to Italy to resume her studies.<br>
<br>Ward began her operatic career as a soprano, at La Scala, Milan, under the stage name Madame Ginevra Guerrabella in 1857, playing in Donizetti's <span class="italic">Lucrezia Borgia</span>. After appearing in Italy and in Paris, where she performed as Elvira in Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> (Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Italiens, 1859), she and her mother travelled to England, where Ward began oratorio lessons and made herself known through a series of concerts. She was offered by the Pyne-Harrison Opera Company the role of Maid Marian in George Macfarren's <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, which opened at Covent Garden on 8 November 1861, and a further role in Vincent Wallace's <span class="italic">Maritana</span> (29 November 1861). With her appearance as Elvira in Bellini's <span class="italic">I puritani</span> at Her Majesty's Theatre on 10 May 1862, her future as an operatic singer seemed assured. She returned to New York and made her American d&eacute;but at the Academy of Music, performing Violetta in Verdi's <span class="italic">La traviata</span> (10 November 1862). A strenuous tour with an opera company in the south of the United States, however, followed by a season in Cuba, resulted in vocal strain which, with the complication of diphtheria, brought her operatic career to an end.<br>
<br>From 1862 to 1873 Ward recuperated and readjusted her sights on a dramatic career. She taught singing while herself taking lessons from Fanny Morant in New York. She saw Charlotte Cushman and corresponded with her during the latter's last years as a performer, while developing the basis of a future repertory of roles, including Lady Macbeth, Queen Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, Adrienne Lecouvreur, and Medea.<br>
<br>Ward left America having reassumed her maiden name, and with the recommendations of Lewis Wingfield and George Augustus Sala appeared in Manchester at the Theatre Royal as Lady Macbeth (1 October 1873). After touring to Dublin, she made her dramatic d&eacute;but in London at the Adelphi Theatre, as Alexina in <span class="italic">Elizabeth, or, The Exiles of Siberia</span>, but it was her dual roles as Blanche de Valois and Unarita at the same theatre in Benjamin Webster's <span class="italic">The Prayer in the Storm</span> that really attracted attention to her abilities: &#145;our stage has received a valuable addition&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 March 1874). Ward consolidated her position in the years up to 1878 by extensive tours in Ireland and Scotland, then returned to Manchester, where she played Queen Katharine in Charles Calvert's production of <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> and Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>. Quite consciously she positioned herself within a tradition which stretched back into the eighteenth century by assuming roles which had been identified with Mrs Siddons: Mrs Haller in Kotzebue's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span> and Belvidera in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, which Ward played at the Gaiety in 1876 on 18 March and 19 April respectively. During this period she also came into contact with Adelaide Ristori, whom she helped with her English version of Lady Macbeth. It initiated a friendship which lasted until Ristori's death in 1906 and a histrionic indebtedness which critics would increasingly notice.<br>
<br>In 1878 Ward revisited America for the first time as a dramatic actress, and opened in New York at Booth's Theatre (2 September 1878) in W. G. Wills's version of Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> admired her conception and technique but found her imagination wanting (3 September 1878). After performing her Shakespearian roles she returned to London in April 1879 and took over the management of the Lyceum during Irving's summer recess. Although she was less than successful in J. Palgrave Simpson and Claude Templar's <span class="italic">Zillah</span>, it was her performance as Stephanie de Mohrivart in Herman Merivale and F. C. Grove's <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> (21 August 1879) which brought her critical acclaim and a role which she would adopt as her own for the remainder of her career; she played it for the last time in September 1914.<br>
<br>The roles of the badly treated &#145;adventuress&#146; willing to challenge social and personal modes of conduct or the passionate woman who seeks retribution for past wrongs particularly attracted Ward, as her performances of Medea, Antigone, and Meg Merrilies in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> showed. She took <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> on her second visit to the United States in 1881&#150;2. William Winter saw her and, although he was troubled by the morality of the play and that of her character, her performance &#145;was an image of imperial will, made radiant with beauty and electric with flashes of passion&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Wallet of Time</span>, 2.410).<br>
<br>Ward returned to England in late 1882 and leased the Olympic Theatre for a season, which lasted from January to June 1883. She repeated her round of characters, adding to them the role of Sarah Churchill in Sydney Grundy's <span class="italic">The Queen's Favourite</span>, an adaptation of Scribe's <span class="italic">Le verre d'eau</span> (2 June 1883). Restless and adventurous by temperament, she gathered together a company, expanded her repertory again, and began a tour in December 1883 to include North America, Australia, and New Zealand which lasted until the beginning of 1887. Accompanied by W. H. Vernon as her leading man, she toured the east coast of Australia extensively from Brisbane to Adelaide, with lengthy stays in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as crossing to New Zealand, playing in <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span>, <span class="italic">The Queen's Favourite</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, <span class="italic">Lucrezia Borgia</span>, and another Grundy play adapted for her, <span class="italic">Rachel</span>. She left Australia on 1 December 1885 and returned to England in May 1886 via San Francisco and New York. This, however, was only a brief hiatus, as she continued her demanding tour of North America from September 1886 to April 1887. After opening in New York (24 September 1886) in <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span>, she and Vernon visited Ottawa and Montreal before embarking on a series of short engagements throughout the southern and Midwestern states of America, then Toronto, Hamilton, and London, Ontario.<br>
<br>The period after her return to England until 1891 was taken up with provincial tours with occasional appearances in London. Ward also began a career as an acting teacher in 1890. She was joined by Vernon, and continued to teach until his death in 1905. In 1889 Ward played Lona Hessel in Ibsen's <span class="italic">Pillars of Society</span> (Opera Comique, 17 July), the first of two attempts she made to come to terms with the &#145;new drama&#146;. On 25 November 1891, together with Vernon, she began a tour of South Africa, supported by a company under the management of Luscombe Searelle. She opened in Cape Town with <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> (10 December) before continuing on to Pretoria, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and East London. In addition to her established repertory, she added new plays: <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, <span class="italic">Othello</span>, J. P. Simpson's adaptation of Sardou's <span class="italic">Les pattes de mouche</span> called <span class="italic">A Scrap of Paper</span>, Boucicault's <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>, Oxenford's <span class="italic">The Two Orphans</span>, and J. B. Buckstone's comedy <span class="italic">Married Life</span>. Though Ward did not perform in all the plays, she and Vernon were responsible for their productions. She claimed to have mounted twenty-six plays in nine months before returning to England in October 1892.<br>
<br>Ward never again embarked on tours outside England, but continued her provincial touring virtually until her death. The period to 1899, however, was marked by her appearances for Irving at the Lyceum. She played Eleanor of Aquitaine in the original production of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Becket</span> (6 February 1893), her old role of Queen Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (10 July 1893), Morgan le Fay in Comyns Carr's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (12 January 1895), the Queen in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> (22 September 1896), and Margaret of Anjou in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, a role she continued to revive. Her second essay into Ibsen took place on 3 May 1897 under the auspices of the New Century Theatre, when she played Mrs Borkman in a production of <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span>, with Vernon as Borkman and Elizabeth Robins as Ella Rentheim. She found the experience a tedious one. &#145;The truth is, her tragic style, derived from Ristori, was not made for Ibsen&#146;, wrote Shaw  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 8 May 1897), although he had appreciated her performance in the earlier production.<br>
<br>During the remainder of her career Ward appeared infrequently on the London stage. She did, however, join F. R. Benson's company from time to time and added one last great role to her repertory when she played Volumnia in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> at the Comedy Theatre (13 February 1901). A. B. Walkley in <span class="italic">The Times</span> compared her performance directly with that of Sarah Siddons (14 February 1901). She repeated this on tours with Benson at Stratford and at the Old Vic. From that time Ward appeared occasionally at benefit concerts. Her last role in London was that of the duchess of Autevielle in L. N. Parker's <span class="italic">The Aristocrat</span> at the invitation of George Alexander (St James's Theatre, 25 January 1917): &#145;an aged <i>grande dame</i>, aged but not vulnerable, caustic of speech, regretting that she has outlived her sins&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Jan 1917). Ward was created a dame commander in the Order of the British Empire (27 March 1921) &#145;in recognition of the distinguished position which she has occupied for so long in her profession, and of the services rendered by her to dramatic art&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Aug 1922). She died on 18 August 1922 at 22 Avenue Road, London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on the 21st.<br>
<br>Genevieve Ward saw herself primarily as a tragic actress embodying a tradition which stretched back to Mrs Barry and Sarah Siddons. She was also much influenced in her style and choice of material by Fanny Kemble and Charlotte Cushman. Her cosmopolitan early life and her involvement with Italian opera also brought her into contact with European performers whose overt emotionalism she absorbed: she became particularly noted in roles which demanded violent emotional oscillations. Bram Stoker in his reminiscences of Irving remarked on the blazing eyes of &#145;a particularly <i>strong</i> actress, good at invective&#146;  (Stoker, 2.175). She was drawn towards resolute and individualistic female characters outside tragedy, ones which pitted her against ruthless men in a clash of wills. In this she was fortunate to secure an excellent foil in W. H. Vernon and in Sydney Grundy, who adapted and wrote plays to suit their partnership. Drawn to the &#145;new drama&#146; and its expansion of the thematic boundaries especially for women, she found herself repelled by Ibsen's suburban drabness and the fact that the plays offered no clear-cut dramatic intentions which audiences could understand  (Ward and Whiteing, 196&#150;202). Her indefatigable touring reflected both her interest in people and her understanding of the role of theatre as a cultural bond.<br>
