<span class="headword">Cathal mac Finguine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 742), <span class="occ">king of Munster</span>, was a member of the &Eacute;oganacht Glendamnach dynasty. Like his father, Finguine mac Con-cen-M&aacute;thair, and his son, Artr&iacute; mac Cathail, he was king of Munster, and he was the first to be involved in warfare against the dominant U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasties of the north of Ireland. Although he is of great significance on this account, his importance has been exaggerated by his reputation later in the middle ages. He was probably not the Cathal active in the midlands in 733, as claimed by some historians.<br>
<br>Cathal may have acceded to the kingship as early as 713, when Cormac mac Ailella, king of Munster, was killed. Although Etersc&eacute;l mac M&aacute;ele-Umai, also king of Munster, survived until 721, it seems that he had abdicated his office long before, probably even before the reign of Cormac mac Ailella. Therefore, when Murchad mac Brain, king of Leinster, led an army to Cashel (the seat of the kings of Munster) in 715, he may have been intending to subdue Cathal mac Finguine.<br>
<br>Six years later, Cathal's first appearance in the chronicles shows him devastating the plain of Brega in partnership with the same Murchad mac Brain. Brega was the homeland of the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill dynasty of S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine and included Tara, the symbolic seat of those who claimed supremacy over Ireland. It may be that Cathal was the junior partner in this enterprise, if a possibly interpolated annal entry can be relied upon, which says that Fergal mac M&aacute;ele-D&uacute;in, the high-king of Ireland, undertook a revenge raid later that year against the Leinstermen (not the Munstermen). The annals of Inisfallen have their own view of this episode: they indicate that Cathal acted alone in the devastation of Brega, and state that Fergal mac M&aacute;ele-D&uacute;in submitted to Cathal, and that Cathal became king of Ireland. However, the entry is eleventh century and seems to be an artificial promotion of a favoured historical character.<br>
<br>The following year, 722, the battle of Allen, north of Kildare, took place between Fergal mac M&aacute;ele-D&uacute;in and Murchad mac Brain. In a twelfth-century version of a story about this battle, Cathal mac Finguine is given an obviously contrived role: he was angered by the battle having occurred in his absence and the Leinstermen brought Fergal's head to him in the hope of placating him. Cathal returned the head to the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and appointed a new king for them.<br>
<br>The element of truth in this is that Cathal did not take part in the battle. Indeed, he does not reappear in the chronicles until 735, when, apparently in alliance with the Osraige and the D&eacute;isi, he was defeated in a battle against the Leinstermen (although the ever-favourable annals of Inisfallen and the tale of the battle of Allen claim that Cathal was victor). Two years later, he and &Aacute;ed All&aacute;n, the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill high-king of Ireland, held a meeting at Terryglass (Tipperary), approximately where Munster bordered the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill territories. The two kings seem to have discussed the dues of the Patrician churches, for that same year the chronicles say that &#145;The Law of Patrick was in force in Ireland&#146;. There may also have been an anti-Leinster pact, for the following year there was another major battle between the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill and Leinster, again without Cathal's involvement. It is possible that he later came to take hostages and treasures from the defeated king of Leinster, but the accounts of this are not consistent regarding the name of the king who submitted to Cathal, and the position and language of the entry give further grounds for reckoning it a late addition to the chronicles. The annals of Inisfallen do not report the incident, which may therefore be a misplaced and garbled version of Cathal's alleged victory over Leinster in 735.<br>
<br>Cathal was married to Caillech 
    (or Cellach; <i>d</i>. 732)
  , daughter of D&uacute;nchad of the U&iacute; Liath&aacute;in dynasty of Munster. He died in 742 and was buried in Emly (Tipperary).<br>
