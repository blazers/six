<span class="headword">Thackwell, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1781&#150;1859), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 1 February 1781 at Rye Court, Worcestershire, was the fourth son of John Thackwell JP (<i>d</i>. 1808), of Rye Court and Moreton Court, Worcestershire, and his wife, Judith, daughter of J. Daffy of Maysington, descended from the Egyoke family. Apparently educated mostly at Worcester, he was commissioned cornet in the Worcester provisional (later fencible) cavalry in June 1798, became lieutenant in September 1799, and served with it in Ireland until it was disbanded in April 1800. On 23 April 1800 he became cornet by purchase in the 15th light dragoons, and lieutenant, on 13 June 1801. After the peace of Amiens (March 1802) he was placed on half pay, but was brought back to the regiment on its augmentation in April 1804 prior to the resumption of war; he became captain on 9 April 1807. The 15th, converted to hussars in 1806, formed part of Lord Paget's hussar brigade in 1807, and was sent to the Peninsula in 1808, under Sir John Moore. It played the principal part in Paget's brilliant cavalry action at Sahagun (21 December 1808), helped cover the retreat to Corunna, and with the rest of the army was evacuated in January 1809. It then served in England, largely in support of the civil power. In April 1810 it served against Sir Francis Burdett's supporters, and escorted him to the Tower. In 1811 and 1812 it served against Luddites and other disaffected people in Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In January 1813 Thackwell embarked with the 15th for the Peninsula, landing at Lisbon in February. It formed part of the hussar brigade attached to Graham's corps and at the passage of the Esla, on 31 May, Thackwell commanded the leading squadron which surprised a French cavalry picket and took thirty prisoners. He took part in the battle of Vitoria (21 June 1813)&#151;when he was wounded in the right shoulder&#151;and in the subsequent pursuit, in the battle of the Pyrenees at the end of July, and in the blockade of Pamplona (October 1813). He was also present at Orthes, Tarbes, and Toulouse. On 1 March 1814, after passing the Adour, he was in command of the leading squadron of his regiment, and had a creditable encounter with the French light cavalry, for which he was recommended by Sir Stapleton Cotton, though in vain, for a brevet majority. He served with the 15th in the 1815 campaign. It was in Grant's brigade which was on the right of the line at Waterloo (18 June). Its share in the battle was described by Thackwell himself (see H. T. Sibthorne, <span class="italic">Waterloo Letters</span>, 1891). After several engagements with the French cavalry, it suffered severely in charging an infantry square towards the end of the day. Thackwell had two horses shot under him and was wounded in the left arm. He lay all night where he fell, was found next day and taken to hospital, and had his arm amputated close to the shoulder. He obtained his majority in the regiment on the day of Waterloo.<br>
<br>In 1816 the 15th returned to England and was stationed in the north, again serving in support of the civil power. In October 1816, at a riot in Birmingham, Thackwell was hit on the head by a stone or brickbat, and knocked unconscious for several hours. On 21 June 1817 he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel. On 16 August 1819 at St Peter's Field, Manchester (the Peterloo massacre), the 15th charged and dispersed the crowd. Thackwell succeeded to the command of the 15th on 15 June 1820. In October 1831 the 15th suppressed reform riots in Nottingham and its vicinity, and were thanked by the county magistrates. He was an efficient and humane commander, and in the 15th courts martial and floggings were rare. In November 1831 he arranged to exchange to half pay with Lord Brudenell, who reportedly paid between &pound;35,000 and &pound;40,000 for command of the 15th. After holding his command for twelve years, and having served thirty-two years in the regiment, Thackwell was placed on half pay on 16 March 1832. He was made KH in January 1834.<br>
<br>Thackwell married, on 29 July 1825, Maria Andriah (<i>d</i>. 21 June 1874), eldest daughter of Francis Roche of Rochemount, co. Cork (uncle of Lord Fermoy); they had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>On 10 January 1837 Thackwell became colonel in the army, and on 19 May he obtained, by exchange, command of the 3rd (King's Own) light dragoons. He went with it to India, reaching Calcutta in November 1837, but soon left it to command, with the local rank of major-general, the cavalry of the army of the Indus in the Afghan campaign of 1838&#150;9. He was present at the siege and capture of Ghazni, and he commanded the second column of that part of the army which returned to India from Kabul in the autumn of 1839. He was made CB in July 1838, and KCB on 20 December 1839. He commanded the cavalry division of Sir Hugh Gough's army in the short campaign against the Marathas of Gwalior at the end of 1843, and was mentioned in Gough's dispatch after the battle of Maharajpur. In the First Anglo-Sikh War he commanded the cavalry at Sobraon (10 February 1846), and led it in file over the entrenchments on the right, doing work (as Gough said) usually left to infantry and artillery. He was promoted major-general on 9 November 1846.<br>
<br>When the Second Anglo-Sikh War began Thackwell was appointed to command the 3rd division of infantry; but on the death of Brigadier Cureton in the action at Ramnagar on 22 November 1848 he was transferred to the cavalry division. After Ramnagar the Sikhs crossed to the right bank of the Chenab. To enable his own army to follow them Gough sent a force of about 8000 men under Thackwell to pass the river higher up, and help to dislodge the Sikhs from their position by moving on their left flank and rear. Thackwell found the nearer fords impracticable, but crossed at Wazirabad and on the morning of 3 December camped near Sadulapur. He had orders not to attack until he was joined by an additional brigade; but he was himself attacked towards midday by about half the Sikh army. The Sikhs drove the British pickets out of three villages and some large plantations of sugar cane, and so secured for themselves a strong position. Their artillery kept up a heavy fire until sunset, and they made some feeble attempts to turn the British flanks, but there was very little fighting at close quarters. In the course of the afternoon Thackwell received authority to attack if he thought proper; but as the enemy was strongly posted, he considered it safer to wait until next morning. By morning the Sikhs had disappeared, and it is doubtful whether they had any other object in their attack than that of gaining time for a retreat. Gough expressed his &#145;warm approval&#146; of Thackwell's conduct, but there were some signs of dissatisfaction in his dispatch of 5 December. An officer of fifty years' service is apt to be over-cautious. This was not the case with Gough himself, but Chilianwala (13 January 1849) went far to justify Thackwell. He commanded the cavalry at Chilianwala, but actually directed only the left brigade. At Gujrat (21 February 1849) he was also on the left, and kept in check the enemy's cavalry when it tried to turn that flank. After the battle was won he led a vigorous pursuit until nightfall. In his dispatch of 26 February 1849 Gough said: &#145;I am also greatly indebted to this tried and gallant officer for his valuable assistance and untiring exertions throughout the present and previous operations as second in command with this force&#146;. He received the thanks of parliament and, on Wellington's recommendation, the GCB (5 June 1849).<br>
<br>In November 1849 Thackwell was appointed colonel of the 16th lancers. In 1854, with war against Russia apparently imminent, Thackwell tried unsuccessfully to gain employment on active service with the cavalry. Instead he was temporary inspecting general of cavalry from April 1854 to February 1855, during the absence of the duke of Cambridge. On 20 June 1854 Thackwell was promoted lieutenant-general. In 1853 he bought Aghada Hall and estate, co. Cork, and he spent most of his last years shooting and improving his property. In early 1856 Lord Hardinge recommended him for a baronetcy but Palmerston refused, claiming it would create &#145;an inconvenient precedent&#146;  (Wylly, 356). He died on 8 April 1859 at Aghada Hall. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>All Thackwell's sons became army officers. His second son, Major-General William de Wilton Roche Thackwell (1834&#150;1910), commissioned in 1853, served in the Crimea and the 1882 Egyptian campaign. Thackwell's third son, <a name="cosubject_27157"></a><span class="headword">Osbert Dabit&ocirc;t Thackwell</span>  (1837&#150;1858), was commissioned ensign on 25 June 1855 and became lieutenant on 23 November 1856. He was lieutenant in the 15th Bengal native infantry when it mutinied at Nasirabad on 28 May 1857. He became interpreter to the 83rd foot, was in several engagements, and distinguished himself in the defence of Neemuch. He was at the siege of Lucknow and, after its capture, was killed in the street on 20 March 1858.<br>
<br>Thackwell's youngest son, Francis John Roche Thackwell, captain, Royal Irish Lancers, died in 1869 from wounds received from a tiger.<br>
