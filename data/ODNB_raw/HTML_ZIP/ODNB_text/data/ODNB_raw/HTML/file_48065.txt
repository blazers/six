<span class="headword">Mitchell,  John Thomas Whitehead</span>  (1828&#150;1895), <span class="occ">co-operative society administrator</span>, was born on 18 October 1828 in Rochdale, with no recognized father. His mother was a beerhouse keeper in Red Cross Street, where Mitchell attended the national school. His mother's forebears were in the hat trade, which became extinct in Rochdale during the early 1850s. His father was almost certainly a man by the name of Whitehead, alleged by Beatrice Webb to be &#145;a man in good position but of ungoverned character&#146;  (Webb, <span class="italic">My Apprenticeship</span>, 307). Although Mitchell's mother was poor, she kept him out of the factories for as long as she could, until he was ten or eleven, when he went to work as a piecer in Townshead mill for 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per week. However, he was sent to learn reading and writing at a Sunday school run by a clerk in the foundry.<br>
<br>One day in 1846 two men were canvassing the streets round Hope Street in Rochdale for Providence Chapel Sunday school. In the Mitchell house they found the boy reading and his mother making the dinner. &#145;They seemed to live on the most affectionate terms&#146;  (Maxwell, 395). They asked John to join, and secured his mother's agreement. The next Sunday, one of the men, Mr Pagan, a flannel weaver (and later twice mayor of Rochdale), called for Mitchell and enrolled him in his own class. This led Mitchell to accept radical and puritan ideals and to sign the pledge. This must have been a big decision, as it meant breaking with his mother's only visible means of support.<br>
<br>Mitchell subsequently used the library at Providence Sunday school, and joined its juvenile temperance society, which led him into the Rochdale Temperance Society, of which he became a committee member. He also became a member of the local Rechabite Tent which became the &#145;love and truth&#146; division of the Sons of Temperance. He remained a member and an official until he died. The subcommittee of the temperance society held meetings in Mitchell's room at the top of his mother's house.<br>
<br>Then, about 1850, Mitchell personally experienced secession, a characteristic event in the associational culture of the day. There was disagreement at Providence about the appointment of a new pastor. A number of members split to form the New Milton Congregational Church in Bailie Street. Mitchell went with them. By 1854 he was a Milton Sunday school teacher. Mr Pagan did more than recruit and teach his young clients. He offered Mitchell a situation in the warehouse at 16<i>s</i>. a week. The firm changed hands several times. Mitchell stayed for eighteen years until 1867, and was promoted from wool sorter to manager of the wool department. By June 1871 he was a &#145;manufacturer&#146;, having set himself up in trade as a flannel dealer. He did this on his own account for some years until he gradually let it go, as his work in the co-operative movement became too demanding.<br>
<br>Mitchell was clearly a man who longed for organizational work and the chance to do business. This was his lifetime affair. His contacts in the flannel trade later led to his appointment as liquidator of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Productive Society, a co-operative concern at Littleborough which hit bad times. From 1878 until the end of his life he nursed that company round, incurring attacks on his probity partly as a result. No one else had hope for the society. But for much of his working life Mitchell worked every day between 7.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. to try to make it viable. Finally he managed to free it from creditors and prepare it for take-over by the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Meanwhile, Mitchell had established a London agency to run his own business, getting cotton goods made by the Rochdale Manufacturing Society dyed and finished at Middleton which he then sold through his agency. He used his home as a warehouse, adding an adjoining cottage as the business grew.<br>
<br>Mitchell joined the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers' Society in 1853, and in 1856 became a member of its committee [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60696/', "Rochdale Pioneers")</script>]. About 1857 he moved in with Abraham Howard, and they remained close friends. Mitchell's other very close friend was Thomas Butterworth (their deaths occurring within a few days of each other). At one time Butterworth had been in disgrace in Rochdale, imprisoned for stealing from a co-op. When he was released about 1872, Mitchell held out his hand in friendship. They became inseparable.<br>
<br>It was through the Rochdale Pioneers that Mitchell was elected to the board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in 1869 and, in June 1874, became its chairman. This was the most important step in his life. It was an immensely demanding and influential post; and Mitchell remained chairman until his death. He nevertheless remained as a Sunday school teacher at Milton School, always returning from national or international meetings on every possible Sunday. Apart from his secretaryship to the government-financed science and art classes for many years in Rochdale and running for office as a radical Liberal in local election campaigns in Rochdale in 1893 and 1894, it was to the co-operative movement that he devoted his formidable energies. Beatrice Webb saw him as a business genius. In her <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, she described him as &#145;corpulent&#146; with a &#145;shiny bald head, clean shaven face, exhibiting a full, good-tempered mouth, largely developed jaw and determined chin&#146;  (Webb, <span class="italic">My Apprenticeship</span>, 315). Webb received considerable help from Mitchell with her book about the co-operative movement. Published in 1891, this &#145;revealed a sympathy with Mitchell's view of the role of the CWS in industrial production&#146;  (Bellamy and Saville, 242).<br>
<br>By the late 1880s the annual turnover of the CWS exceeded &pound;6 million, its warehouse at Manchester was a small town, and it was administering nearly &pound;1 million of funds in shares, loan capital, and reserve. By the late 1890s there were 8407 people employed by the society, working in the distributive departments and in the bank as well as in the productive works and services. It remains an extraordinary fact about Mitchell, however, that as chairman of what Beatrice Webb saw as &#145;the most varied if not the largest business enterprise in the world at that time&#146;  (Webb, <span class="italic">My Apprenticeship</span>, 307), he received only something like &pound;150 a year in fees&#151;and this at a time when (to use a Mitchell phrase) in &#145;the Barnum wickedness of the competitive world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, 11 Dec 1880) conspicuous consumption by capitalists on the one hand, and self-regarding professional managers as a separate social group on the other, were busy establishing themselves. &#145;Perhaps no man in Europe presided over so large a business, and certainly no man ever presided over so vast a concern who took such slender remuneration for so doing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rochdale Observer</span>, 3 April 1895).<br>
<br>For Mitchell, means were united with ends through the movement, with all its constitutional inventions and disciplines. If, like idealistic Christian socialists, despising the store, you did not take the movement seriously, the movement as a way of life rather than as an idea, and as a real life association of large numbers of disagreeing, and sometimes disagreeable, working people, then you did not take Mitchell seriously. Mitchell's strong views were at the heart of a strategic argument about co-operative production which took place within the movement during his lifetime. The Christian socialists, on one side, advocated self-governing workshops (with bonus to labour, profit sharing, and other such measures), while the CWS, on the other, held that all production should be carried on in large-scale factories governed by the CWS general committee, with the CWS itself being owned and controlled as a federation of local retail co-operative societies. In the CWS system, advocated by Mitchell, the benefits of co-operation were to be realized by the worker as member (along with all other members) rather than by the worker as producer in his own, self-governing workshop. This was a serious debate, both sides of which are still relevant to anyone interested in the connections which complex co-operation in an era of large-scale industry requires.<br>
<br>Concentration of trade in a single channel was Mitchell's dream and that of the CWS:<blockquote>My desire is that the profits of all trade, all industry, all distribution, all commerce, all importation, all banking and money dealing, should fall back again into the hands of the whole people. If co-operators will manage their enterprises in such a way as to concentrate all their trade in one channel, I am certain that this can be accomplished. (Redfern, &#145;The Mitchell centenary&#146;, 15&#150;16)</blockquote>Sharing a platform with Tom Mann in Bristol in 1893, Mitchell expressed his vision thus:<blockquote>we want to put the profits of trade into the pockets of the people, not a section of them, but the entire community. Until the people get hold of trade profits they will never be able to undertake the productive business of the world. Mr Carnegie of America said that &pound;1,000 in the hands of one person would do more good to the community than 1,000 persons owning &pound;1 apiece. That was absolutely untrue. It would be better still if the seven hundred million pounds of the British Debt were owned by the forty millions of British people, than to belong to a small section of the community. Co-operators want to use the best means to get the entire wealth of this country, land and everything else, into the possession of the entire body politic. (Co-operative Congress, 132)</blockquote>The difference between this form of late nineteenth-century Owenism, with strong early nineteenth-century plebeian-radical connections and earlier forms of communitarianism, is that it was practical rather than rhetorical and led to very large-scale voluntary association among people arranging the means of life for themselves, rather than to demands for political concessions from Britain's government. In party political terms, it was non-political.<br>
<br>Mitchell believed in singular, complete solutions to society's problems. He was wary of theory and theorists. In terms of conventional nineteenth-century political categories, he was a radical or an advanced Liberal. He very occasionally referred to himself as a &#145;collectivist&#146;, but this was not a label he favoured and in 1894 he qualified the remark, adding but &#145;not by Act of Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, 20 Oct 1894). Strongly anti-individualist, even anti-individual, Mitchell espoused only an individuality for the good of all. To use an early nineteenth-century word with which he was familiar, he was an associationist. &#145;Co-operation ought to be based on the principle of united interest with the societies and not individuals. Some persons thought that individuals should be the basis&#146;  (Haslam, 76). Mitchell's main belief was in association, with very large numbers of working people choosing to do their own business instead of allowing other people to do it for them.<br>
<br>Mitchell died at his home, 15 John Street, Rochdale, on 16 March 1895 from chronic bronchitis and pneumonia. He left effects worth only &pound;350 and his bedroom was described as humble in the extreme. It contained reports and balance sheets, portraits of a few friends, his <span class="roman">Bible</span> and hymnbook, and that was all. He was buried on 20 March in Rochdale cemetery. The CWS erected a granite monument there in his memory, engraved with a key sentence from his presidential address at the 1892 Co-operative Congress:<blockquote>The three great forces for the improvement of mankind are religion, temperance and co-operation; and, as a commercial force, supported and sustained by the other two, co-operation is the greatest, noblest and most likely to be successful in the redemption of the industrial classes. (Bellamy and Saville, 242)</blockquote>
