<span class="headword">Paulinus</span> <span class="st"> [St Paulinus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 644), <span class="occ">bishop of York and of Rochester</span>, was almost certainly an Italian by birth. He was one of the Roman monks sent by Pope Gregory the Great (<i>r</i>. 590&#150;604) to England in 601 to support Augustine's mission [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93690', "Gregorian mission")</script>]. Gregory provided the party with a series of commendatory letters to the Frankish kings Theuderic II of Burgundy and Theudebert II of Austrasia, to their powerful grandmother Brunechildis, to King Chlothar II of Neustria, and to a number of Frankish bishops. From these, it can be deduced that the monks travelled, with possible diversions, through Toulon, Marseilles, Arles, Gap, Vienne, Lyons, Ch&acirc;lon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, Metz, Paris, and Angers. Reaching Kent by 604, they brought letters from Gregory to Augustine, to King &AElig;thelberht, and to his wife, Bertha, together with ecclesiastical furniture, relics, and many books. In his letter to Augustine, Gregory expressed his desire that metropolitan sees be established at London and York.<h2>
<a name="MissiontoNorthumbria"></a>Mission to Northumbria</h2>Paulinus's activities in the mission are entirely obscure until he was called upon to accompany to Northumbria &AElig;thelburh, the sister of King Eadbald of Kent and daughter of King &AElig;thelberht, following her betrothal to the Northumbrian king Eadwine. Bede, whose <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span> is the principal source for Paulinus's life, reports that Eadwine had promised to allow &AElig;thelburh and her party the freedom to practise Christian worship. Paulinus, who must by this time have become a fluent speaker of English, was sent with &AElig;thelburh to ensure that she and her companions &#145;were not polluted by contact with the heathen&#146;, whom, in addition, he earnestly desired to convert to Christianity  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.9). Before they left Kent, Paulinus was consecrated bishop by Justus, archbishop of Canterbury, an event which Bede dates to 21 July 625. This date is very likely to be accurate: the argument that it is six or seven years too late because Bede made mistakes in his calculation of seventh-century dates is inconclusive at best.<br>
<br>Conversion of the Northumbrians had to begin with their king, but winning Eadwine wholeheartedly round to a new faith was not straightforward. Bede drew on three stories of Eadwine's conversion, probably derived from Canterbury and perhaps ultimately from Paulinus himself, which he linked together into a continuous narrative. In the first episode, which he dates to Easter 626, Bede tells how an attempt to assassinate the king, inspired by the West Saxons, was foiled, and, on the same night, &AElig;thelburh gave birth to a daughter, Eanfl&aelig;d. When Paulinus claimed that God had granted the child in response to his prayers, Eadwine promised that he would convert to Christianity, provided that God granted him victory over those who had tried to assassinate him; as a pledge of his word, he gave Eanfl&aelig;d to Paulinus to be consecrated to Christ. She and eleven other members of Eadwine's household were the first Northumbrians to be baptized, at Pentecost 626.<br>
<br>Although, in due course, Eadwine was victorious over his West Saxon enemies, he would not accept Christianity &#145;at once and without consideration&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.9). He no longer worshipped idols, sought to learn the faith systematically from Paulinus, and he and &AElig;thelburh received exhortatory letters from Pope Boniface V (<i>r</i>. 619&#150;25). But Eadwine still found it necessary &#145;to consult with the counsellors whom he considered the wisest&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.9). Bede relates that, during these deliberations, Paulinus came to the king and, inspired by God, placed his right hand on the king's head, and asked him if he recognized this sign. Paulinus thus referred to a vision that Eadwine had had before he became king, when he was in exile at the court of R&aelig;dwald, king of the East Angles. Then, at a moment when R&aelig;dwald was considering handing him over to his Northumbrian enemies, Eadwine had encountered a stranger who knew his difficulty and offered him deliverance from his enemies, a kingship of unsurpassed power, and counsel as to his salvation, in return for a promise of obedience, to be claimed in the future by the laying of a hand on his head. As Bede tells the story, the stranger was a &#145;spirit&#146;, but the anonymous Whitby life of Pope Gregory the Great (written between 680 and 704) identifies him as Paulinus, although there is no independent evidence for Paulinus's having been active in East Anglia.<br>
<br>In reality, Paulinus, even in the guise of a divinely inspired agent, may have had less influence on Eadwine's decision than the attitude of the Northumbian aristocracy. While Eadwine declared to Paulinus his personal willingness to accept Christianity, Bede depicts, in a vivid tableau, a meeting of the Northumbrian council in the king's hall. Paulinus was asked to speak there, his task of promoting Christianity doubtless made easier by the immediate and frank admission of the pagan high priest, Coifi, that &#145;the religion which we have hitherto held has no virtue nor profit in it&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.13), and by another counsellor's characterization of the ephemerality of earthly life. Paulinus's words were sufficient to persuade the high priest to convert to Christianity, and Eadwine skilfully led him to offer to destroy his own idols.<h2>
<a name="BishopatYork"></a>Bishop at York</h2>On Easter day, 12 April, 627, Eadwine was baptized at York in a hastily constructed church dedicated to St Peter, &#145;with all the nobles of his race and a vast number of the common people&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.14). Paulinus's see was established at York and Eadwine set about building a stone church there, of which no trace has yet been discovered. A British tradition extant in the early ninth-century <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> claims that Eadwine was baptized by Rhun, son of Urien. This statement is hard to accept as it stands, but if Rhun's father was Urien, king of Rheged (<i>fl</i>. 560&#150;580), then his presence at Eadwine's court is at least chronologically plausible: the tradition may preserve the memory of preparatory British efforts at conversion in Northumbria.<br>
<br>For Bede, Northumbria owed its conversion chiefly to Paulinus. He recounts the numerous baptisms that the bishop performed, including Eadwine's sons from an earlier liaison, Osfrith and Eadfrith, one of Osfrith's sons, the children of Eadwine and &AElig;thelburh, and &#145;not a few others of noble and royal stock&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.14). At the royal palace at Yeavering, in the northern Northumbrian kingdom of Bernicia, Paulinus spent thirty-six days instructing converts and baptizing them in the River Glen. In the southern kingdom of Deira he baptized in the Swale, near Catterick. He also built a church in the royal vill at &#145;Campodunum&#146; (possibly near Dewsbury, Yorkshire) which, however, afterwards burnt down. On one occasion he is said to have responded to a crow's ill-omened croaking by having the bird shot, and then using its death as an illustration of the futility of paganism.<br>
<br>Paulinus also preached in Eadwine's satellite kingdom of Lindsey. His first convert there, according to Bede, was the <i>praefectus</i> of Lincoln, a certain Bl&aelig;cca. It was presumably through his influence that Paulinus was able to build a stone church in the city, the walls of which were still standing in Bede's day, which has been tentatively identified with the earliest phase of the church of St Paul in the Bail. Here Paulinus's status in the English mission reached its apogee. Some time between 628 and 631, as the only Roman bishop in England, he consecrated Honorius as archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Archbishop Justus.<h2>
<a name="FlighttoKent"></a>Flight to Kent</h2>The Northumbrian mission came to an abrupt halt with the death of Eadwine at the battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633. His realm disintegrated into its constituent parts, Deira and Bernicia, and there seems to have been a pagan reaction against the Christianity that Eadwine had promoted. For Paulinus and &AElig;thelburh, Bede declares, &#145;there seemed no safety except in flight&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.20). They set sail for Kent in the charge of one of Eadwine's loyal retainers, Bass, and together with Eanfl&aelig;d, Eadwine and &AElig;thelburh's son Uscfrea, and Eadwine's grandson Yffi. The two boys were sent for protection to King Dagobert I in Francia. Bede has a reliable report from Canterbury that the golden cross and chalice that Paulinus had brought with him were still preserved in Kent in his own day. At the invitation of Archbishop Honorius and King Eadbald, Paulinus took charge of the see of Rochester, whose previous bishop, Romanus, had died at least six years earlier. It was probably here that he received the pallium that Pope Honorius (<i>r</i>. 625&#150;38), not then having heard of Eadwine's death, had sent, along with a letter to the king.<h2>
<a name="Paulinussinfluenceandappearance"></a>Paulinus's influence and appearance</h2>Although Bede, concerned to emphasize the role of the Augustinian mission in bringing the new faith to northern England, put a positive gloss on Paulinus's activities, it seems unlikely that Christianity struck deep roots in Northumbria during his episcopate. Its fragility is adequately attested by the pagan reaction on Eadwine's death. Although his immediate successors, Osric in Deira and Eanfrith in Bernicia, had been converted (the former by Paulinus, the latter in Ireland), both soon apostacized. Nevertheless, Paulinus did convert Hild, the future abbess of Whitby, and one of his companions, a deacon named James, remained behind in the church at York. James provided some continuity with the period in which Christianity truly flowered in Northumbria, from the time of King Oswald (<i>d</i>. 642), for he lived into Bede's own lifetime, teaching church music at York &#145;after the manner of Rome and the Kentish people&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.20).<br>
<br>Bede's description of Paulinus's appearance, though it includes topoi from other sources, may contain some authentic elements. It was relayed to him by Deda, abbot of Partney, from an account of baptisms that Paulinus had performed at Littleborough (in modern Nottinghamshire) in the presence of Eadwine. The bishop &#145;was tall, with a slight stoop, black hair, a thin face, a slender aquiline nose, and at the same time he was both venerable and awe-inspiring in appearance&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 2.16).<h2>
<a name="Deathandsainthood"></a>Death and sainthood</h2>Paulinus died on 10 October 644, his feast, under which day his name appears in pre-conquest calendars. His soul was reported to have been seen ascending to heaven &#145;in the form of an exceedingly beautiful great white bird, like a swan&#146;  (Colgrave, 101). He was buried in the sanctuary of the cathedral church of St Andrew in Rochester, where he was succeeded by a Kentishman, Ithamar. His body was translated into a silver shrine by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury when the church was rebuilt in the 1080s.<br>
