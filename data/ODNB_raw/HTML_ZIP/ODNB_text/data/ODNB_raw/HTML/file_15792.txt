<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knox,  Vicesimus</span>  (1752&#150;1821), <span class="occ">headmaster and writer</span>, was born on 8 December 1752 at Newington Green, Middlesex, the only son of the Revd Vicesimus Knox (1729&#150;1780), a clergyman and schoolteacher, and Ann, daughter of Devereux Wall. From 1764 the younger Knox, who signed himself first Nock and then Knock until the age of twenty, was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, where his father was a master. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 13 July 1771 and in the following year his father was appointed headmaster at Tonbridge School, Kent, so beginning an association which lasted over seventy years and involved three generations of the Knox family. The younger Vicesimus graduated BA in 1775 and became a fellow of St John's. He looked back fondly on his time at Oxford, recalling in a later essay &#145;the blissful region of the common room fire-side! Delightful retreat where never female showed her head&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 2nd edn, 1779, 1.325). Regardless of these views, Knox, who later became an active proponent of women's education, left St John's in 1778 to replace his father as headmaster at Tonbridge where he remained for the next thirty-four years. Here he met his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of a local man, Thomas Miller; they married on 26 December 1778 at St James's, Westminster. The couple had a daughter, Sarah, and three sons, one of whom, Holles Josiah, died in infancy; of their surviving sons Vicesimus (<i>d</i>. 1855) became a barrister and recorder of Saffron Walden while Thomas (1784&#150;1843) succeeded his father at Tonbridge in 1812. Ordained in the late 1770s, Knox combined his teaching duties with those of rector of Runwell and Ramsden-Crays, Essex, and, at Lord Vane's bequest, minister of the parochial chapelry of Shipborne, Kent.<h2>
<a name="Teacherandeducationist"></a>Teacher and educationist</h2>Tonbridge School, governed by the Skinners' Company since its foundation by Sir Andrew Judde in 1553, had not prospered under the headship of the elder Vicesimus Knox. In his six years as headmaster the number of pupils recorded in the school lists averaged just over twenty, the lowest of the century, and chronic ill health forced his resignation in 1778; he died two years later. By contrast, the arrival of the 26-year-old Vicesimus Knox the younger galvanized the school and pupil numbers soon topped eighty, the majority of whom were boarders. With his income swelled by the fees from the boarding pupils, Knox was able to live in fine style. One pupil, Henry Woodgate, writing to his father in 1781, described how the school's fortunes had changed: &#145;Mr Knox of Tunbridge has a new coach just come out spick and span with a pair of long-tail greys. Is not this quite the thing? My aunt says &#147;Lor' sir, a schoolmaster's is a vastly fine trade&#148;&#146;  (G. Woodgate and G. C. G. Woodgate, <span class="italic">A History of the Woodgates</span>, 1910, 247). Knox's initial success at Tonbridge was principally due to the high reputation as a scholar that he had acquired at Oxford and to the popularity of his first work, <span class="italic">Essays Moral and Literary</span> (1778), whose authorship quickly became known. Three years later he further publicized the school by publishing <span class="italic">Liberal Education, or, A Practical Treatise on the Method of Acquiring Useful and Polite Learning</span> (1781), which effectively was both a manifesto and a prospectus. Eagerly purchased by the public, <span class="italic">Liberal Education</span> successfully targeted two influential audiences, for it proved indispensable as a professional handbook for fellow schoolmasters and an invaluable guide for parents who were debating how and where to educate their children. Above all, it fulfilled Knox's principal aim of providing a practical, rather than theoretical, treatise on education.<br>
<br>In the introduction to the study Knox defined his ideal of an enlightened education in comparison with a purely functional schooling, the one<blockquote>confined, the other enlarged; one which only tends to qualify for a particular sphere of action, for a profession, or an official employment; the other which endeavours to improve the powers of understanding for their own sake; the sake of exalting the endowments of human nature, and becoming capable of sublime and refined contemplation. (<span class="italic">Liberal Education</span>, 8&#150;9)</blockquote>Conscious of the competition from private tutors and commercial schools and the criticism of educational and moral standards at contemporary grammar schools, Knox grounded his argument in favour of a public (that is, school-based) rather than private (home-based) education for boys on the assumption that grammar schools had reformed themselves into ideal educational institutions, such as Tonbridge. While maintaining that Greek and Latin were indispensable in a liberal education, he was adamant that the curriculum should include English, French, history, and geography, and ornamental accomplishments such as music, art, and fencing. &#145;English biography&#146; he particularly recommended as &#145;more entertaining, and perhaps more useful, than civil history at large&#146;; furthermore he called for a &#145;biographical work&#146; to be compiled for the use of schools, one that should be &#145;elegantly written, and consist principally, but by no means entirely, of the lives of the learned&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1824, 4.45). He also discussed extra-curricular activities, such as private study and foreign travel, and did not neglect to outline his views on the need for reform in the universities. He set out his opinion on female education in two chapters. Although he advised parents to educate their daughters at home, he insisted that the content of their education should not be limited by its domestic setting. In recommending an expansive literary education for girls he asserted that the female &#145;mind is certainly as capable of improvement, as that of the other sex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liberal Education</span>, 235&#150;6). Furthermore it was essential for women to be liberally and rationally educated since, as mothers, they were responsible for the pre-school instruction of their sons. Knox used his experience as a schoolmaster to underline his point:<blockquote>A sensible and well-educated mother is, in every respect, best qualified to instruct a child till he can read well enough to enter on the Latin grammar. I have indeed always found those boys the best readers, on their entrance on Latin, who have been prepared by a careful and accomplished mother. (ibid., 17)</blockquote>Evidence of how far Knox put into practice at Tonbridge the educational principles outlined in <span class="italic">Liberal Education</span> is limited. The dominance of the classics is clearly seen in a surviving curriculum from 1781 which records that boys studied the Latin <span class="roman">Testament</span> in the first form and graduated to Homer and Livy in the sixth; the head boy of the time, J. H. Stewart, clearly outstripped his classmates, for his studies include Hebrew and Demosthenes. On Skinners' day, the annual celebration in May of the school's founder, Knox encouraged the boys to show off their debating and oratorical skills. Moreover the pupils were examined by visiting clergy from London. Clearly Tonbridge fulfilled parents' expectations, for the school roll remained steady until the early 1790s, when pupils fell away, reaching a low of twenty-six in 1794. Knox's controversial politics, which were broadcast when <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported his involvement in a fracas in the Brighton theatre in August 1793, are usually blamed for the school's failing fortunes. However, during the turbulent years of the war with France he neither resigned nor was asked to leave by the school's governors, and by the time he retired in 1812, forty-one pupils were enrolled.<h2>
<a name="Writeronconduct"></a>Writer on conduct</h2>Running parallel with Knox's work as an educationist was his considerable career as a writer on conduct, especially that of children and young adults. Certainly the majority who knew Knox as an educator discovered him through his numerous, much reprinted, and ever-expanding collections of essays and sermons. Writing and teaching ran in tandem. In the year of his appointment at Tonbridge his <span class="italic">Essays Moral and Literary</span> were published on the recommendation of Samuel Johnson. In the preface to the first, anonymous edition, Knox established his didactic intentions which, as in his later work, he grounded in a practical relationship between writing, education, and personal and societal development: &#145;to publish without improving&#146; was, he believed, equivalent &#145;to increasing the weight without adding to the value of the coin&#146;, the &#145;real utility of literary labours&#146; being &#145;the extent of their influence on the national manners&#146; (<span class="italic">Essays</span>, 1778, iv; 1779, 2.5). To this purpose Knox's first edition of thirty-eight essays combined traditional studies on classical literature, philosophy, and the arts with commentaries on contemporary standards of taste, and the work of modern authors such as Joseph Addison. Knox's insights proved popular and a second larger, and attributed, edition appeared a year later; by 1815 the collection, now in three volumes and numbering 174 essays, reached its seventeenth edition. In these later editions Knox addressed an increasingly diverse range of subjects, among them gardening, household management, the work of Bede, the usefulness of capital letters in correspondence, and the unacceptability of masculine dress for women. The spirit of improvement implicit in these pieces was expressed more directly in numerous articles on the achievement and practice of good conduct within a series of military, civilian, religious, commercial, and mercantile contexts.<br>
<br>From such studies there developed a Knoxian behavioural ideal&#151;stable, moderate, integrous, and independent&#151;which became a staple of his writing in this and other fields and the desired end point for these general exercises in national education. To an extent this archetype was a restatement of a much discussed (and many feared lost) eighteenth-century civic ideal. Yet it is equally true that his depiction of the moral personality was also more innovative, optimistic, and receptive to then fashionable late-century behavioural codes such as sensibility. Though an energetic and, to modern readers, often relentless moralist, Knox was invariably more persuasive than puritanical, being more accommodating of recent social and economic trends than many later critics, too keen to identify him as a conservative, have been prepared to acknowledge. No doubt it was this receptiveness which contributed to the popularity of his advice. Thus Knox's ostensibly stoical ideal is better characterized by an attachment to a modern sensibility manifest in intimate social relations, acts of philanthropy, and displays of emotional compassion by men and women alike. For Knox it was principally via these qualities, rather than those of classical hardiness, that the goal of personal and national improvement was to be achieved.<br>
<br>It was an attachment which, alongside better-known contemporaries such as Henry Mackenzie and Hannah More, also makes Knox an important contributor to the late eighteenth-century debate on the meaning and application of sensibility, not least because of his unusual readiness to direct these ideals to the cause of political reform. Highly protective of sensibility in its purest and most edifying form, he was also highly critical of what he considered its abuse through affectation, triviality, and ostentatiousness (subjects which exercised him greatly), and in particular the growing fashion for irresponsible modern novels. His concern over aspects of contemporary fiction focused on its popularity among the same middle-class readership to whom he energetically promoted his alternative characterization of the morally robust and civically responsible man and woman of feeling. Ever the educator, Knox was motivated to communicate in an accessible manner which he believed best served by the essay format, about which he wrote and which he also employed in a second collection on conduct, <span class="italic">Winter Evenings, or, Lucubrations on Life and Letters</span> (1788), and an anthology of &#145;polite&#146; eighteenth-century sermons, <span class="italic">Family Lectures, or, Domestic Divinity</span> (1791). His own series, <span class="italic">Sermons; Chiefly Intended to Promote Faith, Hope and Charity</span>, appeared in the following year. Here, as in his earlier works, Knox complemented the accessibility of the essay or sermon format with a self-consciously unpretentious style. The result, as he seldom tired of repeating, was an honest and unsensational message directed not &#145;to deep, erudite, and subtile sages&#146; but to &#145;the liberal merchant, the inquisitive manufacturer, the country gentleman [and] the various persons who fill the most useful departments in life&#146; who &#145;have no objection to kill a little time, by perusing &hellip; the pages of a modern volume&#146;  (<span class="italic">Winter Evenings</span>, 1.v). Indeed, so frequent were these claims that it is hard not to see them as his attempt to cast as affected and haughty those who questioned the value of another set of homilies. Others suspected a more underhand motive for his apparently disingenuous approach. In the introduction of his <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, for example, Knox offered the now familiar denial of intended offence or controversy, though he stated that he was resigned to condemnation from less generous unitarian commentators sceptical of his commitment to the Trinity. Yet to critics like John Disney, minister at London's Essex Street Unitarian chapel, Knox's declaration presented an unduly severe characterization of unitarianism, by which he abused his reputation as a polite moralist in order to precipitate the very contest he claimed to avoid through &#145;responsible&#146; ecumenicalism.<h2>
<a name="Religionpoliticsandliterature"></a>Religion, politics, and literature</h2>The content and tone of Knox's theology, like that of his conduct advice, was predominantly reassuring and nurturing. Religion's purpose was &#145;to afford the poor human nature a BALSAM FOR THE WOUNDS OF THE HEART&#146;, and its achievement the socialization of man to a level where, <i>pace</i> unitarians, it became impossible to maintain factionalism in a society dedicated to shared Christian virtues. In contrast to earlier secular writers on social performance, Knox understood refinement and religion to be intimately connected. The personal qualities that ensured the truly civilized individual&#151;benevolence, sincerity, and humility&#151;were also those of the Christian, and their display further enhanced the religious individual's capacity for a morally valid sociability. The importance Knox attributed to sensibility as a route to true sociability led him to identify sentimental culture as central to a wider religious vision as set out in subsequent collections, including his <span class="italic">Christian Philosophy, or, An Attempt to Display the Evidence and Excellence of Revealed Religion</span>, published in 1795. Social and religious ideals came together in the sensitive and compassionate figure of the weeping Christ.<br>
<br>Though keen to avoid controversy, Knox was committed to an essentially benign religious vision which prompted him to speak out on contentious issues, notably British involvement in military action against revolutionary France. In August 1793 he preached at Brighton parish church against a war which he believed driven by a &#145;military machine&#146; serviced by a corrupt and misguided administration. Knox's call for &#145;universal peace&#146; offended members of the Sussex regiment who were present and who confronted him and secured his ejection from the town's theatre several days later. Knox responded in November with a <span class="italic">Narrative of Transactions Relative to a Sermon</span>, in which he denounced the cowardice of his assailants and reiterated his belief of &#145;offensive war&#146; as &#145;at once detestable, deplorable and ridiculous&#146;  (p. 96). His translation of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Antipolemus, or, The Plea of Reason, Religion and Humanity Against War</span>, appeared in the following year.<br>
<br>For Knox, Britain's readiness to fight was evidence of its corruption and of the prevailing &#145;spirit of despotism&#146;, a phrase which served as the title of his most polemical and best-known study in political science. The study, which defended the early revolution and its British supporters like Charles James Fox, was published in London in 1795. However, with the French government becoming increasingly tyrannous, Knox soon after attempted to recall the work and thereafter refused publication until an anonymous edition appeared in 1821. Though clearly prompted by William Pitt's early response to the revolution, Knox conceived of and discussed his subject in the broadest terms. Man, born in a &#145;state of simplicity&#146; and possessed of a natural &#145;benevolence, improvement [and] cheerfulness&#146;, had been gradually corrupted by dishonest politicians, courtiers, and manipulative churchmen who sought through a &#145;spirit of despotism&#146; to maintain the fiction of a &#145;progress to civilization&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Despotism</span>, 1821, 5).<br>
<br>As in his theology, Knox linked politics to questions of personal conduct and to the potential for reform at the level of the individual reader. Perpetrators of despotism, whom in Britain he identified as tories and Jacobites, were characterized as selfish, unfeeling, duplicitous, and aggressive&#151;war being for Knox a calculated means of subduing those who demanded justifiable political reform. By contrast, (whig) defenders of the liberties enshrined by the 1688 settlement were &#145;men of feeling and good minds&#146; who embodied &#145;manly sentiment&#146; and displayed an integrity born of a sound educational programme like that in his earlier <span class="italic">Personal Nobility, or, Letters to a Young Nobleman</span> (1793), dedicated to Fox. Here Knox combined civic and sentimental languages by calling on the country's natural aristocratic leaders to participate in self-analysis so as to best fulfil their political responsibilities. In <span class="italic">The Spirit of Despotism</span> he looked also to a free press, to the judiciary, and to &#145;the middle ranks of the People&#146;&#151;in whom he believed the &#145;Spirit of Truth, Liberty and Virtue&#146; to be strongest&#151;to resist further erosion of national liberties. It was the duty of such groups to maintain the separation of legislature and judiciary, to resist government attempts to pack the Lords with placemen, and in the Commons to place the principles of political liberty above the demands of party affiliation. Written quickly in response to a charged political situation, it is perhaps not surprising that <span class="italic">The Spirit of Despotism</span> provides a number of contradictory statements which undermine its effectiveness as a work of political science. Thus, man is both able (and should be encouraged) to progress and yet is corrupted, not civilized, by that progression; medieval society was both less corrupt and yet also more greatly restricted by a chivalry defended by advocates of despotism such as Edmund Burke; it is the middle class who will restore liberty while bourgeois commercialism exists as one of the means to promote despotism. This said, for a writer who is often wrongly identified for his platitudes and conservatism, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Despotism</span> provided whig reformers with a passionate and positive critique both of tory resistance to political change and of former supporters, like Burke, whose defence of the 1688 settlement was thought less progressive than nostalgic.<br>
<br>Knox's final area of study was English literature. In 1783 he published an anthology, <span class="italic">Elegant Extracts, or, Useful and Entertaining Passages in Prose</span>, which reached its tenth edition in 1816 (also abridged in 1791 as <span class="italic">The Prose Epitome</span>), following this with <span class="italic">Elegant Extracts &hellip; in Poetry</span> (1789; 8th edn, 1816; also abridged in 1791), and <span class="italic">Elegant Epistles, or, A Copious Collection of Familiar and Amusing Letters</span> (1790). As before, Knox's motivation was the education and improvement of a youthful and middling readership&#151;&#145;the man of a liberal profession &hellip; [and] the mercantile classes&#146;&#151;otherwise too busy to study classical literature in full  (<span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; in Poetry</span>, 1805, vi). As in his own writing, the non-fiction essay and its modern exponents, among them Addison, Johnson, Richard Steele, and Hugh Blair, featured prominently in his selection of prose writers. While not ignoring classical writers, one of Knox's principal aims was to identify and introduce to the canon those elements of modern literature he believed of particular benefit for &#145;the commerce of ordinary life&#146;. His focus also resulted in a noticeably generous coverage of eighteenth-century women writers, including Anna Aiken, Hester Chapone, and Catharine Macaulay (<span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; in Prose</span>); Elizabeth Rowe, Elizabeth Carter, Helen Maria Williams, and Ann Yearsley (<span class="italic">Extracts &hellip; in Poetry</span>); and Elizabeth Montagu, Anna Seward, and the ladies Wortley Montagu, Luxborough, and Bradshaigh (<span class="italic">Elegant Epistles</span>). Appreciative of established talents and alert, here and in other works, to the potential of female students, Knox combined his promotion of modern women's writing with an ongoing campaign against sources of false learning. Principal among these was the reading of modern fiction&#151;for Knox an alarmingly introspective, and predominantly female, experience of no discernible social benefit&#151;whose dangers he believed reached new levels with the current vogue for &#145;fine sentimentalists&#146; like Laurence Sterne. Knox's own literary tastes, and their influence, are clearly reflected in the coverage of the Tonbridge School library during his mastership. Well stocked with writers featured in the three series of <span class="italic">Elegant Extracts</span>, the catalogue lists only a handful of continental authors, among them Cervantes and Fenelon, and no works of British fiction before an edition of Walter Scott's novels was purchased in 1819, seven years after Knox's retirement.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>After his wife's death in May 1809 and his retirement from Tonbridge School three years later, Knox moved to Adelphi Terrace, Strand, London. His final decade was spent supervising enlarged and improved editions of his <span class="italic">Extracts</span> and, latterly, with a return to the debate on education. When a proposal to diversify the role of grammar schools, by compelling them to offer tuition in reading, writing, and arithmetic to the poor, came before parliament in 1821, Knox dashed off a lengthy protest. In his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Tendency of Certain Clauses in a Bill now Pending in Parliament to Degrade Grammar Schools</span> he robustly defended the continued value of a classical education as a training for adult life and argued that a grammar school education should be claimed by &#145;the mass in middle life &hellip; as their birthright&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1824, 4.280). He was insistent that the classical curriculum that had been taught in grammar schools for several centuries should not be debased by the addition of elementary education in the three Rs. However, he was by no means an opponent of the education of the lowest orders and in a sermon delivered in 1814 had supported the efforts of the National Society to set up more schools where the poor would be taught according to the precepts of the Church of England. Soon after his pamphlet was published the parliamentary bill to reform the grammar schools was shelved.<br>
<br>Knox's popularity, particularly as a conduct writer and literary commentator, is evident from the numerous editions to which his studies ran, as well as from their publication in the United States where his contribution to the morality of a new nation was recognized with a doctorate from the College of Philadelphia. In Britain Knox's reputation was sufficient for him to be cited in contemporary works, such as Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span> (1816), in which Mr Martin reads aloud to his family from <span class="italic">Elegant Extracts</span>. That Martin, a plain, middling farmer, sought edification through the anthology would no doubt have pleased its compiler greatly. Some, of course, were less favourable to Knox's campaign for moral and literary self-improvement. For John Aikin his work suffered from an overly prescriptive focus, his &#145;great fault&#146; being to set out &#145;with too confined a view of the ends of education &hellip; Does he not breed them all for clergymen and schoolmasters?&#146;  (L. Aikin, <span class="italic">Memoirs of John Aikin</span>, MD, 2 vols., 1823, 1.59); an interesting observation given Knox's emphasis in <span class="italic">Liberal Education</span> on learning as more than vocational. Others questioned the consequences of his attempt to reach a broad readership. The <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, for example, was sceptical of the intellectual value or utility of essays written for those unused &#145;to deeper studies, to accurate investigations, or a long train of reasoning&#146;  (48, 1779, 120), a view shared by Emma Woodhouse, though not necessarily by Austen who gave a copy of the <span class="italic">Extracts</span> to her niece. Supporters, by contrast, commended Knox's ability, the breadth of his writing, and his efforts to promote learning: the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> &#145;ranked the writer with the English Classics&#146;  (81, 1822, 196); James Boswell believed the <span class="italic">Essays Moral and Literary</span> superior to his own <span class="italic">Hypochondriack</span> papers for the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, while the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> attributed the &#145;extensive popularity of his writings&#146;, though inferior to Johnson's <span class="italic">Rambler</span> studies, to Knox's &#145;not inconsiderable&#146; merit (I. S. Lustig and F. A. Pottle, eds., <span class="italic">Boswell: the English Experiment, 1785&#150;89</span>, 1986, 19; <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 58, 1778, 141).<br>
<br>Given Knox's contemporary popularity it is striking that he is now so little known. Certainly some of his work has not aged well. Knox was an exhaustive and often exhausting writer who clearly liked the sight of his own pen. The account of the officers' conduct at Brighton, for example, which Knox himself dismissed as trivial, ran to 102 pages and included close analysis of reported exchanges. Modern references to Knox have tended to criticize an intellect and literary style which fell far short of Johnson's. More recently he has become a quotable source in cultural histories of manners and sentimental culture to which he was, undoubtedly, an important contributor. The predominant image to emerge from these accounts is of a social and political conservative peddling an unoriginal message. In certain areas, such as his writing on family relations, this judgement is fair. However, to treat Knox solely as a behavioural writer is to miss his advocacy of civic regeneration, pacificism, and the politics of reform. Attempts by the libertarian right to view his critique of state corruption as promoting freedom born of individualism likewise overlook a commitment to socially responsible conduct. Certainly the range of his output generates contradictions and unanswered questions. And yet common to all areas is the figure of the sociable, benevolent, civic-minded, and politically responsible citizen. In Knox, therefore, sensibility served less as an excuse for fashionable solipsism than as an exercise in individual and societal improvement in which the personal and political were as one.<br>
<br>Knox died at Tonbridge on 6 September 1821 and was buried in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul where a monument commemorates his dedication &#145;to the moral and intellectual improvement of man&#146;. His son Thomas remained at Tonbridge School until his death in 1843.<br>
