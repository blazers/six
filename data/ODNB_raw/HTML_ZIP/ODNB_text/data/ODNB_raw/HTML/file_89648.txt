<span class="headword">Penlez,  Bosavern</span>  (1726&#150;1749), <span class="occ">wigmaker and convicted rioter</span>, was born near Exeter. His father was a native of Jersey, and was purportedly educated at Oxford University, although details of his time there have not been found. After Oxford, Penlez's father took holy orders and secured a small preferment near Exeter. He died while his son was young, and so his father's friends arranged for Bosavern to be apprenticed to a barber and peruke maker in Exeter under the auspices of the Sons of the Clergy. Bosavern Penlez served his full term, &#145;with Honesty and Integrity&#146; according to the ordinary of Newgate's account, and went to London about 1747. He served under several masters there, two of whom were prepared to vouch for his good character at his trial at the Old Bailey in September 1749.<br>
<br>Penlez's historical significance lies in his participation in the Strand riots of July 1749 and the controversies that arose from it. The riots began on Saturday 1 July, when three sailors from the man-of-war <i>Grafton</i> were entertained at the Crown tavern near St Mary in the Strand and complained that the prostitutes there had robbed them of their watches, thirty guineas, four moidores, and a banknote worth &pound;20. They protested to the landlord, but were unceremoniously ejected from the tavern. Vowing revenge, the sailors returned with their shipmates and proceeded to gut the tavern, throwing the goods, beds, and clothes of the house in the street and burning them on a bonfire. Soldiers from the Tilt Yard were called in, but they arrived too late to prevent the destruction of the moveables in the house. On the following evening the tars returned again, this time attacking the Bunch of Grapes, another bawdy house a few doors to the east. Then, around midnight, they moved to the Star tavern opposite Devereux Court, and quite close to Temple Bar. The landlord of this tavern was one Peter Wood, who had run a respectable alehouse between 1745 and 1748 before turning it into a brothel. It was on the testimony of Wood, his wife Jane, and their servant-cum-shoemaker James Reeves, that Bosavern Penlez was indicted under the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span> of 1715 for attempting to demolish a house.<br>
<br>Penlez was not present when the attack on the Star first started. He had been drinking much of the day with three different friends, one of whom was celebrating his birthday. Penlez was probably very drunk when he fell in with the crowd at the Star. He was identified as smashing up the fore-parlour of the bawdy house and threatening the landlord on the stairs. He was not arrested on site, unlike some others indicted under the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span>, but was discovered asleep in Carey Street by the watch with a bundle of linen caps, aprons, ruffles, and handkerchiefs by his side. These articles were later identified by Jane Wood as belonging to the house. For the theft of these items, which some felt had been planted on him, he was also indicted for a capital felony.<br>
<br>Henry Fielding&#151;the Bow Street magistrate who examined the rioters&#151;feared that the bawdy house riots would escalate into an attack on property in general. On his advice the duke of Bedford decided to prosecute most of the rioters under the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span> rather than for the theft of articles stolen from the bawdy houses. Of the six so indicted one died in prison and two had a finding of <i>ignoramus</i> on their indictments, including one gentleman, Edward Wrench, who was alleged to have verbally incited the mob to destroy the brothels. Of the three left, Benjamin Lander had a reasonably compelling alibi, leaving two&#151;Penlez and John Wilson, a journeyman shoemaker&#151;who were found guilty and sentenced to death. In coming to this decision, however, the jury recognized that the two journeymen had been convicted on the testimony of disreputable people; at the trial the collector of the scavenger tax declared he &#145;would not hang a Cat or Dog upon their Evidence&#146;  (Old Bailey proceedings). The members of the jury were likely to have seen Penlez and Wilson as reckless youths mixed up in an enterprise not of their making. Indeed the few sailors taken up in the disorders had been rescued from the roundhouse by their fellows. Consequently the jury, mindful of the testimonials on behalf of the two men at the trial, put in a plea for mercy. So too did many inhabitants of St Clement Danes, in a petition to the duke of Newcastle several weeks after the trial, to be followed by further petitions to the king from various other parishes in the vicinity of the Strand.<br>
<br>Wilson was reprieved at the eleventh hour; Penlez was not. According to contemporary accounts he accepted his fate and begged his friends to resist any rescue attempt at the gallows. Rumours of such plans were rife, for in the tumbrils taking Penlez to Tyburn were sailors convicted of other capital crimes, and it was widely anticipated that seamen armed with bludgeons and cutlasses would plausibly try to save them from the noose, or failing that, from dissection by the surgeons. As it happened, Stephen Theodore Janssen, the sheriff in charge of the executions of October 1749, defused the situation by first refusing an armed guard to accompany his officers, and then by handing over all the bodies of the condemned to their friends and relatives. Penlez himself was buried at St Clement Danes at a service attended by hundreds; his funeral was paid for by public subscription.<br>
<br>Penlez was executed on 18 October 1749, but the debate over his fate was far from ended. Representations to the MPs for the city of Westminster had been made to intercede on his behalf, especially to Granville Leveson-Gower, Viscount Trentham, whose brother-in-law was the duke of Bedford, secretary of state for the southern department. Trentham declined to help, and his refusal cost him support when he stood for re-election in Westminster a month after Penlez's execution. Trentham's re-election was supposed to be a foregone conclusion, but after heavy polling and a protracted scrutiny he only scraped home by some 170 votes. Throughout the polling &#145;Penley's ghost&#146; emerged from a portable coffin to harangue the electors about the young man's fate. Not even Fielding's pamphlet vindicating the government's decision to hang Penlez, and published just four days before the election began, was able to contain the widespread feeling that a reckless youth was sacrificed at the altar of social order&#151;especially when it became clear that the attacks on bawdy houses remained the sole focus of the riots, both on the Strand and further east, and that the threat of anarchy was minimal.<br>
<br>To many, including John Cleland, author of <span class="italic">The Case of the Unfortunate Bosavern Penlez</span>, the attacks on houses of ill repute were simply rough justice, ridding neighbourhoods of public nuisances that were difficult to contain through the normal legal channels. Such attacks, it was argued, could not be construed as treasonable, and the youthful impetuosity of a Penlez should not have to pay the price for disorders that stemmed essentially from the more brazen behaviour of the demobilized seamen. In the end the Penlez affair, besides highlighting the plebeian fear of bodily dismemberment at death and the volatile mood of Tyburn at the mid-century, was an instructive lesson about the balance of judicial terror and mercy that characterized the practice of eighteenth-century criminal law.<br>
