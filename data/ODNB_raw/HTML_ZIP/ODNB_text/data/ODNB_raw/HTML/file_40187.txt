<span class="headword">Herbertson,  Andrew John</span>  (1865&#150;1915), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 11 October 1865 at Church Bank, Galashiels, Selkirkshire, the eldest of four children of Andrew Hunter Herbertson, a prosperous building contractor, and Janet Matthewson. He attended Galashiels Academy (1872&#150;9) and the Edinburgh Institution, later Melville College (1879). On leaving school he worked briefly for a firm of surveyors in Edinburgh before matriculating at the University of Edinburgh in 1886. He studied sciences at Edinburgh in 1886&#150;9 and 1891&#150;2 with considerable success, but took no degree. The single greatest influence on him was exerted by Patrick Geddes, whom he met at Edinburgh. In the 1890s he worked enthusiastically with Geddes in Edinburgh and followed him to Dundee as his demonstrator in botany in 1892. He undertook meteorological research in 1892&#150;3 at the Ben Nevis and Fort William observatories which, with further work at Paris and Montpelier, bore fruit in the publication with Alexander Buchan of the important <span class="italic">Atlas of Meteorology</span> (1899). At the same time he worked on the <i>Challenger</i> enterprise which had its offices in Edinburgh. He visited the University of Freiburg im Breisgau in 1895 and 1898 and graduated PhD of that university with a dissertation on world rainfall patterns in 1898: the work was published by the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) in 1901.<br>
<br>On 5 October 1893 at 3 North Fort Street, North Leith, according to the rites of the Evangelical Union church, Herbertson married Fanny Louisa Dorothy (1864&#150;1915), classics mistress, daughter of the late John Collingwood Richardson, journalist, and Louisa Moore. Dorothy was a scholar who wrote a biography of Le Play as well as collaborating with her husband in his geographical work. They had one son, Andrew Hunter (1894&#150;1917), and one daughter, Margaret Alice Louise.<br>
<br>Herbertson was lecturer in political and commercial geography at the University of Manchester (1894&#150;6), and from 1896 to 1899 lecturer in industrial and commercial geography at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, during which time he was an active member of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.<br>
<br>In June 1899 Herbertson went to the newly founded school of geography in Oxford as assistant to the reader (Halford Mackinder, who had personally sought him out after hearing that he had been offered a post in America) and lecturer in regional geography. He stayed at Oxford until his death, succeeding Mackinder as reader in 1905 and being appointed to a personal chair in geography in 1910. On arrival in Oxford he was highly unusual in having a higher degree in geography and an active research interest: yet in Oxford he effectively abandoned research to throw himself into promoting geography in the university, in schools, and among those in professional life. In the university he worked tirelessly, not least because Mackinder was so often preoccupied with other interests. He lectured badly but doggedly, gave countless tutorials, and led numerous field excursions which his pupils remembered warmly. In 1910 he secured money from Abe Bailey, a South African entrepreneur, which allowed the school of geography to rent larger premises at Acland House, Broad Street, in addition to its rooms on the upper floor of the Ashmolean Museum, and to establish a library of colonial geography and history. Though he had abandoned research he did see awarded the first Oxford research degrees in geography (the BSc and BLitt), and was an active member of the RGS's research department from its foundation in 1903 (he had been elected fellow in 1892). Though no explorer himself he encouraged explorers such as Nansen, Shackleton, and Hedin to visit the school.<br>
<br>University geographers, like practitioners of other new disciplines, had to establish their subject in secondary schools to secure it a future at university. Through unremitting work, considerable powers of organization, and genuine enthusiasm Herbertson made a distinguished contribution to school geography. Following Mackinder he organized biennial summer schools at Oxford at which distinguished university teachers from Britain and abroad taught schoolmasters and schoolmistresses in the class and in the field. The schools were inspired by those of Geddes where the Herbertsons had first met, and R. N. Rudmose Brown described the couple during the summer courses:<blockquote>Herbertson &hellip; the small active man, the eager encouraging teacher, restless, continually at work, never learning to play or rest; or Mrs Herbertson, busy, energetic&#151;even more so than Herbertson, a driving force at the summer schools, always everywhere, keeping everyone up &#145;to scratch&#146;. (Brown, 107)</blockquote>More than 850 teachers attended the five schools organized by Herbertson between 1909 and 1914 and the influence he thus exerted on British school geography was immense. The Herbertsons were prolific authors of school textbooks: more than 1.4 million copies of their textbooks were used in the specialist secondary school teaching required under the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. He produced a new series of wall maps (published 1914&#150;15). He was secretary of the Geographical Association (the professional society for geography teachers) from 1900 to 1915 and founding editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Geographical Teacher</span>, from 1901 to 1915; he used both roles to argue for more and better geographical education in schools, particularly through field classes and practical work. He successfully argued for the extension of the association's membership, hitherto confined to teachers from public schools, to those from council schools and persuaded the Ordnance Survey to supply sheet maps to schools at reduced cost so that less well funded schools could undertake map work. His patient negotiations won the support of the RGS for the association which might otherwise have seemed a rival.<br>
<br>Herbertson also promoted geography among professional men on imperial service. He organized lectures for Indian Civil Service probationers and taught surveying to probationers for the Egyptian and Sudan civil service. The school of geography provided facilities for colonial civil servants on furlough. Herbertson was concerned about the geographical ignorance of those in positions of influence in the empire. In his presidential address to the geographical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1910 he suggested that each colonial government have a geographical-statistical department supplying information to a central imperial intelligence department, staffed by university trained geographers.<br>
<br>The imperial theme underlay all his activity. For university geographers he edited with his colleague O. J. R. Howarth the six-volume <span class="italic">Oxford Survey of the British Empire</span> (1914), described by Symonds as &#145;a fascinating picture of Oxford's perception of the empire at its highest tide&#146;  (Symonds, 147): and he dreamed (in vain) of setting up an institute of imperial geography and history in Oxford. Works presented to the school of geography during Herbertson's readership by the India Office, the War Office, and various colonial governments gave Oxford geography a clear imperial focus. The imperial theme was also evident in his school textbooks and from his work for those on imperial service, but it was more complex than has sometimes been suggested. He argued that geography should foster first a local patriotism, and then successively affection for and loyalty to country, empire, and the world  (in &#145;Geography&#146; in <span class="italic">The Practice of Instruction</span>, ed. J. W. Adamson, 1907, 191&#150;248). Later commentators interpret this as a vision of geography as a tool of empire  (Symonds, 143), but earlier observers saw instead a vision of geography as a medium for understanding between peoples at a time when imperialism and militarism were at their height (Cossar, 486&#150;90; W. L. G. Joerg, &#145;Recent geographical work in Europe&#146;, <span class="italic">Geographical Review</span>, 12, 1922, 432). Similar differences of opinion surround his regional geography. Inspired by Geddes, Herbertson's classic statement of regional geography in &#145;The major natural regions of the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 25, 1905, 300&#150;12) long governed geographical practice. He argued for the delimitation of natural regions which &#145;should have a certain unity of configuration, climate and vegetation&#146;  (p. 309). In his lifetime and afterwards regional geography degenerated into an oversimplified and often racist matching of human type on to physical, usually climatic, region. Even Gilbert in a very kind memoir admitted that he had been &#145;surprised &hellip; by the crudity of some of [Herbertson's] deterministic statements&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Geography</span>, 326). Yet Herbertson had intended his regions to be natural as opposed to artificial and hoped that their use would help students, particularly school pupils, make sense of the world, not just learn facts about it, and draw together the physical and human sides of geography. Indeed towards the end of his life his concern for regions had a rather visionary quality, rejecting the &#145;superficial geographical inventory&#146; in favour of a &#145;regional psychology&#146; based on a &#145;loving familiarity&#146; with the region  (A. J. Herbertson, &#145;Regional environment, heredity and consciousness&#146;, <span class="italic">Geographical Teacher</span>, 8, 1915&#150;16, 153).<br>
<br>Herbertson was short, fair, and stocky and wore a pince-nez above a drooping moustache. His long-standing heart problems worsened greatly towards the end of his life, but did not stop his drilling with the reservists during the war, or lead him to cut back his teaching. He died suddenly at his country house at Spriggs Holly, Radnage, Buckinghamshire, on 31 July 1915 and was buried in St Cross churchyard, Oxford, on 2 August. His widow died at Spriggs Holly just over a fortnight later, on 15 August 1915. His sudden death, combined with the effects of war, left geography at Oxford without an honour school, let alone the grand institute of which he had dreamed. His death also left him with no award or medal from any learned society and without having taken up his seat on the RGS council. It was marked by only brief obituaries from colleagues obviously greatly saddened, but none the less caught up in the war.<br>
<br>He is remembered by the Herbertson memorial lecture, founded in 1917 by the Geographical Association (the last was given in 1994); the Herbertson Society founded in 1924 as the undergraduate geography society at Oxford, and in its early days with a life members' section to organize the excursions which Herbertson enjoyed (it survived for some fifty years and is still periodically revived); and the Herbertson prize offered in the geography final honour school at Oxford.<br>
