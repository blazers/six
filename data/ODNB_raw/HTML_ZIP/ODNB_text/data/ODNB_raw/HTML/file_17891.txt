<span class="headword">Mallett,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">dean of Lincoln</span>, was the son of William Mallett of Normanton, Yorkshire. He was a scholar of Queens' College, Cambridge (1519&#150;22), graduating BA (1522), MA (1525), BTh (1534), and DTh (1535), and preached before the university in 1532&#150;3. As a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Cromwell he became master of Michaelhouse in 1533, retaining this post until the college was subsumed into the larger foundation of Trinity in 1546, when he received a pension of &pound;20. Also in 1533 he acquired the vicarage of Rothwell, Yorkshire (which he resigned in 1543); in 1535 he became rector of Swillington, Yorkshire, retaining it until 1569. In 1536 and 1540 he was elected vice-chancellor of Cambridge. But he was slow to produce the foundation deeds of his own college as required by the royal visitors of 1535. Archbishop Cranmer, whose chaplain he had become by January 1536, asked Cromwell to excuse Mallett's delay because of his preaching duties in the diocese of Canterbury and at Paul's Cross. By April 1539 Mallett was chaplain to Cromwell himself, and employed by him at Cranmer's palace of Ford, Kent, in writing up a liturgical scheme. This was almost certainly a part of the texts (now BL, Royal MS 7 B iv) in which Cranmer first followed Lutheran models in adapting the canonical hours to the twofold office of matins and evensong. Cranmer hoped Mallett's &#145;diligence and pains in this business&#146; would earn him favour from Cromwell, to whom he commended his &#145;right judgment in learning, and discreet wisdom&#146;  (Cox, 367).<br>
<br>Cromwell's fall in 1540 doubtless impeded Mallett's advancement, but on 13 December 1543 he was granted a canonry of Windsor, in which he was installed on 24 December and which he retained for life. In 1544 he acquired the prebend of Yatton in Wells Cathedral (resigned by 1559). Up to this point he had been a keen reformer&#151;by his own later admission he had been deceived by &#145;new fangled two-penny books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.728). The turning point came when, by 1547, he completed the translation of Erasmus's paraphrase on <span class="roman">St John</span> which Princess Mary had begun but then abandoned. As Mary's principal chaplain and almoner in Edward VI's reign (by 1550 at the latest), Mallett (by now a staunch Catholic) was at the centre of the controversy over the princess's mass, which for a time threatened to become a major diplomatic crisis. Mass had been permitted in Mary's houses, but only in her actual presence. In July 1550 Mallett broke this compact by celebrating at Beaulieu in Essex before Mary took up residence there. The sheriff, apparently without waiting for orders from London, indicted Mallett, who fled to the north of England. In December the sheriff, by now backed by the privy council, was still seeking him. Finally in April 1551 the earl of Shrewsbury secured an arrest. Mallett was examined before the privy council at Durham Place and condemned for reoffending after having been forgiven his original fault, and also for persuading others to &#145;embrase his naughtie oppinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 3.267). He was committed to the Tower on the 29th. In answer to Mary's complaint the council told her that Mallett had been imprisoned for his original offence, compounded by his flight, and at the king's &#145;express orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 288).<br>
<br>Following Mary's accession in 1553 Mallett's career recovered dramatically. As precentor of St George's, Windsor, he supervised the restoration of Catholic ornament he had previously rejected. On 5 April 1554 he was appointed canon of Westminster, retaining his position until the chapter was dissolved in 1556. On 19 April the queen named him dean of Lincoln; he was installed by proxy on 29 May and in person on 7 September. He was also installed in the prebends of St Martin's (18 December 1556) and Corringham (28 January 1557) in Lincoln Cathedral, but rarely resided there. On 20 July 1554 he was appointed master of the hospital of St Katharine near the Tower of London, and on 23 May 1555 was exempted from first fruits of over &pound;300. To this office he gave his chief attention, refurnishing the church and house, and restoring choral services; but subsequently he could not find adequate singing men for any money, nor &#145;obedient parishoners&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/7, no. 77). In secular affairs he was JP for Middlesex and Berkshire from 1555, and in 1556 helped to interrogate state prisoners. On or before 3 September 1556 he became lord high almoner. In this capacity he gave the queen a gold crucifix as a new year's gift, accompanied by a letter heavy with classical allusion. On 10 April 1558 he was presented to the prebend of Stratton in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1558 Mallett received the temporalities of the see of Salisbury as bishop elect, but his advancement was halted by the queen's death on 17 November. In her will he received &pound;200 for masses for her soul. Following Elizabeth's accession Mallett accepted the return to protestantism and so kept his deanery. He resigned the mastership of St Katherine's on 6 November 1561, following a dispute with the executor of the previous master. He had been vicar of Lancaster from 1554 until his nomination to the episcopate. He was also incumbent of Ashbourne and Wirksworth, Derbyshire, in his patronage as dean of Lincoln, and the rectory of South Leverton, Nottinghamshire. As <i>ex officio</i> member of the 1563 convocation he assented to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> by proxy, and defended himself to Archbishop Parker against the accusation that he had preached against the Anglican classification of the sacraments. He died at Normanton, as owner of Malet's Hall there, on 16 December 1570. By his will of 14 December he made bequests to the poor women of Rothwell, Swillington, and Castleford (Yorkshire), to his sister, Jane Burtone, and to other kin. His brother Henry was canon of Lincoln.<br>
