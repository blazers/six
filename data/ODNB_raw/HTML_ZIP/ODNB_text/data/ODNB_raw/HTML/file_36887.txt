<span class="headword">Wickham,  Edward Charles</span>  (1834&#150;1910), <span class="occ">dean of Lincoln</span>, eldest son of Edward Wickham (1801&#150;1862), at one time vicar of Preston Candover, Hampshire, and his second wife, Christiana St Barbe, daughter of C. H. White, rector of Shalden, Hampshire, was born on 7 December 1834 at Eagle House, Brook Green, Hammersmith, Middlesex, where his father then kept a private school of high reputation. Here he received his early education, entering Winchester College as a commoner in January 1848. On 8 July 1850 he was admitted to a place in college, was senior in school in November 1851, and in January 1852 he succeeded to a fellowship at New College, Oxford, beginning his undergraduate career at the age of seventeen. In December 1854 he took a first class in classical moderations, and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in July 1856, winning the chancellor's prize for Latin verse in the same year, and the Latin essay in 1857. He graduated BA in 1857 and proceeded to the degrees of MA in 1859, and of BD and DD in 1894.<br>
<br>Wickham was ordained deacon in 1857 and priest in 1858, and after two years' experience in teaching sixth book at Winchester he was recalled to Oxford, where he still retained his fellowship, by the offer of a tutorship. Here he took a leading part in the series of reforms which threw New College open to scholars and commoners who had not been educated at Winchester, and he helped to amend the statutes so as to allow tutors and other college officers to retain their fellowships after marriage. In conjunction with his friend Edwin Palmer of Balliol he initiated the system of intercollegiate lectures. Wickham's fine scholarship, his influence with the undergraduates, and his power of preaching made him one of the most successful tutors of his time, and it was largely owing to him that New College was transformed into one of the leading colleges.<br>
<br>In September 1873 Wickham succeeded Edward White Benson as headmaster of Wellington College, and shortly afterwards, on 27 December 1873, he married Agnes (1842&#150;1931), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10787/', "William Ewart Gladstone")</script>. Wickham's twenty years' tenure of the headmastership attracted differing judgements. His cold manner and unimpressive physique (the duke of Wellington, one of the governors, thought him lacking in height and girth) stood in the way of anything like general popularity among boys or masters, and he was subjected to many personal attacks. A series of crises not of his making, notably two epidemics (1883 and 1891) attributed to defective sanitation, and the appointment of a royal commission (1879&#150;80) in response to complaints from army officers that the school's endowment was not being applied to their benefit, effectively ruined his ambitious schemes for expansion. Although in the shadow of a predecessor of almost legendary reputation, he succeeded in leaving the school better equipped and organized than he found it. A fine classical scholar, he devoted his leisure to an elaborate edition of Horace (2 vols., 1874, 1893).<br>
<br>In politics Wickham was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party, following his father-in-law with absolute faith and devotion. After Wickham resigned from Wellington in the summer of 1893, Gladstone, ignoring charges of nepotism, appointed him dean of Lincoln in succession to William John Butler in January 1894. He showed great administrative skill in both cathedral and city affairs. His sermons, exquisitely delivered and given in fastidiously chosen language, had been widely appreciated both at New College and Wellington, and he was chosen select preacher before the University of Oxford for four different years. Wickham also took a prominent share in the debates of convocation and was a member of the committee on prayer book revision. He was active in the organization of primary and secondary education in the diocese of Lincoln, and was vice-chairman of the city education committee. Although he defended the Anglican position in the controversies following the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, he was conciliatory towards nonconformists, acting as one of the leading spirits on the education settlement committee formed in 1907 to bring nonconformists and churchmen together.<br>
<br>Wickham died on 18 August 1910 at Sierre in Switzerland, where he had gone with his family for a holiday. He was buried there, Dr Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury, performing the service. He was survived by his wife and two sons and three daughters.<br>
