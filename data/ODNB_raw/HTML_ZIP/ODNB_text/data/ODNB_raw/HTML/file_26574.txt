<span class="headword">Stone,  Jerome <span class="st"> [Jeremiah]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1727, <em>d.</em> 1756), <span class="occ">scholar and poet</span>, son of William Stons (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1730) and Janet Hoggos (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1758) of Leven, was baptized on 19 March 1727 in the parish of Scoonie in Fife. He had two brothers and a sister. When he was only three his father, a seafaring man, died abroad leaving his mother in poverty. After a basic education Stone travelled around as a chapman, often passing through St Andrews. He began by carrying small articles such as buckles and garters and progressed to selling books. Without any tutoring he learned how to read and translate both Hebrew and Greek, and assisted by the parish schoolmaster, John Turcan, he mastered Latin. Later Stone was befriended and supported by the Revd Thomas Tullidelph, professor of divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews, and principal of St Leonard's College, a Scoonie parish heritor. In 1747 Tullidelph set in motion negotiations that led to the amalgamation of St Leonard's and St Salvator's to form a United College in the University of St Andrews. Tullidelph encouraged Stone to study at the university and arranged for him to have free access to lectures. Stone's name appears twice in the registers in the Latinized version of Hieronimus. He enrolled in the Greek class on 24 February 1748 and graduated MA on 11 June 1750. Stone was highly regarded by the professors for his wide-ranging proficiency and by his fellow students for his wit and pleasantry. Before the end of his third session the rector of the school in Dunkeld applied to the university for an assistant and Stone was recommended for the post. Two or three years later the rector transferred to Perth and by the favour of the duke of Atholl, who thought highly of him, Stone was promoted in his place.<br>
<br>In his limited leisure time Stone devoted himself to further linguistic studies and to writing poetry. When his friend Andrew Angus, a librarian at the university, with whom he had lived for some time, died in 1749 at the age of eighteen, Stone wrote a commemorative poem, and in March of that year his poem on the marriage of another friend was published in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. Stone's manuscript folio in the University of Edinburgh Library contains a substantial number of his original poems in English as well as translations from the French of Boileau and the Italian of Tasso. In February 1755 a letter from Stone about Samuel Johnson's dictionary appeared in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. This was followed in June by another containing a paraphrase of a description of a May morning written by Gavin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, as a prologue to his translation of the twelfth book of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, in which Stone found beauties &#145;amidst the rubbish of antiquated orthography, and an obsolete dialect&#146;  (p. 294).<br>
<br>Stone's most significant contribution to the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, however, was a letter dated 15 November 1755 that appeared in January 1756. He wrote:<blockquote>Those who have any tolerable acquaintance with the <i>Irish</i> language, must know, that there are a great number of poetical compositions in it &hellip; Several of these performances are to be met with, which for sublimity of sentiment, nervousness of expression, and high-spirited metaphors, are hardly to be equalled among the chief productions of the most cultivated nations. (pp. 15&#150;17)</blockquote>As an example he translated the Gaelic poem <span class="italic">Fraoch's Death</span>, which he entitled <span class="italic">Albin and the Daughter of Mey</span>. This item thus appeared four years before June 1760 when James Macpherson published his volume of <span class="italic">Fragments of Ancient Poetry Collected in the Highlands of Scotland and Translated from the Galic or Erse Language</span>. That book, extracts of which were reprinted in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> in July 1760, led in due course, after James's publication of <span class="italic">Fingal</span> (December 1761; dated 1762), <span class="italic">Temora</span> (March 1763), and <span class="italic">The Works of Ossian</span> (1765), to the controversy about the existence of the poet Ossian.<br>
<br>Stone's manuscript folio contains extracts of some of his letters to John Turcan, including one subscribed &#145;Hieronimus Lapis&#146;. There are also copies of a sequence of five letters to Tullidelph, beginning on 8 July 1755, that clearly demonstrate Stone's rightful claim to be among the earliest scholars of ancient Gaelic poetry. In his first letter he confirms an already communicated intention to study &#145;the Irish language with all the Diligence my Leisure and Disengagements from Studies of a more important concern would admit of&#146;. He is convinced that this will enable him &#145;to follow the ancient Celts in their numberless Migrations, and rescue from oblivion several of the Heroic Actions of that People&#146;. The folio contains ten lengthy specimens of ancient &#145;Ossianic&#146; poetry as well as a collection of seven more modern Gaelic songs. There are six chapters of &#145;An enquiry into the original of the nation and language of the ancient Scots, with conjectures about the primitive state of the Celtic, and other European nations&#146;. Finally, there are eleven pages of an item entitled &#145;Of the immortality of authors: a vision by Mr Stone&#146;.<br>
<br>In Stone's last letter to Tullidelph, dated 6 May 1756, he says that his mother, who has lived with him for the past four years, is now &#145;pretty much worn out with old age&#146; and wants to spend the rest of her days with her friends in Fife. His &#145;Enquiry&#146;, with explanatory notes, quotations, and so on, will, he believes, make two octavo volumes or thereabouts. However,<blockquote>At present, to prevent useless Speculations, I keep my Designs a profound Secret from every Body here. Besides you, there is not three Persons in the World, that knows any Thing of it, further than Hints, Surmises, and the like.</blockquote>Stone died of a fever, at Dunkeld, on 11 June 1756. He never married. His mother survived him, supported by an annual pension from the duchess of Atholl.<br>
