<span class="headword">Lawton,  Harold Walter</span>  (1899&#150;2005), <span class="occ">soldier and French scholar</span>, was born on 27 July 1899 at 28 Grove Street, Burslem, Staffordshire, the son of William Thomas Coates Lawton, potter's tile fixer, and later owner of a tile-laying and mosaics business, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill. He attended Newcastle-under-Lyme middle school, and then Rhyl grammar school, after a family move to north Wales. In 1916 he enlisted as a private, initially with the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He was sent to the western front with the Manchester regiment in 1917. In March 1918 he was dispatched to B&eacute;thune to help the 4th battalion, East Yorkshire regiment, hold the line against a major German offensive. The German army redoubled its attack on 8 April. Lawton's battalion was sent to reinforce Armenti&egrave;res. The enemy outflanked Lawton and six companions as they attempted to reoccupy a trench that had just been abandoned. They were cut off for several days, with limited supplies and no officer support, before the Germans came to take them prisoner. At first incarcerated in a cage in a field, Lawton next spent a brief period in the fortress at Lille known as the Black Hole, where conditions were intolerable. He was transferred to Germany, eventually to a prisoner-of-war camp at Minden, where, as a better-educated prisoner, he spent the rest of the war peeling potatoes.<br>
<br>After this &#145;interruption&#146; Lawton began to study for a degree in French at the University College of North Wales in 1919. He graduated BA in 1921, and MA in 1923, with a dissertation on Roman Gaul. In 1923 he embarked on doctoral research in Paris under Henri Chamard, one of the first French scholars to specialize in Renaissance French literature. Lawton was awarded his doctorate in 1926 for a thesis on the dissemination and influence in sixteenth-century France of the Roman comedies of Terence. It was a massive undertaking. Terence was a major school author and a formative influence on French writers brought up, as almost all were at that period, to imitate the elegance of classical Latin. Lawton was working as something of a pioneer in a body of literature that was only just being opened up to scholarly investigation, but his valuable expertise in Latin enabled him to underpin his research with the methodological rigour associated with classical studies. The result was a two-volume study entitled <span class="italic">T&eacute;rence en France au XVIe si&egrave;cle</span>, of which the first part was devoted to Latin editions and French translations of the plays and the second to imitations by French playwrights. The first volume was published in Paris in 1926, but it was not until 1970 and 1972 that both volumes appeared in print. The work set a standard for research into early printed editions of an ancient author and for study of the impact of the classical tradition on vernacular culture.<br>
<br>In 1926 Lawton was made lecturer in French at University College, Southampton, where he was promoted to the chair of French in 1937. In 1950 he was appointed professor of French at Sheffield University, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1964. His far-sighted administrative skills, spiced by a subversive sense of humour that manifested itself in witty limericks and deft caricatures, were widely appreciated. As pro-vice-chancellor of Sheffield from 1961 to 1964 he was active in preparing the university for the student expansion of the 1960s.<br>
<br>Lawton's main academic publications, apart from the magisterial work on Terence, were an extremely well-received anthology of texts (<span class="italic">Handbook of French Renaissance Dramatic Theory</span>, 1949) and an annotated selection of the poems of Joachim du Bellay (1961). But Lawton had other strings to his bow. A committed Anglican, he composed numerous sermons. Perhaps as a side-effect of this aspect of his life he was asked by the archbishop of Canterbury to produce a typescript of W. E. Gladstone's vast daily journal, held at Lambeth Palace, which he completed between 1933 and 1936. A happy consequence of this commission was that he was helped in the task by Bessie Pate (<i>d</i>. 1991), daughter of Thomas Coates Pate. They married on 8 July 1933, and had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Already a recipient of the M&eacute;daille d'Argent de la Reconnaissance Fran&ccedil;aise (1946) and named officier d'Acad&eacute;mie (1948), Lawton was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1999. This was not a belated tribute to his promotion of French studies, but to his position as a surviving veteran of the First World War. Indeed in his last years Lawton enjoyed considerable fame as Britain's only remaining former prisoner of war from that conflict. He himself became a rather amused object of historical research, providing lucidly recalled information for interviewers who came to visit him at his last address, Oak House residential home, Pond Lane, Greetham, Rutland. He died there on 23 December 2005 and was cremated on 3 January 2006. He was survived by his daughter, his sons having predeceased him.<br>
