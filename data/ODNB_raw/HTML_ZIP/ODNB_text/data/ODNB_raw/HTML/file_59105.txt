<span class="headword">Goddard,  Julia Bachope</span>  (1825&#150;1896), <span class="occ">children's writer and animal welfare campaigner</span>, was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, on 11 July 1825, the eldest daughter in the family of at least four daughters and three sons of Samuel Aspinwall Goddard (1796&#150;1886) and his wife, Jemima, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bachope (1800&#150;1875). Her father, who was from Brookline, Massachusetts, had settled in Birmingham, where he was an iron merchant and gun manufacturer, also writing pamphlets on free trade and currency reform; he was the consul of the United States in Birmingham, and became a naturalized British subject. Details of Julia Goddard's early life are obscure, but she remained for most of her life in the family home at Edgbaston with her parents and unmarried brother and sister. In 1863 she published her first children's book, <span class="italic">Karl and the Six Little Dwarfs</span>; more than twenty-five others were to follow. Clearly written and well presented, they earned Goddard considerable popularity among contemporaries. Since her death, however, her writing has rarely even merited a mention in bibliographical reference works. She also wrote a number of pieces for contemporary journals and magazines and was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</span>.<br>
<br>Many of Goddard's children's books, such as <span class="italic">The Four Cats of the Tippertons and other Stories about Animals</span> (1881), focused upon the treatment of animals, reflecting her lifelong endeavour to improve their condition. She was, according to one contemporary animal welfare publication, &#145;one of the hardest and yet most unpretentious workers the movement has yet possessed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Animals' Friend</span>). Goddard does not appear to have been associated with the more radical elements in the animal rights' movements or anti-vivisection campaigns: she was not herself a vegetarian, arguing instead for more humane methods of animal slaughter. Indeed, she personified a particular brand of moderate humanitarianism, advocated by publications such as the <span class="italic">Animals' Friend</span>, which applauded her work, and to which she contributed.<br>
<br>Goddard's abiding aim was to ensure that all children were instructed in the correct and humane treatment of animals, arguing that &#145;The subject must be taught as much as any other subject of education&#146;  (Goddard, 87&#150;8). She believed that such a move would not only contribute greatly to an improvement in animal welfare but also have a dramatic effect in uplifting the morality of the young. She persistently urged the Department of Education to make the proper treatment of animals a compulsory element in the school curriculum; while she did not achieve this goal, the department did recommend teachers to include such lessons in their pupils' reading courses. Goddard encouraged and publicized the works of writers such as the Revd J. G. Wood and F. H. Harkwell, who wrote books designed for teachers' use on natural history and kindness to animals.<br>
<br>Goddard was best remembered for her establishment of an annual prize to school pupils in her home town, Birmingham, from 1876 onwards. This was in keeping with her philosophy that positive inducements and not merely punitive measures were required if a sea change was to be effected in the country's treatment of animals. The scheme, which she devised with the assistance of J. A. Langford, a former secretary of the Birmingham Co-operative League, was awarded on the basis of essays on the subject of animal welfare and <i>viva voce</i> examinations. It involved Goddard in the judging of up to two thousand essays each year and the organization of large public meetings to award the prizes. Such local dignitaries as John Bright and George Dawson publicly endorsed the scheme. Goddard was also known locally for her establishment of a competition to improve the treatment and conditions of horses and donkeys for hire in Sutton Park.<br>
<br>From 1894 Goddard suffered from extremely poor health following a severe attack of influenza. This, combined with her failing eyesight, forced her to give up her work. She died unmarried of a cerebral haemorrhage on 30 September 1896 at her cottage in Little Aston, near Sutton Coldfield, which she shared with her sister, Fanny Goddard. Her funeral took place on 5 October at Edgbaston church.<br>
