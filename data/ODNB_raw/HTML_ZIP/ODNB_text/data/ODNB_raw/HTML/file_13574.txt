<span class="headword">Holloway,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>John Milward]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, learned the linen trade as an apprentice to the iconoclast Walter Stephens of Bristol. On 17 September 1677 Holloway married Martha Stevens, possibly a kinswoman of his former master. As an established linen draper and merchant, he saw an opportunity to expand England's linen production when trade with France was embargoed in 1678. He travelled to London in the hope of persuading parliament to establish linen manufactories that would employ the indigent. Although he founded such an establishment in Warwickshire, hiring hundreds, the effort failed because his linen was not competitive with foreign imports. Holloway returned to London in the spring of 1679 to renew his quest for parliamentary backing. On 8 May, Bristol's common council approved his plan to erect a workhouse for 500 spinners from the city's Bridewell prison, but it had second thoughts after Sir John Knight, MP for Bristol, warned that the French embargo would expire in March 1681. About June 1680 Holloway told the earl of Essex about his vision of linen manufactories spread over 40,000 acres, employing 80,000, and providing &pound;200,000 p.a. to royal coffers. Essex sent him to Laurence Hyde, the lord treasurer, who introduced Holloway to Sir Edward Dering; he received money and advice to attend the next parliament. He did so, displaying some of his linen in the speaker's chamber, but members were preoccupied with the succession issue. At the Oxford parliament, the earl of Clarendon and others suggested he draft a bill to implement his plan, which he did, though once more his plans fell victim to the succession struggle.<br>
<br>Throughout this period, political fears had troubled Holloway. Allegations of the Popish Plot prompted him to worry that Englishmen might be enslaved if James, duke of York, became king. Allegations of a Catholic threat continued to trouble him at the time he attended parliament. A member of the whig Horseshoe Club in Bristol, Holloway brooded about the treatment of Stephen College in his trial at Oxford, the controversy surrounding Slingsby Bethel's efforts to empanel pro-whig jurors in London, Charles's desire to recall London's charter, and the disputed election of Dudley North and Peter Rich as sheriffs of London in July 1682.<br>
<br>Shortly after the London election, the Bristol clothier Joseph Tiley told Holloway about Shaftesbury's scheme for an insurrection in the autumn to rescue Charles from his &#145;evil&#146; counsellors. Confirmation came when Holloway met the Bristol attorney Nathaniel Wade in August; they concluded that 350 men, including 150 from the Taunton area, were needed to secure Bristol. To clear the streets, Holloway offered small ordnance from his shipping yard. However, the uprising was postponed. On 3 March 1683 Holloway went to London, where Wade informed him that planning was in the hands of Essex, Lord Howard of Escrick, Ford, Lord Grey, Lord William Russell, Algernon Sidney, John Hampden, John Wildman, and Francis Charlton. Before Holloway left London on the 6th, Wade introduced him to another plotter, Colonel John Rumsey. When Holloway returned to London on 5 April, he met the attorney Robert West. Swearing Holloway to secrecy, West outlined the plot to assassinate Charles and James as they returned from Newmarket. After his arrest in 1684, Holloway insisted he had condemned assassination as dishonourable and cowardly. On the 6th, the Bristol merchant John Row took Holloway to the house of Zachary Bourne, where he met Robert Ferguson. The latter apprised Holloway of current plans for a general insurrection, including the arrival of key Scottish dissidents in London. The same day Holloway conferred with Rumsey, who reputedly indicated he knew of the assassination scheme; after Holloway's execution in 1684, Rumsey denied this allegation. Holloway returned to Bristol on the 7th, but in early May he travelled to London, where he conferred again, independently, with West, Rumsey, and Ferguson, still professing, he later insisted, his opposition to assassination. Later the same month, Holloway participated in strategy sessions with West, Rumsey, Wade, Richard and Francis Goodenough, Edward Norton, and Thomas Walcott to enlist 3000 men in the London area. In the last meeting Holloway attended, he reiterated his objections to killing the royal brothers, pledging instead to support an uprising in Bristol. On his return there, he and others planned a surprise attack utilizing 350 men, scheduling it for 4 a.m. to avoid bloodshed. Some ninety men would suppress the mayor's guards while the rest secured strategic posts.<br>
<br>Holloway's difficulties commenced before Josiah Keeling disclosed the plotting to the government on 12 June. Holloway had fallen into substantial debt and feared incarceration. Moreover, about 1 May, Ralph Ollive, mayor of Bristol, had falsely accused him of attending a conventicle of open-membership Baptists and had him arrested and bound over to the Gloucester quarter sessions. Following Keeling's disclosure, Holloway disguised himself as a wool merchant and travelled through Somerset, Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire. On 12 July a grand jury indicted him for high treason, the state having three witnesses against him. In mid-August he returned to Bristol, where, with his wife's assistance, he hired a small ship to take him to France and the West Indies. He sailed on 23 August, stopped at St Ives to repair a broken mast, and reached La Rochelle on 17 September. With a cargo of brandy and other merchandise, he left for the West Indies on 4 October, arriving at Barbados on 11 November. Using the alias John Milward, Holloway conducted his business in Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Eustatius, and Anguilla. Reported by his own factor, he was apprehended in January 1684 and returned to England in chains, his ship reaching Bristol on 4 April. Upon his arrival he wrote a jeremiad in verse form, warning England of its sins and wondering,<blockquote>
<div>Who could have thought in seventy eight that we<br>
</div>
<div>Soe much enslav'd by eighty four should be.<br>
</div> (TNA: PRO, SP 29/437/91)</blockquote>If he were now to die, he thought, he had done his part to free England from Catholicism. Examined by the privy council on the 10th, he was ordered to compose a narrative of his involvement, but he failed to convince the government he was confessing everything he knew. An appeal for mercy to Sir Leoline Jenkins on the 14th was unsuccessful, and Holloway appeared in the king's bench a week later. Although a trial was unnecessary because he had been attainted by outlawry on an indictment of high treason, the attorney-general offered him one. Holloway refused, throwing himself on the king's mercy. He appealed to Charles and Sidney Godolphin, telling the latter that had the king &#145;not been Mercifull to popish Plotters I had never been a Plotter&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/437/127). On the scaffold at Tyburn on 30 April he proclaimed himself a member of the Church of England, insisted he had made a full confession, and averred he had never favoured assassination. He gave the sheriffs an account of the plotting dated 26 April, lamenting that he had brought ruin on his wife and children, censure on his friends, and great losses to his creditors. (After his death, officials in the West Indies discovered debts owed to Holloway of between &pound;400 and &pound;500.) Holloway also left a statement condemning reputedly illegal actions in recent years to establish arbitrary government and Catholicism. On 5 May the government ordered that his head and quarters be sent to Bristol for display on the city gates. Almost to the end Holloway had hoped for mercy, in return for which he promised to pursue his proposal to establish linen manufactories in England. He also offered a new plan to resettle hundreds of dissidents on an island in the West Indies.<br>
