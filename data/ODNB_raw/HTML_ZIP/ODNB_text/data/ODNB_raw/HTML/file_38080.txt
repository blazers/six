<span class="headword">Turner, Sir  Ralph Lilley</span>  (1888&#150;1983), <span class="occ">orientalist and academic administrator</span>, was born on 5 October 1888 in Charlton, London, the second of the three sons and third of the four children of George Turner (1852&#150;1929), schoolmaster, of Cambridge, and his wife, Bertha (1857&#150;1952), daughter of William Eaden Lilley. He was educated at the Perse School under W. H. D. Rouse, who introduced him to Sanskrit, and at Christ's College, Cambridge (senior scholar). He obtained first classes in the classical tripos (parts one and two, 1909 and 1911) and the oriental languages tripos (1910); was awarded the Brotherton memorial Sanskrit prize; and was elected a fellow of Christ's (1912). In 1913 he entered the Indian educational service as lecturer at Queen's College, Benares. From 1915 to 1919 he served in Palestine and India with the 2nd/3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha rifles; he was wounded, awarded the MC, and twice mentioned in dispatches. From 1920 to 1922 he was professor of Indian linguistics at Benares Hindu University. On 3 November 1920 he married Dorothy Rivers (1892&#150;1972), daughter of William Howard Goulty, solicitor; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1922 Turner was elected to the chair of Sanskrit in the University of London (at the School of Oriental Studies), which he occupied until the age of retirement in 1954. He wrote many important articles (later republished as <span class="italic">Collected Papers, 1912&#150;1973</span>, 1975) and <span class="italic">A Comparative and Etymological Dictionary of the Nepali Language</span> (1931), meanwhile steadily accumulating the vast collection of word slips on which his later lexicographical work was based. In 1942 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>These achievements were the more remarkable because from 1937 to 1957 Turner was also director of the School of Oriental and African Studies (as it became in 1938) with heavy administrative responsibilities. The early years of his tenure saw the creation under Ida Ward of the first department of the languages and cultures of Africa in a British university, and the successful negotiation of the school's removal from the City of London to Bloomsbury. After the outbreak of war his frequent warnings that the forces were seriously under-provided with personnel trained in key Asian languages went unheeded until Japan attacked, when the school was called upon to train many hundreds of young servicemen (including some Americans) in Chinese and Japanese for intelligence work in eastern theatres of war.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Turner was looking ahead to the post-war period. Largely through his patient, persistent advocacy, the government of Winston Churchill appointed in 1944 the Scarbrough commission, which, on the basis of evidence he submitted and marshalled, recommended a great expansion of the provision in British universities for the study of the languages, history, and cultures of Asia and Africa, and development of the school as the main centre. The government of C. R. Attlee accepted the recommendations; Turner's second decade as director was devoted primarily to implementing them, recruiting and training young scholars, including many whose interest had been aroused during war service in Asia or Africa, and building up strong academic departments. Self-effacing and reserved, he was nevertheless a resolute, wise, and far-sighted leader, universally respected and trusted. By 1957 the school was the pre-eminent institution in Europe in its fields of study. It had been a great directorship.<br>
<br>Thereafter Turner began to write <span class="italic">A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages</span> (1966), followed (1969) by indexes (by Lady Turner) and a phonetic analysis (1971). As an outstanding event in the history of Indian linguistic studies, it placed Turner alongside Sir William Jones and Sir George Grierson. He continued working until a week before his death and left virtually complete a large volume of addenda (published posthumously in 1985).<br>
<br>Turner was knighted in 1950. His many honours included the Nepalese order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, honorary doctorates of the universities of London, Benares, Santiniketan, Katmandu, and Ceylon; and honorary fellowships of Christ's College, Cambridge, the School of Oriental and African Studies, and Deccan College, Poona. He rendered great services to the Royal Asiatic Society (president, 1952&#150;5; gold medallist, 1953) and the Philological Society (treasurer, 1931&#150;62; president, 1939&#150;43). He died at his home, Haverbrack, Barrells Down Road, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on 22 April 1983.<br>
