<span class="headword">Mageoghegan <span class="st"> [Mag Eochag&aacute;in]</span>,  Conall</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1596&#150;1644), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the son of Niall Mageoghegan (<i>d</i>. 1596), chieftain, of Lismoyny, co. Westmeath, and grandson of Rosa Mageoghegan, a firm supporter of the English, who had been murdered in 1580; his uncle, also Rosa Mageoghegan, became a Dominican friar and was later bishop of Kildare from 1629 to 1644. Nothing is known of Mageoghegan's date of birth or his early life. He is best known for his translation into English of the so-called annals of Clonmacnoise, a collection of literary, hagiographical, and historical material laid out in annalistic format and purporting to extend from the earliest times to 1408. The original work in Irish is now lost, although there were reports in the middle of the nineteenth century that it was in the possession of Sir Richard Nagle, who was related to the Mageoghegans. Mageoghegan, who undertook the translation for his kinsman Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochl&aacute;in of Delvin, co. Westmeath, penned the preface to &#145;Terenc Coghlan&#146; at Lemanaghan, King's county, on 20 April 1627, while the entire work was completed on 30 June. Mageoghegan's own copy of the annals is not extant but there are four seventeenth-century copies, the two earliest dating from 1660 and 1661 respectively, and Sir James Ware made two pages of excerpts in the 1640s. An edition of the work published in 1896, based on a corrupted manuscript, is unsatisfactory, being incomplete and inaccurate.<br>
<br>Soon after completing the annals, Mageoghegan was associated with M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh who began writing his &#145;R&eacute;im r&iacute;oghraidhe na h&Eacute;ireann accus senchas a naomh&#146; (otherwise &#145;Seanchas r&iacute;ogh &Eacute;reann accus genealuigh na naomh n&Eacute;reannach&#146;, later edited by Paul Walsh under the title <span class="italic">Genealogiae regum et sanctorum Hiberniae</span>, 1918) in Mageoghegan's house at Lismoyny in 1630. On 4 November of that year Mageoghegan appended a note of approbation to &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's work in which he testifies that he, a gentleman, had seen the source materials from which the book was compiled. On 11 October 1636 he furnished a similar testimonium for &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's copy of the hagiographical poem &#145;Naomhsheanchus naomh Innsi F&aacute;il&#146;.<br>
<br>Mageoghegan was also in communication with James Ussher, the scholarly protestant primate. In August 1636 he had the great Connaught manuscript, the <span class="roman">Book of Lecan</span> (dating from about 1400), on loan from Ussher and transcribed some portions of it; the manuscript containing those transcripts is now lost but it was copied in September 1644 by P&oacute;l &Oacute; Colla in Mageoghegan's house in Lismoyny. It has been suggested that Mageoghegan may have furnished Ussher with translations of Irish texts and that his translation of the annals of Clonmacnoise may well have been prompted by the archbishop. An important fifteenth-century Irish manuscript  (BL, Add. MS 30512) was in Mageoghegan's possession for a time and contains colophons penned by him in 1630, 1631, and 1635; one of these recounts a phenomenal shower of hailstones in the counties of Westmeath, King's county, and Meath which occurred on 25 March 1635. The date of Mageoghegan's death is unknown.<br>
