<span class="headword">Debus,  Heinrich</span>  (1824&#150;1915), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Wolfshagen, Hesse, on 13 July 1824, the son of Valentine Debus, a dyer. His mother died when he was two, and although his father then married her sister, Debus was brought up by grandparents in Kassel. There he attended the B&uuml;rgerschule and, later, the polytechnic school, where he was inspired by the chemistry teaching of Robert Bunsen (1811&#150;1899). Bunsen moved to the University of Marburg in 1839, and when he was eighteen Debus joined him there, becoming his personal assistant and completing a PhD on madder in 1848. He was the first chemistry student at Marburg to present his thesis in German instead of Latin.<br>
<br>At Marburg, Debus became acquainted with Bunsen's English pupils Edward Frankland, John Tyndall, and Thomas Archer Hirst, with whom he enjoyed lifelong friendships. Through Frankland's influence Debus emigrated to England in 1851 to teach chemistry at Queenwood College in Hampshire. In 1867 he went to teach at Clifton College, Bristol. In 1870 he joined his English friends in London as lecturer in chemistry at Guy's Hospital medical school, and when Hirst became director of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1873 he invited Debus to become professor of chemistry there. Debus continued in both positions until his retirement in 1888, when he joined his only sister in Kassel. He returned to London each year to see his dwindling number of surviving friends.<br>
<br>Debus joined the Chemical Society in 1859 and was its vice-president in 1871&#150;4. He was elected FRS in 1861 and sat on the Royal Society's council in 1870&#150;72 and 1881&#150;3. He was president of the chemical section of the British Association at Exeter in 1869 and was intermittently the University of London's chief examiner in chemistry from 1864 until retirement. Debus was recognized as an excellent teacher, despite a German accent which he never lost. He was a confirmed bachelor with a quiet dignity and good humour, and was well known for the eccentricity of his dress. He was an ardent clubman and loved to meet and entertain his friends at the Saville or the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>Apart from some experimental work on the law of mass action in 1853, and of the explosion of gunpowder in 1888, all Debus's research was in organic chemistry. In 1856, while at Queenwood, he ingeniously oxidized ethyl alcohol to form the new compounds glyoxal and glyoxylic acid. Over a number of years he made a thorough investigation of the thionic acids and their derivatives. In retirement Debus published (in German) a critical historical study of Avogadro's hypothesis (1894) and some attractive reminiscences of Robert Bunsen (1901).<br>
<br>Debus was one of the last of the Victorian scientific hierarchy that controlled London science. He died at his home, 4 Schlagenweg, Kassel, on 9 December 1915, having remained physically and mentally alert to the end.<br>
