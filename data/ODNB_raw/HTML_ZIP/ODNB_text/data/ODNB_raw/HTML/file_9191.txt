<span class="headword">Farren <span class="st"> [Farran]</span>,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Elizabeth  Smith Stanley, countess of Derby]</span>  (1759<span class="mult">x</span>62&#150;1829), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was one of the five or six children of George Farran (<i>c</i>.1731&#150;1770), actor, and his wife Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (<i>c</i>.1732&#150;1803). Her birth date has been given as 16 July 1759  (Bloxam, 18), but the memorial plaque in Huyton parish church, Liverpool, has 6 July 1762, and she could plausibly have been the Elisabeth Farran, daughter of George and Margaret Farran, baptized at Thornbury, Gloucestershire, on 7 July 1761. Her father was the son of a Dublin wine merchant, one of a well connected Huguenot family. George's cousin Charles held high office in the Dublin court of the exchequer, and Charles's son (also Charles) became a major-general in the British army. George, however, disappointed his father by leaving the family business, for reasons unknown, and apprenticing himself to a surgeon-apothecary in Cork. George subsequently sailed for England in pursuit of a theatrical career, probably in summer 1753. Details are sparse, but it was probably while acting in Liverpool that he met and married Margaret Wright, daughter of a once prosperous Liverpool brewer. Later events suggest that she was strong willed and, like her husband, socially adroit.<br>
<br>Together they established a touring company of a little higher quality than some of its kind. Of their five or six children, the three who certainly survived infancy were daughters, and when George died in 1770 it was left to Margaret Farran to sustain and nurture them. She seems, somehow or other, to have ensured that neither their education nor their manners were neglected. Elizabeth's surviving letters are fluent and liberally sprinkled with not-quite-perfect French, and it was probably from her mother that she learned the craft of needlework. But it was in provincial theatres that mother and daughters strove to eke out a living in the years following George Farran's death. They were in Manchester, under the eccentric management of James Whitley, in 1773&#150;4, when Elizabeth was primarily employed as a singer, but it was Joseph Younger, manager of the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, who provided her first real acting opportunities, as Rosetta in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> and as an improbably youthful Lady Townly in <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span>, by Colley Cibber and John Vanbrugh. Younger's greatest service, though, was to recommend Elizabeth to George Colman the elder, newly engaged in the management of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket.<br>
<br>The Farran family arrived in London in May 1777, lodging close to the theatre in Suffolk Street, and Elizabeth Farren (the surname by which she was billed) made her London d&eacute;but as Kate Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> on 9 June. Colman was sufficiently impressed to cast her as Rosina for the premi&egrave;re of his own adaptation of Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's <span class="italic">Le barbier de Seville</span>, <span class="italic">The Spanish Barber</span>, on 20 August. Tall, slim, blue-eyed, and fine-featured, she quickly gathered a male following, but, always under the watchful eye of her mother, did nothing to blemish her reputation. Serious about acting from the start, and keen to improve her vocal powers, she took singing lessons with Jonathan Battishill during the summer of 1777, earning herself a re-engagement at the Haymarket in the summer of 1778. Her popularity grew, despite a general view that her figure was ill-suited to the breeches part she played in Colman's <span class="italic">The Suicide</span>, and her Lady Townly in <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span> enabled Londoners first to glimpse her refined playing of high-society ladies in comedy. With the summer season over, the managers of the two patent theatres competed for her, and she appeared at both Covent Garden and Drury Lane during October 1778. It was Drury Lane, however, that eventually won her, and her subsequent career, until she retired from the stage, was almost exclusively confined to performances there and, during the summer seasons, at the Haymarket. Seen from the outset as Frances Abington's rival in accurately portraying ladies of taste, Elizabeth eventually displaced her on the stage and outshone her in society.<br>
<br>The first helping hand in a social career that was both glittering and astonishingly discreet was offered by the &#145;queen of Ireland&#146;, Emily Fitzgerald, duchess of Leinster, who may well have known the Dublin Farrans. Charles James Fox was among Elizabeth's early suitors, but the second half of her life was bound up with that of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47080/', "Edward Smith Stanley, twelfth earl of Derby (1752&#150;1834)")</script>. The earl had been married to Lady Elizabeth Hamilton since 1774, and they had two children. A third child, though nurtured by Lord Derby after his wife absconded, was almost certainly fathered by the duke of Dorset, whose liaison with Lady Elizabeth had scandalized and entertained the age of gossip. By the time that the relationship between the cuckolded peer and the reputedly virginal actress became widely recognized, Lady Derby had returned home, ejected by her lover, but there was no pretence of reconciliation, although Lord Derby refused to divorce her. Instead, he and Elizabeth Farren waited for her to die. Famous as a patron of horse-racing (founder of the Oaks and transporter of the Derby to Epsom), the earl was also a keen amateur actor, and it was no doubt he who persuaded Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond, to invite Elizabeth to oversee the amateur theatricals at Richmond House in 1787 and 1788.<br>
<br>The 1780s were Elizabeth's years of triumph on the London stage&#151;she had added to her repertoire, among scores of less familiar roles, Hermione in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, and above all, Lady Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>&#151;but her engagement at Richmond House crowned all. These performances were not minor diversions, but social occasions of real significance, attended by George III and Queen Charlotte, by George, prince of Wales, and by the cream of London society. Always accompanied by her mother, and always discreetly behaved, Elizabeth presented herself as a worthy consort of the earl, whom she now observed on stage as he had customarily observed her. She and her mother would entertain Lord Derby in the house in Green Street, Mayfair, which they occupied from 1786 to 1797&#151;it was not far from the earl's London residence in Grosvenor Square&#151;but there was no verifiable impropriety in their constancy. Horace Walpole, who kept a miniature of Elizabeth in Strawberry Hill, was one among many observers of the invariable presence of Mrs Farran, whom he called La Signora Madre: &#145;In the evening&#146;, he wrote to Mary Berry in 1793, &#145;we went together to Miss Farren's and besides her duenna-mother, found her at piquet with her unalterable Earl&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 12.17&#150;18).<br>
<br>Never robust, Elizabeth retained her popularity at Drury Lane into the 1790s, but undertook fewer new roles. The decade had begun sensationally, when Thomas Lawrence's exquisite full-length portrait of her was exhibited at the Royal Academy in May 1790 alongside his commissioned portrait of Queen Charlotte, and Elizabeth deflected the renewed public clamour for novelty by her willingness to engage directly with her audiences in prologues and epilogues specially written for her. Perhaps her enthusiasm for her profession was waning; certainly she wasted no time in announcing her retirement from the stage when, on 14 March 1797, the countess of Derby died. On 8 April she made her farewell appearance at Drury Lane&#151;as Lady Teazle to a house that was reportedly forty-five over capacity and that provided the management with record takings at the box office. On 1 May, in a ceremony at Derby House, she married Lord Derby. On 11 May she was presented to the queen, and a week later, at the queen's choice, she was in the wedding procession for the marriage of Princess Charlotte, the princess royal. Actress she may have been, but the earl's second wife was altogether more acceptable than his first.<br>
<br>Already in her late thirties when she married, Elizabeth nevertheless bore her husband a child each March for the next four years. The first was a stillborn daughter, the second a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth (1799&#150;1809), who died ten years later, the third a son, James (1800&#150;1817), and the fourth a daughter, Mary Margaret (1801&#150;1858), who married Thomas Egerton, second earl of Wilton, and produced five children of her own. The household over which Elizabeth presided also included Lord Derby's two adult children (the questionable third had been married off in 1795), the four illegitimate children of his uncle General John Burgoyne and the singer Susan Caulfield, and, until her death in 1803, Elizabeth's mother. Lord Derby took his role as lord lieutenant of Lancashire seriously, and his hospitality at Knowsley House, near Liverpool, was famous. Each year from June to November the house was full of guests. There is abundant evidence, particularly in Thomas Creevey's letters, of Elizabeth's qualities as a hostess. During her long last illness, &#145;an ossification or some other fatal affliction of the heart&#146;  (Bloxam, 206), Creevey wrote on 3 December 1828 that &#145;Knowsley without Lady Derby is like a house with all the fires and candles put out&#146;  (Creevey, 250). She died at Knowsley House on 23 April 1829 and was buried on 30 April, after a grand funeral procession, in the Stanley family vault at St Peter and St Paul, Ormskirk, about 13 miles from Knowsley. After his death on 21 October 1834, Lord Derby was buried beside her. The brass plaque commemorating Elizabeth was originally in the nave of the parish church in Huyton, which the Derby family regularly attended when in residence at Knowsley. It was later moved to the chancel.<br>
