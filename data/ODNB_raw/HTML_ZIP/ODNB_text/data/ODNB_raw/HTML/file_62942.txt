<span class="headword">Raifteara&iacute;,  Antoine</span>  (1779&#150;1835), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 30 March 1779 at Cill Liad&aacute;in (Killedan), near Kiltimagh, co. Mayo, the son of a weaver; his mother's maiden name was Brennan. An attack of smallpox at five or nine years old left him blind for the rest of his life. With a view to eking out some kind of a living the young Raifteara&iacute; learned to play the violin, some say tolerably, others poorly. In any event he was taken in tow by a local gentleman, Frank Taaffe, as a sort of family bard, musician, and story-teller, but Taaffe's patronage came to an end either because of Raifteara&iacute;'s involvement in the loss of a favourite horse or because of his too vocal support for the republican organization the United Irishmen.<br>
<br>Raifteara&iacute; then migrated to south Galway, some 50 miles away, where the pickings were much better for one of his calling among the many well-off farmers of that area. The rest of his life he spent there, much in demand at house dances, weddings, and even wakes. While on such occasions the hat was invariably passed around for his benefit, there was also a deal of plying the blind bard with drink, with the result that he soon had a drink problem. There is no evidence that he ever married. However, it appears he lived with a woman named Siobh&aacute;n for some years, the liaison producing a daughter and a son before they went their separate ways.<br>
<br>The nature of Raifteara&iacute;'s calling as an itinerant bard posited a very public dimension to his songs and poems, for no sooner had he composed a piece than he was in a position to sing or recite it in public. Satires on people who somehow or other incurred the bard's displeasure and an argle-bargle with local fellow poets, the brothers Callanan, were all grist to the mill of a self-publicist whose interest it was to stay in the public eye.<br>
<br>South Galway was in Raifteara&iacute;'s time a bilingual society, most people being fluent both in Irish and English. However, the problem with Irish was that it was not taught in the schools and while most people could speak it, there were few who could read it and even fewer who could write it. Raifteara&iacute;'s output of about forty-eight poems is considerable for a blind man. Lengthy poems such as <span class="italic">Seanchas na sceiche</span> (&#145;The bush's history [of Ireland]&#146;), a sort of potted history of Ireland up to the 1690s, could scarcely have been accomplished without the aid of an amanuensis, who no doubt doubled as an editor or adviser. The public recitation of Raifteara&iacute;'s work by himself and others and its circulation in manuscript copies led inevitably to the emergence of many different variations and additions, with the result that few poets in the Irish language have had their work interfered with to such an extent as Raifteara&iacute;. The obverse of this is that some pieces, including the emotive <span class="italic">Mise Raifteara&iacute;</span> (&#145;I am Raifteara&iacute;&#146;), have been attributed to him which were not his.<br>
<br>Raifteara&iacute;'s work can be subdivided into poems about people and places, love songs, religious verse, and poems on current affairs and historical subjects. The poems about places characteristically develop into a listing over many stanzas of the flora and fauna of the place, a process which becomes tedious when repeated again and again. The well-known <span class="italic">Cill Liad&aacute;in</span> (&#145;Killedan&#146;), a celebration of Raifteara&iacute;'s native place, is no exception and would benefit from the dropping of four or five such stanzas. Similarly, poems about an assortment of tradesmen&#151;shoemaker, weaver, blacksmith, carpenter, and so on&#151;are little more than a stringing together in verse of the articles produced by such people. Seven or eight love songs, unlike many in that genre, have the merit that the subjects were real people, although Raifteara&iacute;'s efforts in that direction were not generally welcomed, for his love songs were said to bring bad luck.<br>
<br>Raifteara&iacute; celebrated in verse many local and national events, including the victory in the Galway election of 1833 of the Catholic Sir John Burke, the proselytizing activities of the Hibernian Bible Society, agrarian agitation by a secret society called the Ribbonmen, Daniel O'Connell's great victory in the County Clare election of 1828 which led to Catholic emancipation, and the tithe war of the 1830s.<br>
<br>In the final analysis, however, Raifteara&iacute;'s claim to fame rests on perhaps half a dozen pieces. Arguably, first among these must be <span class="italic">Eanach Dh&uacute;in</span> (&#145;Annaghdown&#146;), a piteous dirge about the drowning of nineteen people in an unseaworthy craft on Lough Corrib, co. Galway, in 1828. Strangely, for a man whose private life was anything but exemplary, two long religious poems must be classed among his best, <span class="italic">Agallamh Raifteara&iacute; agus an bh&aacute;is</span> (&#145;Raifteara&iacute;'s discourse with death&#146;) and <span class="italic">Achain&iacute; Raifteara&iacute; ar &Iacute;osa Cr&iacute;ost</span> (&#145;Raifteara&iacute;'s petition to Jesus Christ&#146;), a powerful call for repentance, not least by himself, in the face of a cholera epidemic. The latter was published posthumously in 1848 and accompanied by an English translation for the stated purpose of its being intelligible to the reading public. Also of lasting merit are some laments, notably that for Thomas Daly, piper and gentleman.<br>
<br>Raifteara&iacute; died in the direst poverty in a barn near Craughwell, co. Galway, on Christmas day 1835, and was buried in nearby Killeenin graveyard, probably on 27 December. His name was rescued from obscurity towards the end of the century through the initiative of the newly established Gaelic League (for the revival of the Irish language) led by Douglas Hyde (Dubhghlas de h&Iacute;de) and the Irish literary movement led by Lady Gregory and Yeats. The two movements combined to erect a commemorative slab over Raifteara&iacute;'s grave in 1900. Gregory wrote a play about Raifteara&iacute; and devoted a chapter of her <span class="italic">Poets and Dreamers</span> to him, while Hyde edited the first collection of his verse in 1903.<br>
