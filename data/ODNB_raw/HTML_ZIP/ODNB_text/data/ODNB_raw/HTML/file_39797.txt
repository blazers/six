<span class="headword">Blunt,  Christopher Evelyn</span>  (1904&#150;1987), <span class="occ">merchant banker and numismatist</span>, was born on 16 July 1904 at the vicarage, Ham Common, London, the second of the three sons (there were no daughters) of the Revd (Arthur) Stanley Vaughan Blunt (1870&#150;1929) and his wife, Hilda Violet (1880&#150;1969), daughter of (John) Henry Master of Montrose House, Petersham, London. He was educated at Marlborough College, but, unlike his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53211/', "Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt")</script>, writer and artist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30829/', "Anthony Frederick Blunt")</script>, art historian and Soviet agent&#151;both of whom were destined for academic careers&#151;he did not go to university. After a year in Germany and Spain and two years as a trainee accountant, in 1924 he joined the small banking house of Higginson &amp; Co. in London, which later became part of Hill Samuel. There he ultimately became head of corporate finance. Tall, fair, and patrician, he was a distinguished figure in the City for many years. In 1930 he married Elisabeth Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of Gardner Sebastian Bazley, barrister, of Hatherop Castle, Gloucestershire; they had a son and two daughters. The family moved from London to Hungerford, Berkshire, in 1944, and in 1952 to Ramsbury Hill, near Marlborough. For most of the war Blunt had worked for Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, being mentioned in dispatches for his liaison work in the evacuation from Bordeaux in 1940, and he was later engaged in preparations for the Normandy invasion. He was demobilized as colonel, and in 1945 was appointed OBE and the American Legion of Merit.<br>
<br>While at Marlborough, Blunt had met John Shirley-Fox, a leading student of medieval English coins, a subject to which Blunt himself was to devote the greater part of his leisure for the rest of his life. In 1935 he became director of the British Numismatic Society and from 1946 to 1950 was its president. The society, which had acrimoniously spun off in 1903 from the Royal Numismatic Society in order to give more attention to British coins, had lost momentum. Under his leadership its finances were strengthened, its membership increased, and its academic standing established.<br>
<br>From 1956 to 1961 Blunt served as president of the Royal Numismatic Society, finally laying to rest the lingering tensions between the two societies. In 1965 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy&#151;an exceptional distinction for an amateur scholar who had no formal education after his schooling, and one that recognized his leading role in establishing the <span class="roman">Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles</span>, a project for publishing fully illustrated catalogues of English coins in major collections in Britain and abroad. A committee was set up in 1953 with Sir Frank Stenton as chairman, the first volume appeared in 1958, and when Blunt died the fortieth was in course of preparation.<br>
<br>Blunt's early numismatic work was devoted to the later middle ages, but after the Second World War his interests turned towards the Anglo-Saxon series, largely neglected in the previous generation. Although increased responsibility in the City and his editorial duties with the <span class="italic">British Numismatic Journal</span> and the sylloge left relatively little time for his own research, in conjunction with R. H. (Michael) Dolley, appointed to the British Museum coin room in 1951, Blunt soon brought about a fundamental reappraisal of early English coinage. After retirement from Hill Samuel in 1964, he remained a director of Eucalyptus Pulp Mills Ltd and as chairman guided it through the difficulties of the political revolution in Portugal. But he was now able to devote most of his time to numismatics, moving on from the Heptarchic period between Offa and Alfred, on which he had previously concentrated, to the tenth century, during which previously fragmented English coinage gradually became unified. This work culminated in three seminal publications: a magisterial monograph on &AElig;thelstan (1974); for the British Museum, <span class="italic">Athelstan to the Reform of Edgar</span> (with Marion M. Archibald, 1986), volume five of <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Coins</span>; and <span class="italic">Coinage in Tenth-Century England</span> (with B. H. I. H. Stewart and C. S. S. Lyon, 1989). Blunt's contribution to English numismatics was exceptional. In addition to his own scholarly achievement, his judgement and diligence as editor had a pervasive influence on the standards of English numismatic literature for half a century. Through hospitality at Ramsbury and extensive correspondence he was able to provide a focus and continuity for a subject in which professional scholars have always been in a minority. Although distressed by revelations about his brother Anthony in 1979 and by the death of his wife, Elisabeth, in 1980, he continued to work productively until a few weeks before his own death at his home at Ramsbury Hill, on 20 November 1987. He was buried at Ramsbury. With the needs of future students in mind, one of his last acts was to provide for his magnificent coin collection (incorporating that of Shirley-Fox, which he inherited in 1939) to be offered to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, in lieu of estate duty.<br>
