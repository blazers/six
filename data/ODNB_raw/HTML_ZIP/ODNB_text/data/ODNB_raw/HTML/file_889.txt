<span class="headword">Auchmuty, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1758&#150;1822), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 22 June 1758 at New York city, the second son of Dr Samuel Auchmuty (1722&#150;1777), rector of Trinity Church, New York, and Mary Tucker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholls. The family were of Scottish origin, Dr Auchmuty's father, a lawyer, having emigrated to Massachusetts about 1720. This background, together with a family tradition of legal employment in government service, probably ensured that the family was loyalist. Having graduated BA at the college of New York, Auchmuty joined the British army, first as a volunteer, and was appointed ensign in the 45th regiment of foot on 11 January 1777. He was promoted lieutenant a year later, whereupon he returned to England with the 45th.<br>
<br>Following British defeat in the American War of Independence, Auchmuty's elder brother stayed in New York but one of his sisters and his uncle went to Britain as loyalist refugees; his sister married into a Kentish gentry family. Auchmuty chose to remain in the army but, without influence or wealth, his only route to promotion was service in India. In 1783 he transferred to the 52nd foot, then under orders for India, and was made adjutant. In 1788 he moved to the 75th foot, as captain. At this point, aged thirty, his career was effectively at a standstill.<br>
<br>Salvation came from the new governor-general, Lord Cornwallis, who may have had a soft spot for an American loyalist but who above all needed efficient and uncorrupt men such as Auchmuty in his campaign to promote reform in British India. Auchmuty served in the war against Tipu, sultan of Mysore (1790&#150;92)&#151;meanwhile gaining promotion to major&#151;right through to the siege of Seringapatam in 1792. Then he went to Calcutta as Cornwallis's deputy quartermaster-general to the king's forces in India. The next commander-in-chief, Sir Robert Abercromby, was also colonel of the 75th and soon made Auchmuty his military secretary, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; Auchmuty saw more service in the Rohilla war of 1796. He returned to Britain in 1797 with Abercromby and the remnants of the 75th.<br>
<br>With influence on his side at last (Cornwallis in the government and Abercromby in high military rank) Auchmuty was made lieutenant-colonel of the 10th foot in 1800 and went to the Cape of Good Hope as brevet colonel to take command of a force that was to sail to the Red Sea and, with troops from India, attack the French in Egypt. Sir David Baird, whom he had known in India, made Auchmuty adjutant-general of his force, and he took part in the desert march and the voyage down the Nile that captured popular imagination in Britain. He remained in Egypt until 1803, eventually as adjutant-general for the whole British force, and left with the evacuating forces. He was knighted on his return to Britain.<br>
<br>Auchmuty's next appointment was as commander in the Isle of Thanet, a post of danger between 1803 and 1806 with the threatened invasion by Napoleon. In 1806 he was promoted brigadier-general and was given command of reinforcements sent to the River Plate after news of the capture of Buenos Aires by an unauthorized expedition from the Cape. On arrival Auchmuty discovered that Buenos Aires had been retaken by the Spanish and the 71st foot captured. Reinforcements however had also arrived from the Cape, and with a force of 5000 men Auchmuty had an opportunity to make his name.<br>
<br>Auchmuty used his whole force to attack the walled city of Montevideo. He made an opposed landing, defeated a large sortie (having a horse shot under him), and mounted a siege. Resistance was strong, a relieving force was approaching, and stocks of powder were soon almost exhausted. A small breach in the city wall was perforce deemed practicable, and on the night of 2&#150;3 February 1807 it was stormed. The cost was high but the city was taken. Auchmuty took especial pride in noting that the British troops kept their discipline; within hours the life of the city had returned to normal.<br>
<br>Auchmuty did not have sufficient men to attack Buenos Aires but a detachment took Colonia and so he gained control of the whole north coast. He was then succeeded in command by Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke, who took the whole force to attack Buenos Aires. Auchmuty commanded the left wing of the attack and reached all his objectives but other units were destroyed or captured. He fully agreed that Whitelocke was correct in giving up the assault but his opinion on Whitelocke's decision to evacuate Montevideo is not known&#151;although he is recorded as having spent much of the voyage to Britain drinking hard.<br>
<br>Given the thanks of parliament for Montevideo, on his return to Britain Auchmuty was promoted major-general and made colonel of the 103rd foot. In 1810 he went back to India as commander-in-chief at Madras, a delicate post for many in the Madras army were disaffected, following the &#145;white mutiny&#146; against the authority of the governor, Sir George Barlow. Auchmuty insisted on the local rank of lieutenant-general to enhance his authority but his correspondence is full of apprehensions about the state of feeling among his officers; he insisted on receiving written expressions of loyalty from them.<br>
<br>The governor-general, Lord Minto, planned to eliminate all enemy bases in the Indian Ocean. The Cape was taken in 1806 and Auchmuty was intended to command the expedition to take Mauritius and Bourbon but when Minto sent the expedition off before he arrived Auchmuty graciously withdrew his claim. Minto then organized an expedition to take Java from the Dutch, and this Auchmuty commanded.<br>
<br>The Dutch had assembled a formidable defence force but Auchmuty got his troops ashore at Chillingching, east of the capital, Batavia, without interference and the city fell without a fight. The Dutch forces were entrenched at Cornelis, a few miles south, a well-fortified position. Auchmuty organized assaults from all directions, one of which, under Colonel Rollo Gillespie, broke into the fort. A relentless pursuit destroyed the Dutch army as a fighting force; three weeks later the capture of Samarang and the surrender of the Dutch governor, General Janssens, ended the fighting.<br>
<br>Auchmuty returned to Madras in October 1811 and to Britain in 1813, where his local rank of lieutenant-general was made full. He received the thanks of parliament for Java, was made GCB, and was given the colonelcy of the 78th foot. The prize money from Java made him independently wealthy. His final post, from 1821, was commander-in-chief in Ireland. Riding in Phoenix Park, Dublin, on 11 August 1822 he fell dead from his horse; he was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. He never married; his heirs were his nephews and nieces.<br>
