<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, third earl of Northumberland  (1421&#150;1461), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21933/', "Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (1394&#150;1455)")</script>, and Eleanor, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland (d. 1425)")</script>. He was born on 25 July 1421 at the Percy manor of Leconfield, Yorkshire. With his father a member of Henry VI's minority council, he was knighted on 19 May 1426 along with the young king. The second earl and his kinsman, Cardinal Beaufort, secured for him (<i>c</i>.1434) the marriage of Eleanor (1428&#150;1484), granddaughter and heir of Robert Poynings, fourth Baron Poynings. When Poynings died in 1446 Percy acquired (16 November) the baronies of Poynings, Fitzpayn, and Brian, with estates in Kent, Sussex, East Anglia, and Somerset; henceforward he was known as Lord Poynings. On 1 April 1440 he assumed responsibility for the east march towards Scotland (which his father shouldered until 1434) and custody of Berwick, and his commission was periodically renewed until his death. He was assigned substantial fees and wages&#151;&pound;2500 per annum in peacetime and &pound;5000 per annum in wartime, with an annual sum for Berwick's upkeep (100 marks in peacetime and &pound;200 in wartime)&#151;though securing payment was not easy. With his father he defended the north against Scottish incursions, and in May 1448 invaded Scotland with Sir Robert Ogle and burnt Dunbar; the Scots retaliated by burning his father's castles at Alnwick and Warkworth. Later that year Henry VI travelled to Durham and dispatched Poynings to Dumfriesshire, but he was forced to retreat and was taken prisoner near the River Sark. On regaining his freedom he was recompensed for his ransom with half the goods of Sir Robert Ogle, now an outlaw. In April and July 1451 he was commissioned to negotiate with the Scots and in August became one of the conservators of a truce. In July 1452 he was granted the fee farm (&pound;80 per annum) of Carlisle for twenty years, but in August 1454 the grant was transferred to Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury. By then Poynings was embroiled in his family's violent dispute with the Nevilles in Yorkshire where, at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, he and his father assembled a force to confront Salisbury and his family. This seems to have been Poynings's first overt participation in the feud. By February 1454 he was reported to be planning to attend parliament with a strong force, and on 10 May he and his father were summoned to the council probably in an effort to prevent further lawlessness and a rising in Yorkshire by the duke of Exeter and Poynings's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50235/', "Thomas Percy, Baron Egremont")</script>.<br>
<br>His father's death at the battle of St Albans in May 1455 meant that Poynings inherited the earldom of Northumberland and, in view of his loyal service to Henry VI, he was allowed to enter his lands without payment of relief. He returned to the north, and in July 1455 foiled James II's attack on Berwick. Indeed, his duties in northern England meant that, later in the year, he was excused from attending parliament. But in January 1456 the delicate political situation that led to the ending of the duke of York's protectorate required his presence in London. A year later he joined the king and his court at Coventry, where he was confirmed as warden of the east march. With a substantial force and accompanied by his brother, Egremont, he attended the great council that assembled in London in January 1458 to reconcile the leading magnates. The Londoners were reluctant to allow large Lancastrian retinues into the city and Northumberland's was refused entry. Nevertheless, he took part in the formal reconciliation on 25 March: the greatest concessions were made by the Nevilles and the duke of York; Northumberland and Egremont concluded a bond with them for &pound;8000. He attended the Coventry parliament in 1459 that accused York of causing the death of Northumberland's father at St Albans; Northumberland himself swore to uphold the Lancastrian dynasty. In the face of continued Scottish threats, efforts were made in the late 1450s to ensure that Northumberland was paid his fees and wages as warden, and as a Lancastrian stalwart he was more successful than Salisbury on the west march in securing payment, including part of his accumulated arrears of &pound;17,000. He also recovered, in November 1459, the Carlisle fee farm after Salisbury was attainted, and received an annuity of 100 marks from York's forfeited lordship of Wakefield, Yorkshire. For his services against the rebels, presumably at Ludford Bridge, he was rewarded, on 22 December 1459, with a life appointment as chief forester north of the Trent and constable of Scarborough Castle. On 30 May 1460 he was nominated to a wide-ranging commission of oyer and terminer to deal with all treasons and insurrections in Northumberland; a few days later he secured a twelve-year lease of Salisbury's estates in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cambridgeshire. In the last years of his reign Henry VI relied on Northumberland to defend and control northern England, at the expense of York's and the Nevilles' power. Nevertheless, it was costly loyalty, for the Percy estates, especially in the north, had been declining in value for decades, and although the debt to him as warden had been reduced, it still stood at about &pound;12,000 in 1461.<br>
<br>The Yorkist regime established after Henry VI's capture at Northampton in July 1460 tried to wrest the grants of forfeited property from Northumberland; and in October he was ordered to appear in chancery accused of looting York's and Salisbury's estates; following a meeting with his allies, lords Clifford and Dacre, at York in November 1460, further plundering of these Yorkist lands took place. York himself marched north against Northumberland: at a skirmish near Wakefield on 30 December 1460 the duke and his second son, Rutland, were killed, and Salisbury was beheaded immediately after. Northumberland proceeded to help Queen Margaret to raise an army, and he marched south with her, plundering along the way. They defeated the earl of Warwick and recaptured Henry VI at St Albans on 17 February 1461; but then, having failed to gain immediate entry to London, they retired north to York. Northumberland seems to have been in joint command of the army that then turned to confront the new monarch, Edward IV, at Towton on 29 March. In the battle Northumberland commanded the van, but his archers were blinded by snowstorms. The Lancastrians were defeated and Northumberland was killed in close fighting. He was probably later buried in the church of St Denis, York. In Edward IV's first parliament he was posthumously attainted (4 November). By 1469 the Percys were striving to restore their honour and reassemble their estates, but it was only when his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21935/', "Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland")</script>, petitioned the parliament of 1472 that Northumberland's attainder was reversed.<br>
