<span class="headword">Pether,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1738&#150;1821), <span class="occ">mezzotint engraver and painter</span>, one of the three sons and two daughters of William Pether (<i>d</i>. 1781), an organ and harpsichord builder, and his wife, Mary, was born at Carlisle. He became a pupil of the artist and porcelain manufacturer Thomas Frye of Bow, Middlesex. Between 1756 and 1762 he won four prizes for drawing and two for mezzotints from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. He became Frye's partner in 1761 and in the following year he engraved Frye's portrait of George III in three sizes. Pether regarded himself as a painter, and it was in that capacity that in 1765 he was elected a foundation fellow of the Incorporated Society of Artists; he served as a director in 1771&#150;2 and 1773&#150;4. Between 1761 and 1780 he exhibited crayon paintings of portraits and fancy heads, together with portrait miniatures and occasional mezzotints. He continued to exhibit portraits and other heads with the Royal Academy in 1781&#150;3, 1789, and 1793&#150;4. Although he presented himself as a candidate for election as ARA in 1781, he failed resoundingly, both then and again in 1783, to find support among the academicians.<br>
<br>Pether's mezzotints have survived better than his crayon paintings, and it is on mezzotint that his enduring reputation is based. In 1763 John Boydell published Pether's first print after Rembrandt, <span class="italic">Rembrandt's Wife in the Character of a Jew Bride</span>. This was the first of nine mezzotints of Rembrandt's paintings, executed for Boydell, or occasionally on his own account. The print called <span class="italic">A Jew Rabbi</span> (1764, now thought to represent Uzziah struck with leprosy), was well reviewed in the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> and was selected by William Gilpin in <span class="italic">An Essay on Prints</span> (1768) to exemplify the excellence of contemporary mezzotint. The mastery of the distribution of light that made Pether such a fine interpreter of Rembrandt was perfectly suited to the work of Joseph Wright of Derby, and Pether scraped a series of fine mezzotints after Wright, with whom he seems also to have enjoyed a close friendship. <span class="italic">A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery</span> (1768), <span class="italic">Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight</span> (1769), <span class="italic">A Farrier's Shop</span> (1771), <span class="italic">An Academy</span> (1772), and Pether's three other mezzotints after Wright are among the finest produced in Britain. Pether published the majority of his own plates, the remainder being issued by Boydell. Very few were portraits, but he interpreted a variety of subjects by English, Dutch, and Italian masters.<br>
<br>Pether's pupils included Robert Dunkarton, Edward Dayes, and Henry Edridge, and he employed the crippled dwarf John Jehner as an assistant. Edward Dayes found Pether &#145;a kind master, and polite gentleman&#146;, considering his rare oil portraits &#145;painted with a firm, broad pencil and great force of light and shade&#146;, his landscapes &#145;tolerable&#146;, and his miniatures &#145;clear, firm and spirited&#146;. On the strength of his interpretations of Rembrandt and Wright, Dayes reckoned that in mezzotint he was &#145;unquestionably the first&#146;  (Dayes, 343&#150;4). Miller considered Pether &#145;amiable, but an unsteady and unfortunate man &hellip; he wanted <i>stability</i> in his pursuits; this defect in his nature rendered abortive the application of his excellent abilities&#146;  (Miller, 125).<br>
<br>Pether lived at various addresses in the Soho and Bloomsbury areas of London, and from the mid-1770s he also had a home in Church Row, Richmond. He was in Nottingham in 1780. His last plate published in London was dated 1793, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy for the last time in 1794. About ten years later he had settled at Bristol and was working as a drawing-master and cleaner of pictures; while there, he engraved the portraits of Samuel Seyer, the historian of Bristol (1816), and Edward Colston the philanthropist (1817), after Richardson. He died, aged eighty-two, in Montague Street, Bristol, on 19 July 1821, and was buried on 27 July in the churchyard at Horfield, where Seyer was rector. Elizabeth Pether, who was buried there on 25 June 1833 aged eighty-four, was possibly his widow.<br>
