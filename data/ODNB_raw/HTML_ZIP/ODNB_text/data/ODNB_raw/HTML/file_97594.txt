<span class="headword">Hall,  Willis Edward</span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 6 April 1929 at 20 Addington Street, Hunslet, Leeds, the only son and elder child of Walter Hall, an engineer's fitter, and his wife, Gladys, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbon. Raised in the back-to-back terraces of Hunslet&#151;when his first West End director, the aesthetic Lindsay Anderson, paid a visit to his old home in the interests of research he found himself &#145;stranded in a world I had no relationship with&#146;  (Anderson, 68)&#151;he was educated at local council schools then Cockburn High School. He thereafter drifted through a variety of dead-end jobs&#151;as factory worker, trawler hand, and amusement park attendant, most of which were to serve him well when he turned to writing for television&#151;until, anticipating national service, he volunteered for the regular army. In due course he found himself serving as a signals corporal in Malaya. Having dabbled with writing for radio at home, he now passed the time by composing plays for Chinese children on Radio Malaya&#151;a useful writer's discipline in that he was confined to an English vocabulary of about fifty words.<br>
<br>On leaving the army, Hall settled in Nottingham, where he established himself as a scriptwriter for the BBC, and on 16 September 1954 married Kathleen May (Kay) Cortens, who ran the secretarial agency that typed up his early scripts. A 32-year-old divorcee, she was the daughter of William Edis, civil servant. Establishing himself at once in the pattern he was to continue all through his working life, Hall rented an office in a commercial block and from there worked a nine-to-five day. He began by writing radio plays, but soon moved on to television. The mid-1950s was the beginning of the golden age of the single television play, and Hall, with his command of what he called &#145;doorstep English&#146; and his intuitive knowledge not only of how ordinary people talked but what they thought, was a natural.<br>
<br>In 1958 the television director Peter Dews invited Hall to write a stage play for eight Oxford undergraduates in a production he was taking to the Edinburgh Festival. The only proviso was that there could be but one entrance and exit, owing to the limitations of the hall. It was just the kind of theatrical problem that appealed to Hall. He gave Dews a play called <span class="italic">The Disciplines of War</span>, which accommodated the restrictions imposed upon it by being claustrophobically set in the Malayan jungle, where half a dozen squaddies, plus a Japanese prisoner, await the inevitable onslaught by the enemy. The play was enthusiastically received in Edinburgh and transferred first to the Royal Court Theatre and then the New Theatre under a title, <span class="italic">The Long and the Short and the Tall</span>, provided by its London director, Lindsay Anderson. Described by the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> critic Philip Hope-Wallace as &#145;a <span class="italic">Journey's End</span> of the Malayan war&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 9 Jan 1959), it was an instant success, propelling its leading light Peter O'Toole into stardom and its industrious young writer (who by now had some forty radio and television plays to his credit) to the ranks of the so-called &#145;new wave&#146; of writers or &#145;angry young men,&#146; as they were dubbed.<br>
<br>At about this time <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102348/', "Keith Waterhouse")</script>, an old youth club friend of Hall's from their Leeds days, was achieving some success with a new novel, <span class="italic">Billy Liar</span> (1959). Hall called him out of the blue and observed, &#145;There's a play in this just screaming to get out.&#146; Thus began a fruitful collaboration that lasted over thirty years. Starring Albert Finney and later Tom Courtenay, <span class="italic">Billy Liar</span> (1960) played for 582 performances before being taken out on a series of national tours. It was filmed by John Schlesinger (1963), with Courtenay in the leading role and Waterhall Productions Ltd, as the pair now styled themselves, providing the screenplay. It became a long-running Drury Lane musical, <span class="italic">Billy</span> (1974), starring Michael Crawford, and a television situation comedy both in Britain (1973&#150;4) and, as <span class="italic">Billy</span>, in the United States (1979).<br>
<br>With offers pouring in for Waterhall, the team, working from an office in New Bond Street, turned out a series of north-country plays of varying success, as well as situation comedies, sketches, and screenplays (starting with <span class="italic">Whistle Down the Wind</span>, 1961, and <span class="italic">A Kind of Loving</span>, 1962). They were regular contributors to Ned Sherrin's groundbreaking television satire show <span class="italic">That Was the Week That Was</span> and its successors. Wishing by now to get rid of their cloth-cap image, they wrote a middle-class comedy, <span class="italic">Say Who You Are</span> (1965). Starring Ian Carmichael and Patrick Cargill, it filled Her Majesty's Theatre for fifteen months, before transferring to the Vaudeville and then proceeding on an extended post-West End tour. Meanwhile Waterhall, among other enterprises, had two long-running television series in the pipeline&#151;<span class="italic">Budgie</span> (1971&#150;2), starring Adam Faith, and <span class="italic">Worzel Gummidge</span> (1979&#150;81), with Jon Pertwee.<br>
<br>Hall's first marriage ended in divorce, and he was married three more times: on 24 January 1962 to the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39924/', "(Nora Noel) Jill Bennett (1929?&#150;1990)")</script>, daughter of (James) Randle Bennett, company director; in 1966 to Dorothy Kingsmill-Lunn; and on 2 November 1973 to Valerie Shute, a 28-year-old dancer and actress, and daughter of Alfred Shute, advertising director. His second and third marriages ended in divorce, but his fourth lasted until his death. In all he had four sons.<br>
<br>After three non-stop decades the Waterhall machine was beginning to slow down, and Hall and Waterhouse agreed to pursue separate projects, though they remained close friends. Hall, with his wife Valerie, settled in the West Riding of Yorkshire and devoted himself to writing children's books&#151;he wrote about twenty, between <span class="italic">The Royal Astrologer</span> (1960) and <span class="italic">Vampire Island</span> (1999)&#151;the occasional stage musical adaptation, and his hobby of magic. He was a member of the Magic Circle and the International Brotherhood of Magicians, as well as the magicians' societies of the United States and Malta. He died at his home in Ghyll Mews, Ilkley, on 7 March 2005, of cancer of the oesophagus, leaving his wife Valerie and four sons. A celebration of his life and work was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 6 November 2005.<br>
