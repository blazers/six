<span class="headword">Blackwall,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1672, <em>d.</em> 1730), <span class="occ">classical scholar and schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 17 July 1672 at Kirk Ireton, Derbyshire, the son of Anthony Blackwall, of Blackwall, a hamlet in that parish. His sister Elizabeth was also baptized there, on 11 May 1674. Having been educated at Derby grammar school he was admitted sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 13 September 1690; he graduated BA in 1695 and proceeded MA in 1698. In 1697 he was appointed headmaster of Derby grammar school and lecturer of All Saints', Derby. He was presented to the vicarage of Elvaston, Derbyshire, in 1699, and held it until 1723.<br>
<br>Blackwall was twice married. He and his first wife, whose maiden name was Toplis, had one son, Anthony, who graduated BA from Emmanuel College in 1722. His second wife was the widow of Thomas Cantrell (1649&#150;1698), who was Blackwall's predecessor at Derby School. They had four sons and one daughter: Henry (<i>d</i>. 1728), fellow of Emmanuel College; Robert (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1704), a dragoon; John (<i>bap</i>. 1707, <i>d</i>. 1762), attorney at Stoke Golding; William (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1708), who died young; and Mary, who married John Pickering on 20 September 1733.<br>
<br>Blackwall established his credentials as a classical scholar in 1706, when he published an edition of the verse of Theognis, with a translation into Latin; it was prefaced by an address in Greek to Joshua Barnes, professor of Greek at Oxford. His next work, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Classics</span> (1718), was written for his pupils and proved to have a long shelf-life; it reached a sixth edition in 1746 and was reissued with additions by William Mavor, schoolmaster at Woodstock, as <span class="italic">Blackwall's Introduction to the Classics</span> in 1809.<br>
<br>In 1722 Blackwall was appointed headmaster of Market Bosworth grammar school, in Leicestershire, and he brought with him his assistant master from Derby, the Revd John Bradbury. He immediately set about expanding the school. A new gable and penthouse was built over the street door in 1723 and the number of pupils rose to an average of seventy. Among his pupils were Richard Dawes, classicist, and Sir Henry Atkins, who presented him to the rectory of Clapham on 12 October 1726. At both Derby and Market Bosworth Blackwall taught from his own Latin grammar, which he was prevailed upon to publish, albeit anonymously, in 1728 as <span class="italic">A new Latin grammar: being a short, clear, and easy introduction of young scholars to the knowledge of the Latin tongue</span>. His grammar was poorly regarded by Samuel Johnson, who said of him that &#145;By endeavouring to make the rules of Grammar more simple than was possible, he has only shown that the &#147;easier any subject is in its own nature, the harder it is to make it more easy by explanation&#148;&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.133).<br>
<br>There was an equally mixed critical reception to Blackwall's final work, <span class="italic">The sacred classics defended and illustrated, or, An essay humbly offered towards proving the purity, propriety, and true eloquence of the writers of the New Testament</span> (2 pts, 1725). Praised by Philip Doddridge and Thomas Hartwell Horne, its detractors included Edward Bickersteth, William Orme, and Samuel Clarke. John Gilbert Cooper dismissed Blackwall's pretensions to lasting literary merit when he wrote that he was:<blockquote>grammatically master of the two dead languages, Greek and Latin, and had <i>read over</i> all the ancient authors in both; but, not having by nature of acquisition that happy taste of distinguishing beauties, nor a digestion to assimilate the sense of others into his own understanding, his conceptions were as crude as his address and style were unpleasing. (ibid., 1.131)</blockquote>Blackwall's second wife had died by 8 June 1728, when he drew up his final will. He was revising the second volume of <span class="italic">The Sacred Classics</span> until within a few weeks of his death, at the schoolhouse in Market Bosworth on 8 April 1730.<br>
