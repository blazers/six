<span class="headword">Gater <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rogers]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1605, <em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was baptized on 19 June 1605 in the parish of St Michael, Cornhill, London, the daughter of John Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1615), a clothworker, of Whitechapel, and his wife, Elizabeth. Sarah's share of her father's estate was an annuity of &pound;8 for twenty-one years. She married, on an unknown date, William Gater (<i>d</i>. 1624), who had been admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1612, and graduated BA in 1616 and MA in 1619; he was ordained in 1616. Gater was lecturer at St Andrew Undershaft and a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company, by redemption dated 18 February 1623. The couple had one son, William, who died abroad in 1646. Widowed in her nineteenth year, Sarah Gater carried on a retail trade in her deceased husband's company until her own death. During her brief marriage she lived in Leadenhall Street in the parish of St Andrew Undershaft, but by at least 1630 she had moved to the parish of St Michael, Cornhill. There she established a modest residence and business, with several female servants, one or two apprentices, and, by the time of her death, one journeyman clothworker. Although never prosperous, she was a &#145;subsidyman&#146;, and was in 1642 rated at &pound;10 as the contribution of one-twentieth of her estate for the parliamentary wartime assessment. At her death she owned her residence and held a lease of a garden situated in the parish of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. She appears to have outlived all five of her brothers, possibly as early as 1625, when she was appointed administrator for the estate of her deceased brother Peter; this act suggests her own leading role within her family at a youthful age. The first apprentice she took on in her own right as a widow was Gerrard Winstanley (1609&#150;1676), bound on 25 March 1630, the future leader of the Diggers: Winstanley took his company freedom on 21 February 1638.<br>
<br>Sarah Gater was an educated individual. Her will of 14 September 1654 demonstrated a keen interest in medicine and theology. She owned both books and manuscript &#145;notes&#146; on physic and surgery (which she passed on in matriarchal succession to her widowed sister), although the only volume cited by name was an edition of the popular <span class="italic">Herbal</span> by John Gerard. In addition to her own holdings in divinity, she acquired, and retained to her death, a large proportion of the library of her relative Henry Mason BD, rector of St Andrew Undershaft and prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral, possibly secured in 1641 when Mason departed London for his native Wigan. Before the civil war Gater was apparently an Anglican, probably influenced by Mason, in whose parish she had resided as a married teenager, from whom she received her treasured <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and with whom she remained close. He was an orthodox divine who owed his ecclesiastical preferment, and acknowledged an intellectual debt, to Bishop John King of London.<br>
<br>Gater was buried on 16 April 1656 in the churchyard of St Michael, Cornhill. The cause of death was given as &#145;aged&#146;. One overseer of her will was her &#145;dear cousin&#146; the poet and religious biographer Izaak Walton, of Worston Place, Staffordshire. In the absence of business or personal papers, much of Gater's life remains obscure. None the less, she is of interest for maintaining a commercial concern over three decades, her learning, and her intersection with some of the most original intellects of the seventeenth century, figures as distinctive and contrasting as Winstanley and Walton. Surrounded by a number of female and male friends and relatives, and employing in her establishment kin of both sexes, she reveals the lifestyle and intellectual interests of a woman who achieved economic and domestic independence following the early separation by death from father, husband, and male siblings.<br>
