<span class="headword">Owen, Sir  (Arthur) David Kemp</span>  (1904&#150;1970), <span class="occ">international civil servant</span>, was born at Pontypool, Monmouthshire, on 26 November 1904, the eldest son of the Revd Edward Owen, Baptist minister, of Pontypool, and his wife, Gertrude Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kemp. He was educated at Leeds grammar school and the University of Leeds, from which he received an honours degree in economics (1926) and the master of commerce degree (1929), the latter for a thesis, &#145;The problem of juvenile unemployment&#146;. Between his first and second degrees he was assistant lecturer in economics at Huddersfield Technical College. He was then director of the Sheffield social survey committee from 1929 to 1933, and was responsible for producing reports on unemployment, the standard of living, and housing in Sheffield. This work was followed by appointments as secretary of the civic research division of political and economic planning (PEP) (1933&#150;6), co-director of the Pilgrim Trust unemployment inquiry (1936&#150;7), and Stevenson lecturer in citizenship at the University of Glasgow (1937&#150;40). In 1940 he published his survey, <span class="italic">The British Social Services</span>. Meanwhile, on 11 November 1933 he had married Elizabeth Joyce Morgan, daughter of the Revd E. H. Morgan, Methodist minister. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1941 Owen relinquished the post of general secretary of PEP, to which he had been appointed in the previous year, to become personal assistant to the lord privy seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, on his mission to India. He remained with Cripps following the latter's transfer to the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but in 1944 was transferred to the reconstruction department of the Foreign Office, where he served as officer in charge of League of Nations affairs. He was a member of the United Kingdom delegation to the conference on international organization at San Francisco in 1945, and when the preparatory commission of the United Nations was being organized in London in the summer of 1945, he joined the United Nations staff as its first recruit, in the capacity of deputy executive secretary of the preparatory commission.<br>
<br>When the preparatory commission gave way to the United Nations itself and the organization moved to New York in early 1946, Owen was appointed assistant secretary-general in charge of economic affairs, one of the eight top officials of the organization. In the late 1940s the organization became increasingly concerned with economic development, and in August 1951 Owen became the first executive chairman of the Technical Assistance Board, a position which he retained until in January 1966 the Expanded Programme of the Technical Assistance Board merged with the United Nations Development Fund to form the United Nations Development Programme. He became co-administrator of the programme with Paul G. Hoffman, a post which he retained until his retirement from the United Nations service in 1969. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, in 1950 he married Elisabeth Elsa Miller, the adopted daughter of Frieda Segelke Miller, American labour official and director of the women's bureau of the US department of labor (1944&#150;53). They had two sons.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Owen was essentially a pioneer in new areas of public service, first on the national and later on the international level. He relished new challenges, and his enquiring mind and his skill as a pragmatic and informal administrator admirably equipped him to meet them. He was a non-doctrinaire socialist of the old school with a quiet faith in the capacity of humanity to improve its condition and an ardent desire to help it to do so. His work in social and economic planning in the post-depression years and his service with Sir Stafford Cripps during the war led naturally to strong convictions about the need for international co-operation, convictions upon which he acted in the most challenging circumstances when helping to build and operate the institutional structure of the United Nations. He was one of the younger architects of the new world organization from San Francisco and thenceforth, and had an almost unique record of being associated with the creation of successive new branches on the economic side&#151;first the economic department itself and its regional economic commissions, then the Technical Assistance Board, and finally the fully fledged United Nations Development Programme, which became by far the largest and most far-flung operation of the United Nations.<br>
<br>Owen was an idealist and enthusiast of a practical and realistic kind. In the emergent international civil service he found a perfect setting for his convictions. He wrote:<blockquote>It is, after all, a fine thing to belong to a service which, whatever its failings and frustrations, is engaged in the practical business of trying to establish more effective forms of international co-operation in the pursuit of peace and human well-being.</blockquote>His concept of the United Nations was that of an activist, although he was very much aware of the shortcomings and difficulties of the world organization. &#145;It remains to be seen&#146;, he wrote in 1966, &#145;whether we can rise to the historic occasion or whether we will find ourselves stagnating with modest usefulness in the margin of great events&#146;.<br>
<br>Owen was modest, unpretentious, quick-witted, and of an enquiring turn of mind. Small in stature, with the humour and a touch of the accent of his native Wales, he was a dominant influence in the formative years of the United Nations. His kindness, consideration, and interest in the careers of his colleagues, especially the young and intelligent, greatly influenced the early stages of organization. Later, when he was responsible for setting up the worldwide network of resident representatives of the technical assistance programme, which became the basis of the development programme, his ability to find new and promising recruits had a major effect on the development of the United Nations. His method of leadership was very personal. He was a voracious reader, which prevented him from becoming stale or bureaucratic. He never lost the simplicity and natural friendliness of his youth and was a much beloved colleague.<br>
<br>On his retirement from the United Nations service, Owen was appointed secretary-general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in succession to Sir Colville Deverell. His tenure was short-lived, as he died at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 29 June 1970, following a heart attack, very shortly after being appointed KCMG. He had also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Leeds (1954) and Wales (1969). He was survived by his second wife, Elisabeth, and his four children.<br>
