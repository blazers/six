<span class="headword">George</span> <span class="st"> [St George]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>303?), <span class="occ">patron saint of England</span>, is a figure whose historicity cannot be established with certainty. However, an inscription at Shaqqa in the Hauran, in the south-west of present-day Syria, which commemorates &#145;the holy and triumphant martyrs, George and the saints who [suffered martyrdom] with him&#146;  (Budge, 16), and which can be plausibly dated to the mid-fourth century, bears witness to the existence of a cult by that time, while the fact that the name George, from the Greek word for peasant or farmer, is not known to occur before the fourth century, makes it impossible to date the origins of that cult to the third century or earlier. It therefore seems very likely that there was a martyr George, and that he suffered in the persecution of Christians which began on the orders of Diocletian in 303. But later efforts to identify him with the unnamed man who according to Eusebius was executed after tearing down the decree in which the emperor proscribed Christianity, and to locate his martyrdom at Nicomedia, where this act of defiance took place, rest on pure speculation. The earliest locus for George's cult was Diospolis or Lydda, present-day Lod, in Palestine, where it was flourishing by the early sixth century.<br>
<br>By the last quarter of the fifth century the story of George, however it had first been told, had been subjected to a fantastical hagiographical elaboration, which itself survives in several forms. Shared elements are George's occupation as an army officer, his defiance of paganism and its representatives, up to and including the emperor &#145;Dadianus&#146;, and his protracted sufferings for his faith, lasting for seven years. During that time he is subjected to an appalling series of torments and is killed and resurrected three times, before being finally executed by beheading. His exemplary courage and devotion prompt thousands of conversions, the empress &#145;Alexandra&#146; among them. In this highly embellished form the <i>passio</i> of George both reflected and helped to create his standing as one of the great martyr&#150;saints of the eastern Mediterranean. Further west it aroused misgivings through its sheer extravagance, and in the sixth century the Roman church, in decretals later inaccurately attributed to Gelasius I (<i>r</i>. 492&#150;6), purged the story of many of its details, attributing them to heretics, and declared that George was one of the saints who were rightly reverenced by men, but whose deeds were known only to God.<h2>
<a name="EarlycultinwesternEuropeandBritain"></a>Early cult in western Europe and Britain</h2>The intervention of Rome had little effect. No modified version of the <i>passio</i> of George is recorded in western Europe, where the saint's cult was already beginning to circulate&#151;it is recorded at several places in sixth-century Francia. Thus Gregory of Tours professed to know several stories of miracles wrought by St George, and associated two with relics preserved in the Limousin and Maine. But not until the late seventh century did accounts of George reach Britain, beginning with the arrival of the Frankish bishop Arculf on Iona about 683. Arculf had been a pilgrim in the Near East between 679 and 682, and visited Constantinople. Two miracle stories concerning St George which he heard there were recorded by Abbot Adomn&aacute;n in his <span class="italic">De locis sanctis</span>, composed shortly after Arculf's visit. Bede, who reports Adomn&aacute;n's giving a copy of his book to King Aldfrith of Northumbria, was clearly unimpressed by what it says of George, for he makes no mention of the saint in any of his works (George was added by later hands to Bede's <span class="italic">Martyrology</span>). But Willibald, a native of Wessex who visited the Holy Land in the 720s, was less critical, and in his <span class="italic">Hodoeporicon</span>, dictated in his old age as bishop of Eichst&auml;tt to the nun Hugeburc, he recorded the impact made upon him by the cult he observed at Diospolis.<br>
<br>The cult of St George seems ultimately to have spread into England from Francia rather than from Scotland, especially through the links between Benedictine monasteries. Hence the saint's commemoration in the ninth-century Old English martyrology, and in all the surviving pre-conquest kalendars; his feast day is always 23 April. In the late tenth century he appears among the saints whose lives were recorded, primarily for the benefit of monks, by &AElig;lfric of Eynsham. &AElig;lfric shows himself aware that doubts have been expressed about the cult:<blockquote>
<div>Heretics have written falsehoods in their books<br>
</div>
<div>About the holy man who is called George.<br>
</div>
<div>Now we will tell you that which is true about him.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Aelfric's Lives</span>, 307)</blockquote>But what he provides is essentially a pared-down version of the <i>passio</i> in its original form, and it was clearly this which circulated in England. George's inclusion among the saints whose lives are narrated by &AElig;lfric is only one indication how far his cult had become established in England about the end of the first millennium, in the north as well as in the south. At the beginning of the tenth century he was honoured in the Durham <i>rituale</i>. Towards its end a chapel was dedicated to him at Winchester under Bishop &AElig;thelwold, and by the mid-eleventh century there were relics of him there and at Exeter. A monastery founded at Thetford during the reign of Cnut was dedicated to St George, as was Doncaster church in 1061. The death of &AElig;thelred the Unready, on 23 April 1016, is recorded in every surviving version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> as occurring on St George's day. He was still a very long way from being in any sense a national saint, but by the time of the Norman conquest the martyr George was at least well on the way to becoming a nationally known one.<h2>
<a name="Inconsistentobservances1066c1275"></a>Inconsistent observances, 1066&#150;c.1275</h2>The cult of St George has never been confined to England. He is revered in many other countries, and not only in Christian ones. The cult which had established itself in England by the mid-eleventh century originated in the eastern Mediterranean, and it continued to develop there. By the ninth century George had become one of the great Byzantine soldier&#150;saints and, along with other holy warriors, he also came to be reverenced in that guise in western Christendom, where hitherto he had been primarily honoured as a martyr. By about 1000 there existed a German <i>ordo</i> for giving arms to a knight, who is blessed by a bishop in the names of saints Maurice, Sebastian, and George. Following the Norman conquest this enhanced cult crossed the channel. In a set of <i>laudes</i> composed at Canterbury, probably between 1084 and 1095, for the acclamation of either William I or William II, the same three saints are invoked to bring safety and victory to the English army. Orderic Vitalis records that the chaplain of Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester for the last thirty years of the eleventh century, in his efforts to reform the manners of the earl's household &#145;told them vivid stories of the conflicts of Demetrius and George, of Theodore and Sebastian, of the Theban legion and Maurice its leader, and of Eustace, supreme commander of the army and his companions, who won the crown of martyrdom in heaven&#146;  (Ordericus Vitalis, <span class="italic">Eccl. hist.</span>, 3.217).<br>
<br>This militarization of the image of St George began independently of the crusades, but is likely to have been advanced by them. Both William of Malmesbury and Orderic tell how St George was among the &#145;ancient martyrs who had been knights in their own day&#146; who were seen fighting on behalf of the crusading army at the siege of Antioch in 1098  (William of Malmesbury, <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span>, 1.639). The impression made by his intervention was given visual form very soon afterwards in the tympanum of Fordington church, Dorset, where George (the patron of the church) is shown as a mounted knight striking down Saracens with his lance, while Christian soldiers kneel in prayer, and subsequently in the wall paintings at Hardham, Sussex, datable to about 1135 and possibly made for the monks of Lewes, which represent both George's martyrdom and his exploits on behalf of the crusade. But there is little sign of a widespread cult in England at this time&#151;very few monasteries were dedicated to George in the years on either side of 1100, for instance&#151;suggesting that the impact of the crusade on his cult was ultimately ephemeral. English involvement in the third crusade in 1190&#150;92 did little to promote it. It has been claimed that it was from this time that English soldiers fought under the red cross on a white ground, identified as the banner of St George, but the chronicler Roger of Howden, who participated in the crusade, states unambiguously that it was the French soldiers who wore red crosses, and that the English had white ones. Nor is there any evidence that Richard I had a particular devotion to St George&#151;his favourite saint was St Edmund.<br>
<br>The claim that St George's day appears in a list of feasts recommended for nationwide observance drawn up in 1222 similarly rests on insecure foundations&#151;all that can confidently be said of the list is that it predates 1329. Thomas of Chobham, writing in the early thirteenth century, places St George's day among feasts of purely local celebration, and this is confirmed by the uneven record of its observance. At Osney Priory, whose canons had earlier been granted the college dedicated to St George in Oxford Castle, the saint's day was a major festival by 1238, when a serious riot was apparently sparked off by attempts to celebrate it. But a set of diocesan statutes issued for London between 1245 and 1259 names the day only as one on which it was lawful to work after mass, and in several dioceses its celebration went unremarked. That the cult still had only a limited appeal in England is also suggested by the infrequency with which the name George is recorded there, either of people or of ships. In the early south-English legendary, datable to the third quarter of the thirteenth century, the story of George's martyrdom is recounted without any nationalist <i>parti pris</i>, but with Gregory the Great it is another matter:<blockquote>
<div>Bidde we &thorn;anne &thorn;ene holie man: apostle of Engelonde<br>
</div>
<div>&thorn;at he bi-fore ihesu crist: ore neode ounder-stonde.<br>
</div> (Horstmann, 359)</blockquote>The English should pray to Gregory as their apostle, to intercede for them with Christ.<h2>
<a name="Kingshipchivalryandnationalismc12721377"></a>Kingship, chivalry, and nationalism, c.1272&#150;1377</h2>The association of St George with the English nation is indissolubly linked with the purposes of the English crown, above all in war. In the civil wars of the 1260s the soldiers in royalist armies led by the future Edward I wore red crosses (those of Simon de Montfort had white ones), and it may have been as a result of that association that in 1277 the same arms, now specifically associated with St George, were made for the pennoncels and bracers (little flags and protective armbands) of the footsoldiers and archers in Edward's armies in Wales. The banners which Edward displayed at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300 included that of St George, while three such banners were made for his son in 1322. The same cult was taken up by other members of the royal family. Edward II's cousin Thomas, earl of Lancaster, is represented standing alongside St George in the <span class="roman">Douce Hours</span> of the 1320s (Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 231), and he owned at least one relic of the saint, a bone which he gave to Thomas Beauchamp, eleventh earl of Warwick, at the latter's baptism. The young Edward III was likewise devoted to St George from the beginning of his reign. An illumination in the &#145;Milemete treatise&#146; of about 1327 (Christ Church, Oxford, MS 92) shows him receiving his shield from the saint.<br>
<br>The links he had already established with the warrior saint help explain why, in the context of the early years of the Hundred Years' War, Edward III chose St George as the spiritual focus for his military endeavours, in preference to less warlike figures such as St Edmund, St Gregory the Great, and St Edward the Confessor, who had all hitherto enjoyed the status of English national saints. In 1344 he had planned a chivalric fraternity modelled on King Arthur's Round Table, as a means of uniting his foremost magnates and soldiers in loyalty to himself. But this proposal was abandoned, to be replaced in 1348 by the Order of the Garter, a fraternity of identical purpose whose patron was to be St George. It met for the first time a year later. Its physical locus was Windsor Castle, where, significantly, the chapel of St Edward the Confessor was rededicated to St George and the Virgin. A statue of George in armour, to stand by the high altar, was paid for in February 1351. When fighting against the French at Calais in 1349, Edward is said to have drawn his sword with the words &#145;Ha Sant Edward, Ha Sant George&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 1.274), but it was the latter to whom his devotion was increasingly given. When the walls of St Stephen's chapel in Westminster Palace were redecorated about 1350, George was shown kneeling before the altar, alongside Edward and his sons. On 13 August 1351 the saint was acclaimed as &#145;the blessed George, the most invincible athlete of Christ, whose name and protection the English race invoke as that of their patron, in war especially&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1350&#150;54</i>, 127).<br>
<br>By the fourteenth century the image of George as a man of war had been reinforced by the increasing circulation of the most famous myth associated with him, that of his slaying a dragon and rescuing a princess. Yet again this had originated in the Byzantine world. The story was known in western Christendom in the late twelfth century, but owed its popularity above all to the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span> of Jacobus de Voragine, completed by 1265. It tells how George, a military tribune of Cappadocian origins and a Christian, comes to &#145;Silena&#146; in the province of &#145;Lybia&#146;, where a dragon has been terrorizing the populace. Appeased at first by offerings of sheep, it has latterly been fed men and women as well, chosen by lot, which has now fallen on the king's daughter. George arrives in time to defeat the dragon, and tells the princess to lead it into the city, where he promises to kill it if the people become Christians. They do, their former scourge is dispatched, and George departs, to undergo his protracted martyrdom. The addition enriched the symbolism of George's cult by presenting his victory as a clear-cut analogy for the victory of good over evil, the latter being equally easily identified with foes spiritual or earthly. The point was explicitly made in the fourteenth-century English prayer which invokes George as simultaneously a martyr, albeit one pre-eminent in soldiership, and the saviour of &#145;a royal child in sorrow before the wicked dragon&#146;, and begs for deliverance from enemies visible and invisible  (BL, Arundel MS 341, fol. 19<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). The memorial brass of Sir Hugh Hastings, an experienced soldier who died in 1347 immediately after being appointed seneschal of Gascony, shows him spearing a humanoid figure with a dragon's head. Loyalty, familiarity, and national feeling all served to promulgate George's cult. By the 1330s ships were coming to be named after the saint in south- and east-coast ports. Froissart several times records how English forces went into battle in France or Spain under the banner of St George and with such war-cries as &#145;God and St George&#146; and &#145;St George for Guienne&#146;. Fraternities and guilds were dedicated to the saint. Tellingly, a guild was founded at Chichester in 1368 &#145;to the honour of the holy Trinity and of its glorious martyr George, protector and patron of England&#146;  (Dawson, 16&#150;17).<h2>
<a name="Thedefenderofthecrownandnation13771536"></a>The defender of the crown and nation, 1377&#150;1536</h2>From the late fourteenth century the observance of the cult of St George in England steadily intensified. This was a development found at every level of society, including the topmost, for St George remained the patron of the monarchy and of the activities associated with it. It was on St George's day 1377 that the elderly Edward III knighted his heir apparent, Richard of Bordeaux. However, Richard II seldom aspired to military glory, and his attitude to the saint who had become so closely linked with English prowess on the battlefield seems to have been ambivalent and unconventional. By 1384 the relic collection at Windsor contained part of an arm of St George, in a silver-plated reliquary which was repaired in October 1388, and in 1394 repairs were carried out on &#145;a table on which is painted the story of St George&#146;  (Bond, 97). But although the king of Aragon had reported a year earlier that a Gascon adventurer had obtained the saint's head at Levadhia in central Greece, and hoped to sell it to King Richard, if he did approach the English king no sale resulted. Richard seems to have been more interested in the red cross of St George, which he saw as a symbol of the nation, and one which could in turn be identified with himself. When he prepared for his only large-scale military venture, an invasion of Scotland in 1385, every soldier was ordered to wear &#145;un signe des armes de seint George large&#146;  (Twiss, 1.456), and ninety-two standards of St George accompanied the army. When Richard faced rebellion at the end of 1387, his troops fought under &#145;the royal standard and that of St George&#146;  (Hector and Harvey, 221&#150;3). Most strikingly of all, in the Wilton diptych of the late 1390s, one of the angels surrounding the Virgin and Child before whom Richard kneels holds the red cross flag, surmounted by a tiny orb on which is painted an island representing Britain.<br>
<br>Richard II's idiosyncratic linking of national cult with an unusually pacific style of kingship may have aroused discontent, or at any rate raised eyebrows. No sooner had he been deposed than on 6 October 1399 the clergy petitioned Archbishop Thomas Arundel for the nationwide observance of the feast of St George, &#145;who is the spiritual patron of the whole soldiery of England&#146;  (Wilkins, 3.241). Under the Lancastrian kings, and especially under Henry V, there was no danger of the saint's losing his associations with war. At the battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415 Henry is said to have ordered his men to attack with the cry &#145;In the name of Almyghti God and Saynt George avaunt banarer! and Saynt George, this day thyn help!&#146; and stories circulated afterwards that the saint had &#145;halpe hym to fighte, and was seyne aboven in the eyre, that day they faught&#146;  (Brie, 2.337&#150;8, 557). On the king's return to London a statue of George formed part of the pageants which greeted him, while on 4 January 1416 Archbishop Chichele ordered that throughout the southern province the feast of St George should be a &#145;greater double&#146;, a day on which no one should work, as that of &#145;the special patron and protector of the said nation &hellip; by whose intervention, we unhesitatingly believe, the army of the English nation is directed against enemy attacks in time of wars&#146;  (<span class="italic">Register of Henry Chichele</span>, 3.9). In 1422 the northern province followed suit, with even more fervent praise for the saint as military intercessor. Meanwhile, in 1416 the emperor Sigismund had visited England, bringing with him as a gift for King Henry the heart of St George, which Henry had kept at Windsor, and where it featured prominently in Garter processions. The emperor also gave a portion of the saint's skull. In 1419 it was ordered that all Frenchmen in conquered Normandy must proclaim their submission by wearing the cross of St George. Banners of St George were prominent at Henry's exequies three years later.<br>
<br>Henry V's brother, John, duke of Bedford, was no less devoted to St George. He owned relics and images of him, and is represented in his book of hours kneeling before the saint, who wears the robes and other insignia of the Order of the Garter. Other Englishmen who fought in fifteenth-century France similarly reverenced George. A book of hours prepared for Sir William Oldhall, who served there almost continuously between 1415 and the mid-1440s, shows him and his wife kneeling on either side of the dragon-slaying saint, while an anonymous poet commemorating Robert, sixth Baron Willoughby of Eresby, who likewise fought long and hard in France, acclaims him, too, as an ardent devotee of St George:<blockquote>
<div>Now holy St George, myne only avower,<br>
</div>
<div>In whom I trust for my protection;<br>
</div>
<div>O very Chevalier of the stourished Flower<br>
</div>
<div>By whose Hands thy Sword and Shield hast wone.<br>
</div> (Dugdale, 2.85&#150;6)</blockquote>By the time Willoughby died, in 1452, the English conquests in France had been almost entirely lost under the unwarlike Henry VI. The latter, despite his military incompetence, also cultivated St George. He spent no less than 2000 marks on &#145;a tabernacle w<sup>t</sup> an image of Seynt George of gold garnysshed w<sup>t</sup> dyvers stonys &amp; perles&#146;  (Palgrave, 102), and in 1458 had an image of George on horseback made for St George's Chapel, Windsor. But the fact that Henry was no warrior may have fostered the development of another side of St George's cult, one foreshadowed in the devotions of Richard II. Not only was he a supernatural associate in foreign war, his links with the monarchy also made him a plausible upholder of another of the king's responsibilities, namely the well-being of the nation at home. John Lydgate, writing about 1430, acclaimed George as:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">protectour and patroun,<br>
</div>
<div>&thorn;is hooly martir, of knighthood loodsterre,<br>
</div>
<div>To Englisshe men boo&thorn;e in pees and werre.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Minor Poems</span>, 145)</blockquote>An anonymous fifteenth-century Latin hymn, addressing George as the glorious knight who is protector of England, calls on him &#145;graciously to cause those at variance to be brought back to concord&#146;&#151;possibly a reference to the Wars of the Roses but more likely, since the hymn also alludes to the &#145;clamorous populace&#146;, to disturbances like that led by Jack Cade  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Arch. Selden B.26). As government crumbled, the saint's intercession was coming to be looked for in England rather than in France.<br>
<br>The Yorkists who deposed Henry VI were no less fervent in their reverence for St George, whose cult was perceived as a valuable prop for monarchic authority. Although the name George was never widely used in medieval England, Edward IV's younger brother bore it, as did one of Edward's own sons. Edward himself was a lavish patron of the Order of the Garter, financing the building of a magnificent new chapel of St George at Windsor, and making provision for his own burial there. Unlike his predecessor, moreover, he seems to have seen George as a saint who might be called upon for victory in battle, so that when fighting to recover the throne in 1471 he could be plausibly described as appealing &#145;To oure lady and to saynt George, and other seyntes moo&#146;  (Wright, 275). When Prince Edward, the future Edward V, visited Coventry in 1476 he was greeted by pageants which included one of St George and the dragon, in which the saint claimed for himself and the Virgin &#145;proteccion perpetual&#146; of England, &#145;Hit to defende from enemies ferre &amp; nere&#146;  (Bulley, 25&#150;6). St George had remained the protector of England, and he had clearly also recovered all his former militancy. In his translation of the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>, published in 1483, William Caxton describes the saint as &#145;patrone of this royame of Englonde and the crye of men of warre&#146;, and concludes with the injunction: &#145;Thenne let us praye unto hym that he be specyall protector and defensor of this royame&#146;  (Barclay, 118).<br>
<br>The broadening of the cult of St George, to serve the cause of domestic peace as well as of continental war, was maintained under the Tudors. Henry VII claimed the protection of the saint from the very beginning of his reign (the red-cross banner was one of three under which his victorious army entered London in 1485) and he had visible form given to George's protection for his dynasty, in the panel from an altarpiece which survives in the Royal Collection, showing Henry and his queen kneeling in prayer, flanked by their children, while behind them St George overthrows the dragon. When he visited Hereford in 1486 he was greeted by a pageant of St George, who promised to &#145;be your Helpe, unto your Lives Fine [end], To withstonde your Enemyes with the Help of that blessed Virgin&#146;  (Leland, 4.197). Though the saint was invoked for Henry's invasion of France in 1492&#151;&#145;Sent Iorge protector, be hys good gyd!&#146;  (Robbins, 96)&#151;the enemies referred to in 1486 were essentially domestic ones: dynastic rivals and unreconciled Yorkists. The disguising staged on twelfth night 1494 at Westminster, in which St George defeated &#145;a Terryble &amp; hughe Rede dragun&#146;, which &#145;spytt ffyre at hys mowth&#146;  (Streitberger, 27&#150;9), furnished, like the altarpiece panel, an obvious symbolism for Henry's pursuit of security.<br>
<br>Henry VII's devotion to St George became well known outside England. In 1504 he was presented with &#145;a legg of Seynt George inclosid in sylvyr parcellis Gylt&#146;  (Thomas and Thornley, 328&#150;9), which Louis XII of France had seized when he captured Milan four years earlier. The precious relic was given to Georges d'Amboise, cardinal-archbishop of Rouen, who in turn gave it to Henry VII, who following its arrival in England had it carried before him in procession through the streets of London. In his will Henry bequeathed it to the altar next to his tomb in the newly built lady chapel in Westminster Abbey, together with a relic of the holy cross, directing that they should be placed on the altar &#145;upon principal and solempne festes&#146;  (Condon, 132). The identification of the saint with the well-being of the monarch could be extended to advance the latter's policy. In 1495 the parliament of Ireland, in an attempt to curtail the violence provoked by that country's magnates, enacted that their retainers should no longer use such expressions as &#145;<i>Cromabo</i>, <i>Butlerabo</i>, or other words like &hellip; but to call only on St George, or the name of his Sovereign Lord the King of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Statutes &hellip; of Ireland</span>, 1.55). The saint was similarly exploited for pacific purposes in Wales, where in 1507 a magnificent tournament staged at Carew Castle by Sir Rhys ap Thomas, one of King Henry's most influential supporters, culminated with St George embracing <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7206/', "St David")</script>. Henry VII's aspirations for Anglo-Welsh co-operation could hardly have been more clearly expressed. During the early years of Henry VIII's reign, too, the saint's cult continued to serve royal ends, most notably in 1526, when the reform of the currency led to the issue of a new coin, the George noble, a gold piece which on the reverse showed George mounted and killing the dragon with his lance (another issue represented him with sword in hand). Henry also took a close interest in the Order of the Garter (he reformed its statutes), and it may have been during his reign that the practice developed whereby its members unable to be present at Windsor on 23 April observed the patronal feast in appropriate style wherever they happened to be. In the early decades of the sixteenth century the cult of St George was a significant link binding the ruling classes of England to one another and to the monarch.<h2>
<a name="Popularcultsinthelatermiddleages"></a>Popular cults in the later middle ages</h2>Where kings and nobles led, their subjects soon followed. St George did not, in fact, always appear in sanctified isolation. It is not surprising to find him associated with St Michael, as his fellow dragon-killer, for instance in paintings on the altar screen at Ransworth, Norfolk, and he is also several times referred to as linked with the Virgin, and in particular as &#145;our lady's knight&#146;, in fifteenth-century verses. This may have owed something to chivalric culture&#151;it would not be remarkable if the saint who saved a princess also came to be seen as devoted to the queen of heaven&#151;while the fact that the Virgin, too, was perceived as the defender of England, as on the Wilton diptych, may also have reinforced the connection. Nevertheless St George was increasingly seen as the principal patron of the whole nation, and not just of its ruling classes, a development reflected in late medieval illuminations showing the rebellious peasants of 1381 mustered round banners bearing the saint's arms. Such was the reverence in which those arms had come to be held that the Northumbrian chronicler John Hardyng associated them with figures from Britain's legendary past, with King Lucius, who after his conversion in 184 &#145;bare of sylver a crosse of gowles [gules] in fourme of seynt Georges armes&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 204, fol. 47<i>v</i>), and with Sir Galahad, who bore them on a shield made by Joseph of Arimathaea.<br>
<br>Meanwhile guilds like that of Chichester had begun to proliferate, particularly in East Anglia: Bury St Edmunds <i>c</i>.1369, Bishop's Lynn in 1376, Great Yarmouth and Lincoln in 1377, Littleport in 1378. The most notable of these fraternities was that of Norwich, probably founded in 1385. The Norwich guild was typical in its purposes of honouring the saint and his feast day, while offering prayers for its dead and living brothers and sisters, but was ultimately uncommon in the closeness of its ties to the government of the city. In the early fifteenth century 23 April was already marked by a long and magnificent procession in which the clergy and members of the guild were joined by an armed man representing the saint and by a representation of the dragon, the latter made as lifelike as possible; in 1429 another man received 2<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. &#145;for playing in the dragon with gunpowder&#146;  (Grace, 17). From 1452, when a dispute which had bitterly divided the citizens was resolved, the fraternity became effectively part of the government of Norwich, the St George's day celebrations a hierarchically organized expression of civic unity, involving the mayor and aldermen as well as the humbler members of the guild.<br>
<br>Elsewhere processions (often known as &#145;ridings&#146;) and plays featuring St George increasingly provided the means for expressions of communal pride and religious devotion. Although they continued to be concentrated in the south and east of England, by 1437 there were plays at Chester, by 1478 at Salisbury, by 1511 at Newcastle, and by the mid-1520s at Leicester, where one may in fact have been staged sixty years earlier. A St George's day pageant has been claimed for Dublin <i>c</i>.1490, while in Scotland the saint appeared in Corpus Christi pageants at Jedburgh after 1488, and at Aberdeen from 1530. At Jedburgh the pageants must have been largely the work of the canons of the Augustinian abbey, just as an enactment of St George and the dragon was the responsibility of the Augustinian canons at Woodbridge in Suffolk after <i>c</i>.1475. The diffusion of the cult was the work of many agencies, and its consequent spread remained geographically uneven. In London the guild of armourers received a charter in 1453 incorporating them as the guild or fraternity of St George, and in 1521 the midsummer celebrations included &#145;St George, choking the dragon and delivering St Margaret&#146;  (Lancashire, no. 969), but although the saint featured in pageants like that which welcomed Henry V in 1415, his cult seems to have put down few roots in the city, where there was only one church dedicated to him, in Botolph Lane. And although it expanded into the midlands and north, its incidence is only thinly recorded there. Such apparent indifference to St George in some regions may, however, have been partly counteracted by the influence of the nobility, and especially of those who were Garter knights. Thus &#145;Sainte-George-Tide&#146; was one of the &#145;Principal Feestes&#146; for the household of the fifth earl of Northumberland, who himself attended a requiem mass on the day after the feast &#145;for the saullis of all the Knightes of th'Order of the Garter Departede to the Mercy of God &hellip;&#146;  (Percy, 160, 324), and in the far north-west the Dacres, who had a chantry dedicated to the saint in Lanercost Priory, may likewise have done something to spread awareness of his cult; hence, perhaps, the carving of St George and the dragon in Carlisle Castle, executed about 1500.<br>
<br>Relics of St George are recorded as far afield as Haltemprice, a small Augustinian priory in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which claimed to have an arm (one of several). But most were found further south. The guild chapel in Norwich Cathedral also claimed to have an arm, and other relics were recorded at Lincoln, Yarmouth, London, and Salisbury, as well as Windsor, where there was a notable collection and where pilgrims could apparently obtain cheap badges representing the saint in combat with the dragon. The pattern of distribution is in keeping with evidence which suggests that on the whole the cult of St George intensified in the south and east of England in the later middle ages&#151;in the areas, that is, which contributed most to, and were most affected by, Anglo-French conflict&#151;rather than spreading into areas in which it was previously little known. It may be significant that it was in far-away Manchester that in 1421 Thomas, fifth Baron de la Warr, &#145;being partly a French man and partly an Englishman&#146;, was said to have converted St Mary's Church into a college dedicated &#145;to S. Dionyse, the patron of France, and S. George, the patron saint of England&#146;  (Arnold-Foster, 513). It is hard to imagine so eirenic a dedication closer to the battlelines.<br>
<br>Plays seem to have played an important part in spreading the cult of St George. In 1490 the chaplain of the guild of St George at New Romney went to Lydd in order to inform himself about the latter town's play of the saint (staged since at least 1456), so that it could be performed at home, while in 1511 no fewer than twenty-eight Cambridgeshire townships united to stage a play of St George at Bassingbourn. Plays and processions continued well into the 1530s, just as images of the saint went on being refurbished or replaced. In 1531 the churchwardens of Morebath in Devon recorded their contract with Thomas Glasse, how &#145;he schall make us a new iorge &amp; a new horse: to our dragon to hys one proper coste &amp; charge&#146;  (Wasson, 208&#150;9). By this time the saint's name had long been given to inns as well as ships, starting no later than 1402, when the Byzantine emperor's ambassadors were entertained at the sign of St George in Lombard Street, London. In 1524 the third earl of Kent died in this same inn. Forty years earlier a hostelry named &#145;le George&#146; had been recorded in St Albans. The foundation in 1537 of a guild of St George at Chester for the encouragement of shooting suggests that by then the saint's cult had become a secure, and increasingly familiar, element in England's social and religious life.<h2>
<a name="TheReformationandStGeorge"></a>The Reformation and St George</h2>By the 1530s, however, the cults of all non-scriptural saints were beginning to come under pressure from humanist disdain and Reformist criticism, either as pre-Christian survivals or as unwarranted additions to the sum of religious practice. Their existence was often challenged, their intercessory role rejected. Erasmus denounced soldiers who called on St George, comparing them with pagan devotees of Hercules, while Martin Luther later regarded the saint as an allegorical rather than a historical figure. It was hardly to be expected that St George would be proscribed while Henry VIII was king&#151;the posthumous inventory of his possessions records pictures, effigies, and embroideries of the saint, often richly wrought, for instance &#145;a Table of wall nuttree with the picture of Seyncte George on horsebacke raised with liquid golde and silver&#146;  (Starkey, 238). In 1536 St George's day was preserved as a high holy day. Nevertheless there were signs of diminishing reverence, ominous for the future. At Canterbury, for instance, the traditional St George's day procession was prohibited in 1538 for contravening that year's royal injunctions against &#145;feigned images &hellip; abused with pilgrimages or offering of anything made thereunto&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Historical Documents, 1485&#150;1558</span>, 812), and order was given for the destruction of the saint's image, albeit in the teeth of protests by the churchwarden. Elsewhere, however, the cult still attracted devotion, as at Norwich, where in 1543 the old celebrations persisted, with agreement &#145;that the Georg' shalhave xs. &amp; the berer of the dragon ijs. this yeer for ther' ffeez&#146;  (Grace, 149). Perhaps at this point it helped St George that he had increasingly come to be perceived as a destroyer of idols, as well as a dragon-slayer.<br>
<br>But with the death of Henry VIII in 1547, St George was left largely without earthly defenders in England. It was a sign of things soon to come that when the young Edward VI processed through London to his coronation he was met at the Little Conduit in Cheap by the saint on horseback, ready to deliver a speech promising to defend the new king as he had protected his ancestors, &#145;but for Lacke of Time it could not be done, his Grace made such Speed&#146;  (Leland, 4.319). Although it may have been Edward's advisers who on this occasion decided that St George's intercession was not worth having, the king himself soon came to share their views. On 23 April 1550, according to the evangelical Edward Underhill, he asked the Garter knights assembled at Greenwich, &#145;My Lords, I pray you what saint is S. George that we heere so honour him?&#146; Lord Treasurer Winchester responded with a paraphrase of the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>, telling how George &#145;out with his sword, and ran the dragon through with his speare&#146;, to which the king, barely able to speak for laughter, rejoined &#145;&#147;I pray you, my lord, and what did he with his sword the while?&#148; &#147;That I cannot tell your Majestie&#148;, said he. And so an end of that question of good S. George&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Narratives</span>, 323&#150;4).<br>
<br>By this time the traditional cults of saints like George were withering throughout England, as the evangelically inspired governments of the dukes of Somerset and Northumberland successively applied themselves to purging the realm of popish superstitions. In this they were increasingly influenced by the radical theology of Geneva, and to John Calvin St George was not even an allegory, but rather a spectre or even a &#145;bug&#146;. In August 1547 royal injunctions forbade all processions, and so ended the &#145;ridings&#146; in which the saint had so often appeared. The <span class="roman">Chantries Act</span> at the end of that year abolished the fraternities which had supported his cult. At Leicester the churchwardens of St Martin's sold for 12<i>d</i>. the horse on which George had ridden. At Ludlow the image of the saint fetched 18<i>d</i>., the dragon just 7<i>d</i>. At York the corporation was incredulous that the government should intend to abolish the guild dedicated to the national saint, and made ineffective representations to Westminster. At Norwich the fraternity of St George was saved from dissolution by a charter of Henry V making it a perpetual community, but its character changed markedly; it became instead the &#145;company and citizens of St George&#146;, a name chosen to distance it from the now proscribed doctrine of purgatory, while its annual festivities were severely curtailed. The reformers were determined that the saints should not receive the reverence due to God and Christ alone, and in 1548, in a treatise on the ten commandments published at Z&uuml;rich, the radical John Hooper rejoiced accordingly &#145;that Englishmen hath resigned St George's usurped title to the living God, the God of battle&#146;  (Hooper, 314).<br>
<br>The saints still had defenders, but the latter did not always do much to advance their cause. In May 1547 Stephen Gardiner, the conservative bishop of Winchester, defending images as an aid to the unlettered, observed how &#145;he that cannot read the scripture written about the King's great seal, yet he can read St George on horseback on the one side, and the King sitting in his majesty on the other side&#146;. Gleefully Somerset pointed out how &#145;As the image testifieth, the King's image is on both the sides &hellip; If it were St George, my lord, where is his spear and dragon?&#146; Gardiner's lame response, that &#145;I uttered the common language I was brought up in, after the old sort&#146;, though it bears witness to popular perceptions of St George, would only have confirmed the protector in his belief that the saint was a superstitious icon best dispensed with  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, 594&#150;5). St George's day still had red-letter status in the kalendar of the 1549 <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, but was demoted to black letters in that of 1552, when Bishop Nicholas Ridley also successfully prohibited its observance in London. Even at Windsor, where the Order of the Garter had long held a place at the very centre of the English cult of St George, the latter's position was steadily undermined. His images and relics in the Royal Collection were sold in instalments, like the &#145;Little plate of golde where in Sainct George's harte&#146;, sold in 1548/9, and the &#145;Ymage of Sainct George&#146; disposed of a year later  (Bond, 203, 205). And in 1550/51 the king himself drafted new statutes effectively ending the saint's association with the order. To prevent the honour due to God being given to &#145;a creature&#146;, the order's name was to be formally changed from that of St George to &#145;th'ordre of the gartier or defence of the trueth&#146;, while its emblem was no longer to be a representation of the saint, but &#145;a horsman graven, holding in one hand a sweard, pearsing a boke, on wich shall be written <i>Verbum Dei</i>&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>, 521&#150;3). Not all the proposed details survived reconsideration, but when revised statutes were finally promulgated on 17 March 1553, the Garter was no longer under the protection of St George.<br>
<br>Edward VI's new statutes for the Garter, like his reforms in religion generally, were quickly abrogated after the accession of Mary in 1553. The former St George's day ceremonies were revived at such places as Chester, York, and Norwich (though on a different day at the last), images restored in churches in several counties. On 23 April 1554 the queen herself processed with the knights of the Garter, in a ceremony which concluded with the election of her future husband, Philip of Spain, to their number. Twelve months later she &#145;lokyd out of a cassement&#146; while Philip and the other knights &#145;went in their robes, on procession, with three crosses&#146;, at Hampton Court  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 85). But in 1558 Mary's death once more called the status of St George into question. It was in keeping with Elizabeth I's cautious position on religion that he should have been a red-letter saint in the 1559 reissue of the prayer book, and that his feast should have been named as a holy day in a list promulgated in 1560. But a year later, as the cause of reform prevailed, he was again reduced to black lettering. In the calendar which John Foxe composed for the 1563 edition of his <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, however, St George retained a place, albeit now surrounded by Reformist luminaries like Wyclif, Erasmus, and Luther&#151;he and Mary Magdalene were the only non-apostolic saints from the Catholic calendar to do so. It is hard not to believe that it was his role as national saint that had preserved his standing.<h2>
<a name="Survivalsanddivergencies15581660"></a>Survivals and divergencies, 1558&#150;1660</h2>In the years after Elizabeth's accession, attitudes to St George developed along lines which lasted for centuries. Increasingly under pressure from the 1530s onwards, the late medieval cult effectively broke in two; the trappings of religion continued to support a court cult focused on the monarch and the Order of the Garter, while nationalist feeling and secular narratives inspired the development of an image of George as an essentially lay representative of England. But between the images of St George shaped respectively by royal policy and popular culture there lay a theological battleground, for the Catholic religion which before the Reformation had held these elements together now served instead to keep them apart, as the spokesmen for a new church establishment continued to attack the remains of its predecessor. In the eyes of militant protestants, intent on purging the realm of the relics of popery, George's traditional position as patron of England was irrelevant, while efforts to promote him as a way of enhancing the image of the monarch merely associated the crown with superstition and worse. The connection was to be ultimately disastrous for king and saint together. Attempts to bridge the religious gap, and to give St George a new standing as a specifically protestant saint, usually enjoyed only limited and temporary success.<br>
<br>For Queen Elizabeth, the Garter and St George, like much else, were primarily aids to her own glorification. Garter feasts were celebrated in lavish style, but ceased to be merely private ceremonies for courtiers and aristocrats; held at Greenwich or Whitehall instead of Windsor, the processions of the knights became magnificent public rituals which drew large crowds, and in the process exalted the image of the ruler who was sovereign of the order&#151;about 1575 Elizabeth had herself portrayed in that capacity. It remained customary, moreover, for knights of the order who were unable to attend the annual Garter feasts to celebrate St George's day, with all the splendour at their disposal, wherever they happened to be (the earl of Essex did so at Dublin in 1599), thereby further advertising the greatness of the monarch and her association with the saint. Such a development chimed well with the self-conscious revival of chivalry at court, proclaiming Elizabeth to be a ruler of time-honoured qualities, not least in being sustained by religion and by the valour and devotion of her subjects. One of her roles was that of leader of a protestant nation in war, and here she could associate her own image with that of St George the dragon-slayer (perhaps influenced by contemporary Dutch engravings of William the Silent in the same role), quelling an enemy easily identified with militant Catholicism. It was in this context that the writer George Whetstone, who served in the Netherlands against Spain in the mid-1580s, addressed <span class="italic">The Honorable Reputation of a Souldier</span> (1585) to &#145;the right valiant gentlemen &amp; souldiers, that are, or shalbe Armed under the Ensigne of Sainct George&#146;, and urged on his countrymen in verses which begin:<blockquote>
<div>God with S. George, Allon, brave Gentlemen,<br>
</div>
<div>Set Speares in rest, renew your auncient fame.<br>
</div> (sig. Aiiii)</blockquote>It was against this background that St George made his first and arguably only appearance in a major work of creative literature. Book 1 of Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span> (1590, revised edition 1596) is largely devoted to the adventures and misadventures of the Red Cross Knight, specifically identified by Contemplation, in the guise of an aged holy man, with St George:<blockquote>
<div>thou Saint George shalt called bee,<br>
</div>
<div>Saint George of mery England, the signe of victoree.<br>
</div> (canto 10.61)</blockquote>Although he drew on earlier sources, most obviously the <span class="italic">Golden Legend</span>, Spenser presents George as a native Englishman, stolen at birth by &#145;a Faerie&#146;. But there the similarities with contemporary romances end, as Spenser develops his learned and many-layered allegory. The Red Cross Knight is indeed St George, but he is many other things too, for the allegory is enriched as well as complicated by its kaleidoscopic quality, making it possible to see the knight, variously or simultaneously, as the type of the true-born Englishman, as Everyman, as Christian knighthood defending the church, as holiness, and even as Christ. Similarly the adventures in which he is assailed by the forces of sin and death represent at one and the same time the resistance of protestant righteousness to Catholic aggression and the tests faced by the Christian soul in pursuit of salvation, for either of which the knight's overthrow of the great dragon on the third day of their fight provides an appropriate conclusion.<br>
<br>References to Queen Elizabeth, who herself appears in several allegorical guises, and to the Order of the Garter, and sometimes to the two of them together, as when Una describes how, hearing of:<blockquote>
<div>That noble order hight of Maidenhed,<br>
</div>
<div>Forthwith to court of Gloriane I sped,<br>
</div>
<div>Of Gloriane great Queene of glory bright,<br>
</div> (canto 7.46)</blockquote>further associate Spenser's poem with the world of courtly chivalry, of which St George formed an emblematic part. After 1603 he continued in that role. Shortly before James VI became king of England, he compared the unruliness of his Scottish subjects with the security of English government: &#145;Saint george surelie rydes a towardlie rydding horse, quhaire I ame daylie burstin in daunting a wylde unreulie coalte&#146;  (Bruce, 31&#150;2). Once safely mounted alongside St George, James I presided over ever more lavish Garter celebrations, while the saint's association with them became still closer. The subtitle of Tristram White's <span class="italic">The Martyrdome of Saint George of Cappadocia</span> (1614) describes the latter as &#145;Titular patron of England and of the most Noble Order of the Garter&#146;. In public ceremonies away from court, too, George appeared as a friend of monarchy. With other knights and a dragon he took part in May pageants at Wells in 1607, and again six years later in entertainments provided for Queen Anne. At Chester, where there had been plays of St George in the early fifteenth century, he appeared with a lively dragon in a procession staged to greet Prince Henry, and was saluted by &#145;Rumor&#146;, in verses provided by Richard Davies, as the symbol of military valour:<blockquote>
<div>So Britaines, when they fight with cheere, they say,<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;God and Saint George for England!&#146; to this day.<br>
</div> (Nichols, <span class="italic">Progresses</span>, 2.30&#150;31)</blockquote>After 1625 St George became wellnigh overtly the patron of Charles I. In keeping with the latter's more ceremonious style of kingship, the Garter feasts became less public; moved back to Windsor, they were conducted in an ordered style akin to Laudian church ritual. In the same spirit St George was given a place in the calendar of <span class="italic">Collections of Private Devotions</span> (1627), a primer devised by John Cosin for the use of court ladies. The monarch's personal identification with the saint received spectacular visual expression in Sir Peter Paul Rubens's <span class="italic">Landscape with St George and the Dragon</span> of 1629/30 (Royal Collection), in which the victorious George, an idealized representation of King Charles, presents his sword to a no less romanticized Queen Henrietta Maria after overthrowing the dragon on the banks of the Thames. So close did the connection between saint and king become that impugning the one was commonly regarded as derogatory by the other. Thus in 1634, according to John Aubrey, the controversialist Daniel Featley was &#145;brought upon his knees&#146; before Archbishop Laud for having denied the existence of St George  (Aubrey, 68&#150;9), and a similar charge was brought against William Prynne.<br>
<br>The multiplication of such attacks called forth the first English defence of St George, in Peter Heylyn's <span class="italic">History of that Most Famous Saynt and Souldier of Christ St George of Cappadocia</span> (1631, enlarged edition 1633); significantly it had two dedications, one to King Charles and the other to the Order of the Garter. In a work of wide-ranging learning, drawing upon classical, patristic, and contemporary sources, Heylyn is principally concerned to establish the historicity of St George, against those who proclaim him a mythical or allegorical figure. This determination sometimes leads him into strange positions; thus he concedes that the story of George and the dragon, as narrated by Jacobus de Voragine, is so close to that of Perseus and Andromeda as told by Ovid, &#145;that were the names changed, and the occasion altered; we might with good reason affirme it for the same&#146;, yet declines to rule out the possibility of a dragon, because &#145;that in times before us, there have been Dragons, Serpentine creatures of excessive bulke, and no lesse danger, is a thing evident in the best writers&#146;  (Heylyn, 14&#150;16, 19). But though he concedes that the legend of the saint &#145;hath in it many vaine and grosse absurdities&#146; Heylyn argues steadfastly that this is no good reason for declaring that George is himself fictitious  (ibid., 56). Many leading English clergymen and theologians would have disagreed. John Boys, dean of Canterbury, and the famous Cambridge theologian William Perkins were among those whom Heylyn assailed, but the most formidable of his antagonists was certainly the radical puritan John Rainolds, whose <span class="italic">De Romanae ecclesiae idolatria</span> had appeared in 1596. For Rainolds, following Calvin, George is merely a figure of fantasy, at best an allegory. The arguments for his existence propounded by Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, which largely anticipated those of Heylyn, are dismissed as fallacious. In so far as there had ever been a historical George, he was no orthodox martyr but rather the Arian bishop of Alexandria lynched by his flock in 363. Several later writers followed Rainolds in rejecting the saint, though more often on theological than historical grounds. Thus for the poet George Wither in 1623, &#145;Jesus Christ is the true Saint George&#146;  (Wilson, 116&#150;17).<br>
<br>Puritan hostility to St George was apt to make itself felt outside the worlds of the court and of theological debate. That the May games staged round London in 1559 featured George and the dragon is a sign that the saint had retained a place in popular culture, albeit one largely shorn of formal religious affiliations. Even before the Reformation George seems to have been celebrated in towns and villages at least as much as a hero of romance, the dragon-killer who rescued a princess, as a Christian martyr. At Bassingbourn, where in 1511 he appeared in both capacities, the existence of playbooks (also attested at Lydd in 1532/3) helps to explain how the legend was transmitted. The <span class="italic">Satires</span> of Joseph Hall attest its survival in the late 1590s, with a list of &#145;forworne tales&#146; including:<blockquote>
<div>Saint Georges Sorrell, or his crosse of blood,<br>
</div>
<div>Arthurs round Board, or Caledonian wood,<br>

<div>Or holy battels of bold Charlemaine.<br>
</div> (Hall, 93&#150;4)</blockquote>Earlier in that decade Shakespeare had alluded to celebratory bonfires&#151;&#145;Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make, To keep our great Saint George's feast withal&#146;  (<span class="italic">1 Henry VI</span>, <span class="smallcap">I</span>.i, 153&#150;4)&#151;and also to inn-signs&#151;&#145;Saint George that swinged the dragon, and e'er since Sits on's horseback at mine hostess' door&#146;  (<span class="italic">King John</span>, <span class="smallcap">II</span>.i, 288&#150;9). Such signs had so proliferated that &#145;Saint George on horseback&#146; had become a synonym for immobility, and by inference, uselessness: &#145;An idle justice of the peace is like the picture of Saint George upon a signe-post with his sword drawne to no purpose&#146;  (Tilley, 581). But the saint's patriotic association, already given expression by Whetstone, survived such disrespectful treatment, to be memorably encapsulated in the war-cry &#145;God for Harry! England and Saint George!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry V</span>, <span class="smallcap">III</span>.i, 34).<br>
<br>Internal evidence dates <span class="italic">Henry V</span> to 1599. By then there had appeared the book that more than any other recast the legend of St George into the form in which it was thereafter transmitted in popular culture. Despite its title, <span class="italic">The Famous Historie of the Seaven Champions of Christendome</span> (1596&#150;7) by Richard Johnson is primarily concerned with the deeds of St George, later assisted by his sons. The evidence suggests that Johnson drew on earlier romances, both of the saint and of other legendary figures like Tristan, but took the shape of his narrative primarily from the early fourteenth-century tale of Bevis of Hampton, a lengthy saga of aristocratic adventure in foreign parts which was first printed in 1500. In Johnson's remarkably unsubtle narrative his George, like Spenser's, is an Englishman, born by caesarean section at Coventry to Albert, lord high steward of England, and his royal wife. Having escaped from the witch who stole him at birth, George sets out on a career of knight-errantry. He soon kills a dragon in Egypt and rescues the Princess Sabra, but declines to marry her before he has fulfilled his chivalric mission, a process entailing several years of mayhem and slaughter over much of central Europe and the Middle East. His victims include a number of giants and wild beasts, but are more often either black men or pagans, sometimes both. But although Johnson several times describes George as the champion of Christendom, the latter's religious zeal is less in evidence than his anxiety to protect virgins from rape, a threat sometimes described in near-pornographic detail. Eventually George returns to England, where he succumbs to the sting of a dragon he has killed on Dunsmore Heath outside Coventry, whereupon the king decrees his commemoration on 23 April, &#145;naming it S Georges day, upon which day he was most solemnely interred in the Citie where he was borne&#146;, and also &#145;that the Patron of the Land should be named S George, our Christian Champion&#146;  (Johnson, sig. Cc <i>verso</i>).<br>
<br>The saint who was acclaimed at Chester in 1610 as a native Englishman, and as renowned not for his martyrdom but for killing the dragon and quelling the heathen, could have derived from either Johnson or Spenser. Nor is it possible to say whether it was tradition or monarchism which after 1603 led to the gilded figure of the saint making intermittent appearances in civic pageants at Norwich, after he had been excluded from them since 1558, or to the mysterious custom reported from Morpeth in Northumberland for a young man chosen to represent the saint to come to church, suitably attended, on 23 April, and at the creed &#145;stand up and draw his sword&#146;  (Lancashire, no. 1190). But there can be no doubt that, away from the court, it was Johnson's lurid romance, as transmitted through plays and chapbooks, which did most to maintain the position of St George in popular culture. There may have been a play of &#145;St George for England&#146; by Wentworth Smith as early as 1603; there was certainly a dramatization of Johnson's book by John Kirke no later than 1638. Chapbooks containing massively abridged versions of the <span class="italic">Seaven Champions</span>, and sometimes a ballad of St George as well, circulated in huge numbers, and were surely the source of the story which John Bunyan later rebuked himself for having enjoyed in his misspent youth: &#145;give me a Ballad, a News-Book, George on horseback or Bevis of Southampton&#146;  (Spufford, 7). In this format Johnson's romance provided the basis for still further popularization of St George, for it has been convincingly argued that chapbooks were the principal source of the later mummers' plays.<br>
<br>Despite such varied support, St George's standing remained precarious. Among puritans and intellectuals his allegorical treatment by Spenser may well have helped to undermine respect for him as a historical figure, and his identification with crown and court was potentially equally damaging as the Stuart monarchy faced increasing hostility, in both England and Scotland. An engraving of Queen Elizabeth from the 1620s or 1630s, representing her with the accoutrements of St George against the background of the Spanish Armada, shows how the images of the queen and saint together could be manipulated to attack the Stuarts for their unwillingness to assist the protestant cause in Europe. But while the memory of Elizabeth was increasingly cherished, St George was more likely to be attacked. In 1609 he appeared side by side with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60305/', "St Andrew")</script> in London in the lord mayor's pageant, but around 1634 a tract entitled <span class="italic">A Comparison between St Andrew and St George</span> praised the apostolic patron of Scotland at the expense of his mythical English equivalent. Nor were the crown's critics likely to be any more sympathetic towards George as a figure in popular culture. Without a basis in scripture, he was readily associated with popish or heathen superstitions. Thus in his <span class="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</span> Robert Burton placed &#145;St George for England&#146; in &#145;a rable of Romish Deities&#146;  (Burton, 3.384). Unsurprisingly, such associations led to his cult being attacked, and where possible suppressed, by parliament and its supporters during and after the civil wars. His images were not spared by puritan iconoclasts. William Dowsing destroyed several of them, recording, for instance, how on 26 January 1643 &#145;We pulled down St George and the Dragon&#146; at St Catharine's College, Cambridge  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Cooper, 166). Then in 1645 the celebration of his feast day was formally prohibited through the <span class="italic">Directory for the Publique Worship of God</span> which brought an end to the annual celebrations at places like Norwich: there, and no doubt elsewhere, there was to be &#145;no standard with the George thereon&#146;  (Hutton, <span class="italic">Merry England</span>, 208). But though the saint was proscribed his flag survived, if without his name&#151;in 1649 the council of state ordered that &#145;Ships at Sea in service of the State shall onely beare the red Crosse in a white flag&#146;  (Perrin, 62&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Monarchsmummersandmockers16601837"></a>Monarchs, mummers, and mockers, 1660&#150;1837</h2>The association of St George with the English monarchy survived the civil wars, and to outward appearances was strengthened by the return of the Stuarts. General George Monck was likened to the saint at the time of the Restoration which he did so much to bring about, and Charles II, James II, and Anne all chose to have themselves crowned on 23 April, making it entirely appropriate for Thomas Lowick to dedicate to Charles his <span class="italic">History of the Life &amp; Martyrdom of St George, the Titular Patron of England</span> (1664). But the break with the past had arguably been too great for monarchy and saint to continue to buttress one another as in the past. Only a modest number of parishes marked 23 April with bonfires&#151;an estimated 13 per cent under Charles, rising to 20 per cent under his brother. The saint's day was celebrated at Chester in 1660, but such festivities continued only until 1678. At Norwich the annual civic processions no longer found room for St George, although the dragon, &#145;a magnificent reptile, all glittering in green and gold&#146;, took part every year until 1835  (R. Chambers, 1.541). Samuel Pepys attended Charles's coronation in 1661, but without noting in his diary that it took place on St George's day, and in subsequent years he usually recorded either saint's day or coronation day only if it coincided with a Garter feast. Among churchmen and scholars doubts about the saint's existence persisted. In 1676 Edward Stillingfleet observed of those who reverenced saints like Christopher and George, that &#145;the wisest among them cannot to this day tell, whether they were <i>Saints</i> or <i>Allegories</i>&#146;  (Wilson, 149). Sir Thomas Browne was no more certain: &#145;That such a person there was, we shall not contend&#146;  (Browne, 1.411). John Aubrey shared their doubts, leavened with a characteristically wry humour: &#145;I will conclude this paragraph with these following verses, that I remember somewhere&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>To save a Mayd, St George the Dragon slew,<br>
</div>
<div>A pretty tale, if all is told be true:<br>
</div>
<div>Most say, there are no Dragons: and `tis sayd,<br>
</div>
<div>There was no George; pray God there was a Mayd.<br>
</div> (Aubrey, 68&#150;9)</blockquote>A new element of flippancy was beginning to colour attitudes to St George, perceptible in the facetiously long-winded poem, <span class="italic">St George for England: the Second Part</span>, which John Grubb, of Christ Church, Oxford, wrote in 1688 as a continuation of an earlier ballad, to gain admission to a university club which met on St George's day and all of whose members were to be named George.<br>
<br>In the year that Grubb wrote his poem Anthony Wood recorded that bonfires were lit and bells rung all over Oxford on St George's day. Perhaps this was to be expected in a city traditionally loyal to the Stuarts. But the decades immediately after the deposition of James II saw regard for St George at a low ebb. Attacks on his historicity continued. In 1704 the Revd Thomas Salmon, the musicological rector of Meppershall, published <span class="italic">A New Historical Account of St George for England, and the Original of the Most Noble Order of the Garter</span>, in which he argued, without the least plausibility, that the original patron of the nation was the eighth-century papal legate George of Ostia, later supplanted by the eastern intruder through the machinations of monks. There are hints that St George, whoever he was conceived to be, retained a traditional respect among soldiers and sailors. In 1704 the chaplain of the <i>Ranelagh</i> recorded that on 23 April the ship was &#145;dress'd very fine with all the colours and penants&#146;  (Taylor, 137&#150;8), while on the same day two years later, according to the New England puritan Samuel Sewall, the governor came to Boston with an escort of troops, and conducted obstreperous celebrations&#151;&#145;Because to drinking Healths, now the Keeping of a Day to fictitious St. George, is plainly set on foot&#146;  (Holford-Strevens and Blackburn, 169). Later in the eighteenth century a number of leading towns on the American coastline established societies of St George to provide assistance to English immigrants. For many of the English who stayed at home, however, the saint seems to have become primarily associated with drinking and sex. About 1700 there were sixty-three inn-signs in London representing the saint, and &#145;riding St George&#146;, or &#145;the dragon upon St George&#146;, had become the name popularly given to the sexual act when the woman took the upper position.<br>
<br>As far as attitudes to St George were concerned, the establishment of a new dynasty in 1714 was important at first principally for the names borne by its first four monarchs, making it possible for the loyal, the ambitious, and the sycophantic to acclaim the one by celebrating the other, as was particularly apparent in the years immediately after the accession of George I. Thomas Dawson, who had published his erudite <span class="italic">Memoirs of St George the English Patron</span> by the end of 1714, with a dedication to the new king, was unusually quick off the mark. A number of church dedications reflect the same development, for instance that of St George's Church built in London's aptly named Hanover Square between 1721 and 1724. The fact that the Society of Antiquaries of London, founded in 1717, was dedicated to St George may likewise have owed something to a wish to cultivate the Hanoverian monarchy, though it may also been due to the fervent admiration felt for the saint by the eccentric but influential Browne Willis, one of the society's founder members.<br>
<br>For much of the eighteenth century attitudes to St George seem to have varied among the classes of society. Although Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the youthful fifth duke of Bedford and other children enacting St George and the dragon (exhibited 1777, since destroyed), there is little evidence of aristocratic interest in the saint, for whom it seems likely that the nobility felt much the same condescension that they usually extended to the monarchy. The intelligentsia, outside the established church, tended to remain sceptical, and was prepared to make fun of St George, directly or by implication. The principal target of Henry Cary's burlesque opera <span class="italic">The Dragon of Wantley</span> (1737) was the conventions of Italian opera, but the fate of the eponymous dragon, dispatched by Moore of Moore Hall by a kick up the backside, was hardly reverential towards the national saint either. In the mid-1750s John Byrom wrote a facetious poem (published in 1779) suggesting that St George had been confused with Pope Gregory the Great, and when the elder Samuel Pegge responded with a defence of George's historicity in the pages of <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> he was ridiculed by Horace Walpole, who described Pegge's article as &#145;despicable. All his arguments are equally good for proving the existence of the dragon&#146;  (Lewis and Wallace, 2.163&#150;4). A far more telling attack on the saint&#151;deadlier, indeed, for the Olympian disdain with which it was delivered&#151;was that of Edward Gibbon, who having described the misdeeds and violent death of Archbishop George of Alexandria, concluded:<blockquote>The odious stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place, assumed the mask of a martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero; and the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed into the renowned St. George of England, the patron of arms, of chivalry, and of the Garter. (Gibbon, 1.903)</blockquote>In a footnote Gibbon acknowledged that &#145;This transformation is not given as absolutely certain, but as extremely probable.&#146; He was being disingenuous. His sole source was an unsupported assertion among a French scholar's posthumous <i>pens&eacute;es</i>, and he certainly knew of Heylyn's riposte to Rainolds, whose arguments for a confusion of Georges had largely anticipated Gibbon's own, for he cited it in the very next footnote, but in such a context mockery was more effective than scholarship. John Milner's rejoinder of 1792, though learned, was laborious by comparison.<br>
<br>The figure of St George received more respect at humbler levels of society. The story of the dragon fight was savoured. In 1757 Bishop Richard Pococke, travelling in Wiltshire, was told by &#145;peasants&#146; that &#145;Dragon's Hill&#146; near Highworth was the site of George's victory, and that grass would not grow where the dragon's blood had been spilt. But among working people George became prominent above all in mummers' plays. The early history of these entertainments is obscure. The fact that George takes a leading part in most of them supports the argument that they derived principally from chapbooks and ballads for which Johnson's <span class="italic">Seaven Champions</span> was a major source, and which continued to circulate in large numbers well into the nineteenth century. But evidence for their early development is meagre. A Dublin manuscript of <i>c</i>.1800 contains an account from about 1685 of:<blockquote>the drollest piece of mummery I ever saw in or out of Ireland. There was St George and St Dennis and St Patrick in their buffe coats and the Turk likewise and Oliver Cromwell, and a Doctor and an old woman who made rare sport till Beelzebub came in with a frying pan upon his shoulder and a great flail in his hand. (Helm, 7)</blockquote>It is not said when in the year the Dublin play was staged, but at Exeter by 1737 it was customarily associated with Christmas, as it has usually been ever since:<blockquote>
<div>With less Decorum Christmas Mummer struts,<br>
</div>
<div>Than on He bears his goodly Grace of Guts,<br>
</div>
<div>Though that same Mummer England's Heroe plays<br>
</div>
<div>And Dragon with his Whineard's Flourish slays.<br>
</div> (Bede, 464)</blockquote>A similar play was recorded in Cheshire in 1788, while in 1811 &#145;a kind of short piece about St George and the Dragon and the Holy Land which ended in a sham fight&#146; was reported at Halifax in Nova Scotia  (Helm, 8). Direct references to the dragon are in fact rare in mummers' plays outside the challenge with which George usually opens the play, but it is likely that his principal antagonist, commonly named &#145;Slasher&#146;, is in fact a transmogrification of George's monstrous foe, hence his boast:<blockquote>
<div>My head is made of iron<br>
</div>
<div>My body is made of steel<br>
</div>
<div>My arms and legs of beaten brass;<br>
</div>
<div>No man can make me feel.<br>
</div> (E. K. Chambers, <span class="italic">English Folk-Play</span>, 177&#150;8)</blockquote>The princess very seldom has any part in the plays, although she, too, is mentioned in George's challenge. Her absence was probably due to the mummers' plays having acquired a shadowy but potent undercurrent of symbolism, one to which they owed a good deal of their staying power but from which the feminine element was largely excluded. An essential component of the substructure of the plays upon which the cast of stock characters traditionally improvises its comic business is the theme of death and resurrection, either of the adversary whom George kills or of George himself. In this respect George is a fertility figure, a role once attributed to him, as &#145;Green George&#146;, across much of eastern Europe, where he was &#145;a spirit of trees or vegetation in general&#146;  (Frazer, 2.343). In England he takes on a similar function in a song from the Padstow hobby-horse procession:<blockquote>
<div>Where is St George, where is he, O,<br>
</div>
<div>He is out in his longboat all on the salt sea, O,<br>
</div>
<div>And in every land, O, the land that ere we go,<br>
</div>
<div>And for to fetch the summer home,<br>
</div>
<div>The summer and the May, O,<br>
</div>
<div>For summer is acome and winter is ago.<br>
</div> (Hulst, 113)</blockquote>It is easy to see how George's association with the generation of crops and livestock, arising from his springtime feast day, could be transferred with equal appropriateness to the season of the turning of the year. The figure of St George as he appeared in mummers' plays was also enriched by a patriotic component which may have developed, at least in part, through an association with the monarchy resulting from a coincidence of names. In the plays George very often proclaims himself to be &#145;King George&#146; or &#145;Prince George&#146;, or more precisely to be George III or even George IV, though in all cases he then goes on to describe how he slew the dragon and won the king of Egypt's daughter. The connection gave added force to an image of the saint as the champion of England, and as such the embodiment of national superiority, as he claims to be in the sword dance from the Shetland Islands, recorded by Sir Walter Scott and dated by him to about 1788:<blockquote>
<div>In England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, and Spain,<br>
</div>
<div>Have I been tried with that good sword of steel.<br>
</div>
<div>Yet I deny that ever a man did make me yield;<br>
</div>
<div>For in my body there is strength,<br>
</div>
<div>As by my manhood may be seen;<br>
</div>
<div>And I, with that good sword of length,<br>
</div>
<div>Have oftentimes in peril been,<br>
</div>
<div>And over champions was I king.<br>
</div> (Scott, <span class="italic">The Pirate</span>, 501&#150;2)</blockquote>The late 1780s saw attempts at other levels of society to exploit, or develop, an image of St George as a patriotic icon. Probably these should be seen in the context first of attempts to rebuild national self-confidence after the loss of the American colonies in 1783 and then of war with France from 1792. Between 1787 and 1789 Benjamin West's paintings for the king's audience chamber at Windsor Castle included one of St George and the dragon for the overmantel, and paintings by Matthew Wyatt for the royal apartments, executed about 1805, included episodes from the life of the saint. In 1789 a play called <span class="italic">St George's Day, or, Britons Rejoice</span> was staged at Covent Garden. Later on, the wellnigh demonic qualities attributed to Napoleon in England made it appropriate for a cartoon of 1805, entitled <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span>, to show George III as the saint, in the act of dealing its death blow to a dragon with the French emperor's head, and for Walter Scott, in <span class="italic">The Field of Waterloo</span> (1815), to exclaim:<blockquote>
<div>Now, Island Empress, wave thy crest on high,<br>
</div>
<div>And bid the banner of thy patron flow,<br>
</div>
<div>Gallant St George, the flower of Chivalry,<br>
</div>
<div>For thou hast faced, like him, a dragon foe,<br>
</div>
<div>And rescued innocence from overthrow,<br>
</div>
<div>And trampled down, like him, tyrannic might.<br>
</div> (Girouard, 33)</blockquote>For Scott himself the image would have been given additional force by his fascination with medieval art and culture, which he did much to promote. In his novel <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1820), set in late twelfth-century England, nearly everyone, from Richard I downwards, swears by St George, sometimes with Merry England thrown in; at the novel's climactic moment, when Ivanhoe challenges the villainous Brian de Bois-Guilbert, he invokes the aid &#145;of God, of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good knight&#146;  (chap. 43). In 1822 <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon, or, The Seven Champions of Christendom</span>, was performed at the Royal Amphitheatre in London. The cult of chivalry had not yet reached its apogee, however, and the influence of the ancient world remained potent in public culture. In 1816 St George appeared on the English currency for the first time since the reign of Henry VIII, in a handsome engraving for the gold sovereign by Benedetto Pistrucci in which the dragon-slaying saint closely resembles Greek carvings of Perseus. But however it was expressed, a connection with St George was clearly becoming one worth cultivating, as George IV showed when he ordered that his own birthday should be celebrated on 23 April instead of 12 August; whether out of respect for the saint or disrespect for the monarch, however, the royal command was ignored.<h2>
<a name="Victorianvisions18371914"></a>Victorian visions, 1837&#150;1914</h2>At the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 St George probably enjoyed a wider appeal in England than at any time since the mid-seventeenth century. He had still to recover from the loss of much of his standing as a specifically religious figure at the Reformation, and arguably never fully did so, but during the nineteenth century he gained strength instead from a growing association with the combined forces of English nationalism and imperial expansion. Like the empire itself, this development was slow. In 1853 George was eulogized in an almost impenetrable rhapsody by the eccentric occultist Hargrave Jennings, telling how:<blockquote>his goodly cross of red, which shone a very beacon in the conflicts with the Paynim, hath, of itself, passed, and been eagerly transmitted from land to land, and hath served as the rallying light for a hundred, (but for it), to all Christian and humane tendencies, benighted generations. (Jennings, 3&#150;4)</blockquote>Churches and missions were an essential part of that process of enlightenment, and cathedrals were at various times dedicated to St George at Madras in India (where Fort St George had been the nucleus of the English settlement since the mid-seventeenth century), at Cape Town and Grahamstown in South Africa, at Kingston in the Windward Islands, and at Georgetown in British Guiana. The Anglican cathedral in Jerusalem, too, was dedicated to him, as were the churches of the English chaplaincies in Leghorn, Lisbon, Paris, Berlin, and the Azores, and one of the English churches in Cannes. In 1897 his flag's association with empire, and the latter's perceived benevolence, were acclaimed together in Edward Elgar's &#145;ballad&#146; <span class="italic">The Banner of St George</span>, with words by Shapcott Wensley, in which George, having vanquished the dragon, bids farewell to Princess Sabra and tells how:<blockquote>
<div>Where the strong the weak oppress,<br>
</div>
<div>Where the suffering succour crave,<br>
</div>
<div>Where the tyrant spreads distress,<br>
</div>
<div>There the cross of George must wave!<br>
</div> (p. iv)</blockquote>The last verse of the epilogue (marked <i>largamente e grandioso</i> by Elgar) saluted Queen Victoria. She too celebrated St George, if less bombastically. As a girl she recorded enjoying the spectacular show of <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon</span> put on at Drury Lane in the 1830s by Andrew Ducrow, while in 1908 it was reported how:<blockquote>Until a few years ago an old ballad called &#145;St George for England&#146; was sung at Windsor on 23 April by the choirboys of St George's Chapel, and from the time of George I until the reign of the late Queen Victoria, a golden rose decorated the royal dining-table on the same day. (Bulley, 30&#150;31)</blockquote>In 1896 she became the patron of the Society of St George, founded for patriotic purposes two years earlier (the society acquired its royal prefix under Edward VII). The Church of England once more felt able to reverence St George, on the evidence of a &#145;supplementary collect&#146; published by the bishop of Salisbury in 1899, invoking him, however, as a martyr and soldier rather than as a dragon-killer&#151;&#145;O Lord God of hosts, Who didst give grace to Thy servant George to lay aside the fear of man and to confess thee even unto death&#146;  (Wordsworth, 323). Six years earlier, when the Roman Catholic church had proposed that the Virgin and St Peter should become the patrons of England, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan wrote reassuringly to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, upholding George's traditional role of &#145;military protector&#146; of England, and declaring that &#145;Catholics, at all events, are not likely to forget the historic and national cry and prayer, &#147;St George for England&#148;&#146;  (Arnold-Foster, 465).<br>
<br>The towns and villages of England continued to encounter St George principally through chapbooks, ballads, and mummers' plays, all of which proliferated, or at least are recorded as proliferating, during the nineteenth century. References to mummers' plays become suddenly plentiful, and show that they were performed in industrial towns and cities as well as in the countryside, perhaps more often in the midlands and north than in the southern counties. In Northern Ireland, mummers staged a play in Belfast in the 1890s apparently remarkably similar to that put on in late seventeenth-century Dublin&#151;St George appeared with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21562/', "St Patrick")</script> and Oliver Cromwell as well as with such stock characters as the Turky Champion, Beelzebub, Little Devil Doubt, and a Doctor. The words attributed to St George in such productions show that here, too, he often struck a robustly patriotic note, sometimes British, in the company of Sts Patrick, David, and Andrew, and sometimes for England alone. In a play recorded at Lutterworth at Christmas 1863, for instance, he announces himself as the king of England's only son:<blockquote>
<div>I am Prince George, a worthy knight;<br>
</div>
<div>I'll spend my blood for England's right.<br>
</div>
<div>England's right I will maintain;<br>
</div>
<div>I'll fight for old England once again.<br>
</div> (E. K. Chambers, <span class="italic">Medieval Stage</span>, 2.276&#150;9)</blockquote>The fact that he continued to be often referred to as Prince or King George can only have accentuated his Englishness.<br>
<br>St George achieved this apotheosis despite opposition. As before, there were those who doubted his existence. The study of comparative religion, which was beginning to have momentous effects for attitudes to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, also had corrosive implications for the national saint; thus for Anna Jameson he was no more than a &#145;mythic allegory by which was figured the conquest achieved by beneficent power over the tyranny of wickedness &hellip; this time-consecrated myth transplanted into Christendom&#146;  (Jameson, 2.398), while for Sabine Baring-Gould he was &#145;a Semitic god Christianized&#146;  (Baring-Gould, 291). In 1853 George was attacked by Ralph Waldo Emerson in terms borrowed directly from Gibbon. Some twenty years later John Ruskin replied to Emerson in a defence of George's historicity explicitly derived from Heylyn. But in the 1870s Ruskin was interested in George less as a historical figure than as a moral symbol, at a time when he was increasingly concerned with social reform, and it was for that reason that he invited his followers to join him in what at first he called &#145;my St George's Company&#146;, eventually the guild of St George, which met for the first time in 1879. Ruskin was willing to accept the mythico-allegorical derivation of George's combat with the dragon because he saw the mission of his own guild in allegorical terms, a war waged on behalf of traditional Christian values, represented by the saint, against the disruptive forces of industrial capitalism, embodied in &#145;the Lord of Decomposition, the old Dragon himself&#146;  (Ruskin, 1.332).<br>
<br>As an institution the guild of St George failed. But the ideas behind it proved influential. Among Ruskin's disciples was Edward Carpenter, an early socialist who in 1908 published <span class="italic">St George and the Dragon: a Play in Three Acts for Children and Young Folk</span>, dedicated to the Independent Labour Party and Socialist Sunday Schools. Its message is all that Ruskin might have wished, for after an opening lament for a time &#145;when all was gladness in this land and men and women sang at their work, and rejoiced in their strength and in the goodly stores they won by their labour from the soil&#146;, St George kills a dragon explicitly identified as Greed, who &#145;slays the souls Of men, as well as takes their bodies' toll&#146;, after which he and the princess he has saved are chosen by the people to be their rulers, in the place of &#145;such as consult their own ease and safety first and leave their people to perish&#146;  (pp. 4, 12&#150;13, 15). Ruskin might have regretted that a play about St George made no mention whatever of Christianity, or any other religion, but he could not have charged Carpenter with lack of seriousness. There must have been many of his contemporaries, however, for whom the saint remained little more than an inn-sign, like the George and the Dragon noticed in London, with the inscription below, &#145;Entertainment for man and horse&#146;  (Brand, 2.357&#150;8), or the cheerful sign painted in 1876 by the artist John Evan Hodgson and a friend for the George and the Dragon at Wargrave, Berkshire, showing the fight on one side, and the victorious saint reviving himself with beer on the other.<br>
<br>A similarly light-hearted note is struck by Kenneth Grahame's <span class="italic">The Reluctant Dragon</span>, first published in <span class="italic">Dream Days</span> (1899). In this engaging fable a dragon appears on the downs, where he befriends a small boy, shows an unexpected talent for poetry, and settles down to a quiet life&#151;&#145;Meanwhile the dragon, a happy Bohemian, lolled on the turf, enjoyed the sunsets, told antediluvian anecdotes to the Boy, and polished his old verses while meditating on fresh ones&#146;  (Grahame, 135). His idyllic existence is disturbed by the arrival of St George, whom he is eventually compelled to fight by the machinations of the locals, who are betting on the outcome. By now George is no more eager for the fray than the dragon, but the unenthusiastic combatants finally agree that George shall enjoy a bloodless triumph in the third round. The day concludes with a banquet, at which the dragon, having &#145;won popularity and a sure footing in society &hellip; proved the life and soul of the evening&#146;  (ibid., 149).<br>
<br>Others continued to take St George with the utmost seriousness. One such was Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, for whom the saint was the embodiment of chivalry, and as such &#145;the patron saint of cavalry and scouts all over Europe&#146;, on whose day &#145;all good scouts wear a rose in his honour and fly their flags&#146;  (Baden-Powell, 210). He was treated no less reverently in the children's play <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span> by Mrs Clifford Mills and Reginald Owen (the latter under the pseudonym John Ramsey), first performed on 21 December 1911 and published as a novel by Mrs Mills in the following year. Here two children, Crispin and Rosamund, desperate to be reunited with their absent parents and possessing a magic carpet which can take them to &#145;the land where all lost loved ones are found&#146;, successfully call on St George to accompany and assist them. They are opposed by their Uncle Joseph, a Hampstead liberal before his time who mocks the union jack and is eventually eaten by hyenas, and by his abettor the Dragon King. The latter reflects on the children's ally:<blockquote>This saint, the champion of England, who spoke to the hearts not the greed of his countrymen, who demanded from those who fought his country's battle the sacrifice of self purpose and the clean hand to wield the sword, to what heights had he not led Englishmen in the past, to what greater heights would not his lofty spirit lead them in the future? (Mills, 70)</blockquote>The story culminates in George's last-minute appearance to save the children from death, and his challenge to the Dragon King: &#145;Once more we meet, arch-enemy&#146;, he cried, &#145;to fight the everlasting fight of good and evil&#146;  (ibid., 154). Good prevails in the apocalyptic struggle, and all ends happily.<br>
<br>The association of St George with the forces of righteousness, and of both with England, is explicit throughout <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span>, but equally apparent is an undertone of menace, even pessimism. In an analogy Ruskin would have appreciated, the saint represents not only England but also the heroic qualities needed to defeat the forces of materialism and greed which threaten the nation's soul, forces symbolized by the dragon. The outcome of their conflict cannot be taken for granted. When he first appears, wrapped in a cloak, the children do not recognize St George, mistaking him for one of the unemployed, to which he responds with the admission that &#145;I am &hellip; one of England's unemployed ideals &hellip; I am no longer wanted here, men do not war with the dragon nowadays, and the maidens prefer to fight their own battles&#146;. But when Rosamund calls on him for aid, the saint is utterly transformed, into &#145;the St George they knew and honoured&#151;a noble knight in shining armour. Tall, slender and muscular, yellow-haired, English of the English&#146;  (Mills, 41&#150;3). The change was doubtless such as was looked for by those concerned for the moral health of England. George's physical appearance, English or otherwise, was in fact seldom illustrated in the high art of the Victorian age, though his legend inspired paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, and the image evoked by Mrs Mills probably derived from children's books and from the illustrations of the numerous studies of the saint published in the years on either side of 1900. Those studies in turn reflect the public position George had increasingly come to occupy as a patriotic as well as a moral symbol. In 1899 it was estimated that there were over 190 churches dedicated to him in England, with at least one in every county except Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Rutland. By this time his feast day was being widely celebrated. In 1902, for instance, children near Dunstable were given a holiday from school, while in 1914 the townspeople of Kidderminster flew flags and held a church service. Ignorance, indifference, and mockery no doubt continued, but to outward appearances St George was not only English himself, he had become part of the English cultural landscape.<h2>
<a name="Imagesofwarandpeace19142000"></a>Images of war and peace, 1914&#150;2000</h2>The beginning of the First World War in 1914 quickly led to a revelation of St George's significance as a patriotic icon, albeit in an oblique fashion. Among the literary responses to the outbreak of war was Arthur Machen's story &#145;The bowmen&#146;, published in London's <span class="italic">Evening News</span> on 29 September 1914, telling how during the retreat from Mons an English soldier repeats the inscription calling on St George which he remembers having seen on a plate in a vegetarian restaurant. A line of figures promptly materializes, the pursuing Germans fall under a hail of arrows, and although the saint himself does not appear, &#145;the man who knew what nuts tasted like when they called themselves steak knew also that St George had brought his Agincourt Bowmen to help the English&#146;  (Machen, 66). Machen's patriotic fantasy made a startling impact, and within months the overwrought public imagination had transformed his dimly perceived archers, originally &#145;a long line of shapes, with a shining about them&#146;, so that &#145;the Bowmen of my story have become &#147;the Angels of Mons&#148;. In this shape they have been received with respect and credence everywhere, or almost everywhere&#146;  (ibid., 18&#150;19). St George is similarly but more explicitly represented in John Hassall's painting of 1915, <span class="italic">Vision of St George over the Battlefield</span> (IWM), where his appearance over the trenches, mounted and armed as a medieval crusader, brings terror to the Germans. At Thaxted in Essex, the vicar, Conrad Noel, turned an aisle of the parish church into a wartime shrine, with a picture of St George defeating the dragon surrounded by the flags of Britain's allies, while Jessie Pope explicitly equated the soldiers in the trenches with the English national saint:<blockquote>
<div>Of gallant St Georges to-day we've a legion,<br>
</div>
<div>As sturdy and game as the knights of Romance;<br>
</div>
<div>They are fighting their fight in that shell-battered region<br>
</div>
<div>That bears the vague pseudonym&#151;&#145;Somewhere in France&#146; &hellip;<br>
</div> (Parker, 226)</blockquote>Whether the troops themselves valued the association is open to question, although it was with the signal &#145;St George for England&#146; that Admiral Roger Keyes led a daring raid against Zeebrugge on 23 April 1918.<br>
<br>As the war ended G. F. Raggett concluded a short book which he entitled <span class="italic">An Essay on the Life of St George the Martyr, Patron Saint of England</span> (1919). Though eventually dedicated to Keyes, it had been begun before the Zeebrugge raid, &#145;to be a guide, although very imperfect, to the vast number of English people who know nothing whatever about our Saint&#146;  (p. 3). By the time Raggett's book appeared his fellow countrymen (whose ignorance he probably exaggerated) were being widely familiarized with the form of St George through the medium of public war memorials. The saint is nearly always represented as a medieval knight victorious over the dragon, most strikingly in Adrian Jones's powerful cavalry memorial, now in London's Hyde Park; Eric Gill's memorial at Trumpington, near Cambridge, is exceptional in showing George as a soldier of the trenches. Sometimes he was set upon memorials in places where he already had a particular local appeal, as at Newcastle upon Tyne, where he had long featured on the regimental cap-badge of the Northumberland Fusiliers, but the wide distribution of such figures seems more often to have stemmed simply from his constituting an appropriately warlike and patriotic image, albeit one capable of conveying more than one message. In some cases the saint appears as a transcendental image of good overcoming evil, as at Lawrence Sheriff School, Rugby, where the memorial represents George killing his traditional adversary above the inscription: &#145;There are dragons still. 1914&#150;1918&#146;. And he was also envisaged as embodying the values for which the war had been fought and the qualities by which it had been won. The duke of York (later King George VI), when unveiling the memorial at the Leys School, Cambridge, said of its central image of St George: &#145;It will stand for all time, a pivot of the school's history and tradition and the inspiration of those ideals of chivalry, self-sacrifice, and patriotism which are essential to the highest conduct and character&#146;  (Borg, 100&#150;01). There could be no sectarian monopoly of such ideals, and in London memorial chapels commemorating the victims of the 1914&#150;18 war were dedicated to St George in both the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral and the Anglican Westminster Abbey, while a stained-glass window served the same purpose in Wesley's Chapel.<br>
<br>No doubt it was at least partly due to his commemorative association with the war dead that between 1918 and 1939 St George's day continued to be fairly widely observed. He was promoted by the Royal Society of St George, which had 20,000 members by 1920, and by the Boy Scouts, and 23 April was often marked by church services and the flying of flags, and sometimes by a show or f&ecirc;te, which might include a pageant of the saint and the dragon. It was on St George's day that George V opened the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924. Although in this context George remained an essentially backward-looking patriotic symbol, he was also capable of being used for progressive purposes. In <span class="italic">Vision of England, '38</span>, the young radical poet George Barker tells of encountering the saint in a vision set at Brighton, where he emerges from the sea to denounce capitalism in terms Ruskin would have approved&#151;&#145;I killed an enormous monster, but the brute Still rules England with its scales of gold&#146;&#151;and then imagines him rising in the north to free &#145;The national man and woman, who groan!&#146;  (Barker, 68, 75). But when war with Germany broke out again in 1939, George once more became an emblem of valour and resistance, though not always to the same end. Soldiers fighting in the western desert constructed a chapel dedicated to him, making bells from shell cases and altar furnishings from gun parts. And acts of civilian bravery on the home front were marked by the award of the George Medal, under a royal warrant of 24 September 1940 which stipulated that the reverse should show &#145;St George slaying the dragon on the coast of England&#146;  (Henderson, 106). But shortly afterwards the saint's name and military role were invoked for very different purposes by the traitor John Amery, a fanatical anti-communist who defected to the Nazis and tried to persuade British prisoners of war to enlist in what he called the Legion of St George, to fight alongside the Germans against the Russians. The name of the English national saint had no appeal, for only about thirty men enlisted, and when Amery left Berlin at the end of 1943 the tiny force was handed over to the SS, who renamed it the British Free Corps.<br>
<br>Although Amery's venture can hardly be held responsible, there are signs that even before war ended the appeal of St George as a heroic warrior-saint was beginning to wane in England. The chivalric qualities he could still be seen as embodying in the early decades of the twentieth century had little meaning to people enduring rationing and the blitz, and he was easily identified with retrograde inter-war social attitudes by those who now looked forward to the welfare state, and for whom empire and military glory had lost their appeal. In 1943 23 April fell on Good Friday, and St George's day was therefore celebrated on 3 May instead. The move had the support of the archbishop of Canterbury but was not a success. A year later a BBC producer declared that &#145;nine out of ten people haven't the least idea who St George was and don't care anyway&#146;  (Weight, 56). He may have been over-freely attributing his own views to the nation at large, but there is no doubt that the years following 1945 saw a steady decline in interest in the saint. He again featured in a number of war memorials&#151;the chapel of remembrance at RAF Biggin Hill was dedicated to St George&#151;but less often in new statuary (the names of the dead of 1939&#150;45 were usually added to existing memorials) than in stained-glass windows in churches, where they inevitably made less impression on the public at large. The general decline in churchgoing, too, contributed to the growing indifference, as did the coincidence of St George's day with the day of William Shakespeare's death (and possible birth). The national saint lost ground to the national poet, and by 1947 the author and artist Laurence Whistler could comment that &#145;The celebration of &#147;the Birthday&#148; is now the main feature of St George's Day&#146;  (Whistler, 133). In John Masefield's verse drama <span class="italic">A Play of St George</span> (1948), set in the reign of Diocletian, George's links to the land of his future tutelary role are confined to a passing reference to &#145;A place called Londinium in South Britain&#146;  (p. 48).<br>
<br>During the 1950s and 1960s the Royal Society of St George (which received a royal charter of incorporation in 1963) worked to maintain interest in and knowledge of the English national saint, against a background of widespread apathy which the Roman Catholic church's demotion of George's cult to one of purely local observance in 1969 can have done nothing to dispel. He retained his traditional place in mummers' plays, but also his equally traditional confusion with King George, which can only have obscured his status. Thus in a performance recorded at Antrobus, Cheshire, on 12 November 1974, he announced himself at the outset:<blockquote>
<div>In come I, King George, the champion bold,<br>
</div>
<div>I won ten thousand pound in gold.<br>
</div>
<div>'Twas I that fought the fiery dragon and brought it to a slaughter,<br>
</div>
<div>And by these deeds won the King of Egypt's daughter.<br>
</div> (Green, 144&#150;5)</blockquote>Two years earlier, however, the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community (31 December 1972) had helped to fuel emotions which did much to recast the image of St George, albeit in an overtly militaristic and xenophobic mould which found little space for traditional associations with chivalric gallantry. Here a leading role was taken by the League of St George, founded in 1975, which was overtly hostile to outsiders and foreigners of all kinds, and made much of the threat allegedly posed to Britain's (as much as England's) national identity by immigration. The incongruity of the choice of name, given that George is also widely honoured on the continent (for instance as the patron of Catalonia and of the Greek army) and in the Middle East, by both Eastern Orthodox and Coptic Christians and by Muslims, was overlooked.<br>
<br>The impact of the League of St George was never more than local and ephemeral, but in the 1990s the saint's cause was taken up again, now with the support of sections of the media&#151;in 1998 <span class="italic">The Sun</span> launched a campaign to revive the observance of St George's day. The decade 1984&#150;94 saw a substantial increase in the number of boys given the first name George (from 804 to 3907), and in 1995 it became possible to buy cards marking 23 April&#151;50,000 were being sold each year by the end of the century. The principal force behind these developments was less religion, however, than continued anxiety over national identity, now fuelled not only by racism but also by hostility towards the European Union (as the European Economic Community became in 1992) and fears that it aimed to create a European &#145;superstate&#146;, and perhaps, too, by concerns for England's place in the United Kingdom at a time when its long-established primacy seemed to be threatened first by demands for, and then by the enactment of, Welsh and Scottish devolution. Indeed, despite the decision of its general synod in 1996 that St George's day should be one of the Church of England's twenty-eight major festivals, in the 1980s and 1990s the saint himself was less in evidence as a patriotic symbol than his banner, which became all too often associated with the violence of football hooligans and extreme nationalists. To some extent this was in keeping with popular perceptions of St George as above all a soldier and dragon-killer, his initial status as a martyr having been almost entirely forgotten. Yet despite this warlike image, he has also continued to be linked by name to beneficent institutions of all kinds, to hospitals and charities as well as churches, and thus to functions in keeping with those gentler aspects of his legend which tell of his rescuing an imperilled princess and saving heathen souls. That this should be so illustrates the extent to which that legend has over the centuries gathered a rich variety of elements, which in their turn have enabled St George to show himself a protean figure, capable of continuous adaptation. At the beginning of the twenty-first century there is every reason to suppose that this process will continue.<br>
