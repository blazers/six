<span class="headword">Piercy,  Benjamin</span>  (1827&#150;1888), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Cilcain, Flintshire, on 16 March 1827, the third son of Robert Piercy (1773&#150;1855), surveyor, road contractor, and valuer, and his wife, Arabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. His birthplace is often cited as Trefeglwys, Montgomeryshire, probably a family home, where his elder brother Robert Piercy (1825&#150;1894), also a civil engineer, was born. He was trained as a surveyor in his father's office and then became chief assistant to the surveyor and land agent Charles Mickleburgh of Montgomery. He studied railway engineering in his spare time. His first practical work in this field was for the railway engineer Henry Robertson, who is said to have engaged the young Piercy in making the parliamentary surveys for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway. This line included the construction of the nineteen-arch Dee Viaduct in 1846&#150;8, which at 1508 feet (459.6 metres) long and 147 feet (44.8 metres) high was the largest then built. Robertson employed Piercy on two of the early surveys for lines between Oswestry and Newtown in mid-Wales.<br>
<br>In 1852&#150;3 Piercy independently prepared the engineering plans for the Shrewsbury and Welshpool Railway and is credited with pushing the project through parliament, although the authorizing act for the present railway was not passed until 1856. He married, on 19 September 1855, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of Thomas Davies, farmer, of Montgomery, with whom he had three sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Piercy first became associated with the influential Welsh railway contractors David Davies and Thomas Savin during the construction of the Vale of Clwyd Railway in 1857&#150;8. He then joined them as engineer of the Oswestry and Newtown Railway after the death of the original engineer, Rice Hopkins, in 1858. He probably designed the Italianate three companies headquarters building at Llanidloes that was constructed in 1864 after the completion of the Mid-Wales Railway. On the linked Oswestry and Newtown Railway, his elder brother joined him in what became a long partnership, both joining Savin and Davies as resident engineers under the engineer Joseph Cubitt in 1857. The fine French-style pavilioned station at Welshpool, the company headquarters in 1860&#150;61, is often said (like Oswestry station) to be Piercy's design. In 1860 Piercy was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and by 1861 all the mid-Wales railway companies and Piercy himself had moved their offices to Westminster.<br>
<br>Piercy's work with Davies, taking the continuation of these lines through the Cambrian Mountains to the coast by the construction of the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway, launched his international engineering career. Work started in 1859 with Piercy as engineer on the mountain summit section at Talerddig. The original plan was for a tunnel but the contractors altered this when it was realized what a large quantity of stone and materials was required for the succession of bridge and earthworks needed to cross ravines on the sharp descent to the coast. The 120 foot cutting was the deepest in the world, and the railway was completed at moderate cost, both of which facts attracted international attention. Below the summit the railway was actually carried over the bed of the Wynnstay stream in a 450 foot continuous arch because of the restricted terrain.<br>
<br>In 1862 the Anglo-Italian Royal Sardinian Railway Company sought the advice of Piercy and Davies. The concession involved the construction of 250 miles of railways on the island of Sardinia. Plans and sections had already been prepared by Italian engineers working for the Baratelli Company. These plans included 20 miles of tunnels and very heavy earthworks through the mountainous terrain and there was no local contractor willing to undertake the construction within the time allowed under the concession or within the funds available. Piercy, with Davies's help, resurveyed the projected railways and considerably reduced the engineering involved. Piercy also won the contract for engineering of the Napol&eacute;on-Vend&eacute;e railway between Tours and Bressuire and on to the Vend&eacute;e coast at Les Sables d'Olonne, a distance of 160 miles (257 kilometres), construction taking place between 1862 and 1866.<br>
<br>In Wales, Piercy and Savin concluded the construction of the missing link on what became the Cambrian coast mainline by engineering the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway to Pwllheli in 1862&#150;7. Considerable engineering features included the cliff-edge line at Y Friog around the western flank of the Cadair Idris massif and the designs for two very large estuary viaducts over the Dyfi and Mawddach. Unfortunately borings failed to locate firm foundations for the former, and a diversion line was built. The 2,400 foot 113-span length of the latter, carried on 500 timber piles, was the longest in Wales but was completed by another engineer after Piercy supported the losing side in a boardroom battle. The company headquarters station in <i>cottage orn&eacute;</i> style at Machynlleth may have been designed by Piercy.<br>
<br>Other railways for which Piercy is credited with the engineering in the 1860s include three more sections linked or near to his mid-Wales and border lines: the Mid-Wales Railway (Caersws to Talgarth, 1859&#150;64); the Hereford, Hay, and Brecon Railway (1861&#150;4); and the Oswestry, Ellesmere, and Whitchurch Railway (1863&#150;4), with a simplified Italianate headquarters station at Ellesmere. Lines in north Wales and the borders included the Denbigh, Ruthin, and Corwen Railway (1862&#150;4); the Bishops Castle Railway (1865); the Hoylake Railway (Birkenhead&#150;Hoylake, 1866); the Wrexham, Mold, and Connahs Quay Railway (1862&#150;6); the Buckley Railway (1865&#150;6); and the Caernarvonshire Railway (Caernarfon&#150;Menai Bridge, 1866&#150;7).<br>
<br>In Sardinia work on the easier sections of the railways had almost been completed by British contractors in 1865 when it was stopped until 1869 by the outbreak of war between Italy and Austria. Piercy was then recalled by the Royal Sardinian Railway Company. He negotiated a new finance agreement with the Italian government under which the 197 kilometres of line already started were to be completed by 1874. For some months he revitalized construction, acting as contractor before returning to his role as engineer-in-chief in Sardinia in 1870&#150;79, assisted by his elder brother Robert, also an engineer. These lines were largely completed by 1872. The 194 kilometres of more difficult lines over the mountains were then completed by 1880&#150;81. As an afterthought he was asked to construct a heavily engineered 27 kilometre line to the new port of Golfo di Aranci, where he also designed a mole and other harbour works.<br>
<br>Piercy was given land on his first visit to Sardinia in 1862. He returned for a brief supervisory visit in 1865 and then after an initial period working in India settled on the island for the eleven years from 1870 to 1881; some of his nine children were born there. In 1879&#150;83 he accommodated his wife and his large family in his new four-towered Anglo-Italian style Villa Piercy on his 3700 hectare Badde Salighes estate (between Bolotana and Bonorva) at the highest point of his railway network (of which he was also a shareholder). He sought to improve the economic development of the island by applying the latest technological principles to agriculture and mining and became a substantial entrepreneur. He bought land throughout the island from Chia to Palau. He constructed over 50 miles of roads on his estates and built a dairy and cheese factory using the latest technology and interbred Welsh and Sardinian animals. Earlier in his career he had constructed railways connecting with the Ffestiniog Railway, then pioneering steam locomotion on mountainous railways, and he outlined plans for a possible additional 2000 kilometres of lines in the mountains of the more remote parts of Sardinia, a significant part of which were subsequently built. His efforts attracted the attention of Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose son Ricciotti became Piercy's godson and later his apprentice in India. In recognition of his service King Umberto of Italy made him a commander of the Italian Crown and there were several royal visits to his estates. Umberto later called on Piercy to improve the water supply (rebuilding the Aqua Marcia) of the Italian capital and also to canalize the River Tiber through Rome.<br>
<br>In 1879 Piercy and his brother began building the 90 mile Assam Railway through the tea plantations and up to the coalmines, which the Piercys substantially developed together with the associated petroleum springs.<br>
<br>Piercy returned to Wales in 1881 and acquired Marchwiel Hall to the south of Wrexham. He pushed forward the development of north-east Wales in tandem with Henry Robertson and developed its links to the port of Liverpool. He offered to stand as a Liberal candidate at a parliamentary by-election in Peterborough in 1883, but withdrew to avoid splitting the Liberal vote. After attending a dinner of the City of London Gold and Silver Wire Drawers' Company Piercy contracted bronchopneumonia and died of that and cardiac failure at his London home, 15 Portman Square, on 24 March 1888. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Britain was the source of international ideas for railway development between 1830 and about 1860. Piercy is especially important for exporting the lessons learned in effective railway engineering in the mountains of Wales, for standard and narrow-gauge practice, to other areas of Europe and to Asia. He was unusual in becoming resident in a particular area of continental Europe and playing a critical role in its railway and economic development. His legacy is in the great engineering works he designed at Talerddig, Y Friog, and Barmouth in mid-Wales and the entire mountainous railway network of Sardinia. Among the various buildings attributed to Piercy with varying degrees of certainty are the surviving and impressive headquarter stations of Llanidloes, Machynlleth, and Ellesmere, and many of those in Sardinia. The Villa Piercy and its estates were expropriated in 1953 after a perceived conflict between British and Italian trust laws, but the building survives surrounded by the forests of Welsh and Sardinian trees planted by Piercy. Piercy's descendents live elsewhere on an island where his contributions to its economic development are still treated with considerable respect.<br>
