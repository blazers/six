<span class="headword">Leatham,  James</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">political activist and publisher</span>, was born on 19 December 1865, the youngest of five children of Stephen Leatham, an army sergeant from Yorkshire, and his Scottish wife, Margaret Cattanach, a hand-loom weaver. His father died shortly after his birth and he was raised in the Rosemount area of Aberdeen by his mother and her parents in a literate, self-improving home environment where education was valued. He attended Northfield public school, where he attained dux at age ten, followed by two and a half years at Dr Brown's school, Skene Square, where he was briefly a pupil monitor. Fascinated by the world of printing and publishing, at thirteen years and eleven months he became apprentice compositor with a local firm, with whom he progressed to journeyman and then foreman until 1888, when he was sacked for leading the printers' union campaign against dilution and cheap labour. He had recently (23 December 1887) married Isabella Sinclair Duncan (1862/3&#150;1947), a linen manufacturer's machinist, the daughter of James Duncan, a flax mill overseer, and fathered the first of their four daughters.<br>
<br>From his teenage years Leatham was a political activist; initially as an ardent secularist, developing and expanding his views in literary and debating societies, and, as a leading light in Aberdeen Junior Liberal Association, organizing public meetings and lecturing on radical and collectivist themes. From the mid-1880s, increasingly influenced by the socialist writings of Lawrence Gronlund, Edward Bellamy, Peter Kropotkin, and, especially, William Morris, he became a convinced socialist. An evolutionary socialist with fundamental but non-doctrinaire views, he was committed to building an open, informed, mass membership party, aiming at a maximum socialist programme of nationalization and municipal ownership, to be achieved through political representation and popular enlightenment.<br>
<br>Already a militant trade unionist, from 1888 until 1893 Leatham was principal standard bearer of the emerging socialist left in Aberdeen, leading the local branch of the Scottish Land and Labour League and latterly the Aberdeen Socialist Society, which merged into the Social Democratic Federation. Between 1889 and 1892 he ran a small printing and publishing co-operative, selling progressive and socialist literature, including his own very popular propagandist pamphlets, such as <span class="italic">The Eight Hour Day</span> and <span class="italic">The Class War</span>. In the winter of 1891&#150;2 he produced <span class="italic">Workers Herald</span>, the first, though short-lived, avowedly socialist weekly paper in Scotland.<br>
<br>Leatham's growing reputation as a socialist propagandist and organizer created a wider demand for his political services throughout Scotland and beyond. Between 1893 and 1896 he worked in Manchester as a compositor in the large publishing firm of Heywoods, while otherwise immersing himself in lecturing, journalism, and building Lancashire branches of the Social Democratic Federation and Independent Labour Party (ILP). In Manchester he continued as a highly effective organizer of the printing trades and led the agitation that achieved shorter hours for 4000 workers. Again he was victimized, and he briefly worked full time for the Social Democratic Federation throughout the north of England.<br>
<br>Leatham returned to north-east Scotland in 1896 to edit&#150;manage the struggling weekly paper <span class="italic">Peterhead Sentinel</span>, which he transformed into a lively production with a popular literary, anti-imperialist, and socialist slant. Nearby, from his Clerkhill Press, he concentrated, between 1905 and 1908, on writing, printing, and publishing a prolific output of pamphlets and longer works on literary and historical themes, always from consciously rationalist and socialist viewpoints. His talents as a socialist journalist and writer were further recognized when, in 1908, he was appointed editor&#150;manager of the Worker Press, a group of ILP weekly newspapers in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His main charges were the <span class="italic">Huddersfield Worker</span> and the <span class="italic">Halifax Labour News</span>, and he was latterly also involved in producing the <span class="italic">Leeds and District Weekly Citizen</span> and the <span class="italic">Manchester Weekly Citizen</span>. He resigned after failing to win shareholder support to extend the specialist socialist publishing side of the firm.<br>
<br>Thereafter between 1912 and 1916 Leatham became a resolutely independent socialist printer and publisher, operating from his Cottingham Press in the East Riding of Yorkshire and from the Deveron Press in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, where he finally settled in 1916. From 1912 until his death Leatham's own periodical, <span class="italic">Gateway</span>, was his principal propagandist weapon, discoursing on politics, current affairs, literature, and cultural issues. Throughout a long career Leatham always made a precarious living from printing and publishing ventures. A prodigious journalist and a clear, direct prose stylist he wrote several books, including the delightful tribute <span class="italic">William Morris: Master of many Crafts</span> (1899; 4th edn, 1934), and a host of titles in pamphlet form, issued from his own presses.<br>
<br>Although highly critical of the record of Labour governments in 1924 and 1929&#150;31 Leatham was elected a Labour councillor for Turriff in 1923. He also served as a leading county councillor in Aberdeenshire and as a justice of the peace. In his twelve final years he was provost of Turriff. His greatest achievements in a distinguished late career in civic life were in municipal housing, public health, and welfare provision. Leatham was appointed MBE in 1942 for his services to local government. He died at his home, 7 Hillcrest, Turriff, Aberdeenshire, on 14 December 1945 after two heart attacks, and was buried in the graveyard of St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen.<br>
