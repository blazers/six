<span class="headword">Collins,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1634), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Surrey, and matriculated as a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, about 1591, where he gained a fellowship on Lady Margaret's foundation on 7 April 1598. He proceeded BA in 1596 and MA in 1599. From 1600 to 1604 he was Linacre lecturer at St John's while pursuing his MD. The college then gave him leave to &#145;travaile [three years] beyond the seas for his increase in learning&#146;  (Baker, 457). It is unclear where he studied, but he returned in 1608 and received his MD. On 8 November 1626 he succeeded John Gostlin as regius professor of physick.<br>
<br>Collins was the first regius professor who was also a fellow of the London College of Physicians, having been admitted a candidate &#145;the day after Palm Sunday&#146; 1611  (&#145;Annals&#146;, vol. 3, fol. 7). He became a fellow on 7 May 1613, censor in 1615, and anatomy lecturer in 1624. This last post was also held at times by William Harvey. Although they were contemporaries and colleagues Collins seems not to have been persuaded by Harvey's theory of circulation, thus affirming Harvey's famous statement that no one over forty years of age accepted his views. It would be incorrect, however, to dismiss Collins's medical thought as entirely traditional. There is evidence that he was influenced by Paracelsian chemical theory and prescribed mercury  (Webster, 11). He was also responsible for establishing &#145;anatomies&#146; (dissections) as a required part of the Cambridge medical curriculum in 1627. The original Grace and an eyewitness account of an anatomy during Collins's tenure survive  (Heywood and Wright, 2.358&#150;9, 364).<br>
<br>In 1630 Cambridge suffered a severe outbreak of plague. Collins and vice-chancellor Henry Butts were responsible for handling the crisis. They organized and administered the policy of isolation and had a pest-house built on Midsummer Common. Collins and Butts apparently enforced the quarantine strictly, since the fellow Joseph Mede complained, &#145;You see what it is to have a physician among the heads. We cannot have leave to scarce take the aire&#146;  (Birch, 1.47). It seems that degree requirements could be flexible at such times of emergency when students had to disperse on short notice. Collins would later acknowledge this when he differentiated between degrees &#145;<i>pestilentae</i>&#146; and &#145;<i>eminentae</i>&#146; (&#145;of the plague&#146; and &#145;of prominence&#146;; Fuller, 166). In 1634 the registrar of the College of Physicians wrote to Collins complaining of the lax degree requirements at Cambridge. The main complaint of the college concerned the practice of granting degrees and licences to foreign trained practitioners who lacked, as the college saw it, proper training. Caught between his two professional affiliations Collins wrote an impassioned plea to his friend William Clement acknowledging the problem but confessing he was powerless to change such a long-standing practice  (&#145;Annals&#146;, vol. 3, fol. 147). On 7 August 1616 Collins was licensed to marry Judith Easton, a widow. Collins died at Cambridge in December 1634 and was buried in the chapel of St John's College on the 14th. By his will, dated 8 December and proved on 24 December, he bequeathed most of his &#145;phisick books&#146; to St John's College, and &pound;100 to buy more  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/166/108).<br>
