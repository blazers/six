<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  George</span>  (1877&#150;1963), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 28 January 1877 at Bedford House, near Listowel in co. Kerry, Ireland, the tenth of twelve children of the Revd George Fitzmaurice (1822&#150;1891) and Winifred O'Connor (1842&#150;1919). The playwright's arrival coincided with the decline of an old and respected Anglo-Irish family. His father, a younger son, was a minister in the Church of Ireland who, having married a Gaelic-speaking Catholic on his estate, seems to have hastened the collapse of the Fitzmaurice dynasty. He abandoned the ministry after nine years and led the life of a country gentleman, gradually selling off the 500 acres he had inherited. George junior, like all his siblings, was educated at home; and like them, he never married. His father died when George was fourteen, and the family moved closer to his mother's people in Duagh, where farming became the mainstay.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice was now in a most unusual position. As the product of a mixed marriage he had little social status. He was among the Gaelic-speaking people to a far greater degree than was John Millington Synge (the writer with whom he is most often compared) but alienated in rather similar ways from the peasant Catholic majority. His lack of formal education left him at a distinct disadvantage when it became necessary for him to take up employment, and the best he could do, after a brief sojourn in a bank in Cork before 1900, was as temporary clerk in the civil service (congested districts board) in Dublin. Fitzmaurice remained a clerk all his working life from 1901 until retirement in 1942.<br>
<br>During all his years in Dublin Fitzmaurice made no friends. He was a small, shy, retiring figure who lived alone. Yet he obviously felt himself early to be a writer, for he had five stories published in Irish weekly journals by 1901. These, posthumously collected with four others under the title <span class="italic">The Crows of Mephistopheles</span> (1970), indicate Fitzmaurice's ear for the richness of Kerry speech and his insight into the intrigues surrounding matchmaking. <span class="italic">The Country Dressmaker</span> (1907), the first of his plays to be accepted by the Abbey Theatre, was based on one of these early short stories, &#145;Maeve's Grand Lover&#146;. It concerns matchmaking in the north Kerry area, where all but two of Fitzmaurice's seventeen plays are set. The success of the play was something of a surprise; Yeats had expected it to cause riots in the manner of Synge's <span class="italic">Playboy of the Western World</span> because of its satiric portrayal of the peasantry. Its handling of the romantic dreams of the eponymous dressmaker, however, disillusioned by the sight of her fianc&eacute; after his ten years' wear and tear in America, proved immensely popular, and the play was often revived down to the year 1949. Indeed, nothing Fitzmaurice subsequently wrote achieved comparable success.<br>
<br>Yet <span class="italic">The Country Dressmaker</span> reads now as a fairly conventional three-act Abbey comedy. The real interest of Fitzmaurice's dramatic work lies in the strange folk plays he began to write with <span class="italic">The Pie Dish</span> (1908) and <span class="italic">The Magic Glasses</span> (1913), one-act allegories of the frustrated artist out of his element in the idyllic Irish landscape. This turn in his writing occurred during a long unemployed period in Duagh, the result of illness and suspension between January 1909 and December 1913 (when he was reinstated). Comic though these pieces are, with larger-than-life, colourful characters gifted with outlandish eloquence, they end with the tragic deaths of the artist figures. Audiences were mystified by <span class="italic">The Magic Glasses</span>, and the Abbey subsequently rejected <span class="italic">The Dandy Dolls</span>, a delightful fantasy in which the fairy world mingles mischievously with human fancy and obsession. These plays, together with <span class="italic">The Moonlighter</span>, a political tragedy, were published in <span class="italic">Five Plays</span> (1914, 1917) in Dublin and Boston. Fitzmaurice joined the British army in 1914 and served in France as a private until 1919. The Ireland he returned to would have thought little of his sacrifice while nationalists fought for independence. Resuming his clerkship, Fitzmaurice failed to get promoted to &#145;graded&#146; status before the change of government administration in 1922. He seems to have achieved this in 1925, becoming a clerical officer in the department of agriculture and fisheries.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice's next play, <span class="italic">'Twixt the Giltenans and the Carmodys</span> (1923), reverting to the realistic, matchmaking theme of his first success, was a grievous disappointment. He now retreated into obscurity and eccentricity where, like one of his own obsessive characters, he preferred to live. Rejected by the Abbey, he wrote fantasies in which realistic characters inhabit a world of folklore and magic. Music-hall entertainment, of which he was fond, may have influenced the form of these fantasies. The wonder plays of Lady Gregory and the fanciful plays of Jack B. Yeats also offer themselves as counterparts, but Fitzmaurice's tone and style are unique. The plays are whimsical but they are also intense, subversive, and to a degree satirical. Most of them were published by his friend Seumas O'Sullivan in <span class="italic">The Dublin Magazine</span>, and Fitzmaurice discouraged their production on stage. He seems to have written nothing during the 1930s. When the poet Austin Clarke rediscovered Fitzmaurice in the 1940s it was a major task to persuade him to allow the staging of <span class="italic">The Dandy Dolls</span> and other pieces by Clarke's Lyric Players. Fitzmaurice shunned others who likewise showed signs of interest, whether in radio or stage production.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice was rediscovered yet again after his death, when the American scholar Howard K. Slaughter oversaw the publication in 1967 of all seventeen plays in three volumes, after which the Abbey renewed its interest and staged several of the plays, most recently <span class="italic">The Enchanted Sea</span> (1976). A new generation was introduced to Fitzmaurice by the Druid Theatre Company's productions of <span class="italic">The Ointment Blue</span> and <span class="italic">There are Tragedies and Tragedies</span> in Galway in 1993.<br>
<br>Yet Fitzmaurice remains an enigma. When he died of natural causes in his room at 3 Harcourt Street, Dublin, on 12 May 1963 he was virtually unknown. He left little behind him to assist biographers: no diary, very few letters, no will. There is but one photograph of him, a pencil drawing, and an oil portrait by Harry Kernoff. Fitzmaurice described himself as neurasthenic, which at times made him &#145;a border-line case&#146;  (Slaughter, 40). There were very few people at his funeral. After a service in St Peter's Church, Aungier Street, on 16 May Fitzmaurice was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery in Dublin. In spite of various attempts to accord him major status he seems doomed to remain an intermittently remembered minor writer.<br>
