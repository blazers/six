<span class="headword">Swanston,  Eyllaerdt</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was a member of the prestigious King's Men from about 1624 until the closure of the theatres in 1642. We do not know his parentage or when or where he was born. There are more than twenty variant spellings of his unusual forename, and at least ten of his surname. Our first record is of his marriage to Alice Ivieson (<i>d</i>. 1651) on 16 December 1619 in the parish of St Gregory by St Paul's, London. He and his wife lived in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, whose registers record the baptisms of ten of their children between 3 September 1620 and 21 January 1639.<br>
<br>Although Swanston spent most of his professional life with the King's Men, he was not one of those &#145;bred from Children in the kings service&#146;  (&#145;Dramatic records&#146;, 371). He is to be found first with the Prince Charles's Players and with the Lady Elizabeth's Men. A list of the chief actors at the Phoenix made in 1622 includes Swanston, so he must by then have been an experienced actor. The Phoenix was a well-known theatre in Drury Lane. Swanston joined the King's Men some time before 20 December 1624, as on that date he and a number of other members of that company signed an apology to the master of the revels for performing <span class="italic">The Spanish Viceroy</span> without a licence. Almost ten years later Swanston again apologized to the authorities, this time for problems over censorship. &#145;Ellyart Swanstone&#146; was one of fifteen King's players issued with black cloth for King James's funeral on 7 May 1625  (&#145;Dramatic records&#146;, 325&#150;6). The royal patent of 24 June the same year lists &#145;Elliart Swanston&#146; as one of King Charles's well-beloved servants  (&#145;Royal patents&#146;, 282). Livery lists pertaining to the King's Men and dating from May 1629, April 1637, and March 1641 all include his name in diverse forms.<br>
<br>The King's Men performed an extensive and varied repertoire. Shakespeare's plays were revived regularly. An early theatrical chronicler, James Wright, tells us that Swanston played Othello but none of his other Shakespearian roles have been identified. Of his known roles three are in plays by Philip Massinger: Aretinus Clemens in <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> (performed in 1626), Ricardo in <span class="italic">The Picture</span> (performed in 1629), and Chrysalus in <span class="italic">Believe as you List</span> (performed in 1631). About the same time he also played Count Utrante in Lodowick Carlell's <span class="italic">The Deserving Favourite</span>, Alcidonus in Arthur Wilson's <span class="italic">The Swisser</span>, and Lugier in <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chase</span>, a revival of a &#145;Beaumont and Fletcher&#146; play. Other roles that can be assigned to him are Bussy D'Ambois, the hero of George Chapman's tragedy, and Philaster in Fletcher's tragicomedy. Swanston also appeared in John Ford's <span class="italic">The Lovers' Melancholy</span> (performed in 1628).<br>
<br>As a leading player and shareholder Swanston often acted for the company in financial matters. From 1632 to 1641 he, with his colleagues John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, regularly received the payments for the King's Men's frequent performances at court. In 1635 he and fellow King's Men Robert Benfield and Thomas Pollard petitioned the lord chamberlain for permission to purchase shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres. The surviving members of the Burbage family and John Shank, another colleague, objected, but the request was granted. However, no agreement could be reached, and eventually, as the &#145;Sharers' Papers&#146; show, the matter was referred for arbitration to the master of the revels. Shank died in January 1636 with the matter unresolved. On 26 August 1639 Richard Benfield, Robert's kinsman, left bequests both to Swanston and to members of Shank's family.<br>
<br>During the civil war, perhaps surprisingly, Swanston seems not to have supported King Charles. According to James Wright, &#145;he profest himself a Presbyterian, took up the trade of a Jeweller, and liv'd in Aldermanbury&#146;  (Wright, 409). His alliance with the parliamentarians is confirmed by the statement in <span class="italic">A Key to the Parliament by their Remembrancer</span> (1648) that Swanston the player was one of them. During the interregnum a folio collection of the plays attributed to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher was published. Swanston was one of the King's Men who signed the dedicatory epistle of the 1647 volume. He is also mentioned in one of its prefatory poems, Henry Vaughan's &#145;Upon Mr Fletcher's Playes, Published 1647&#146;. Swanston made his will on 24 June 1651 and was buried, together with his wife, in St Mary Aldermanbury, London, on the 28th.<br>
<br>In a scene in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Virtuoso</span> (performed in 1676) the theatre of &#145;the last Age&#146; is compared unfavourably with the contemporary theatre. To Snarl, one of the participants in the debate, modern actors seem too tame when compared with the great King's Men of old: &#145;I, that have seen Joseph Taylor, and Lowin and Swanstead; Oh a brave roaring Fellow! Would make the house shake again&#146;  (Shadwell, <span class="italic">The Virtuoso</span>, 1691, 10). Although Swanston is scarcely known today, he was an important actor in his day and his reputation survived well into the Restoration period.<br>
