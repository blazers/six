<span class="headword">Nairne,  David</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobite Sir David Nairne, first baronet]</span>  (1655&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Jacobite courtier</span>, was born in August 1655 at Sandford, Fife, and baptized on 7 September 1655 at St Phillins Church in St Andrews. He was the second of the four sons of Thomas Nairne (<i>d</i>. before 1672), laird of Sandford, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1716), daughter of Sir David Barclay of Collarnie. After graduating from St Andrews University in 1673 he studied law at the universities of Leiden, Franeker, and Utrecht from 1674 to 1676. He visited Paris at the end of 1676 to learn French and decided to settle there permanently. He was converted to Catholicism in 1680.<br>
<br>It is not known how Nairne occupied himself during his early years in France, as he failed to secure any permanent employment. In March 1686 he obtained a small annual pension from Louis XIV, and on 17 September of that year he married Marie-Elisabeth de Compigny (1659/60&#150;1715). He was still unemployed in the winter of 1688&#150;9, when James II was forced into exile at St Germain by William of Orange. On the recommendation of Lewis Innes, the principal of the Coll&egrave;ge des &Eacute;cossais in Paris, Nairne was recruited by James II's secretary of state, Lord Melfort, to be his under-secretary, and he accompanied Melfort to Ireland in 1689 and then on his Rome embassy from 1689 to 1691.<br>
<br>At the end of 1691 Melfort returned to St Germain and for the next year and a half Nairne was kept very busy there as his under-secretary, but the arrival of Lord Middleton as joint secretary of state in 1693, with his own under-secretary, greatly reduced the correspondence which passed through Nairne's hands. He had, however, established a reputation for efficiency and honesty, so when Melfort was forced to resign in 1694 Nairne was retained as under-secretary by his successor, John Caryll.<br>
<br>By 1696 Nairne had succeeded in winning the complete confidence of James II and Mary of Modena, who entrusted to him their most secret correspondence. In February of that year the queen appointed Nairne to be clerk of her council, and in March and April he spent nine weeks with the king at Calais while James was preparing to invade England. The two men were drawn together by their strong religious faith, and when James II established the Confraternity for a Happy Death (Bona Morte) in the chapel at St Germain Nairne joined it in April 1698. Two days later Nairne was confirmed at Notre Dame de Paris. About the same time James II gave Nairne a secret additional pension.<br>
<br>The treaty of Ryswick greatly reduced the political work of the secretariat at St Germain, and from 1697 to 1703 Nairne was largely employed in helping Caryll translate parts of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into English for use at the Jacobite court. In 1697 they translated the book of <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and from 1697 to 1702 the entire <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, but only the psalms were ever published (under Caryll's name in 1700) and their other translations have not survived. From 1699 to 1701 Nairne and Caryll also wrote <span class="italic">The Life of James II</span> up to the year 1677 (published in 1816), and when the king died in 1701 Nairne arranged and copied his papers and helped supervise the writing and publication of P&egrave;re Bretonneau's <span class="italic">Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de la vie de Jacques II</span> in 1703.<br>
<br>These literary activities came to an end in June 1703 when Lord Middleton's under-secretary returned to Scotland and Nairne was entrusted with his duties. He played an increasingly important role in advising Lord Middleton, and thus Mary of Modena and the young James III (James Francis Edward Stuart). He was appointed clerk of the king's council in June 1706 and accompanied James during his attempted invasion of Scotland in 1708 and then during his campaigns in Flanders in 1708 and 1709.<br>
<br>Nairne continued to work for Caryll until the latter's death in 1711, after which Lord Middleton took over all the Jacobite political correspondence. When James III left St Germain in 1712 to take up residence in Lorraine he was accompanied by both Middleton and Nairne, but the former increasingly delegated his work to Nairne, who mainly corresponded with the Jacobites in Great Britain before and after the treaty of Utrecht. When Middleton resigned in December 1713 Nairne began to work directly for James III rather than the new secretary of state. He was given the title of secretary of the closet for the king's private letters and dispatches, and was entrusted with the correspondence with the court of Rome. He also continued to handle the most secret correspondence with the Jacobites in England, and played an important role in advising James III during the negotiations for a possible restoration in 1714.<br>
<br>Nairne remained James III's most trusted adviser for the next four years and accompanied him to Scotland at the end of 1715. After the failure of the Scottish rising, when James was obliged to live at Avignon (1716&#150;17) and then in the Papal States, Nairne's responsibility for all the Jacobite correspondence with the court of Rome gave him a particularly important role. He worked successfully with Gualterio, the cardinal protector of England, and this greatly helped the Jacobites, most of them protestant, when they first took refuge in papal territory.<br>
<br>Nairne was with James III when he visited Rome from May to July 1717 and he then accompanied him to Urbino, where the Jacobite court was established from July 1717 until the end of 1718. While he was at Urbino Nairne's position was weakened, as James III came completely under the influence of his new secretary of state (the Jacobite duke of Mar) and his relations and friends. They turned James against his old advisers and persuaded him to reject his entire St Germain background. As a result the other old servants gradually left the court and Nairne became an isolated figure, but he remained indispensable because he was the only Jacobite who could correspond and negotiate in both Italian and French.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1718, when Maria Clementina Sobieska, princess of Poland, was arrested by the emperor to stop her marrying James, Nairne was sent to Rome, where he obtained the diplomatic support of the pope. He also negotiated the transfer of the Jacobite court from Urbino to the papal capital, which resulted in the acquisition for the Stuarts of the Palazzo Muti.<br>
<br>In February 1719 James III left Rome secretly to join the planned Spanish invasion of England. Nairne was created a baronet by James and left behind to break the news to the pope and look after Jacobite interests at Rome, in conjunction with Cardinal Gualterio. But Nairne lost his independence when he was placed under the authority of James III's new favourite, James Murray, a much younger man with whom his relations were already strained. By the time James III returned from Spain Nairne was very discontented and keen to retire to France. He was not invited to James's wedding with Maria Clementina Sobieska at Montefiascone in August, and when he joined them shortly afterwards he was informed that thenceforth Murray would replace him as the liaison with Cardinal Gualterio. He was retained as secretary of the closet because he was still the only Jacobite who was fluent in French and Italian, and partly also because, as a Catholic, he was trusted at the papal court.<br>
<br>For the next few years Nairne continued to carry out general secretarial duties for James III, but he no longer dealt with political questions. Although he repeatedly asked to retire, he was not allowed to do so, and he accompanied James to Bologna in 1726 following the separation from Maria Clementina. He remained there until James's return to Rome in 1729, when he finally retired, but was not allowed to return to Paris until the end of 1733.<br>
<br>Nairne and his wife had nine children, of whom only one son and two daughters survived. His wife had died in March 1715, while he was in Lorraine, and his son had joined the Spanish army. His elder daughter became a Benedictine nun in Paris in 1731 and his younger married in June 1735 the chevalier Andrew Ramsay, who was created a baronet by James III at Nairne's request. Nairne and Ramsay were in very close contact and perhaps even lodging together when the latter wrote his celebrated masonic <span class="italic">Discours</span> in 1737. It is probable that Nairne was one of the first freemasons at St Germain and that he had introduced Ramsay to freemasonry when they had first met at Rome in 1724.<br>
<br>Nairne was of small stature and had a scar on the left side of his chin, the result of a student duel in 1675. He was modest and unassuming to a fault and would have had and retained much more influence with James III if he had been a better courtier. He was a man of wide culture and a talented musician. Nairne is best known because he assembled an important collection of papers and brought them with him when he returned to Paris. After his death there in January 1740 they were left in the Coll&egrave;ge des &Eacute;cossais, whence they were stolen by Thomas Carte in 1742, published in Macpherson's <span class="italic">Original Papers</span> in 1775, and given to the Bodleian Library in 1778. As the archives of the Stuart court at St Germain were virtually all destroyed during the French Revolution, historians of the politics of that court are still obliged to rely heavily on Nairne's papers.<br>
