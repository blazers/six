<span class="headword">Peer,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1713), <span class="occ">actor and property man</span>, whose origins are obscure, served as a property man in London in 1659&#150;60, according to <span class="italic">The Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses &hellip; and other Stage Personnel in London</span>. His earliest known role was with the Duke's Company, Pecus in Ferdinando Parkhurst's <span class="italic">Ignoramus, or, The Academical Lawyer</span>, which was presented at court in November 1662. Peer seems to have moved to Dublin for several years following this initial engagement. William Smith Clark states that he played a servant in John Wilson's <span class="italic">Belphegor</span> in the Dublin playhouse, Smock Alley, though &#145;he moved [back] to Drury Lane about the fall of 1679 and eventually assumed the post of property man there&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 82).<br>
<br>Perhaps because of his duties as props man Peer played only a few roles after he returned to London, as far as we know. He played Jasper in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Scowrers</span> in December 1690 and then the Presbyterian parson in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Love for Money</span> in January 1691. When Thomas Betterton and other performers left the United Company in London in winter 1694&#150;5, Peer followed them and continued his career at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. He is listed as dresser at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket in March 1708, receiving a per diem wage of 4<i>s</i>. He played only one known role at this theatre, Second Ruffian in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> in October 1706.<br>
<br>Some contemporary writers believed that Peer was undeservedly relegated to small roles or kept off the stage altogether. Tom Brown's <span class="italic">Letters from the Dead to the Living</span> addresses Peer as:<blockquote>you, who must be honest, because your [<i>sic</i>] are so poor and a Man of Merit, because you never were promoted &hellip; For you, Sir &hellip; are one of the most ancient of his Majesty's Servants, under the denomination of a Player, and yet cannot advance above the delivering a scurvy Message, which the strutting Leaders of your House wou'd do much more aukardly. (Brown and others, 65)</blockquote>In a letter written probably about 1707, <span class="italic">The Post-Man Robb'd of his Mail</span> calls this actor &#145;honest <i>Will Pierre</i>, who has stood the Shock of so many Turns of State, so many revolutions, and Transmigrations, without advancing beyond a Property-Man&#146;  (Gildon, 266).<br>
<br>Peer died at some time before 15 June 1713, since he appears on that date in an eulogistic article by Richard Steele in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. This piece offers us the most detailed information available on Peer, noting that Peer excelled in two small parts: the speaker of the prologue to the play within <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and the Apothecary in Thomas Otway's version of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, entitled <span class="italic">The History and Fall of Caius Marius</span>. Steele states: &#145;It is no matter, say the Moralists, whether you act a Prince or a Beggar, the Business is to do your Part well&#146;  (Steele, 299). He further comments: &#145;It was an odd Excellence, and a very particular Circumstance this of <i>Peer's</i>, that his whole Action of Life depended upon speaking five Lines better than any Man else in the World&#146;  (ibid., 300). Unfortunately:<blockquote>in the Seventieth Year of his Age he grew fat, which rendered his Figure unfit for the Utterance of the five Lines abovementioned: He had now unfortunately lost the wan Distress necessary for the Countenance of the Apothecary, and was too jolly to speak the Prologue with the proper Humility. (ibid., 301)</blockquote>Steele writes that this loss of his parts contributed &#145;to the shortning his Days&#146;, though Peer had also been serving as a property man who was required to be &#145;always ready, in a Place appointed for him behind the Prompter, [with] all such Tools and Implements as are necessary in the Play &hellip; <i>Billetdoux</i>, Poison, false Mony, Thunderbolts, Daggers&#146;  (ibid., 300). Steele states that the theatre does not owe him any money except that for some miscellaneous props&#151;&#145;For Hire of six Case of Pistols&#146;, &#145;For Blood in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>&#146;&#151;amounting to 11<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>.  (ibid., 301).<br>
