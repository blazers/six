<span class="headword">Denton,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1533), <span class="occ">dean of Lichfield</span>, was educated at Eton College, before in 1486 going as a king's scholar to King's College, Cambridge, where he proceeded BA in 1489, and MA in 1492, becoming in due course a fellow in 1489 and bursar of the college in 1496/7 and 1498/1500. He subsequently studied canon law at Valence, where he earned a doctorate in that faculty. In 1505 he obtained licence to stand in the same degree at Cambridge. He became a royal chaplain, and was rewarded with various preferments, including a canonry at Windsor (1509), and prebends at Lichfield (1509), Salisbury (1510), and Lincoln (1514). He was also rector of several parishes, including St Olave's, Southwark.<br>
<br>In 1514 Denton went to France as almoner with Mary, the sister of Henry VIII, on her marriage to Louis XII, and attended her in France until her husband's death and her own return to England. He afterwards acted as her chancellor, and in 1525 visited France on some mission about her dowry. She showed great anxiety to promote him, and informed Wolsey that he had done her much service. In 1520 he was one of the royal chaplains, &#145;clothed in damask and satin&#146;, at the Field of Cloth of Gold. In 1522 his contribution of &pound;200 to the clerical subsidy-loan to the king attested both his loyalty and his wealth. In 1524 he formed part of a commission with Sir Ralph Egerton and Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, justice of the king's bench, to reform the government in the Irish pale on the cheap, and to settle Ireland's many internal disputes, particularly the feud between the earls of Ormond and Kildare. The commission worked diligently and apparently effectively to pacify the pale, and it replaced Ormond with Kildare as lord deputy. But their hopes of securing order without having to commit additional English resources proved vain, Kildare's personal ambitions and the chronically volatile situation in Ireland soon frustrating their ambitions.<br>
<br>Denton's next public employment was as chancellor to the council of Princess Mary, which, on the analogy of the previous councils of Prince Edward, son of Edward IV, and of Prince Arthur, was established in 1526, immediately with a view to the superintendence of her education, but also with the wider object of governing her &#145;principality&#146; and marches of Wales, and of repressing the chronic disorders of a disturbed district. The council usually sat at Ludlow, where Mary herself most often was, and Denton was one of the few permanent councillors in residence. He frequently also acted on commissions of the peace for the border counties. He retained his position in the Ludlow council until his death, and was also master of the College of St John the Evangelist in Ludlow town. In 1531 he proposed converting the Welsh lordships into English-style shires, a plan which Henry VIII found to be sensible although no action was taken until the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1536 and subsequent related statutes.<br>
<br>Denton's ecclesiastical preferments were numerous. From 1523 to his death he was archdeacon of Cleveland. On 7 January 1522 he became dean of Lichfield. He was a man of great liberality. At Lichfield he &#145;environed the fair old cross with eight fair arches of stone&#146;, and &#145;made a round vault over them for poor people to sit dry&#146;, at an expense of &pound;160  (<span class="italic">Itinerary of John Leland</span>, 2.100). He was also a benefactor of King's College and of St George's Chapel, Windsor. At Lichfield he increased the number of choristers and provided for their maintenance. Between 1517 and 1520 he built, furnished, and endowed a house at Windsor for the chantrists and choristers, situated on the north side of the collegiate church, at a cost of nearly &pound;500. In his will, dated 1 August 1526  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1123, fols. 104&#150;5), he further endowed them with property in Windsor, giving them the reversion of property there, and directing that its issues should be used to finance distributions of bread and clothes to the poor of the town. Denton was also concerned for the preservation of the muniments of King's College, and had them transcribed into at least one large volume, known as the <span class="roman">Liber Denton</span>. Extracts from it survive in the Bodleian Library  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Ashmole 1124, fols. 47&#150;82, and 1125, fols. 90&#150;107). He was also generous to his servants, and especially in providing for the education of their sons. He died at Ludlow on 23 February 1533, and was buried in St Lawrence's Church there.<br>
