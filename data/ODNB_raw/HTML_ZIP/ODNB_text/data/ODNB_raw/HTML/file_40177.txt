<span class="headword">Stephenson, Sir  William Samuel</span>  (1897&#150;1989), <span class="occ">businessman and intelligence officer</span>, was born William Samuel Clouston Stanger on 23 January 1897 in Point Douglas, near Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of William Hunter Stanger, an immigrant from Orkney who worked in a flour mill at Point Douglas, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnston, who was of Icelandic origin  (Macdonald, 26&#150;9). On his father's death in 1901 his mother was left to bring up three infants and he was looked after by a neighbour, Kristin Stephenson, wife of Vigfus Stephenson, a labourer in a lumber yard, whose surname he took. He was educated at Argyle elementary school, Winnipeg. After leaving school he worked in a lumber yard, and then delivered telegrams. In January 1916 he enlisted in the 101st battalion, Winnipeg light infantry (giving his date of birth as 11 January 1896, the date later given in works of reference) and served in France. In 1917 he joined the Royal Flying Corps and underwent pilot training in England before returning to France, where he was shot down in July 1918. He was decorated with the MC and DFC and was officially credited with six air victories.<br>
<br>Between the wars Stephenson was in business in England, his principal interests being the radio transmission of photographs and film production. He married, on 22 July 1924 at Emperor's Gate Presbyterian Church, South Kensington, Mary French (<i>d</i>. 1978), daughter of William H. Simmons, of Springfield, Tennessee. In the 1930s he occasionally provided information obtained on business journeys to Germany to the British intelligence services. In 1940 he went to New York as head of an organization called British Security Co-ordination, intended to promote co-operation with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Originally sent by the SIS (Secret Intelligence Service, MI6), he was responsible also for security (MI5) until March 1942 and for the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Stephenson was energetic and effective. He formed close relationships with the powerful Herbert Hoover, head of the FBI, and with William Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), who acknowledged Stephenson's aid in creating the OSS. In 1945 he was knighted in recognition of his valuable services; from the United States he received the medal for merit, on Donovan's recommendation.<br>
<br>About fifteen years after the end of the war Stephenson began to commission books by various authors to give a more colourful and imaginative slant to his wartime career. The first choice was C. H. Ellis, a former SIS operative; but his draft was not flamboyant enough to satisfy its subject, who gave the task to H. Montgomery Hyde, an established biographer. The result, <span class="italic">The Quiet Canadian</span>, was published in 1962. Its numerous invented stories, based on briefing from Stephenson, created a certain sensation but it still came short of Stephenson's inflated ideas; and as fresh revelations of British successes in the intelligence sphere continued to appear&#151;for instance the Ultra secret&#151;he clearly wished to claim credit for them. He accordingly commissioned another biographer, William Stevenson (no relation of his), and provided him with careful guidance, a fund of fresh stories, and misleading and wrongly captioned photographs. The publication of Stevenson's book, <span class="italic">A Man Called Intrepid</span>, in 1976, brought enormous publicity and record sales, especially in North America. It is almost entirely a work of fiction.<br>
<br>Stephenson's First World War record was embellished with twenty extra air victories, the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, the Croix de Guerre with palms (in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry from 1984 onwards he added two bars to his DFC), and also the amateur lightweight boxing championship of the world. About the Second World War Stephenson's fantasy was unrestrained. The principal claim is that he was so close to Winston Churchill that he was appointed his &#145;personal representative in the western hemisphere&#146;. In truth there is no evidence that he ever met Churchill and much evidence to the contrary. In 1976 he quoted in support a letter attributed to Churchill, which was immediately denounced as a fabrication; in a biographical note of 1982 he withdrew this claim and substituted another story that can also be proved fictitious. Stevenson's book used as a frontispiece a well-known press photograph of Churchill and Brendan Bracken; in the caption, supplied by his mentor, Bracken's name is changed to Stephenson.<br>
<br>The principal purpose of <span class="italic">A Man Called Intrepid</span> is to enumerate the best-known successes of British wartime skill and intelligence and ascribe them to Stephenson: the decipherment of German &#145;Enigma&#146; transmissions, the development of nuclear weapons, and the organization of European resistance. Stephenson was supposedly involved in them all and found time also to invent petroleum warfare and the V sign, and to help with the production of the Spitfire and the jet engine. He is described as an invisible man directing the work of all four intelligence agencies: SIS, SOE, security executive, and MI5; invisible is the <i>mot juste</i>. Film clips misrepresented as genuine archival material were used to suggest a wholly imaginary connection between Stephenson and the famous SOE agent Madeleine. The book, later made into a successful film, was strongly criticized by knowledgeable reviewers in Britain who called it &#145;worthless&#146;, &#145;ludicrous&#146;, and &#145;dishonest&#146;; this did not affect Stephenson's reputation in North America.<br>
<br>Stephenson was short in stature and often called Little Bill. He spent the last years of his life in Bermuda. In 1980 he was appointed a companion of the order of Canada. After his wife's death he adopted as his daughter the person who had nursed her during her final illness. He died in Bermuda on 31 January 1989 and was buried there.<br>
