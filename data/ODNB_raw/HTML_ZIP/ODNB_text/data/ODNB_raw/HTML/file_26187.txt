</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spurgeon,  Charles Haddon</span>  (1834&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Baptist preacher and religious writer</span>, was born on 19 June 1834 at Kelvedon, Essex, the eldest of seventeen children, eight surviving, of John Spurgeon (1810&#150;1902), clerk to a coal and shipping firm and lay preacher, later an Independent minister, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jarvis (1815&#150;1888).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears18351851"></a>Early years, 1835&#150;1851</h2>From late 1835 until 1841 Spurgeon lived with his grandparents James (1776&#150;1864) and Sarah Spurgeon and his aunt Ann at Stambourne, Essex. Later, he often spent school holidays there. His grandfather, minister of Stambourne Independent Chapel from 1810 to 1864, influenced him greatly, as did his aunt. The young Spurgeon, his brother James recalled, always had his head in a book, typically works by Bunyan, Foxe, and other puritan divines, and heard with pride of puritan ancestors persecuted for their faith. Other childhood influences included Richard Knill, a missionary visitor who in 1844 predicted Spurgeon's preaching greatness, and his mother, who urged her children to repent and seek salvation. Old for his years, Spurgeon attended a village school in Stambourne, run by Mrs Burleigh. On rejoining his family, now in Colchester, he went to a school run by a Mrs Cook, then from 1844 to Henry Lewis's Stockwell House School, where he won a prize for English. In 1848 he went to the Anglican College Agricultural School in Maidstone, where an uncle, David Walker, was master. The following year he became an articled pupil at John Swindell's school in Newmarket, studying French and Greek. His brother, James, recalled that they enjoyed &#145;the best education that nonconformity could command&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Sword &amp; the Trowel</span>, June 1892, 301).<br>
<br>Spurgeon had shown religious leanings from an early age. In 1849 he gave a missionary address and began work on a fiercely anti-Catholic essay: <span class="italic">Anti-Christ and her Brood, or, Popery Unmasked</span>. He dated his conversion quite precisely, however, to a direct appeal from a Primitive Methodist preacher in Colchester on 6 January 1850. He had meant to worship elsewhere, but changed course to shelter from a snowstorm. The joy and power of his conversion&#151;his overwhelming sense that day of God's forgiveness and love&#151;ended years of agonizing about his sinful state and shaped his future ministry, with its emphasis on personal experience. Within weeks he began distributing tracts, and in April he joined the Congregational church at Newmarket. He had, though, been persuaded while at Maidstone of the need for believer's baptism, and on 3 May was baptized in the River Lark at Isleham Ferry by the Revd William Cantlow, minister of Pound Lane Baptist Church, Isleham.<br>
<br>Back in Newmarket, Spurgeon became a Sunday school teacher. In August 1850 he moved to Cambridge, helping at the school opened by Edwin Leeding, a former usher at Stockwell House, in return for some tuition. That October he joined St Andrew's Street Baptist Church, and was soon giving Sunday school addresses. He was tricked into preaching his first sermon, at Teversham, in January 1851, being under the impression that a companion had been assigned the task. Afterwards he began preaching regularly and to marked effect for the church lay preachers' association.<h2>
<a name="FirststepsasapreachertheMetropolitanTabernacleandpublications"></a>First steps as a preacher, the Metropolitan Tabernacle, and publications</h2>In October 1851 Spurgeon agreed to preach at Waterbeach for a few Sundays. He continued for over two years, remaining at Leeding's school for much of that time but abandoning plans to open his own school. The Waterbeach congregation flourished, and three mission stations were opened. Much encouraged, Spurgeon began to build up what was to become a huge library and read avidly, but resisted pressure (including that from his father) to train for the ministry at college.<br>
<br>Spurgeon's reputation spread, and in December 1853, to his surprise, he was asked to preach at New Park Street, Southwark, a historic church with dwindling congregations. His first sermons there, on 18 December, made a great impression, and the church asked him back for three more Sundays, then for six months, then permanently. Hesitant initially, the nineteen-year-old Spurgeon accepted the invitation on 28 April 1854. Rejecting ordination as needless ceremonial, he was welcomed at a tea for members. His early converts included Susannah Thompson (1832&#150;1903), only daughter of a prosperous ribbon manufacturer, whom he married on 8 January 1856. Susannah was closely involved in Spurgeon's work, despite long spells of ill health from 1868. The couple had twin sons, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1926) and Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1917), born in September 1856 at their home in the New Kent Road. After early commercial careers, both sons entered the Baptist ministry and became closely associated with their father's work.<br>
<br>Spurgeon soon achieved celebrity status. Unprepossessing in appearance&#151;short, stocky, and clumsy, with an over-large head and coarse features&#151;he was dismissed by many as a nine-day wonder; received coolly by fellow London ministers, he was caricatured and condemned for vulgarity, sensationalism, and irreverence. In spite of, or perhaps because of, his critics, crowds flocked, drawn by his youth and dramatic manner, by his plain speaking, humour, and vivid illustrations, by the force of his conviction, and by his power over his congregation. In the heightened atmosphere induced by cholera and the Crimean War, Spurgeon's message of man's sinful state and the wrath to come touched a raw nerve, and he had a talent for making hearers feel that his message was directed at them personally. London, it was said, had seen nothing like it since George Whitefield  (<span class="italic">Pen and Ink Portrait</span>).<br>
<br>In February 1855, with New Park Street overflowing, Spurgeon took the unusual step of leasing the Exeter Hall on the Strand, celebrated as the scene of the annual May meetings of religious societies, for regular worship. When his enlarged chapel was still too small, he again took Exeter Hall, moving to the new, and even larger, Surrey Gardens Music Hall in October 1856 then back to Exeter Hall in December 1859. The first night at an over-packed Surrey Gardens ended in catastrophe, when a false fire alarm caused a stampede in which seven died and twenty-eight were badly injured. Some press reports blamed Spurgeon for the disaster, and the incident traumatized him, leaving lasting scars. For a short time it seemed that he might never preach again. When he did return to Surrey Gardens (for more manageable morning services) congregations were even larger. His hearers included Ruskin&#151;whom he entertained at home in Clapham&#151;Lord John Russell, Lord Chief Justice Lord Campbell, and Sir Richard Mayne, chief commissioner of police. Finally, in March 1861, Spurgeon moved to the purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at London's Elephant and Castle. Described as the largest building in England for public worship, with space for between 5000 and 6000, the tabernacle cost &pound;31,000, a third of which Spurgeon raised himself, and was opened debt-free&#151;a testament to his belief in the divine provision of finance. It became a place of pilgrimage, one of London's sights. Spurgeon ministered there until his death, filling the building consistently. Dressed from the 1860s in conservative business suits, his preaching appealed especially to the lower-middle and respectable working classes, but admirers included Gladstone, Lord Shaftesbury, and US President James Garfield.<br>
<br>Elsewhere, Spurgeon drew record-breaking crowds. In September 1855 he preached on heaven and hell to 12,000 people in a field in Hackney; and nearly 24,000 heard his address at the Crystal Palace in October 1857, on the day of national humiliation following the Indian mutiny. This record-breaking crowd tested to the full his amazing powers of voice projection. Spurgeon's sermon from the Epsom racecourse grandstand in June 1858 on the text &#145;So run that ye may obtain&#146; showed a publicist's instinct for eye-catching venues and texts. Concerned about crowd safety, he stopped open-air preaching in London, but continued it on frequent midweek tours around the country. Among continental tours in the early 1860s, his 1860 Paris trip was particularly successful, resulting in a special pamphlet. Back in London in 1867, great services in the Agricultural Hall, Islington, boosted his influence in the city.<br>
<br>Spurgeon reached a still wider audience through his published sermons, including over 3500 weekly penny sermons published from 1855 until 1917, first as the <span class="italic">New Park Street Pulpit</span>, then as the <span class="italic">Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit</span>. The sermons, delivered extempore, were taken down in shorthand and revised by Spurgeon every Monday, and quickly reached an average circulation of 25,000&#150;30,000. They were sold on railway bookstalls, telegraphed to America (where until he condemned slavery Spurgeon had a very strong following), inserted as advertisements in Australian weeklies, sent to heads of government, and translated into nearly forty languages from Arabic to Urdu, selling in all over 100 million copies. Sermons noted especially for their converting power include: &#145;Looking unto Jesus&#146; (no. 195), &#145;Compel them to come in&#146; (no. 227), and &#145;The shameful sufferer&#146; (no. 236), all preached at the Surrey Gardens Music Hall; &#145;There go the ships&#146; (no. 1259); and &#145;Supposing him to be the gardener&#146; (no. 1699). Among other notable sermons, a highly controversial 1864 address on baptismal regeneration sold nearly 250,000 copies and generated heated pamphlet exchanges. In a move seen by some as unduly provocative and divisive, Spurgeon accused evangelical clergymen of hypocrisy and self-interest for publicly denying that baptism brought salvation, yet subscribing to a prayer book which contained this doctrine. The bitter aftermath of this controversy led to Spurgeon withdrawing for a time from the Evangelical Alliance.<br>
<br>The weekly penny and other sermon volumes make up around half of Spurgeon's 150 or so publications, excluding the many compilations of sermon extracts, notes, and outlines seized on by countless local preachers. Many of his works are still in print. The most popular included <span class="italic">John Ploughman's Talk</span> (1868), a collection of wise sayings, which sold 350,000 copies in twenty years, and <span class="italic">John Ploughman's Pictures</span> (1881). A good deal of his writing was devotional, designed for use in daily meditations or family worship, or by enquirers or doubters. Examples include <span class="italic">The Saint and the Saviour</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Interpreter</span> (n.d. [1874]), and <span class="italic">The Cheque Book of the Bank of Faith</span> (1888), a compilation of <span class="roman">Bible</span> promises arranged for daily use. Other notable publications include: <span class="italic">Commenting and Commentaries</span> (1876), a frank catalogue of commentaries &#145;compiled for the use of ministers of average attainments&#146;, and the seven-volume <span class="italic">Treasury of David</span> (1870&#150;86), an expository and devotional commentary on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. Spurgeon also wrote many tracts and pamphlets, produced a yearly <span class="italic">Almanack</span>, and (though he was not particularly musical) wrote hymns and compiled <span class="italic">Our Own Hymn Book</span> (1870). He contributed regularly to the <span class="italic">Baptist Messenger</span> and briefly (in 1861&#150;2) co-edited the <span class="italic">Baptist Magazine</span>. In 1865 he launched his own monthly, <span class="italic">The Sword and the Trowel</span>, and wrote much of this himself.<h2>
<a name="Evangelismandtheology"></a>Evangelism and theology</h2>Spurgeon was, though, more than a &#145;monster preacher&#146; and prolific author. Many of his hearers joined the church, boosting membership from 313 in 1854 to over 5400 in the early 1880s. In the early to mid-1870s, when the church grew at its fastest, over 500 members joined each year. At the tabernacle, the Revd Charles Spurgeon, later plain Mr Spurgeon, and later still, reluctantly, Pastor Charles Spurgeon or (to church workers closest to him) &#145;the governor&#146; commanded intense personal loyalty. He also headed a host of evangelistic and philanthropic organizations. One of the earliest and dearest to him&#151;and a personal venture initially&#151;was Pastors' College, started in 1856 to train promising preachers irrespective of background, funds, or education, and with a stress on winning souls rather than &#145;lofty scholarship&#146;. By 1892 nearly 900 students, roughly one in five Baptist ministers, had passed through the college, by then housed in purpose-built premises behind the tabernacle. Many were drawn from the tabernacle congregation. Spurgeon's entertaining Friday afternoon lectures to students, many later published, often on practicalities such as posture or gestures, were a highlight of the week. The college also ran evening classes for young working men &#145;who desire to improve their talents that they may employ them in the service of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Sword &amp; the Trowel</span>, Aug 1878, 417), and pioneered Friday night popular lectures. An annual college conference, later renamed the Pastors' College Evangelical Association, helped maintain close bonds with former students. A Society of Evangelists (formed 1877&#150;8) supported itinerant evangelists. From 1888 a Missionary Association helped students serving abroad.<br>
<br>At the tabernacle itself an Evangelists' Association (founded in 1862) supplied lay preachers to mission stations and lodging houses and was a proving ground for many entrants to the college. The Colportage Association (1866) was by 1891 supporting nearly 100 full-time agents from Yorkshire to the Isle of Wight in evangelizing and selling religious and healthy literature door to door. The non-sectarian Stockwell orphanage (1867) catered for 240 boys in a series of separate houses, with a girls' wing added in 1879. Almshouses (1868) replaced and extended an earlier foundation and incorporated a day school for nearly 400 children. Mrs Spurgeon's Book Fund (1875), coupled later with a Pastors' Aid Fund, was by 1887 distributing over 10,000 books and 21,000 sermons a year to needy clergymen and ministers. The Country Mission, &#145;an evangelistic effort for the suburbs and the country&#146;, and a loan fund for erecting new places of worship, together with mothers' meetings, tract societies, temperance societies, and many other benevolent and missionary organizations completed the picture. When the church celebrated Spurgeon's fiftieth birthday in 1884, thirty-one societies, nine <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, and twenty-six missions, schools, or missions and schools were represented. The college, orphanage, and Colportage Association alone cost almost &pound;12,500 a year to run. Raising funds and acknowledging donations took up much of Spurgeon's time. Comfortably off as time went on, he gave generously to the various causes himself. Presented with a testimonial of nearly &pound;6500 to mark his London silver jubilee in 1879, Spurgeon used most of it to secure the future of the almshouses.<br>
<br>Spurgeon played a leading role in forming the London Baptist Association in 1865, of which he served as president in 1869, and sat on its committee until 1888. He also sat on the Baptist Missionary Society committee, having previously pressed for a tightening of its rules of membership to include a profession of Christian belief. This was part of a wider attempt to strengthen the society's links with the churches and promote the faith mission principle. An ardent admirer of George Muller, the orphanage founder who trusted God to meet his needs, Spurgeon was convinced that society should put its faith in God, rather than subscribers. A committed Liberal until the home-rule split of 1886, after which he supported the unionist cause, he spoke out occasionally on public matters and at elections, and until his resignation in 1891 could be found on Liberation Society platforms. He was not, though, a natural committee man (he declined to join the Baptist Union committee in 1862) and he had little time for public platforms. His workload of between eight and ten sermons a week, editing, church work, and college oversight and correspondence was lightened by the appointment of &#145;teachers&#146; at the tabernacle from 1862, and further in 1868 when his only brother, James, became co-pastor. At home at Helensburgh House in Clapham, and later amid 9 acres at Westwood, Upper Norwood, he found relaxation in the garden over bowls, quoits, or a cigar. Plagued by kidney trouble from a young age, however, he struggled increasingly with chronic rheumatic gout from the late 1860s. One commentator  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Haddon Spurgeon</span>, 166) has estimated that he spent around a third of his last twenty-two years either ill, or recovering from or taking precautions against illness. The precautions included annual winter visits to the French riviera, most often to Menton.<br>
<br>Spurgeon cared little for theological systems. He was, for example, unconcerned that the Calvinist doctrine of predestination sat uncomfortably with zeal to convert sinners. For him, what mattered was the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, unerring and divinely inspired, and its message that, in Christ, God had paid the price for man's depravity. Deeply suspicious of biblical criticism, Spurgeon's fear that faith was being undermined led him to back opponents of T. T. Lynch's new hymnal in the rivulet controversy of 1856. He joined protests in 1860 at Baldwin Brown's <span class="italic">Divine Life of Man</span>, rejoiced in 1877 when Congregationalists held firm to their union's declaration of faith and order, and from the early 1880s became increasingly distant from the Baptist Union. His growing disenchantment with theological trends culminated in the down-grade controversy, which rocked the Baptist Union and sent shock waves through wider nonconformity in the autumn of 1887. In a series of colourfully worded articles in <span class="italic">The Sword and the Trowel</span>, Spurgeon alleged that unnamed Baptist ministers had abandoned, or down-graded, evangelical truths for a new religion &#145;which is no more Christianity than chalk is cheese&#146;. Surprised and disappointed by the Baptist Union's failure to respond to his allegations, Spurgeon withdrew from it in October 1887, later resigning from the London Baptist Association also. Subsequent negotiations failed to persuade him to return. Spurgeon refused to substantiate his charges. The union held out against his insistence that members should in future be bound by a doctrinal declaration. For a time there were fears that the controversy might split the union. In the event, only a handful of ministers and churches closest to Spurgeon left the union with him. Thereafter, Spurgeon cut a lonely figure, saddened by a sense that friends and former students had betrayed him and by his belief that English Christianity was departing from the true faith. Easily despondent, he sat, said one reviewer, &#145;like the giant pope in Pilgrim's Progress, at the mouth of the cave, gnashing his teeth against those not of his way of thinking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>, 5/26, Feb 1892).<h2>
<a name="Illnessanddeath"></a>Illness and death</h2>Spurgeon continued to write and preach. On 26 April 1891, however, a nervous attack left him speechless in the pulpit, and, though he later recovered, his sermon on 7 June 1891 was his last at the Metropolitan Tabernacle. After three months' serious illness, diagnosed initially as severe influenza, Spurgeon recovered sufficiently to travel, first to Eastbourne, then to Menton for the winter, but his health again relapsed. He died on 31 January 1892 at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Menton, of uraemic poisoning (Bright's disease) aggravated by gout. He was fifty-seven. After a memorial service at the Scotch Presbyterian Church in Menton, his embalmed body was brought back to England for a succession of packed memorial services and burial in Norwood cemetery on 11 February. (He had hoped to be buried in the orphanage, but this proved impracticable.) Archibald G. Brown, minister at the East London Tabernacle, and his most distinguished student, gave the graveside eulogy.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandinfluence"></a>Reputation and influence</h2>Spurgeon had his critics. George Eliot, noted <span class="italic">The Times</span>, thought him &#145;utterly common and empty of guiding intellect or emotion&#146;, responsible for &#145;the most superficial grocer's back parlour view of Calvinist Christianity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Feb 1892). Others accused him of undervaluing academic scholarship (notably by ignoring the several university degrees conferred on him), of lacking awe, of a narrow theology and limited horizons, of seeing things only in black and white. &#145;With Mr Spurgeon you were either up or down, in or out, alive or dead&#146;  (Parker, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Feb 1892). Spurgeon's reluctance to accept that there could be more than one side to an argument left him weak as a debater or tactician. He failed to halt the rise of liberal theology. Uncertainty about who was to succeed him, coupled with his strong personal following, also made for problems at the tabernacle following his death.<br>
<br>For all that, Spurgeon had a huge and lasting influence. In addition to his record-breaking preaching and congregation, and the worldwide audience for his sermons, the training offered at the Pastors' College, where he was revered, helped to change the face of Baptist ministry, encouraging recruits from working-class backgrounds and shaping the style and theology of men such as Archibald Brown and of William Cuff at Shoreditch. Across London and beyond Baptists grew in strength, benefiting enormously from Spurgeon's reputation, the work of his students, evangelists, and deacons, the transfer of tabernacle members, financial help from the tabernacle's Loan Building Fund, and the London Baptist Association's support for new church-building. In 1892 over 200 new churches in London and the home counties alone owed their rise at least in part to Spurgeon. They, and other Spurgeon followers, helped greatly to bolster support for conservative evangelical theology.<br>
<br>Spurgeon's example encouraged others to advertise sermons and use public buildings for public worship. His Grecian-style tabernacle was much copied. While not alone, he was a leading exponent of a more natural, direct preaching style. The extent of his influence was shown by the 10,000 messages, letters of condolence, resolutions, and telegrams sent to his homes during his last illness; by the daily bulletins on his state of health, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and posted up in public places; by the thousands attending memorial services around the country; and by the estimated 60,000 people who queued to view his coffin.<br>
