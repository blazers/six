<span class="headword">Gower,  Millicent Fanny  Sutherland-Leveson-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Millicent Fanny  St Clair-Erskine]</span>, duchess of Sutherland  (1867&#150;1955), <span class="occ">society hostess and social reformer</span>, was born on 20 October 1867 at Dysart House, Fife, the eldest child of Robert St Clair-Erskine, fourth earl of Rosslyn (1833&#150;1900), and his wife, Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of Henry Fitzroy and widow of the Hon. Charles Maynard. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33567/', "Frances Evelyn (Daisy) Greville, countess of Warwick")</script>, was her half-sister. On her seventeenth birthday she married Cromartie Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, marquess of Stafford (1851&#150;1913), and rapidly established herself as one of the most successful London hostesses, one of the few who was at home with both the Marlborough House set and the Souls. Her first book, <span class="italic">How I Spent my Twentieth Year</span>, was published in 1889. Two sons and two daughters were born between 1885 and 1893; the eldest child, a daughter, died at the age of two and a half. In 1892 her husband succeeded to the title of fourth duke of Sutherland, and to extensive estates in Scotland, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. Their London residence, Stafford House, became (as it had been under Sutherland's grandmother, the Duchess Harriet) a great venue for social and political receptions. Millicent's fame as a society beauty was captured about 1904 in John Singer Sargent's portrait of her.<br>
<br>But Millicent Sutherland was not content to be merely a society hostess. She had a serious outlook on life and became active as a social reformer, earning the nicknames the Democratic Duchess and Meddlesome Millie; she did not travel as far down the road to socialism as her half-sister, Daisy Warwick. She campaigned successfully for the elimination of the use of lead in pottery glazing in the Staffordshire potteries, for which she was caricatured by Arnold Bennett in his <span class="roman">Five Towns</span> novels as the Countess of Chell. She contributed a chapter, &#145;On the dangerous processes in the potting industry&#146;, to a local study of workers in pottery manufacture. She also founded the North Staffordshire Cripples' Aid Society, attempted to revive the home-spun woollen industry in the Scottish highlands, and helped to found a rural technical school at Golspie in Sutherland. She served as president of the Scottish Home Industries Association. The duchess also had ambitions to be a writer. Her first novel, <span class="italic">One Hour and the Next</span> (1899), reflected her growing political awareness and surging romanticism; a volume of short stories, <span class="italic">The Winds of the World</span> (1902), was scathingly reviewed but was avidly read by a less critical public. She commissioned and edited a volume of poetry by leading poets of the day and wrote a play in blank verse, <span class="italic">The Conqueror</span>, which received a dozen performances at the Scala Theatre in London in 1905. In 1924 a semi-autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">That Fool of a Woman</span>, was to appear, revealing much about her marital misadventures.<br>
<br>The duke died in 1913, and on 17 October 1914 Millicent married Percy Desmond Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1933), an army officer. On the outbreak of the First World War she organized a Red Cross ambulance unit, and served in France throughout the war. She was captured at Namur in the German advance in 1914, but managed to escape. She became director of No. 9 British Red Cross Hospital at Calais, and moved with it to Roubaix in June 1918, where it became a front-line casualty clearing station. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the Belgian Royal Red Cross, and the British Red Cross medal.<br>
<br>The duchess divorced Fitzgerald, a philanderer, in 1919. Her third marriage, to Colonel George Ernest Hawes (<i>d</i>. 1945), on 27 October 1919, was equally unfortunate: he was a homosexual, and she divorced him in 1925. Thereafter she drifted from one house to another in France, and travelled extensively. In 1940 she was living near Angers, and when the French capitulated she found herself once more to be a prisoner in German hands. She escaped, through Spain and Portugal, to the United States, and was one of the first foreign civilians to return to liberated Paris in 1945. To a friend, Princess Marthe Bibesco, she confessed that she now felt she had lost all her usefulness. She died on 20 August 1955 at La Maizou, Orriule, near Sauveterre-de-B&eacute;arn, Basses Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, France, and was cremated at the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. Her ashes were returned to the Sutherland private cemetery at Dunrobin. Her younger son and daughter had predeceased her.<br>
