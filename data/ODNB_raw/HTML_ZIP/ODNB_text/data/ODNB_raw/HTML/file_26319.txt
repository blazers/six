<span class="headword">Starkie,  Thomas</span>  (1782&#150;1849), <span class="occ">barrister and jurist</span>, eldest son of the Revd Thomas Starkie, vicar of Blackburn, Lancashire, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Thomas Yatman, was born at Blackburn vicarage on 12 April 1782. He was educated at Clitheroe grammar school and St John's College, Cambridge, where he was entered as a pensioner on 2 January 1799. He was senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman in 1803, in which year he graduated BA; he proceeded MA in 1806. He was elected to a fellowship of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, in 1803, which he relinquished on his marriage in 1812 to Lucy, eldest daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29226/', "Revd Thomas Dunham Whitaker")</script>, vicar of Whalley, Lancashire.<br>
<br>After being a pupil in the chambers of Joseph Chitty the elder (1775&#150;1841), Starkie was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 23 May 1810, and immediately joined the northern circuit. He also practised as a special pleader as well as in the common-law courts, and was KC at Lancaster before obtaining the rank of QC at Westminster Hall. In 1823 he was elected Downing professor of law at Cambridge. Although allowing students to attend his lectures without paying a fee, he generally attracted very small numbers, and he abandoned giving lectures within a couple of years of his appointment. In 1833 he gave lectures at the Inner Temple, but although his learning and range were great, he was not regarded as a good lecturer, even in comparison with his contemporary John Austin, and both sets of lectures were sparsely attended.<br>
<br>In 1833 Starkie was appointed as a member of the royal commission set up by Lord Henry Brougham to codify the criminal law, which produced eight reports between 1834 and 1845. He also sat on the subsequent royal commission for revising and consolidating the criminal law, which produced five reports, the last appearing in 1849, after his death. Starkie played a leading role on these commissions, although disagreeing with his fellow commissioners over some points of principle. One of his colleagues, Bellenden Ker, complained to Brougham of Starkie's &#145;childish&#146; moods and his &#145;desultory and wayward&#146; habits, and the way he muddled his papers &#145;into a crumpled heap in his breaches pocket&#146;  (Brougham MSS). Starkie was also for some time a law reporter, and the author of <span class="italic">Practical Treatise on the Law of Slander, Libel, and Incidentally of Malicious Prosecutions</span>, first published in 1812. This was the most important work of its time on its subject, and was praised for its strong grasp of general principles and great power of arrangement. He also published <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence</span> in 1824, which became a standard work in its field.<br>
<br>Starkie was originally a tory in politics, and strenuously opposed the <span class="roman">Roman Catholic Emancipation Bill</span>. However, his politics later changed, and in 1840 he stood as a Liberal candidate for the borough of Cambridge, but lost the election to his Conservative opponent, Sir Alexander Grant. In 1847 he became judge of the Clerkenwell small-debts court, which had jurisdiction over the greater part of Middlesex. He died in his rooms in Downing College, Cambridge, on 15 April 1849. He had five children, of whom two daughters survived him.<br>
