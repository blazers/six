<span class="headword">Wheeler,  James Talboys</span>  (1824&#150;1897), <span class="occ">historian of India</span>, son of James Luff Wheeler, bookseller (<i>d</i>. 1862), and his wife, Anne Ophelia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26947/', "David Alphonso Talboys")</script>, was born at Oxford on 22 December 1824. Educated at a private school, he was unsuccessful as a publisher and bookseller but gained some credit as a writer of handbooks for university students and of a more elaborate work on the geography of Herodotus (1848). During the Crimean War he was appointed to a supernumerary clerkship at the War Office. He married, on 15 January 1852 in Cambridge, Emily, daughter of Robert Roe, printseller; they had three surviving sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1858 Wheeler went to India as editor of the <span class="italic">Madras Spectator</span>, but abandoned journalism on being appointed professor of moral and mental philosophy in the Madras Presidency College in 1858. In May 1860 he was employed by the Madras government to examine its records; the results of his research appeared as <span class="italic">Madras in the Olden Time</span> (1861). On 26 February 1862 he was appointed assistant secretary to the government of India in the foreign department, and moved to Calcutta, where, among other duties, he had charge of the foreign and, later, of the home offices when the secretaries were at Simla. In Calcutta he compiled under orders of government a series of background memoranda on the history and political relations of a number of countries bordering on India. Early in 1870 he was transferred to Rangoon as secretary to the chief commissioner of British Burma. In November 1870 he visited Mandalay and Bhamo in that capacity, and had an interview with the king of Burma.<br>
<br>In 1873 Wheeler obtained a long leave of absence in England, where he continued his work on an extended <span class="italic">History of India</span>, the first volume of which had been published in 1867; the last of its four volumes appeared in 1881. After returning to India in 1876, he was employed to report on the records in the home and foreign departments at Calcutta; he compiled two volumes, which he was allowed to publish. He also prepared and published an official <span class="italic">History of the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi</span> (1877). He retired from the service and lived at Witham, Essex, and then Fulham, London, where in 1884 he was the subject of bankruptcy proceedings brought by his creditors. He died at Ramsgate on 13 January 1897. Wheeler was one of the first historians of British India to rely primarily on documentary sources. Although his perspectives were unequivocally imperialist, his work continues to be consulted for its empirical strengths.<br>
