</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coke,  Thomas</span>  (1747&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of Methodist missions</span>, was born at Brecon on 28 September 1747, the third but only surviving son of Bartholomew Coke (1701/2&#150;1773) and Ann(e) Phillips (1712/13&#150;1783), and was baptized on 5 October at St Mary's Church, Brecon. His father, the eldest son of Edward Cooke of Llanfrynach (<i>d</i>. 1730), prospered as an apothecary in Brecon, where he became a common councillor and alderman and was twice elected bailiff (or mayor), dying on 7 May 1773, aged seventy-one. His mother, the daughter of Thomas Phillips of Trostre, Cantref, a neighbouring parish of Llanfrynach, died on 17 May 1783, aged seventy. Following in his father's footsteps, Thomas was elected to the common council on 24 September 1769 and a year later became bailiff. He continued his association with the council <i>in absentia</i> at least until 1798.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyministry"></a>Education and early ministry</h2>Thomas was educated at Christ College, Brecon (where he was a contemporary of Walter Churchey), and at Jesus College, Oxford, where he was enrolled as a gentleman commoner on 6 April 1764. He graduated BA in 1768 and MA in 1770, and in 1775 obtained his DCL with the support of the prime minister, Lord North. Meanwhile, he had been ordained deacon on Trinity Sunday 1770 and priest on 23 August 1772. No remaining evidence of a supposed curacy at Rode, Somerset, has been traced; but by 14 July 1771 he had taken up his duties as curate to the Revd Robert Twyford, vicar of South Petherton, and from the spring of 1773 seems to have been largely in charge of the parish, perhaps because of Twyford's ill health. Despite showing marked high-church tendencies at first, he came increasingly under Methodist influence, chiefly through reading the works of John Wesley and John Fletcher, and on 13 August 1776 rode over to Kingston St Mary, north of Taunton, to meet Wesley. They talked at length and Coke appears to have been ready to leave his post to serve in Wesley's &#145;world parish&#146;. But Wesley sent him back to South Petherton, advising him to do &#145;all the good he could, visiting from house to house, omitting no part of his clerical duty&#146; and to avoid &#145;every reasonable ground of offence&#146;  (Moore, 2.9). Within a few months, however, Coke's Methodist &#145;enthusiasm&#146;, which included open-air preaching and cottage meetings, brought local opposition to a head, and a change of incumbent provided the opportunity his opponents sought to drive him from his curacy at Easter 1777. &#145;Dr Coke&#146;, wrote Wesley on 19 August 1777, &#145;has bid adieu to his honourable name and determined to cast in his lot with us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 6.169).<h2>
<a name="Wesleysrighthandman"></a>Wesley's right-hand man</h2>From this point on Coke was closely associated with the Methodist movement and quickly became a leading figure, enjoying the confidence of the ageing Wesley and entrusted by him with a variety of tasks and responsibilities. In London he acted as Wesley's amanuensis. As Wesley wrote to Mary Fletcher in 1782:<blockquote>It seems to have been the will of God for many years that I should have none to share <i>my proper labour</i>. My brother never did. Thomas Walsh began to do it; so did John Jones. But one died and one fainted. Dr. Coke promises fair; at present I have none like minded. (J. Wesley to M. Fletcher, 12 July 1782, <span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 7.128)</blockquote>Coke also found himself travelling more and more extensively through the British Isles as Wesley's representative and trouble-shooter. In 1782 he presided for the first time in place of Wesley over the Irish conference. His education and social background singled him out among the Methodist itinerants and was one cause of the misgivings and suspicions that surfaced from time to time. Charles Wesley was particularly unhappy, suspecting Coke of usurping his place in his brother's affections and confidence and of wielding too much influence on him. But Coke's usefulness was demonstrated in a variety of ways and situations, from the disputes that broke out in Birstall and Dewsbury over the legal settlement of the preaching-houses to the drafting of the <span class="roman">Deed of Declaration</span>, which gave official status to the conference as heir to Wesley's authority after his death. (Wesley, however, firmly denied that Coke had any say in the choice of preachers named as the legal hundred.)<h2>
<a name="InAmerica"></a>In America</h2>These administrative and diplomatic roles, which earned Coke more criticism than approval, were no more than a prelude to the major tasks which later occupied his time and energies and for which he has chiefly been remembered. The year 1784 in which the deed was drafted proved to be a watershed in his life. His involvement from then on in the establishment of an American Methodist church independent of Wesley and the British conference, and also of the first Methodist overseas missions, placed him at the centre of developments in Methodism on both sides of the Atlantic in the two decades after Wesley's death in 1791. There had been Methodists in the American colonies since the 1760s and Wesley had sent over several of his itinerant preachers, notably Francis Asbury, to foster the work there. The War of American Independence had left the colonial Methodists &#145;as sheep without a shepherd&#146; and bereft of the sacraments, since many of the Anglican clergy and the British itinerants had left the colonies. Legal and constitutional difficulties delayed any effective action by the bishop of London; and in August 1784 Wesley responded to repeated pleas for help from his American followers by ordaining two of his preachers and dispatching them to the newly independent United States. At the same time Coke was &#145;set apart&#146; as superintendent of the American work. Presiding over the hastily convened Christmas conference in Baltimore, he in turn &#145;ordained&#146; Asbury as deacon, elder, and fellow superintendent (a title soon changed to the more scriptural but controversial bishop) and an autonomous Methodist Episcopal church was formed, despite a last-minute attempt by two local clergymen to avert a formal separation.<br>
<br>Coke's role in this sequence of events has been much debated and the evidence is inconclusive at several points. Charles Wesley, when news of the ordinations belatedly reached him, was horrified, and in a series of sarcastic verses had no hesitation in blaming Coke for leading his ageing brother into such serious irregularities, identifying self-aggrandizement as his motive:<blockquote>
<div>So easily are Bishops made<br>
</div>
<div>By man's or woman's whim?<br>
</div>
<div>W--- his hands on C--- hath laid,<br>
</div>
<div>But who laid hands on him?<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>Hands on himself he laid, and took<br>
</div>
<div>An Apostolic Chair;<br>
</div>
<div>And then ordain'd his creature C---<br>
</div>
<div>His Heir and Successor.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Representative Verse of Charles Wesley</span>, 367&#150;8)</blockquote>The questions remain: did the idea of his giving authority to Coke by setting him apart originate from Wesley himself or from the younger man? Was Coke responsible for encouraging the American Methodists to go further in the direction of independence from the Church of England (and the British Methodists) than Wesley ever intended? In particular, was he motivated by an unalloyed desire to serve the evangelical cause or by the self-seeking ambition of which his detractors accused him; or was it, more plausibly, a case of mixed (and at least partially unconscious) motives? On these matters the jury is still out, but it can at least be said that neither his contemporary critics nor subsequent scholarship have in general been willing to give him the benefit of any doubt.<br>
<br>Coke's visit to the United States in 1784&#150;5 was the first of nine in the next twenty years. In spite of his growing commitments at home and the upheaval in the British connexion caused by Wesley's death in 1791, he continued to fulfil his episcopal responsibilities as fully as the American Methodists' allegiance to Asbury and Asbury's own reluctance to share his authority permitted. In particular, although Cokesbury College, the educational venture which he initiated in spite of Asbury's misgivings, proved abortive, it set a precedent which American Methodism was to follow in later years. But the fact that he remained a British citizen, though sympathetic to the American cause, coupled with his frequent absences, restricted Coke's influence and usefulness there. Eventually it was his marriage in 1805 that brought his trans-Atlantic commuting to an end; and though he made one last offer to settle in America, his usefulness had passed its zenith and his offer was not taken up.<br>
<br>Coke was in America when news of Wesley's death reached him and he hurried back to England in time for the conference, no doubt expecting to step into Wesley's shoes. But this was not to be. Wesley's benevolent autocracy had left the itinerant preachers in no doubt that they would have &#145;no king in Israel&#146; and they determined on an annual presidency, with one of their own number, William Thompson, as Wesley's first successor. It was not until 1797 that Coke was elected to the presidential chair. But whenever he was in England he served as secretary, and he was chosen as president a second time in 1805, when there was some fear that he might settle in America. But there was never any question of there being a second Wesley.<h2>
<a name="Worldparish"></a>World parish</h2>In the course of his trans-Atlantic voyages, Coke also paid four visits to the West Indies, where he was instrumental in establishing Methodism in a number of islands; and it is as the pioneer of British Methodist overseas missions that he has chiefly been remembered in England. Methodism was transplanted to the Caribbean in the 1760s by lay persons who had come under its influence back home. Early appeals for spiritual nurture and leadership went unheeded, primarily because Wesley's limited resources were over-stretched by the rapid expansion of British Methodism. It was the enthusiasm of Thomas Coke which persuaded Wesley and the conference to appoint the first missionaries to overseas stations. At the end of 1783 (and eight years before William Carey's better known <span class="italic">Enquiry</span>), in conjunction with Thomas Parker, a Methodist layman from York, he issued a <span class="italic">Plan of the Society for the Establishment of Missions among the Heathens</span>. This first venture was abortive, largely because he failed to enlist Wesley's support in advance. It was, in any case, overtaken by the events of 1784, culminating in the Christmas conference at Baltimore. Two years later, however, Coke returned to the fray with an <span class="italic">Address to the Pious and Benevolent</span>, in which he proposed missions both to the Scottish highlands and islands and the Channel Islands, and to the West Indies and British North America. This time he had taken the precaution of obtaining Wesley's approbation and support; the proposals were given conference approval and Coke sailed for the New World with three of the itinerant preachers who had volunteered for the mission. The party landed in Antigua early on Christmas morning and Coke began a tour of the islands, in the course of which he left missionaries in Antigua, St Vincent, and St Kitts, despite the fact that two of them had been allocated to Newfoundland. This was the first of four visits, as a result of which by 1793, despite strong disapproval in some islands from slave-owning planters and government officials, Caribbean Methodism grew from a single society of 2000 in Antigua to a membership of 6570, with twelve missionaries working in ten of the islands. British Methodism's earliest mission field was firmly established.<br>
<br>During these years Coke was also involved in launching missions to Sierra Leone and India, as well as home missions in Ireland, north Wales, and parts of rural England untouched by Methodism. These ventures placed a considerable financial burden on a movement just emerging into denominationalism, and the Methodist preachers, meeting in their annual conference, gave only hesitant and qualified approval to them. Coke's enthusiasm and vision outran his organizing ability, but it is to his credit that he not only initiated and administered the missions, virtually single-handed, but also undertook their funding by a series of published appeals, by begging tours, and, in the last resort, from his own personal resources. The first effective missionary committee was not appointed until 1804. Its purpose was to contain and regularize what Coke had initiated, and a difficult period of adjustment between him and the new committee followed. But it was not until 1813, on the eve of his departure for India, that effective steps were taken to finance the missions adequately through district missionary societies. By then Coke's right to be considered &#145;father of the missions&#146; was universally, if sometimes grudgingly, recognized.<br>
<br>Despite the peripatetic lifestyle to which he committed himself from 1777 onwards, Coke published a considerable amount, ranging from sermons and missionary reports to extracts from the journal he kept while travelling abroad (published in a collected edition in 1816). His most substantial works were a <span class="italic">Commentary on the Bible</span> in six large volumes (1801&#150;7) and a three-volume <span class="italic">History of the West Indies</span> (1808&#150;11). Both were heavily derivative. He also lent his name to the official life of John Wesley, largely written by Henry Moore and rushed into print in 1792.<h2>
<a name="Personaldetails"></a>Personal details</h2>Coke was short and in later years increasingly stout, with pleasant, boyish features described by Wilberforce as &#145;such a smooth apple face, and little round mouth, that if it had been forgotten you might have made as good a one by thrusting in your thumb&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 3.389&#150;90). He was of a warm-hearted and friendly disposition, but impulsive sometimes to the point of indiscretion and offensiveness. His attitude towards the established church vacillated between outspoken criticism and attempts to repair the bridges between Methodism and the church on both sides of the Atlantic. John Wesley commented wryly that he and Coke were like a louse and a flea. &#145;I creep like a louse, and what I have I keep. Dr. Coke leaps like a flea and is often obliged to leap back again&#146;  (Vickers, <span class="italic">Thomas Coke</span>, 46). His enthusiastic good intentions often led him into na&iuml;vety, as when he made a bid for the proposed new Indian bishopric in 1813. But his faults were the defects of his merits, and his mistakes and errors of judgement may be deemed the price he paid for his considerable achievements. He remained a bachelor until 1805, when he met, fell in love with, and married (1 April) Penelope Goulding Smith (1762&#150;1811), a spinster from Bradford-on-Avon, who was among his more generous missionary subscribers. Her fortune, like his own, was devoted to keeping the missions solvent, but she died after about five years of sharing in his itinerant and hyperactive existence. Within a year (16 December 1811) Coke married Ann Loxdale (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;1812), a well-known Methodist from Shrewsbury. He was devastated by her death on 5 December 1812, declared himself &#145;dead to Europe&#146;  (T. Coke to S. Drew, 28 June 1813, Drew, 350), and flung himself into preparations for a mission to Ceylon and India.<h2>
<a name="MissiontotheEast"></a>Mission to the East</h2>As early as 1784 Coke had had India in his sights and had corresponded with Charles Grant about the possibilities of a mission. But other commitments took priority without ever entirely obliterating the vision. Now, with the renewal of the East India Company's charter, the circumstances seemed right at last. For the last time Coke persuaded a hesitant conference to back his proposals, and six missionaries were recruited to accompany him. They sailed from Portsmouth at the end of 1813 on what was to prove a slow and stormy voyage, Coke devoting much of his time to a study of the Portuguese <span class="roman">Bible</span>. On the morning of 3 May 1814, as they were crossing the Indian Ocean, he was found dead on the floor of his cabin, apparently as the result of a stroke, and was buried at sea that afternoon.<br>
