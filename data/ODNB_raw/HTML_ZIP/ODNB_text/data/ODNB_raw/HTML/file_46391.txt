<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Albert Bushnell</span>  (1871&#150;1946), <span class="occ">missionary in Uganda and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at home, in Bosworth Terrace, King Richard's Road, Leicester, on 22 February 1871, the son of Thomas Howard Lloyd, a druggist, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bushnell. Both his parents were devout Christians, and he had at least one sibling, his sister Elsie. An adventure-loving boy, he read all the African travelogues he could and trained as an engineer to equip himself as an explorer. At the age of eighteen he experienced an evangelical conversion and determined to become a missionary instead.<br>
<br>Accepted by the Church Missionary Society in 1892, Lloyd left for Uganda in 1894 and arrived in March 1895 having walked from the coast through German East Africa. In 1896 he was sent to the western Ugandan Bantu kingdom of Toro, recently restored under its king, Kasagama, by the British authorities. There, as later in Bunyoro, he was friendly with the African ruler and chiefs. During his time in Toro he visited the mission outpost of Mboga (afterwards Boga) in the Belgian Congo where he first met the saintly Ugandan missionary to the Bambuti pygmies, Apolo Kivebulaya. He travelled home on leave via the Congo in 1898. On 15 August 1899 he married Mary Ethel Masters, the daughter of Henry Masters, a draper, at St Mark's Church in New Milverton, Warwickshire; they returned to Uganda together in 1899. Also in 1899 Lloyd published <span class="italic">In Dwarf Land and Cannibal Country</span>; a substantial account of his travels and of Uganda, spiced with adventures with lion and elephant, it was reprinted several times.<br>
<br>On his second tour of service Lloyd worked first in the kingdom of Bunyoro. Then in 1904 he pioneered his mission's first venture into a non-Bantu area of Uganda, going to the Acholi who lived north and east of the Nile. Lloyd himself was the instigator, believing the Acholi to be hungering for the gospel. This proved to be a misapprehension, largely fostered by Bunyoro Christians who reworded enquiries to make them more attractive to the missionaries. Lloyd's account of an exploratory journey to the Acholi in 1903, of what he could learn of the people and their history, and the beginnings of mission work with the Acholi, are among the most valuable sections of <span class="italic">Uganda to Khartoum</span> (1906), another exciting read.<br>
<br>By the end of 1907 it was clear that a series of calamities and the opposition of the Acholi had made the mission untenable. It was temporarily abandoned, and the Lloyds were re-posted to Bunyoro on their return from leave in 1907. Lloyd was ordained deacon and priest in 1909, and the following year he returned to Toro. There he settled down to steady pastoral and administrative church work, including oversight of Mboga where Canon Apolo Kivebulaya worked. Lloyd was made rural dean of Toro in 1916 and archdeacon of western Uganda in 1922, and he remained in Toro until he left Uganda in 1926 to join the mission's home staff.<br>
<br>Lloyd retired in 1930 to become vicar of Combe Down, Bath; from 1936 he was vicar of Stanstead Abbots, Hertfordshire; and finally he became rector of Ladbroke-with-Radbourne, Rugby, in 1938. His ties with Uganda continued: in 1926 he was appointed bishop's commissary of the newly established diocese of the upper Nile, and in 1933&#150;4 he returned to Africa briefly to Mboga after the death of Apolo Kivebulaya. Lloyd's later writings were slight, but they kept Kivebulaya's memory alive until the work of the biographer Anne Luck was published in 1963. Lloyd produced <span class="italic">Dayspring in Uganda</span> in 1921 and three short works about Kivebulaya in 1923, 1928, and 1934; <span class="italic">A Life's Thrills</span>, a brief memoir, was published posthumously in 1948; it comprised mainly a retelling of his earlier works.<br>
<br>Lloyd was an uncritical admirer of British colonialism and believed in the civilizing agency of mission and empire. Like most of his contemporaries he saw his call as one to save Africans from depravity and heathen darkness. Yet he liked and respected his African colleagues and acquaintances, and could not quite square his experience with this stereotype. He found himself profoundly moved, for instance, when a heathen diviner prayed for his safe passage on a dangerous river crossing, and could not believe that these prayers would be unheard by the Christian God  (Lloyd, <span class="italic">Uganda to Khartoum</span>, 103&#150;4). Lloyd died of a brain haemorrhage at his home, 7 Eastnor Grove, Leamington Spa, on 13 December 1946.<br>
