<span class="headword">Major,  Joshua</span>  (1786&#150;1866), <span class="occ">landscape gardener and designer</span>, was born on 28 August 1786 at the estate village of Owston, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, the third of the three children of Richard Major (1736&#150;1809), a general estate labourer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bramma (1742&#150;1830). It is probable that Major attended the village school founded by Frances Davies-Cooke, the estate owner's wife. In 1793 the landscape gardener Humphry Repton prepared a red book for Owston, laying out proposed physical developments for the estate. It is possible that Joshua's father was involved in their implementation and that the work inspired his boyhood interest in landscape design.<br>
<br>It is not known when Major married his wife, Isabella. They had a son, Henry, who became a partner in the nursery garden Major founded at Knowsthorpe, Leeds, about 1810. Initially the firm practised commercial horticulture, and the gardening magazines of the day recorded their successes at flower shows. Later it became involved in landscape design, and in 1845 Major was awarded the first premium for the design of the first public parks in Manchester. The initial concept was unique: the development of a number of neighbourhood parks within easy walking distance for the majority of the city's population. Financial restraints plus the lack of suitable sites resulted in only Peel, Philips, and Queens parks being made of the four initially planned. Among other landscape works were Hanover Square, Leeds (1824); Derwent Hall, Derbyshire (1833); Oakes Park, Sheffield (1834); Wells House, Ilkley, Yorkshire; and the People's Pleasure Ground, Meltham, Yorkshire (<i>c</i>.1860). All these works showed Major to be pragmatic in his approach to landscape design, creating areas for walking and recreation, including open spaces where cricket or football could be played. But, inevitably, his designs became more picturesque. Joseph Paxton's Birkenhead Park (1843) was similar to Major's Manchester parks, but Major never succumbed to the formal Italianate style of gardening as did Paxton in the People's Park, Halifax, and at Sydenham, London.<br>
<br>Major wrote a number of books: <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Insects most Prevalent on Fruit Trees and Garden Produce</span> (1829), <span class="italic">The Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</span> (1852), and <span class="italic">The Ladies' Assistant in the Formation of their Flower Gardens</span> (1861), in which he was assisted by his son. He was a frequent contributor to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span> and corresponded with the editor, J. C. Loudon, especially on the matter of the &#145;ideal&#146; garden for the Victorian villa, and a scheme for such a garden (of 100 acres) by Major was extensively illustrated in Loudon's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Gardening</span> (1871 edn, 1185&#150;91).<br>
<br>In addition to his business interests, Major assisted in the formation of the first Sunday school in Leeds, of which he was the superintendent for many years, and he took an active interest in other religious and charitable institutions of the town. When he died, in Leeds on 26 January 1866, at the age of seventy-nine, his son continued the business, but as a horticultural nursery.<br>
