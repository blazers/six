<span class="headword">Trengrouse,  Henry</span>  (1772&#150;1854), <span class="occ">inventor of life-saving apparatus</span>, was born at Helston, Cornwall, on 18 March 1772, the son of Nicholas Trengrouse (1739&#150;1814) and his wife, Mary Williams (<i>d</i>. 1784). The family had long been the principal freeholders in Helston. Henry was educated at Helston grammar school, and lived in the town all his life. He was a close friend of the Wesleyan preacher, Samuel Drew. On 24 December 1807 he witnessed the wreck of the frigate <i>Anson</i> in Mount's Bay, when over a hundred lives were lost, and this disaster led him to devote his life and inheritance to the discovery of some means for saving the lives of shipwrecked seafarers. His first thought was to devise a lifeboat, but when his efforts produced no satisfactory results, he turned his attention to life-saving apparatus.<br>
<br>As early as 1791 Lieutenant John Bell had devised an apparatus for throwing a line to ships from the shore and, concurrently with Trengrouse, Captain George William Manby was engaged in perfecting an apparatus very similar to Bell's. The idea occurred to Manby in February 1807, and in August he exhibited some experiments to the members of the Suffolk Humane Society. He sought to establish communication between the shore and the shipwreck by means of a line fastened to a barbed shot which was fired from a mortar on the shore. By means of this line a hawser was drawn out from the shore to the ship, and along it was run a cradle in which the shipwrecked persons were landed. This invention had been recommended by various committees, and adopted to some extent before 1814. Trengrouse's apparatus, designed in 1808, was similar to Manby's in the use of the line and hawser, but was fired by a rocket fitted to an adapted musket, and a chair was used instead of a cradle. The advantages were that the rocket was much lighter and more portable than the mortar, the cost was much smaller, and there was little risk of the line breaking, because the velocity of a rocket increases gradually, whereas that of a shot fired from a mortar was so great and sudden that the line was frequently broken. Trengrouse's apparatus could, moreover, be packed in a chest 4&frac14; feet by 1&frac12; feet, and carried on board ship. When stranded, the crew could therefore begin their own rescue, without having to depend on a shore party being available.<br>
<br>It was not, however, until 28 February 1818, after many journeys to London, that Trengrouse could demonstrate his apparatus to Admiral Sir Charles Rowley. A committee was appointed, and on 5 March it reported<blockquote>that Mr. Trengrouse's mode appears to be the best that has been suggested for the purpose of saving lives from shipwreck by gaining a communication with the shore; and, so far as the experiments went, it most perfectly answered what was proposed. (&#145;Letter reporting &hellip; Trengrouse's invention&#146;, 21.361)</blockquote>It was also suggested that a specimen apparatus should be placed in every dockyard that naval officers might become familiar with its working  (ibid.). In the same year a committee of the elder brethren of Trinity House also reported in its favour, and recommended that it should be carried on all vessels. The government ordered twenty sets, but afterwards preferred to have them constructed by the Ordnance department, and paid Trengrouse &pound;50 compensation. In 1821 the Society of Arts awarded him their large silver medal and 30 guineas for the invention. Alexander I of Russia personally wrote to Trengrouse, presented him with a diamond ring in recognition of the usefulness of his apparatus, and invited him to Russia, but apart from the prize awarded by the Society of Arts and the compensation paid by the government, Trengrouse reaped no pecuniary reward from his invention. An improved rocket was later invented by John Dennett in 1826, another by Colonel Boxer in 1855. The rocket completely superseded the mortar, and became an essential part of the operation of saving lives from shipwrecks.<br>
<br>Trengrouse died at Helston on 14 February 1854, survived by his wife, Mary (1772&#150;1863), daughter of Samuel Jenken, three sons and five daughters.<br>
