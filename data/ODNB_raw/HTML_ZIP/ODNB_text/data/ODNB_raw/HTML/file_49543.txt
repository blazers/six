<span class="headword">Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ionn]</span>,  Janet</span>  (1804&#150;1870), <span class="occ">teacher of navigation and supplier of nautical instruments</span>, was born on 13 May 1804 at Wolsingham, co. Durham, the sixth of eight children of the Revd Peter Ionn (1762&#150;1821), master of Wolsingham Free Grammar School, and his wife, Jane Deighton. She attributed her knowledge of navigation to the fact that it was taught by her father and her education probably began at his school. She then attended a small school in London under the patronage of Queen Charlotte, who is said personally to have waived the minimum entry age for her. In 1829 she was in London; on 30 January 1830, at the British ambassador's residence at The Hague, she married George Taylor Jane (1792&#150;1853), a widower with three children. The couple adopted the surname Taylor. She had a small inheritance from her father and spent &#145;several thousand pounds&#146; on the publication of her early books. The first of these, <span class="italic">Luni-Solar and Horary Tables</span>, published in 1833, was hastily prepared and critically reviewed. However, in 1835 she earned recognition for her simplified lunar distance method, with pecuniary rewards from the Admiralty, Trinity House, and later the East India Company, and gold medals from the kings of Holland and Prussia. Her principal works were <span class="italic">Lunar Tables</span> (1834), with seven editions to 1854, and <span class="italic">An Epitome of Navigation</span> (1842), a general textbook, with twelve editions to 1859. Her &#145;mariner's calculator&#146; for solving navigational problems mechanically, patented in 1834, was unsuccessful and soon abandoned.<br>
<br>From 1833 to 1835 the Taylors lived at 6 East Street, Red Lion Square, in Holborn, London, and Janet almost certainly already had pupils for instruction in navigation. In early 1835 she was teaching navigation at 1 Fen Court, Fenchurch Street, and later that year opened a nautical academy and navigation warehouse selling charts and instruments, at 103 Minories. Although the business was listed under her husband's name she took the lead in it. She had the sole agency for Dent's chronometers and offered instrument repairs, and, from 1843, compass adjustment. In 1845 the business, now under her own name, moved to 104 Minories and she hired instrument makers and began manufacturing instruments on the premises. Octants, a sextant, compass, barometers, and a telescope with her name are known and she exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and International Exhibition of 1862. The navigation school expanded steadily as nautical education was gradually formalized.<br>
<br>Janet Taylor had eight children of whom six survived infancy. Her husband died in 1853. He had supported her activities and published some of her books, but he had no settled career and she claimed to be the family breadwinner. She found life difficult without him and in 1860, in recognition of this and her work for seafarers, she was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;50 per annum. About the same time she gave up sole control of her business and by 1868 had retired completely. As a woman Janet Taylor was unique in reaching such prominence in the nautical world. This was achieved not only by competence but also by exceptional determination, particularly in the bold promotion of her work in the highest quarters. She died of bronchitis on 26 January 1870 at her sister's house in St Helen's, Auckland, co. Durham, where she was buried.<br>
