<span class="headword">Raikes,  Charles</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born at Theobalds Park, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 9 December 1812, the son of Job Matthew Raikes (1767&#150;1833), a merchant, formerly of Tunbridge Wells, and his wife, Charlotte Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayly. After a private education and a year at Haileybury College, in 1831 he arrived in Calcutta to take up a writership in the Bengal civil service. He married in 1834 Sophia Mary, daughter of Colonel Mathews of the 31st foot; she died in April the following year, shortly after giving birth to a daughter. On 21 March 1838, while on furlough, he married Justina Davidson, daughter of William Alves of Enham House, Hampshire; they had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1831 until 1853 Raikes was based in the North-Western Provinces, becoming magistrate of Mainpuri in 1849 and publishing <span class="italic">Notes on the North-Western Provinces</span> in 1852. In 1853 he was appointed commissioner of Lahore. Three years later he returned to the North-Western Provinces as an officiating judge in the East India Company's chief court at Agra and remained there throughout the turmoil of 1857 until dispatched in December to Farrukhabad as civil commissioner in charge of areas liberated by Sir Colin Campbell. The uprising&#151;which cost him a daughter, son-in-law (George Christian, commissioner of Sitapur), and two grandchildren&#151;only strengthened his belief that Indians needed to be ruled despotically, a view he aired in <span class="italic">Notes on the Revolt in the North-Western Provinces</span>, published in 1858.<br>
<br>Raikes retired from the civil service in 1860. In 1866 he was made a CSI and in 1867 published a third volume, <span class="italic">The Englishman in India</span>. In retirement he served as a magistrate for Wiltshire and Sussex and commanded a corps of volunteers at Chichester. He died at his home, Mill Gap, Eastbourne, in Sussex, on 16 September 1885. His wife, Justina, had died in 1882. He was survived by several children, including Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Duncan Raikes (1848&#150;1915), commissioner in Upper Burma from 1896 until 1901.<br>
