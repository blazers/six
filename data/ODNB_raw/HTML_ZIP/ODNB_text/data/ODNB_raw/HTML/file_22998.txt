<span class="headword">Radford <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Tanfield]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1562&#150;1630), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in the diocese of Lichfield, probably in Derbyshire because of his subsequent association with the Peak District. He stayed at the English College, Rome, from 20 until 24 December 1584, when he entered the Society of Jesus. He left some time later and on 1 June 1586 he arrived at the English College then situated in Rheims. Ordained priest on 14 March 1587 he was sent to England on 17 January 1589. In 1593 Henry Garnet informed Father General Acquaviva that Radford regretted leaving the society and asked to be re-admitted. His trip to the continent to enter the noviciate in Tournai in the summer of 1594 was cancelled at the last minute because of unspecified dangers. Radford ministered to Catholics in the Peak District. On 3 February 1595 a spy reported that Radford dwelt at Mr Williamson's at Sawly until he kicked Mrs Williamson's dog down the stairs for making noise during mass. The same spy also reported Radford (under the alias of Tanfield), who was &#145;a fine handsome man, having no hair on his face&#146;, at a house owned by Mr Jenison, brother-in-law of the Jesuit John Gerard, at Rowsley near Bakewell  (Morris, 12&#150;13). In August 1599 he was staying with Humphrey Alsop at Butterley, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Radford's <span class="italic">A directorie teaching the way to the truth in a briefe and plaine discourse against the heresies of this time</span> (1605) was apparently written over ten years: his preface was dated 10 April 1594 and the <span class="italic">Epistola dedicatoria</span> to the archpriest George Blackwell 27 March 1599. The treatise asserted that, contrary to the &#145;Adiaphorists&#146; and &#145;Neuters&#146;, there was only one sure path to salvation and he provided proof that the Roman Catholic church was that path. Written &#145;plainly for the simple sorte&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>), the book expounded orthodox Catholic teaching on all controverted matters from the four marks of the true church through justification, predestination, papal primacy, purgatory, and the sacraments to images, prayers, and devotional practices. In 1608, Thomas Manly (alias Rogers) attributed his conversion to Parsons's <span class="italic">Christian Directory</span> and Radford's <span class="italic">Directorie</span>. Indeed, he was later reconciled to the Roman church by Radford himself.<br>
<br>On 30 October 1606 Father Robert Jones (alias North) recommended that Radford be accepted into the society and remain on the mission. Radford accordingly entered the Jesuits in England in 1607. He pronounced his final vows as a spiritual coadjutor in London on 20 January 1619. Jesuit catalogues list him in Northamptonshire from 1621 until 1623 and at the house of probation of St Ignatius, London, from 1623 until 1629. He died at the residence of Blessed Stanislaus in Devon on 9 January 1630.<br>
