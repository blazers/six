<span class="headword">Egley,  William Maw</span>  (1826&#150;1916), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born in Marylebone, London, on 2 October 1826, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8599/', "William Egley (1798&#150;1870)")</script>, artist, and his first wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maw (1796&#150;1852). William Egley was a successful miniature painter and an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and his son was working as his assistant by the age of fifteen.<br>
<br>In 1843 Egley exhibited <span class="italic">A Monk Preaching</span> at the Royal Academy. He began exhibiting at the British Institution in 1844, and at the Society of British Artists in 1846. Most of his early works were drawn from historical and literary sources, including Moli&egrave;re and Shakespeare. In 1848 he created one of the first Christmas cards, an etching illustrating scenes of Christmas charity and festivity. On 16 August 1849 he married, at South Lynn, Norfolk, Mary Ann (1829/30&#150;1883), daughter of Thomas Hubbard, sailmaker. The young couple lived with Egley's parents at 74 Connaught Terrace, London, for the first years of their marriage.<br>
<br>Egley's early works were not particularly well received by critics, and were disparaged for the hardness of their execution and colour. But several of his works were purchased by art unions and their prizewinners, including <span class="italic">The Talking Oak</span> (1857; Detroit Institute of Arts), which was purchased by the Art Union of Glasgow. The style of <span class="italic">The Talking Oak</span> was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, as was his work of the following year, <span class="italic">The Lady of Shalott</span> (1858; Sheffield City Art Galleries), a popular Pre-Raphaelite subject drawn from Tennyson's poem of the same name.<br>
<br>Egley also worked as an assistant to William Powell Frith, the successful painter of modern-life genre pictures. Under Frith's influence he began painting scenes of contemporary life in the mid-1850s. Egley's most successful painting in this vein was <span class="italic">Omnibus Life in London</span> (Tate collection), which he exhibited at the British Institution in 1859. The painting depicts the crowded interior of a bus in Westbourne Grove, and Egley closely studied aspects of the scene from life. He used his friends and relatives as models for the passengers, studied the bus in the yard of a builder, and built a wooden model in his garden to study the light effects. The painting was widely praised for its realistic detail and expressive depiction of character and incident; the Pre-Raphaelite critic F. G. Stephens called it &#145;a subtle little bit of character cleverly worked out&#146;  (Cowling, 104).<br>
<br>Egley's other notable works in modern-life genre include the pair of paintings <span class="italic">As the Twig is Bent</span> and <span class="italic">The Tree's Inclined</span> (Philadelphia Museum of Art), which were exhibited at the Royal Institution of Manchester in 1861 and in the art gallery at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. The first canvas depicts a young boy dressed up as a soldier under the admiring gaze of a blonde girl and the more distant gaze of a dark-haired girl. In the second canvas the trio are young adults and while the grown soldier and the blonde woman flirt, a mirror reflects the image of the brunette, looking on in some dismay.<br>
<br>In the mid-1860s Egley returned to historical and literary scenes, as the fashion for modern-life genre painting began to wane. Towards the end of the century he painted several scenes from Charles Dickens's novels, including a scene from <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> (exh. RA, 1898) and <span class="italic">Florence Dombey in Captain Cuttle's Parlour</span> (1888; V &amp; A), which depicts the young woman in the dress of 1848, when the novel <span class="italic">Dombey and Son</span> was published. The painting was not originally exhibited at any of the major exhibition venues in London, instead touring the country between 1889 and 1895, appearing in exhibitions at places including Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, the Crystal Palace art gallery, Southport, and Brighton. The painting was for sale, and the price was reduced from &pound;40 to &pound;15 over the course of the tour. Such entrepreneurial methods of exhibition and sale were typical of Egley. Over the course of his long career he painted over 1000 works, details of which he recorded in a catalogue now at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He exhibited in a wide range of venues, and sold large numbers of his pictures directly to dealers like Arthur Tooth and Henry Wallis.<br>
<br>Egley died on 20 February 1916 at his home at 32 Chiswick Lane, Chiswick, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. Examples of his work are included in the Tate collection, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sheffield City Art Galleries, and the Holborne Museum of Art in Bath.<br>
