<span class="headword">Lidbury, Sir  Charles</span>  (1880&#150;1978), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 30 June 1880 at the School House, Middlewich, Cheshire, the elder son of Frank Albert Lidbury and his wife, Emily Harding, who were both schoolteachers. He left school when he was thirteen, and in October 1893 applied in Winsford, Cheshire, to Parr's Banking Company, which was growing rapidly in industrial areas by amalgamations. For the rest of his working life Lidbury was employed by Parr's and the London County and Westminster Bank, into which Parr's itself was merged in 1918. The bank was called the Westminster from 1923, and it and the National Provincial joined in 1970 to form the National Westminster Bank.<br>
<br>Lidbury's whole career was characterized by concentrated energy, speed of work, and attention to detail&#151;virtues which he strongly recommended to young bank staff in later years. He progressed through junior posts in Winsford and Sandbach, accompanied by studies at night school, to a major branch in Leicester. He became involved in Parr's amalgamations, and in 1908 his shrewd assessment of figures led to his being in charge of an investigation of the Whitehaven Joint Stock Bank before it was absorbed by Parr's.<br>
<br>His studies completed, Lidbury spent some leisure time in the local yeomanry (he rose to lance-sergeant), but in 1909 ended membership on his marriage to Mary Moreton, the daughter of George Moreton of Kinderton Hall, Middlewich. They had two daughters, and Lidbury from then on had few interests outside the world of finance, his family, and their home, Winter Field, Melbury Abbas, Shaftesbury, Dorset, where he described himself as a part-time farmer and developed some enthusiasm for agriculture. After a spell on the inspection staff, at the age of thirty-four he was made joint branch manager of the bank's Iron Gate branch, Derby, becoming one of Parr's youngest branch managers. Its later merger with Westminster took Lidbury to London, where his shrewdness and skills were valued.<br>
<br>The Westminster in 1913 had created the Westminster Foreign Bank (WFB) and opened branches in Europe, which were loosely controlled through officers of its main bank. Lidbury was made inspector of foreign branches (1919), and in that capacity came to realize that WFB was an ill-devised scheme, embarked upon without real information or intelligent foresight. He restored some unwise lendings, but also curbed future activities. In 1923 he was made superintendent of foreign branches, and in 1924 general manager of WFB&#151;a post he held until 1947. In Westminster Bank itself, after instituting a then novel costing exercise, he became joint general manager in 1927. He helped wind up the Banco Italo-Britannic in 1929, uncovering unsavoury dealings in the process, and in 1930 rescued the ailing Anglo-South-American Bank (he was made a knight commander of the order of Al Morito of Chile) and also became Westminster's chief general manager.<br>
<br>Lidbury had grown up in an industrial district, and was critical of speculative investment in industry. He was not convinced of the long-term wisdom of bank-financed rescue of ailing firms and industries as the 1929&#150;32 depression took its toll, and believed that ideally British commercial banks should be providers of short-term finance only. However, he conceded that in the depression it was necessary to prolong temporarily unrepayable advances, if only because there was little demand for new lendings. He was chairman of the chief executive officers' committee of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers from 1936 to 1947 (after his tenure the chairmanship rotated): during the Second World War he saw the necessity of financial regulation, and was instrumental in keeping it to a minimum. He served as president of the Institute of Bankers (1939&#150;45) and was awarded a knighthood (1941). Lidbury's wife died in 1939. After his London flat was bombed in 1941, he took up residence in the basement strongroom of the Westminster Bank head office for the duration of the war.<br>
<br>By 1943 all the &#145;big five&#146; clearing banks, acutely aware of mounting criticism of their policies, had begun to consider initiatives for post-war finance for small firms. Despite his later opposition to the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), Lidbury himself, at a Liberal Party dinner held in February 1943, surprisingly and influentially called for the creation of an industrial bank to help finance the small businessman. However, he and others were unhappy with the idea that smaller, inherently more risky firms in special areas should get preferential interest rates on loans as the government suggested. Government-sponsored schemes would, it was argued, have banks lending to &#145;the incompetent, the thriftless and the indolent&#146;  (Coopey and Clarke, 21).<br>
<br>A committee of senior managers from the clearing banks was set up, under the auspices of the Bank of England, to draft a blueprint for what later became the ICFC. Lidbury, who was described by a Bank of England official as &#145;the boss-cat of the clearing bank managers&#146;  (Coopey and Clarke, 22), played a dominant role in its proceedings. Despite his opposition, he conceded that &#145;the present political ferments&#146;  (ibid.) called for some response, while attacking what he believed to be an &#145;indirect levy on the resources of the commercial banks for the subsidising of commercial and industrial &#147;adventures&#148; in the interests of the &#147;full employment&#148; campaign&#146;  (ibid.). Lidbury wanted a committee of clearing bankers to vet all applications and ensure that interest rates were not below those offered to their own customers.<br>
<br>In May 1944 Lord Catto replaced Montagu Norman as governor of the Bank of England. Catto stated that he &#145;should like the great ideal to be attempted&#146;  (Coopey and Clarke, 23). After he managed to reassure the chief executives of the banks about their commercial anxieties &#145;there was a cordial exchange of letters with Lidbury&#146;  (Fforde, 721), and detailed discussions about the final shape of the new finance corporation got under way. Later known as 3i, it proved to be Britain's most successful venture-capital entity.<br>
<br>Lidbury was a Liberal supporter, averse neither to Keynesian-style public works in times of failing demand nor to social reform within limits set by the ability to pay. His entirely realistic appraisal of Britain's post-war indebtedness and need for exports, set out in his delayed inaugural address to the Institute of Bankers in October 1945 (&#145;The economic consequences of the war&#146;), was reprinted in a number of journals. He was, however, opposed to any form of bank nationalization, or, mindful of the 1930s, to public disclosure of banks' true profits and reserves, and maintained that banks did not control the economy: they reflected it. At once genial and intolerant, he schooled three men who were to become successively chief general managers of his bank. Unusually, while still Westminster's chief general manager, he was made a board member, but was trenchant in defence of the separation of policy making from execution by its managers. The bank was his to run, and run it he did until his retirement as chief general manager in 1947. He continued as a director until 1962, and hoped to live to be a hundred. He died following an accident at the Harnham Croft Nursing Home, Salisbury, on 25 July 1978. Aged ninety-eight, he had been looked after by his two daughters, who never married.<br>
