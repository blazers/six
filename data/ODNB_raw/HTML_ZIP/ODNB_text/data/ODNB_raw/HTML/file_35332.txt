<span class="headword">Orr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Leighton]</span>,  Alexandra</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Sutherland Orr]</span>  (1828&#150;1903), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born on 23 December 1828 at St Petersburg, where her grandfather, Sir James Boniface Leighton, was court physician to her godmother, Alexandra empress of Russia. She was the eldest of the three surviving children of Frederic Septimus Leighton (1800&#150;1892), a medical doctor, and his wife, Augusta Susan (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1865), daughter of George Augustus Nash of Edmonton, Middlesex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16399/', "Frederic Leighton, Lord Leighton (1830&#150;1896)")</script>, was her only brother. The family travelled extensively in Europe, and Alexandra was educated privately abroad, in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, and at a girls' boarding-school at Frankfurt am Main. When she was sixteen she had a serious attack of rheumatic fever in Florence which left her partly blind, and she spent more than seven years recovering in Hampstead, Middlesex, with her mother. On account of her near blindness, most of her very considerable knowledge was acquired by listening to books read aloud to her.<br>
<br>On 7 March 1857 Alexandra Leighton married a widower, Sutherland George Gordon Orr of the Madras service, commandant of the 3rd regiment of cavalry, Hyderabad contingent, and she went with him to India. They arrived during the Indian mutiny, and Alexandra had a narrow escape from Aurangabad, having been saved by the fidelity to the English of Sheikh Baran Bukh. Her husband died there on 19 June 1858, worn out by the war. He was gazetted captain and brevet major and CB on the day of his death. Alexandra then returned to England and rejoined her parents, who were sojourning in Bath and Scarborough. It was about this time, in 1860, that Lord Leighton painted her portrait as a beautiful young widow. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1861, and Leighton wrote that it was more admired than anything else. (Previously Alexandra had sat for the figure of the Moor's wife in <span class="italic">Othello and Desdemona</span>.) However, she did not settle in London until she moved there with her father in 1869, after her mother's death four years earlier.<br>
<br>Alexandra Orr's main interests were in art, music, and literature. In the winter of 1855&#150;6 she had met in Paris Robert Browning, with whom her brother was close. Browning renewed his acquaintance with her at intervals until 1869, when, both residing in London, they became good friends. For many years he read books to her twice a week, and they used to meet in her brother's studio. She joined the Browning Society shortly after its formation in 1881, became a member of the committee which wrote notes on various difficult points in Browning's poems, and was generous in financial support. The most important result of this connection was <span class="italic">A Handbook to the Works of Robert Browning</span> (1885; 3rd edn, 1887), which she wrote at the request of the society. It contains ample contributions by Browning, who wrote many of the notes and indices himself, and is a kind of descriptive catalogue, based partly on the historical order and partly on the natural classification of the poems, owing something to the suggestions of the painter and author John Trivett Nettleship. The sixth edition, incorporating her final corrections, was often reprinted.<br>
<br>Alexandra Orr's most important work, however, was her <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Robert Browning</span>, published in 1891, largely based on material supplied by Browning's sister. Many new letters by the poet have come to light during the twentieth century&#151;and countless more studies and biographies have been written&#151;but Orr's retains the value of a book written by a personal friend. Her estimate of Browning's religious opinions, particularly his views on spiritualism and on the Theosophical Society, caused considerable controversy, and she answered her critics in an article in the December 1891 issue of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. To that and other periodicals she contributed occasional articles on art and literature, as well as on women's suffrage, of which she was a strong opponent. Her last literary efforts were two editions of her brother's <span class="italic">Addresses Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy by the Late Lord Leighton</span> (1896; 1897). All her works were dictated, as her vision was too weak to allow her to write or read.<br>
<br>After her father's death in 1892, Alexandra Orr continued to live in their mansion at 11 Kensington Park Gardens, London, until her own death, from a lingering pulmonary disease, on 23 August 1903. She was buried on 29 August in Locksbrook cemetery, Bath, alongside her parents. She had no children.<br>
