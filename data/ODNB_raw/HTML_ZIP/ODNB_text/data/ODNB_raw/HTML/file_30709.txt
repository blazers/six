<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett,  George Macdonald</span>  (1892&#150;1959), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Lincoln on 25 October 1892, the youngest of the three children of the Revd John Ebenezer Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1906), teacher and Baptist minister, and his wife, Hanna Martha (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of William Grange, a farmer in Hertfordshire. He was named after the novelist and children's writer George MacDonald (1824&#150;1905), a friend of his father. In 1893 his father moved to a living in Hackney, and about 1899 to Clacton-on-Sea, where he ran a private boarding-school.<br>
<br>Bennett was a pupil at the school for ten years. The science teacher, who took over the running of the school when J. E. Bennett died, was Harold Picton, a pupil of William Ramsay. Under Picton's influence Bennett developed a liking for chemistry and decided to take it up as a career. He obtained a London University exhibition in 1909 and entered East London (later Queen Mary) College as an internal student, subsequently obtaining a scholarship in chemistry. In 1911 he took an external BA degree, and in the following year he was awarded first-class honours in chemistry. He then began research in organic chemistry but in 1913 he obtained an open exhibition at St John's College, Cambridge, becoming a foundation scholar in the following year. In 1915 he obtained a first class in chemistry in part two of the natural science tripos and became a research assistant to William Pope, with whom, and with C. S. Gibson, he made important contributions in the field of explosives and war gases. Notably, he carried out the first experiment for making mustard gas from disulphurdichloride and ethylene, work which led to his sustained interest in sulphur chemistry.<br>
<br>In 1918 Bennett left Cambridge to take up a post in industry, where he worked on the commercial production of citric acid from cane sugar. He was unhappy there, however, and in 1921 became a senior demonstrator in the chemistry department of Guy's Hospital medical school. In 1924 he became lecturer in organic chemistry in the University of Sheffield, where he built up an enthusiastic research team. In 1931 he was appointed to the university's Firth chair of chemistry.<br>
<br>In 1938 Bennett became professor of organic chemistry at King's College, London, and was in charge of the chemistry department when the college was evacuated to Bristol at the outbreak of war in 1939. There, in addition to his teaching and administrative duties, he carried out studies on the mechanism of aromatic nitration which were of great importance in relation to the development of explosives. King's College returned to London in 1943 but in 1945 Bennett left academic work to become the government chemist. Despite a serious heart condition he undertook much administrative work and actively encouraged the development of links with industry and other government departments. He also maintained a close contact with the academic world through the University of London, the Chemical Society, and the Royal Society, and he was especially concerned in the development of new experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy, and gas chromatography.<br>
<br>Bennett obtained the degrees of PhD (London, 1924) and ScD (Cambridge, 1932). He was a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge (1917&#150;23), and was elected a fellow of Queen Mary College in 1939 and FRS in 1947. In 1948 he was appointed CB. He generously devoted his time to the service of chemistry, and was a member of the council of the Chemical Society (1929&#150;32), honorary secretary (1939&#150;46), and vice-president (1948&#150;51); he was a member of the council of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (1949&#150;51) and its vice-president (1951&#150;3). He was also a member of the council of the Faraday Society (1946&#150;8) and honorary secretary of the Chemical Council (1945&#150;51).<br>
<br>Bennett was a scrupulous and conscientious scientist. Reserved in nature, he could show tremendous excitement when research investigations were going well. He was rigorous in his dealings with students, and only the hard worker received his fullest support. He was a prolific reader but his main interest was always chemistry and apart from walking he had few outdoor activities. His contributions to chemical knowledge ranged over a wide field and he was author or joint author of some ninety publications, most of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>.<br>
<br>Bennett suffered a severe heart attack in 1953, after which he did little beyond his official duties at the Government Laboratory. In 1918 he had married Doris, daughter of James Laycock MPS, of Fulham; they had no children, and when she died in 1958 he was devastated. Bennett died on 9 February 1959 at his home, 74 Kingsmead Avenue, in Worcester Park, Surrey, after a further heart attack. He left the bulk of his estate to Dr Barnardo's Homes.<br>
