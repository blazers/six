<span class="headword">Herbert, Lady  Mary</span>  (1686&#150;1775), <span class="occ">speculator and mining entrepreneur</span>, was the eldest of the six children born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13061/', "William Herbert, second marquess of Powis (1657x61&#150;1745)")</script>, and his wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. after 1664, <i>d</i>. 1724), elder daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Preston, baronet, of Furness, Lancashire. At the revolution of 1688 she went into exile with her mother. Her father, a leading Jacobite, eventually joined them in Flanders, where Mary was educated at the English Benedictine convent at Ghent. Her father succeeded to the titular (Jacobite) dukedom of Powis in 1696. As a young woman, Mary became the companion of her paternal aunt Anne, Lady Carrington, the widow of Francis, second Viscount Carrington. After 1715 they travelled between Paris and London, carrying messages from the earl of Mar to English Jacobites. In 1718, when the match between James Stuart and Clementina Sobieska was in jeopardy, Lord Panmure proposed Lady Mary, probably at her own suggestion, as a possible alternative bride for the Pretender.<br>
<br>Soon after the launch of the Louisiana, or Mississippi, Company by John Law in 1717 Lady Mary became a leading speculator and reputed millionaire. Her wealth and status as the daughter of a duke attracted some eminent suitors, including Philippe de Bourbon, chevalier de Vend&ocirc;me and grand prior of France, and the duc d'Albret, but she rejected their overtures. She had by now linked her fortunes with those of the gambler and speculator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10273/', "Joseph Gage")</script>, younger son of Joseph Gage (1652&#150;1700), of Firle, Sussex, and (from about 1682) of Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire. In 1719&#150;20 Gage and Herbert played the stock and money markets with spectacular results, banking on a continuing rise in the value of Mississippi shares, and relying on the infallibility of Law's &#145;system&#146;. By the spring of 1720 Lady Mary's equity stake amounted to some 6.5 million livres, and she had drawn her father, her two brothers, and Lady Carrington into her web as co-guarantors of massive loans drawn on the Irish banker Richard Cantillon, in Paris, and on Samuel Edwin, in London. When Law's paper empire collapsed in May 1720, the whole Herbert family was involved in her ruin, with total debts estimated at &pound;170,000. To recoup their losses, Gage and the Herberts sued Cantillon for usury, and Mary's two brothers sued her for deceit and fraud. Gage went into hiding, and Lady Mary and Lady Carrington were briefly confined in a debtors' prison in Paris. The Herberts' properties were mortgaged, and their lucrative lead mines at Llangynog were handed over to trustees.<br>
<br>In 1726 Lady Mary relaunched herself as a mining entrepreneur, exploiting her family's reputation for mining to seek a concession to reopen and work disused silver and copper mines in Andalusia. In 1727 she signed a contract with the Espa&ntilde;ola Company in Madrid whereby she undertook to drain and work the silver mine at Guadalcanal, in the province of Seville. She and Lady Carrington moved to Seville that year, accompanied by Gage, who acted as works manager. The mine was successfully drained by September 1732, but the Espa&ntilde;ola Company reneged on the contract and prolonged litigation ensued while Gage prospected elsewhere. In 1732 Gage and Herbert were satirized in Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Epistle to Bathurst</span> (lines 129&#150;34) as avaricious gold-diggers. Pope incorrectly located their mining operations in Asturias. On the basis of services rendered, Gage made several attempts to obtain Lady Mary's hand in marriage, but she eluded him by procrastination.<br>
<br>In 1740 Lady Mary's litigation reached a successful conclusion, and she was granted the rights for thirty years to the five mines of Guadalcanal, Cazalla, Galaroza, Rio Tinto (potentially the most valuable), and Aracena. In 1743 she returned to Paris in order to raise capital for their exploitation, but her credit was now exhausted&#151;as were the Herberts' resources. Though mining proceeded spasmodically in her absence, little progress was made, and she finally forfeited the concession in 1767.<br>
<br>Lady Mary's later years were devoted to further speculation, intrigue, and matchmaking. At his death in 1748 her brother, the third marquess of Powis, bequeathed his estate to his distant cousin Henry Arthur, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, a protestant and a whig. To secure the succession in perpetuity, Lord Herbert (created earl of Powis in 1748) was eager to arrange a marriage with Barbara Herbert, the third marquess's only child, and Lady Mary offered her services in delivering the young heiress to her fate. In return she was to receive an annuity, but the earl reneged on their unwritten agreement. She sued him for breach of promise, and obtained a generous settlement from the House of Lords in 1766.<br>
<br>In 1750 Lady Mary had accepted the prince de Conti's offer of an apartment in the H&ocirc;tel de Boisbodron, Temple, Paris, where she spent her declining years&#151;an object of curiosity to visitors, such as Horace Walpole, who were acquainted with her legend. False reports of her clandestine marriage to Joseph Gage were still current at her death, which occurred at the H&ocirc;tel de Boisbodron in September 1775. She was buried in Paris. Joseph Gage predeceased her in 1766.<br>
