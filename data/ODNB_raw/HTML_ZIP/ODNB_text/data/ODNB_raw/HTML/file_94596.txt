<span class="headword">Newell,  Norman</span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">record producer and songwriter</span>, was born at 34 Liddon Road, Plaistow, London, on 25 January 1919, the son of Sydney Edward Newell, boiler stoker and later foreman road builder, and his wife, Mary Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burke. His father, who had served as a private in the labour corps during the First World War, suffered premature blindness, and as a consequence Newell's mother was forced to support the family on a meagre income. Illness blighted Newell's early life, and a bout of scarlet fever forced him to miss the eleven-plus examination. He went on to excel at poetry and English at his secondary school in Plaistow but at fourteen he left and took a job in the offices of the local bus garage at Upton Park.<br>
<br>In 1937 Newell joined the Royal Artillery. While spending much of the Second World War stationed at Yeovil, organizing shows and revues for the troops, he befriended the comedian Bill Waddington (later Percy Sugden in ITV's <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span>), writing lyrics for Waddington's stage music. Once the war had ended, a further spell in hospital found Newell in the same ward as Waddington. When he recovered he was able to follow up Waddington's recommendation to apply for a position at the Cinephonic Music Publishers in Charing Cross Road. He was ostensibly employed to sell sheet music, but when a Cinephonic songwriter fell ill he was encouraged to try his hand at songwriting. His first song to be published was &#145;My Lovely World and You&#146;, and the best known of his early songs was &#145;Nice to Know You Care&#146; (1949), a collaboration with the pianist Leslie Baguley, recorded by Tommy Dorsey and later by the Dallas Boys and Tony Brent.<br>
<br>The British popular music industry of the immediate post-war era was heavily reliant on American songs, and the emergence of a writer with potential ensured a rapid rise. Despite never having produced a record, in 1949 Newell was poached by the recording giant EMI for the position of staff producer at Columbia Records. At this stage Columbia was a British record label in name only and nearly all of its releases were the result of licensing deals with its American namesake, which EMI had sold off in the 1930s. Early in the 1950s, however, this complex series of licences began to lapse and Newell found that he had to search for fresh British talent to keep Columbia active&#151;effectively placing him in the position not only of staff producer but also of head of artists and repertoire. As a consequence he assembled a formidable array of British popular music recording stars. His first recording production, &#145;Put your Shoes on Lucy&#146; (1949), was for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Petula Clark, who was reinventing herself as a popular singer after outgrowing a juvenile acting career. Clark only recorded four songs with Newell and by 1952 had moved away from Columbia, but her association with Newell was the foundation of her success as a popular singer. She later went on to record many hits for Pye Records, but her version of the continental hit &#145;Sailor&#146; (1961, with English lyrics written by Newell under the pseudonym of David West) gave her a second lease of life in the British charts.<br>
<br>Newell's first hit record as a producer came in 1950 with &#145;Les Trois Cloches&#146;, recorded by the French male voice choir Les Compagnons de la Chanson. He was also successful with the Irish tenor Josef Locke (notably with his &#145;Goodbye&#146;, 1947), the whistler Ronnie Ronalde, the Beverley Sisters (whom he discovered), Dorothy Squires, and the strict-tempo dance orchestra of Victor Sylvester. He also discovered the balladeer Steve Conway, who had a sizeable hit with Newell's composition &#145;My Thanks to You&#146; in 1950. In 1953, after a somewhat frustrating period with EMI, who were allegedly paying him a meagre &pound;11 per week, Newell tried his luck as a songwriter for MGM in the USA. It was an unsuccessful and unremarkable period for Newell, who returned home after only six months. On his return to the UK, Decca Records attempted to poach him, but to no avail. His return to Columbia in 1954 coincided with another major hit record, the comedian Norman Wisdom's straight ballad &#145;Don't Laugh at Me&#146;. One of Newell's biggest signings for Columbia was the pianist Russ Conway, who recorded twenty instrumental hit singles between 1957 and 1962, including two number ones in 1959, &#145;Side Saddle&#146; and &#145;Roulette&#146;. While never professing an affiliation with rock and roll, Newell grasped the significance of the new music, and in the latter half of the 1950s also produced albums of music from the television shows <span class="italic">6.5 Special</span> and <span class="italic">Drumbeat</span> for another EMI imprint, <span class="roman">Parlophone</span>, which achieved sizeable sales. He brought together Adam Faith and the arranger John Barry, and together they made the hit record of 1959, &#145;What Do You Want?&#146;<br>
<br>Following a licence deal struck by Philips with Columbia (CBS) Newell's residual agreements with the American giant enabled him to produce British recordings for Philips while retaining his position at EMI. It was for Philips in 1957 that he first recorded the young black British singer Shirley Bassey. That same year he recorded the thirteen-year-old Laurie London singing &#145;He's Got the Whole World in His Hands&#146; for EMI, with a musical arrangement by his friend and colleague Geoff Love. It was with Newell that Love went on to record several easy-listening albums with massive sales under the titles <span class="italic">Manuel</span> and <span class="italic">Manuel and his Music of the Mountains</span>. &#145;Manuel&#146; also enjoyed singles chart successes (with Newell again producing) with &#145;The Honeymoon Song&#146; in 1959 and &#145;Never on a Sunday&#146; in 1960. Newell's English lyrics to the continental hit songs of the early 1960s &#145;Portrait of My Love&#146; and &#145;More&#146; were undoubtedly among his most significant contributions to popular music. Indeed Matt Monro's recording of &#145;Portrait of My Love&#146; (1960) was one of the most memorable British popular music records of the twentieth century&#151;a perfect blend of the creative, the technical, and the human. Newell used more than thirty-five different pseudonyms for his song-writing credits, later explaining that &#145;it might seem that I would be using undue influence if I got my artists to record my songs&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Newell was not a major player in the musical sea changes of the 1960s but he was credited with the discovery of the duo Peter and Gordon after seeing them at the Pickwick Club in London, and although he was not responsible for any of the Beatles' recordings on EMI's <span class="roman">Parlophone</span> label, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison were welcome guests at Newell's home. He did have an ear for the unexpected, however, and produced several successful Jake Thackray albums for Columbia: after seeing Thackray on the BBC television show <span class="italic">That's Life</span> Newell moulded him into a unique and talented recording troubadour. Newell also produced the top-selling single of 1965, &#145;Tears&#146;, by the Liverpool comedian Ken Dodd, and followed this by helping to restore the fortunes of another Liverpool entertainer, Frankie Vaughan, in 1967 with a hit recording of the old song &#145;There Must Be a Way&#146;. He also created an unlikely pop star out of the comedian Des O'Connor, providing him between 1967 and 1970 with a stream of Dean Martin-sounding hit productions.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Newell's major achievement&#151;at least within EMI&#151;was centred more on his recordings of the Sadler's Wells Opera Company. When in 1958 Sadler's Wells achieved a London success with <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> Newell secured the rights to record an LP of highlights. The following year he made a hugely successful recording of highlights from the Sadler's Wells production of <span class="italic">Madame Butterfly</span>. Sales of these two LPs were so good that he continued to record Sadler's Wells over the next six years, producing twelve further recordings and capturing the Sadler's Wells Company at a sparkling moment in its long history. When EMI and Paul Hamlyn Publishing jointly launched their budget <span class="roman">Music for Pleasure</span> label in 1965 Newell began recording cover versions of West End shows, enabling in the process a stream of original cast recording copyrights to flow into EMI. These became the mainstay of the company's light music catalogue for many years and made Newell, already well respected at EMI, something of an exemplar.<br>
<br>Newell finally left EMI in the late 1960s, becoming, like George Martin before him, a freelance producer. He continued to work with Geoff Love and Shirley Bassey. Of his productions with the latter in the early 1970s&#151;a successful period that witnessed Bassey's return to the singles charts after a long absence&#151;Bassey avowed, &#145;Norman knows more about me than I do. Every line of &#145;This Is My Life&#146; was written with me in mind&#146;  (private information). Certainly Bassey's recordings of two Newell songs from this period (&#145;Never, Never, Never&#146; and &#145;This Is My Life&#146;) were ageless.<br>
<br>Despite several casual projects such as an album with Bette Davis in the 1980s, Newell's later life was markedly less demanding. Technically he &#145;retired&#146; in 1990 to his home in Rustington, Sussex, but he continued working with various artists including Les Reed until three years before his death. His house was crowded with awards that included a Grammy, an Emmy, a Golden Globe, three Ivor Novello awards, and six BMI awards. (He had also received an Oscar nomination for his lyrics to the song &#145;More&#146; in 1963.) Following a series of debilitating strokes in 2001 he was forced to move to a local nursing home, Rustington Hall, close to the home of his long-term friend and agent Alan Lockey. It was there that he received his insignia as OBE in February 2004 from the lord lieutenant of Sussex, and there too that he died on 1 December 2004. He had never married, and had no children.<br>
<br>Newell was one of the great British popular music stalwarts of the late twentieth century. Not only did he achieve success by means of his own abilities in songwriting, but his production methods and talent spotting created long-term careers both nationally and internationally for numerous British performers. He was an important conduit in a creative industry that thrived on networks, and his honesty and integrity were exemplary in a business frequently accused of manipulation. His success demonstrated that the music industry remained a &#145;people&#146; industry and that &#145;vertical integration&#146; (of songwriting, talent spotting, production, and so on) was a profitable system in both economic and artistic terms.<br>
