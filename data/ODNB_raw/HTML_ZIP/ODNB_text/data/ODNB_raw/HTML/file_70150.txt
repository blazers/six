<span class="headword">Grunfeld,  Isidor</span>  (1900&#150;1975), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born on 27 October 1900 in Tauberettersheim, near W&uuml;rzburg, Bavaria, the eldest son of wealthy cattle drover and agricultural merchant Joseph Grunfeld and his second wife, Carolina Fromm. Both his parents claimed family connections with important rabbis. Joseph was a descendant of Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg, and Carolina was related to Rabbi Isaac Dov (Seligman Baer) Bamberger of W&uuml;rzburg, as well as being a cousin of the psychoanalyst Eric Fromm. Joseph Grunfeld's first wife had died during or just after the First World War, leaving four young children, two boys and two girls. Carolina bore seven more children; the combined family, which was brought up as a single unit, consisted of six boys and five girls.<br>
<br>Isidor Grunfeld was educated privately by a Lithuanian rabbi who taught him the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> in Yiddish. From 1920 to 1925 he studied law and philosophy at Frankfurt and Heidelberg universities, gaining a doctorate in comparative Roman and Talmudic law. While pursuing a secular education, Grunfeld continued at <i>yeshivot</i> (Talmudic colleges) in these towns and, something of a student activist at a time of rising nationalist tensions, was knifed in an incident at Marburg. He was for a short time senior master in mathematics and <span class="roman">Talmud</span> at the Jewish secondary school in Hamburg. He then pursued a legal career. He was called to the bar at the county court of W&uuml;rzburg and acted as assessor of the juvenile court.<br>
<br>Grunfeld's father had been a supporter of the Hovevei Tsion (&#145;Lovers of Zion&#146;), a proto-Zionist society which advocated agricultural colonization in Palestine. Isidor Grunfeld joined the German Zionist Federation and afterwards the <i>Mizrakhi</i> religious Zionist organization. Grunfeld married Dr Judith Rosenbaum, a schoolteacher [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75144/', "Grunfeld, Judith (1902&#150;1998)")</script>], in W&uuml;rzburg on 22 November 1932; they had five children, two daughters followed by three sons. When Hitler came to power in 1933 Grunfeld, as a former student activist, was warned that he was in danger of arrest. He left for Strasbourg on the day the Brownshirts came to pick him up. Judith followed him a week later and their first child was born there that year; their four other children, another daughter and three sons, were later born in England. In 1933 Grunfeld spent eight months in Palestine, where he hoped to pursue his legal career, articled to Mordechai Eliash, later first Israeli ambassador to Britain.<br>
<br>Advised to move to England, Isidor and Judith were reunited in 1934 in London, where he read for the English bar with a view to returning to Palestine on qualifying. His plans were overtaken by the urgent need to rescue his mother and siblings from Germany. In 1938 he provided affidavits for nine brothers and sisters, all of whom (except one brother) travelled on from London to the USA; they were later joined by his mother. Only one sister remained in Germany, and she was murdered in the holocaust. Grunfeld enrolled at Jews' College and qualified for the rabbinate in 1938. He served as minister of the Finsbury Park District (United) Synagogue between 1936 and 1938 and took up permanent residence in Green Lanes, north London. However, his rare combination of legal and rabbinical training was quickly put to more direct use. Chief Rabbi J. H. Hertz recruited Grunfeld as the first registrar to the London <i>bet din</i> (Jewish ecclesiastical court), in 1939 he was promoted <i>dayan</i> (judge), and in 1951 senior <i>dayan</i>, as successor to Rabbi Yehezkel Abramsky. During the Second World War, Grunfeld narrowly escaped when the offices of the <i>bet din</i> in Mulberry Street, off Commercial Road, east London, were bombed. In 1952, together with Rabbi Alexander Altmann of the Manchester <i>bet din</i>, Grunfeld assumed the temporary role of acting chief rabbi, while Israel Brodie was away on a pastoral tour of Australia. He retired from the <i>bet din</i> in 1965 after a serious heart attack the previous year. At this time he was privately unhappy at the harsh treatment meted out to Rabbi Louis Jacobs, one of the most gifted religious thinkers produced by Anglo-Jewry, whose outspoken unorthodox views may have cost him the chief rabbinate.<br>
<br>In January 1946 Chief Rabbi Hertz asked Grunfeld to take his place as the first witness called to testify before the Anglo-American commission of inquiry into Palestine, being held in London. Indeed, throughout the late 1930s and during the Second World War, Grunfeld evinced deep personal interest in the plight of the Jews of Europe. In 1940 he was acting chairman of the chief rabbi's Religious Emergency Council, set up to aid refugees from Nazism. In this capacity he went to Cyprus to report on conditions in the internment camps. He organized welfare provision for some 5000 Jewish refugees and lobbied for their entry into Palestine. He was also chairman of the commission on the status of Jewish war orphans in Europe, dedicated after the war to retrieving Jewish children who had been sheltered in Christian homes and restoring them to the Jewish community. He made an emotional appeal to the Human Rights Commission on this issue. He served as chairman of the Anglo-Jewish Association and the Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief. He was active in Amnesty International and spoke out in favour of world peace.<br>
<br>Grunfeld was a prolific writer in English on Jewish religious themes, and published several popular titles as well as articles in the general press. He wrote a two-volume study of the Jewish dietary laws and another about the will and testament in Jewish law. He devoted his retirement to editing and annotating English translations of the writings of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, the German founder of neo-Orthodoxy. Hirsch's philosophy, which combined strict adherence to Jewish tradition and interaction with the modern secular world, greatly influenced Grunfeld's own life. Aged seventy-five, Isidor Grunfeld died in the Royal Northern Hospital, Holloway, London, of a heart attack on 8 September 1975 and was buried the same day in the Har Menuhot cemetery in Jerusalem.<br>
