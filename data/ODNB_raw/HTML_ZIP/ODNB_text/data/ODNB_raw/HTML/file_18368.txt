<span class="headword">Maule,  Patrick</span>, first earl of Panmure  (1585&#150;1661), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 29 May 1585, probably at Bolshan, Forfarshire, the son of Patrick Maule (1548&#150;1605), fiar of Panmure, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1599), daughter of Sir John Erskine of Dun. In March 1600 his father succeeded Thomas Maule as laird of Panmure. By 1603 the seventeen-year-old Maule was serving as page to James VI, who had been impressed by his &#145;cariage&#146; in royal hunting expeditions  (MacFarlane, 2.153). In April he accompanied the king to England and served as groom of the bedchamber under Sir George Home, who arranged for his livery and annual payment of &pound;20. On 1 May 1605 Maule succeeded his father as thirteenth laird of Panmure, but remained at Whitehall, where he was then earning &pound;65 per annum as one of the king's servants. On 7 March 1610 the king granted him the lands and barony of Panmure. In 1616 Maule married Frances, daughter of the late Sir Edward Stanhope of Grimston, Yorkshire. Before her death in January 1624, the couple had four children: George Maule, Lord Brechin (1619&#150;1671); Henry Maule (<i>bap</i>. 1621, <i>d</i>. 1667) of Balmakellie; Jean (<i>d</i>. 1685); and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1647). Maule was appointed to supervise repairs at Eltham Park on 28 March 1621, and by early 1625 was made its keeper.<br>
<br>Retaining his personal popularity with King Charles, on 4 May 1625 Maule was given the manor of Collyweston in Northamptonshire (which he sold to Attorney-General Sir Robert Heath in 1631). His inoffensive personality gained him the support of the duke of Buckingham, who wrote to the king while on campaign in France (August 1627), recommending that Maule be appointed gentleman usher. It was during this period that he married his second wife, Mary Waldrum (<i>d</i>. 1637), a maid of honour to the queen. Maule maintained his Scottish connections with his receipt of Downie barony in March 1629 and through his personal appearance at Holyroodhouse on 5 September 1632 to accept the principal sheriffship of Forfar. This was soon followed by his honorary appointment as burgess of Dundee &#145;for the innumerable benefits which he has conferred on the said Burgh&#146;  (Millar, 144). He expanded his business interests in the 1630s, obtaining a special grant of British exports to Africa (13 October 1634) and a thirty-one-year monopoly on soap manufacture (6 November). After his grant of the baronies of Brechin, Navar, and Balmakellie on 15 October 1634, he began to take a keener interest in Scottish affairs, serving as JP for Forfar and depute of the admiralty between Southwater and Bruchtie, in addition to asserting his rights over appointments to the magistracy of Brechin, over those claimed with equal vehemence by the bishop. Maule also happened to be present in Scotland during the prayer book riots of 1637.<br>
<br>On 15 July 1639 Maule married his third wife, Lady Mary Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1672), widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15277/', "William Keith, fifth Earl Marischal")</script>, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8867/', "John Erskine, eighteenth earl of Mar")</script>. Throughout this period he expressed sympathies with the supplicants and later with the covenanters, as shown in his correspondence with his nephew Alexander Erskine of Dun and the earl (later marquess) of Montrose, though he never wavered in his personal loyalty to the king. From 1642 to 1643 he attended Charles at York and Oxford, and was eventually elevated to the peerage on 2 August 1646 as the earl of Panmure, Lord Maule of Brechin and Navar. He was one of the few bedchamber servants to remain with the king, and reputedly the last to leave him at Carisbrooke Castle, though there is no evidence to suggest that he followed the king from Hampton Court to the Isle of Wight in 1647. His reputation for loyalty led to a place on the commission of war for Kincardine and Forfar on 15 February 1648, and by 2 March he was in attendance at parliament in Edinburgh, listed thirtieth among thirty-two earls.<br>
<br>Oliver Cromwell seems to have distrusted Panmure, perhaps resenting his implication in Charles's escape from Hampton Court on 11 November 1647 and his subsequent gift of &pound;2000 to the exiled Charles II in 1651. In April 1654 the protector fined him &pound;10,000 under the <span class="roman">Act of Grace and Pardon</span>, a massive sum which was reduced to &pound;4000 in March 1655. After issuing payment on 26 June, Panmure spent his last years trying to secure revenues, such as that of the Irish customs, and serving as commissioner to collect assessments in Forfar. Throughout his bedchamber career he had been able to revitalize his family's estates which had reached a low ebb in the late sixteenth century under his grandfather Thomas. Panmure himself died on 22 December 1661, probably at Panbride, and was soon afterward buried in the family vaults at Panbride. His widow died in December 1672.<br>
