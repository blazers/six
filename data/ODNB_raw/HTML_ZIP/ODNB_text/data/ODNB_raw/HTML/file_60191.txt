<span class="headword">Bryan,  Benjamin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Big Ben]</span>  (1753&#150;1794), <span class="occ">prize-fighter</span>, sometimes named Benjamin Brian or Brain, was born in Bristol; nothing is known about his parents or upbringing. It is unclear whether he had any formal education; however, letters (apparently from Bryan) which appeared in the press towards the end of his life suggest that he was literate. During his early years Bryan worked as a collier in Kingswood, Bristol, during which time he defeated two noted fighters, Clayton and Harris. In 1774 he moved to London, working for several years as a coal porter at a wharf in the Strand. &#145;Good looking, clean and respectable&#146;  (Miles, 65), Bryan had a mild and sociable demeanour, stood 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed less than 14 stone.<br>
<br>Bryan's prize-fighting career began on 31 October 1786 when he defeated the &#145;Fighting Grenadier&#146; at Bloomsbury. Bryan owed this victory to the intervention of a physician who, taking advantage of a disruption to the bout, lanced a swelling on Bryan's eye, enabling the badly bruised fighter to continue the contest. On 31 December 1788, in a bout that took place in atrocious weather, Bryan defeated Corbally at Navestock, Essex. In the following year he was due to fight the legendary pugilist Tom Johnson for &pound;500, but had to pay &pound;100 default because his health was too poor to take part in the bout. By 23 October 1789 he had recovered sufficiently for him to defeat Jacombs at Banbury in a &#145;most dreadful battle of one hour and twenty six minutes&#146;  (Miles, 66&#150;7). On 30 August 1790 Bryan tried to fight the &#145;Tinman&#146; Bill Hooper at Newbury for 100 guineas, but after receiving one blow Hooper became so frightened that instead of fighting he:<blockquote>fell every time Ben's hand reached him, and even before; ran all over the stage, filled his mouth with water and spirted it in Ben's face, accompanied by provoking and blackguard epithets to irritate Ben and throw him off his guard. (ibid., 67)</blockquote>Hooper fell 133 times and after three and a half hours, and with night having set in, the bout was declared drawn  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, 4, 1794, 77).<br>
<br>Despite the farcical nature of this contest Bryan's patron, the duke of Hamilton, was sufficiently impressed to back him for 500 guineas for a rematch with Tom Johnson at Wrotham, Kent. On 17 January 1791 Bryan and Johnson fought, the latter being 7&#150;4 on favourite. However, Bryan won a very fierce battle in twenty-one minutes, partly through luck since Johnson &#145;broke the metacarpal bone of his middle finger by striking the rail of the stage&#146;, but also due to his ability, especially &#145;his straight and severe right hand deliveries&#146;  (Miles, 69, 65). Despite the severity of the bout, a few days later Bryan displayed great agility in sparring matches at the Grecian Theatre in London's Strand, as noted in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> (22 January 1790). Such regular displays, coupled with his role as a second to other fighters, provided Ben with a living between 1790 and 1794. However, on 24 February 1794 he came out of retirement and agreed to fight William Wood. Unfortunately, the battle did not take place because Bryan fell ill, dying at his house in Gray's Inn Road on 8 April 1794. Many &#145;supposed at the time that his death happened in consequence of some inward bruise which he got in one of the many desperate battles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, 4, 1794, 45). As it was, when Bryan's body was opened they discovered that he was suffering from a &#145;scirrhous liver&#146;  (Miles, 69). On 11 April he was buried at St Sepulchre's churchyard in Snow Hill, London. Among his mourners were Johnson, Wood, and two other prize-fighters, Bill Warr and John Symonds. These pugilists composed the following epistle that appeared on his tombstone:<blockquote>
<div>Farewell, the honours of my brow<br>
</div>
<div>Victorious wreaths, farewell!<br>
</div>
<div>one blow from death has laid me low,<br>
</div>
<div>By whom such brave ones fall<br>
</div>
<div>Yet bravely I'll dispute the prize,<br>
</div>
<div>Nor yield, though out of breath,<br>
</div>
<div>Tis not the fall&#151;I yet shall rise,<br>
</div>
<div>And conquer even death.<br>
</div> (Miles, 70)</blockquote>
