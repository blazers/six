<span class="headword">Denny, Sir  Anthony</span>  (1501&#150;1549), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 16 January 1501 at Cheshunt, the second son of Sir Edmund Denny (<i>d</i>. 1520), a Hertfordshire landowner who became a baron of the exchequer in the early years of Henry VIII, and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1507), daughter of Robert Troutbeck of Bridge Trafford, Cheshire. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he does not seem to have graduated. He began his public career in the service of Sir Francis Bryan, a favourite of the king, on diplomatic missions to France, and in the late 1520s found a modest informal employment in the royal household. His formal connection with the privy chamber can be traced as early as May 1533; an indenture of 28 May 1536 identified him as &#145;of the privy chamber&#146;, and a grant of 9 September described him as groom. He became a yeoman of the wardrobe in 1536 and was entrusted with the privy purse informally in the same year. He is recorded as gentleman of the privy chamber about the beginning of 1539, when he replaced Bryan as the second chief gentleman, and as deputy groom of the stool. A client of Thomas Cromwell's, Denny was informally entrusted with the keepership of Westminster Palace at least two years before his formal appointment on 20 September 1538. He was named keeper of the privy purse on 24 April 1542. As keeper of the privy purse Denny handled substantial amounts of royal money, making massive withdrawals from and deposits in the king's coffers. He may have represented Ipswich in the parliament of 1535&#150;6.<br>
<br>As the 1540s progressed Denny became ever closer to King Henry. He was one of the first courtiers whom Henry took into his confidence in lamenting his nuptial contract with Anne of Cleves. In 1544 he accompanied the king to Boulogne, and was knighted there on 30 September, after the city's capitulation. Denny had hitherto been junior to Sir Thomas Heneage in the privy chamber, but henceforward his influence exceeded Heneage's, especially after 20 September 1545 when Denny, along with John Gates (the husband of his sister Mary) and their assistant William Clerk, was licensed by the king to affix the royal stamp&#151;the sign manual&#151;on all documents emanating from the monarch. Occasioned by Henry's growing infirmity, this was a transfer of authority which gave great influence to the men who wielded it. Then in October 1546 Heneage retired from service and Denny replaced him as first chief gentleman and groom of the stool. Denny often exchanged gifts with the king. On new year's day 1537 Queen Jane Seymour gave him a gold brooch (presumably intended for his wife), and at the beginning of 1545 Denny presented the king with a clock designed by Hans Holbein.<br>
<br>In the context of the last months of Henry's reign it was of considerable importance that Denny was a patron of humanist letters and a firm friend to religious reformation, praised as such by men like Nicholas Wentworth and Roger Ascham. A pupil of John Colet at St Paul's, he recovered and restored the lands and buildings of Sedbergh School in Yorkshire, which belonged to his alma mater of St John's, Cambridge, and saved part of the library of Waltham Abbey from destruction. Most of his associates were humanists, committed to Erasmian pietism and the cause of learning, and Denny himself was moderate in the expression of his religious views, which never conflicted with his loyalty to and friendship with the king. His sympathy with the reformed faith did not prevent his taking notice of heretical books as a loyal government servant. Both the protestant humanist Sir John Cheke and the Catholic Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, wrote in his praise. But of Denny's own protestant allegiance there can be no doubt. In 1544 he and the king's physician, William Butts, saved Richard Turner of Canterbury, accused of &#145;free and bold preaching against popish errors&#146;  (Sil, &#145;King's men&#146;, 22), from prosecution. A friend of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and a supporter of the evangelically inclined Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, in 1546 Denny supported the archbishop's recommendations against the &#145;vain ceremonies&#146; of traditional religion, and after his death was hailed as &#145;an enemy to the Pope and his superstition&#146;  (Dowling, 63).<br>
<br>In his religious stance Denny undoubtedly had the support of his wife. <a name="cosubject_70730"></a><span class="headword">Joan Denny</span>, Lady Denny  (<em>d.</em> 1553)<span class="occ"></span>, was the daughter of Sir Philip Champernon of Modbury, Devon, and his wife, Katherine Carew. She married Anthony Denny on 9 February 1538, and with him had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63292/', "Sir Edward Denny (1547&#150;1600)")</script>, and four daughters. She herself had a position in the households of queens Anne of Cleves and Katherine Parr, while her sister-in-law Lady Berkeley was governess to Princess Elizabeth. A committed protestant, with her sister Katherine Raleigh she is reported to have protected the persecuted reformers in Devon. In the summer of 1546 Lady Denny (and by extension her husband) was one of the court protestants whom religious conservatives tried to incriminate through accusations wrung from Anne Askew, a distant relative of Joan's uncle Sir Gawain Carew; Anne would admit only that Lady Denny's servant had brought her money, and Sir Anthony survived as a leading figure among Seymour's associates at the close of the reign. It is a sign of his personal intimacy with Henry VIII that according to John Foxe it was Denny who at the very end advised the dying king &#145;to prepare himself to death &hellip; and to call upon God &hellip; for grace and mercy&#146;  (Sil, &#145;Sir Anthony Denny&#146;, 196). An executor of Henry's will, he also received a substantial bequest, quite possibly arranged by Denny himself after the king's death. During Henry's funeral procession &#145;then were set at the head and feet of the said corpse Sir Anthony Denny and Sir William Herbert, two of the chief of his privy chamber&#146;, and six months later a royal patent recognized Denny as &#145;the most intimate of Henry VIII's council and chamber&#146;  (ibid., 197&#150;8).<br>
<br>Denny's influence continued into the following reign. He was named to the privy council on 31 January 1547, and to the privy chamber as groom of the stool on 30 April. That four months later he was replaced by Sir Michael Stanhope as keeper of the privy purse and first gentleman of the privy chamber may, paradoxically, have represented promotion, the desire of Seymour, now protector and duke of Somerset, to utilize the services of a veteran for more important affairs. During the Scottish campaign of 1547 Denny was appointed by Somerset to remain with the king in London, thus acting as a surrogate for the protector. In the same year he represented Hertfordshire in parliament. In January 1549 he was one of the MPs on the parliamentary committee which examined the protector's brother, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, accused of treason, and signed the council's order for his execution. In late July he and John Gates accompanied the marquess of Northampton on his unsuccessful expedition to suppress Robert Ket's Norfolk rebellion. But he was taken ill shortly afterwards, and died at Cheshunt on 10 September 1549. He was buried in St Mary's Church there.<br>
<br>Denny's lands, which were principally concentrated in the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, and Suffolk, consisted mainly of former monastic properties, notably those of Hertford and Cheshunt priories and Waltham and St Albans abbeys. His Hertfordshire lands, which had once belonged to St Albans, covered some 20,000 acres. His revenues from his estates amounted to over &pound;700, while his income from his offices amounted to at least &pound;200. His will made provision for five sons and four daughters (and also named an illegitimate son, William). It also shows his concern for humanistic principles of education, in his instructions to his wife that she should bring up their children so that &#145;the commonwealth may find them profitable members and not burdens as idle drones be to the hive&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 2.28). His heir was his eldest son, Henry, who married Honora, daughter of William Grey, thirteenth Lord Grey of Wilton, and was the father of <a name="cosubject_7507"></a><span class="headword">Edward Denny</span>, first earl of Norwich  (1569&#150;1637)<span class="occ"></span>. Educated at Cambridge, Edward became a groom of Elizabeth's privy chamber, and in 1590 or 1591 married Mary, daughter of Thomas Cecil, first earl of Exeter, Burghley's eldest son. In 1602/3 he was high sheriff of Hertfordshire, and in that capacity welcomed James I at Royston in 1603. His demeanour so pleased the new monarch that James presented Denny with the gloves from his own hands, as an earnest of future favour. Knight of the shire for Essex in the first session of parliament of 1604, on 27 October he was made Baron Denny of Waltham. His only child was his daughter, Honora, who in 1607 married James Hay, second earl of Carlisle; the marriage was said to have been arranged by the king, while the bride was regarded as a great heiress. No doubt it is a sign of her father's wealth that in 1617 he entered into a contract to collect heriots and reliefs falling due to the crown. On 17 October 1626 Denny became first earl of Norwich. He died on 24 October 1637, and was buried at Waltham Abbey.<br>
