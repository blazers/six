<span class="headword">Dionisotti,  Carlo Roberto Emilio</span>  (1908&#150;1998), <span class="occ">Italian scholar</span>, was born on 9 June 1908 in Turin, the son of Eugenio Dionisotti (1866&#150;1955), a Turinese graduate in law, and his wife, Carla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cattaneo (1886&#150;1973), a Swiss national born and bred in Italy. Dionisotti felt a particular bond of affection with Italian-speaking Switzerland. His paternal grandfather, Carlo Dionisotti (1824&#150;1899), a magistrate and a historian, born in the nearby town of Vercelli, had studied and lived in Turin. Dionisotti, who was his namesake, was to mention his work with respect and affection; he also wrote a preface (1972) to a reprint of one of his grandfather's historical books, <span class="italic">La Vallesesia ed il comune di Romagnano-Sesia</span> (1871).<br>
<br>Dionisotti's early education was peripatetic owing to family moves during the First World War. He received his secondary education at the Istituto Sociale, Turin, a school run by the Jesuits, to whom he always remained grateful, notwithstanding his non-religious inclinations, for the good grounding in Latin he received. He read arts (<i>lettere</i>) at the University of Turin, where he graduated in 1929, and he taught Latin, history, and Italian in secondary schools in Vercelli, Turin, and, from 1941, Rome. In 1942 he married Maria Luisa (Marisa) Pinna-Pintor (who belonged to a family among whose members were a famous scholar and librarian, Fortunato Pintor, with whom Dionisotti became professionally linked when he worked for the <span class="italic">Dizionario biografico degli italiani</span>). They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1937 Dionisotti had obtained the <i>libera docenza</i> (the Italian equivalent to the German academic title of <i>Privatdozent</i>); in 1941&#150;3, as well as teaching at the Liceo Virgilio in Rome, he worked at the Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana; in 1943 he was posted to the Istituto di Studi Germanici, and in 1944, after the liberation of Rome, he became an &#145;assistant&#146; to Natalino Sapegno, who held the chair of Italian literature in Rome. In the same period he was active in journalism for the resistance with the Giustizia e Libert&agrave; movement and the Partito d'Azione. He was associated with progressive cultural initiatives including those of the Einaudi publishing firm, in which he co-operated with Cesare Pavese. An important collection of his early political writings was later published as <span class="italic">Scritti sul fascismo e sulla resistenza</span> (2008).<br>
<br>In 1947 Dionisotti was offered a post as lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford. He had three referees: Roberto Weiss, professor of Italian at University College, London, James Wardrop, assistant keeper at the Victoria and Albert Museum, who had known him for about ten years, and Ferdinando Neri, dean of the faculty of letters at Turin in 1939&#150;41 and co-supervisor with Vittorio Cian of his 1929 thesis in Turin on Bembo's <span class="italic">Rime</span>. Another letter of recommendation was sent by the eminent philosopher Benedetto Croce to the Oxford professor of Italian, Alessandro Passerin d'Entr&egrave;ves. In 1949 Dionisotti was elected to the chair of Italian at Bedford College, University of London, which he held until 1970. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1972. After his retirement he accepted frequent invitations to lecture and participate in seminars and conferences in Italy, where he was widely admired and offered numerous honours and prizes. He was a member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino, of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and of the Arcadia of Rome. He was awarded the premio Viareggio in 1989, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Calabria in 1994. He regularly returned every year to the large family home at Romagnano Sesia, Novara, the village where he was eventually buried.<br>
<br>Dionisotti is widely considered the greatest historian of Italian literature in the twentieth century. The tradition in which he takes his place is that of the &#145;historical school&#146; that developed at the end of the nineteenth century, particularly at the University of Turin, through an emphasis on erudite and philological studies, based on positivist assumptions opposed both to rhetorical bellettristic formalism and to the neo-idealist philosophy of Benedetto Croce. Dionisotti had great respect for Croce's erudition and the rich historical sense that made his works so instructive and lasting, but disapproved of the facile adoption by his followers of ready-made theoretical formulas at the expense of the concrete investigation of historical facts reliably established through competent use of palaeography, the history of printing, rules of literary and metrical conventions, and all the other disciplines that Croce's followers belittled as &#145;pseudo-sciences&#146;, even though they were the indispensable foundations and specialized tools of a serious study of literature. He was also sceptical of modern labels and trends such as &#145;structuralism&#146;, &#145;deconstruction&#146;, and all the fashionable attempts to obliterate the distinction between fact and fiction, reliable historical accounts and invented narratives, and, in a more general perspective, between what is true and what is false.<br>
<br>It was at the very time, in the late 1960s, when French structuralism and post-structuralism became dominant ideologies, and a dramatic reshaping took place in prevailing assumptions, linked to the students' movement and the events of 1968, that the perspective summed up in the title of Dionisotti's best-known book, <span class="italic">Geografia e storia della letteratura italiana</span> (1967), appeared particularly relevant.<br>
<br>Dionisotti had originally acquired his reputation among specialists as one of the most formidable experts on Italian sixteenth-century literature on the strength of his early work on Bembo, but the book that gave him popularity among the wider educated public in Italy was the felicitously titled collection of essays on the &#145;geography and history of Italian literature&#146;, published by Einaudi. The title comes from his 1949 inaugural lecture at Bedford College, London, published in <span class="italic">Italian Studies</span> (1951). This book contributed to making Dionisotti almost a symbol of the great Italians who through their chosen exile reached conclusions they might not have obtained at home. It was this view from afar and from outside that allowed Dionisotti to formulate his insights with exceptional clarity, incisiveness, and persuasiveness. The nine memorable essays included in the book had been published separately between 1946 and 1966. The second, which gives the book its title, questions the <i>linea unitaria</i>, the single, consistent thread of development traditionally imposed on Italian literature, at least since Francesco de Sanctis's splendid <span class="italic">Storia della letteratura italiana</span> (1870), and later elaborated on the basis of nationalist and fascist assumptions. Dionisotti's work stressed instead the fragmentation, the conflicts that characterized the history of Italian culture. Being a Venetian or a Neapolitan, a Milanese or a Sicilian was a crucial defining factor that should not be seen as subordinate to the overarching feature of being Italian. If anything it was the regional, or even the civic characterization that gave real substance to an otherwise too vague national label. The third essay, &#145;Chierici e laici&#146; (1960), presented a strikingly enlightening outline, such as had never been attempted before, of the history of Italian literature from the viewpoint of the distinction between clergy and laity, with a prevalence of the clerics until the end of the eighteenth century and the establishment of lay education after the French Revolution. The image of Italian literature conveyed by nineteenth- and twentieth-century historiography largely ignores the centrality of the church for Italian men of letters.<br>
<br>Dionisotti published many other important works, including <span class="italic">Gli umanisti e il volgare fra quattro e cinquecento</span> (1968), which brilliantly illuminated the importance of the newly developed interest in Greek, with its variety of literary dialects, for the discussions of the Italian <i>questione della lingua</i>; the essays on Machiavelli (1980); on Italian writers between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (<span class="italic">Appunti sui moderni</span>, 1988); and between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (<span class="italic">Ricordi della scuola italiana</span>, 1998, prepared by Dionisotti and published after his death).<br>
<br>Dionisotti died on 22 February 1998 at his home at 44 West Heath Drive, Golders Green, of chronic obstructive airways disease. He was survived by his wife, Marisa, and their three daughters, Anna Carlotta, a classicist who taught at King's College, London; Paola, a well-known actor; and Eugenia, a librarian. The resonance of his work has kept growing after his death and numerous memoirs and commemorative volumes have appeared. Particularly important is a systematic collection of his works, planned in five volumes, edited by Tania Basile, Vincenzo Fera, and Susanna Villari, <span class="italic">Scritti di storia della letteratura italiana</span>, of which the first appeared in 2008 and the second in 2009.<br>
