<span class="headword">Umfreville,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1702?, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">collector of legal manuscripts</span>, was probably baptized on 24 November 1702 at the Temple Church, London, the eldest son of Edward Umfreville (<i>d</i>. 1739), a minor exchequer official, and his wife, Mary. His family was supposedly descended from an ancient Northumbrian family which had fallen into obscurity. He may have been a grandson of Edward Umfreville (1638&#150;1691), bencher of the Middle Temple and unsuccessful claimant to the barony of Umfreville. Upon his admission to the Inner Temple in January 1723 he was described as the son of Edward Umfreville of the Inner Temple, gentleman, as was his brother William in 1734, though no record can be found of their father's admission to the inn, and the reference may simply be to his occupation of a chamber in Inner Temple Lane. The son was called to the bar in 1727, but devoted himself to historical studies and is not known to have engaged in legal practice on his own behalf. In 1741 he was living in Johnson's Court, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>It is not clear how Umfreville managed to acquire his enormous collection of legal manuscripts, though they seem mostly to have been bought at auction in his earlier days. His concentration was on paper manuscripts, which sold for a few pence or shillings a volume, and his was probably the largest collection of its kind ever made, including more than eighty volumes of unpublished law reports and readings. He was well known in antiquarian circles, and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1745, but later resigned from the society &#145;in disgust&#146; together with his friend Dr Richard Rawlinson. By 1748 he had fallen into such financial difficulties that his inn pardoned him all his &#145;amercements&#146; since call, and in 1758 he was obliged to sell a considerable part of his library, including 257 manuscripts, for the benefit of his creditors. Many of these manuscripts came into the Lansdowne collection and are now in the British Library. In 1792, after his widow's death, another 1000 law manuscripts were sold at auction, and these formed the basis of the collection of Francis Hargrave, also in the British Library. A good many other manuscripts still exist, with his &#145;E. U.&#146; ownership inscription and notes in his spidery hand, which cannot be located in the sale catalogues. Though his annotations show him to have been learned in legal history and deeply knowledgeable about legal manuscripts, Umfreville's only publication was <span class="italic">Lex coronatoria</span> (1761). This treatise on the law relating to coroners was prompted by his appointment in 1754 as a coroner for Middlesex, an office which he held until his death at Islington on 17 June 1786. In 1760 he was invited to become a bencher of the Inner Temple, but declined. Nothing is known about Umfreville's wife except that she died at Lambeth on 22 March 1791. His son and heir, Neville, was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1748.<br>
