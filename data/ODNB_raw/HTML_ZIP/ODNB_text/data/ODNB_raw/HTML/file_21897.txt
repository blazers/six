<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peploe,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1667, <em>d.</em> 1752), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester and religious controversialist</span>, the son of Podmore Peploe, was baptized at Dawley Parva in Shropshire on 29 July 1667. Following attendance at Penkridge School in Staffordshire he matriculated as a batteler of Jesus College, Oxford, on 12 May 1687, graduating BA on 12 March 1691 and proceeding MA in 1693. After he had taken holy orders, his preferment was rapid: in 1695 he was presented to the rectory of Kedleston, near Derby, and in 1700 to the vicarage of Preston in Lancashire, where he quickly established a reputation as an outspoken enemy of a largely Roman Catholic population. His first wife, Ann Browne, with whom he had a son and four daughters, died on 25 November 1705; and on 8 January 1712 he married Ann Birch, a daughter of the previous incumbent at Preston. There were no surviving children from this second marriage.<br>
<br>Peploe's patrons at Preston, the Hoghtons of Hoghton Tower, were themselves staunch Presbyterians and it was undoubtedly Peploe's low-church sympathies in religion and strident whiggism in politics that recommended him to them. Lancashire in the first half of the eighteenth century was a county of religious and political extremes, where contemporary discourse portrayed the antagonism of a predominantly Roman Catholic, nonjuring, and Jacobite gentry to a palatine establishment well leavened with protestant dissenters. Conforming Anglicans like Peploe were obliged to pick their way between such rhetorical shoals with extreme care.<br>
<br>When the Jacobite forces entered Preston in November 1715 Peploe reportedly mounted his pulpit to preach a sermon exhorting his parishioners to abjure the pretender and manifest their loyalty to the house of Brunswick. But it was less this alleged act of signal bravery than his well-publicized sermons against the dangers of popery and efforts on behalf of the forfeited estates commission that brought him to the attention of ministers. On 1 July 1717 he was nominated to the vacant wardenship of Manchester collegiate church; he was, however, subsequently refused induction by his diocesan, Francis Gastrell, on the grounds that the degree of bachelor of divinity conferred upon him by faculty at Lambeth was not a valid qualification. Years of litigation, pamphleteering, and personal enmity ensued, culminating in a determination in king's bench that, for such purposes at least, degrees conferred by the archbishop of Canterbury were of equal value to those granted by the universities.<br>
<br>When Bishop Gastrell died in 1725 the question of his successor at Chester was hotly disputed, with rival church dignitaries each pressing the merits of their clients upon the ministry. Peploe was almost certainly the candidate of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, but he was assured by the duke of Newcastle that his advancement came as reward for his &#145;zeal and affection to the true interest of our king and country&#146;  (duke of Newcastle to S. Peploe, 15 Jan 1726, TNA: PRO, SP 35/61, fol. 15). He was consecrated on 12 April 1726 and, though obliged to resign his benefice at Preston, was permitted to retain the wardenship at Manchester <i>in commendam</i>. Contention there, however, continued unabated, with bitter wrangles over the visitorship and appointment of a chaplain. Indeed in the absence of any county-wide election contests in Lancashire after 1722, Manchester College came to constitute a ritual forum in which local partisans could carry on their ideological battles by subtler means.<br>
<br>At first Peploe's situation at Chester was little better, with an episcopal bureaucracy appointed by his predecessors and his cathedral firmly under the control of a tory chapter. Over the course of the next twelve years, though, the new bishop worked diligently to build up the whig interest in his diocese, supplying men of proven whig loyalties to vacant benefices in his gift and using his credit with the government to make like-minded appointments to the chapter. By such methods was the tories' stranglehold on diocesan machinery eroded and eventually broken down: in 1738 Peploe resigned his wardenship at Manchester in favour of his son Samuel (1699&#150;1781), and in the following year he saw a whig majority at last established in his cathedral.<br>
<br>From his earliest days at Preston, Peploe had identified himself with contemporary movements for the reformation of manners and the establishment of charity schools. He was a co-founder of the town's blue coat school in 1702 and of Cadley School five years later. Such institutions, he would assert in 1730, &#145;shewed the ways of piety, peace and temperance&#146;  (S. Peploe, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd in the Parish Church of St Sepulchre, April the 2d 1730</span>, 1730, 20), made the rich mindful of their Christian obligations to the poor, and served as a bulwark against the moral depravity of society. Although frequently at odds with Anglican zealots, Peploe was nevertheless an assiduous defender of the church against its enemies. He understood the extent of popular prejudice against the clergy and strove to overcome it. &#145;They have represented us as Useless and Burdensome, as Idle and Superficial in our ministerial Performances,&#146; he wrote in a charge to his diocesan clergy on the occasion of a visitation in 1747; &#145;which, however true it may be in regard to some particular Persons &hellip; yet surely, it is an unjust Imputation on the Body of the Clergy&#146;  (Green, &#145;Charity, morality, and social control&#146;, 21). During his episcopate he consecrated thirty-nine churches and chapels, largely with the aim of counteracting the influence of Roman Catholicism, and erected two new galleries in the choir of his cathedral; he was normally resident in his bishopric whenever parliament was not in session; and in general he carried out the pastoral duties of his episcopal office, including visitations and confirmations, with greater fervour and conscientiousness than was common among Hanoverian prelates.<br>
<br>A pugnacious temperament led Peploe into conflict with a succession of locally prominent figures and ensured that he would be remembered primarily as a protagonist in partisan causes. Perhaps his defining characteristic, though, was a virulent anti-Catholicism which, growing out of circumstances in his diocese, informed his theology as well as his politics. When the Jacobites threatened once more in 1745, he subscribed &pound;200 towards local defences and delivered a sermon against &#145;Popish idolatry&#146; in his cathedral. After years of failing health, which denied him translation to the see of Bath and Wells, he died on 21 February 1752; he was survived by his second wife. Peploe was buried in Chester Cathedral on 28 February.<br>
