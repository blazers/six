<span class="headword">Herne <span class="st"> [Heron]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1593&#150;1649), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was the younger son of Richard Herne (<i>d</i>. 1625), alderman, and later sheriff, of London and his wife, Alice, daughter of John Paske. He was subsequently adopted by William Robson, salter of London. He was probably the John Heron who matriculated from Clare College, Cambridge, during Lent 1608. From Cambridge he entered Lincoln's Inn on 27 January 1611, receiving his call to the bar in 1618. On 4 August of that year he married, at St Bartholomew by the Exchange, Susanna (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1600&#150;1660), daughter of John Woodward, grocer of London. On 5 March 1628 he was elected to parliament for Newport, Cornwall, but was unseated on petition.<br>
<br>During the ensuing two decades Herne assumed a prominent role in a series of important state trials, the most dramatic of which were the proceedings in the Long Parliament in the years 1641&#150;5 against William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury (1633&#150;45), on charges of high treason and misdemeanour. In 1632 he defended the barrister Henry Sherfield, recorder of Salisbury, on a charge in Star Chamber for defacing an offending stained-glass window in St Edmund's Church, Salisbury. In February 1634 he served as counsel for William Prynne, the outspoken barrister of Lincoln's Inn, during his Star Chamber trial for the publication of his controversial work against female players, <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span>. During the following year Herne is known to have held the manor of Hendon, Middlesex, paying rent on 32 acres with outbuildings and adjacent land. He became a bencher of his inn in 1637 and in 1640 he was residing in Aldersgate ward, London. In 1641 he acted as one of the counsel for the ship money judges, Sir John Bramston the elder and Sir Robert Berkeley, during proceedings against them in the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>Herne was one of Archbishop William Laud's original choices for counsel at his impeachment, being named in the prelate's petition of 1 March 1641. Ultimately he shared the archbishop's defence with the Long Parliament's appointee as co-counsel, Sir Matthew Hale. He may also have been the Mr Herne who appeared in defence of the impeached lord mayor Sir Richard Gurney in July 1642. On 11 October 1644 Herne delivered to the House of Lords an argument in law, probably a joint composition with Hale, in which he denied the existence of &#145;constructive treasons&#146; under the English law as set out in Edward III's statute of treasons (1352). Moreover, Herne's argument recognized that Laud's aggrandizement of the forensic and legislative jurisdictions of the clerical estate during his tenure as archbishop of Canterbury constituted at best a mere <i>praemunire</i>. The charges that Laud had &#145;subverted the fundamental laws of the land&#146; in maintaining his jurisdiction over and above that of the king closely resembled in substance and language those against Wolsey and Lingham during Henry VIII's reign and rested on the conflation of high treason with the lesser, non-capital cause of <i>praemunire</i>. On 6 November 1644 Herne visited Laud in the Tower and returned his prayer book that William Prynne had possessed since the Long Parliament's seizure of the prelate's papers in May 1643.<br>
<br>His precise religious convictions are not known but a provision of his will asking that Archbishop Ussher preach his funeral sermon suggests certain episcopal sympathies. Herne died in London in 1649 leaving properties worth &pound;300 per annum but complained that a suretyship for an improvident brother had left him with little to distribute among his heirs.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_13086"></a><span class="headword">John Herne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1636&#150;1660)<span class="occ"></span>, probably the elder Herne's son, entered Lincoln's Inn on 11 February 1636. He appears to have been the translator from law French of <span class="italic">The learned reading of John Herne esq., late of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, upon the statute of 23 H. 8, cap. 3, concerning commissions of sewers</span> (1659). He also published a collection of precedents called <span class="italic">The Pleader</span> (1657); <span class="italic">The Law of Conveyances</span> (8 vols., 1658); <span class="italic">The Modern Assurancer</span> (1658); and <span class="italic">The Law of Charitable Uses</span> (8 vols., 1660).<br>
