</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobson,  John</span>  (1787&#150;1865), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 9 December 1787 at The Pineapple inn, Chirton, North Shields, Northumberland, the only son of John Dobson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1827), a native of Stamfordham in Northumberland, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1828). His father combined innkeeping with a substantial business as a market and landscape gardener, and his extensive fruit gardens at Chirton were ornamentally laid out with walks and arbours for the enjoyment of fashionable visitors.<br>
<br>Dobson was the most eminent architect to be born and have worked in the north-east of England. He produced over 400 works of virtually every building type, most of them in Northumberland and co. Durham, some in Yorkshire and Cumberland, and a few further afield. He is especially linked with the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he practised for over fifty years and designed many public buildings; the majority of these have been demolished, but many of his numerous villas and country houses in the region survive. Perhaps most highly regarded as a classicist, Dobson was also, like most leading architects of his period, a highly competent exponent of what he regarded as the adaptable and picturesque Tudor Gothic style, and in the ecclesiastical field was a pioneer of the Gothic revival in the north-east. He also undertook a great deal of restoration work.<h2>
<a name="Earlytrainingandstudies"></a>Early training and studies</h2>Dobson's precocious talent for design led to occasional employment while still in his early teens as draughtsman to Mr J. McGlashan, a damask and linen weaver in the neighbouring village of Preston, and later to other local businesses. Although he had evidently been intended to follow his father's main profession, about 1802 he was allowed to begin artistic studies in Newcastle under Boniface Muss, an Italian &eacute;migr&eacute; (the painter John Martin was a fellow pupil), and then to be instructed in architectural and mechanical drawing, and surveying, by Mr Hall of Stamfordham, bridge surveyor for Northumberland. About 1804 Dobson further confirmed his commitment to the architectural profession by entering into an apprenticeship, perhaps with Hall's recommendation, with David Stephenson of Newcastle, shortly to be appointed architect to the duke of Northumberland and at that time the leading practitioner in the north-east.<br>
<br>After completing his clerkship with Stephenson in 1809 Dobson travelled to London, where he studied watercolour painting with John Varley, presumably in order to acquire the necessary facility in producing the kind of colour perspective with which architects were then presenting their designs. He had probably already met Varley during the latter's sketching and teaching tour of the north-east a year before, and Varley's painting <span class="italic">Dobson's Dream</span>, a landscape with buildings, wood, and water, appears to be the product of Dobson's early morning lessons; further evidence that their relationship matured into friendship is provided by another watercolour by Varley, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, inscribed with Dobson's name. Other valuable friendships were with the painters W. H. Hunt, Mulready (both also studied under Varley), Turner, West, and, significantly, Robert Smirke. Smirke's architect sons Robert and Sydney were also important to Dobson; Robert Smirke the elder was one of the leading exponents of the newly fashionable Greek revival style, while Sydney was later to become his son-in-law. Indeed, useful though Varley's instruction was, it was the opportunity to become immersed in the London architectural scene that was crucial to Dobson's development and Sir John Soane, then commencing his Royal Academy lectures on architecture, may have been a further indirect influence. Contrary to the advice of his London friends, Dobson returned to the north-east in 1810. He set up practice in North Shields and soon afterwards in Newcastle, where he immediately introduced a more authentic Greek revival neo-classicism with his first building, the Royal Jubilee School in City Road (1810; dem.); this, however, had to be built with pilasters instead of the intended portico.<h2>
<a name="Establishmentofindependentpracticeandmarriage"></a>Establishment of independent practice and marriage</h2>From the outset Dobson insisted on his status as a professional architect in the modern sense. Following the precepts of Soane, he was careful to distance himself from the earlier generation of builder&#150;architects in Newcastle and elsewhere, including Stephenson, and was at first a comparatively isolated figure who, in spite of some early commissions, had to work hard to create a demand for his services. In the intervals between employment he undertook study tours of England, Wales, and France, which reinforced his growing interest in medieval architecture, although unlike many of his contemporaries he never visited Italy or Greece. By 1815, however, Dobson was becoming involved in planning several residential developments in Newcastle and was able to take on as a pupil Thomas Oliver (who worked for him until 1821). He also had the beginnings of a useful villa and country house practice for the local gentry, designing, for example, the neo-classical Prestwick Lodge (1815), Doxford Hall (1817&#150;18), both in Northumberland, and the Villa Reale, Newcastle (1817); at about this time he also produced, for Sir Jacob Astley, an elaborate though unexecuted scheme for the enlargement of Seaton Delaval Hall.<br>
<br>In the mid-1820s Dobson married Isabella (1794&#150;1846), daughter of Alexander Rutherford, a master mariner, and his wife, Isabella, of Gateshead. His wife was a talented amateur artist. Of their eight children (three sons and five daughters) the two eldest sons and two eldest daughters survived to adulthood. Isabella married the architect Sydney Smirke; Margaret Jane (1830&#150;1905) is best known for her useful, if not entirely reliable, biography of her father, published in 1885. The Dobsons' second son, Alexander Ralph (<i>b</i>. 1828), showed considerable architectural talent, working for his father before and after a pupillage (1849&#150;52) with Sydney Smirke, and being elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1850. He was clearly intended to take over the practice, but was killed in the Newcastle quayside fire of 1854. After this his elder brother John (<i>b</i>. 1827) was employed, but probably only in an administrative capacity since he had begun his career as a master mariner; possible hopes of an architectural dynasty were not to be.<h2>
<a name="Majorcommissionsdomesticandpublic"></a>Major commissions: domestic and public</h2>Major country house designs in Northumberland, both for established county families and for industrialists setting up as landed proprietors, followed during the next two decades. Mitford Hall (begun 1823), Longhirst Hall (1824&#150;5), and Meldon Park (1832), beautifully sited and built with superb ashlar masonry, were influenced by two recent examples of Greek revival architecture in the county, namely Belsay Hall (1807&#150;17), where its Graecophil owner, Sir Charles Monck, was his own architect, and John Shaw's Cresswell Hall (1821&#150;4; dem. 1938). From the latter Dobson derived what became on both aesthetic and functional grounds his preferred country house and villa plan: L-shaped, having the principal rooms on the south (sometimes with a bay) and east, the entrance to the west, and a service wing running north, often linked at right-angles to a conservatory on the eastern side. This plan was also used in some of his Tudor Gothic houses, such as Lilburn Tower, near Wooler, Northumberland (1828&#150;9). However, a later work in the same style, Beaufront Castle, near Hexham, also in Northumberland (1837&#150;41), incorporating an earlier house, is a looser, more picturesque design.<br>
<br>Dobson also undertook a small amount of landscape gardening. His work for Ralph Riddell at Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland, of <i>c</i>.1813 included not only the Tudor Gothic reconstruction of the house itself but also a scheme (partially implemented) for replanning the park, with ha-ha, serpentine paths, a &#145;primitive&#146; cottage set deep in trees, and irregular areas of woodland coming right up to the house, reminiscent of Repton's picturesque style. His most important landscape commission was probably that for the Hon. W. H. Beresford at Bolam Hall, Northumberland, where in 1816 he laid out extensive areas of carefully variegated woodland and a substantial artificial lake. Dobson also revived, again in the manner of Repton, the use of formal elements such as borders, paths, and lawns in the immediate vicinity of a house. Meldon, in its elevated position with terrace overlooking and shading into the surrounding landscape, is a good example of this.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in Newcastle, Dobson had become sufficiently established and well connected to win the competition for the design of the gaol and house of correction in Carliol Square (1822&#150;8; dem. <i>c</i>.1929), which he planned according to the radiating principle (a year earlier he also designed the rather similar Northumberland county gaol at Morpeth, of which the gigantic, castellated gatehouse still survives). In 1827 he won a limited competition to build for the Newcastle corporation his first major church, that of St Thomas the Martyr, Barras Bridge, then on the northern extremity of the town and replacing a medieval chapel of the same name demolished in order to widen the entrance from the old Tyne Bridge. It is a typically late Georgian lancet-style design (completed 1830) without chancel, reminiscent of the &#145;commissioners' Gothic&#146; of that time; its interior, however, is particularly spacious and elegant, having slender columns and vaulted roof, although slightly marred by the later insertion of galleries.<br>
<br>Also in Newcastle, for the speculative builder Richard Grainger, Dobson laid out Blackett Street (1824; subsequently almost entirely redeveloped), Eldon Square (1825&#150;31; largely dem., somewhat controversially, <i>c</i>.1972), and the Royal Arcade (1831&#150;2; dem. 1963&#150;9), all of which reinforced the air of fashionable elegance Grainger was bringing to the town. But Dobson's plan for the redevelopment of Newcastle of <i>c</i>.1824, involving the construction of a classical square and &#145;civic palace&#146; on the site of the historic manor of Anderson Place (which, curiously, still occupied an almost vacant central site), was superseded by the more pragmatic, commercially viable scheme evolved by Grainger himself. This was largely carried out between 1834 and 1839, Dobson being responsible at this time only for the design of the &#145;Grainger&#146; market and the lower east side of Grey Street. Another of Dobson's planning schemes which unfortunately remained largely unexecuted, although actually begun in 1828, was that for a new town at Seaham, co. Durham; this had been intended by the third marquess of Londonderry to complement the harbour he was building for the export of coal, but the original classical layout was soon abandoned because of financial constraints.<br>
<br>Later, in Newcastle, Dobson added a substantial new wing to the old infirmary in the Forth (1852&#150;5; dem. 1954) and in 1854 drew up plans for the rebuilding of the quayside, which had been devastated by a fire caused by an explosion over the river in Gateshead in October of that year; these were partially implemented a few years later, but with street elevations by different architects. Dobson's scheme, illustrated in a drawing in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, proposed a series of picturesque frontages in the more eclectic manner of his later years. His greatest public building was the Central Station, Newcastle, designed 1847&#150;8 and opened by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on 29 August 1850, albeit in an unfinished state. It has a fine, curving train shed of iron and glass, a model of which was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and which won Dobson an honourable mention, and a fa&ccedil;ade in the grand style of Vanbrugh, even in the altered and reduced form in which it was finally completed in 1863. Much of the last five years of Dobson's career was taken up with the remarkable feat of underpinning and reconstructing Lambton Castle, co. Durham, an enormous building dating mainly from the early nineteenth century which was threatened with serious mining subsidence; his extensive additions to the house, begun in 1857 and completed after 1862 by Sydney Smirke, are, however, now largely demolished.<h2>
<a name="Churchcommissions"></a>Church commissions</h2>Dobson also built up a substantial ecclesiastical practice, for all denominations, especially in the second half of his career, although this aspect of his work has been less admired in the twentieth century. However, it should be noted that in this context many of his designs were built to a limited budget in the growing urban and industrial areas of the north-east and as such had to be fairly plain and functional. Most of his churches after about 1825 are in the Gothic revival style, for which he had become an enthusiast and in which he steadily developed, under the influence of Pugin and the Ecclesiologists, a more archaeologically and liturgically &#145;correct&#146; approach (also adopted in his restoration work). This can be seen in such late works as St John's, Otterburn, Northumberland (1855&#150;7), a rather delicate Decorated design, and Jesmond parish church, Newcastle (1858&#150;61). His occasional excursions into the briefly fashionable neo-Norman style are exemplified by St James's, Benwell, Newcastle (1831&#150;2; subsequently much altered and enlarged), and St Cuthbert's, Bensham, co. Durham (1845&#150;8; north aisle added 1875).<br>
<br>By the 1850s and 1860s the spread of Ruskinian ideas meant that Dobson's rather thoroughgoing church restorations, admittedly usually encouraged if not demanded by incumbent clergymen, were becoming increasingly controversial. Nowhere was this more evident than at Hexham Abbey, Northumberland, where between 1858 and 1860 he replaced most of the late Gothic east end, including the Perpendicular lady chapel, with a rather over-academic lancet design based on that of Whitby Abbey, which he deemed to be contemporary with the building's basic form. Yet Dobson was also capable of sensitively reconstructing (for the duke of Northumberland) the Percy chapel at the east end of Tynemouth Priory, Northumberland, a highly decorative example of Perpendicular work; that this was no routine task is indicated by the fact that in the same year (1852) he gave a scholarly paper on the subject to a meeting in Newcastle of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, illustrated with large-scale drawings of the elaborately carved heraldic bosses of the chapel's roof.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Dobson was elected FRIBA on 28 June 1845, proposed by W. Burn, T. L. Donaldson, A. Salvin, and S. Smirke, and was president of the newly formed Northern Architectural Association from 1859. His practice, possibly one of the last great provincial ones, was substantial, with clerks, draughtsmen, and pupils. Among his later assistants were Johnson Hogg; Gibson Kyle; George Ridley, later chief clerk to Sydney Smirke; E. R. Robson, a nationally known school board architect; and Thomas Prosser, who as architect to the North Eastern Railway Company completed the Newcastle Central Station after Dobson's career was terminated by an incapacitating stroke in 1862. Thomas Austin completed some of Dobson's works and, in partnership with his fellow Gothic revivalist R. J. Johnson, purchased his practice after his death. Dobson himself was a fine draughtsman but large numbers of his drawings&#151;and office records&#151;have disappeared. Of the drawings and watercolours that do survive, the largest collection is in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne; a few other drawings are to be found in, for example, the RIBA drawings collection, London, and in the libraries of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of the University of Newcastle.<br>
<br>Dobson was of middle height, with dark hair. A bust of him is reproduced in his daughter's <span class="italic">Memoir of John Dobson</span> (1885). There are also two portraits of Dobson in the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, one painted by J. Dixon (<i>c</i>.1820), in which the architect is seated at a desk, and the other, unattributed, showing him in late middle age. Of these the former is by far the better likeness. Although dedicated, determined, and industrious, and robust and vigorous in physique&#151;he enjoyed boxing and fencing in his youth&#151;Dobson had &#145;the fastidiousness of a retiring nature&#146;  (Dobson, 65) and may have lacked the ultimate degree of ambition necessary to promote himself fully; hence, possibly, his decision to set up in Newcastle rather than the metropolis. He published no treatises, although his &#145;Presidential address to the Northern Architectural Association&#146; of 1859  (repr. in Wilkes, 99&#150;110) does give some account of his career and approach. Nor did he enter any of the great national architectural competitions or, except on rare occasions, exhibit his work nationally.<br>
<br>Dobson achieved a remarkable level of professional integrity and competence throughout his long career. He was noted for his technical and constructional expertise, and unusual sensitivity in the siting of his designs. He was not a stylistic innovator and avoided doctrinaire commitment to any single mode. However, his architecture almost invariably has a distinctive solidity and strength; this found its most appropriate expression in the Greek revival and neo-classical styles. After Dobson's enforced retirement through ill health he moved to Ryton, co. Durham, but returned to his Newcastle home at 15 New Bridge Street shortly before his death there on 8 January 1865. Dobson was buried in Jesmond cemetery, which he himself had laid out thirty years before and of which the monumental chapels and gates are among his finest works.<br>
