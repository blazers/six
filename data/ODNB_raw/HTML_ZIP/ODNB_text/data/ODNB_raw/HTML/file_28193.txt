<span class="headword">Venning,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1858), <span class="occ">prison reformer and philanthropist</span>, was born at Totnes, Devon, on 20 May 1776, the son of Walter Venning, a merchant, and Mary Ann, his wife. He attended Totnes grammar school and, at the age of fourteen, followed his elder brother William to work for Jackson &amp; Co., a London banking house with interests in Russia. In 1793 he was sent to St Petersburg by the firm; six years later he was joined there by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28195/', "Walter Venning (1781&#150;1821)")</script>. John Venning married Julia, the daughter of James Meybohm, a wealthy member of the large German merchant community in St Petersburg, on 13 September 1805.<br>
<br>Venning rapidly established himself in the expatriate merchant community in St Petersburg, meeting Tsar Alexander I in 1808 and becoming a familiar figure in polite Russian society. In 1807 Walter Venning returned to England; he came back to Russia in 1817 a committed evangelical and prison reformer. Shortly after, John Venning himself was converted, and he abandoned his social life of theatres and balls. Like other evangelicals, he cultivated an intense personal devotion to Christ, holding that all were sinners saved only through Christ's redemption. Committed to active charitable intervention for the salvation of all God's children, he took Walter's cue in embracing the work of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, which had been established in England in 1815. This society modelled its work on that of John Howard (1726&#150;1790), the prison reformer, and campaigned for regulated prisons which provided education and instruction in the Christian faith, and reformed rather than brutalized prisoners. John Venning committed himself to reforming Russian prisons and to forwarding the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society, which had set up a Russian Bible Society in 1813, aiming to make vernacular <span class="roman">Bibles</span> available to every family in the empire. This agenda brought him close to Alexander I, whose mystical and ultra-conservative Christian spirituality had also led the tsar to an involvement with English Quakers, Methodists, and Baptists, as well as German Lutheran pietists. The tsar aimed to create a transformed society, impermeable to revolution and based on the word of God, education, and philanthropy.<br>
<br>Alexander was a frequent visitor to the Venning brothers, who in 1819 set up a Prison Discipline Society in St Petersburg. After Walter's death in 1821, John continued their work, revealing to the tsar the appalling conditions in Russian prisons. Emphasizing their extreme filth, the abuse of women, the lack of any medical or spiritual care, and the prevalence of disease, corruption, vice, overcrowding, and misery, Venning presented the prisons as hell come to earth. He was particularly horrified by the condition of the so-called &#145;exiles&#146; sent to Siberian mines in chain-gangs. Venning reported directly to Alexander through Prince Galitzin and pressed for Howardian reforms, including the introduction of such health measures as exercise and basic hygiene, and the suppression of vices such as gambling, alcoholism, and promiscuity. He also suggested the adoption of work programmes in shoemaking, tailoring, and other trades, and, above all, he called for religious conversion based on distribution of <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and <span class="roman">Bible</span> teaching. Venning believed that crime stemmed from universal sinfulness: Satan's power flourishing in foul neglected neighbourhoods, fuelled by extravagance, addiction, and atheistic sedition. At the heart of his message was the imperative of trust in God and redemption through Christ.<br>
<br>Venning was given unlimited access to the prisons of Russia and carefully cultivated the support of leading Russians: indeed, during this period it was <i>de rigueur</i> for aspiring Russians to be seen to be engaged in philanthropic ventures. In 1821 he visited England and went to Newgate Prison with Elizabeth Fry, also getting to know the rest of the Gurney, Fry, and Hoare Quaker banking interests with whom Walter had worked closely. During this trip he established a Prison Discipline Society in Prussia and visited prisons in France before returning to St Petersburg in 1822.<br>
<br>Administration was very poor in Russia, and Venning frequently found the orders of the tsar were ignored because they had not been transmitted down. Moreover, he was often abused and menaced by officials whose profits and pleasures were threatened by reform; charges of peculation were trumped up against him in 1828 and dismissed without trial. Gradually the reforms which he sought began to be introduced in the great cities. However, by the mid-1820s Alexander's belief in philanthropic Western methods of securing reform was being undermined by the Russian Orthodox church and other deeply reactionary forces in Russia, which saw them as harbingers of foreign influence and liberalism. Obscurantist policies had already set in when Alexander I died in late 1825 and although his successor, Nicholas I, agreed to be patron of the St Petersburg Prison Discipline Society, he drastically reduced the field of activity of the Russian Bible Society. In May 1830 Venning and his wife returned to England and on medical advice remained there. His work of prison reform and <span class="roman">Bible</span> distribution was continued in Russia by the German doctor Frederich Haas of Moscow.<br>
<br>Venning also worked to secure the release of debtors from Russian prisons, but his philanthropy was wider than <span class="roman">Bible</span> distribution and prison reform. In November 1824, for example, he played a major role in setting up two houses of refuge after the terrible St Petersburg flood, and he secured funding from the imperial family to replace these with a permanent house with a hospital and work programme. In 1828 Venning persuaded the dowager empress to grant &pound;40,000 to set up an enlightened lunatic asylum 5 miles from St Petersburg. Here he worked as governor to establish a regime based on the moral management system pioneered at The Retreat in York, and centred on the dignified treatment of inmates, exercise, kindness, good food, prayer, and scriptural instruction. In addition he and Walter were part of a committee which established two Lancaster schools, triggered by the visit to Alexander I of the Quakers William Allen and Stephen Grellet in 1818. The schools were paid for by the imperial family and other benefactors; one operated for poor Russian boys, the other for poor expatriate children. The one for Russians suffered from the government reaction against Lancaster schools in the mid-1820s, although it had been founded specifically to teach scripture, in direct challenge to Russian schools which, to the alarm of the authorities, were teaching French liberal philosophy.<br>
<br>On their return to England the Vennings settled at Surrey House, Surrey Street, Norwich (near the Gurneys of Earlham), and John became a significant figure in the Norwich City Mission. Although actual denomination meant far less to Venning than a vital personal relationship with Christ, he and his wife were Congregationalists, attending a church in Prince's Street, Norwich, from 1831 to 1858. After suffering acute abdominal pains for some time, he died at his home on 11 April 1858, leaving his wife and a son and daughter. John Venning was remembered as a kindly, hospitable, and cheerful man, warm-hearted in his beliefs, who had acted out his gratitude for and delight in Christ's redemption of the world in a strange and at times savage environment of autocratic policy making, immense human suffering, and intense distrust from Europhobic elements of the Russian state.<br>
