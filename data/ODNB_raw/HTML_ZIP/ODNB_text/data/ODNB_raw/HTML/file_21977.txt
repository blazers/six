<span class="headword">Perrers <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Windsor]</span>,  Alice</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400/01), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was probably the daughter of Sir Richard Perrers of Hertfordshire, who was imprisoned in 1350 and outlawed in 1359 following a land dispute with the abbey of St Albans&#151;a fact which may explain the extreme hostility towards her of Thomas Walsingham, the St Albans chronicler, who claimed that she was the daughter of a thatcher, and that she had no physical beauty, but gained her hold over the king through sorcery and the blandishments of her tongue. It has also been claimed that her father was a Devon weaver. Having served for some time as lady in waiting in the household of Queen Philippa (<i>d</i>. 1369), Alice seems to have become <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III's")</script> mistress around 1364: their son John was of age to be married in January 1377, and to accompany the earl of Cambridge on his Portuguese campaign of 1381&#150;2. It was also in 1364 that the merchant and courtier Richard Lyons (<i>d</i>. 1381), later to become her friend, was ordered not to interfere with Alice's going where she wished on the king's business or her own.<br>
<br>It was not until after the queen's death, however, that her relationship with Edward III became public. During the last decade of the king's life Alice received numerous favours from the king in the form of wardships and marriages, grants of land, and jewels. In 1371 she was permitted to buy the royal manor of Wendover for &pound;500, and in 1373 was given a selection of Queen Philippa's jewels. She also exploited her position to the full, accepting gifts from courtiers and others eager to curry favour with the king, and engaging in a series of enfeoffments-to-use and other land transactions with them, in the hope of protecting her acquisitions following Edward's death. Walsingham records that the abbot of St Albans, who was engaged in a property dispute with Alice, was advised in 1374 that she &#145;had such power and eminence in those days that no-one dared to prosecute a claim against her&#146;, and thus decided to abandon his suit until circumstances were more propitious  (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 3.228).<br>
<br>In 1375 Edward held a tournament at Smithfield at which Alice was exhibited to the Londoners as the Lady of the Sun. Such disregard for conventional morality did not pass without criticism, however. Langland, in his <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>, is thought to have based his figure of Lady Meed&#151;a personification of venality&#151;on Alice, and in the Good Parliament of 1376 the speaker of the Commons, Sir Peter de la Mare, accused her of relieving the exchequer of &pound;2000 or &pound;3000 a year without profit to the realm. Walsingham added that the Dominican friar whom she employed to weave her spells over the king was apprehended at her manor of Pallenswick (Fulham) during this parliament, and brought before the king. The rolls of parliament merely record that an ordinance was passed forbidding women in general, and Alice in particular, to prosecute their quarrels in the royal courts &#145;by way of maintenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 2.329). As a result, she was told to absent herself from court and to desist from such practice in future, under pain of forfeiture and banishment from the realm.<br>
<br>During the Good Parliament it also emerged that Alice was not a single woman&#151;as the king, when so informed, claimed to believe&#151;but was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29727/', "Sir William Windsor")</script>. Windsor, a Westmorland knight, had been appointed as royal lieutenant in Ireland in 1369, but was recalled in 1373 following complaints about the harshness of his rule there. He was reappointed in 1374, only to be recalled again in 1376, once more in the face of vociferous Irish opposition. It was probably during his stay in England in 1373&#150;4 that he and Alice were married&#151;they certainly engaged in financial transactions together at this time&#151;and it may be that she had a hand in his reappointment.<br>
<br>Alice's absence from court, if it was effective at all, was not prolonged. On 22 October 1376 she received a pardon from the king, and she remained with him until his death. In January 1377 her son by the king, John Southeray, was married to Mary, half-sister of Henry, Lord Percy, and on 17 June, four days before Edward's death, the king granted him a satin coat of arms. Walsingham claimed that she sat with the king until his voice began to fail, then seized the rings from his fingers and fled. Alice's moment of truth had now arrived. In November 1377 all those who wished to sue her for offences against the king and people were encouraged to bring their petitions to parliament. John of Gaunt, the king's son, presided at her trial, where she was accused on two counts: first, that in November 1376, after the council had ordered Sir Nicholas Dagworth to go to Ireland to investigate the charges against Windsor, she persuaded the king to countermand the order on the grounds that Dagworth was an enemy of Windsor; second, that she had persuaded the king, in May 1377, to grant a full pardon and a gift of 1000 marks to Richard Lyons, who like her had been attacked in the Good Parliament. Alice maintained her innocence on both counts, but was convicted and sentenced to banishment from the realm and forfeiture of all her goods and lands, including those with which she had enfeoffed others to her use, although this last clause, on account of its enormity (for such lands were normally regarded as exempt from confiscation), was not to be adopted as a precedent, but only &#145;for such an odious thing in this special case&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.12&#150;14). On 3 December orders were issued to seize her lands. The resulting inquisitions reveal that she held properties in at least fifteen counties; it was also claimed later that following her conviction she had secretly passed jewels worth &pound;20,000 to Windsor to prevent their being seized. This may be an exaggeration, but jewels worth over &pound;3000 were certainly recovered from her after her arrest.<br>
<br>The remaining years of Alice's life were largely devoted to trying to recover as much as possible of what had been lost in 1377, a task in which she was initially aided by Windsor. He petitioned the parliament of October 1378 for a reversal of the judgment against her, and was given leave to pursue his suit. Apparently she had not left the realm, for when, following another petition from Windsor, her sentence of banishment was revoked on 14 December 1379, she was simultaneously pardoned for having remained in England, as was Windsor for having harboured her. On 15 March 1380, in return for a promise of military service to the crown, Windsor was granted some of the lands which Alice had forfeited in 1377, but the process of recovery was a slow one, and his death on 15 September 1384 brought new problems, for not only did he die in debt to the crown, but he had enfeoffed all his lands, including those which had once belonged to Alice, to a group of trustees, to be disposed of after his death according to his last wishes. Alice claimed that he had intended her to have the lands, but the trustees asserted that he had nominated his nephew, John Windsor, as his beneficiary.<br>
<br>Her struggle with John Windsor dominated the rest of Alice's life. She submitted numerous petitions to parliament, and succeeded in 1393 in having Windsor committed briefly to Newgate gaol, but he was soon released. It was to little avail: she recovered only a few small properties, such as the manor of Gaines in Upminster (Essex), where she resided during her later years. Her will reveals her enduring bitterness: dated 15 August 1400, it bequeathed all the lands which John Windsor, or others with his consent, had &#145;usurped&#146;, to her daughters, Joan and Jane, &#145;for that I say, on pain of my soul, he hath no right to these, nor never had&#146;  (Nicolas, 153). She asked to be buried in Upminster church, Essex, leaving her manor of Gaines in Upminster to her younger daughter, Joan, and her remaining lands to be divided between Jane and Joan. What became of her son, John Southeray, is not clear. In 1380 he had been divorced by Mary Percy, who claimed never to have consented to their marriage, but after the Portuguese campaign of 1381&#150;2 no more is heard of him; he probably died soon after. Since Alice's marriage to Windsor was certainly childless, the likelihood is that all three of her children were Edward III's, for there is no good evidence for the assertion that she had earlier been married to Sir Thomas Narford. Joan married Robert Skerne, a lawyer from Kingston (Surrey)&#151;their memorial brasses may still be seen in All Saints' Church there&#151;and Jane married Richard Northland. Alice died in the winter of 1400&#150;01, her will being proved on 3 February 1401.<br>
