<span class="headword">Pearsall,  Robert Lucas</span>  (1795&#150;1856), <span class="occ">composer and antiquary</span>, born at Clifton, Bristol, on 14 March 1795, was the son of Richard Pearsall, a former army officer and amateur musician, and his wife, Elizabeth Lucas, a descendant through her mother, Phillippa Still, of John Still, bishop of Bath and Wells. His mother had him privately educated with a view to a legal career. She also encouraged his musical talent; a cantata, <span class="italic">Saul and the Witch of Endor</span>, which he composed at about the age of thirteen, was privately published.<br>
<br>On 23 August 1817 Pearsall married Marie Henriette (or Harriet) Elizabeth Hobday, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13401/', "William Armfield Hobday")</script> and Elizabeth Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ivory; they had at least one son and two daughters. Pearsall was called to the bar in 1821, having kept terms at Lincoln's Inn, and was active as a barrister on the western circuit for four years, during which time he contributed regularly to a number of periodicals, including <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. In 1825, however, he went abroad, ostensibly for the sake of his health, and pursued his passions for music, history, heraldry, and genealogy. His earliest extant compositions date from this period: a minuet and trio in B[flat] is dated 14 July 1825 at Willsbridge House, the family's seat near Bristol. At about the same time the well-known &#145;Duetto for [Two Cats]&#146; (the last two words are represented on the title-page of the first edition by a drawing of two cats), which has sometimes been attributed to Rossini, was published by Ewer and Johanning under the pseudonym G. Berthold; the piece exists in Pearsall's autograph, and Edgar Hunt has persuasively argued that he was the composer of the work. For four years Pearsall studied music with Joseph Panny in Mainz, where he became interested in the Cecilian movement and composed a number of Latin motets in the &#145;strict style&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1829 Pearsall revisited Willsbridge, leaving his family in Germany, but returned to the continent the following year and, for the sake of his children's education, settled in Karlsruhe, which remained his principal residence for the next twelve years. During this time, however, he travelled widely, pursuing his antiquarian and musical interests. In Munich in 1832 he met Caspar Ett (1788&#150;1847), from whom he learned to transcribe early musical notation; in Vienna he formed a lasting friendship with the musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter (1773&#150;1850); and in Nuremberg he investigated a mode of torture known as &#145;the kiss of the virgin&#146;, which he described in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 27 (1838), 229&#150;50. In these years he wrote a number of works with orchestra, including <span class="italic">Die Nacht eines Schw&auml;rmers</span> (1834), a &#145;ballet with songs&#146;, which was performed in the theatre he had built at his Karlsruhe residence, and the overture <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, with witches' chorus (1839).<br>
<br>On the death of his mother in May 1836 Pearsall returned to England, where he remained until he sold Willsbridge a year later. In January 1837 he was a founder member of the Bristol Madrigal Society, by which many of his early madrigals, based on Thomas Morley's ballets, were performed. The success of these pieces encouraged him to write further madrigals and partsongs, some for many voices. &#145;The Hardy Norseman&#146; and &#145;Sir Patrick Spens&#146;, in ten parts, and the eight-part settings of &#145;Great God of love&#146; and &#145;Lay a garland on her hearse&#146; were considered to be &#145;amongst the finest specimens of English part-writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His arrangement of the old melody <span class="italic">In dulci jubilo</span> (for eight solo voices and five-part chorus in his original version) is still a favourite Christmas song. It is on these compositions, though few are currently performed, that his significance as a composer principally rests; however, Pearsall himself considered his <span class="roman">Requiem</span> to be his finest work. Among his literary works at this time was a booklet, published anonymously in Karlsruhe, entitled <span class="italic">A few remarks on the position of the baronets of Great-Britain and the other branches of the British gentry, compared with that of the lesser nobility both at home and abroad, by a traveller</span>, of which a considerably enlarged version was published in London the following year. It was reissued several times. His other writings included an article in German on the origin and history of the English madrigal, which he contributed to the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Deutschlands Musik-Vereine</span> in 1842.<br>
<br>In that year Pearsall bought the castle of Wartensee on Lake Constance, Switzerland, which had previously belonged to his old teacher Schnyder von Wartensee, and at about the same time he separated from his wife. Apart from a short visit to England in 1847, he lived at Wartensee, restoring the castle and entertaining distinguished musicians, writers, and archaeologists until 1854, when he transferred ownership of the castle to his wife and son and took up residence in nearby St Gallen, Switzerland. During these years he continued to devote himself intensively to musical, literary, and artistic activities, making translations into English verse of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span> and Schiller's <span class="italic">Wilhelm Tell</span>, writing several treatises on church music which he did not publish (&#145;Observations on chanting&#146;, &#145;Musica sacra Gregoriana&#146;, &#145;Psalmodia: an essay on psalm tunes&#146;), helping to edit the old St Gallen hymnbook, which was published in 1863 as <span class="italic">Katholisches Gesangbuch zum Gebrauch bei dem &ouml;ffentlichen Gottesdienste</span>, and assisting in illustrating Hefter's <span class="italic">Geschichte der Ger&auml;thschaften des Mittelalters</span>. In 1856 he became ill and moved back to Wartensee, where his wife cared for him until he died, apparently of a stroke, on 5 August 1856. Three days before his death he was received into the Roman Catholic church by his friend the bishop of St Gallen. He was buried in the chapel of Wartensee Castle on 12 August.<br>
