<span class="headword">Lynch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Foulks]</span>,  Theodora Elizabeth</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at Dale Park, Sussex, the daughter of Arthur Foulks and his wife, Mary Ann McKenzie. Her father, of Redland House, Bristol, ran the Lodge estate sugar plantation in St Dorothy's parish (near Old Harbour, in modern St Catherine parish), Jamaica. Little is known of Theodora's early life. On 28 December 1835 she married Henry Mark Lynch at her father's plantation. Her husband was born in Kingston, Jamaica, on 29 October 1814, the second son of John Lynch of Kingston. He was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple on 31 May 1837, called to the bar on 12 June 1840, and returned to Jamaica to practise law. He was nominated to become a judge in the colony, but died of yellow fever on 15 July 1845 before taking up the post. He was buried at Halfway Tree church, St Andrew, Jamaica, on 16 July 1845.<br>
<br>Following her husband's death Theodora returned to England and began her writing career. Her first publication was a book of poetry: <span class="italic">Lays of the Sea, and other Poems</span> (1846; 2nd edn, 1850). The following year she turned to prose in <span class="italic">The Cotton-Tree, or, Emily, the Little West Indian: a Tale for Young People</span> (1847; 2nd edn, 1853; 3rd edn, 1854). She continued her prose work in <span class="italic">The Family Sepulchre: a Tale of Jamaica</span> (1848), which aimed &#145;to instruct the young mind how to meet the &#147;last enemy&#148; with true Christian fortitude and composure&#146;. Her stories were often set in the West Indies and were well laced with catechistic didacticism. Drawing on her own experiences of her youth in Jamaica, they offer intriguing insights into Jamaican society in the last years of slavery and the early years following emancipation. For example, she refers in <span class="italic">The Family Sepulchre</span> to a white child as a &#145;buckra piccaninni&#146;, African terms for &#145;white&#146; and &#145;child&#146;, respectively. She published another thirteen volumes of stories and novels, including <span class="italic">Maude Effingham: a Tale of Jamaica</span> (1849); <span class="italic">The Little Teacher</span> (2nd edn, 1851); <span class="italic">The Mountain Pastor</span> (1852; 3rd edn, 1853); <span class="italic">The Red Brick House</span> (1855); <span class="italic">The Wonders of the West Indies</span> (two editions, 1856); <span class="italic">The Story of my Girlhood</span> (1857); <span class="italic">The Exodus of the Children of Israel, and their Wanderings in the Desert</span> (1857); <span class="italic">Songs of the Evening Land, and other Poems</span> (1861); <span class="italic">Rose and her Mission, a Tale of the West Indies</span> (1863); <span class="italic">The Sabbaths of the Year, Hymns for Children</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Years Ago: a Tale of West Indian Domestic Life of the Eighteenth Century</span> (1865). Theodora Lynch died at 81 St John's Wood Terrace, London, on 27 June 1885, and was described in her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary as &#145;a poet of considerable merit&#146;.<br>
