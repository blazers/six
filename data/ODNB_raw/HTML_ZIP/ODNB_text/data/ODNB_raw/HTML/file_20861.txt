<span class="headword">Osbaldeston,  Lambert</span>  (1594&#150;1659), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was the second son of Lambert Osbaldeston, haberdasher, of London, and his wife, Martha Banks, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20863/', "William Osbaldeston")</script>. Lambert was educated at Westminster School, where he was a scholar by 1609, and he was elected to a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1612. He matriculated as the son of a gentleman on 20 October 1615, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 25 October. He graduated BA at Oxford on 13 June 1616 and proceeded MA on 27 April 1619.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1621 Osbaldeston had with John Wilson a joint patent from the dean and chapter of Westminster of the headmastership of Westminster School, which was granted to him alone on 4 December 1622. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1628. Having been promised by 13 August 1628 the next vacant canonry of Westminster, he was on 22 July 1629 presented to the tenth stall. In July 1629 he was collated by his friend Bishop John Williams (also dean of Westminster) to the prebend of Biggleswade in Lincoln Cathedral. In 1637 he was presented to the rectory of Wheathampstead, with the chapel of Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Osbaldeston's close association with Williams made him a target for those in the Westminster chapter, led by Peter Heylyn, who wanted to oust the dean. Osbaldeston was accused of charging fees in what ought to have been a &#145;free&#146; school, of being &#145;given to company, good fellowship, and muche gadding abrode&#146;, and even of pilfering cups and spoons.<br>
<br>In 1638 letters written by Osbaldeston were found in Williams's house at Buckden referring to &#145;the little urchin&#146; and &#145;the little medling hocus-pocus&#146;  (Rushworth, 2.803). Laud naturally assumed this referred to him. Williams and Osbaldeston were brought to trial in Star Chamber on 14 February 1639, and the latter was condemned to lose all his spiritualities, to pay a fine of &pound;5000 to the king and a like sum to Laud, and to have his ears nailed to the pillory, one in Palace Yard, Westminster, the other outside the school. While the lord keeper was giving judgment Osbaldeston, who was in court but not in custody, hurried home, burnt some documents, and wrote on a paper left on his desk: &#145;If the Arch-bishop inquire after me, tell him, I am gone beyond Canterbury&#146;  (ibid., 2.817). This simple ruse outwitted his pursuers, who searched the Kent ports in vain. It was to be alleged that the archbishop had been prepared to intercede for remission of the corporal punishment and to forbear &#145;anything done in order to his apprehension&#146;  (Heylyn, 221). Osbaldeston hid in Drury Lane until parliament met in November 1640.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Osbaldeston had been deprived of his mastership and his church preferments, but he was restored to the latter by the Long Parliament in 1641 after he had petitioned the Lords through the earl of Bedford  (BL, Harleian MS 6424, fol. 8, cited in C. S. R. Russell, <span class="italic">The Fall of the British Monarchies</span>, 1991, 249). He was pardoned by the king on 28 May 1641 and restored to his Westminster canonry. On 2 November following he was collated to the prebend of Ilton in Wells Cathedral, being installed on 8 November. Subsequently his parochial living was again sequestered. In 1645 an ordinance of parliament for the college of Westminster named him as the only canon who had not deserted his charge. By the act of 1649 which continued the school (following the abolition of deans and chapters) he was given an annuity of &pound;100, which he received until his death.<br>
<br>As headmaster Osbaldeston promoted the study of English composition and of geography. He fostered the school's dramatic tradition, though he may have discontinued the play briefly in sympathy for his friend William Prynne, punished in 1634 for writing against the stage. Osbaldeston's pupils included the future Archbishop John Dolben and future politicians Henry Bennet, later earl of Arlington, and Heneage Finch, later earl of Nottingham, as well as Abraham Cowley, whose <span class="italic">Pyramus and Thisbe</span>, written at the age of ten, was dedicated to his headmaster. Osbaldeston received a poetic dedication from another Westminster, Thomas Randolph. The only known composition by Osbaldeston himself is a poem presented to Charles I on the king's recovery from smallpox in 1632. Osbaldeston was buried on 7 October 1659 in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey, without any memorial.<br>
