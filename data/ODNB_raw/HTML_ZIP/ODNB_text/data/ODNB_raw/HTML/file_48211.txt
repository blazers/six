<span class="headword">Bailey, Sir  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1898&#150;1969), <span class="occ">politician and co-operative movement activist</span>, was born on 1 January 1898 in Miskin, Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, one of six children of John Bailey, miner, and his wife, Sarah Ann. Bailey attended Gwyn Ivor School, Miskin, until he was twelve. Working initially in a cobbler's shop, he entered the mines as a collier's boy. An accident in 1915 forced him to take a surface job, and in 1917 he enlisted in the South Wales Borderers and served in France.<br>
<br>Bailey returned to the mines in 1919. He studied economics through a correspondence course, administered at Ruskin College, Oxford, and joined the Independent Labour Party. Born into a Wesleyan Methodist family, Bailey considered entering the ministry. In 1921, however, he received a South Wales Miners' Federation scholarship to the Central Labour College in London. He unsuccessfully contested his first local government election, at Kensington, in 1922. Bailey also met Anne Glaser, whom he later married, in 1926; they had one son and two daughters. After returning home in 1923, Bailey was elected to Mountain Ash urban district council. In 1925 he was appointed as political secretary to the Co-operative Party in Bradford, Yorkshire. He served on Bradford city council (in 1928&#150;31 and 1933&#150;8), leading the juvenile employment and education committees.<br>
<br>Declining opportunities to stand for parliament, Bailey became a London-based national organizer for the Co-operative Party in 1936. In 1942 he succeeded S. F. Perry as the party's general secretary. Bailey was unsuccessful in recruiting candidates from among co-operative traders and initially the Co-operative Party hardly distinguished itself from its Labour parliamentary allies. However, post-war nationalization led co-operators, including Bailey, to question the apparent growth of centralized and bureaucratic state control, advocating instead democratic social ownership through co-operative and municipal enterprise. Tensions were heightened by the co-operative movement's defence of its own insurance society against Labour proposals of 1949 for nationalization of industrial insurance. Throughout the 1950s Labour policy was criticized as neglectful of consumer interests and of co-operation's potential role in economic and social regeneration. Bailey was instrumental in establishing the Co-operative Party's distinctive voice.<br>
<br>Bailey led negotiations concerning organizational relations between the Co-operative and Labour parties. In 1946 it was agreed that Co-operative parliamentarians would stand as &#145;Co-operative and Labour&#146; candidates and, on election, join the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). However, while co-operators resented the lack of consultation on Labour policy development, other interested groups sought to curb Co-operative nomination of parliamentary candidates and impose greater discipline over Co-operative members of the PLP. Bailey actively opposed the 1956 proposal that individual co-operative societies affiliate directly to constituency Labour parties. In 1958, however, he conceded limits on the number of Co-operative parliamentary candidates.<br>
<br>Bailey wrote extensively, in Co-operative Party policy statements, as editor of the party's <span class="italic">Monthly Newsletter</span>, in other journals, and as author of a popular textbook, <span class="italic">The British Co-operative Movement</span> (1955, revised edn 1960). His interests embraced the global, including work for the International Co-operative Alliance in eastern Europe and Africa, and the local, as secretary of Cheshunt and Waltham Cross Co-operative Party and vice-chairman of the East Hertfordshire Labour Party. He was also a director of the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society from 1952 and became president in 1968.<br>
<br>After retirement as Co-operative Party secretary in 1962 Bailey served on the national federation negotiating committee which considered amalgamation of national co-operative institutions to form a single focus for the movement. He presided at the Co-operative Congress of 1964 and was knighted in 1965. Bailey died in hospital at Enfield after a short illness on 18 January 1969. His funeral was held on 24 January at Enfield crematorium; Bailey was survived by his wife and children.<br>
<br>Self-discipline and hard work, combined with a belief in co-operative democracy as an economic and political philosophy, made Bailey a formidable political operator. Yet he also had &#145;some of the mystique (and occasional vagueness) of the visionary&#146;  (Carbery, 52). Bailey secured the constitutional relationship between the Labour and Co-operative parties and ensured a co-operative contribution to British politics.<br>
