<span class="headword">Davenport <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harvey]</span>,  Mary Ann</span>  (1759&#150;1843), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at Launceston, Cornwall. Her stage d&eacute;but took place at Bath on 21 December 1784, when she appeared as Lappet in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">The Miser</span>. After two seasons at Bath she performed in Exeter and Bristol, where in 1786 she married George Gosling Davenport (1758?&#150;1814), a provincial actor. The pair were itinerant strollers before they were engaged at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, in 1792. She opened as Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and continued to specialize in juvenile heroines. In an emergency, however, she undertook the part of an old woman. The experiment was a success, and she was never able to return to her former line.<br>
<br>The next season, the Davenports were engaged at Covent Garden, each earning &pound;2 a week. On 24 September 1794 Mary Ann appeared as Mrs Hardcastle in Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. In the course of the season she played Lady Wronghead in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>, the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and the title role in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>. She remained at Covent Garden for the next thirty-six years, though she spent some summer seasons at the Haymarket, and proved a well-respected favourite. By 1824&#150;5 she was making &pound;12 a week. Original parts included Deborah Dowlas in Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>, Dame Ashfield in Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">Speed the Plough</span>, Mrs Brulgruddery in Colman's <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, and Monica in William Dimond's <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span>.<br>
<br>Davenport was complimented in <span class="italic">Oxberry's Dramatic Biography</span> (1825) for her private character as &#145;a hospitable, generous, kind-hearted creature&#146; and described as &#145;of the common size&#146;, with a light complexion and blue eyes. Her husband also acted at Covent Garden, but was perceived as the lesser performer and was the object of some banter in the theatrical records. However, he was a useful member of the company and served as secretary to the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund until his retirement in 1812. After his death, on 13 March 1814, Mary Ann lived in seclusion with her daughter, and contemporary sources commend her continued reliability on the stage. She retired on 25 May 1830, appearing for the last time as the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>.<br>
<br>Davenport died at her house, 17 St Michael's Place, Brompton, on 8 May 1843, aged eighty-four, and was buried seven days later at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (July 1843) recorded that she lived alone, and that her children, a daughter, and a son with a post in India, had predeceased her. Their names are unknown: the Maria Gosling Davenport of Hammersmith, who was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 1 February 1838, aged forty-seven, is presumed to have been her daughter.<br>
