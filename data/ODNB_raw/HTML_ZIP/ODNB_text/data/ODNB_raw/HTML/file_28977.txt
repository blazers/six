<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas Henry  Weist-</span>  (1828&#150;1891), <span class="occ">violinist and conductor</span>, son of Thomas Hill, goldsmith and freeman of the City, was born in Islington, London, on 3 January 1828. He showed an aptitude for the violin at an early age and appeared at Gravesend as an infant prodigy. In 1844 he entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with Prosper Sainton and in 1845 was awarded the king's scholarship. He was subsequently a professor of the violin at the Royal Academy and conducted its choir and orchestra. He then joined the orchestra of the Princess Theatre, but he soon became known as a concert violinist, and was taken up first by Edward Loder and then by Louis Jullien. With the latter he toured in the United States of America, where he gave the first American performance of Mendelssohn's violin concerto, and later visited several European cities. On his return to London he was engaged as first violin in the Royal Italian Opera orchestra by Michael Costa.<br>
<br>When the Alexandra Palace opened in 1873 Weist-Hill was appointed music director, and until 1876 he performed works by British composers and held a symphony competition for them; he also revived forgotten works, such as Handel's <span class="italic">Esther</span> and <span class="italic">Susanna</span>. In 1878 he conducted the orchestral concerts of Madame Viard-Louis at St James's Hall, at which several works by French composers were heard for the first time in England, including Bizet's suite <span class="italic">L'Arl&eacute;sienne</span> and pieces by Massenet, Gounod, and Berlioz. He conducted the first performance in London of Brahms's second symphony. In 1880 he was appointed first principal of the Guildhall School of Music, where he also taught the violin.<br>
<br>In 1885 the journal <span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span> regarded Weist-Hill as the greatest living English conductor. He wrote a few compositions, mostly for violin and cello, of which the <span class="italic">Pompadour Gavotte</span> became popular. He died of cancer at South Kensington, London, on 25 December 1891. His two sons also became musicians; one of them, Ferdinand Weist-Hill, was a well-known violinist.<br>
