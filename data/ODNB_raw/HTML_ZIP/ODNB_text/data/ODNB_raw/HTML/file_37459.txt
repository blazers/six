<span class="headword">Gleitze,  Mercedes</span>  (1900&#150;1981), <span class="occ">swimmer</span>, was born at 124 Freshfield Road, Brighton, on 18 November 1900, the youngest of three daughters (there were no sons) of Heinrich Gleitze, journeyman baker, and his wife, Anna Kurr, a language teacher. She spent her childhood partly in Brighton and partly with her grandparents in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, and was educated in both countries, including two years at the Maria Stern Convent School, N&ouml;rdlingen. In the early 1920s, while working as a bilingual secretary in Westminster, she spent her spare time training in the Thames to become a long-distance swimmer. In 1923 she set a British ladies' record for Thames swimming (10 hr 45 min.). In 1927 she swam the 120 miles from London to Folkestone in stages; and on 7 October 1927, at her eighth attempt, she became the first Englishwoman to swim the channel (from France to England in 15 hr 15 min.). In 1928 she became the first person ever to swim the Straits of Gibraltar (in 12 hr 50 min.). Between 1927 and 1932 she also swam the Wash, Lough Neagh, from Portstewart in Ulster to Moville in the Irish Free State, Loch Ryan, the Firth of Forth, around the Isle of Man (100 miles) in stages, the Hellespont (from Europe to Asia Minor), the Sea of Marmora, Wellington harbour, Galway Bay, and from Cape Town to Robben Island, both ways (the first person to complete the double), as well as many more swims in South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. During these years she also held the British record for endurance swimming, extending it from 26 hr in January 1930 to 44 hr 30 min. by the end of the year, then to 45 hr in 1931, and finally to 46 hr in 1932. These swims were mainly in municipal baths, and she was supported by the community singing of the thousands of people who filed in to see her perform. She retired in 1932.<br>
<br>Driven by an urge to alleviate poverty during the depression, Gleitze worked hard to secure sponsorship for her swims and in 1928 set up a trust fund to finance the Mercedes Gleitze homes for destitute men and women. She purchased a large eight-bedroomed house in Leicester, and had it converted into flats, which were then made available to homeless families. These homes were run under the caretakership of the Leicester Rotary club, which was involved in a scheme to move families from distressed areas in the north of England to Leicester; the Mercedes Gleitze homes provided temporary accommodation until employment and permanent lodgings could be found. The homes were used for this purpose from 1933 until the outbreak of war in 1939, when they were used by the Leicester Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia. Although her homes were destroyed by enemy action in November 1940, her charity is still active under the trusteeship of the Family Welfare Association. In keeping with the spirit of the founder's intention, its funds are targeted towards grants to alleviate need arising from homelessness&#151;the demand for such support being as great at the start of the twenty-first century as when she first set up the trust.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1930, at St Paul's Roman Catholic Church, Dover, Mercedes Gleitze, whose occupation was recorded as professional swimmer, married Patrick Joseph Carey (1904&#150;1983), originally of Dublin, a sheet metal engineer and later a technical representative, the son of Patrick Carey, also a sheet metal engineer. They had two daughters and a son. Gleitze died at Colindale Hospital, London, on 9 February 1981, and was cremated three days later at Hendon crematorium.<br>
