<span class="headword">Elmer <span class="st"> [&AElig;thelmaer, Herlewin]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1137), <span class="occ">prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, and theologian</span>, may have come to England from Bec but certainly became a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury. The first abbot of Bec was called Herluin, and Elmer's use of this name may support the view that he spent some time at Bec. But his baptismal name, which is Old English in origin, may indicate that he was English by birth. He was one of the younger monks at Christ Church in the time of Archbishop Anselm (<i>d</i>. 1109), who greeted him in a letter while he was himself still at Bec and Elmer was already at Canterbury.<br>
<br>Elmer became prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, at a date between 1128 and 1130. He was in office at the dedication of the cathedral church on 4 May 1130. Gervase of Canterbury records that in 1136 there was a dispute between the cathedral priory monks and Archbishop William de Corbeil, who died in November of that year, about the church of St Martin at Dover, in which Elmer seems to have felt that honour required him to side with William. He attested a charter of Archbishop William between 1128 and 1136 and, with his monks, confirmed that they had witnessed a charter of Archbishop William between 1130 and 1136. Elmer died on 11 May 1137, according to his obit in BL, Arundel MS 68, folio 27.<br>
<br>In writing his own letters and meditations Elmer achieved a style not wholly unworthy of a pupil of Anselm of Canterbury, although he is master of a monastic spirituality rather than a theologian. Gervase of Canterbury calls him &#145;a man of great simplicity and excellent religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.98). He is the author of more than a dozen letters, several meditations, and a sermon, on whose subject matter and approach the Anselmian stamp is clear. One letter survives in Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Digby 30, folios 99&#150;100. Letter S is also in Oxford, Magdalen College, MS 60, folios 222&#150;6. BL, Cotton MS Otho A.xii, contained fifteen letters; this was burnt in the fire of 1731 and only fragments survive, but there is a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century copy, probably of this manuscript, now Cambridge, Trinity College, MS 1468 (0.10.16), 410&#150;16, containing mainly letter collections, among them letters of Elmer to an abbot called Andrew, to Henry, to Nicholas of Gloucester, to Willermus, and to seven others. The Cambridge manuscript has meditations <span class="italic">De cordis munditia</span> (&#145;Of pureness of heart&#146;), <span class="italic">De bono vitae claustralis</span> (&#145;Of the good of the monastic life&#146;), and <span class="italic">Excitatio mentis in inquisitionem Dei</span> (&#145;The arousal of the mind in the search for God&#146;), along with a <span class="italic">Sermo Elmeri</span> (<span class="italic">Beatus venter</span>; &#145;Blessed is the womb&#146;), and a sermon on the gospel proper to masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The first of the meditations (<span class="italic">Excitatio mentis</span>) was edited by Gerberon among the <span class="italic">Meditationes Anselmi</span>. A third is found with the second (<span class="italic">Querimonia de absentia vultus Dei</span>; &#145;Complaint of the absence of God's countenance&#146;) in various collections of Anselm's meditations, but it is not found in the Cambridge manuscript. The meditations are mentioned in letter 6 to Nicholas, a monk of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, and they follow it in the manuscript. The letters themselves include elements of &#145;spiritual writing&#146;, notably in the meditative material <span class="italic">De cordis munditia</span> which Elmer included in letter 3 to Abbot Turstanus (Thurstan).<br>
