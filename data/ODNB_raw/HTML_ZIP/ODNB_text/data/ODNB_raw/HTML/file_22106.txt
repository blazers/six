<span class="headword">Philip,  Robert</span>  (1791&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born at Huntly, in Aberdeenshire, in May 1791, the eldest son of an elder in the church of George Cowie, the founder of Independency in northern Scotland. After his father's death in 1806, Philip moved to Aberdeen, where he was employed as a clerk in the Grandholm works. In 1811 he was admitted to Hoxton Academy, under Dr Robert Simpson. In 1815 he became minister at Newington Chapel, Liverpool. Here he devoted his attention to the spiritual welfare of seafarers, and published <span class="italic">The Bethel Flag, or, Sermons to Seamen</span> (1823). He remained in Liverpool for ten years.<br>
<br>In July 1818 Philip had married Hannah, daughter of Nathaniel Lassell of Bolton, Lancashire, and sister of William Lassell, the astronomer. They had at least one son. In 1826 they moved to London, where Philip became minister of Maberly Chapel, Kingsland, and from then on he devoted himself to writing a series of religious manuals, which enjoyed considerable vogue both in Britain and America. They included <span class="italic">Christian Experience, or, A Guide to the Perplexed</span> (1828), which, with five other works, was reprinted in New York in 1867 as <span class="italic">Devotional Guides</span>; two volumes on manly piety, also published in one volume in New York as <span class="italic">The Young Man's Closet Library</span> (1838); and four works on female virtue, collectively entitled <span class="italic">The Young Ladies' Closet Library</span> (1834&#150;41). He also published a study of the practical works of Richard Baxter (1838, 1847), as well as the lives of George Whitefield (1837) and John Bunyan (1839), both of which were largely composed of extracts and were principally remarkable for their strongly evangelical tone. He was made an honorary DD of Dartmouth College, Massachusetts, in 1852.<br>
<br>Philip served on the board of the London Missionary Society, and sought to extend its operations, especially in China: he was a convinced opponent of the opium trade, and published sermons and pamphlets against it. He also wrote biographies of the missionaries John Philip, William Milne, and John Campbell. Owing to poor health Philip resigned from Maberly Chapel in 1855, and died at his home, Maberley Cottage, Richmond Road, Dalston, London, on 1 May 1858. He was buried in Abney Park cemetery.<br>
