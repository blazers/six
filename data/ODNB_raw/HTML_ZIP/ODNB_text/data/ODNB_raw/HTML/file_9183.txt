<span class="headword">Farquharson,  John</span>  (1699&#150;1782), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 19 April 1699 at Auchindryne, Braemar, Aberdeenshire, the second son of Lewis Farquharson (<i>d</i>. 1727&times;9), laird of Auchindryne, and his wife (and first cousin), Margaret Farquharson (<i>d</i>. 1719&times;33). In July 1714 he went to the Scots College at Douai, French Flanders, and in September 1718 he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Tournai in the Southern Netherlands. Having made his vows on 20 September 1720 he studied philosophy and taught humanities, and then, after four years' further study, graduated in theology. He returned to Scotland in October 1729 as a priest and, being a Gaelic speaker was, after some time near Dingwall with William Mackenzie, fifth earl of Seaforth, stationed in Strathglass in eastern Inverness-shire, a traditionally Catholic district.<br>
<br>Farquharson was professed of the four vows on 2 February 1736. His activities in Strathglass gave much concern to the local presbytery in 1743&#150;4. After the defeat at Culloden in 1746 he gave himself up to save his people from spoliation; he was taken by boat from Inverness and confined in a man-of-war in the River Thames for some months under harsh conditions. Released and exiled after fifteen months' imprisonment, he was at Douai in February 1748, but he set out for Scotland in July and served again in Strathglass. Being captured in 1753 and having his bail forfeited, he went to Douai once more, and was made prefect of studies. When Jesuits were banned in France in 1764 he accompanied the community to Dinant in the Southern Netherlands and he was minister in the college in 1766&#150;9; after the suppression of the order in 1773, he returned to Scotland and settled with his nephew in Braemar, where he died on 22 August 1782. He was buried in Castleton kirkyard, Braemar.<br>
<br>Information on Farquharson from oral tradition is anecdotal and imprecise and sometimes conflicts with the evidence. He is said to have built a chapel and house at Fasnakyle in Strathglass and at some point to have been captured by government soldiers and taken to Fort Augustus, but released. A Gaelic poem by him, <span class="italic">Rabhadh MhicShimidh</span> (&#145;Warning to Lord Lovat&#146;), has survived and he transcribed a volume of Gaelic poetry, mostly Ossianic, from oral sources, which was left at Douai and later maltreated and destroyed. Bishop John Geddes commended Farquharson's simplicity and exemplary virtue.<br>
