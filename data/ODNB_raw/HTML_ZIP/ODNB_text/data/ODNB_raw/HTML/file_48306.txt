<span class="headword">Venutius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51&#150;<em>c.</em>71), <span class="occ">king in Britain</span>, was a man of high rank, of the tribe of the Brigantes, which during the Roman period in Britain occupied almost the whole of the area from the Humber to the line of Hadrian's Wall, with the exception of what is now south-east Yorkshire and with the possible addition of territory in south-west Scotland. He was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41192/', "Cartimandua, queen of the Brigantes")</script>. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his account of this period, the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, singles out Venutius as the outstanding British general after the capture of Caratacus in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51 and a man who had long been loyal to Rome, and protected by her, as noted in an earlier passage. This earlier reference to Venutius is not extant, so it must have been in the lost part of Tacitus, for <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43&#150;7. It may be assumed that Cartimandua's alliance with Rome, supported by Venutius, dated from the invasion in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 or not long after. Venutius then quarrelled with Cartimandua; his brother and relations were captured by her; and an invasion of Cartimandua's kingdom was launched as a response by a war band led by Venutius, presumably from the north, since Rome held the south. Roman forces were involved in supporting their ally, the queen, and were in the end successful in repelling the invasion. These events took place under the governor Didius Gallus, whose term of office was <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 52&#150;7.<br>
<br>Tacitus had already written the history of the years <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69&#150;96 in the <span class="italic">Histories</span>, and in that account the story of Venutius and Cartimandua and its end is told in highly compressed form. Here it was the glory of having handed over Caratacus to the Romans that led to Cartimandua increasing in wealth and extravagance. She rejected Venutius in favour of his armour bearer Vellocatus, whom she took as her new consort. Venutius summoned allies and the Brigantes themselves revolted. Cartimandua sought support from Rome; she was rescued; but the kingdom was left to Venutius, with war against the Brigantes inevitable when Rome's hands were freed from the civil war in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69 that had given Venutius his opportunity. The story as told in the <span class="italic">Histories</span> seems at first to imply a much shorter time scale than the story in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, but the beginning of the trouble is clearly stated to be not long after the capture of Caratacus and the final triumph of Venutius linked to the opportunity offered by Roman civil war in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69. It would appear, therefore, that Venutius nursed his grievances in exile from the early <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 50s to 69.<br>
<br>Sir Mortimer Wheeler thought that he had located Venutius's stronghold in the great defended enclosure at Stanwick, in north Yorkshire. More recent work and thinking rejects this notion and that of a &#145;battle of Stanwick&#146; and sees Stanwick as an <i>oppidum</i>, a proto-urban centre, receiving luxury items from the Roman world, and therefore much more probably to be linked to the pro-Roman queen Cartimandua.<br>
<br>In Tacitus's terse description in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> of the conquest of the Brigantes by Petillius Cerialis, there is no reference to Venutius. There may be one other reference, by the poet Statius, eulogizing the achievements of an earlier governor of Britain, Vettius Bolanus (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69&#150;71), for the benefit of Bolanus's son and referring to the trophies Bolanus dedicated in Britain, among them the breastplate which he took from a British king. As it was Bolanus who rescued Cartimandua, it may not be too fanciful to see here a reference to Venutius. If so, Venutius survived this encounter, perhaps to perish in fighting against Cerialis, governor from <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 71 to 73 or 74.<br>
