<span class="headword">Lankrink,  Prosper Henricus</span>  (1628&#150;1692), <span class="occ">painter and collector</span>, was born in Germany, the only son of an army officer who had moved to Antwerp to take up a commission in the Flemish army. After his father's death, his mother ensured Lankrink was well educated (Vertue refers to a &#145;liberal&#146; education) with the intention he would enter holy orders. However, after revealing a real talent for painting and drawing, it was agreed that he should instead serve an apprenticeship with a local painter and study at the Antwerp Academy, where he soon developed into a promising landscape artist. Formative influences at this stage were the work of Titian and Salvator Rosa which he was able to study in the collection of a local collector, Myn Heer Lyam. Following his mother's death, Lankrink is said to have visited Italy before arriving in London in the mid-1660s. He lived first in Piccadilly and then from 1686 until his death in 1692 at 2 Great Piazza, Covent Garden, in the north-west corner of this fashionable development.<br>
<br>During the 1670s and 1680s Lankrink enjoyed a successful independent practice as a landscape and decorative painter. An early patron was the naval commander Sir Edward Spragge who introduced him to fellow collectors and patrons, most notably Sir William Williams, who became a major collector of Lankrink's work. According to Vertue, Williams's house was almost &#145;intirely furnished&#146; with Lankrink's paintings, all of which were destroyed soon after by fire. Very few other examples of his work survive or can indeed now be identified. But from examples that do periodically appear in the sale rooms and descriptions in earlier sale catalogues, his paintings seem to have been heavily indebted to seventeenth-century Italian classical landscape artists, and characterized by a broad sweep of sky, framing blocks of foliage and classical ruins and peopled by small pastoral or biblical figures. According to one contemporary, Bainbrigg Buckeridge, writing in 1706, Lankrink's paintings were &#145;wonderful, both as to the invention, harmony, colouring and warmth, but above all surprisingly beautiful and free in their skies, which by general consent excell'd all the works of the most eminent Painters in that kind&#146;  (Buckeridge, 399&#150;400). His skill in portraying small figures, Buckeridge maintained, resulted from his &#145;practising drawing by the life&#146;  (ibid.). On the evidence of the sale catalogue of his own collection (see below) he also produced a number of portraits including a self-portrait and a portrait of the artist and copyist Symon Stone, both &#145;done 3 ways&#146; (showing the sitters in three positions). Only one print after his work, a mezzotint by John Smith after <span class="italic">Nymphs Bathing</span>, is now known.<br>
<br>In addition to his own independent practice, Lankrink was closely involved with the studio of Peter Lely, Charles II's principal painter, where he was employed to paint flowers, ornaments, landscape backgrounds, and occasionally draperies. Not surprisingly therefore, as someone familiar with the Covent Garden studio, he played an important part in the dispersal of its contents following Lely's death in 1680, completing a number of unfinished canvases, helping to organize the sale of artist's materials, and purchasing for himself items as varied as pigments, drawing paper, frames, &#145;42 postures without head&#146;, &#145;11 palettes&#146;, and &#145;16 gross of pencils&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 16174, fol. 21<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>As well as listing his qualities as a painter, many contemporaries acknowledged Lankrink's importance as a collector. He began forming his collection in Antwerp and seems to have taken advantage of the dispersal of both Rubens's and Rembrandt's collections in the 1650s. He continued to collect after he arrived in London, regularly attending the growing number of art auctions held in Covent Garden and Lincoln's Inn Fields and buying extensively at Lely's paintings and drawings sales in 1682 and 1688. Frequent references in Constantijn Huygens's journal to Lankrink accompanying other collectors to auctions, attending sale previews, going through the stock of artist&#150;dealer friends, and offering conservation advice about fellow collectors' drawings suggest that he was a well-known and respected figure in the art circles of Restoration London. At his death in 1692 his collection was described as &#145;certainly the most Curious and the most Numerous, that ever was seen in this Country, in a private man's possession&#146;. Totalling some 464 items it comprised mainly sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish landscape, still-life and flower pieces, portraits, and subject pictures, including works by Lely, Rembrandt, and Rubens plus a handful of works &#145;in the manner of Tintoretto and Titian&#146;  (Cust, 30&#150;32, 35). It was sold by auction on 23 January 1693 from his house in the Great Piazza. His collection of old master drawings, with a similar Dutch and Flemish bias, but also containing works by sixteenth-century Italian artists such as Parmigianino and Veronese, was sold the following year, having first been stamped with his characteristic PHL collector's mark.<br>
<br>Lankrink was described by Vertue as of a &#145;debonnair-temper &hellip; a good Bottle Companion, &amp; Excellent Company but also a grate Favourite of the ladies&#146; and was clearly popular among his many friends and acquaintances  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.145). He lived well and was often in debt; at his death at his home in 1692 his collection had to be sold to clear his outstanding debts and he had borrowed heavily from a friend and fellow collector Mr Austen to finance his purchases at Lely's sales. He appears never to have married and left no will. At his particular request he was buried facing the garden under the great porch of St Paul's, Covent Garden. The preface to his painting sale catalogue serves as a fitting epitaph to this relatively little known but intriguing and talented character:<blockquote>Mr <i>Lankrink</i> has been look'd upon as one of the most excellent Painters in <i>Europe</i>, as well in respect to the Perfection of his own Painting, as for his great Knowledge, and vast Understanding, in what is left, of the finest and most finish'd Pieces, of the greatest Masters. Other Nations have envied the Happiness we have had, of enjoying such a famous Man, for several years. (Cust, 30)</blockquote>
