<span class="headword">Laurence</span> <span class="st"> [St Laurence, Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail, Laurence O'Toole]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1128&#150;1180), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin</span>, was probably born about 1128, the son of Muirchertach Ua Tuathail, king of U&iacute; Muiredaig (in north Leinster). According to the compilation known as the <span class="italic">Ban-Shenchus</span> (&#145;Lore of women&#146;), his mother was the daughter of Cerball Mac Br&iacute;c; but according to his early thirteenth-century hagiographical life his mother was Derbail, daughter of Ua Brain (almost certainly of the north Leinster dynasty of U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in). The same source states that Laurence served as a hostage for his father at an early age with Diarmait Mac Murchada, overking of Leinster, who mistreated him (bearing in mind, however, that this king is accorded a consistently hostile depiction throughout the life).<h2>
<a name="Monkbishopandarchbishop"></a>Monk, bishop, and archbishop</h2>Laurence became a monk at the important north Leinster monastery of Glendalough and in 1153 succeeded to the office of abbot. According to the life he was then aged twenty-five, though in saying this the author may have been conditioned by requirements of canon law. His succession to the abbacy may be presumed to have had the approval of Diarmait Mac Murchada as provincial king of Leinster, and this is further suggested by the fact that around that time Mac Murchada married Laurence's half-sister, M&oacute;r. Laurence declined to accept promotion to the bishopric of Glendalough when it became vacant in 1157, according to his life because he had not reached the canonical age of thirty. Another possible reason is that most of the lands of Glendalough were still attached to the abbacy rather than to the cathedral church, and that acceptance of the episcopal office may not have been viewed as advancement. More ambitious motives for Laurence's refusal may be suggested by the fact that in 1162 he was prepared to accept elevation to the more prestigious archbishopric of Dublin. At the Synod of Kells of 1152, the papal legate, Cardinal Giovanni Paparo, had intended that after the death of its incumbent the diocese of Glendalough should be united to the diocese of Dublin. However, when Glendalough did fall vacant in 1157, its incorporation into Dublin was not effected, for reasons unknown.<br>
<br>Laurence's succession to Dublin in 1162 was almost certainly approved at the Synod of Clane held in that year, presided over by Gilla Cr&iacute;st (Christianus) Ua Connairche, bishop of Lismore and papal legate, and Gilla Meic Liac (Gelasius), archbishop of Armagh. He was consecrated as archbishop by Archbishop Gilla Meic Liac in his capacity as primate, assisted by Joseph, bishop of Ferns, and Malachias Ua Brain, bishop of Kildare. The participation of these two bishops, who were associates of Diarmait Mac Murchada, suggests the latter's consent to the promotion. It may also be significant that between 1160 and 1162, as abbot of Glendalough, Laurence had witnessed Mac Murchada's charter to St Mary's Abbey, Ferns, and between 1162 and 1165, as archbishop, attested his charters to Killenny and All Hallows. However, a disputed succession to the abbacy of Glendalough followed Laurence's promotion to Dublin, with his nephew (known only by his Latin name of Thomas) eventually succeeding him. This appointment is presented in the partisan life as a victory for canonical procedures, and as emphatically made on the grounds of personal merit (although there is other evidence to suggest that Thomas fathered at least one son), and in the face of an attempted intrusion by Diarmait Mac Murchada of another candidate. In 1167 Laurence attended the large assembly of clergy and laity convened by Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht and claimant to the high-kingship, which suggests that he was prepared to acknowledge Ua Conchobair as high-king.<h2>
<a name="AngloIrishaffairs"></a>Anglo-Irish affairs</h2>Following the beginnings of Anglo-Norman intervention in Ireland, Laurence negotiated on behalf of the city of Dublin before it was taken by force by Diarmait Mac Murchada and his Anglo-Norman allies in 1170. It would be rash, however, to draw firm conclusions about Laurence's political allegiance from his role as mediator, since throughout the twelfth century Irish churchmen had been very actively engaged as peace negotiators. In 1171 Laurence is depicted by Gerald of Wales as acting in consort with Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair in seeking to raise mercenaries for the siege of Dublin, held by Richard fitz Gilbert, earl of Pembroke and lord of Striguil (known as Strongbow), and as acting with Ua Conchobair in sending letters to Godred, king of Man; Gerald attributes Laurence's motives to &#145;zeal for his own people&#146;  (Giraldus Cambrensis, 78&#150;9). Laurence attended the Council of Cashel convened by Henry II, 1171&#150;2, and in 1172 Pope Alexander III named him in letters exhorting the Irish bishops to aid Henry in ruling Ireland. The pipe roll of 1172/3 records payment of his passage to Ireland in the company of William fitz Aldelin, indicating that he had visited England and had made representations to Henry.<br>
<br>In October 1175 Laurence witnessed the treaty concluded at Windsor between Henry II and Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, which delimited Leinster, Meath, and a portion of Munster as an Angevin sphere of influence, and conceded to Ua Conchobair overlordship of the remainder of Ireland, provided that he acknowledged Henry as his superior, maintained loyalty to him, and paid tribute. While in England, according to his life, Laurence survived an assassination attempt at Canterbury, made by a madman who sought to draw comparisons between him and the martyred Thomas Becket. He travelled back to Ireland in the company of Augustinus Ua Selbaig, bishop-elect of Waterford, to whose appointment Henry had assented at Windsor. The city of Waterford had been reserved by Henry as royal demesne and Laurence was clearly prepared to allow such a right of assent to the king. He presided at the burial of Strongbow in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Dublin, in April 1176. An original charter with seal attached, issued by him between 1176 and 1178, confirming a grant of Killester (in north Dublin) to William Brun, constitutes the earliest surviving original charter of an Irish bishop.<h2>
<a name="Papallegate"></a>Papal legate</h2>Shortly after Christmas 1178, Laurence set out to attend the Third Lateran Council, due to be held in the following year, travelling via the court of Henry II to seek his permission to be present, and swearing an oath that he would do nothing to diminish the king's rights at the council. He secured a privilege of protection from Pope Alexander III, dated 20 April 1179, confirming him and his successor in their rights in the see of Dublin and its churches, and in its five suffragan bishoprics; he may also be considered responsible for procuring a privilege of protection, dated 13 May 1179, for Malchus, bishop of Glendalough. The pope also appointed Laurence <i>legatus natus</i> (his resident legate) in Ireland, to replace Gilla Cr&iacute;st Ua Connairche. On his return to Ireland, in his capacity as papal legate, Laurence convened a synod at Clonfert in 1179. An account of the synod survives only in a garbled seventeenth-century English translation of the annals of Clonmacnoise, which indicates, however, that he sought to proclaim the decrees of the Lateran Council. The location of the synod (at which is recorded the attendance of the clergy of Connacht, as well as that of Echthigern Mac M&aacute;elchiar&aacute;in (Eugenius), bishop of Meath, and M&aacute;el&iacute;su Ua Cerbaill, bishop of Louth, or Airgialla, both suffragan bishops of Armagh) suggests that it was intended to serve for the sphere of influence which had been allocated to Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair by the treaty of Windsor. Laurence's life has an account of his charitable activities during the severe winter of 1179, including the sending of a shipload of distressed Irish to England, where he arranged that they should receive aid from friendly benefactors. Early in 1180 he installed Tommaltach Ua Conchobair, bishop of Elphin and nephew of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, in the see of Armagh. The translation of a Connacht bishop to the primatial see of Armagh was unprecedented and suggests a close association with Ua Conchobair.<br>
<br>According to Roger of Howden, soon after the feast of the Purification (2 February), in 1180 Laurence was at Henry II's court, accompanied by a son of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair; the latter was to be a pledge of Ua Conchobair's good faith in his undertaking to pay tribute owing to Henry, possibly on the basis of the treaty of Windsor, although there is no consensus among historians that the treaty was still in operation at that date. Notwithstanding the reference to tribute made by Howden (who was aware of the terms of the treaty of Windsor, the text of which he transcribed), it is also possible that Henry had objected to the appointment of Tommaltach to Armagh. Inconclusive negotiations between Laurence and Henry took place; Henry left for Normandy on 15 April 1180, and Laurence, who had been forbidden to return to Ireland before peace had been concluded, was obliged to remain in England. Late in October or early in November, Laurence crossed from Dover to Wissant near Boulogne. He was at Eu on 10 November, already suffering from a fever. On 11 November he sent a cleric named David, tutor of Ua Conchobair's son, to Henry's court, where the youth was handed over as a hostage. On 13 November David returned with news that peace had been concluded with Henry. Laurence died at Eu on 14 November 1180 and his burial there was presided over by the Roman subdeacon and papal legate, Alexis, who may have been involved in breaking the impasse in negotiations between Laurence and Henry.<h2>
<a name="Canonizationandcult"></a>Canonization and cult</h2>By 20 May 1191, when Pope Celestine replied to a petition for Laurence's canonization from Archbishop Walter of Rouen, by saying that the time was not opportune, a book of Laurence's miracles, compiled by Bishop M&aacute;elis&uacute; Ua Cerbaill, had already reached Eu. In 1206 Hugues, abbot of Eu, petitioning Innocent III for canonization, stated that this was the fifth such attempt made by the canons of Eu; in 1214 Abbot Guido petitioned again. Laurence was eventually canonized by Pope Honorius III on 11 December 1225, testimonies in support of his canonization having been provided by: the archbishop of Rouen; the abbot of Eu; John Cumin, Laurence's successor in the archbishopric of Dublin; Echdonn (Eugenius), archbishop of Armagh; Ailbe (Albinus), bishop of Ferns; and Marianus (Ua Briain), bishop of Cork. His relics were translated by Theobald, archbishop of Rouen, on 6 May 1226. It has been suggested that the earliest extant version of his life may have been compiled by Henry of London, archbishop of Dublin from 1213 to 1228. Soon after Laurence's canonization, a life, focusing chiefly on his miracles, was written by a canon of Eu, possibly Jean Halgrinus of Abbeville, later archbishop of Besan&ccedil;on.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales twice attributes to common report the view that Laurence was a man of excessive partiality for his own people; he also asserts that Laurence incurred the displeasure of Henry II in securing privileges at the Lateran Council of 1179, to which the king objected, although he does not specify any details. Gerald was mistaken in suggesting that Laurence was prevented from returning to Ireland after the council. However, he was also prepared to describe Laurence &#145;as a good and just man&#146;  (Giraldus Cambrensis, 196&#150;7), and recounts a miracle relating to his final days when he refused to rest at Abbeville because, with prophetic insight of his impending death, he wished to reach the basilica dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at Eu; this miracle is also recounted in the life. The saint's feast is celebrated on 14 November and the feast of the translation of his relics on 10 May; he has a place in the painted calendar of saints canonized in the thirteenth century in the basilica of the Four Crowned Martyrs at Rome. As in the case of St Malachy of Armagh, the circumstance of Laurence's death and burial on the continent ensured his canonization; he and Malachy remained the only formally canonized Irish saints until the canonization of Oliver Plunket in 1976. Laurence's reputation as an ecclesiastical reformer also rests chiefly on the dossier compiled for his canonization. Nevertheless, his promotion of church reform, which receives important emphasis in his life, is demonstrated by his introduction of Augustinian canons of the Arrouaisian filiation into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Dublin, a step which had been taken no later than 1176&#150;7.<br>
