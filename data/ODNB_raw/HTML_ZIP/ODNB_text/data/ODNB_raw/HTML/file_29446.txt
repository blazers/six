<span class="headword">Willet,  Thomas</span>  (1610/11&#150;1674), <span class="occ">mayor of New York City</span>, was one of thirteen surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29445/', "Andrew Willet (1561/2&#150;1621)")</script>, rector of Barley, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Jacobine (<i>d</i>. 1637), daughter of Roger Goad, provost of King's College, Cambridge. Nothing is known of his early life, but in his youth he joined the puritan exodus from England, moving first to Leiden in the Netherlands, and by 1629 to the New England colony of Plymouth plantation. His diplomatic skills first surfaced during successful trading with native Americans, for which he was complimented by Governor William Bradford and awarded the freedom of the colony by 1633. He later managed the Plymouth fur interests in Maine and continued to treat native Americans with respect. In 1636 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Major John Brown, with whom he had thirteen children. He slowly acquired stature in the colony, serving on committees distributing cattle to the poor in 1638&#150;44, appointed captain of the militia in 1647, and elected an assistant from 1651 to 1665. A 1647 pub brawl, during which Willet and others smashed their mugs after being affronted by some Dutch men and were chased off by the landlady wielding a lead bludgeon, does not seem to have damaged his reputation. While trading with native Americans, he acquired shares in ships and extended his business interests to the Dutch colony of New Netherland, where he became a familiar and trusted figure among Dutch leaders. When problems arose between the English and Dutch in 1650, he was appointed by Peter Stuyvesant as one of two arbitrators for the Dutch in final negotiations. Regarded as well educated, he was one of four men chosen by the town of Rehoboth in 1660 to &#145;transcribe the land records out of the former book&#146;  (Anderson, 3.1997), and in the same year moved to and helped found Swansey, Rhode Island. He also became a major landowner around Narragansett Bay.<br>
<br>When in 1664 the English expedition to conquer New Netherland arrived off Long Island, its leader, Colonel William Nicolls, contacted Willet and asked him to negotiate on his behalf with the Dutch. While his friend Stuyvesant wanted to resist the invasion forces, the terms Willet offered on behalf of Nicolls were attractive to civilian leaders, who forced Stuyvesant to surrender on 7 September. Nicolls spent the following year creating a government for the colony, and then turned to forming an administration for the newly named city of New York. He appointed Willet the first mayor in 1665, who served with a mixed group of English and Dutch aldermen. As he gave invaluable aid to Nicolls in the transition to English rule, Willet was reappointed two years later. He also served as a member of the provincial council under Governor Francis Lovelace, but had withdrawn from New York affairs by 1673 and retired to Swansey. His wife having died in 1669, in 1671 he married Joanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyse, widow of Peter Prudden. He died on 4 August 1674, &#145;in the sixty-fourth year of his age&#146; according to his gravestone  (Anderson, 3.1999), and was buried at the Little Neck cemetery, Riverside, in what is now East Providence. His will, dated April 1671 and proved in November 1674, reveals he was of some wealth, the inventory of his estate totalling &pound;2798 14<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., including &pound;1289 in real estate. He also left a substantial library containing over 100 volumes on subjects including theology, history, law, and navigation. He was survived by six of his children from his first marriage, including Thomas, who served on New York City provincial council; his grandson Martinus, a noted patriot, was also appointed mayor of New York City.<br>
