<span class="headword">Clifford,  Thomas</span>, sixth Baron Clifford  (1362/3&#150;1391), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5660/', "Roger Clifford, fifth Baron Clifford of Westmorland (1333&#150;1389)")</script>, and his wife, Maud Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1403). His father started providing for Thomas's future when he was still an infant, in 1365 granting him the Westmorland manor of King's Meaburn for life. Then in 1373 arrangements were made for his marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Lord Ros of Helmsley, which had taken place by 2 November. It was apparently a condition of the match that Roger Clifford should settle lands worth &pound;100 on the couple&#151;he conveyed estates worth 40 marks in 1379, and lands in Brough in 1383. By then Thomas Clifford had entered public life. On 26 October 1379 his father, preparing to go to Ireland, and presumably wishing to ensure that his Cumbrian retainers had Clifford leadership in the event of a Scottish invasion, made an indenture with John Lowther, under which Lowther was to wait upon Thomas, and take him to battle should war break out.<br>
<br>At that date Thomas Clifford had also started to attend the court&#151;on 4 May 1379 he secured a pardon for a Yorkshireman's killer. In October 1382 he was one of three &#145;king's kinsmen and young knights&#146; licensed to hunt in the royal forests  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1381&#150;5</i>, 176), and in December that year he was described as one of the king's chamber knights. On 23 October 1385 he received an annual grant of 200 marks, which was converted first into the custody of four manors in the south-west, and then, on 9 January 1387, into the keepership of the forests north of the Trent. Clifford was not allowed, probably did not wish, to forget his northern interests. On 16 December 1384 he was granted the custody of Carlisle Castle for life&#151;an office he shared with John Neville (<i>d</i>. 1388)&#151;and in March 1386 he was appointed a warden of the west march. When the appellants took power at the end of 1387, Thomas Clifford was one of a number of Richard II's friends who were ordered to leave the court, with the proviso that they be ready to appear before the next parliament. If Clifford did leave, he soon returned, since in September 1388 he was master of the king's horses, and was again described as a chamber knight in May 1389.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, on 13 July, Clifford's father died. Aged twenty-six, Thomas was the only Clifford to succeed to his peerage title as an adult before 1523. On 9 October he reaped the benefits of royal favour when he was pardoned the relief due from his lands. On 6 December he was summoned to parliament as a peer. Thomas Clifford was a warlike and adventurous man. In July 1386 he had challenged Sir Jacques de Boucicault, a notable practitioner of chivalry, to joust; in 1387 he was licensed to perform feats of arms in the Anglo-Scottish borders; in 1388 he jousted at Calais. In 1390 (presumably between 26 May and 16 June, dates on which he is recorded in England) he took part in the international tournament held at St Inglevert near Calais, &#145;honourably and valorously&#146;, according to Froissart  (Froissart, 2.436), and another French chronicle also describes him as participating in the crusade against Mahdiyya in north Africa later that year. By the end of 1390 he was back in England, and he was at Skipton on 19 January 1391. He was already planning to go abroad again, for on 11 January it was granted that should Clifford die overseas, his attorneys were to have the profits from his estates for a year to pay his debts.<br>
<br>In the middle of February 1391 Clifford set off for the Baltic, with other young English nobles. During the summer, while he was at K&ouml;nigsberg, he became involved in a quarrel with Sir William Douglas, an illegitimate son of the earl of Douglas. The two men were old adversaries. Their families had been at feud since 1298, when Edward I granted the Douglas lands in Scotland to the first Lord Clifford. It was doubtless in connection with this that some time before 1390 Clifford challenged Douglas to combat, and that on 6 June 1390 Douglas received a safe conduct to come to England for a suit against Clifford in the English military court. Their encounter in K&ouml;nigsberg led to a furious brawl in the city streets in which Douglas was killed. Clifford seems to have been overcome by remorse, for he set off for Jerusalem and died on the way there, on an unidentified Mediterranean island, in a state of deep penitence. The exact date is uncertain&#151;English sources favour 4 October 1391.<br>
<br>Thomas Clifford had apparently been a happily married man&#151;he was later referred to by his widow, who lived until 26 March 1424, as &#145;my most dear lord and husband&#146;  (books of record, 2.329). They had two children, a son, John Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1422), aged two at his father's death, who succeeded to the lordship, and a daughter, Maud, who was married successively to John Neville, Lord Latimer, from whom she was divorced, and to Richard, earl of Cambridge, executed for treason in 1415. Maud lived until 1446, and remembered her nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5663/', "Thomas Clifford")</script>, and great-nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5654/', "John Clifford")</script>, in her will.<br>
