</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  Malcolm</span>  (1885&#150;1948), <span class="occ">holder of land and water speed records</span>, was born on 11 March 1885 at Chislehurst, Kent, the only son and elder of two children of William Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1920), diamond merchant, of Cheapside, and his wife, Ada Westerton. He was educated at a preparatory school near Guildford, and then at Uppingham School, but left at the age of sixteen to continue his studies&#151;primarily to become a fluent linguist&#151;in France and Germany. It was in Germany that he began a lifelong eagerness to test himself, and machines, to see how fast he could go. His first sporting pursuit was bicycle racing; as a youth he was fined 30<i>s</i>. for driving a pedal cycle at 27 m.p.h. &#145;to the confusion and terror of two elderly ladies&#146;. He graduated from racing bicycles to taking part in motorcycle trials and earned three gold medals in the London&#150;Edinburgh trials of 1906, 1907, and 1908.<br>
<br>In 1906, aged twenty-one, Campbell became an underwriting member of Lloyd's and acquired the financial resources to develop his racing enthusiasms. He spotted the market for insuring newspapers against libel actions and built up a good and profitable business. He was a pioneer of aviation; as an innovative designer and engineer his aerial advances were more significant than those achieved in his land and sea speed quests. In 1909 he built a monoplane following a blueprint of his own that borrowed from the successful &#145;Bl&eacute;riot XI&#146; aeroplane. The plane, built in a disused barn in a strawberry field, flew in a straight line&#151;then crashed. Campbell's career was punctuated by a series of near disasters and spectacular crashes, as he literally drove himself to the limits of physical and technological performance. In an interview quoted in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> of 2 January 1949, he observed, &#145;If I break my neck then I'm unlucky. It's just a great adventure.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1910 Campbell immersed himself in the Brooklands motor track racing subculture. His first racing car was a Peugeot called &#145;The Flapper&#146; after a successful racehorse. However, his Flapper vehicles did not perform well. In 1912 he started using the moniker <i>Blue Bird</i> for his racing cars, inspired by the play of that name by Maurice Maeterlinck, and he continued to use that name as a lucky talisman for the rest of his life. During a 1912 Brooklands race he brushed with death as <i>Blue Bird</i> (a 1906 Darracq) lost wheels, swerved, and nearly flipped over. Such was his skill and presence of mind that he steered the shuddering, clanking <i>Blue Bird</i> to a fourth place finish. Before the First World War he drove Lion Peugeot, Renault, Schneider, Sunbeam, Charron, and Gregoire cars, as well as Darracqs. He embarked on the first of his three marriages on 19 July 1913, when he married Marjorie Dagmar Knott (<i>b</i>. 1892/3), daughter of Henry Raglan Knott, gentleman. They separated and the marriage was dissolved.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Campbell enlisted as a motorcycle rider and was commissioned in the West Kent regiment. He was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, where he was a ferry pilot and then a flying instructor. On demobilization, with the rank of captain and an MBE, he returned to Lloyd's and also established a motor car dealership. In March 1920 he married Dorothy Evelyn, daughter of Major William Whittall, with whom he had a son (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37259/', "Donald Malcolm Campbell")</script>) and a daughter. Recalling his impulsive temperament and his string of affairs during their twenty-year marriage, Dorothy Campbell thought him &#145;quite unfitted for the role of husband and family man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Malcolm Campbell: the Man as I Knew Him</span>, 1951, 222). Motor-racing continued to be his chief interest and in the post-war years he won over 400 trophies, including the 200 mile race at Brooklands in 1927 and 1928, and the Boulogne grand prix in 1927, driving a variety of cars, including a 7.6 litre GP Peugeot, a collection of Talbots (1.5 to 4.5 litre), an Austro-Daimler, and a 5 litre Sunbeam.<br>
<br>Always spurred on by an energetic fascination to test himself and his newest racing gadget, Campbell decided in 1922 to make a bid for the land speed record and took on Leo Villa as his racing mechanic. His first attempt, driving a 350 horse power Sunbeam at Saltburn in 1922, was unsuccessful, and this was followed by two failures at the international speed trial meetings at Fan&ouml;e, Denmark, in 1923 and 1924. Later in 1924 (on 25 September), however, driving the same vehicle at Pendine (Pen-tywyn) Sands, Carmarthenshire, he set a record of 146.16 m.p.h., and in the following year (21 July 1925) at Pendine became the first person to travel at over 150 m.p.h., setting a new record of 150.87 m.p.h.<br>
<br>From 1926 the rivalry between Campbell and Henry Segrave in turn established Britain at the forefront of land speed record attempts. Driving a new Napier-Campbell <i>Blue Bird</i>, Campbell pushed the record to 174.88 at Pendine on 4 February 1927, but at the end of March Segrave beat him to break the 200 m.p.h. barrier. Campbell responded by rebuilding <i>Blue Bird</i> and recording 206.95 m.p.h. at Daytona Beach, Florida, on 19 February 1928. This was subsequently broken by the American Ray Keech and then by Segrave. Campbell made an attempt to beat Segrave's record at Verneuk Pan, South Africa, in May 1929, but this proved a costly failure.<br>
<br>Campbell finally overhauled Segrave's record at Daytona on 5 February 1931, when he reached 231.4 m.p.h. in a rebuilt <i>Blue Bird</i>. On his triumphal return to London he received a knighthood. Successive attempts at Daytona pushed the record to 253.97 (24 February 1932), 272.46 (22 February 1933), and 276.88 (7 March 1935). Propelled by a Rolls-Royce &#145;R&#146; engine, delivering 2350 brake horse power, he achieved his ninth and last land speed record on 3 September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, where he became the first driver to exceed 300 m.p.h. with a speed of 301.13 m.p.h. His achievements were later (1940) recognized when he was awarded the trophy founded in memory of Segrave.<br>
<br>On his return from Daytona, Campbell, who believed that rearmament in the face of the German threat had become an urgent necessity, regarded it as his patriotic duty to enter politics. At the general election held in November 1935 he stood as a Conservative for the Deptford constituency but was beaten by the Labour candidate. As well as writing a number of books on motoring, and an account of his expedition in 1926 to the Cocos Islands in (fruitless) search of buried pirate treasure, he was motoring correspondent of <span class="italic">The Field</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Campbell took to the water with a <i>Blue Bird</i> motor boat designed by F. W. Cooper, powered by a Rolls-Royce aero engine. At Lake Maggiore, Switzerland, he set successive records of 126.33 m.p.h. and 129.5 m.p.h. in September 1937, achieving 130.93 at Halwill, Switzerland, in July 1938. In August 1939 he achieved his last record, 141.74 m.p.h., at Coniston Water.<br>
<br>During the early part of the Second World War, Campbell commanded a motorcycle unit and served for the remainder on the staff of combined operations, though he was frustrated not to be allowed to serve abroad with his regiment. After his second marriage was dissolved in 1940, he married on 16 August 1945 Betty Nicory (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), the divorced wife of Clement Nicory, and daughter of Sir John Humphery, company director. They separated within weeks and were divorced a year later. Campbell died at his home, Little Gatton, Reigate, Surrey, on 31 December 1948. His son succeeded him as a land and water speed record breaker.<br>
