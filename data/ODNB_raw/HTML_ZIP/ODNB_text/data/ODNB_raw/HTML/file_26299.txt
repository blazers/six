<span class="headword">Stapleton, Sir  Brian</span>  (<em>c.</em>1322&#150;1394), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, of Wighill and Helaugh, Yorkshire, was the third son of Sir Gilbert Stapleton (<i>d</i>. 1321) and his wife, Agnes 
    (or Matilda; 1297/8&#150;1348)
  , daughter and coheir of Brian, Lord Fitzalan (<i>d</i>. 1306), of Bedale in the same county. His father prospered in the service of Edward II to become escheator north of the Trent; and until their line died out in 1373 his kinsmen, the lords Stapleton, were summoned as barons to parliament. Yet, despite these influential connections, Brian Stapleton's immediate prospects of inheritance were slight, and he made both his name and his early fortune as a soldier in France. He probably first saw action in 1340, in the royal army at the siege of Tournai; the testimony that he gave much later, in 1386, during a dispute involving his friend, Richard, Lord Scrope of Bolton, begins at this point in his military career. Since, in his own words, he subsequently took part in &#145;all the great battles and expeditions&#146; of Edward III's reign  (Nicolas, 1.104), including the siege of Calais in 1347, it may be assumed that, like his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26302/', "Sir Miles Stapleton")</script> (a founder member of the Order of the Garter), he also fought at Cr&eacute;cy in the previous year.<br>
<br>Perhaps Stapleton did battle under the banner of his chief patron, William Montagu, earl of Salisbury, whom he accompanied to France in 1359 and later served with great loyalty. Although, in 1369, he enlisted with Edmund of Langley, earl of Cambridge, in the expeditionary force sent to relieve Edward, the Black Prince, in Aquitaine, his association with Salisbury soon assumed paramount importance. In 1373, for example, he sailed with him in the fleet that attacked the coast of Brittany; and it was through him, as governor of Calais, that in February 1380 he became, first, captain of Calais Castle and comptroller of the town, and then, within a matter of days, captain of Gu&icirc;nes. Some years earlier Stapleton had witnessed a treaty with the Bretons, and now he himself became a diplomatic envoy, chiefly for the negotiation of a truce with France. While these talks were progressing, in May 1380, Salisbury granted him and his heirs the manors of Bamburgh in Lincolnshire and Bampton in Cumberland, along with other estates in the north-west and in Suffolk, all out of gratitude for faithful service.<br>
<br>Stapleton had already become a landowner of note, partly through his marriage, by 1360, to Agnes, the widow of Stephen Waleys (<i>d</i>. 1350) of Helaugh, who brought him extensive property in Yorkshire. Then, on the death of his kinsman Thomas Stapleton in 1373, an entail brought Sir Brian more land in Yorkshire as well as the manor of Kentmere in Westmorland. Later on he consolidated his holdings by buying Wighill and Quarmby, near Huddersfield, probably investing the booty won on campaigns overseas. Stapleton was made a knight of the Garter in 1382; in the following year he and the earl of Salisbury escorted Richard II's young bride, Anne of Bohemia, to Calais; and in 1383 he held a muster there of the troops led by Bishop Despenser on his abortive &#145;crusade&#146; against the Flemings. After a fairly successful round of negotiations with embassies from France and Flanders, leading to the truce of Leulinghen, Stapleton returned home. His diplomatic skills were employed on the Scottish border in 1386 and 1388, during which time he was both a commissioner to take evidence and a witness in Lord Scrope's celebrated quarrel with Sir Robert Grosvenor over a contested coat of arms.<br>
<br>Appropriately enough, one of Stapleton's last public appearances was in 1390 at a tournament staged by the knights of the Garter in London. His reputation in the lists seems to have been formidable, and stories about his exploits were still circulating two centuries later. By then, however, they had become the stuff of legend, describing how he &#145;slew a saryson [Saracen] in plane batell in the presence of three kings&#146;  (Chetwynd-Stapylton, 120), and even how he deposited St Mary Magdalen's right hand in the Dominican friary at York (with which he had no known connection, but where his grandson was buried). He died on 25 July 1394, having requested a lavish funeral, at which his armour and helm were to be displayed by a &#145;well favoured&#146; man-at-arms on horseback. He was buried, according to his wishes, beside his wife at Park Priory in Helaugh. Brian Stapleton, his young grandson, succeeded him, and fell near Alen&ccedil;on in 1417, fighting in the retinue of Thomas Montagu, earl of Salisbury.<br>
