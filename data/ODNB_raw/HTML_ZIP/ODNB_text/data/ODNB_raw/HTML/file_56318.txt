<span class="headword">Betts,  Annie Dorothy</span>  (1884&#150;1961), <span class="occ">apiculturist and expert on bee diseases</span>, was born on 22 November 1884 at Claverley, Adelaide Road, Surbiton, Surrey, the daughter of Edward Peto Betts (1844&#150;1918), civil engineer and financier, and his wife, Frances Ashenhurst Maclean (1853&#150;1934). She was from a distinguished family of railway constructors that included her grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49433/', "Edward Ladd Betts (1815&#150;1872)")</script> and her great-uncle Sir (Samuel) Morton Peto (1809&#150;1889). Little is known of her education, but she gained an external London BSc degree in 1906.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Annie Betts engaged in aeronautical research on variable pitch airscrews, and, although she did not pursue a paid career thereafter, she was a lifelong member of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and published a paper, &#145;The effect of variable gearing on aeroplane performance&#146;, in the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span> in November 1923. Suffering from a progressive loss of hearing, she became a very private person. Little is known of her domestic life except that she lived in the family home at Camberley, Surrey, until early 1935, after her mother's death, and later in Horsham, Sussex.<br>
<br>Annie Betts kept bees from her teens, when she and her father were both members of the Surrey Beekeepers Association. Her notebooks, written between 1908 and 1924, show her early interest in the pollen loads of the honey bee and in practical bee anatomy. Her primary interest was in the field of bee diseases; she published her first paper in this area in 1912 in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>. An extended version, &#145;The fungi of the beehive&#146;, subsequently appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of Economic Biology</span>.<br>
<br>Annie Betts was a regular and esteemed contributor to journals on bee-keeping, and was appointed editor of <span class="italic">Bee World</span> in 1929. She established the journal's position as the leading international apicultural magazine, and made it a source of inspiration to both scientists and progressive bee-keepers. Her skills as a linguist allowed her to maintain a trans-European correspondence during the inter-war period; she mastered Russian in order to extend the scope of her coverage of apicultural literature. Under her editorship <span class="italic">Bee World</span> opened up European apicultural science to the English-speaking world. She was rigorous in her assessment of her own work, as well as that of others, and willingly acknowledged her own misunderstandings. If the management of a small voluntary journal's finances and production was difficult in the inter-war period, the Second World War brought material shortages and unimaginable problems to an editor dependent on overseas correspondents. She was, however, able to maintain links between nations.<br>
<br>Alongside <span class="italic">Bee World</span>, Annie Betts built up the Apis Club Library, and then oversaw this important collection's transfer, with the journal, to the Bee Research Association (subsequently based at Cardiff as the International Bee Research Association). Her self-effacement was typified by a firm decline of any form of testimonial: when relinquishing her editorship in 1949, she said in her concluding <span class="italic">Bee World</span> editorial that she looked forward to doing things of interest outside the world of apiculture, including motorcyling.<br>
<br>Annie Betts died on 8 September 1961 at 43 The Broadway, Knaphill, Woking, Surrey. A bibliography of her works which appeared in <span class="italic">Bee World</span> after her death revealed the full extent of her voluminous output. She wrote two books, <span class="italic">Practical Bee Anatomy</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">The Diseases of Bees</span> (1935; later edn, 1951), and published more than 145 articles on various aspects of apiculture.<br>
