<span class="headword">Gaikwar <span class="st"> [Gaekwar]</span>, Sayaji Rao</span> <span class="st"> [Sayaji Rao III]</span>, maharaja of Baroda  (1863&#150;1939), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 11 March 1863 at Kavlana in Nasik district of Bombay presidency, and named Gopal Rao, the second son of Kashi Rao, a village headman, who belonged to the Maratha family which had created the state of Baroda in Gujarat during the eighteenth century. After the British government of India had deposed Maharaja Malhar Rao as ruler of Baroda in 1875 for misconduct (which reputedly included attempting to poison the British resident with diamond dust) and misgovernment, the maharani, Jamnabai (1863&#150;1898), widow of his brother and predecessor, was permitted to adopt a collateral relative as heir. Her choice was the twelve-year-old Gopal Rao, who took the name Sayaji Rao III when he was installed on the <i>gadi</i> or throne of Baroda in May 1875. F. A. H. Elliott, an Indian Civil Service officer and member of the Minto family which had a long tradition of imperial service in India, was appointed as tutor for the new heir and established a rigorous regime of literary education in English, Gujarati, Marathi, and Urdu as well as practical training in administration. At the same time, the British government of India secured the appointment of Sir T. Madhav Rao, a Maratha administrator reputed to be both progressive and loyal to the British, as <i>diwan</i> or chief minister. During the minority of the young prince, the <i>diwan</i> reformed the court system and state police while building schools, hospitals, and roads, and achieving a balanced budget.<br>
<br>Invested with governing powers in December 1881, shortly before his nineteenth birthday, Sayaji Rao, short, stocky, and socially reserved, was an administratively active ruler. He soon earned a reputation as a model prince for his attention to duty and social programmes. His first priority was to make educational institutions available in all segments of his state of about 8000 square miles, which consisted of four provinces dispersed within the Gujarat and Kathiawar areas of the British Indian province of Bombay and had a population of slightly more than 2 million (1881). In 1893 free compulsory primary education was inaugurated in Amreli district as an experiment; in 1907 it was extended throughout Baroda state. Although the legal sanctions against parents who did not send their children to school were not strictly enforced, especially during periods of famine or floods when parents found it difficult to withdraw their children from economic production, the positive effect of this initiative was reflected in higher literacy rates in Baroda than in the surrounding Bombay presidency by 1921. Sayaji Rao viewed education as a precondition for effective social changes and developed a comprehensive library system, including mobile units in rural areas, to reinforce classroom instruction. A second concern was to enhance the legal rights of women through legislation such as the <span class="roman">Hindu Widow Marriage Act</span> in 1902, the <span class="roman">Infant Marriage Prevention Act</span> in 1904, and the <span class="roman">Hindu Divorce Act</span> in 1930. A third focus was to end discrimination based on caste status. Institutional provisions for depressed castes, the so-called untouchables, included special scholarships, schools, and hostels, and the maharaja himself undertook a public relations campaign, speaking at many public functions of associations both within his state and in India advocating changes in social attitudes. In the tradition of princely patronage he granted scholarships to B. R. Ambedkar, the prominent scheduled caste leader, to study in India and later law at Columbia University.<br>
<br>Reflecting his commoner birth and later education, Sayaji Rao was a complex synthesis of populist and paternal autocrat. To staff his administration and educational institutions he recruited talented Indian nationalists as well as bureaucrats. They ranged from Romesh Chander Dutt, an Indian Civil Service officer who formulated the theory that the British drained India of its economic resources, to Aurobindo Ghose, eventually a mentor to radical Bengali students. In 1908 the ruler inaugurated a legislative council (Dhara Sabha) which was mainly advisory and had no budgetary oversight. Desirous of being a modernizer while still retaining his authority, he promoted social mobility and political consultation but not political responsibility or democracy among his subjects.<br>
<br>Sayaji Rao's relations with the British government of India followed a tortuous path. He owed his <i>gadi</i> to British policy which, after the uprising of 1857, was to refrain from annexing princely states where there was no natural heir. After his installation he was carefully groomed to be an enlightened ruler and socialized into British imperial culture, beginning with his presentation to the prince of Wales (later Edward VII) during his Indian tour in 1875 and his participation in the imperial durbar in 1877 in Delhi. In order to relieve health problems reputedly brought on by overwork and variously described as neurasthenia or nervous prostration, sleeplessness, and gout, he made his first trip to England in 1887 despite the spiritual and social ostracization which orthodox Hindus then endured after crossing the ocean. Received by Queen Victoria, he was viewed as an exemplary imperial collaborator. However, as he sought greater personal and public autonomy, points of tension arose with the imperial authorities. Plagued by continuing ill health and curious about modern institutions abroad, he extended his stays in England, where he purchased several residences including the former home of Lord Tennyson at Aldworth in Sussex, near Haslemere (Surrey), during the 1890s. His absences from Baroda were one factor leading the viceroy, Lord Curzon, in 1900 to order that Indian princes seek viceregal permission before leaving their states. On a personal level, Sayaji Rao deeply resented this imperial interference, while his continued employment of Indian critics of the British and toleration within his territory of presses that published material which the British deemed seditious caused some British officials to question his loyalty. This friction reached a climax in 1911 when he allegedly insulted George V at the imperial durbar in Delhi by turning his back on the king&#150;emperor while walking away after being presented. The British and Indian press debated his motives, and some called for his deposition. Sayaji Rao apologized, and his relations with the British improved as he generously supported Britain during the First World War. Appointed GCSI in 1887, he became GCIE in 1919.<br>
<br>After 1919 Sayaji Rao travelled and lived in Europe and Britain for several months each year. Capable <i>diwans</i>, especially Sir Manubhai Mehta (1916&#150;26) and Sir V. T. Krishnamachari (1926&#150;44), oversaw a centralized administration which implemented social and economic reforms, including industrial projects, and acquiesced in controlled demonstrations of popular support for Indian nationalists, especially Mahatma Gandhi. Recognized as an elder statesman among the Indian princes, Sayaji Rao participated in the first and second round-table conferences on constitutional reform in London during the early 1930s, when the princes enunciated their support for a federation with British Indian provinces. During the first round-table conference his dinner with a scheduled caste guest at his West End hotel occasioned perhaps even more publicity than his speeches.<br>
<br>The maharaja was married twice: first on 6 January 1880 to Lakshmibai (<i>c</i>.1864&#150;1885), daughter of Haibatrao Mohite, of the Maratha princely family of Tanjore, who took the name of Chimnabai. They had one son (who predeceased the maharaja) and two daughters before Chimnabai's death on 7 May 1885. On 28 December 1885 he married Gajrabai (1871&#150;1958), daughter of Bajirao Amritrao Ghatge, subsequently named Chimnabai II, from a branch of the Maratha Ghatge family settled in Dewas state. In 1914 Chimnabai II publicly ceased to observe purdah in Baroda after returning from her tenth trip to Europe, co-authored with S. M. Mitra <span class="italic">The Position of Women in Indian Life</span> (1911), and was the first president of the All India Women's Conference in 1927. The couple had three sons (the elder two predeceased their father), and one daughter, who became the maharani of Cooch Behar and a well-known hostess in London during the 1920s and 1930s.<br>
<br>After spending most of the 1930s travelling to seek relief for health problems at various European spas, Sayaji Rao III returned to India in November 1938. Too ill to travel to Baroda, he died in Bombay on 6 February 1939 of a heart attack complicated by uraemia; his remains were cremated the following day in Baroda. He was succeeded by Pratapsinh, his grandson from the son of his first marriage.<br>
