<span class="headword">Collins,  Charles Allston</span>  (1828&#150;1873), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born on 25 January 1828 at Pond Street, Hampstead, Middlesex, the second son of the landscape and genre painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5959/', "William John Thomas Collins RA (1788&#150;1847)")</script> and his wife, Harriet Geddes (1790&#150;1868), a teacher and writer, daughter of Lieutenant Alexander Geddes and his wife, Harriet Easton. Geddes's sister was the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4732/', "Margaret Carpenter")</script>. Born, according to Percy Fitzgerald's <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Author</span>, &#145;a blue-eyed red-haired bonny bairn&#146;  (Fitzgerald, 1.297), he was named after his godfather Washington Allston (1779&#150;1843), the American history painter. Charles's eldest brother, to whom he was very close, was the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5961/', "William Wilkie Collins")</script>. Collins grew up in the Hampstead, Highgate, and Bayswater areas of London where his neighbours included the landscape painter John Linnell and his family. Collins was tutored at home by his mother. Like his father, subject to depression, he too became exceedingly religious and adopted high-church practices.<br>
<br>In 1843 Charles Collins entered the Royal Academy Schools where he formed lasting friendships with William Holman Hunt and especially John Everett Millais, and met other members of what subsequently became the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. However, in spite of Millais's nomination, the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825&#150;1892) later blocked Collins's election to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Collins and Millais spent the summer of 1850 painting in Oxfordshire and between September and November stayed at the home of the printer Thomas Combe in Walton Street, Oxford. There Millais drew a portrait of his friend, whom he nicknamed Saint Carlo, depicting a nervous, anxious, chiselled face with high eyebrows and large eyes. Millais presented this portrait to Combe, and it later formed part of the Combe bequest to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Collins's evident nervous temperament may have been aggravated by an accident five years earlier in which he nearly drowned. As a result Collins was petrified by water. Millais wrote, &#145;One could not induce him to commit his body (for fear of drowning) within a coffin bath of hot water&#146;  (Peters, 105). At Oxford, Collins painted a portrait of Mrs Combe's uncle, William Bennett, which, as Malcolm Warner has observed, was probably intended as a pendant to Millais's portrait of the printer (both Ashmolean Museum, Oxford); both works were presented by the artists to Combe. It was also probably during this time that Collins began his most famous work, <span class="italic">Convent Thoughts</span> (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851. It was purchased by Combe and formed part of his growing collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. A powerful painting, it depicts a young nun, probably a novice, standing in an enclosed garden holding a passion flower, the symbol of the crucifixion. In her other hand is an illuminated medieval book. Part of her shadow is glimpsed in the lily pond before her. In common with other works by the Pre-Raphaelites, Collins's painting was attacked and parodied. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, on 7 May 1851, accused them of Catholic tendencies, an &#145;absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade&#146;, and attacked their strangeness and use of form. Ruskin, in letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 13 and 30 May 1851, vigorously defended the artists and praised Collins's painting for its meticulous attention to botanical detail.<br>
<br>Other works from the 1850s include <span class="italic">Berengaria's Alarm</span> (exh. 1850; Manchester City Galleries), the challenging and highly original <span class="italic">May in the Regent's Park</span> (1852; Tate collection), and <span class="italic">Good Harvest of '54</span> (1855; V&amp;A). Collins's exceptional skills as a portrait painter are seen in <span class="italic">Georgina Hogarth as &#145;Lady Grace&#146;</span> (1855) in his brother's drama <span class="italic">The Lighthouse</span> (1855). This portrait is noteworthy for the depiction of its subject's startling eyes and intense pupils. He was represented at the 1857 Pre-Raphaelite exhibition at Russell Place by <span class="italic">The Long Engagement</span> and <span class="italic">The Fuchsia</span>, both of which have disappeared from view. However, Millais and other contemporaries observed that Collins often failed to follow through his ideas, leaving drawings and paintings half-finished. William Holman Hunt noted in his <span class="italic">Pre-Raphaelitism</span> that the talented and idealistic Collins:<blockquote>could have held the field for us had he done himself justice in design and possessed courage to keep his purpose &hellip; he continually lost heart when any painting had progressed half-way toward completion, abandoning it for a new subject, and this vacillation he indulged until he had a dozen or more unfinished canvases never to be completed. (Hunt, 2.314)</blockquote>In a letter of 1855, Charles Collins confessed to Holman Hunt &#145;the extreme suffering and anxiety which painting causes me&#146;  (Hunt MSS, Hunt. L.). Whenever he tried to paint, he had acute stomach pains. In 1857 he gave up painting and attempted to make a living as a writer. Introduced by his elder brother to Charles Dickens and his circle, Collins contributed both fiction and non-fiction to <span class="italic">Household Words</span> (1858&#150;9), the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> (Dec 1867 &#150; March 1868), and <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> (1860&#150;66). Most of his writing appears in Dickens's <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, including his first book, <span class="italic">The New Sentimental Journey</span> (1859), sketches of his Parisian visits, which was published in parts between 11 June and 9 July 1859. <span class="italic">The Eye Witness and his Evidence of many Wonderful Things</span> (1860) is an anthology of all twenty-one of his &#145;Our eye-witness&#146; accounts. <span class="italic">A cruise upon wheels: the chronicle of some autumn wanderings among the deserted post-roads of France</span> was published in 1862. He wrote three novels: <span class="italic">The Bar Sinister: a Tale</span> (1864); <span class="italic">Strathcairn</span> (1864); and <span class="italic">At the Bar: a Tale</span> (1866). Wilkie Collins, writing his brother's entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, believed that Charles's prose writings showed &#145;rare ability in the presentation of character &hellip; gave promise of achievement in the future, never destined to be fulfilled&#146;.<br>
<br>Collins married Katherine Elizabeth (Kate) Macready (1839&#150;1929), the youngest daughter of Charles Dickens, on 17 July 1860, at Gad's Hill. There were no children. The couple lived in France and London. Collins wrote to his mother that in London &#145;we are paupers&#151;abroad we are rich&#146;  (Peters, 231). Increasingly he and Kate became estranged. Kate said after Collins's death that she had wished to obtain a legal separation but her father was opposed to it. G. H. Fleming, the biographer of Millais, bluntly describes the reason for the disintegration of the marriage: &#145;Charles Collins was incurably impotent&#146;  (Fleming, 190). His brother Wilkie wrote in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, &#145;The last years of [Charles's] life were years of broken health and acute suffering, borne with a patience and courage known only to those nearest and dearest to him.&#146; Just before his own death, Charles Dickens encouraged Collins to illustrate <span class="italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</span> (1870).<br>
<br>On 9 April 1873 Charles died at 10 Thurloe Place, South Kensington, aged forty-five, from a cancerous tumour in the stomach. He was buried in Brompton cemetery on Monday 13 April 1873 in a grave covered by a flat granite slab without text or an inscription. His widow, Kate, observed an obligatory year of mourning before remarrying another painter, Charles Edward Perugini (1839&#150;1918). As Wilkie Collins remarked, &#145;it was in the modest and sensitive nature of the man to underrate his own success. His ideal was a high one; and he never succeeded in satisfying his own aspirations&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
