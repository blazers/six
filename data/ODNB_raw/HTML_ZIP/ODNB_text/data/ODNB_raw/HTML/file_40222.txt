<span class="headword">Gretton,  John</span>, first Baron Gretton  (1867&#150;1947), <span class="occ">brewer and politician</span>, was born on 1 September 1867 at Bladen House, Winshill, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, the eldest of the three sons and five daughters of John Gretton (1833&#150;1899), of Bladen House, Winshill, Staffordshire, and Grantham Lodge, Cowes, Isle of Wight, and his wife, Marianne Louisa (1847&#150;1891), the daughter of Major John Richard Molineux (1817&#150;1902). His father, who left an estate worth &pound;2,883,640, was a director of England's leading brewery, Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton, of Burton upon Trent. Having leased Sudbury Hall, Derbyshire, from Lord Vernon in the late 1890s, Gretton inherited Stapleford Park, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, the ancestral home of Lord Harborough bought by his father in 1894, and a great house in Knightsbridge, London.<br>
<br>After education at Harrow School, Gretton went to work in the brewery at the age of about twenty. In 1893 he joined the board, and was soon crucial in political resistance to the temperance movement. He was diligent rather than keenly entrepreneurial, and in 1909 he succeeded Michael Arthur Bass, first Baron Burton, as chairman of Bass, Ratcliff and Gretton. The brewery paid dividends of 30 per cent in 1896&#150;7 and remained superbly profitable throughout Gretton's chairmanship: average annual dividends on ordinary shares typically exceeded 20 per cent throughout the period 1934&#150;45. Gretton was too conservative and complacent about the excellence of his products to develop forward strategies, however, and competition from Worthington's bottled beers troubled the firm from about 1900. Antagonism existed at all levels between the two companies; nevertheless, in 1926 Gretton agreed a merger with Arthur Manners, his counterpart at Worthington. But the two companies were left unintegrated, so that the anticipated benefits of this huge merger were never achieved. Manners always proved more astute and ruthless in boardroom politics than Gretton, whose resignation as chairman he provoked in 1945.<br>
<br>Despite his Quaker descent, Gretton joined the Staffordshire volunteer regiment when young and maintained a lifelong devotion to soldiering. Known as &#145;Colonel&#146; Gretton, he commanded the 6th battalion of the North Staffordshires (1900&#150;07), and was their honorary colonel (1912&#150;32). Military recruitment, training, and inspection consumed his energies in 1914&#150;18.<br>
<br>Gretton was an archetype of the reactionary tory brewer. For forty-eight years he was a Conservative MP, representing successively South Derbyshire (1895&#150;1906), Rutland (1907&#150;18), and Burton upon Trent (1918&#150;43). As a protectionist he testified to the tariff commission (1903); he was an implacable opponent of the <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span> (1908) and of government restrictions on the wartime drinks trade. Lord Balniel characterized him in 1910:<blockquote>One of the best-hearted fellows one has ever met, kind, generous, self-effacing: ugly as possible, blinking at one through gold-rimmed spectacles: inarticulate, for it is almost impossible to hear a word he says, and his handwriting is simply deplorable. He has all the noble qualities of the mole. (Vincent, 169)</blockquote>He hated the Lloyd George coalition, and resigned the tory whip (1921&#150;2) in protest at its Irish settlement, foreign policy, and budget &#145;squandermania&#146;. His inability to co-operate with Lord Salisbury, however, resulted in the leadership of the die-hard Unionists passing to Salisbury by the summer of 1922. Gretton, who sought the party chairmanship later in 1922, chaired the Unionist reconstruction committee (1920&#150;21) and the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations (1920&#150;29). He was a gloomy, stubborn, and suspicious politician but a sharp-eared gossip who often exasperated his party leaders by demanding &#145;reactionary policy that the country would not stand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Austen Chamberlain Diary</span>, 358).<br>
<br>After the Conservative defeat in 1929, Gretton mustered the die-hards against Baldwin, and as a leader of the India defence committee stood beside Churchill in a last-ditch fight against the <span class="roman">Government of India Bill</span> in 1931&#150;5. Cuthbert Headlam wrote of him in 1934:<blockquote>He is a terrible cripple nowadays and getting very old&#151;in the House he collapses into a heap snoring so loud that he almost disturbs a debate. It is odd that he has had so much influence in politics for he has no parliamentary ability&#151;and is not even an average speaker: presumably he is a clever intriguer. I like him. (Ball, 297)</blockquote>Gretton was a Derbyshire magistrate (1899), deputy lieutenant of Leicestershire (1929), a freeman of Burton upon Trent (1943), lord of the manor of Wymondham, and patron of five livings in Leicestershire, Rutland, and Staffordshire. He was created CBE in 1919, sworn of the privy council in 1926, and received a barony in 1944. In 1900 he married Maud Helen de Moleyns (1870&#150;1934), the fourth daughter of the fourth Baron Ventry; they had a son and two daughters. He died of hemiplegia and a cerebral thrombosis on 2 June 1947 at Stapleford Park, and was buried at Stapleford on 6 June.<br>
