<span class="headword">Vicars,  Hedley Shafto Johnstone</span>  (1826&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer and evangelical</span>, was born on 7 December 1826 in Mauritius, where his father, Richard Vicars (<i>d</i>. 1839), a captain in the Royal Engineers, was then stationed. After passing his examinations at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he received a commission in the 97th regiment on 22 December 1843, and in the following year proceeded to Corfu. On 6 November 1846 he obtained his lieutenancy. In 1848 his regiment was removed to Jamaica, and in 1851 to Canada. In November of that year he underwent an evangelical conversion which influenced the remainder of his life. He became a Sunday school teacher, visited the sick, and read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayed with the men of his company, a most unusual proceeding at that time. In 1852 he became adjutant of his regiment. In May 1853 the regiment returned to England, and in August he resigned the adjutancy. He became a frequent attendant of meetings held at Exeter Hall, a centre of London evangelicalism, and an active member of the Soldiers' Friendly Society, besides holding frequent religious meetings with railway navvies. Before his regiment left England for the Crimea, early in 1854, it was reported that &#145;since Mr. Vicars became so good, he has steadied about four hundred men in the regiment&#146;. At the Piraeus many men of the 97th died of cholera, and Vicars, while conducting the burial parties, took every opportunity of preaching to those at the graveside. On 3 November 1854 he was promoted to the rank of captain.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1854 Vicars landed in the Crimea, and, with his regiment, took part in the siege of Sevastopol. Here he continued his religious work, holding prayer meetings in his tent, visiting the sick in the hospitals, and carefully looking after his men. On the night of 22 March 1855, while he was in the trenches, the Russians made a sortie from Sevastopol, took the English by surprise, and drove them from their trenches. Vicars, keeping his men in hand, fired a volley into the enemy at twenty paces, and then, charging with the 97th, he drove the Russians back and regained possession of the trenches. He cut down two men with his own hand before he fell, bayoneted and shot through the right shoulder. He died shortly afterwards and was buried on the following day on the Vorontsov road, close to the milestone. In his dispatch on 6 April, Lord Raglan made special mention of Vicars's gallantry. Vicars became a posthumous hero, his deeds and his evangelicalism equally celebrated, notably in the best-seller by Catherine M. Marsh (published anonymously), <span class="italic">The Memorials of Captain Hedley Vicars</span> (1855). Evangelical meetings allowed Vicars to develop close relationships with private soldiers of a sort otherwise impossible in the class-stratified mid-Victorian army, and his example was for long an inspiration in the burgeoning military evangelical movement.<br>
