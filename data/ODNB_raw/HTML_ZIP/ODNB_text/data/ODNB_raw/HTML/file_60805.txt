<span class="headword">Dodds,  Madeleine Hope</span>  (1885&#150;1972), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 2 January 1885. She was the second of the five children (four daughters and one son) of Edwin Dodds (<i>d</i>. 1929) of Home House, Kells Lane, Low Fell, Gateshead, co. Durham, and his wife, Emily (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of John Mawson of Low Fell. Edwin ran a printing and stationery business on Quayside, Newcastle upon Tyne, which had been founded by his father, M. S. Dodds, in 1834. Hope attended Gateshead High School for Girls and went to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1904. She was awarded second-class honours in each part of the history tripos in 1906 and 1907. She spent a further year at Newnham researching for a thesis on the boroughs of the bishops of Durham which won the Creighton memorial prize in 1909. Women were not allowed to graduate at Cambridge until 1948, and in 1949 Hope took her MA. She was an associate of Newnham from 1945 until 1958.<br>
<br>Dodds's thesis derived from work which she began in 1907 for the Durham volumes in the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span>. Newnham had established a link for its students with the <span class="roman">Victoria history</span>. Anxious to secure a fourth year at Cambridge, Hope wrote in June 1907 to the general editor of the <span class="roman">Victoria history</span>, William Page, asking whether he could provide her with a research project relating to Northumberland or co. Durham. Her tutor backed her request, and Page offered her paid work on his staff in London for as long as she wanted in order that she could gain some experience. She may have taken up the offer for a few weeks during the autumn. By October she was back at Newnham with a commission from Page to write the article on Darlington as an outside contributor at the rate of 1 guinea for every 1000 words, with a limit of around 5000 words. She submitted the article in August 1908. She went on to write several more articles, including those on Gateshead and Easington. Finally, in February 1913 Page commissioned her to write the article on Hartlepool and three shorter articles. The <span class="roman">Victoria history</span> was suspended nationally in 1916 because of the war but was revived in the early 1920s. Three of Hope's articles were at last published when volume 3 of the Durham <span class="roman">Victoria history</span> appeared in 1928. Work on the Durham history then ceased until the 1990s, but her unpublished articles remain part of its archives. Hope also found time to write, in collaboration with her younger sister Ruth, <span class="italic">The Pilgrimage of Grace, 1536&#150;7, and the Exeter Conspiracy, 1538</span>, a two-volume history begun by 1909 and published in 1915 (reprinted in 1971).<br>
<br>In October 1915 Hope joined Ruth in weekend work at the munitions factory at Elswick, near Newcastle. With labour short because of the war, they next worked in the family business: Ruth started that October and Hope and the youngest sister, Sylvia, by the following February. By July 1916 Hope was helping her father transcribe the register of All Saints', Newcastle, for the Durham and Northumberland Parish Register Society, which he was instrumental in founding, but she found the work dull. In 1920 she published extracts from the Newcastle corporation minute book 1639&#150;56 as the first volume of the publications of the Newcastle upon Tyne Records Committee. She followed it in 1923 with a further volume relating to the freemen of Newcastle. In 1922 the Northumberland County History Committee appointed her editor of the multi-volume history of Northumberland which had been in progress since the early 1890s. Between 1926 and 1940 she produced the final four volumes (12&#150;15), not only editing them but writing much of the contents. Other publications included contributions to various historical journals, notably <span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span>, published by the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries. She was a member of that society from 1908 and its librarian from 1941 until eye trouble forced her to resign in 1946. The society made her an honorary member in 1947.<br>
<br>Hope also had strong literary interests, including the history of English drama, and she published on literary as well as historical topics. She was an active member of the Progressive Players of Gateshead from the time of their foundation in 1920, and she provided much of the money for building the Gateshead Little Theatre, opened in 1943. When her eyesight failed towards the end of her life, she learned braille so as to be able still to read. In 1918 Hope and her sister Ruth started to attend Quaker meetings, and Hope had become a member of the Newcastle Society of Friends by the end of 1919. She was also a socialist and contributed to the monthly <span class="italic">Gateshead Labour News</span> (later the <span class="italic">Gateshead Herald</span>), of which the more politically active Ruth became editor in 1925.<br>
<br>Hope continued to live at Home House after her father's death in 1929, sharing it with Ruth and Sylvia. From 1940 to 1942 she also had a flat on the Isle of Wight, where her married sister Molly lived. Remembered as a quiet and retiring person but one who was full of gaiety and generosity, Hope died at Home House, 231 Kells Lane, Low Fell, Gateshead, on 13 May 1972.<br>
