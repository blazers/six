<span class="headword">Pelham,  Henry Thomas</span>, third earl of Chichester  (1804&#150;1886), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical commissioner</span>, the second, but eldest surviving, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21799/', "Thomas Pelham, second earl (1756&#150;1826)")</script>, and Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana Osborne (1776&#150;1862), daughter of the fifth duke of Leeds, was born in Stratton Street, Piccadilly, London, on 25 August 1804, and was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered as a nobleman in April 1822, taking no degree. On 24 April 1824 he entered the army as a cornet in the 6th dragoons, but, by the influence of the duke of Wellington, was able on 14 October of the same year to exchange into the Royal Horse Guards. He became lieutenant in 1827, captain (unattached) in January 1828, and major in the army in 1841. In 1844 he resigned his commission. He was afterwards an active supporter of the volunteer movement. In 1825 the duke of Newcastle invited him, without making any stipulation regarding Pelham's political principles, to accept his nomination for the parliamentary representation of the duke's borough of Newark, but Pelham succeeded to the earldom on 4 July 1826, before the election.<br>
<br>Chichester held whig opinions, but was not an ardent partisan. He was a strong evangelical who expressed his views temperately. He was deeply interested in religious, social, and educational questions. On 22 February 1841, just before the fall of the whig government, he was appointed an ecclesiastical commissioner, and on 30 January 1847 became a commissioner to report on the question of equalizing the pecuniary value of episcopal sees. When the church estates' committee was appointed in 1850 Chichester was made head of the board, with the title of first church estates' commissioner. He retained the position until October 1878, with a very heavy burden of work, and after his retirement from it continued to be an ecclesiastical commissioner. He was largely responsible for the important reforms carried out in the management and distribution of church revenues, and was the chief lay influence in the material reform and administration of the Church of England from the 1840s to the 1870s. Chichester was also for half a century president of the Church Missionary Society, and was connected with the Evangelical Alliance, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the Church of England Temperance Society. He was president of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1849. He was also interested in the management of prisons, becoming in 1843 a commissioner of Pentonville prison, and editing in 1863 Sir Joshua Jebb's <span class="italic">Reports and Observations on the Discipline and Management of Convict Prisons</span>. In spite of his evangelical views, he spoke on 16 July 1845 in support of the grant to endow the Roman Catholic college of Maynooth in Ireland. He was a regular attendant, and not infrequent speaker, in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Chichester was appointed lord lieutenant of Sussex on 21 November 1860, where he was very popular. He had married, on 18 August 1828, Lady Mary Brudenell, fifth daughter of the sixth earl of Cardigan, and his wife, Penelope Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke. She died on 22 May 1867, leaving four sons and three daughters. Chichester died at his seat, Stanmer Park, Sussex, on 15 March 1886. His eldest son, Walter John Pelham (1838&#150;1902), MP for Lewes from 1865 to 1874, succeeded to the title.<br>
