<span class="headword">Corner,  George Richard</span>  (1801&#150;1863), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born in the parish of Christ Church, Southwark, London, was the eldest of the six children of Richard Corner (<i>d</i>. 1820), a solicitor in Southwark, and Maria, daughter of James Brierley. He was educated at Gordon House, Kentish Town, and after having been admitted an attorney in 1824, followed his father's profession with success.<br>
<br>In 1828 Corner married Sarah, the youngest daughter of Timothy Leach of Clapham, with whom he had two sons and two daughters who survived him. About 1835 he was appointed vestry clerk of the parish of St Olave, Southwark, a parish in which he was greatly active, particularly during the 1832 cholera epidemic. On 28 November 1833 Corner was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and from this date published many antiquarian papers, often connected with the history of Southwark. Of these the best-known were <span class="italic">A Concise Account of the Local Government of the Borough of Southwark</span> (1836) and <span class="italic">The Rental of St. Olave and St. John Southwark</span> (1838, 1851). His first communication to the Society of Antiquaries was made on 9 January 1834, when he pointed out in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> the distinction, not previously recognized, between the three manors of Southwark. He contributed other papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> from 1835 to 1860, including &#145;An account of excavations on the site of Roman buildings at Keston, near Bromley, in Kent&#146; (vol. 36) and a paper on the abbot of Waltham's House, St Mary-at-Hill, London (vol. 36).<br>
<br>Corner was one of the original members of the Numismatic Society of London, founded in 1836, but apparently did not make a special study of coins. He left the society ten years later, in January 1846. He was also a member of the British Archaeological Association from the time of its establishment in 1843: he exhibited many antiquities before this society, and contributed accounts of them to its journal. Corner also showed great interest in the Archaeological Society of Surrey, and contributed to its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, as also to the <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span> (vol. 6), the <span class="italic">South London Journal</span> (1857), and the <span class="italic">Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica</span> (vols. 5, 7). He was also an occasional contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>In the last years of his life, Corner seems to have experienced &#145;difficulties occasioned &hellip; by family misfortunes&#146;. He died suddenly on 31 October 1863, at Queen's Row, Camberwell, where he resided, and was buried in Nunhead cemetery. His brother Arthur Bloxham Corner (<i>d</i>. 1861) was her majesty's coroner and attorney in the court of queen's bench. Another brother, Richard James Corner, was appointed chief justice of the Gold Coast colony, and was joint author, with Arthur Bloxham Corner, of <span class="italic">Crown Practice</span> (1844).<br>
