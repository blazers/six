<span class="headword">Bryan, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1500), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in obscure circumstances, though he assumed arms containing three piles in allusion to those of Sir Guy Bryan (<i>d</i>. 1390) whose barony became extinct in 1456. His early career suggests that he was the son of a Londoner, and the most probable lineage is that of John Bryan (<i>d</i>. 1395), citizen and fishmonger, whose son John (<i>d</i>. 1418) owned property in various parts of London, Buckinghamshire, Middlesex, and Essex. Sir Thomas likewise had property in London and Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Thomas Bryan may have attended university before turning to legal study in the 1440s. An incident in the year-books for 1496, when he dismayed Sir Roger Townshend by referring to universal and particular negatives, the figure, and a sophister's verse, certainly suggests a more advanced scholastic background than was usual for a common lawyer. By 1456, when he acted as a feoffee of Gray's Inn, he was doubtless already a bencher, and in the same year he made his first appearance in the year-books. At this period he was acting as counsel to several London companies, and by 1459 he was steward of St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1460 he was elected common serjeant of London, an office which he held until his creation as a serjeant-at-law in 1463. By April 1470 he had become one of the king's serjeants.<br>
<br>On the accession of Edward IV in 1471 Bryan was appointed chief justice of the common pleas, and in 1475 was created a knight of the Bath. In 1472 he received a remarkable patent of reappointment &#145;during good behaviour&#146;, the usual form of judicial appointment being &#145;during the king's pleasure&#146;. The plea roll for Hilary term 1477 contains a badly defaced drawing which shows Bryan, in robes, receiving an amended version of this patent from the king. His tenure of the chief justiceship, which lasted for a little over twenty-nine years until his death, was the longest ever, though his lasting influence was staid rather than innovative. He always maintained that the common law should be guided by equity and justice, and he was not unaware of social changes: for instance, he favoured the new-found protection of the copyholder against his lord by an action of trespass. Nevertheless, in a period when the king's bench, under Hussey and Fyneux, was developing new remedies and becoming a rival court for court of common pleas, Bryan's judicial conservatism set the court of common pleas on a course which by the end of the sixteenth century would seem distinctly reactionary.<br>
<br>Bryan did not favour the current movement to find a means of barring entails. Although the doubts which he expressed in <i>Taltarum's case</i> (1472) failed to prevent the common recovery from becoming established in the early years of his presidency, he was scrupulous to protect the interests of leaseholders and remaindermen. Such considerations seem to have weighed less with his fellow judges, but the legacy of his cautious approach was the elaborate scheme of double and triple vouchers developed in the following century. In <i>Hulcote's case</i> (1493) he stopped counsel from disputing the &#145;common learning&#146; that a landowner's freedom to dispose of the fee simple could not be restrained by condition, while in the same case approving a condition against barring an entail: this distinction encouraged a spate of &#145;perpetuity clauses&#146;, to counter the common recovery, which were not finally declared ineffective until 1613. Bryan was also opposed to the circumvention of wager of law by means of actions on the case, the issue later to provide the main source of contention between the two benches.<br>
<br>Bryan married Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1467), widow of Thomas Blount, treasurer of Calais, whose jointure lands lay in Lincolnshire. The couple settled, however, in Buckinghamshire, at Marsworth near Ashridge, and it was in the latter's church that Bryan desired to be buried if he died within 20 miles. Bryan also owned London houses in the parishes of St Andrew, Holborn, and St Sepulchre; he had some connection with St George's Inn and in 1475 purchased the freehold of Thavies Inn, both in the latter parish. Bryan may have married as his second wife Isabella, widow of William Bowes. He died on 14 August 1500.<br>
<br>Bryan's only son, Sir Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1518), was admitted to Gray's Inn, but became a knight of the body, and vice-chamberlain to Katherine of Aragon. The younger Sir Thomas Bryan had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3788/', "Sir Francis Bryan (d. 1550)")</script>, who was a courtier, diplomat, and man of letters, and had two daughters, Elizabeth Dilcock and Joan Clement.<br>
