<span class="headword">Mason,  Francis</span>  (1565/6&#150;1621), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in co. Durham; his parents are unknown. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 10 May 1583, aged seventeen, and was elected a probationer fellow of Merton College in 1586. Although he graduated BA from Brasenose College, on 27 January 1587, it was Merton that presented him for both his MA (4 July 1590) and BD (7 July 1597) and for his licence to preach (30 June 1597). The only hint of his later controversialist temperament came in 1591 when he was censured for objecting vehemently to the divinity defence of Thomas Aubrey. On that occasion he successfully defended himself against the decision to suspend him from full membership of the university. During the royal visit to Oxford the following year he was one of the defendants before Queen Elizabeth in the after-dinner Latin debate &#145;whether civil disorders are useful to a state&#146; at which the French ambassador was also present  (Merton College, Oxford, Registrum Annalium, 1567&#150;1603, 158). On 23 November 1599 he was presented to the rectory of Sudbourn, with the chapelry of Orford in Suffolk, an appointment that he held for the rest of his life. Within a few years he married Elizabeth Price. They had three children, two of whom, Elizabeth and Samuel, were baptized at Orford respectively on 9 September 1604 and 4 May 1606.<br>
<br>Mason's first work, <span class="italic">The Authority of the Church in Making Canons and Constitutions</span>, appeared in London in 1607. It derived from a sermon that Mason preached in the summer of 1605 at the Green Yard at Norwich and was dedicated to Archbishop Richard Bancroft. Against the puritans Mason reiterated the validity of a church over which James VI and I was supreme governor, and in which only the king could authorize the making of canon law, and urged the superiority of bishops. &#145;The ministers of England are not in popular paritie, but our Bishops are advanced above the rest, being indued with power by giving orders and the exercise of ecclesiasticall jurisdiction&#146;  (p. 16). In support of this opinion Mason adduced the biblical witness of the letters of Timothy and Titus before appealing for a learned ministry to be established in each parish in accord with canon 34. While he admitted that where there was no apostolical injunction for ceremonies such as the use of the surplice, the ring in marriage and the sign of the cross at baptism, and kneeling at communion, he claimed that to &#145;transgress the law of his Prince&#146; was to &#145;leave his pastorall charge, and make a rent in the Church of Christ&#146;  (p. 38). Discipline, especially the ceremonies, &#145;is for the most part variable, according to circumstance of time and place&#146;  (p. 34). Such a moderate defence of the present state of the church was principally intended to remind all parties in the church that division was a much greater scandal than that alleged in the enforcement of ceremonies. Mason hoped that &#145;this olive branch&#146;, &#145;an exhortation to holy obedience&#146;, would serve to correct those carried away &#145;rather from weaknesse then of wilfulnesse&#146;  (sig. A2). A revised edition was entered at the Stationers' Company on 26 August 1632, to be printed in London, but it was stayed at the printers. Not until 1634, when, according to Thomas Crosfield, Dr Brian Duppa, then vice-chancellor of Oxford, ordered it to be reprinted &#145;in opposition to what Dr Prideaux read his lecture upon&#146; at the Act of 12 July  (Oxford, Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 68<i>r</i>), was it published, by John Lichfield at Oxford.<br>
<br>A more vigorous defence of the Church of England, this time against Romish attacks on the validity of Anglican episcopacy in the context of the controversy over Anglican orders begun by George Downham's rigorist consecration sermon of 1608, appeared with Mason's name on the title-page in 1613. <span class="italic">Of the Consecration of the Bishops in the Church of England</span> was dedicated to Archbishop George Abbot and is framed as a discourse between one Philodox, a seminary priest, and Orthodox, a minister of the Church of England. Using archival evidence from Lambeth Palace, the book traced the episcopal succession in England from the reign of Edward VI to refute the claims of Bellarmine, Nicholas Sanders, Richard Bristow, Thomas Harding, William Allen, Thomas Stapleton, Robert Parsons, and other leading Romanists. In particular it sought to end the controversy of the &#145;Nag's Head&#146; story and to show that the consecrations of Matthew Parker and the first Elizabethan bishops had been canonically valid and that the full apostolic succession had been maintained in England since before the Reformation:<blockquote>I have set downe the successive Ordination, and Golden Chaine of the most reverend Father George, now [Lord] Archbishop of Canterbury, extending linke by linke unto the Bishops in the time of King Henry the 8, which our adversaries acknowledge to be canonicall. (p. 142)</blockquote>On 12 May 1614, according to Mason in a note on the flyleaf of the copy of his book surviving at Merton College, Oxford, Archbishop Abbot showed the archival evidence to &#145;some of their discreet catholics&#146;&#151;John Cottington, Thomas Leake, and Thomas Laithwaite SJ&#151;that &#145;they might view and consider whether they be true, or counterfeit&#146;.<br>
<br>Whether or not Mason wrote the defence in its entirety has been disputed, despite his autograph note in the copy that he presented to his Oxford college. George Davenport, a friend of John Cosin in Paris, later claimed that according to Cosin, who had been Bishop John Overall's secretary and chaplain from 1616, it was written by the bishop of Norwich himself. &#145;Mr Mason indeed added something to it, with the approbation of the Bishop, and printed it in his own name at the desire of the Bishop whose Chaplain (I think) he was&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 52, fol. 103). According to Cosin, Mason had lodged with Overall in London at the time and may have held the same posts in the household in which Cosin succeeded him. Both Overall and Mason are credited with writing <span class="italic">The Validity of the Ordination of the Ministers of the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas</span> that finally appeared in 1641 as part of the debate over moderate episcopacy.<br>
<br>The 1613 vindication was roundly answered by Anthony Chamney in <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Vocation of Bishops and other Ecclesiasticall Ministers</span> (1616), published at Douai and dedicated to the archbishop of Canterbury. Later reprinted in Latin at Paris, it was the first of several antagonistic responses to the calm assertiveness of the original work, and Thomas Fitzherbert, Henry Fitzsimon, and Matthew Kellison joined in the attack. Mason's work was reissued in 1618 and at Abbot's prompting he began to translate it into Latin.<br>
<br>On 13 December 1619 Mason was chosen archdeacon of Norfolk by Abbot, who had the right of presentation following Bishop Samuel Harsnett's promotion; he was instituted on 18 December. However, the following year illness curtailed his activities, although he still attended the king as a royal chaplain and preached before him in January 1621. &#145;Upon David's Adultery&#146; and &#145;Upon David's Politick Practice&#146;, published as <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at the Kings Court</span> (1621), censured James for going after foreign women, and in the prelude to the Spanish match are part of the literature drawing admonitory models of James from King David, attacking the rhetoric of &#145;carnall Concupiscence&#146; so often found in the court of princes. Mason died at Orford in December 1621 and was buried in the chapel there on 21 December. The funerary monument put up by his widow depicts him in academic dress kneeling in prayer. His <span class="italic">De ministero Anglicano</span> was completed and published by Nathaniel Brent. An amplified version, <span class="italic">Vindiciae ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1625), was dedicated to Bishop Henry de Gondy of Paris. The Latin editions extend the scope of the original, not only by taking the allegations of Champney and others into account but also defending the ordinal of Edward VI and the impropriety of speaking of sacrifice in the eucharist.<br>
<br>Mason's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_18279"></a><span class="headword">John Mason</span>  (<em>b. </em>1576/7), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 15 October 1591, aged fourteen, and graduated BA from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 23 July 1599. He proceeded MA on 9 July 1603, when he became a fellow. He obtained his BD in June 1610 only after recanting opinions that were regarded as unorthodox. He was granted a licence to preach on 12 May 1612 and may have become in 1620 vicar of Yazor, Herefordshire. Nothing further is known of him.<br>
