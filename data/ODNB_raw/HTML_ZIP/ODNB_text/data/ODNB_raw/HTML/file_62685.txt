<span class="headword">Blease,  (Walter) Lyon</span>  (1884&#150;1963), <span class="occ">barrister and civic activist</span>, was born on 30 May 1884 at 5 Beech Street, Fairfield, Liverpool, the second son and second of three children of Walter Blease (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1940), chartered accountant, and his wife, Mary Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1936), daughter of James Harvey of Manchester and his wife, Anne. Lyon, as he was known, grew up in comfortable circumstances, a devoted son of affectionate parents. His father, whose family were Baptists, worked strenuously to expand an accounting firm established by his father and an uncle. Mrs Blease's family were Presbyterian and committed to temperance, free trade, and other Liberal causes. Both parents were active in charities. Mrs Blease served as a poor-law guardian.<br>
<br>Brought up a Presbyterian, Lyon Blease attended Parkfield School, Liverpool (<i>c</i>.1891&#150;1899), and was then sent to Sedbergh School but soon returned home with a knee injury. He then went to Shrewsbury School (1900&#150;02). An able student, he was made praeposter and head of house, but was ill at ease with his peers. Principled and prudish, he was treated with contempt. Devastated, he feigned illness, neglected his schoolwork, and contemplated suicide. Finally, his father agreed that he should not return to school. By then, however, Blease had acquired an enduring commitment to serious reading and self-study. History and literature were his favoured subjects, but he was also interested in the arts. Intensely high-minded, he was bent both on self-improvement and on preparing himself for public life. At a time when he was shifting to agnosticism, he found a sense of ethical purpose in the prospect of public service.<br>
<br>At his father's urging, Blease read for a law degree and the bar at the University of Liverpool, keeping terms at Lincoln's Inn. He received his LLB and was called to the bar in 1906. Awarded a studentship at the bar final examination (1906), he took an LLM at Liverpool in 1908. He practised as a Chancery lawyer in Liverpool, and in 1910 was appointed lecturer in the law and custom of the constitution at Liverpool University.<br>
<br>More drawn to politics and letters than the law, Blease campaigned on behalf of temperance, free trade, and other Liberal causes before the First World War and in the January 1910 general election unsuccessfully contested Lancashire's Chorley division for the Liberals. A strong suffragist, he was president of the Liverpool committee of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage from 1908. Together with his occasional writings, Blease's <span class="italic">The Emancipation of English Women</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">A Short History of English Liberalism</span> (1913) brought his views before a wider public. An exponent of the new Liberalism, he urged state welfare provision to enable individuals to develop their abilities and contribute to the common good.<br>
<br>During the First World War Blease served with hospital units in Serbia, Russia, and Romania. In Serbia he worked as a gentleman orderly in a medical mission led by the surgeon James Berry, co-authoring an account, <span class="italic">The Story of a Red Cross Unit in Serbia</span> (1916). Here Blease met his future wife, Harriott Davies (1884&#150;1972), a spirited trained nurse. Both later served at the Anglo-Russian hospital in Petrograd. With Russia's military collapse, members of the staff travelled east to Japan.<br>
<br>Blease and Davies were married in Tokyo in 1918 and remained in Japan for a year. He worked as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">New East</span> and with Harriott's help prepared his study <span class="italic">Suvorof</span> (1920), using material gathered in Russia. The couple had three daughters, and Blease proved very solicitous for their education.<br>
<br>From 1919 to 1949 Blease was Queen Victoria professor of law at Liverpool University, serving twice as dean of the law faculty (1919&#150;25 and 1942&#150;5). He combined the appointment with practice at the bar. Consistently with the faculty's emphasis on professional training rather than on research, his legal scholarship was limited to textbooks on conveyancing. Eloquent and charming, he was public orator of the university from 1931 to 1949.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, Blease remained a tireless champion of humane and liberal causes. His concerns ranged from the university's ban on married women staff (which he vigorously opposed) to work for Jewish refugees. In the general elections of 1945 and 1950 he contested Liverpool's East Toxteth and Garston divisions for the Liberals, again unsuccessfully. An accomplished, many-sided man, he used his talents to enrich the life of his community. He lectured on literary and other subjects to diverse groups (including the Workers' Educational Association); participated in radio broadcasts and amateur theatricals; served as chairman of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society, the Merseyside Film Institute Society, and the Liverpool executive council of the National Health Service (1952&#150;60).<br>
<br>Blease's distinction rested not on any one achievement but on many good works. Although the parliamentary career he dreamed of eluded him, his life lent substance to his liberal vision, linking self-development with civic virtue. He died of coronary thrombosis on 12 April 1963 at his home, 12 Eaton Road, Cressington Park, Liverpool, and was cremated in Liverpool.<br>
