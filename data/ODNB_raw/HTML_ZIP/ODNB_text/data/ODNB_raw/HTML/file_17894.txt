<span class="headword">Malone,  Anthony</span>  (1700&#150;1776), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Ireland on 5 December 1700, the eldest son of Richard Malone (1674&#150;1745) of Baronston, co. Westmeath, and his wife, Marcella, the daughter of Redmond Molady, the nephew and coheir of Sir Patrick Molady of Robertstown. His father was the only son of Anthony Malone and his wife, Mary, the daughter of John Reily of Lismore. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17895/', "Edmund Malone (1704&#150;1774)")</script>, barrister and politician, was his brother. While a student at the Temple he had attracted the favourable notice of William III through diplomatic work in the Netherlands. He was called to the Irish bar about 1700 and pursued a successful legal career before his death on 6 January 1745.<br>
<br>Anthony Malone was educated at Mr Young's school in Abbey Street, Dublin, before proceeding to Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 November 1717; he was awarded the degree of LLD by Trinity in 1737. On 30 March 1720 he entered the Middle Temple, London; a week later, on 6 April 1720, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. After spending two years at the university he returned to the Middle Temple. He was called to the Irish bar in May 1726, and in the following year he was elected MP for co. Westmeath, being returned at the same time for Blessington, which seat he declined. In July 1733 he married Rose (<i>d</i>. 1773), the daughter of Sir Ralph Gore, bt, speaker of the Irish House of Commons; the couple had no children. At an early date in his career Malone was earning more than &pound;3000 per annum, and by now he had established himself in Dublin as a successful barrister. In the Commons he became noted as an orator and attracted the attention of the Irish administration. In 1737 he voted with the minority against the devaluation of gold, on the grounds that it would harm Irish trade. He became prime serjeant-at-law in 1743, and served as a justice of assize on several occasions between 1744 and 1750, as well as in 1760 and 1763. In parliament he was associated with Gore's successor as speaker, Henry Boyle, who had the greatest influence in the Irish Commons, but he also earned the praise of George Stone, archbishop of Armagh, who described him as &#145;the most considerable Man here, and the most usefull to the Government; at the same time, He is of all those in the Service of the Government, the most independent and the least importunate for Favours&#146;  (Burns, 87).<br>
<br>Relations between Stone and the Boyle party, and as a result between Boyle and the government, later became strained, partly through Stone's failure in 1751 to support the application for the post of solicitor-general of Malone's younger brother Richard (1706&#150;1759), MP from 1741 for Fore. Stone suspected that Malone's Irish and Catholic ancestry made him naturally inclined against the British interest in Ireland. Malone was seen as the leader of anti-government opinion in the early 1750s, and he incurred the displeasure of the duke of Dorset's administration in 1753 for his insistence that the bill allowing the appropriation of surplus revenues should refer to royal recommendation of the measure rather than emphasizing royal consent. He was removed from office by order of the ministry in London. However, he was compensated by Dorset's successor, William Cavendish, marquess of Hartington, in 1756 with a patent of precedence at the bar&#151;one of a series of measures designed to conciliate the Boyle party and leading to accusations that they had surrendered their patriot principles by some colleagues and the mob. He was also offered the post of chancellor of the exchequer, which he at first refused because he feared a loss of income from the bar and was loath to alienate his allies. He was eventually appointed on 10 September 1757, with an additional pension to compensate for the reduction of his law practice, and he was sworn of the privy council on 26 October.<br>
<br>Malone remained an influential member of the Commons, ensuring parliamentary majorities for the administration of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford. His career was tarnished, though, in 1758, when he became a partner in an unsuccessful bank with Nathaniel Clements, vice-treasurer of Ireland, and Sir Arthur Gore. The collapse of Malone, Clements, and Gore (founded on 3 July 1758, but closed on 1 November 1758) led to the act prohibiting persons holding public funds from engaging in banking, and was considered by Pitt to have contributed to the discontent with Dublin politics manifested in the anti-union riot in December 1759.<br>
<br>Malone was dismissed from the exchequer in 1761, when he resisted the transmission of a money bill to England as a cause for calling a new parliament. Pitt thought the punishment improper, but learned of it too late for his opinion to be counted. Malone and the ministry may have connived at his dismissal, in order for him to retire with honour and return to the bar. In the election of that year Malone was elected for Castlemartyr on the interest of his old ally Boyle, by then earl of Shannon. The Malones were of Catholic descent, and Malone's mother had been born a Roman Catholic, a heritage reflected in his sympathy for Catholic grievances. He supported Monck Mason's bill for enabling Catholics to invest money in mortgages upon land, and in 1762 he was appointed, with Sir Richard Aston, to try the whiteboys of Munster. The two concurred in ascribing their outrages to local and individual grievances. Malone's political enemies, including William Gerard Hamilton, suspected in 1763 and afterwards that Malone was preparing a return to opposition politics, but their fears were never realized.<br>
<br>At the election of 1768 Malone was returned for both Granard and co. Westmeath; he chose to sit for the county. In his later years he occasionally advised the government. His wife, Rose, died on 22 April 1773, and he himself died on 8 May 1776 at his home in Sackville Street, Dublin. His nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17896/', "Edmond Malone")</script> remembered him as a man of large and even robust stature, in later years his abundant grey hair giving him a commanding and venerable appearance. By his will, made in July 1774, Malone left all his estates in the counties of Westmeath, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, and Dublin to his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17897/', "Richard Malone")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17895/', "Malone, Edmund (1704&#150;1774)")</script>], afterwards Lord Sunderlin, the eldest son and heir of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17895/', "Edmund Malone")</script>, &#145;in the utmost confidence that they will be settled and continue in the male line of the family and branches of it, according to priority of birth and seniority of age&#146;. But Lord Sunderlin, who had no children, did not obey this injunction, and on his death in 1816 the right of succession was disputed.<br>
