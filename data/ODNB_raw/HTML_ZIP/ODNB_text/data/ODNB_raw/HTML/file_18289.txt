<span class="headword">Mason,  Robert</span>  (1579&#150;1635), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the son of Stephen Mason of Kingsclere, Hampshire. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 February 1592, was called to the bar in 1617 and made a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1633. Mason married twice: his first wife was Edith, daughter of John Foyle of Dorset, and his second Hester, daughter of Edward Richards of Yaverland on the Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>Mason was the author of <span class="italic">Reasons Monarchie</span> (1602), a work on the nature of reason, dedicated to Sir John Popham, chief justice of king's bench, which ends with some verses entitled &#145;The Minds Priviledge&#146;. In 1605 he published <span class="italic">Reasons Academie</span>, at the end of which are some verses entitled &#145;Reasons Moan&#146;, attributed to Sir John Davies. The book was reprinted in 1609 under the title <span class="italic">A Mirrour for Merchants with an Exact Table to Discover the Excessive Taking of Usurie</span>. In 1616 Mason was secondary of the Poultry Compter prison in London, but for most of his career his main offices lay in his home county, where he served as steward and recorder of Basingstoke from 1624, recorder of Winchester from 1628, and recorder of Southampton from 1633. He acted as legal counsel to Winchester Cathedral and to the earl of Southampton (to the latter he also lent money). In 1627 he received a commission of oyer and terminer for Southampton, renewed in 1635.<br>
<br>Mason's parliamentary career began in 1626 with his return for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, contested and upheld in a by-election. He supported the Commons in their proceedings against George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, together with Sir Benjamin Rudyerd assisting Mr Herbert in the delivery of the impeachment charges to the Lords on 3 May, and later motioning for the commitment of the duke. On 17 May, following the imprisonment of Sir John Eliot and Sir Dudley Digges for their speeches at a joint conference, Mason spoke eloquently of the privileges of parliament men, noting that &#145;We sit not here as private men but as public vessel[s] for the commonwealth's service&#146;  (Bidwell and Jansson, 3.271). In 1628 he was returned for Winchester. His parliamentary maturity is apparent by 1628. He spoke frequently and assisted at several conferences related to the drafting of the petition of right. Arguing passionately against the use of martial law in peacetime, against unparliamentary taxation, and for cause to be shown on warrants he said &#145;We sit here not only to take men out of jail but to keep them free&#146;  (Johnson and others, 3.188). His speeches are masterpieces of legalese honed and shaped for fellow lawyers. While serving in the Commons he was counsel for Sir Simeon Steward and in 1629 defended Sir John Eliot in his case against the crown. Throughout the early 1630s there is little evidence of the pattern of his career. He was greatly respected by Attorney-General Noy and in 1634, in the heat of the ship-money controversy, the king appointed him recorder of London. In that capacity he was ordered by the council to appear before them regularly with an account of London moneys raised for ships. His term as recorder was short but the judge Sir Richard Hutton wrote that Mason was a good recorder, and a man of great intelligence whose death would be lamented  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 106). Mason died in London on 20 December 1635 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral on 6 January 1636. His contribution to the <span class="italic">Perfect Conveyancer, or, Several Select and Choice Presidents Collected by Four Sages of the Law, Ed. Hendon, Robert Mason, Will. Noy, and Henry Fleetwood</span>, was published posthumously in London in 1650.<br>
<br>Mason is not to be confused with two namesakes. Confusingly, Robert Mason (<i>b</i>. 1570/71) of Shropshire also entered Lincoln's Inn in the 1590s; following his matriculation at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1591, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 8 October 1597. <a name="cosubject_18289"></a><span class="headword">Robert Mason</span>  (1589/90&#150;1662), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the son of George Mason of Greenwich, Kent, formerly of Keighley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Barbara, daughter of John Parkins of Flintshire. He was admitted a scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1606, graduating BA in 1610 and proceeding MA in 1613; his MA degree was incorporated at Oxford in 1617. He was a fellow of his college from 1610 to 1632 and senior proctor of Cambridge University in 1619&#150;20. In the early 1620s he became associated with the duke of Buckingham, possibly through his cousin, John Mason, and was appointed one of the duke's secretaries, spending time in France from May 1624. In 1626 Mason was actively involved in Buckingham's election as chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In 1626 he contested the parliamentary seat of Ludgershall, Wiltshire, but a close contest and a double return were followed by Mason withdrawing his candidacy when the election was re-run. He served as Buckingham's secretary on the expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; the following year. His fidelity to the duke was rewarded by a legacy of &pound;500 in Buckingham's will and his creation as LLD by royal mandate in 1628. In 1629 he was granted full admission to Doctors' Commons. He subsequently held positions in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts. He served as chancellor of the diocese of Winchester from 1628 until the civil war and as commissary of the archdeaconries of Surrey and Winchester. At the Restoration he was restored to Winchester and also became chancellor of the diocese of Rochester. He served on the admiralty courts in London and Hampshire and was a commissioner for piracy in both places. He was appointed a master of requests in 1640, in which year he moved from Doctors' Commons to Whitehall. On 11 July 1633 he married Judith, daughter of Sir Christopher Buckle of Great Burgh, Banstead, Surrey; the couple had six sons and five daughters. He died of apoplexy at Bath in 1662 and was buried in Bath Abbey on 27 June of that year; his monument (now lost) gave his age at death as seventy-three. Mason, who was survived by his wife, left his library to St John's College, Cambridge.<br>
