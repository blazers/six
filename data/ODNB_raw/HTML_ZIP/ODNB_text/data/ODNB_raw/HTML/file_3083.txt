<span class="headword">Bownas,  Samuel</span>  (1677&#150;1753), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born on 20 January 1677 at Shap, Westmorland, the second of the two children of Anthony Bownas (<i>d</i>. 1677), shoemaker, and his wife, Agnes. Samuel's father died within a month of his birth. Thereafter money was short and he and his brother received only a basic education in reading and writing. At thirteen Bownas was apprenticed to his uncle, a blacksmith, who mistreated him, and later to Samuel Parat, a Quaker of Sedbergh, Yorkshire. Samuel's mother made sure that he was educated as a Quaker, but although he followed the traditional forms of dress, speech, and worship they meant little to him. He went regularly to meeting but confessed that &#145;the greater part of my time, I slept&#146;  (Bownas, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 5). However, aged about twenty, he was shaken from his lethargy by a visiting travelling minister, Anne Wilson, who rebuked him as &#145;a traditional <i>Quaker</i>&#146;  (ibid.), that is, one who came and went from meeting untouched and unchanged.<br>
<br>Bownas was &#145;convinced&#146; and shortly after felt called to the ministry. For the three remaining years of his apprenticeship he stayed in the Sedbergh area. On completing his seven years Bownas began to travel widely, drawing on the experience and encouragement of many fellow ministers, including James Dickinson and James Wilson. They let him know if he was becoming too pleased with his ministry and urged him to be faithful. On his travels he was careful to remain financially independent and supported himself by harvest-work and other enterprises. About 1701, on a visit to Sherborne in Dorset, Bownas met Joan Slade, his future wife. However, the couple agreed to postpone their marriage as Samuel felt called to travel in the ministry to America, and he set sail for Maryland, by way of Scotland, in 1702.<br>
<br>While in America, Bownas was particularly engaged with challenging the preaching of the renegade Quaker George Keith, who had taken Anglican orders. Keith had Bownas prosecuted for preaching and thrown into gaol on Long Island, where he was held for nearly a year. Samuel learned to make shoes in order to earn a living and received visits from, among others, an &#145;Indian king&#146; together with &#145;three of his chief Men&#146;  (Bownas, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 79). After his release in 1703 Samuel travelled in New England in the ministry before returning home at the end of 1706. Early in the following year he and Joan were married and settled in Lymington, Hampshire. In 1708 he visited Ireland, and in 1712 he was imprisoned for tithes in Bristol gaol by the vicar of Lymington. Bownas was soon released after the clergyman tricked Joan into paying the money in question, a mistake which troubled her greatly on her deathbed in October 1719.<br>
<br>On 11 April 1722 Samuel married Elizabeth Nicholls, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Priest (<i>d</i>. 1746), a widow from Bridport in Dorset, to where he now moved. Samuel used his wife's capital to set up in business and became a prosperous merchant. He also read widely and educated himself, establishing a reputation as a well-known travelling minister. Described as &#145;of a grave deportment, and of a tall comely and manly aspect&#146; Bownas had a strong, clear voice and preached with &#145;divine authority and majestic innocence&#146;  (Bownas, <span class="italic">Account</span>, vi).<br>
<br>In 1726 he returned to America, where he met Elizabeth Hanson, from whom he heard the story of her capture, with her children, by Native Americans in 1724. Hanson's narrative was subsequently published as <span class="italic">An Account of the Captivity of E. H. Taken in Substance from her Own Mouth by Samuel Bownas</span>. Samuel offered his own <span class="italic">Description of the Qualifications Necessary to a Gospel Minister</span> in 1750; the book, which was well received, reached its fifth edition by 1839.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Bownas grew increasingly disillusioned with the Society of Friends. In a letter to an old companion and fellow minister James Wilson he spoke of a church &#145;very barren of young ministers to what it was in our youth&#146;, and with &#145;but very little convincement to what was then&#146;. To Bownas, the quality of &#145;convincement&#146; was the main purpose of his ministry, though its importance was often ignored by his audience: &#145;&#147;The man spoke well&#148; say they, and that is all I get for my labours&#146;, he wrote to Wilson  (&#145;Samuel Bownas to James Wilson&#146;). In spite of his disillusionment Samuel continued to travel extensively for as long as he was physically able. From 1749 he became increasingly infirm, &#145;his hands shook and his eye-sight failed him much&#146;  (Bownas, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 197), but he continued to attend meetings locally until his death at Bridport on 2 April 1753 aged seventy-six.<br>
<br>Samuel Bownas was characterized by his contemporaries as &#145;a Man of Peace and Prudence&#146;  (Bownas, <span class="italic">Account</span>, vii) who tried to uphold and pass on the traditions of Quakerism while never giving undue importance to forms for their own sake. His life showed the importance for even those born and brought up as Quakers to come to a living faith for themselves. The autobiographical <span class="italic">Account of the Life, Travels, and Christian experiences &hellip; of Samuel Bownas</span>&#151;&#145;a plain Man's plain and good account of his own Progress in Religion&#146;  (ibid., iii)&#151;was published in 1756 with a prefatory note by Joseph Besse.<br>
