<span class="headword">Erskine,  John Francis Ashley</span>, Lord Erskine  (1895&#150;1953), <span class="occ">politician and administrator in India</span>, was born on 12 April 1895, the elder son of Walter John Francis Erskine, twelfth earl of Mar and fourteenth earl of Kellie (1865&#150;1955), and Lady (Susan) Violet Ashley-Cooper (1868&#150;1938). He bore the courtesy title of Lord Erskine, but, predeceasing his father, he never succeeded to the peerage. Erskine was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford. He served through the First World War, initially in the Scots Guards and later, in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, attaining the rank of major. The war over, on 2 December 1919 he married Lady Marjorie Hervey (<i>b</i>. 1898), elder daughter of the fourth marquess of Bristol. They had four sons. In November 1922 he was elected as the Unionist MP for Weston-super-Mare, which he represented for the next eleven years, except for a few months in 1924 when the Labour Party was in office. In 1932 he became an assistant whip in the National Government.<br>
<br>Erskine had a keen interest in the affairs of the empire, following particularly closely the round-table conferences of 1930&#150;33 which eventually led to the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935. Before it was passed, however, he accepted the governorship of Madras, arriving in India in 1934. Madras represented one of the few unequivocal successes of the previous scheme of constitutional reform drawn up by Edwin Montagu and Lord Chelmsford in 1918 and enacted in 1920. A local &#145;Justice Party&#146; had emerged to work the reforms with the British government and to keep the nationalist Congress Party at bay. Erskine confidently expected the same to happen after the first elections under the new act, which took place in 1937. But he was to be sorely disappointed. The Congress Party swept to power with its largest majority anywhere in India.<br>
<br>At first, this promised Erskine serious difficulty. The Madras Congress was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, one of Mahatma Gandhi's principal lieutenants. However, Erskine's political skills proved refined, and the 1937&#150;9 Congress ministry co-operated with the British authorities to a degree not initially anticipated. Madras enjoyed two years of relatively stable government. None the less, d&eacute;nouement came with the approach of war: in 1939 Erskine was obliged to suspend the legislature under section 93 of the 1935 act and impose direct rule by the British executive, as Congress withdrew from office in protest at India's involvement in the war.<br>
<br>Erskine returned to England in 1940 and, soon after, was elected MP for Brighton at a by-election. He was eager to serve in the wartime government but was to be disappointed. He represented a side of the Conservative Party which had long been at odds with the now ascendant Winston Churchill, who had opposed the 1935 <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span>. In March 1941 Erskine resigned his seat and retired to his house, Ickworth, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where he was active in local affairs, especially during the Second World War. But his health steadily deteriorated and, after a major operation, he died at Ickworth on 3 May 1953, at the age of fifty-eight. His wife survived him. Erskine always regarded himself as a Conservative in the liberal tradition, perhaps closest among his generation to R. A. B. Butler, who had drafted the 1935 act. This meant that his political fortunes went into eclipse under Churchill's leadership, and he died before they had a chance to recover in later years.<br>
