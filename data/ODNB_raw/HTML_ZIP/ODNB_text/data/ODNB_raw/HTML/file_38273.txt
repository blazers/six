<span class="headword">Lynch,  Eliza Alicia</span>  (1835&#150;1886), <span class="occ">mistress of Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez, marshal-president of Paraguay</span>, was born in co. Cork, Ireland, on 3 June 1835, the youngest daughter of John Lynch (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1808), a medical doctor and country squire, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd. Relatively little about Lynch's childhood has surfaced, though she clearly enjoyed an affluent status. According to her later testimony, her father, a Roman Catholic, was related to two bishops &#145;and more than seventy magistrates&#146;  (Lynch, 6). He had graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, and while he never practised as a physician, he married into a family of well-placed protestant landowners. His wife's family were of Welsh descent, and owned considerable property not only in Ireland, but also in England and on the French coast opposite Dover; they included naval officers who had served under Nelson.<h2>
<a name="AnIrishgirlinFrance"></a>An Irish girl in France</h2>In later years Lynch described her time in Ireland in nostalgic and idyllic terms. The reality was almost certainly different. She was ten years old when the famine devastated the island. Her ambition for wealth and security, which later observers thought so exaggerated, doubtless had its origin in what she saw happen to her poorer neighbours. That she dreamed of becoming a princess represented more than just a childish fantasy; it brought a measure of escape from the uncertainties she witnessed in Ireland. These took a personal turn when her father suddenly died when she was still &#145;very young&#146; (probably in the mid-1840s). Her mother then removed the adolescent girl from Ireland, taking the family to live at Boulogne; Lynch received most of her education in France.<br>
<br>Aged fourteen, Lynch made the acquaintance of a French army pharmacist, Xavier Quatrefages (<i>b</i>. 1813), who arranged with Lynch's mother to marry the young girl. The marriage took place at the parish church, Folkestone, Kent, on 3 June 1850, her fifteenth birthday. Her new husband was twenty-two years her senior, and could boast a solid, petit-bourgeois background (his father, Pierre Quatrefages, was a merchant) and some years of service in the army. An image of her at this time reveals a young girl of surpassing beauty, with alabaster skin, blue-grey eyes, slim waist, and a sparkle of maturity far beyond her years. She displayed, moreover, considerable charm and effervescence. The qualities that led Lynch so easily into marriage quickly led her out of it. The piquant tales that her political enemies circulated many years afterwards had her involved in a series of passionate affairs with her husband's commanding officer, a Russian archduke, an English banker, and a Spanish aristocrat whom she met after the newly wed couple arrived at Quatrefages's posting in Algiers. The details of each of these supposed affairs remain obscure. What is known is that Lynch fell ill in the desert environment, and took the first opportunity to move to Paris where she cut herself free from her husband. Though she always stayed on good terms with Quatrefages, she never lived with him again. Instead she dedicated herself to finding a more suitable partner.<br>
<br>Eliza Lynch had a natural command of the art of flattery so highly prized in the Parisian <i>demi-monde</i>. The modest allowance she received from her family kept her alive. Meanwhile, her flair for languages, her broad reading, her choice of fine furnishings and the best of wines, and her skill at telling gentlemen callers what they wanted to hear made her an outstanding presence in the lesser salons of the Second Empire. She knew many suitors, but was constantly on the lookout for a permanent protector, which she found in the person of Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez (1826&#150;1870), whom she claimed to have met at a ball in Paris early in 1854  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 May 1871, 14). Son of the Paraguayan president, L&oacute;pez had come to Europe to seek diplomatic support for his little-known country and to obtain armaments for its fledgling armed forces. Queen Victoria and the British foreign secretary treated L&oacute;pez with all the seriousness due to the offspring of a foreign head of state. In France he was presented to Napoleon III and Empress Eug&eacute;nie. With his sensual features and over-elaborate uniforms, L&oacute;pez appeared to some casual observers as more savage than statesman, and he felt out of his depth in the glitter of Old World receptions. Yet he spent lavishly, a habit that always attracted a following, including Madame Lynch, as she now styled herself.<h2>
<a name="FirstladyofParaguay"></a>First lady of Paraguay</h2>In short order, Lynch joined L&oacute;pez as his travelling companion to Italy and Spain, though Pope Pius IX refused to receive L&oacute;pez so long as he flaunted his affection for a common courtesan. By now Lynch had become not only the Paraguayan's lover but also his most trusted confidante, his chief adviser, and the only person not afraid to directly challenge his opinion. In November 1854 they travelled separately back to South America: he went aboard the Paraguayan warship <i>Tacuar&iacute;</i> and she aboard a passenger ship, reaching Buenos Aires in January 1855, when she gave birth to their son Panchito.<br>
<br>Lynch's arrival at the port of Asunci&oacute;n in Paraguay, after a 1000-mile journey upriver, occasioned curiosity in the town. Many poor Paraguayans felt dazzled by her glamour and show of Parisian fineries, as witnessed by a British resident, George Frederick Masterman. President Carlos Antonio L&oacute;pez was less impressed by Francisco's choice of a partner, not least because her marriage to Quatrefages had never been annulled. The president forbade his son from living outright with Lynch, and within the family it was understood that she might act as unofficial consort, but never as wife. Even so, all nine of the children she bore Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez received their father's surname and his claim to respect and authority in Paraguay.<br>
<br>The irregularity of Madame Lynch's connection with L&oacute;pez made her few friends among the society ladies of Asunci&oacute;n. Her paramour indulged her with money, properties, and luxuries of all kinds. Soon she was the richest woman in Paraguay, but she still craved respectability. Feeling profoundly isolated, Lynch made some friends among the foreign community, busied herself with her children, and promoted education in the country. She encouraged the government to employ instructors and cultural advisers from abroad. She sponsored literary contests and advised journalists. She created a salon of sorts in Asunci&oacute;n that included many members of the foreign community. Eliza Lynch influenced Paraguayan culture in basic ways. She introduced jewelled coiffures and straw hats decorated with flowers, and imported perfumes, tulles, and belts, thus breaking accepted conventions in fashion. She did the same for music and dance. She imported one of the first pianos in the country and one of its first sewing machines. She popularized the polka and the London <i>karap&eacute;</i>. The open way in which she broke with the established high culture influenced a younger generation. Members of the Paraguayan &eacute;lite began to see themselves almost as Europeans in consequence, and, like the <i>madama</i>, they became ambitious. In the case of Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez himself, it meant transforming Paraguay into a major force in South American politics. When his father died in 1862 the general succeeded to the presidency and set out to fulfil what he saw as his country's destiny.<br>
<br>During his father's lifetime Solano L&oacute;pez had been given carte blanche to launch a programme for the rapid modernization of Paraguay, especially the country's military. He had contracted the Blyth brothers of Limehouse, London, to make available European engineers and machinists to build an iron foundry, merchant fleet, and railroad. Armaments were imported and a huge fortress in the south at Humait&aacute; (which foreigners frequently compared to Sevastopol) was constructed. By the time of his succession to the presidency L&oacute;pez could point to a formidable army, one of the largest in South America.<h2>
<a name="Paraguayatwar"></a>Paraguay at war</h2>In 1864 L&oacute;pez retaliated against Brazilian incursions in the Banda Oriental of Uruguay by seizing the southernmost districts of Brazil's Mato Grosso province. He had thought to make common cause with his supporters in Montevideo, and the following year he rashly sent an expeditionary force across Argentine territory to aid those potential allies. This senseless provocation caused an unlikely triple alliance of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay to spring into existence against him. The bloody war that followed lasted five more years.<br>
<br>Opponents of Eliza Lynch have claimed that she encouraged L&oacute;pez to assume the rank of marshal and launch the war in expectation that Paraguay would emerge as an acknowledged great power. He would then become emperor and their children would be recognized as princes. There is less to this tale than meets the eye. What is true is that she stayed close to L&oacute;pez throughout the conflict, from the long siege of Humait&aacute; (1866&#150;8) to the terrible retreat to the north (1868&#150;70). He took other mistresses during these years, and she made him suffer publicly for it. Still, their basic partnership and mutual affection never seriously wavered.<br>
<br>The war proved the most brutal conflict ever seen in South America, and brought enormous suffering to the uncomplaining Paraguayans. Food was scarce and became more so. Casualties were extremely high, especially after cholera and smallpox spread from among the ranks into the civilian population. Over half of all Paraguayans perished, leaving 28,000 adult males out of a total prewar population of 450,000. As these terrible events unfolded, L&oacute;pez lost his grip on reality. He imagined treachery on all sides, and ordered the execution of some of his most trusted advisers. Only Madame Lynch seemed capable of calming his rage. She herself saw much of the war, tending to the sick, and giving encouragement to the troops, among whom she was always popular. Detractors argued that she ran an espionage organization that carried out some of the worst atrocities. No evidence supports this calumny, though it is clear enough that Lynch remained a strong partisan of the national cause long after it was obviously doomed. She several times offered to command female troops, and though this offer was rejected she evidently wore a uniform of sorts, complete with riding crop as symbol of authority.<br>
<br>Asunci&oacute;n fell on 1 January 1869 at about the same time that the starving remnants of the Humait&aacute; garrison struck their flag. Lynch and L&oacute;pez fled inland as the allies installed a puppet government. Though he now commanded only a tiny force of children and old men, the marshal fought on. Eventually the allies grew tired of his raiding and mounted a new campaign to root out and destroy his followers. Lynch and L&oacute;pez, accompanied by a few faithful officers, drew back into the forests of northern Paraguay. During these last months on the run Marshal L&oacute;pez slaughtered many of his remaining cohorts, including his own brother. He had his own mother flogged. On 1 March 1870 the Brazilians caught up with L&oacute;pez near the Aquidab&aacute;n river at Cerro Cor&atilde;. Called on to surrender, the defiant marshal was fatally lanced by a cavalryman. Lynch was on a nearby trail moving up by carriage together with Panchito, now at fifteen a colonel in the army. As the Brazilians approached, Panchito, like his father before him, refused to surrender. He, too, was lanced to death. His mother, covered in his blood, was permitted to scoop out a grave for both her first-born son and his father.<h2>
<a name="Exileandfinalyears"></a>Exile and final years</h2>Lynch received deferential treatment from her Brazilian captors, but not from the Paraguayans. The surviving society women of Asunci&oacute;n petitioned the new government to demand that she relinquish the jewels that L&oacute;pez had stolen. Allied troops guarded her house after she disembarked at the capital, but there was never any doubt that they intended to expel her. She vehemently denied possession of any stolen property, and demanded the right to face her accusers. When she sought formal British diplomatic protection, on the ground that she was a British-born subject, the Foreign Office in London denied her claim, since her marriage to a French subject deprived her of British nationality. However, the British envoy at Buenos Aires was advised to request that the local authorities offer her protection. At Buenos Aires, she transferred aboard a British vessel, the <i>City of Limerick</i>, and sailed to Europe together with her remaining children and those that L&oacute;pez had fathered with other mistresses. Arriving at Southampton in July 1870, she divided her time between homes in Paris and London. Still a relatively young woman, Eliza Lynch spent her remaining years trying to clear her name and that of the dead marshal. She had managed to get some money out of Paraguay during the early stages of the war, though not nearly as much as some later claimed. She now loudly insisted that her children deserved their full inheritance, no matter what slanders the allied propaganda machinery invented about the family. L&oacute;pez, she truthfully insisted, had formally assigned her all his worldly goods, and now she and her children intended to get what was theirs. She was involved in lawsuits brought in Edinburgh (May 1871) and London (May 1872), calling many of her former acquaintances from Paraguay to testify as to her good character.<br>
<br>Lynch returned to South America in 1875 to pursue a legal settlement over the vast properties that the marshal had transferred to her name a decade earlier. She issued <span class="italic">Exposici&oacute;n y protesta</span> in Buenos Aires to explain her position to a less than sympathetic public. Tired and depressed, she returned empty-handed to Europe and left her remaining Paraguayan affairs to her sons, Enrique Venancio, Carlos Honorio, and Federico Morgan Lloyd. She may have gone back to Ireland for a short visit, and then went for a time to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage. In the end, though, she always returned to Paris, where, alone and ignored, she died of stomach cancer on 25 July 1886. She was buried in the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery.<br>
<br>The story of Madame Lynch's love affair with Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez has long remained the stuff of gossip in Paraguay, and has inspired novelistic treatments by foreigners. In 1961 the government of Alfredo Stroessner brought her remains back to Asunci&oacute;n, but controversy clouded the occasion. Because her martyred lover had been placed in a national pantheon that was simultaneously consecrated as a church, the bishop refused to allow the marshal's paramour to rest by his side. Lynch was instead interred in an ornate marble tomb in another cemetery several miles away. In her native Ireland, on the other hand, no monument has ever been erected to her memory, and she has been almost completely forgotten.<br>
