<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tennent family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1740&#150;1890), <span class="occ">brewers</span>, were descended from tenant farmers who farmed on land to the north of Glasgow. By the seventeenth century many were engaged as market gardeners, maltmen, and brewers.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_97864"></a><span class="headword">Robert Tennent</span>  (1679&#150;1757)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest of seven sons of Patrick Tennent (1650&#150;1715), a maltman and gardener, and his wife, Janet, the daughter of Ninian Anderson, provost of Glasgow. Robert Tennent is described in various records as a market gardener and vintner. In 1738 Glasgow's town council employed him to clear land and plant new trees on the old Glasgow Green at the Broomielaw, and to supply 300 ash trees for the New Green nearby. In 1756 he was engaged to lay out a tree-lined walk on the New Green.<br>
<br>By the 1740s Robert Tennent had became the tenant of the White Hart Inn on one of Glasgow's main thoroughfares, the Gallowgate, where he also brewed beer and distilled spirits from malt produced in his own maltings. He did so without becoming a member of the Incorporation of Maltmen, which fined him for malting without paying his dues to the incorporation. In 1749 he went to the court of session to challenge the incorporation's right to control malting activity in the city. He lost the case, but his challenge encouraged other Scottish brewers who wished to free themselves from restrictions imposed by the guilds.<br>
<br>In 1750 Robert Tennent purchased 13 acres on the Gallowmuir outside Glasgow and built houses alongside his market garden there, in a development that became known as Tennent's Toun. He sold the land and houses four years later and invested the proceeds in the construction of a new inn on the Gallowgate called the Saracen's Head. It became the most famous hotel and fashionable meeting place in Glasgow, with a ballroom that held 100 people and thirty-six bedrooms that, according to an advertisement placed in the local newspapers, contained beds that were &#145;all very good, clean and free from bugs&#146;. However, the expense of the venture bankrupted him and, according to a newspaper report, he died in Glasgow in 1757 &#145;broken-hearted through disappointment&#146;. His widow, Catherine Liddell (sometimes recorded as Siddell), had to rent the hotel from his creditors in order to continue the business.<br>
<br>Robert's brother Hugh Tennent (1693&#150;1776) was a deacon of gardeners in Glasgow and a market gardener and quarryman, as well as the owner of a number of buildings and brewhouses in the city. Two of his sons, John Tennent (1732&#150;1827) and Robert Tennent (1749&#150;1826) began renting a brewery in the Drygate in the 1770s, trading as J. and R. Tennent. They extended the premises, acquiring land that included an adjacent brewery and distillery at Wellpark belonging to the brothers James and John Maclehose. By the beginning of the nineteenth century J. and R. Tennent's enlarged brewery was known as Wellpark.<br>
<br>J. and R. Tennent became well known for their Scotch ale and also for porter, which they began to brew at Wellpark in the 1780s. The firm established thriving markets for their products in England (supplied primarily by sea through Liverpool and Bristol) and in Ireland. It began exporting beers to the Americas in the 1790s.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_97865"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Tennent</span>  (1780&#150;1864)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of Robert Tennent (1749&#150;1826), of the J. and R. Tennent partnership, and his wife, Christian Neilson, was born at Wellpark, Glasgow, on 16 February 1780, and matriculated at Glasgow University in 1794. He became a partner in Middleton and Tennent, West Indies merchants, and in 1804 married Christian Rainy (<i>d</i>. 1863), the sister of Harry Rainy, professor of medical jurisprudence at the University of Glasgow. They had five sons and two daughters. Hugh Tennent inherited the business of J. and R. Tennent after the deaths of his father and uncle in the 1820s. Under his direction, and in close association with William Middleton &amp; Co., the firm increased the volume of sales abroad and exported to the West Indies, the southern USA, South America and the East Indies. In 1855, with the firm valued at &pound;220,000, he retired from business to his villa at Fairlie in Ayrshire. In 1862 he moved again, after purchasing the Errol estate in the Carse of Gowrie, Perthshire.<br>
<br>Hugh Tennent was a committed Christian who donated generously to church-building projects in the city and provided a site for the construction of Wellpark Church near the brewery. After the Disruption in 1843 he joined the Free Church of Scotland and was a generous benefactor: in 1855 he paid for the construction of Wellpark Free Church in Glasgow and he contributed to scholarships intended to assist young men studying to enter the ministry. He also provided substantial funds for the construction and maintenance of both day and night schools in the east end of the city. He was the first chairman of the parochial board of Barony parish and a director of Glasgow Royal Infirmary and of the Glasgow Athenaeum.<br>
<br>A Liberal in politics, Hugh Tennent served as a town councillor in Glasgow (1833&#150;8) and as a JP. He was a keen yachtsman, crossing the Atlantic and sailing in the Baltic and Mediterranean. He contributed large sums of money to the Italian nationalist Garibaldi and visited him in Caprera. He died on 15 July 1864 aboard his yacht, the <i>Ursula</i>, while sailing in Bantry Bay in Ireland.<br>
<br>Hugh Tennent's fifth son, Charles Stewart Parker Tennent (1817&#150;1864), had trained as a brewer and worked for his father at Wellpark. In 1854 he married Arabella Jane (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of Archibald Argyll Hay. He purchased the firm in a series of instalments after his father's retirement. Charles's ownership of the brewery was contested by his brother Gilbert Rainy Tennent (1814&#150;1889), who had previously forfeited his inheritance in return for assistance in settling his debts, only to renege on his agreement. The dispute was not finally settled until 1870, when the trustees of Charles Tennent (who had died on 19 February 1864, predeceasing his father) were victorious in a case taken to the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Charles Tennent's sons, Archibald Tennent (1861&#150;1946) and <a name="cosubject_48891"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Tennent Tennent</span>  (1863&#150;1890)<span class="occ"></span>, known as Hugh T. Tennent, who was born at Mount Vernon, Old Monkland, Lanarkshire, on 21 October 1863, were infants when their father died and so the business was managed on their behalf for twenty years by the trustees. Tennents continued to prosper under the trustees and the firm's famous red T trademark, registered in 1876, became one of the most famous in the British brewing industry. By 1886 the brewery covered 11 acres and produced 3 million gallons of ale and 1.5 million gallons of stout per annum. Two-thirds of the output was sent for export and it was claimed that Tennents was the largest exporter of bottled beer in the world.<br>
<br>In 1869 Charles Tennent's widowed mother, Arabella Tennent, married Richard Frederick Fothringham Campbell (1831&#150;1888) of Craigie, who was Liberal (later Liberal Unionist) MP for Ayr from 1880 until his death. Hugh T. Tennent, his brother Archibald, and sister Annie were raised at Craigie House in Ayrshire, where Arabella had five children with her second husband. The brothers suffered from poor health but Hugh was able to start work at the brewery in the late 1870s and was trained in management. He became sole owner of J. and R. Tennent on his twenty-first birthday in 1884, having purchased his brother Archibald's share in the firm.<br>
<br>During the early 1880s Hugh T. Tennent travelled to Europe with the family physician and friend, J. F. Wyllie Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1905), and was impressed by the qualities of German lager beer. Lager was being imported in increasing quantities to the United Kingdom and was popular in many of Tennents' export markets. Hugh decided to begin brewing lager in Glasgow and employed a German and a Danish brewer to set up operations there. The firm began brewing lager in the late 1880s and in 1889 Tennent engaged the German firm L. A. Riedinger to build a specialist lager brewery at Wellpark. The new brewery was completed in 1891, after Hugh's death. Tennents lager was the first to be brewed and marketed successfully by a British company and it became one of the country's most famous beer brands.<br>
<br>Hugh T. Tennent died, aged only twenty-six, of &#145;acute fever&#146; and &#145;fatty heart&#146;  (d. cert.), at 40 Westbourne Gardens, Kelvinside, Lanarkshire, on 3 February 1890. Unmarried, he was a wealthy man, and his estate, which included the extensive Dunalistair estate in Perthshire, was divided among his relatives and friends. The management of J. and R. Tennent passed again to trustees and in 1901 to a limited company, J. and R. Tennent Ltd, which was controlled by members of the Campbell family.<br>
