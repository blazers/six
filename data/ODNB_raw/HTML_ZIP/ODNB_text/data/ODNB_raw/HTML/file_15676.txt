<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kirkpatrick,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1812), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and diplomatist</span>, was the illegitimate son of James Kirkpatrick (1730&#150;1818), a colonel in the East India Company's army, and Mrs Booth, wife of a London solicitor. Born in Ireland, Kirkpatrick was raised at boarding-school, supported but unacknowledged by his father. In 1771 his father, &#145;the Handsome Colonel&#146;, purchased Kirkpatrick an East India Company military cadetship and the young man sailed for Bengal. He had a half-sister from the Booths's marriage whom he probably never met, and two younger half-brothers, his father's legitimate children, George and James Achilles, whom he met in India after their father placed them in the company's service and told them of their half-sibling. Ambitious for promotion, Kirkpatrick learned Indian languages and gained access to Indian information networks. Known as Kirk to his friends, he was regarded as a generous if sometimes profligate companion. He suffered from rheumatism, gambled, drank, and told John Kennaway of a melancholia, the &#145;kind of shadow or image of a calm sorrow or grief&#146;, he often experienced  (Kirkpatrick to Kennaway, 13 June 1779, Devon RO, Kennaway MS 961 M add F2 1/3).<br>
<br>In 1779 Kirkpatrick became interpreter for Lieutenant-Colonel Stibbert, commander-in-chief of the Bengal army, and in 1781 was made a captain. He purchased and had compilations made of Indian texts, establishing a useful network of Indian contacts. Poona's representative at Hyderabad said Kirkpatrick was &#145;expert in everything&#146;, having &#145;wonderful intelligence and mastery of Persian speech, is equally careful in writing, understands accounts, and is well informed in public business and is versed in astronomy&#146;  (G. R. Kale to Nana Fadnis, 20 Feb 1794, in Sarkar, 1.ix).<br>
<br>In 1782 rheumatism and the Indian climate caused Kirkpatrick to resign from the East India Company service. With the two children he had with his Indian mistress, he sailed for England, and <i>en route</i> for Europe wrote his <span class="italic">Grammar of the Hindoo Dialect and an Arabic and Persian Vocabulary</span>, which was published in the same year under the company's patronage. In London he published translations of Persian works and promoted the Bengal Orphan Fund (later the Bengal Military Fund), a trust providing charity for soldiers' orphans which he had founded before his reluctant departure from India. Failing to support himself, he resumed his commission in 1784 and, leaving his children under his father's care, returned to India. In Calcutta, on 26 September 1785, he married Maria Rawson. Although the couple had four daughters, it was an unhappy union. On 21 November 1786 he began his brief tenure as resident to Mahadji Sindhia. Kirkpatrick wrote to Governor-General Cornwallis of how Sindhia and his court were insulting and inattentive. The maharaja in turn complained of the resident's haughty attitude. In October 1787 Kirkpatrick was replaced and he returned to regimental duties.<br>
<br>Kirkpatrick's career languished until 1790, when he joined Cornwallis's staff as interpreter during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. In 1792 he headed a diplomatic mission to Nepal, leading the first Britons into that kingdom. Kirkpatrick told Cornwallis's secretary, Colonel Ross, on 27 October 1792, that the mission went to settle a dispute between Nepal and Tibet and &#145;to advance useful knowledge&#146;  (BL OIOC, Kirkpatrick MSS, MS Eur. F/228/1, fol. 41). Arriving after the dispute ended, he spent three weeks in Nepal, and though he returned to India without concrete benefit, the mission was regarded as a successful foray into an unknown land.<br>
<br>In January 1794 Kirkpatrick replaced Sir John Kennaway as resident to the nizam of Hyderabad. He followed Governor-General Sir John Shore's non-interventionist policy: despite the nizam's pleas and his own sentiments, he refused to involve the company in the Maratha&#150;Hyderabad war of 1795; and in 1796, during the Poona succession crisis, he did not attempt to restrain the nizam from interceding in Maratha affairs. Meanwhile, he continued to pursue local knowledge. A network of Indian informants supplied him with news and gossip both from Hyderabad and from across the subcontinent, and his hired scribes copied books from Mughal archives. This enabled him to produce road-maps and to assist James Rennell with an atlas of northern India.<br>
<br>Kirkpatrick's rheumatism persisted, forcing his resignation from the residency and a second departure from India, in 1797. At Cape Town he met Richard Wellesley, earl of Mornington, who was <i>en route</i> for Bengal to take office as governor-general. Wellesley interviewed those at the Cape with Indian experience. At Wellesley's request Kirkpatrick wrote essays on Indian affairs. After their meetings Kirkpatrick believed Wellesley intended to follow Shore's non-interventionist policy toward the Indian princes, while Wellesley held that Kirkpatrick had supplied information necessary to pursue the forward policy instructed by London. Wellesley accordingly offered Kirkpatrick a job in Calcutta and, despite his health, he accepted. Working closely with Wellesley as secretary to the secret and political department, he acted as adviser to his half-brother James Achilles Kirkpatrick, the Hyderabad resident, when the nizam signed the treaty of Hyderabad, by which Hyderabad became a British protectorate. In the spring of 1799, during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, William Kirkpatrick accompanied Wellesley to Madras. After the death of Tipu Sultan and Seringapatam's fall in May 1799, Kirkpatrick sat on the Mysore settlement commission. In 1801 he was unable to take up his appointment as Poona resident owing to rheumatism, which was causing him to keep bandages wrapped tightly around his knees and forehead.<br>
<br>Kirkpatrick left India in 1802, and settled in Exeter, where he lived at Southernhay House. He continued to pursue his Indian interests, and helped select the East India Company's library, a collection now part of the British Library. In 1804 he published translations of documents said to have been discovered at Seringapatam, and in 1811 an account of Nepal. He also studied the Indian calendar, endeavouring to detail Tipu Sultan's horoscope and understand that ruler's fate. By 1809 rheumatism confined Kirkpatrick to his chair. In the summer of 1812 he auctioned his possessions and on 22 August 1812 he overdosed on laudanum near London, an apparent suicide.<br>
