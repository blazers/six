<span class="headword">Hardie,  Matthew</span>  (1754&#150;1826), <span class="occ">violin maker</span>, was born in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, on 23 November 1754, a son of the clockmaker Stephen Hardie. He was apprenticed to a joiner, and on 19 May 1778 became a member of the south fencibles, a volunteer regiment set up by Henry Scott, third duke of Buccleuch. He obtained a discharge in 1782 by presenting another man as substitute. On 12 February 1779 he married Juliet, daughter of Alexander Baillie, from Ross-shire, in the College Kirk, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Although the Hill family of violin dealers thought that Hardie may have studied with the London violin maker John Betts, no proof is available. A more likely influence is thought to be his Edinburgh contemporary John Blair (<i>fl</i>. 1790&#150;1822), whose work is charming and beautifully varnished. Between 1784 and 1788 Hardie occasionally repaired stringed instruments for the Edinburgh Musical Society. In 1790 he was trading as a maker in Edinburgh's Old Town, in the Lawnmarket; in 1794, as a &#145;Fiddle Maker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Williamson's Edinburgh Directory</span>, 1794&#150;6, 23) in Carrubber's Close; in 1795&#150;6, at Baxter's Close; and in 1799, &#145;opposite the Fountain Well north side&#146;  (Hill archive, fol. 131). He and Juliet had at least two children, William (<i>b</i>. 1796) and Charles (1801&#150;1802). By 1801 Hardie was in financial difficulties, perhaps because the Edinburgh Musical Society had disbanded in 1798, although in 1797 a cello had been commissioned for Nathaniel Gow, a &#145;very good Stradivari copy&#146;  (private information (C. Beare)). The quality of his work earned him the title &#145;the Scottish Stradivari&#146;.<br>
<br>The duchess of Buccleuch sponsored benefit concerts for Hardie. One advertisement read:<blockquote>Since the conclusion of the American War, when the South Fencibles were discharged in which corp Matthew Hardie had the honour of serving, he has applied himself to making violins, etc, but on account of his numerous family, has never been able to acquire a sufficient stock to carry on trade to advantage. (Glen, 1.xxii)</blockquote>The concerts may have brought him an order from an army captain for a violin, completed in 1801, which featured in an exhibition of British makers in London in 1998; the catalogue states that his best work is &#145;very fine, and although firmly based on classical principles and often modelled on the long pattern of Stradivari, is full of idiosyncratic touches&#146;.<br>
<br>Juliet died on 17 September 1801, and on 29 May 1802, at Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh, Hardie married Hannah McLaren, with whom he had three children, Thomas (1803&#150;1858), who succeeded him in the business, Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1804), and Henrietta (<i>b</i>. 1806). His second wife must have died by 26 May 1806, when he married Jean McBain at Canongate Kirk. They had a more settled life &#145;by the Fountain Well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory</span>, 1810&#150;11, 110) until 1811. In 1812 he moved to Baillie Fyfe's Close, and in 1814 to Low Calton. He married for the fourth time in Edinburgh on 27 July 1817; his new wife was Marion Gilles. He was living at 10 Paul's Work in 1822; and at 15 Shakespear Square in 1824, by which time he was trading as Matthew Hardie &amp; Son with Thomas, who had probably started working with his father when he was about ten years old. Hardie had another able assistant, David Stirrat, and also may have employed Alexander Youle and George Ferguson, among others.<br>
<br>Hardie and his son were both reputed to be alcoholics, but if so, Hardie's condition was not so severe as to inhibit his friendships with Edinburgh's best musicians, and some of his humorous and witty stories have been recorded by various authors. In 1826 he was imprisoned for debt and sent to St Cuthbert's poorhouse, where he died on 30 August 1826. He was buried in Greyfriars' kirkyard, Edinburgh, in an unmarked grave. Many of his instruments, mostly violins and cellos, remain in use in the twenty-first century; illustrations of them may be found in various books about British violin makers.<br>
