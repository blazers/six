<span class="headword">Davie,  Cedric Fredric  Thorpe</span>  (1913&#150;1983), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 30 May 1913 at 4 Eliot Vale, Lewisham, London, the elder of the two sons of Thorpe Davie (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1954), singing teacher and a Glaswegian, and his wife, Gladys Louise Butcher (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1954). From his earliest years Thorpe Davie, as he too was known, showed his father's artistic commitment and determination; he won a Caird scholarship to the Scottish National Academy of Music, Glasgow, where he gained the first-year piano prize. His development and promise were recognized through a second Caird award in 1932, which enabled him to study initially with Harold Craxton at the Royal Academy of Music, London. Thorpe Davie, however, nurtured creative ambitions and moved to the Royal College of Music in 1933 to study theory, orchestration, and composition with R. O. Morris, Gordon Jacob, and Ralph Vaughan Williams while continuing piano tuition with Egon Petri. He then used his scholarship for further studies with Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly in Budapest and Yry&ouml; Kilpinen in Helsinki, with a visit to Sibelius when in Finland.<br>
<br>Some of Thorpe Davie's early pieces were performed by his father's choir. A student piano trio constituted his official opus 1, but in 1935 the <span class="italic">Phantasie quartet</span> for strings (winner of the Cobbett prize) and the choral and orchestral <span class="italic">Dirge for Cuthullin</span> (awarded the Sullivan prize) first established his reputation as a composer. The latter work was dedicated to Margaret Russell Brown (<i>d</i>. 1974), whom he married on 23 March 1937.<br>
<br>In 1936 Thorpe Davie was appointed to teach music theory at the Scottish National Academy of Music. While there he affirmed his love of Scotland, a lifelong passion traced through diverse work from the <span class="italic">Fantasy No. 1 on Scottish Tunes</span> (1937) to the treatise <span class="italic">Scotland's Music</span> (1980). Thorpe Davie became a leader in Glasgow's musical life, supporting contemporary work and encouraging adventurous programming. The war years saw him in the city's fire service and establishing contact with the Orcadian author Robert Kemp, then seeking a score for a BBC radio programme, <span class="italic">Scotland at War</span>. Their collaboration in 1943 encouraged Thorpe Davie to write further for radio broadcasts and for films, a field in which he was frequently to provide&#151;with characteristic integrity&#151;music of a Scottish flavour.<br>
<br>Thorpe Davie's links with the composer and musicologist Howard Ferguson, dating from their student days, can be attributed to shared Celtic roots as well as shared academic and practical musical interests. Thorpe Davie's concerto for piano and string orchestra (1944) predates that of Ferguson by seven years and must have exerted an influence in its form and spirit. Through Ferguson, he met Gerald Finzi: their friendship led to regular correspondence and musical liaison, leading St Andrews University eventually to acquire Finzi's manuscript eighteenth-century editions (for which Thorpe Davie compiled a scholarly catalogue).<br>
<br>In 1945 Thorpe Davie's career began to blossom. His symphony, placed second in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> victory music competition, was premi&egrave;red at the Royal Albert Hall, and he was appointed master of music at St Andrews University. Here he became a pivotal figure, founding the department of music in 1947 and becoming reader in 1956 and professor in 1973. In common with Finzi, Thorpe Davie showed active interest in eighteenth-century music. Arrangements of songs for productions of the ballad operas <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span> and <span class="italic">The Highland Fair</span> (staged at the Edinburgh Festival in 1949 and 1952 respectively) established his partnership with the director, Tyrone Guthrie. In 1948 their renowned production of Sir David Lindsay's play <span class="italic">Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis</span> made Thorpe Davie's name as a theatre composer. Commissions followed for Shakespeare productions&#151;<span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (1949), <span class="italic">King Lear</span> (1950), and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1951). In addition, Thorpe Davie was a prolific composer in the film world, completing twenty-four scores, including four for Walt Disney. Further recognition followed with <span class="italic">Flowers from the Rock</span>, written for the twenty-first birthday of Princess Margaret, and a coronation march, &#145;The royal mile&#146;, as a result of which he was appointed OBE in 1954.<br>
<br>Enthused by his Scottish heritage, Thorpe Davie composed <span class="italic">Variations on a Theme of Sir Alexander Mackenzie</span> (1949) and a choral work, <span class="italic">Ode for St Andrew's Night</span> (1950). He also wrote music for Robert Burns's dramatic cantata <span class="italic">The Jolly Beggars</span> (1954). Thorpe Davie considered another of his choral works&#151;a setting of verse by the Scots poet Alastair Reid (<span class="italic">Directions for a Map</span>, 1955&#150;6)&#151;to be perhaps his best work. In 1964 he composed a second <span class="italic">Fantasia on Scotish Tunes</span> (the title using the traditional spelling) to commemorate the opening of the Forth road bridge, and he was joint compiler of <span class="italic">The Oxford Scottish Song Book</span>. His last major work, a suite based on eighteenth-century Scots fiddle tunes, celebrated the bicentenary of Edinburgh's New Town (1967). By then&#151;in common with the previous experience of Ferguson&#151;Thorpe Davie felt his essentially tonal expressive idiom had grown outmoded, and so determined to concentrate his energies on his academic work.<br>
<br>From his university base Thorpe Davie exerted wide influence, demonstrating the dedication to amateur and youth music-making that had been revealed in his earlier writing for the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and the National Youth Brass Band of Scotland. He chaired the music panel of the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board (1966&#150;71) and the music committee of the Scottish Arts Council, also acting as a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain (1968&#150;73). Awards in tribute to his work included honorary fellowships from the Royal Academy of Music (1949) and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (1978) and an LLD degree from Dundee University (1969).<br>
<br>Predeceased by his wife in 1974, Thorpe Davie lived from 1978 in retirement at Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, pursuing his enthusiasm for hillwalking. A lover of cats, crosswords, malt whisky, and Scottish country dancing, and possessed of a great (if slightly eccentric) sense of humour, he died, following a heart attack, on 18 January 1983 at Dalry. He was cremated at Ayr.<br>
