<span class="headword">Schapiro,  Boris</span>  (1909&#150;2002), <span class="occ">bridge player and gambler</span>, was born in Riga, Latvia, on 22 August 1909 (9 August old style), into a wealthy Jewish family of horse dealers, the son of a Russian-speaking father, Herman Schapiro, and a German-speaking mother. After the German invasion of Latvia in 1914 the family moved to St Petersburg, where Schapiro attended Madame Bombeck's kindergarten. The family fled Russia during the revolution, escaping by cattle truck to Odessa, where they met Captain Sherwood, the British master of the <i>Dago</i>, who had shipped Schapiro horses to Hull. With his help they arrived at Toulon on armistice day 1918, then proceeded via Paris to Doncaster, where a branch of the family business had been established in the 1850s, providing horses for the London Bus Company, pit ponies, and hunters. Continuing this business, Herman Schapiro also diversified into meat and textiles.<br>
<br>Schapiro was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, before being dispatched to Bradford Technical College, to emerge as a fellow of the Textile Institute. He briefly attended the Sorbonne, but concentrated less on philosophy than chasing girls. Joining the family business, he bought meat for its butcher shops at Smithfield at 3 a.m., often playing bridge at the Hamilton Club until then. He worked for his father in Hamburg until 1935, when, interpreting for Viscount Castlerosse (in Berlin to interview Hitler for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>), he provoked some Brownshirts and spent two nights in a Gestapo gaol. On 10 August 1935 he married Genia Gitta Slutzkin (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Julius Slutzkin, a Russian leather merchant. Fluent in Russian, German, French, and English, he served in the Army Intelligence Corps during the Second World War. In the early 1950s he left the family business for the baccarat syndicate at Crockford's, the premier London gaming club, utilizing his experience as a racecourse bookmaker. Later he supplemented his income through journalism. His first marriage was dissolved in 1967, and on 25 March 1970 he married Helen May Johnson (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), secretary, and daughter of Arthur Johnson, sales manager. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Schapiro played tennis at Wimbledon in 1936, losing in the first round. He had also been an international showjumping and dressage competitor. Increasingly, however, his life became dominated by bridge. He had played for money since boyhood, and won a world tournament in 1932 with Oswald Jacoby, his partner from the world auction bridge pairs in 1929. He began playing seriously after the Second World War, his partners including Sophocles Venizelos (later prime minister of Greece), Omar Sharif, and Iain Macleod (later chancellor of the exchequer). Quick tempered, sharp tongued, and critical of his partners, he regularly indulged in gamesmanship, including singing at the table, intimidation, and insult. He often played with his poodle, Vodka, on his lap. His pugnacity was emphasized by prominent pale eyes, an undershot jaw, and &#145;a gruff accent which retained traces of his native Latvian&#146;, but equally displayed &#145;a mastery of the earthier elements of the vernacular&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Dec 2002). Excitable, irascible, grumpy, he did not mellow with age. Nevertheless, his wicked sense of humour, an unexpected Slavonic warmth and charm, and self-confidence commanded respect, affection, and loyalty. Never one to withhold a witticism for reasons of taste, his standard greeting to a good-looking lady was, &#145;Fancy a spot of adultery?&#146; He infuriated Rixi Markus by saying, &#145;The Almighty delighted man by inventing bridge and adultery. When he created Rixi, he combined them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Dec 2002).<br>
<br>Schapiro preferred natural approaches, but played the complex &#145;little major&#146; with Terence Reese. Theirs was a formidable partnership, his flair complemented by Reese's superb technical analysis. (Schapiro later claimed to have won &pound;50 by betting that Reese, whose concentration was legendary, would not notice a naked woman opposite as he played the hand.) After winning the Portland pairs in 1946 they dominated British and international bridge from 1948 to 1965, winning the Bermuda bowl in 1955; the European teams in 1948, 1949, 1954 and 1963; the mixed teams olympiad in 1962, with Fritzi Gordon and Rixi Markus; the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> invitational in 1964; and taking silvers in the world teams olympiad in 1960 and world pairs in 1962.<br>
<br>A crisis occurred at the 1965 Bermuda bowl in Buenos Aires. B. Jay Becker and Dorothy Hayden, members of the North American team, and Alan Truscott, bridge editor of the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, noticed that Schapiro and Reese held their cards inconsistently, and deduced a correlation of finger patterns with their holdings in hearts. John Gerber, the American captain, informed Ralph Swimer, captain of the British team, and Geoffrey Butler, chairman of the British Bridge League (BBL) and member of the World Bridge Federation (WBF) executive committee, who independently verified this. At a special meeting of the appeals committee the WBF found Reese and Schapiro guilty. The British conceded winning matches to Argentina and North America, and withdrew the pair from play. The WBF left the disciplinary decision to the BBL, who set up an independent inquiry by Sir John Foster QC and General Lord Bourne, assisted technically by Alan Hiron and Tony Priday. After ten months, they concluded that although the direct evidence was &#145;very strong&#146; the testimony did not meet the highest standards of proof. The WBF rejected this verdict and in 1967 reaffirmed its decision. As Reese and Schapiro were still barred from playing, the BBF elected not to participate in the 1968 olympiad. In 1968 the WBF restored Reese and Schapiro to &#145;good standing&#146;, deeming that three years' punishment was sufficient.<br>
<br>The incident did not go away, however: an article by Rixi Markus in the American <span class="italic">Bridge World</span> brought a libel suit from Swimer; and Reese and Swimer's refusal to play against each other compromised the 1968 trials. Swimer reported that Schapiro had privately confessed, blaming Reese (&#145;that evil man made me do it&#146;); this Schapiro denied. Reese's <span class="italic">Story of an Accusation</span> (1966) had analysed the hands in detail, arguing that had there been cheating the evidence would show; Alan Truscott's response, <span class="italic">The Great Bridge Scandal</span> (1969), accused Reese of being selective and avoiding the direct issues. Some, including Omar Sharif, insisted that it was an American conspiracy, but the Americans remained equally insistent that the British verdict was a whitewash. Inconclusively exonerated, Schapiro remained bitter, weeping melodramatically whenever the accusation was mentioned. He did not play with Reese again, and avoided competitive bridge until 1975, instead playing high-stakes rubber.<br>
<br>In 1966 the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> appointed Schapiro bridge correspondent; his final column appeared the day he died. He wrote two books: <span class="italic">Boris Schapiro on Bridge / Bridge Analysis</span> (1976); and, with Terence Reese, <span class="italic">Bridge Card by Card</span> (1971). His world titles spanned sixty-six years, from 1932 to 1998, when at the age of eighty-nine he won the world senior pairs (with Irving Gordon, in Lille), and his eleventh gold cup. A world grandmaster, he was made an honorary life member of the English Bridge Union for services to bridge in 1998, recognition previously denied because of the scandal. Schapiro remained alert into his nineties, attributing this to bridge and horses. His ninetieth birthday was a sumptuous affair, the guests including Omar Sharif, Jaime Ortiz-Patino, and Prince Khalid Abdullah, and the occasion toasted with bottles of wine he had collected all his life. He died on 1 December 2002 at his home, Stable Cottage, Thame Road, Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, of fibrotic lung disease. He was survived by his second wife, Helen. In 2004 she sponsored in his memory the Schapiro spring foursomes. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist described him as one of bridge's most colourful and irrepressible characters, one of the finest, most intimidating, and &#145;incontestably&#146; the most durable, concluding that &#145;In a game that attracts more than its fair share of dragons, Boris Schapiro breathed more fire than most&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Dec 2002).<br>
