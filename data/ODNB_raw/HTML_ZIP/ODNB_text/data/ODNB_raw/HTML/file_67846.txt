<span class="headword">Spang,  William</span>  (1607&#150;1664), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born in Glasgow, the son of Andrew Spang (<i>d</i>. 1638), merchant burgess of the city, and his wife (<i>d</i>. in or after 1638). He graduated MA from the University of Glasgow in 1625 and studied divinity in Edinburgh. Spang then taught at Edinburgh high school until 27 January 1630, when the convention of royal burghs appointed him minister of the Scottish church in the staple town of Veere, in the south-west corner of the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Spang is best-known as a correspondent of his cousin, the well-known Glasgow University principal <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1067/', "Robert Baillie (1602&#150;1662)")</script>, and their exchange contributes much to what is known of the latter. Baillie wrote regularly, keeping his cousin informed of affairs in his homeland, while in return Spang wrote about European news and sent over books. Both men were committed presbyterians and Baillie was keen for Spang to obtain the assistance of the Dutch in the name of the cause. In 1641 Veere was the first foreign congregation to be recognized by the general assembly as a component part of the Church of Scotland and the following year Spang was persuaded to attend the assembly. During the 1640s fasts and days of prayer were held in support of Scottish success and on 29 May 1644 the solemn league and covenant was subscribed by members of the congregation in the church.<br>
<br>In turn Spang did much to promote Scottish presbyterianism in the Netherlands. He was involved in the publication of Scottish works, including Baillie's <span class="italic">Operis historici et chronologici libri duo</span> (1668) and an edition of Arthur Johnstoun's poems. He himself publicized the history of the Scottish church with <span class="italic">Brevis et fidelis narratio in regno et ecclesia Scotica</span> (1640, reprinted as <span class="italic">Rerum nuper in regno Scotiae gestarum historia</span> in 1641), and published <span class="italic">Motuum Britannicorum verax Cushi ex ipsis Joabi et oculati testis prototypis totus translatus</span> in 1647. Spang's relationship with Dutch theologians was of most interest to his cousin. He distributed copies of Baillie's works, constantly reminded his peers of Scottish affairs, and undertook propaganda work which persuaded the local <i>classis</i> to commission a book in aid of presbyterianism against English Independency during the deliberations of the Westminster assembly in 1644.<br>
<br>Spang's attachment to the covenanting movement probably contributed to the major dispute of his Veere incumbency. In July 1643 Elizabeth Cant, mother-in-law of the Scots conservator Sir Patrick Drummond, died, and her relatives announced the intention (in accordance with Dutch practice) of placing a memorial stone with her coat of arms in the church. The memorial was erected, notwithstanding the dissent of the kirk session, led by Spang, which argued that the house of God should not have its walls covered with such badges of pride. In an escalation of the dispute, Cant's two sons then accused the minister of persecuting their mother to death. The issue was referred to the general assembly, which in October backed the view of the kirk session. The memorial was removed and in 1644 the pro-covenanting merchant Thomas Cuningham replaced Drummond as conservator. Spang's first wife, whose name is unknown, died in 1647. He then married Anna Meese; they were to have two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1649 Spang was involved in the ultimately successful negotiations to persuade Charles II to sign up to the covenants and return to Scotland. After serving the Veere congregation for twenty-three years, Spang was appointed minister at Middelburg, on 10 November 1652 (though he did not move to his new charge until May 1653). Here he seems to have upset some of the English members of his church by referring to it as a British or Scottish church. He also had to contend with English Quakers who interrupted his sermons in 1655 and 1657, the latter resulting in a Quaker's being sentenced to two years' hard labour by the magistrates. Spang was appointed <i>classis</i> scribe in 1657, and remained at Middelburg until his death there on 17 June 1664. His son William (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1683) followed in his father's footsteps, as minister of Middelburg between 1682 and 1683.<br>
