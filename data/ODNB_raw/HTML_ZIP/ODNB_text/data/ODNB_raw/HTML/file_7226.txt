<span class="headword">Davies,  Catherine</span>  (<em>b. </em>1773, <em>d.</em> in or after 1841), <span class="occ">governess and author</span>, was born at Beaumaris, Anglesey, one of a family of thirty-three children of a twice-married father. At fifteen she went to Liverpool to work in a merchant's family and subsequently to London to live with her sister, who she said was &#145;married to an eminent artist&#146;. In 1802 she was engaged as a governess to a family who were moving to France, but they shortly returned to England because of the tension between the French and the English at that time. However she was engaged by Madame Murat, Napoleon's third sister, who was looking expressly for Englishwomen to take care of her three, and later four, children. Davies was apparently treated with kindness and considerable familiarity in the true sense of the word, maintaining firmly her Welsh origins. Napoleon's visits to his sister were generally secret, but on one occasion at Fontainebleau, when the children greeted their uncle, Miss Davies had a conversation with him and he asked her if she preferred the English to the French and congratulated her on the honesty of her somewhat evasive reply.<br>
<br>In 1808 Murat was made king of Naples by Napoleon and the family took up residence there, visiting the Princess Borghese in Turin on the way after coming through the Mont Cenis Pass. It was then that Davies started to write the book which is her claim to fame, entitled <span class="italic">Eleven Years' Residence in the Family of Murat, King of Naples</span> (1841). The details which she gives of life in this court from the vantage point of the nursery contain anecdotal, but probably reliable, information. Her health was not good and she sought cures for an affliction of the neck at Ischia and Portici, eventually returning to Wales in 1818 to settle in Beaumaris. She was to be called as a witness at the trial of Queen Caroline, but never took the stand.<br>
<br>In 1841 Davies's book was published by How and Parsons at 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. &#145;for her sole benefit&#146;, the preface being dated May of that year. Reviews appeared in both the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span>. A friendly letter from her charge, Prince Achille, by then postmaster in Lipona, Florida, formed one of the appendices to the book. The date of her death is not known but is thought to have been shortly after the publication of the book in 1841.<br>
