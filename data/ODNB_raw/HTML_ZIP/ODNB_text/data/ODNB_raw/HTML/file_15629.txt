<span class="headword">Kingston,  William Henry Giles</span>  (1814&#150;1880), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, born in Harley Street, London, on 28 February 1814, was eldest son of Lucy Henry Kingston and Frances Sophia Rooke. His maternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24060/', "Sir Giles Rooke")</script>, justice of the common pleas. He was educated at Eagle House, Hammersmith, Middlesex, and by private tutors. As a child he frequently travelled to the family residence in Portugal, thereby developing a lifelong affection for the sea. Unable to follow a career in the navy, he entered his father's wine business in Porto in 1833, and soon began writing newspaper articles on Portugal, which were translated into Portuguese. He was instrumental in the successful conclusion of the 1842 trade treaty with Portugal, for which he was awarded the honour of knight of the military order of Christ and a pension from the queen of Portugal.<br>
<br>Kingston's first book, <span class="italic">The Circassian Chief</span>, was published in 1843, and while still living in Porto he wrote <span class="italic">The Prime Minister</span> (1845), a historical novel, and <span class="italic">Lusitanian Sketches</span> (1845), descriptions of travels in Portugal. After settling in England, he interested himself in the emigration movement. He became organizing secretary of the Colonisation Society, lectured on colonization in 1849, and visited the western highlands on behalf of the emigration commissioners. He edited two journals: <span class="italic">The Colonist</span> (1844), and the <span class="italic">Colonial Magazine and East India Review</span> (1849&#150;52), as well as writing a number of pamphlets on emigration and emigrants' welfare. These included <span class="italic">Some Suggestions for a System of General Emigration</span> (1848); <span class="italic">The Emigrant Voyagers' Manual</span> (1850), and <span class="italic">How to Emigrate, or, The British Colonists: a Tale</span> (1850). A man of strong evangelical convictions, he became a founding member and organizing secretary of the Society for Promoting Missions to Seamen. He afterwards took an active part in the volunteer movement, recalling some of his experiences in <span class="italic">Our Soldiers</span> (1863).<br>
<br>From 1850 Kingston's chief occupation was writing books for boys, and editing boys' annuals and weekly periodicals. His best-known stories, are: <span class="italic">Peter the Whaler</span> (1851); <span class="italic">The Three Midshipmen</span> (1873); and its sequels <span class="italic">The Three Lieutenants</span> (1875), <span class="italic">The Three Commanders</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">The Three Admirals</span> (1878). In all, he wrote over 130 stories for boys, many of which had a nautical theme, as for example, <span class="italic">Blue Jackets</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The Cruise of the Frolic</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">Our Sailors</span> (1863), which were based on his own cruising and yachting experiences.<br>
<br>Kingston travelled widely and described his experiences in <span class="italic">My Travels in Many Lands</span> (1862), <span class="italic">The Western World</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">A Yacht Voyage Round England</span> (1879). Following his marriage in 1853 to Agnes Kinloch (<i>d</i>. 1913), his honeymoon was spent in Canada. <span class="italic">Western Wanderings, or, A Pleasure Tour in Canada</span> (1856) recounts his journey. He wrote popular records of travel and adventure in America, Africa, India, and Australia; a biography of Captain Cook; and a history of the navy. He also wrote many historical tales dealing with almost all periods and countries, from <span class="italic">Eldol the Druid</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Jovinian: a Tale of Early Papal Rome</span> (1877) onwards, and undertook some popular historical compilations like <span class="italic">Half-Hours with the Kings and Queens of England</span> (1876). At the time his stories were very popular; his tales were quite innocuous, but most of them proved ephemeral. In addition to writing books, Kingston founded two boys' periodicals: <span class="italic">Kingston's Magazine for Boys</span> (1859&#150;62) and <span class="italic">Union Jack</span>, which he started only a few months before his death in 1880. The former was a didactic journal full of instructional articles, most of which were written by Kingston himself. It also contained a number of translations, and although these bore Kingston's name, they were actually the work of his wife, Agnes, a competent linguist. She translated <span class="italic">The Swiss Family Robinson</span> from the German and a number of separately published stories by Jules Verne, all of which cite her husband as the translator.<br>
<br>Despite his prolific literary output of some five or six books a year, Kingston suffered serious financial difficulties with a family of eight children to support. In 1868 he applied for, and was awarded, grants of &pound;50 and &pound;100, from the Royal Literary Fund. His poor health and reduced circumstances caused him to become a recluse in later life. Realizing he had not long to live, he wrote a touching valedictory letter to <span class="italic">Union Jack</span> readers on 2 August 1880. He died three days later at his home, Stormont Lodge, 3 Brondesbury Park Villas, Willesden Lane, London.<br>
