<span class="headword">Taylor,  Rowland</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1555), <span class="occ">clergyman and protestant martyr</span>, was born at Rothbury, Northumberland. Nothing is known of his parents or early years. He studied civil law at Cambridge, possibly at Pembroke College, where he proceeded to the degree of BCL in 1530 and DCL in 1534. He was principal of Borden Hostel, a hostel for law students, from 1531 until 1538, and also gave poorly attended lectures on Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. He was ordained exorcist and acolyte in 1528, but went no further until 1539, serving instead as an official of the archdeacon of Ely. In 1554 he said that he and his wife, Margaret (whose surname is unknown), had married in John Tyndale's London residence. W. H. Frere wrote that this had occurred twenty-nine years earlier, but this is inconceivable, since in 1525 Taylor would have been a nineteen-year-old undergraduate. The marriage probably took place after 1534, which would explain Taylor's move to Borden Hostel instead of into a fellowship. The Taylors had nine children. Susan, George, Ellen, Robert, and Zachary predeceased him, and there were at least three others, Thomas, Mary, and Anne. The ninth may have been the orphan Elizabeth, whom Foxe reports they adopted.<br>
<br>In a letter to John Foxe, William Turner claimed to have been instrumental in Taylor's conversion to &#145;the evangelical doctrine&#146; at Cambridge  (Craig, &#145;Marginalia&#146;, 411). Hugh Latimer's sermons, which Turner persuaded Taylor to attend, were particularly influential, and Taylor soon attached himself to Latimer. During Latimer's brief term as bishop of Worcester, Taylor was his commissary-general and one of his chaplains. All of Latimer's chaplains preached in the diocese as part of his aggressive campaign to blanket it with reformist preaching. During a preaching tour in 1538 Taylor preached in Kidderminster, where a disgruntled tailor called his effort &#145;a folysshe sermonde of the new lernynge&#146; and wished that the horse from which he preached &#145;had wynsyd and broken his necke&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/134, fols. 298<i>r</i>&#150;300<i>r</i>). In March 1539 Latimer collated him to the parish of Hanbury, which he retained until his death, although he never served it personally. In the same year he was ordained deacon and admitted to St Swithin's in Worcester, with a dispensation for pluralism, which he held until 1544. After Latimer's resignation in July 1539 Taylor moved into Cranmer's service as a chaplain, and was ultimately ordained priest. In 1543 he investigated the prebendaries' plot, and in April 1544 Cranmer presented him to Hadleigh in Suffolk.<br>
<br>Foxe depicts Taylor as the ideal pastor in Hadleigh. Until recently historians accepted that account. However, it is now clear that Hadleigh was served by curates, and Taylor was not active in borough affairs. His denunciation of &#145;nobl ritch gentlemens&#146; as &#145;prowd, enviowis, slothfull, covetowis, glotenewis, letcherus, carnall and worldly, bestly, epycuyrs, oppressors, diffeyners, receyvers, tyrandes, hypochrytes, idolatars&#146;  (Craig, &#145;Marginalia&#146;, 415) may indicate his feelings about some of Hadleigh's merchants, and suggests tense relations with them. Taylor's many duties and appointments often kept him from Hadleigh. He preached in several dioceses for the 1547 royal visitation and, at the lord mayor's request, in London at Whitsuntide 1548. He was made a canon of Rochester Cathedral in August 1547, archdeacon of Bury St Edmunds in May 1548, one of the six preachers of Canterbury and a commissioner to reform the ecclesiastical laws in 1551, and archdeacon of Cornwall in May 1552. He was also employed in the <i>sede vacante</i> administration of Norwich and Worcester in the early 1550s. In general Taylor served as Cranmer's troubleshooter and it is as that, not as Foxe's ideal pastor, that he is best regarded.<br>
<br>Taylor was implicated in Northumberland's plot to secure the throne for Lady Jane Grey, and the council ordered his arrest on 25 July 1553. He was released on 9 November, but his reformist views and contempt for the Roman church, which he called &#145;the purpld spirituall hore, the gowldin giltd harrand drab&#146;  (Craig, &#145;Marginalia&#146;, 415&#150;16), made a subsequent arrest inevitable. He refused to flee, writing later that &#145;<i>verbum Dei</i> made us goo to London&#146;  (ibid., 414) when the council ordered his arrest on 26 March 1554. He was held in the king's bench prison for several months, during which time Gardiner examined him at St Mary Overie, Southwark. These examinations were dominated by spirited but inconclusive debates over transubstantiation and clerical celibacy. His views also appear in his prison letters, in which he rejected transubstantiation, affirmed that the pope was Antichrist and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was sufficient in all matters of doctrine and salvation, and supported the oath of supremacy. Writing to his wife he defended justification by faith, attacked the mass as &#145;spiritual whoredom&#146;, and denounced transubstantiation for contradicting scripture and the creed on the location of Christ's body and for making Christ a &#145;cake-god&#146;  (Brown, 87&#150;92).<br>
<br>Taylor once wrote in his <span class="roman">bible</span> that &#145;preachars must be bowld and not mylk mowthed&#146;  (Craig, &#145;Marginalia&#146;, 420) and he was certainly that. But although he had a reputation for learning Taylor did not publish. His views are known from accounts of his examinations  (BL, Harleian MS 590, fols. 64<i>r</i>&#150;68<i>r</i>), marginalia in a Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span> that he annotated from the late 1540s until his death, and a handful of letters&#151;one to Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer in his own hand  (BL, Add. MS 19400, fol. 29) and copies of four written from prison (published by Bickersteth in 1837). He was also probably the author of the anonymous letter from &#145;the faithfull in Suffolke&#146; to Nicholas Shaxton following Shaxton's 1546 recantation  (Crowley). No contemporary paintings or drawings survive, but a favourable eyewitness to his examinations described Taylor as &#145;a man of comely personage, and good stature, his color good, his berd grate and somewhat short cut&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 590, fol. 64<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>On 22 January 1555 Taylor was condemned to death, and on 4 February was degraded by Bonner. He was executed on 9 February on Aldham Common, north of Hadleigh. Foxe's vivid description of Taylor's progress to his execution includes his humorous remarks about the worms of Hadleigh churchyard being cheated of the opportunity to feast on his large carcass. He also distributed alms to the local poor. Before his death many lamented while others treated him roughly. Foxe's account suggests that Taylor was killed by a blow to the head, after which his body was burnt. The place is marked by a rough-hewn stone bearing the inscription &#145;1555 D. Tayler in defending that was good at this plas left his blode&#146;  (Brown, 1), as well as by an obelisk erected by public subscription in 1819.<br>
