<span class="headword">Alford,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1592), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and member of parliament</span>, was the second son of Robert Alford (<i>d</i>. 1546) and his wife, Anne Brydges. He gained a BA degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1549 and was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1550. Until 1555 he was clerk of the market in Oxford and a proctor in the vice-chancellor's court. The civil law was apparently his chosen career, and during 1557&#150;9 he studied in Italy. He wrote some short works, for instance on legal reform and trading corporations, but later hopes to be allowed to write an account of Elizabeth I's reign, with access to the papers of Lord Burghley, were never fulfilled. By 1562 he had married Agnes, widow of Augustine de Augustinis, physician to Thomas Wolsey; they appear to have had one son.<br>
<br>With <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24450/', "Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst")</script>, as a cousin and constant support, perhaps even financially, Alford was ostensibly well placed for advancement, and he was able to secure election to borough seats in Lancashire, Cornwall, Berkshire, and Sussex so that he sat in nine of the thirteen parliamentary sessions of Elizabeth's reign. Beyond this, the minor offices of rector in Croxton, Cambridgeshire, and chanter at Lincoln Cathedral were the only posts to come his way. Alford obviously aroused distrust. He may have gone to Italy in order to escape the regime of Queen Mary, and his support of the protestant settlement of 1559 was clear, but his credit suffered because his Catholic wife practised her faith within his household. A visit to France, the details of which remain unclear, also led to the accusation that he had associated with the supporters of Mary, queen of Scots, there: this may account for the apparent loss of royal favour by the mid-1570s.<br>
<br>Alford was probably not popular in parliament. He was unsympathetic to frequent and widely supported calls for reform of the church. In the parliament of 1584&#150;5 he opposed a bill for improving the quality of the clergy, arguing that the Commons should not take it upon themselves to interfere in church matters, but also pointing out that many benefices were too poor to support well-qualified men. In the next parliament too (1586&#150;7) he made his hostility to parliamentary involvement clear and argued that the problem of clerical inadequacy be left to the church itself.<br>
<br>For some time Alford was in a minority on the question of what to do about Mary Stuart. While most members were unreservedly against Mary by 1572, Alford insisted that her being privy to the plots against Elizabeth was a necessary condition of her guilt. He was also uncertain of the propriety of trying her, a foreign sovereign, in England. This was anathema to the predominant mentality of the time, and a stark contrast to the later argument of Job Throckmorton that parliament had full competence in the matter. The hostile reception of Alford's views led him to reflect that he was being denied the parliamentary right of free speech. Though he shared this caution about the Scottish queen with Elizabeth herself, by 1586&#150;7 he had come to support the general clamour for Mary's execution. He was also in favour of the view that Elizabeth should accept the sovereignty of the Netherlands.<br>
<br>These were major issues of continuing importance. Yet Alford, in common with many of his fellow members of parliament, made a more broadly based contribution to the business of the House of Commons. He claimed later in life that he had &#145;done my country some good, whereunto we are called&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 1.335). He appears to have sat on Commons committees which dealt with a wide range of bills, and a particular concern with vagabonds and the poor was sustained in the 1570s and 1580s. Though (typically) unsympathetic to vagabonds, he was also anxious in the 1584&#150;5 parliament to preserve what he called the liberties of the common subjects. He thought that a bill that proposed to limit the keeping of hawks, ferrets, and so on to substantial landholders would threaten these. The measure, he feared, would cause discontent because it would deny &#145;our poor neighbours&#146; their traditional pastimes. Alford was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, on 3 September 1592.<br>
