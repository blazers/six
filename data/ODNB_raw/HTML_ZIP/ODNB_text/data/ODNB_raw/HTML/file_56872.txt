</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rejlander,  Oscar Gustaf</span>  (1813&#150;1875), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born probably in Sweden; little is known about his parents or his early life. When on 30 September 1862 Rejlander married Mary Bull (<i>b</i>. 1837/8), daughter of George Bull, stonemason, the marriage certificate registered his father as Carl Gustaf Rejlander, an officer in the Swedish army. According to O. G. Rejlander's obituaries he studied art informally in Rome in the 1830s and supported himself there by working as a portrait painter and copyist of old masters. The reasons for his move to England remain a subject of speculation: one obituary states that it was &#145;a romantic love adventure&#146; with an Englishwoman which brought him to Britain  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 22.55) but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim. Rejlander can be placed in Lincoln in 1841; by 1845 he had settled in Wolverhampton, at 42 Darlington Street, where he opened a painter's studio.<br>
<br>It was in Rome in 1852 that Rejlander had first seen photographic reproductions of art and marvelled at their precision. He took up photography in 1853 after an afternoon's tutelage by Nicholaas Henneman, formerly the assistant of William Henry Fox Talbot. His decision to learn photography for himself was based upon his desire to make studies from life which would assist him in his painting; however, he quickly became absorbed in the expressive potential of photography and, in 1855, began to exhibit his photographic compositions. In the same year, he won a bronze medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition; from then until his death in 1875 his photographs were regularly accepted for exhibition and reviewed in the photographic and periodical press. These images consisted of portraits, landscapes, studies from the nude, anatomical studies, <i>t&ecirc;tes d'expression</i>, art studies, and subject pictures. Of the latter, it was his genre photographs which earned him his reputation as one of Britain's leading photographers. In photographs such as <span class="italic">Oh Lift me the Veil of the Future</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">Please Give Us a Copper!</span> (1860s, both National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford, Royal Photographic Society collection) he demonstrated his skill for eliciting from his models naturalistic expressions and poses which sustained a narrative and aroused in the viewer the sentiment appropriate to the scene before them. His <span class="italic">Night in Town</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Homeless</span> and <span class="italic">Poor Jo</span>; <i>c</i>.1860, National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Royal Photographic Society collection), depicting a child in rags huddled on a doorstep, was used by the Shaftesbury Society for over a hundred years to highlight the plight of homeless children.<br>
<br>The first photograph which Rejlander exhibited was <span class="italic">Group Printed from Three Negatives</span>. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he did not view &#145;combination-printing&#146; as a necessary evil and, in 1857, decided to demonstrate its creative potential by submitting a large-scale composition to the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition. It took him six weeks, and thirty negatives, to produce <span class="italic">The Two Ways of Life</span> (1857, two versions, National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Royal Photographic Society collection), a large-scale (31 in. &times; 16 in.), elaborate allegory of the choice between the life of virtue and that of vice. The suggestion that photography could fulfil the didactic, morally elevated role ascribed to high art was one which divided the critics: the photograph quickly became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Rejlander's use of semi-clad models to personify a number of the vices proved particularly controversial. Prince Albert, already a patron of Rejlander's, purchased three versions, but this royal endorsement did not prevent the council of the Photographic Society of Scotland from initially refusing to exhibit the photograph on moral grounds. When they did exhibit it in 1858, a curtain was drawn over the offending portion.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1862 Rejlander moved to London and settled in Malden Road. This move brought him into close contact with those who were promoting his exhibition photographs as proof that photography was a fine art. Their insistent claims drowned out Rejlander's own opinion that photography was neither a fine art nor a science but a medium <i>sui generis</i>; to his mind, photography and painting were but two of the many media in which the artist could express his inventive faculty. His <span class="italic">Infant Photography Receiving a Fee from the Painter</span> (<i>c</i>.1860) challenged the hypocrisy of artists who publicly claimed that art owed nothing to photography while privately using photographs as studies. For Rejlander, artists had as much to learn from photography about observation and draughtsmanship as photographers had to learn from painting about composition and expression.<br>
<br>Contemporary descriptions of Rejlander, &#145;the father of art photography&#146;, seek to stress his geniality, humour, and childlike enthusiasm for his art  (<span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, 19.42). He had blue-green eyes, a balding pate fringed by long sandy hair, a red moustache, and full beard. He believed that he resembled the Italian patriot Garibaldi and he appears as his hero in two of his own photographs. In his composite self-portrait <span class="italic">The Artist Rejlander Introduces the Volunteer Rejlander</span> (<i>c</i>.1871, National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Royal Photographic Society collection) he appears as both a bohemian painter and a corporal of the 38th (Middlesex) volunteer regiment, Artists' company. He also appears together with his wife as the personification of married love in his photograph <span class="italic">Happy Days</span> (<i>c</i>.1872&#150;3, National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Royal Photographic Society collection). Mary Rejlander was a frequent model for her husband and probably worked as his assistant.<br>
<br>As a portrait photographer Rejlander photographed several illustrious sitters, including Alfred Tennyson (<i>c</i>.1863, National Portrait Gallery, London), Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) (1863), Henry Taylor (<i>c</i>.1863, National Portrait Gallery, London), Charles Darwin (<i>c</i>.1871), Gustave Dor&eacute; (<i>c</i>.1868, National Portrait Gallery, London, and National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Royal Photographic Society collection), and Prince Albert (<i>c</i>.1861, National Portrait Gallery, London, and Victoria and Albert Museum, London). When, in the mid-1860s, the majority of photographers repudiated their claims to be recognized as artists in favour of staking their claim to professional status on their technical expertise, Rejlander continued to eschew the latter in favour of invention and effect. Despite inspiring a generation of photographers to produce pictorial photographs, his own endeavours became subject to the charge of careless manipulation and his reputation suffered accordingly.<br>
<br>In 1868 Rejlander's fortunes began to revive: he was favourably reviewed in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> and, a year later, opened a new and richly furnished studio opposite Victoria Station in central London. It was soon after this move that Charles Darwin, frustrated in his quest for adequate illustrations of the primary human emotions, sought him out after having seen his photographs in a shop window. Rejlander supplied Darwin with nine illustrations for his <span class="italic">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</span> (1872), six of which he posed for himself. The photograph illustrating &#145;mental distress&#146;, that of an infant boy wailing, became known as &#145;Ginx's Baby&#146; after the popular novel by James E. Jenkins; a contemporary, H. B. Pritchard, claimed that it earned Rejlander &pound;5000 in a year. This period of prosperity was, however, short-lived.<br>
<br>In endeavouring to be both a painter and a photographer, Rejlander found himself increasingly isolated from the fraternities which he hoped to unite. In 1870 a raid upon a print dealer's shop resulted in his art studies being seized with other &#145;obscene&#146; material. About this time he contracted the &#145;wasting and painful disease&#146; which led to his death on 18 January 1875 at his home, 23 East Cottages, Clapham  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 22.54); he was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 23 January. He left his widow, in the words of one commentator, &#145;little more than the memory of a reputation, a few debts, and a little knot of friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photogram</span>, 59).<br>
