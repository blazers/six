<span class="headword">Bradbridge,  William</span>  (1507&#150;1578), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was born in Chichester, the son of William Bradbridge (<i>d</i>. 1546), a wealthy mercer, three times mayor of Exeter, and his wife Alice. His father, who was on good terms with the dean and chapter of Chichester, had fourteen children; one son was brought up to succeed him, while William and Augustine were destined for the church. A sister, Alice, married a successful London draper, established herself as a silkwoman, and commissioned one of the earliest family portraits in England [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98431/', "Barnham, Alice")</script>]. In the mid-1520s William was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford, and became a fellow there in 1529, the year in which he determined for his BA. The only college office he appears to have held was that of supervisor of ale in 1532. He had vacated his fellowship by 1534 and in 1535 was collated to the vicarage of Willingdon, Sussex, by the dean and chapter of Chichester. In 1539 he was admitted to the degree of BTh. In 1542 Willingdon was replaced by the Sussex vicarage of East Dean, followed in 1547 first by that of West Thorney and then by the rectory of West Tarring, also in Sussex. He held the latter until he became a bishop.<br>
<br>Bradbridge appears to have weathered all the changes in religion of the mid-sixteenth century, remaining in England and in post throughout both Edward's and Mary's reigns, although his brother Augustine was among the Marian exiles. In 1554 William became warden of St Mary's Hospital, Chichester, while on 17 March that year he was instituted prebendary of Lyme and Halstock in Salisbury Cathedral. He renewed his links with Chichester Cathedral when on 7 January 1559 he was installed as prebendary of Sutton there, and in 1562 succeeded Augustine as chancellor of that diocese. Later that year he is recorded as selling old vestments and other furnishings in London to raise money for the chapter. William Bradbridge may well have owed much of his preferment after 1558 to the influence of his brother, and also to the favour of William Barlow, bishop of Chichester from 1559 to 1568. Not only did Augustine marry Barlow's eldest daughter, but he and William seem to have been the only members of his chapter whom the bishop felt able to trust with tasks of discipline and reform.<br>
<br>It is possible that Barlow's support put William Bradbridge into the circle of patronage around Sir William Cecil&#151;explaining, perhaps, why on 29 March 1563 he was presented by the crown to the deanery of Salisbury. In the same year he aligned himself with the reformers in convocation by voting for the six articles proposing the abrogation of ceremonies, and signing the petition for the reformation of discipline. In 1565 he became rector of Ditchling, Sussex, regularizing his position in 1570 when he was dispensed to hold three benefices. In spite of his continuing connection with Sussex he was diligent at Salisbury in performing his duties as dean, regularly attending chapter meetings, and for several years held the position of keeper of the muniments, which required residence in the cathedral close.<br>
<br>It might well have looked as if his deanery was the most that Bradbridge would achieve, but early in 1571 he became bishop of Exeter. Royal assent was granted on 26 February and he was consecrated on 18 March. Well over sixty, he was one of the oldest men to be made a bishop under Elizabeth. His diocese was a poor one, and in 1572 he was dispensed to hold the livings of Lazant, Cornwall, and Newton Ferrers, Devon, <i>in commendam</i>. There were equivocal aspects to his religious position. He is unlikely to have pleased the godly in his diocese when within forty-eight hours of his consecration he made his 26-year-old nephew William Marston his chancellor. Yet he was also a firm supporter of the meetings of reformist clergymen known as &#145;prophesyings&#146;, and himself sometimes acted as their moderator, reporting to Archbishop Grindal in 1576 how &#145;Great profit groweth thereby, I do persuade myself, for that I see the people delight to hear and gladly do resort, the clergy become studious in the tongues and grow ripe in the Scriptures&#146;  (Collinson, 238). Nevertheless he had difficulties with both Catholics and puritans. In 1576 he failed to make any impression on a group of Cornish Catholics who obdurately refused to come to church, and a year later had to deal with the schoolmaster of Liskeard who caused scandal by denouncing as valueless oaths taken on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, &#145;because it is nothing but ink and paper&#146;  (Rowse, 334).<br>
<br>Bradbridge seems to have been an isolated figure as bishop. He usually lived not in his palace at Exeter but at Newton Ferrers, where he convened the episcopal audience court in the parsonage. He is not recorded as a preacher; indeed, after his death the second earl of Bedford likened him to a dumb dog. He attended parliament in 1571, 1572, and 1575, and at Christmas 1577 broke with his usual practice by attending the quarter sessions in Exeter. He also acted as visitor of Exeter College, Oxford. But much of his time was devoted to farming; by the time of his death he owned a flock of 100 sheep and lambs and some 3 dozen horses, pigs, and cattle. Some of his lay deputies, most notoriously Henry Borough, his sub-collector of taxes, took advantage of his absences from Exeter to line their own pockets. By 1577 the bishop had begun to suspect that he was being deceived. He was reassured by Borough and his associates, to the extent that Bradbridge &#145;rejoicing drank to the gentlemen, and said that he would not be indebted to the queen for anything&#146;  (Heal, &#145;Clerical tax collection&#146;, 116), but doubts soon recurred, and he initiated inquiries once more. Such precautions came too late, however, and when he died the bishop owed &pound;1235 to the exchequer, most of it for taxes embezzled by Borough.<br>
<br>Unmarried, and consequently without the support a wife could have given him, Bradbridge appears eventually to have found the burdens of his office too much, and on 11 March 1576 he wrote to Cecil, now Lord Burghley, asking to be allowed to return to his deanery at Salisbury, which he mistakenly believed was vacant: &#145;If it please your lordship to send me hence, and to restore me to the place from whence I came, you could never do me such a pleasure&#146;  (Strype, 2/2.35&#150;6). In the event Bradbridge stayed in office, and died suddenly and alone at Newton Ferrers on 27 June 1578. His poverty was such that his executors could not afford a fitting burial; he was interred on the north side of Exeter Cathedral choir.<br>
<br>Bradbridge published nothing, and his episcopate aroused little enthusiasm, either at the time or later. His younger contemporary John Hooker offered the lukewarm verdict that:<blockquote>he was a professor of divinitie, but not taken to be so well grounded as he persuaded himselfe, he was zelous in religion, but not so forwarde as he was wished to be. In his latter daies he delighted to dwell in the countrie, which was not so much to his liking, as troublesome to his clergie, &amp; to such as had anie sutes unto him. (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 3.1309)</blockquote>A century later a local historian described him, with some generosity, as &#145;a man only memorable for this, that nothing memorable is recorded of him saving that he well governed this church about eight years&#146;  (Izacke, 135&#150;6).<br>
