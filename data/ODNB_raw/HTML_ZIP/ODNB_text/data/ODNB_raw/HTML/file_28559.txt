<span class="headword">Waller,  John Francis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Jonathan Freke Slingsby]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1809&#150;1894), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Limerick, the third son of Thomas Maunsell Waller of Finnoe House, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Vereker. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1827, and graduated BA in 1831. He was called to the Irish bar in 1833, and while studying in the chambers of Joseph Chitty he began to contribute to periodicals.<br>
<br>Waller served in the court of chancery for some years, and in 1835 married Anna, the daughter of William Hopkins, with whom he had six daughters and two sons. He was one of the founders of the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, contributing prose and verse for more than forty years, and in 1845 succeeding Charles James Lever as its editor. He became well known under the pseudonym of Jonathan Freke Slingsby, and <span class="italic">The Slingsby Papers</span>, a collection of his comic and sentimental contributions, appeared in book form in 1852, and ran to several editions.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">The Slingsby Papers</span> marked the start of a prolific literary career. In 1852 Trinity College, Dublin, conferred the honorary degree of LLD on him in recognition of his literary and legal work, and later that year Waller published two volumes of poems, one, <span class="italic">Ravenscroft Hall</span>, under his own name, and the second, <span class="italic">St Patrick's Day in my Own Parlour</span>, under the Slingsby pseudonym. Further volumes appeared as <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">The Dead Bridal</span> (1856). From 1856 until 1861 he was honorary secretary of the Royal Dublin Society.<br>
<br>From 1857 until 1866 Waller edited and wrote many of the articles for the <span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography</span>. He was elected vice-president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1864. His biographical work led him to edit, with short biographies, <span class="italic">The Works of Oliver Goldsmith</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">The Illustrated Family Moore</span> (1866). He was appointed registrar of the rolls in 1867, and in 1870 he bought the ailing <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> from Sheridan Le Fanu for &pound;1700, selling it on to Kennington Cooke in its final year.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1870, Waller moved to London, where he contributed to <span class="italic">Cassell's Biographical Dictionary</span>, and continued to write. <span class="italic">Festival Tales</span> appeared in 1873, and <span class="italic">The Adventures of a Protestant in Search of a Religion</span> later that year, a work which was particularly popular in America, going through three editions in New York in a decade. In 1881 he published <span class="italic">Boswell and Johnson: their Companions and Contemporaries</span>. Waller died at his home, Windhill, near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on 19 January 1894.<br>
<br>Waller was best known for his verse, in particular &#145;Kitty Neil&#146;, which was anthologized in many collections of Irish poetry well into the twentieth century. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> commented that &#145;his thought was so clear and his verse so graceful that his lyrics lent themselves readily to music&#146;  (p. 149), and many of his poems were turned into popular songs. In 1874 a long article on Waller and his works appeared in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>, and was later reprinted as a pamphlet.<br>
