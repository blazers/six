<span class="headword">Denniston,  John Dewar</span>  (1887&#150;1949), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 4 March 1887, at Bareilly, India, the younger surviving son of James Lawson Denniston, of the Bengal civil service, and his wife, Laura Mary Davies. He attended the Dragon School, Oxford, and was a scholar of Winchester College and of New College, Oxford, where he gained a first class in classical moderations in 1908 and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1910. He was Craven scholar in 1909 and in 1913 was elected a fellow of Hertford College, where he remained for the rest of his life with the exception of the war years. In 1914 he was commissioned in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, served in France, and was twice wounded. He later transferred to the War Office and was appointed OBE for his services; he returned to the War Office again for the duration of the Second World War. He married on 5 July 1919 Mary Grace, daughter of Joseph John Morgan, solicitor, of London; there were no children.<br>
<br>Denniston ranked among the most gifted and distinguished classical scholars of his time. His principal publications include <span class="italic">Greek Literary Criticism</span> (1924), Cicero's <span class="italic">Philippics I and II</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Greek Particles</span> (1934; 2nd rev. edn, 1954; reprinted 1981); and Euripides' <span class="italic">Electra</span> (1939), one of the best extant editions of a Greek tragedy. <span class="italic">Greek Prose Style</span> appeared posthumously in 1952, and was reprinted in 1997; an Italian version by Enrico Renna, with excellent indexes, came out in 1993.<br>
<br>The quality of all Denniston's work was very high; but his greatest contribution to knowledge was his monumental book on the Greek particles. This is a work which bears comparison with the achievements of the great scholars of the past. It represents the exercise of an original and penetrating mind in a field of vast extent. The whole of classical Greek literature is explored; the examples (which number over 20,000) depend on Denniston's own reading and judgement, and their complexity is made intelligible by a lucid and accurate intellect, the myriad interpretations each the result of fresh and fine meditation. The style is vigorous, and the ideal humane. Denniston was concerned much less with linguistic schematism than with niceties of meaning: the Greek particles are keys to the undertones of meaning, and Denniston was the first to detect and interpret the undertones in thousands of passages of Greek prose and poetry. The book is indispensable in all fields of Greek literature, and it is difficult to see how it can ever be superseded.<br>
<br>Denniston was a joint editor of the first edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford Classical Dictionary</span> (1949), to which he contributed a masterly survey of Greek metre. His draft of an edition of Aeschylus's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> was completed after his death by Denys Page and appeared in 1957.<br>
<br>Denniston was among the most successful classical tutors of his time at Oxford, and tutors from other colleges sent their best students to him for final preparation before university scholarships. He required of his pupils keenness and honesty in their work and it then seemed no effort to him to treat them on terms of equality, whatever their intellectual gifts. He came to regard the tutorial hour as a matter of importance, almost of urgency, and could be outspoken in praise or blame, but always strove to impart something of his own love and understanding of the ancient world, and of his high ideals of scholarship. A considerable part of the work which he did with his pupils was published in <span class="italic">Some Oxford Compositions</span> (1949) of which he was a joint editor and a principal contributor. He was unsurpassed in the art of rendering English prose into classical Greek.<br>
<br>From his schooldays Denniston was devoted to music, and enjoyed playing tennis and, later, watching cricket, but his chief delight was in good conversation and in the happy home which was for many years a centre of lively entertainment in Oxford. For him, conversation meant argument on a stated theme. Through smaller talk he would growl absently; then a phrase would attract him, and with much brushing of the coat-lapel and lightening of the eyes he would attack. His mind was singularly clear and quick, his speech candid and forceful, almost violent. No quarter was given, nor yet offence. Ironical but not sarcastic, subtle but not sophistical, he left in the mind of the listener the impression of a powerful intellect controlled by good humour, a warm heart, and a profound inner modesty. He was a lifelong Liberal and an active and proselytizing member of the League of Nations Union. He watched with horror the rise of the dictators and was among the first to offer refuge in his home to exiles from Austria.<br>
<br>When the regius chair of Greek became vacant on the retirement of Gilbert Murray in 1936, Denniston was passed over in favour of E. R. Dodds. He was elected FBA in 1937 and proceeded DLitt at Oxford in 1949, shortly before his death, at The Beeches, Church Stretton, Shropshire, on 2 May 1949.<br>
