<span class="headword">Moulton,  Sarah Goodin Barrett</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Pinkie]</span>  (1783&#150;1795), <span class="occ">subject of a painting by Thomas Lawrence</span>, was born on 22 March 1783 at Little River, St James's, Jamaica. She was the only daughter and eldest of the four children of Charles Moulton (<i>d</i>. 1819), a merchant from Madeira, and his wife, Elizabeth (1763&#150;1830), daughter of Edward Barrett (1734&#150;1798) of Cinnamon Hill, St James's, and his wife, Judith. Sarah was baptized on 29 May 1783, named in memory of her mother's sister, Sarah Goodin Barrett, who had died as an infant two years previously; to her family she was known as Pinkie or Pinkey. Her maternal relatives were descended from Hersey Barrett, a lieutenant who had arrived in Jamaica with Oliver Cromwell's forces in 1655. By the eighteenth century the Barretts had become wealthy landowners, slave owners, and exporters of sugar cane and rum.<br>
<br>By 1789 Charles Moulton had left his wife, who subsequently raised their children with the help of other members of the Barrett family. In November 1791 Sarah's grandfather, Edward, engaged an Englishman, Francis Murphy, to act as tutor to her and her siblings for four years. Although Murphy had arrived in Jamaica by February 1792, Sarah and her two brothers, Edward (1785&#150;1857) and Samuel (1787&#150;1837), sailed to England in late September of that year in order to continue their education. Sarah was sent to Mrs Fenwick's school at Flint House, Greenwich, along with other children from Jamaican colonial families.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1793 Sarah's grandmother, Judith Barrett, wrote from Jamaica to her niece Elizabeth Barrett Williams, then living at Richmond Hill in Surrey, asking her to commission a portrait of &#145;my dear little Pinkey &hellip; as I cannot gratify my self with the Original, I must beg the favor of You to have her picture drawn at full Length by one of the best Masters, in an easy Careless attitude&#146; (quoted in Kelley and Hudson, 257). Sarah probably began sitting for Thomas Lawrence, painter-in-ordinary to George III, at his studio in Old Bond Street soon after the receipt of this letter on 11 February 1794. In this famous portrait, she appears to dance on a hillside, dressed in a white muslin dress and silk bonnet. It has been suggested that the background landscape either represents Richmond, the home of Elizabeth Williams whom Sarah would presumably have visited, or the Thames valley at Greenwich, where she was at school. Although the amount paid for the portrait is unknown, Lawrence was charging 160 guineas for a whole length at this date  (Garlick, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>Sarah Moulton died at Greenwich on 23 April 1795. A letter from her grandmother, dated 6 November 1794, mentions her recent recovery from a cough, which may have contributed to her death. She was buried on 30 April 1795 in the doctor's vault under the parish church of St Alfege, Greenwich. Her portrait by Lawrence was placed on display in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1795, which opened the day after her burial. The picture remained in the family's possession until 1910, passing at one point to Sarah's brother, Edward, father of the poet and writer Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It was purchased in 1926 by Duveen, the dealers, for 74,000 guineas, the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction at that date. Duveen sold it on to Henry E. Huntington the following year and it has since remained in the Huntington collection at San Marino, California. The enduring popularity of the image is evident in its frequent appearance in books, magazines, and articles as well as in its reproduction on a Cadbury's chocolate tin in 1928 and its inclusion in the <span class="roman">British Paintings</span> series of United Kingdom stamps, first issued in 1968. The painting has often been linked to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theories on childhood and even hailed as the first Romantic portrait.<br>
