<span class="headword">Benham,  William</span>  (1831&#150;1910), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 15 January 1831 at West Meon, near Petersfield, Hampshire, where his grandfather and his father, James Benham, successively held the position of village postmaster. He was educated until 1843 at the village school, built by the rector, Henry Vincent Bayley, who made him his secretary and taught him Greek and Latin. At his death in 1844 Bayley left instructions that the boy's education should be continued&#151;he was therefore trained as a schoolmaster at St Mark's College, Chelsea, under Derwent Coleridge. Among other places, he then taught at the Blue Coat School, Westminster, and as a private tutor. Then by his own exertions and the help of Archdeacon Bayley's family he was enabled in 1856 to attend the theological department of King's College, London, where the influence of F. D. Maurice permanently affected his religious position in the direction of attempted engagement with intellectual trends outside the church, such as evolutionism. In 1857 he was ordained deacon, and priest in 1858. He was appointed divinity tutor and lecturer in English literature at St Mark's, Chelsea, still under Derwent Coleridge, and remained there until in 1864 he became editorial secretary to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and professor of modern history at Queen's College, Harley Street, in succession to F. D. Maurice. At the same time he engaged in Sunday ministerial work as curate of St Lawrence Jewry, under Benjamin Morgan Cowie. On 4 January 1862 he married Louisa Marian Engelbach (1831/2&#150;1870), daughter of Lewis Edward Engelbach, esquire.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Benham's preaching attracted the attention of Archbishop Longley, who made him in 1867 first vicar of the newly formed parish of Addington, where the archbishop resided. The health of the primate was giving way. Benham assisted him as his private secretary during the anxious period of the first Lambeth conference in 1867, and was with him at his death in 1868. Partly to vindicate Longley, he entered the periphery of the Colenso controversy by seeking to publicize what he regarded as the true views of the conference against misrepresentations by Archbishop Robert Gray, who sought to claim its support for all his actions against Bishop Colenso of Natal. Comparative leisure at Addington enabled Benham to increase his literary work. He produced <span class="italic">The Church of the Patriarchs</span> in 1867 and an edition of William Cowper's poetry in 1870 (followed by one of his letters in 1884), worked on a commentary on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and published in 1873 his well-known <span class="italic">Companion to the Lectionary</span> (new edn, 1884).<br>
<br>For Tait, Longley's successor in the archbishopric, Benham developed &#145;a love that was filial in its nature &hellip; a case of genuine hero-worship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Church Times</span>). Tait gave him the Lambeth degree of BD, made him one of the six preachers of Canterbury, and in 1872 bestowed on him the important vicarage of Margate. Here Benham restored the parish church, was chairman of the first school board of the town, and made the Church Institute a centre of intellectual and spiritual life. He lectured there on church history and also on Charles Dickens, of whose liaison with Nelly Ternan he handed down the first clear hints to posterity after having become a confidant of hers at Margate. He now resigned his Queen's College chair, but remained on the college council. After the death of his first wife, in August 1870, he married Caroline Elizabeth Sandell (<i>b</i>. 1839/40) of Basing, Hampshire, on 9 January 1872. She outlived him.<br>
<br>As Benham complained of overwork at Margate (aggravated by his disputes with the Irvingists), in 1880 Tait made him vicar of Marden, and in 1882 he was appointed rector of St Edmund the King with St Nicholas Acons, Lombard Street, a benefice he held until his death. There Benham suffered from attacks by low-churchmen. His curate, at least, was accused of saying prayers for the dead at Lombard Street. <span class="italic">The Record</span> conceded in an obituary (5 August 1910) that he was &#145;never a High Churchman in the modern sense&#146;. Benham wrote that &#145;the Tractarian movement was an inestimable boon to English religion, in spite of all its errors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treasury</span>, 1, 1902&#150;3, 548). He had sought to play a mediatory role in the affair of C. H. Collette's attack on J. H. Newman. His personal letters, however, show very limited sympathy for Anglo-Catholicism. His own view of Lombard Street was: &#145;Our ritual is not very high. I moderated it as much as I could when I came there first, but continued what I felt able to fall in with, and so kept my congregation together&#146;  (Fulham MSS, F. Temple MS 22, fol. 349). At St Peter, London docks, on the other hand, he had been appalled in 1874 by a service full of interpolated mumblings and strange gestures&#151;&#145;simply the mass&#146;, he complained to the archbishop  (Tait MS 203, fol. 328). He deplored Christopher Wordsworth's degree of hostility to both Romans and nonconformists; to a large extent, his own position was equal tolerance of both. Tait, when asked Benham's party, thought that &#145;on the whole he belonged to the Benhamist school&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). A later archbishop, Randall Davidson, considered: &#145;People might or might not agree with him in opinion. They could hardly fail, if they knew him well, to respect and even love him as a man&#146;  (&#145;Foreword&#146; to <span class="italic">Letters of Peter Lombard</span>, iv).<br>
<br>Benham made St Edmund's Church a preaching centre of exceptional intellectual force and impartiality; <span class="italic">Lombard Street in Lent</span> (1894), the title of a course of addresses by various preachers, presented the kind of sermon which he thought a city church should supply in order to attract the businessman in the lunch hour. In 1888 Archbishop Benson made him honorary canon of Canterbury, and in 1898 Hartford University, USA, granted him the degree of DD. He was Boyle lecturer in 1897, and rural dean of East City from 1903 until his death.<br>
<br>Benham's literary activity was always great. He collaborated with Randall Davidson on the <span class="italic">Life of Archbishop Tait</span> (1891), having already (1879) edited the memoirs of Catherine and Craufurd Tait, his wife and son. Benham also edited the series of cheap reprints entitled the <span class="roman">Ancient and Modern Library of Theological Literature</span> and contributed substantially to the series <span class="roman">English Cathedrals</span>. But the characteristic work of the last twenty years of his life was the lightly written series of miscellaneous paragraphs which he contributed to the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> week by week under the heading &#145;Varia&#146; and with the signature of Peter Lombard, edited after his death by his daughter Ellen Baxter as <span class="italic">Letters of Peter Lombard</span> (1911). Benham's long involvement with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was unfortunately overshadowed in his last years by some bitterness arising from the death of another of his daughters by his first marriage, Marian, in an accident (in which Benham considered her superiors to have been negligent) during missionary work in India in 1902. He died at his home, 32 Finsbury Square, London, of heart failure on 30 July 1910, and was buried at Addington churchyard (near Archbishop Tait) on 4 August.<br>
