<span class="headword">Mainauduc,  John Boniot  de</span> <span class="st"> [John Boniot Demainauduc]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1797), <span class="occ">surgeon and animal magnetizer</span>, was born in Cork, the son of Elias Mainauduc (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1790), &#145;one of the greatest mathematicians in Europe&#146;, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (60, 1790, 575), but, more probably, a linen draper, of French protestant descent. After a classical education, probably in Cork, de Mainauduc studied anatomy under William Hunter. In 1769 he became a pupil and dresser at St George's Hospital, and in 1770 he studied midwifery at Westminster Lying-in Hospital. After a further period of medical training, he opened an apothecary's shop in 1775. In 1777 he became a member of the Company of Surgeons, and resigned his share of his apothecary business to practise surgery and midwifery. On 17 March 1778 on the recommendation of John Leake and George Fordyce, who had taught him, he was awarded the degree of MD from King's College at Aberdeen. He started teaching anatomy and midwifery, but although he continued studying medicine, he was denied entry to the College of Physicians as a surgeon.<br>
<br>In 1782 de Mainauduc went to Paris to seek employment as a royal physician, and in 1784 gained a necessary French qualification at Rheims. But after a dispute over his intended position, he approached Franz Mesmer, who reportedly refused to teach him, notwithstanding the offer of a fee of 200 guineas. Instead he studied animal magnetism under Mesmer's former colleague turned rival, Charles Deslon. By 1785 de Mainauduc was installed in prestigious Bloomsbury Square, London, where he soon became Britain's leading animal magnetizer. He briefly promoted the Hygiaean Society, which stressed the benefits of helping the poor, and published a proposal for its establishment in 1785. But he achieved far greater success by advertising his lectures and therapeutic treatments for wealthy patients. He reputedly earned a fortune, charging between 10 and 50 guineas for his courses on animal magnetism, whose details he obliged his students to swear not to reveal. He taught in Bristol in 1788 and 1789, and probably supplemented his income by tours to other provincial centres.<br>
<br>De Mainauduc attracted several hundred patients and pupils to Bloomsbury Square, including members of the aristocracy (such as the duchess of Devonshire, the prince of Wales, and the duke of Gloucester), the newly wealthy wives of Quaker industrialists, rival medical men, and occult enthusiasts (including the artists Philip de Loutherbourg and Richard Cosway, and the governor of Gibraltar, Charles Rainsford). De Mainauduc's basic technique resembled hypnotism. Placing himself opposite his patient&#151;usually a woman&#151;he stared intently into her eyes, and moved his hands round her body without touching her. Many women experienced a &#145;crisis&#146;&#151;manifested as convulsions, hysteria, or sleep&#151;followed by a calm warmth; some of them also claimed that chronic physical ailments were alleviated.<br>
<br>De Mainauduc died suddenly on 22 March 1797 in Bloomsbury Square. The following year his lectures were published, probably by his assistant, Ann Prescott (who may have been his wife). This book describes a comprehensive scheme of health based, like those of many medical contemporaries, on maintaining the body's equilibrium and the free circulation of atomic particles. With a vitalist insistence that life depends on an immaterial principle, de Mainauduc explained how, with God's acquiescence, the mind could control the body. A magnetic therapist supposedly used his own &#145;volition&#146; to divert diseased atoms emanating from a sick person's body and restore natural harmony.<br>
<br>Marginalized at the time as a quack, de Mainauduc has most often been portrayed as a Mesmeric charlatan. However, he was medically well qualified: his career and his teaching resembled those of some eminent medical contemporaries, who were similarly competing for a wealthy clientele. In contrast with Mesmer, he never used magnetic equipment for treating his patients, and there is no evidence linking him with radical activism. Particularly after the French Revolution, hostile pamphlets ridiculed de Mainauduc and other animal magnetizers. <span class="italic">Animal Magnetism</span>, the title of a popular pirated farce by Elizabeth Inchbald, became a versatile term of abuse for mocking physicians and natural philosophers, as well as religious and political factions. Robert Southey and other defenders of the British establishment converted de Mainauduc into a symbol of subversive French practices.<br>
