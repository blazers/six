<span class="headword">Bedford,  William Kirkpatrick Riland</span>  (1826&#150;1905), <span class="occ">antiquary and genealogist</span>, born at Sutton Coldfield rectory on 12 July 1826, was the eldest of five sons of William Riland Bedford (1794/5&#150;1843), rector of Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and his wife, Grace Campbell, daughter of Charles Sharpe of Hoddam, Dumfriesshire. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, a Scottish antiquarian, was his maternal uncle. After education at Sutton Coldfield grammar school, Bedford won a Queen's scholarship at Westminster School in 1840, and qualified for a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. An attack of scarlet fever prevented him from taking up the studentship, and on 5 June 1844 he matriculated as a commoner at Brasenose College. In 1847 he was secretary of the Oxford Union. He graduated BA in 1848 and proceeded MA in 1852. In 1849 he became curate of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and in 1850 he was ordained priest and succeeded an uncle, Dr Williamson, as rector of Sutton Coldfield. He held the post for forty-two years, and was rural dean for twenty-five. He was also chaplain of the grand lodge of freemasons in 1861.<br>
<br>On 18 September 1851 Bedford married Maria Amy, the youngest daughter of Joseph Houson (<i>d</i>. 1890) of Southwell, Nottinghamshire. They had seven sons and three daughters. His second marriage was to Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1871/2), daughter of Denis Browne, and took place on 27 November 1900.<br>
<br>Bedford was an acknowledged authority on the antiquities of Sutton Coldfield, which he described in <span class="italic">Three Hundred Years of a Family Living, being a History of the Rilands of Sutton Coldfield</span> (1889) and <span class="italic">The Manor of Sutton, Feudal and Municipal</span> (1901). He was well versed in heraldry and genealogies, and was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. From 1878 to 1902 he was chaplain of the order of St John of Jerusalem and in his capacity of official genealogist, he compiled many works dealing with the history and regulations of the knights hospitallers, including <span class="italic">Malta and the Knights</span> (1870; 2nd edn, 1894), <span class="italic">Notes on the Old Hospitals of the Order of St John of Jerusalem</span> (1881), and a history of the English hospitallers (1902), in collaboration with R. Holbeche.<br>
<br>Bedford was a keen cricketer in the early days of the game. On 20 July 1856 he founded the Free Foresters, an amateur wandering club with headquarters at Sutton Coldfield, and he recorded the fortunes of the club in his <span class="italic">Annals of the Free Foresters from 1856</span> (1895). He was also an expert archer and in 1849 joined the Woodmen of Arden at Meriden, Warwickshire, where he frequently attended meetings, and won the Arden medal on 16 July 1857. In 1885 he published <span class="italic">Records of the Woodmen of Arden from 1785</span>, and he later contributed to the volume on <span class="italic">Archery</span> in the <span class="roman">Badminton Library</span> series (1894). In addition to the works already mentioned, his chief publications were a <span class="italic">Memoir of C. K. Sharpe</span>, his uncle, written from family papers (1888), <span class="italic">The Blazon of Episcopacy</span>, his first work, published in 1858, and <span class="italic">Outcomes of Old Oxford</span> (1899).<br>
<br>Bedford died at his home, 209 Fordwych Road, Cricklewood, on 23 January 1905; his ashes were buried after cremation at Golders Green.<br>
