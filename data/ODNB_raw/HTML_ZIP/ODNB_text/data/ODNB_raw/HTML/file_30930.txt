<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Churchill,  Peter Morland</span>  (1909&#150;1972), <span class="occ">special operations officer</span>, was born in Amsterdam on 14 January 1909, the eldest of four children (three sons and a daughter) of William Algernon Churchill, British consul there, who ten years later was consul-general in Milan, and his wife, Violet Myers. He was educated at Malvern School, in Switzerland, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he got a pass degree and a half blue for ice hockey, a game he several times played for England. He was British pro-consul in Oran in 1933&#150;4.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1940 Churchill was commissioned into the intelligence corps, and served with the independent French section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE); he became a captain in May 1942. He distinguished himself that spring in the tricky and dangerous task of ferrying other agents ashore on to the Mediterranean coast of France from submarines or small boats at night. He had been to France himself in January 1942, to carry messages and to find out who &#145;Carte&#146; was. Carte turned out to be Andr&eacute; Girard, a painter at Antibes who claimed to control a secret army over 200,000 strong. On 27&#150;28 August Churchill was parachuted into France to establish liaison with this army. In his new role he was almost entirely ineffective, save that he organized the reception on the riviera of several more parties of agents. Carte's army turned out to be merely notional and soon after the German occupation of France on 11 November 1942 Girard's followers dispersed. Churchill retired to St Jorioz, a small resort near Annecy in Savoy, with his wireless operator Adolph Rabinovitch and his courier Odette Marie C&eacute;line Sansom [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58213/', "Hallowes, Odette Marie C&#233;line (1912&#150;1995)")</script>], wife of Roy Sansom (with whom she had three daughters) and daughter of Gaston Brailly. He returned to England by light aircraft for further orders on 23&#150;24 March 1943. There he was told that Odette Sansom was engaged in dangerous talks with a supposed German colonel, and ordered to avoid her when he returned. However, she received him when he was parachuted back on 14&#150;15 April, and on the following night her German acquaintance&#151;Sergeant H. Bleicher of the Abwehr&#151;arrested them both, finding him fast asleep.<br>
<br>With more skill than truth, Churchill passed her off as his wife and himself as a cousin of the British prime minister. He survived two years' severe imprisonment, partly in Fresnes, partly in German concentration camps. After the war he was appointed to the DSO (1946) and awarded a French Croix de Guerre and L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He married Odette Sansom, in 1947, and in her wake became something of a newspaper hero; she divorced him in 1955. He married second in 1956 Irene Mary (&#145;Jane&#146;), daughter of William E. Hoyle, sometime manager of the SPCK bookshop in Exeter; she survived him. He had no children.<br>
<br>Churchill wrote three light-hearted books on his wartime adventures: <span class="italic">Of their own Choice</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Duel of Wits</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">The Spirit in the Cage</span> (1954). He also wrote a novel, <span class="italic">By Moonlight</span> (1958), on the Gli&egrave;res Maquis which he had helped to arm; and a short travel guide, <span class="italic">All about the French Riviera</span> (1960), concerning the area where he spent his closing years, as an estate agent. He lived at Le Rouret, about 12 miles west of Cannes, and died of cancer in Cannes on 1 May 1972.<br>
