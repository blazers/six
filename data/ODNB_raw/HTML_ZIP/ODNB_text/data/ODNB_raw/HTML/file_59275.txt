<span class="headword">Benmohel,  Nathan Lazarus</span>  (1803&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Hebrew and German scholar</span>, was born in Hamburg, Germany, son of Rabbi Elieza Lazi (1741&#150;1841), presiding judge, or <i>dayan</i>, of Posen, and the united congregations of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck. His mother was the daughter of Rabbi Todros Munk of Posen. Benmohel arrived in Dublin about 1827, accompanied by his elder brother, Alexander Lazarus, formerly secretary and preacher in the Portsmouth Jewish community, and Alexander's wife, Rosa.<br>
<br>After private tuition and matriculation, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 February 1832; he won prizes for answering in Hebrew in 1835 and three times in 1836. Having subscribed to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> of the Church of England, he graduated BA in 1836. Benmohel was the first person of the Jewish faith to graduate from a British university open only to Anglicans. In June 1846 he took his MA degree. He taught German at Trinity College from 1839 to 1842, deputizing for the professor of French and German during illness, and appears to have taught Hebrew privately. He finished in 1830, but never published, a work entitled &#145;Orthographia Hebraeo Anglicana&#146;, and was the author of a number of scholarly translations from the Hebrew. In 1851 he read a paper to the Royal Irish Academy, published in the proceedings of the academy, on &#145;etymological criticism&#146;. His certificate of entry into Trinity College, his master's diploma, and two letters written by him were displayed at the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition in London in 1887.<br>
<br>In spite of his descent from a rabbinical and communally minded family, Benmohel acquired a reputation for unorthodoxy and for being very lax in observance. He held no office in the Dublin congregation, and appears to have had little to do with his co-religionists. He died at Sandycove, Dublin, on 22 December 1869. Although he had conformed some time after entering Trinity College, he was allowed to be buried on the periphery of the Jewish cemetery at Ballybough out of respect for his sister-in-law, to whom he had frequently expressed his wish to be buried there.<br>
