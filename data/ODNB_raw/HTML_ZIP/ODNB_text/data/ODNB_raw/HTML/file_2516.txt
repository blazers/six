<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackburne,  Lancelot</span>  (1658&#150;1743), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born on 10 December 1658 in London, the son of Richard Blackburne, a gentleman of London, and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2517/', "Richard Blackburne")</script>. He was educated at Westminster School, which he entered as a king's scholar in 1671. On leaving Westminster he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 20 October 1676, and was also that year elected a student (fellow) of the college. He graduated BA in 1680, and in 1681, having been ordained, went to the West Indies. He received permission to proceed MA <i>in absentia</i>, which he did by a decree of convocation on 28 January 1684. He was at that time at Nevis, in the king's service. The precise nature of Blackburne's services to the crown remains obscure. A list of payments for &#145;Secret Services&#146; of Charles II in 1681 notes that &pound;20 was paid &#145;To Launcelott Blackburne, clerk, bounty, for his transportation to Antego&#146;  (Akerman, 42).<br>
<br>Having returned from his travels, Blackburne married Catherine (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1726), daughter of William Talbot of Stourton Castle, Staffordshire, and widow of Walter Littleton of Lichfield, Staffordshire, on 2 September 1684 at the Savoy Chapel. She was the elder sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26945/', "William Talbot")</script>, later bishop successively of Oxford, Salisbury, and Durham. There is no indication in Blackburne's will that the couple had any children.<br>
<br>Three months after his marriage Blackburne was presented to the rectory of Camerton, Somerset, on 26 November 1684. Though himself a whig, he cultivated the patronage of Jonathan Trelawny, the high-church bishop of Exeter, and was rewarded with a canonry at Exeter in 1691, the first of several preferments in the diocese that also included the rectory of Calstock, Cornwall, in 1697, and the vicarage of Alternon, Cornwall, in 1699. He was appointed subdean of Exeter on 9 January 1695, and in this capacity wrote to Bishop Trelawny recounting the evidence given at a witch trial at Exeter in 1696 (a copy of the letter is printed in <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>). He was not without enemies in Exeter, however, and despite the support of influential friends was forced to resign his subdeanery in 1702 following allegations of a scandal, the nature of which is uncertain. Francis Atterbury wrote to Trelawny in support of Blackburne in October 1703, noting that:<blockquote>his enemies have been so industrious in spreading and fixing that black scandal, that he would find but a very cold and mortifying reception here, till his friends have made a little way for him, by removing men's prejudices, and clearing up matters to his service. (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 1.253)</blockquote>His position had, however, improved sufficiently that following the death of his successor he was reinstalled as subdean on 27 July 1704. During his time as subdean Blackburne came to the notice of the dean of Exeter, William Wake. On Wake's elevation to the bishopric of Lincoln in 1705, Blackburne was appointed his successor as dean. Blackburne maintained the favour of the ministry by keeping a watchful eye on the local gentry who were thought to be disaffected to the government. In 1715 he added to his growing collection of preferments by becoming archdeacon of Cornwall.<br>
<br>After Wake had been translated to Canterbury, Blackburne continued to benefit from the patronage of the new archbishop. Wake nominated Blackburne to accompany George I as the king's chaplain on his visit to Hanover in 1716. This was an important appointment, and the position came to be seen as the precursor to elevation to the bench of bishops. In 1717 Blackburne was duly elevated to the bishopric of Exeter, although he did not succeed in obtaining &#145;a prebend of Westminster when one should fall vacant&#146; which he had requested so that he might have a convenient house when attending parliament  (Sykes, 150). He took his parliamentary duties seriously and was a strong supporter of the whig government in parliament, siding, for example, with the ministry and against his erstwhile patron Wake in voting for the bill introduced by James Stanhope, Earl Stanhope, for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> in December 1718. He was appointed lord high almoner in 1723. It was no doubt Blackburne's political loyalties which recommended him to Edmund Gibson, bishop of London and Walpole's ecclesiastical adviser, by whose influence he was translated on 19 October 1724 to the archbishopric of York, a position he held for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>While Blackburne was assiduous in executing his political duties, he was less diligent in performing his spiritual functions. During his tenure at York he appears to have conducted no confirmations. Initially he did ordain in person, although he did so only in July, August, and September, during his summer residence at Bishopthorpe, and after 1733 he ceased to ordain in person at all, but gave candidates letters dimissory to be ordained by other bishops. He attended instead to political matters, civil and ecclesiastical, and kept a Westminster residence in Downing Street. He did, however, take seriously the exercise of his ecclesiastical patronage, particularly in promoting the interests of loyal whigs, and he also resorted to the courts to defend the prerogatives and interests of the archbishopric of York against encroachments. His undoubted presence as a court bishop, moreover, gives credibility to the story which attributes to the archbishop's influence the rise of Joseph Butler, the moral philosopher and future bishop, from ecclesiastical obscurity. Butler had given up his preachership at the Rolls Chapel and had for ten years ministered in the northern parish of Stanhope. It is said that Queen Caroline enquired of Blackburne whether Butler was not dead, to which he is supposed to have replied, &#145;No, madam, he is not <i>dead</i>, but <i>buried</i>&#146;, thereby prompting the queen to appoint him her clerk of the closet, or private chaplain.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, however, Blackburne's reputation, both during his lifetime and subsequently, has been characterized, whether justifiably or not, more by unverifiable rumour and scandal than by his political and ecclesiastical accomplishments. A story was told that while in the West Indies he had served on a buccaneering expedition against the Spanish, and took his part of the booty. It was said that one old buccaneer returned to England and asked after his old chum Blackburne, only to be told he was now archbishop of York. Another story, recounted by James Granger, also illustrates the very worldly reputation which Blackburne enjoyed. The archbishop, it was alleged, was conducting a visitation to St Mary's Church in Nottingham. It was said that Blackburne &#145;had ordered some of the &hellip; attendants, to bring him pipes and tobacco, and some liquor into the vestry for his refreshment after the <i>fatigue</i> of confirmation&#146;. The rector of the church, hearing of the orders, &#145;remonstrated with the archbishop upon the impropriety of his conduct&#146; and told Blackburne that &#145;his vestry should not be converted into a smoking-room&#146;  (Malcolm, 199). The apparent failure of Blackburne to perform any confirmations while archbishop of York, however, calls into question the reliability of this account.<br>
<br>Blackburne was also alleged to have fathered <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12789/', "Thomas Hayter")</script>, bishop of Norwich. Horace Walpole described Hayter as:<blockquote>natural son of Blackbourn, the jolly old Archbishop of York, who had all the manners of a man of quality, though he had been a buccaneer, and was a clergyman; but he retained nothing of his first profession, except his seraglio. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 1.74&#150;5)</blockquote>It must be acknowledged that Blackburne was particularly munificent in showering preferments on Hayter, a younger man, and that Hayter inherited a large portion of Blackburne's considerable estate. An item in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1822) pretended to demonstrate that Blackburne was not Hayter's father by citing Hayter's baptismal entry in the parish register of Chagford, Devon, for 17 November 1702; it reads &#145;son of George Hayter, Rector of this parish, and of Grace, his wife&#146;, although this can hardly be said definitively to settle the question.<br>
<br>Soon after his death Blackburne was the subject of a piece of scurrilous and satirical verse entitled <span class="italic">Priest-Craft and Lust, or, Lancelot to his Ladies, an Epistle from the Shades</span> (1743), which had him lamenting:<blockquote>
<div>No longer thro' the Town I range with raging Flame<br>
</div>
<div>To seek the Virgin Nymph or married Dame.<br>
</div> (p. 4)</blockquote>It was also wittily said, concerning his reputation for carnality, that &#145;he gained more hearts than souls&#146;  (Noble, 3.69). The archbishop also featured in a satirical poem of 1737 entitled <span class="italic">First Oars to L&#151;m&#151;th</span>, which portrayed Blackburne competing against his fellow bishops Edmund Gibson and Benjamin Hoadly for the archbishopric of Canterbury.<br>
<br>It was contended that Blackburne was favoured by the first two Georges because of the laxity of his moral precepts. One rumour suggested that Blackburne was rewarded with the archbishopric of York for secretly marrying George I to his mistress the duchess of Kendal. Horace Walpole alleged that Blackburne, talking with Queen Caroline in the presence of Sir Robert Walpole, had remarked, &#145;Madam, I am glad you like the king's new mistress, Lady Yarmouth; it shews you are a sensible woman, your Majesty having no objection for your husband to divert himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Sir Charles Hanbury Williams</span>, 2.135). The controversial archbishop has even been charged with the evidently groundless allegations that he was the father of Francis Blackburne, the heterodox author of the <span class="italic">Confessional</span>, and that Dick Turpin was his butler at Bishopthorpe. It is at this distance of time impossible to make definitive judgements about the veracity of the numerous allegations levelled against Blackburne. They must therefore be thought to illustrate the reputation rather than the reality of the man.<br>
<br>Blackburne was the author of several published sermons: one given before Queen Mary, entitled <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Anger</span> (1694); two before Queen Anne, <span class="italic">The Mystery of Godliness</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">The Blessedness of Suffering Persecution for Righteousness Sake</span> (1709); two before the mayor and aldermen of the City of London (1697, 1715); a Latin sermon before convocation (1714); and a sermon before the House of Commons on the anniversary of the martyrdom of Charles I (1716), in which he took the opportunity to liken the Jacobites to the regicides. He also published a pastoral letter addressed to the bishops of the province of York, which is annexed to a sermon of Lewis Stephens published in 1727. His wife, Catherine, died in 1726 and was buried on 11 June in the middle chancel of St Margaret's Church, Westminster. Blackburne himself died on 23 March 1743 at a time of severe weather. As Horace Walpole records it, &#145;his ancient Grace of York&#146; died of one of the &#145;epidemical distempers&#146; which accompanied ten days of &#145;snows, north-east winds, and blue plagues&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 1.235). He was buried on 1 April 1743 in St Margaret's, Westminster, near his wife.<br>
