<span class="headword">Osgoode,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1824), <span class="occ">judge in Canada</span>, was born in March 1754 in London, the only son of William Osgood (<i>d</i>. 1767), a Leeds hosier who left an estate of &pound;20,000. Perhaps because of his father's acquaintance with John Wesley, William was sent to the Methodist school at Kingswood, near Bath, from which he went to Christ Church, Oxford (BA, 1772; MA, 1777). He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1773 and was called to the bar in November 1779, the year in which he published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Law of Descent</span>, a response to William Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span>. Instead of practising as a barrister, Osgoode built a reputation as an accomplished draftsman in the courts of equity. In 1791, when Quebec was divided into two provinces, he secured appointment as chief justice of Upper Canada, with the promise of the same position in the senior colony of Lower Canada on the first vacancy. As an industrious administrator with tory and now Anglican sympathies, Osgoode enjoyed cordial relations with a like-minded lieutenant-governor, John Graves Simcoe, and leading British officials. Both an executive councillor and, as speaker of the legislative council, a manager of government business, Osgoode sought to adapt English civil law to the circumstances of an infant frontier colony. A controversial <span class="roman">Judicature Act</span> of 1794 scaled down the district courts of common pleas and created a central court of king's bench. He left largely unaltered English criminal law as introduced by the proclamation of 1763.<br>
<br>In 1794 Osgoode migrated to Quebec, where his career was less harmonious. He exchanged a loyalist province for an uncongenial French Catholic community at a time when Britain was at war with revolutionary France. Potential or imagined threats to the fragile social order and the colony's security, whether from invasion or subversion, alarmed Osgoode and a beleaguered English-speaking minority. In this fevered atmosphere the authorities enacted security legislation, enforced by an intelligence service and the active prosecution of rioters. Habeas corpus was suspended, and an elastic definition of sedition and treason, going far beyond British precedent, covered conspiracies hatched in an overseas territory and aimed at overturning the sovereignty of an absent king. In a show trial in 1797 an American undercover agent for revolutionary France, David McLane, was convicted and executed for high treason, a verdict guaranteed through proceedings manipulated by Osgoode and his fellow judges. In Lower Canada the judiciary was politicized, Osgoode himself combining the roles of chief justice, councillor, principal adviser to the governor, and head of political security.<br>
<br>The garrison mentality evinced by the ruling &eacute;lite also strained French&#150;British relations. Osgoode denounced the French Canadiens as ignorant, disloyal democrats. He found incomprehensible the earlier official endorsement of cultural toleration and argued that the security of British rule necessitated a vigorous policy of Anglicization. This stance exacerbated his fractious dealings with the experienced, masterful governor, Lord Dorchester, who had since the 1770s worked for ethnic accommodation. After a harmonious interlude in 1796&#150;7, Osgoode also fell foul of Dorchester's successor, the irascible General Robert Prescott, by engineering opposition among councillors to the governor's regulations for accelerating settlement of the Eastern townships, adjacent to the American border, and curtailing land speculation. The governor accused his chief justice of being in league with speculators, a plausible charge since Osgoode acquired almost 12,000 acres. In 1799 Prescott was recalled following protests to London orchestrated by Osgoode. His bickering with Robert Shore Milnes, who arrived that year as lieutenant-governor, prompted him to resign in return for an &pound;800 pension, and he left Quebec in 1801. In London, still concerned about Canadian affairs, Osgoode advised the Colonial Office in 1822 on the drafting of an abortive bill to reunite the Canadas. With an abiding interest in procedural reform, he served on two royal commissions on the courts of law which eventually led in 1832 to the <span class="roman">Uniformity of Process Act</span>. He died, unmarried, at the Albany, London, on 17 January 1824. Osgoode Hall, first built in York (Toronto) in 1829&#150;32 as headquarters of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and now a law school associated with York University, was named after him.<br>
