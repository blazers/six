<span class="headword">Slazenger,  Ralph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ralph  Slazenger Moss]</span>  (1845&#150;1910), <span class="occ">manufacturer of sporting goods</span>, was born Ralph Slazenger Moss at Lymm, Cheshire, the oldest of the twelve children of Joseph Slazenger Moss (1810&#150;1872), a tailor with shops in Warrington and Lancashire, and his wife, Eliza Lazarus. Both were prominent members of the Jewish community in the Manchester area.<br>
<br>Moss was educated at Manchester grammar school until 1859, when he entered his father's business as an apprentice. By the time of his father's death in 1872 the business had expanded considerably, with four shops of general outfitters. Together with his brothers Isaac (1857&#150;1940) and Albert (<i>b</i>. 1856), he fostered further expansion, importing goods from abroad and establishing factories in both Manchester and Paris. During this period he claimed to have spent thirty years as a volunteer in the Lancashire light horse, as a keen proponent of national defence.<br>
<br>With an eye on wider markets, Moss left the northern business in the hands of his brothers and moved to London in 1885, starting a new business at 56 Cannon Street, manufacturing indiarubber goods for the growing enthusiasm for middle-class sports. This was more than just a commercial move to exploit new markets; it represented a significant break with his regional and religious roots as he renounced Judaism and shortened his surname officially to Slazenger. One great boost to his personal life, and his business, came with his marriage in 1890 to a wealthy widow, Jane Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1912?), of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. There were no children but the marriage had other fruits.<br>
<br>Slazenger's business grew rapidly from this time onwards, not least because he became a leading manufacturer of balls and other equipment for the booming late-Victorian middle-class games of golf and lawn tennis. The latter was the focus of a sharp commercial struggle for the publicity which came from providing balls for the All England Lawn Tennis Club's annual Wimbledon tournaments and its ancillary events, such as the tournament at Eastbourne. Slazenger's involvement in this was in large part due to the acumen and rather sharp practices of his manager, Archdale Palmer, who dragged the firm into a scandal amid allegations of attempted bribery at Wimbledon in 1905. This did not, however, harm the firm's reputation or growth and Palmer continued to work for Slazengers. Having moved largely from manual to machine production, Slazenger floated his business on the stock exchange in 1910, increasing profits by fifty per cent, to almost &pound;50,000 per annum, by 1913. Other brothers became involved in the firm, Horatio (1859&#150;1946) as a director and Frank (<i>b</i>. 1860) as the manager of their New York agency.<br>
<br>As his prosperity grew Ralph Slazenger became heavily involved in the corporate life of the City of London, becoming a member of the Spectacle-makers', Shipwrights', Gardeners', Fruiterers', Loriners', and Makers of Playing Cards' livery companies, as well as master of the Needlemakers'. This brought social recognition, the freedom of the City of London, and election to the common council of the City for Dowgate ward in May 1903. In 1909 he was appointed sheriff of London but he was defeated in an election for alderman. Because of his public role in entertaining foreign dignitaries he was honoured by the king of Portugal and by the king of the Belgians, who made him an officer of the order of the Crown in August 1910. His public life extended to visible philanthropy, as a governor of Christ's Hospital and of the Royal School for Deaf Children at Margate; he was also a keen supporter of the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, where he endowed a children's bed in his own name, a common seeking after immortality for people of similar status. Like many of the affluent middle classes whose leisure he serviced, he was an avid sportsman, a cricketer, golfer, and shot; he also became a member of the Royal Automobile Club.<br>
<br>Slazenger died at his Kensington home, 9 Kensington Court, on 24 October 1910 from bronchitis and influenza; his wish for a non-religious cremation was ignored by his wife who arranged an Anglican service. He was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium on 27 October. At the time of his death the firm that he had founded was one of the most significant sporting goods businesses in Britain.<br>
