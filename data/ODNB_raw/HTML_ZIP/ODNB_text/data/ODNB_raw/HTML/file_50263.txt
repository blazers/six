<span class="headword">Wyche,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1440), <span class="occ">Lollard heretic</span>, was probably from the diocese of Hereford. He was presumably educated at Oxford, and at his first trial, before Bishop Skirlawe of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1406), affirmed that he had been taught by men trained in law, although he also argued cogently on theological issues, including the eucharist. Nothing is known of his background before the trial, which probably took place in the winter of 1402&#150;3. The ecclesiastical authorities clearly sought his submission rather than his condemnation, and tried to convince him by argument. Even after being sentenced to prison and degradation (a sentence which was evidently not carried out), he wrote an account of the trial to his friends. After a later recantation, between 1404 and 1406, Wyche temporarily disappears from sight. Later, in 1419, he stated that he had been brought south by a writ of <i>corpus cum causa</i> and released in chancery. After his release he either developed or resumed contacts with Bohemia and with Jan Hus, to whom he wrote on 8 September 1410, describing him as his &#145;dearest brother in Christ&#146;. He must have sent books to Bohemia, because Hus, in his reply of the following March, thanked Wyche for these. This may not have been the only letter, because Hus alluded to Wyche's troubles (not described in the surviving letter) in his reply. Before then Wyche had also become associated with Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417), who wrote on the same day to Woksa of Waldstein, one of Hus's Bohemian supporters.<br>
<br>Wyche, however, avoided involvement in Oldcastle's rebellion of 1414, although he was arrested in 1417 and brought to Westminster to make disclosures about money that had belonged to Oldcastle. He was brought before the Canterbury convocation in 1419, but as he was not found guilty of relapse, heresy cannot have been proved against him. After imprisonment in the Fleet, he was released under sureties in the following year, under the description of Richard Wyche alias Godwote. The authorities evidently believed that he had abandoned his heresy, for he was appointed vicar of Deptford in 1423, and rector of Leaveland in Kent in 1434. In 1437 he was appointed vicar of Harmondsworth, Middlesex, and he was still there in 1439. Shortly after, however, he was again arrested and tried by Bishop Gilbert of London. He was found guilty of heresy, degraded at St Paul's, and burnt on 17 June 1440 at Tower Hill with his servant Roger Norman. Only one chronicle mentions any of his beliefs, hostility to clerical pluralism&#151;he declared that a layman was as entitled to have two wives as a priest two benefices.<br>
<br>The burning is widely recorded in the London city chronicles, which relate that Wyche was highly regarded among the common people, some of whom held that he was a saint. Chronicle and record sources (from both chancery and civic documents) relate that his followers made pilgrimages to the place of his death, and, however inappropriate it might be for Lollards to do so, some at any rate may have tried to gather together his ashes as relics. Claims were also made that miracles had taken place at the site of his death, where his followers made offerings and set up a wooden cross in his memory. In order to counter these assertions the mayor sent a number of aldermen to the place of execution to hold back the crowd, and later the civic authorities deliberately polluted the ground and turned it into a dunghill.<br>
<br>Wyche was probably respected by the London Lollards because he was a link with the early years of the movement; he was the last surviving academic heretic of the immediate post-Wyclif generation, and had had links with Oldcastle. The popular response to his death suggests that the Lollards still enjoyed a considerable measure of support in London.<br>
