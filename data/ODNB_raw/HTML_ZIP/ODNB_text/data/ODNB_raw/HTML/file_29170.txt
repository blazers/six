<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton,  Philip</span>, fourth Baron Wharton  (1613&#150;1696), <span class="occ">politician</span>, son of Sir Thomas Wharton (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1622) of Easby, Yorkshire, and his wife, Philadelphia (<i>d</i>. 1654/5), daughter of Robert Carey, first earl of Monmouth, was born on 8 April 1613.<h2>
<a name="Educationandmarriage"></a>Education and marriage</h2>In 1624 Wharton went to Eton College for a year. His father having died in 1622, on 25 March 1625 Philip succeeded to the barony of his grandfather, also Philip. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 3 March 1626. In 1629 he and his brother, Sir Thomas, had licence to travel abroad for three years, and Wharton is said to have served for a time as a volunteer in the army of the prince of Orange. Reputedly he combined militancy in the cause of international protestantism with a love of dancing and a connoisseur's taste in art. His collection of works by Anthony Van Dyck, for whom he sat himself, had found its way to the Hermitage in St Petersburg by 1914. On 23 September 1632 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Rowland Wandesford of Pickhill, Yorkshire. On coming of age in 1634 he inherited an estate estimated to have brought him an annual income of &pound;8000. His wife, Elizabeth, having died, on 7 September 1637 he married Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1618, <i>d</i>. 1658), daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10987/', "Arthur Goodwin")</script> of Winchendon and Wooburn, Buckinghamshire, MP for Buckinghamshire in the Long Parliament. They had six sons of whom three survived and four daughters. In 1638 Wharton was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on the interest of William Lenthall, future speaker of the same assembly.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarysupporter"></a>Parliamentary supporter</h2>During the first bishops' war of 1639 Wharton compounded for his attendance on the king at York, paying &pound;500 rather than repair, as ordered, to his northern estates and wait there in arms. He sat in the Short Parliament of May 1640 and voted against the precedence of supply over redress of grievances. The following summer he helped to organize the Yorkshire petitions protesting against the military burdens placed on the county by the preparations to fight the Scots, and other grievances. The king personally rebuked him and Burnet claimed that the earl of Strafford went so far as to threaten to have Wharton shot at the head of the army as a seditious incendiary. It has been plausibly suggested that there was an intimate connection between the Yorkshire petitions and the efforts of those opposition peers colluding at this time with the Scottish covenanters in order to pressurize the king into summoning a new parliament. Wharton was entirely in sympathy with the petition of the twelve peers calling on the king to do just that, presented to Charles at York on 2 September 1640, although his name does not appear on the original, only on subsequent versions. Wharton was one of the peers chosen to negotiate with the Scots at Ripon in September and again at London in November 1640. Robert Baillie remarked on his friendly disposition towards the Scots, and the king evidently distrusted him, including him in the list of witnesses he intended to call in prosecution of the six members in January 1642. Sympathy for the covenanters' cause reflected Wharton's own religious outlook, which was strongly anti-Laudian. In September 1641 he protested when by a slender majority the House of Lords voted to uphold the form of public worship then established in law, rather than countenance the House of Commons' forthright condemnation of religious innovations.<br>
<br>Wharton was immediately to the fore on the parliamentary side at the outbreak of the civil war. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Lancashire by the Long Parliament on 28 February, and of Buckinghamshire on 24 June 1642. That summer he was also appointed to command an army, which in the event never materialized, intended to quell the Catholic rebellion in Ireland. On 30 July Wharton accepted a commission instead to command a regiment of foot in the army of the earl of Essex, to which he recruited men from the Wharton fief of Kirkby Stephen in Westmorland. The honour of his service in the field at Edgehill was disputed. For his part, Lord General Essex did not scruple to dispatch Wharton to Westminster to give parliament an account of the engagement. In a speech given at the Guildhall almost immediately afterwards Wharton did nothing to deny the ignominy of his regiment's flight without a fight, but neither did he say anything which could possibly be construed as confirming the rumour, apparently only current many years later, that he himself had run away and hid in a saw-pit. Wharton did not, however, venture forth in arms again. He was one of the most active parliamentarian peers during the civil wars, serving as speaker of the upper house on numerous occasions, and was appointed to many of the most important executive committees.<br>
<br>Their estates in the north of England having been overrun by the earl of Newcastle's royalist army, Wharton and Lord Howard of Escrick had held preliminary talks with the Scots in spring 1643 which eventually produced the alliance with the covenanters. Wharton was a founding member of the committee of both kingdoms, and also an energetic lay member of the Westminster assembly. But his faith in the Scottish alliance was almost entirely a matter of military convenience. Although he promoted the assembly's directory in the north, at least as a preferable alternative to prayer book worship, Wharton was probably closer to the religious Independents. Certainly his support for the assembly evaporated once he and his war party associates revolted from their pro-Scottish allegiance, and he eventually advocated its dissolution. By the close of 1644, increasingly concerned by the new threat which the Scottish army posed to his northern estates, Wharton was aligning himself with the political Independent cause of English self-sufficiency in arms and the repudiation of Scottish influence over English affairs. Eager to oust the earl of Essex from his command of the parliamentarian forces, Wharton was one of the keenest supporters in the House of Lords of the self-denying ordinance and the foundation of the New Model Army.<br>
<br>Once the new military arrangements were successfully established in the field Wharton energetically sought ways of terminating the Scottish alliance. His patronage secured the election of Henry Ireton, commissary general of the new army, for the borough of Appleby in Westmorland. Uncharacteristically, and perhaps deceptively, he appears to have played no part in the clash between parliament and army in 1647. His behaviour the following year is equally difficult to interpret. He was identified as one of a cabinet junto of grandees at Derby House undermining the terms of the vote of no addresses by seeking to negotiate a settlement with Charles I in private. Yet in June 1648 he was also accused of concealing a plot to assassinate the king on the Isle of Wight, of which imputation he was cleared by the House of Lords. The following month it was rumoured that he, Lord Saye and Sele, and Oliver Cromwell had met to consider using the army to crush support for a personal treaty with the king in the City. However, in a show of journalistic humility rare for the age, the story was subsequently retracted, and on balance it seems entirely likely that Wharton supported the negotiations with the king conducted in the autumn at Newport on the Isle of Wight. He later claimed to have protested publicly at the purge of the Commons. Certainly he did not sit in the Lords after 7 December 1648, and ignored a summons to attend, so was not present in the upper house on 2 January 1649 when the peers rejected the Commons' ordinance for the trial of the king. Almost certainly he did not agree with the proceedings which ensued and he certainly did not accept their outcome, despite the frequent urgings of his intimate acquaintance, Oliver Cromwell, who implored him that he accept the harsh dealing with the king, and wrote &#145;be not offended at the manner &hellip; perhaps no other way was left&#146;  (Firth, 231&#150;2). Vainly Cromwell summoned to mind Wharton's years of personal sacrifice during the civil wars: &#145;You were with us in the form of things: why not in the power?&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Although Wharton kept aloof from the regimes which governed England in the years that followed, Cromwell evidently flattered himself to think they remained on sufficiently good terms that a match could be pursued in 1652 between his son Henry and one of Wharton's daughters. It was not just the reluctance of the lady in question which prevented the union, but also the misgivings of her father, which Cromwell frankly acknowledged &#145;may make the business uneasy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 2.561). In December 1653 Wharton was given to understand that Cromwell had it in mind to have him sit on his council, but evidently nothing came of it. In 1654 Wharton attempted to use what personal influence he still had with Cromwell on behalf of his kinsman Lord Claneboye, an Ulster protestant whose claim to the benefit of articles granted at the surrender of Ormond in April 1650 had been slighted by the commissioners for the government of Ireland. An ordinance indemnifying Claneboye's estate was drawn up, but at the last seems to have come unstuck. Wharton was one of several peers summoned to sit in Cromwell's House of Lords in 1657. Although he &#145;thought of accepting&#146;  (Firth, 250), a robust letter from Lord Saye and Sele, who swore never to divest the nobility of England of their birthright by falling into the tyrant's embrace, emboldened Wharton to refuse.<h2>
<a name="Restorationpoliticsanddisillusionment"></a>Restoration politics and disillusionment</h2>In spring 1660 Wharton's home was said to have been one of the venues for meetings of the presbyterian junto at Westminster which wanted Charles II seated on his throne conditionally on his acceptance of the terms agreed with his father at the treaty of Newport in 1648, although it was also claimed that Wharton himself favoured unconditional restoration. He was probably one of those former parliamentarians growing increasingly alarmed in the later 1650s at the rise of the most astounding religious heterodoxy. His appointee to the parish of Kirkby Stephen, Francis Higginson, was in the front line of the confrontation with spiritual enthusiasm when it arose in the region in the early 1650s in the persons of George Fox, James Naylor, and others whom Higginson referred to as &#145;Satan's Seeds-men&#146;  (Breay, 167). After taking their seats in the Convention in April 1660 Wharton and his fellow presbyterian peers were instrumental in bringing about the Stuart Restoration, although many of them saw in it little more than a defence against the imminent immolation, as they imagined, of civil society.<br>
<br>Wharton ostentatiously welcomed Charles II on his return to England, although he did so dressed in black for a wife who had died two years earlier. There was some danger of his exemption from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> in connection with the allegations surrounding the supposed assassination plot of 1648, but it was supposedly averted by the intercession of his son-in-law, Lord Willoughby of Eresby, future earl of Lindsey, and Wharton suffered relatively slightly in his estate, losing lands in Ireland. The duke of York himself was also said to have deflected criticism of Wharton, an indication of the Stuarts' willingness to court their old enemies in order to balance the ardour of their most loyal friends. In 1660 it had seemed likely that Wharton might be persuaded to accept a modified episcopacy, and he chaired the committee of the convention which produced the broadly conciliatory act for confirming and restoring ministers. But the creeping Anglicanism of the Restoration church settlement meant that he found his religious allegiances cast him further and further out into nonconformity. He was to the fore in the organization of the &#145;presbyterian&#146; caucus in the Cavalier parliament which worked to curb the potentially devastating impact of the church settlement on law-abiding protestants who scrupled to conform, opposing for example, the episcopal reordination of ministers who owed their position to presbyterian examination. On 24 or 26 August 1661 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1692), widow of Edward Popham and daughter of William Carr. They had one son.<br>
<br>Initially, far from being an opponent of the new regime, Wharton probably ought to be seen as acting in the capacity of a manager of the court interest, but the failure to secure any real comprehension for nonconformist protestants seems to have sapped his loyalty, and he began instead to attack the court. He was suspected of involvement in the 1663 armed uprising of political and religious radicals in Yorkshire and Westmorland, and in July supported the earl of Bristol's attempted impeachment of Clarendon (although he remained neutral four years later in the debate on whether to commit the impeached lord chancellor to the Tower). In 1663&#150;5 Wharton attacked the <span class="roman">Conventicle and Five Mile Acts</span>, renewing his opposition to the former at the debates on its renewal in 1670. From the mid-1670s Wharton was one of the acknowledged leaders of the country party in the House of Lords. He was prominent in his opposition to Danby's <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in 1675, and was arrested the same year while worshipping in the congregation of the dissenting minister Dr Thomas Manton. He was sent to the Tower in 1677 for arguing that the Cavalier Parliament was dissolved by the fifteen-month prorogation. He took little part in the politics of the Popish Plot and subsequent exclusion crisis, his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29175/', "Thomas Wharton, later first marquess of Wharton")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38118/', "Goodwin Wharton")</script> taking more of a lead in the harrying of Catholics in general and the duke of York in particular.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionandfinalyears"></a>Revolution and final years</h2>Wharton left the country on the accession of James II, and was an enthusiastic advocate of the revolution of 1688. In the council of peers held after the king's flight, when Clarendon urged consideration of the rights of the prince of Wales, Wharton answered &#145;I did not expect at this time of day to hear anybody mention that child &hellip; and I hope we shall hear no more of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Wharton became a privy councillor to William and Mary in February 1689. His last action on the political stage was, however, to oppose the 1690 bill for an oath abjuring James II. He died on 4 or 5 February 1696 at Hampstead and was buried at Wooburn on the 12th. He was succeeded by his son Thomas.<br>
