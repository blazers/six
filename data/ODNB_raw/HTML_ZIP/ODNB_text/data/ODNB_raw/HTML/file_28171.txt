<span class="headword">Veel,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1591&#150;1663/4), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and conspirator</span>, was born at Alveston, Gloucestershire, the third or fourth son of Nicholas Veel and his wife, the daughter of Robert Bridges of Combe, Gloucestershire. He was also the scion of an ancient family of minor gentry, who leased another Gloucestershire estate at Symondshall in Wotton under Edge from the Berkeleys of Berkeley Castle, with whom they had strong historic ties. Veel married first Dorothy Wynneate, with whom he had a son, William (<i>d</i>. 1656), father of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28170/', "Robert Veel")</script>, and three daughters. He also had two more sons, Nicholas and Thomas, with a second wife whose name is unknown.<br>
<br>According to one source, Veel saw military service overseas, though he may only have been a trained bands colonel  (Newman). He was one of the earliest and most active royalists in the county from the outset of the civil war, defying the efforts of John Smyth to hold the Berkeley interest neutral. He was named to the royalist commission of the peace in March 1643, then appointed governor of Berkeley Castle in November 1643 after the resignation of Captain Maxwell. According to John Corbet the troops under his command were formidable only in plunder, hemmed in as they were by parliamentarian garrisons at nearby Slimbridge and Frampton. Veel was dismissed as governor in August 1644, apparently because the earl of Bristol wished to place Colonel Richard Power there, but he remained in arms at least until June 1645. He later compounded for his estates, paying &pound;704 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., after enduring plundering, sequestration, and other charges which, on top of heavy debts, quite ruined the estate. A descendant's claims that Veel was related to the presbyterian royalist (and former parliamentarian governor of Gloucester) Sir Edward Massey, that he raised a horse regiment which fought alongside Massey at Worcester on 3 September 1651, and that he escaped to the continent afterwards are unproven and implausible. However, Massey certainly trusted the Veel family implicitly, writing later that they were &#145;all zealously his Ma[jes]ties servants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 4.158&#150;9).<br>
<br>After Penruddock's abortive rising of February 1656 and the rise of the &#145;action party&#146; among royalist plotters, Veel became a pivotal figure in local plans for an uprising against the interregnum regimes. These plans varied over the years but generally revolved around his raising up to 3000 men to take Gloucester and Bristol in preparation for a landing. Charles II sent him blank recruiting commissions in November 1656 and again in May 1659. Massey spent several months in hiding at the Veel family house in Symondshall in mid-1659 while organizing a revolt. On 31 July, shortly before this was due to start, troops from the Gloucester garrison arrested Veel, his two surviving sons, and his grandson (another Thomas), then Massey himself. The estates were briefly re-sequestered. Both Thomas the grandson and Nicholas were imprisoned, and Nicholas was imprisoned again in Hurst Castle in September. The former, who had fled when the estates were ordered to be sequestered, returned to assault the commissioners' agent in November and taunt him that Monck was coming from Scotland to restore the king.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, mindful of Veel's huge sacrifices, Charles and Clarendon discussed several ways of rewarding him. These included the profits from the sale of a baronetcy, the rights to certain bonds from merchants bound over for defrauding the customs, the rights to smuggled French goods, a share of receipts from the West Indies from the commissioners of prizes, and the lease of the ballast office. However, as Clarendon admitted, Veel repeatedly lost out to less deserving petitioners. In 1661 his son Nicholas and grandson Thomas were granted the office of making and registering assurances in London, which they held in trust for Veel to pay him profits which were worth over &pound;400 per year. They later became county collectors of the royal and additional aids and the hearth tax and embarked on chequered careers in the royal service, facing constant resistance from JPs and the populace until they lost their positions, poorer by thousands of pounds, in 1668. By then Colonel Thomas Veel was dead, having died at some point between 7 October 1663, when he made the final codicil to his will, and 26 May 1664, when the will was proved; he was buried in Alveston church.<br>
