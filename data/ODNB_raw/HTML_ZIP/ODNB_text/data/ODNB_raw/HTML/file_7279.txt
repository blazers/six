<span class="headword">Davis,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1682&#150;1693), <span class="occ">buccaneer</span>, about whom no details concerning his birth and education are known, was embarked in the late autumn of 1682 in a French privateer operating in the Caribbean under the command of Captain Yanky. Davis transferred into Captain Tristian's ship, Yanky's consort, before being embroiled in a mutiny at Petit Guaves, near Port-au-Prince. Davis sailed under a new captain, John Cook, arriving in Chesapeake Bay in April 1683 where William Dampier and other veteran buccaneers resident in Virginia were recruited for a voyage to the South Sea. On 23 August Cook sailed with Davis as quartermaster. Off the coast of Guinea they seized a Danish prize, 36 guns, which they renamed the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i>, before sailing in her to South America in late November.<br>
<br>In March 1684 the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> joined the <i>Nicholas</i> (Captain John Eaton) off Valdivia. Together they sailed to the Juan Fernandez Islands to be greeted by a Moskito Indian who had been stranded accidentally by Captain Bartholomew Sharpe in January 1681. Dampier's description of this man's meeting another Moskito Indian, whom they had on board, probably inspired Daniel Defoe's account of Friday's reunion with his father in <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1719). On 3 May 1684 the buccaneers overhauled a Spanish ship whose crew informed Cook that the authorities were aware of his presence in the South Sea. Cook and Eaton decided to head for the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. Theirs were the first English vessels to visit the archipelago. After Cook's sudden death Davis was elected commander on 19 July 1684. Davis quarrelled with Eaton and on 2 September they parted, Davis sailing for Port St Helena. On 2 October the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> joined the <i>Cygnet</i> (Captain Swan), both crews combining to mount raids ashore. On 1 January 1685 Davis seized a packet-boat bound for Lima with orders concerning the departure of the plate fleet for Panama. On 7 January Davis and Swan sailed for the Pearl Islands to intercept the consignment. By 15 February the treasure had still not arrived. The Spanish fleet was finally sighted on 28 May but it had already detoured to land its cargo at La Villa, and had redeployed to engage a growing number of buccaneer vessels in the Bay of Panama. Battle was joined on 29 May and, despite being outnumbered by three to one, the buccaneers avoided defeat in an indecisive action. Shortly afterwards the buccaneers' alliance fell apart. Davis and Swan combined their forces with those of two other vessels for an attack on L&eacute;on after which, on 25 August 1685, they separated. Swan, with Dampier on board, sailed westwards across the Pacific to the East Indies.<br>
<br>Davis spent the remainder of the year cruising, attacking ports in Peru and Chile with Captain William Knight. The pickings were poor, and food was as much sought after as gold. When Knight departed for the West Indies Davis decided to spend Christmas at Juan Fernandez. While approaching the islands the crew felt the shock of the earthquake which destroyed Callao and damaged Lima. Lionel Wafer records they were 450 miles off the mainland when, about four in the morning<blockquote>our Ship and Bark felt a terrible Shock [which] made the Guns of the Ship leap in their Carriages, and several of the Men were shaken out of their Hammocks. Captain <i>Davis</i>, who lay with his Head over a Gun, was thrown out of his Cabbin.</blockquote>They learned later that the &#145;rowling Mountains of Water &hellip; drowned Man and Beast for 50 Leagues along Shore&#146;  (Wafer, 213).<br>
<br>Davis resumed cruising in the new year, but by the autumn he had decided to return home. He attempted the Horn late in the season and suffered appalling weather as a result. Sailing south for three weeks, Davis never sighted Tierra del Fuego and never knew when, after turning north, he entered the Atlantic. He made his landfall near the hill of Montevideo just north of the River Plate, almost the same latitude from which he had embarked on the west side of the continent. To Davis's credit there appears to have been no mutiny, sickness, or death among the crew. From Montevideo the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> headed for the Caribbean, and into obscurity. Davis, Wafer, and John Hingson transferred into a vessel bound for Pennsylvania. On 22 June 1688, after a brief spell in Philadelphia, all three were arrested on suspicion of piracy as they attempted to cross from Port Comfort to the Elizabeth River in a small boat. The inventory of Davis's effects included three bags of Spanish money, and a small chest containing silver weighing 142 pounds.<br>
<br>At a board of inquiry on 26 June Davis claimed to have been a trader, resident in Jamaica for about seven years. He denied ever having been a privateer but his black servant, Peter Cloise, gave contradictory evidence. On 16 August 1688 Davis petitioned for immunity from prosecution under a proclamation by James II concerning privateers, issued the previous year; and in October Lord Sutherland of the council of trade and plantations sent instructions that Davis and his men were to be prosecuted, but these orders seem to have been ignored.<br>
<br>In April 1689 the council of Virginia ordered the buccaneers to be returned to England. They arrived home in November, without their possessions. In March 1692 it was agreed that Davis's property should be restored to him but a royal order withheld &pound;300, plus a quarter of the amount still in Jamestown. The moneys forfeited may have been applied to the building of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. In November 1693 the council of Virginia invited creditors of the three men to come forward, perhaps indicating that full restitution had still not taken place at that date. Nothing further is known about Davis. There is no evidence to link him with Nathaniel Davis, author of a narrative entitled &#145;Expedition to the gold mines&#146; which appeared in the second edition of Wafer's <span class="italic">A New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America</span> (1704). Edward Davis signed his depositions in Virginia with a mark, indicating that he may have been illiterate anyway.<br>
<br>Davis's modern fame chiefly rests on his dubious &#145;discovery&#146; of a Pacific land mass in December 1687. According to Wafer, the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> was in latitude 27&deg;20' S, some 500 leagues south of the Gal&aacute;pagos archipelago, when a small flat island was encountered to the east of &#145;a range of high Land, which we took to be Islands, for there were several Partitions in the Prospect&#146;  (Wafer, 214). Herman Moll showed &#145;Davis's Land&#146; in this position on his world map which formed the frontispiece to Dampier's <span class="italic">A New Voyage Round the World</span> (1697). In 1721 the Dutch West India Company fitted out three ships under Jacob Roggeveen to search for &#145;Davis Land&#146;, and half a century later French and British discovery ships were still looking for it. The true identity of &#145;Davis Land&#146; remains a puzzle. It may have been Easter Island, but it is equally possible that Davis and his men were deceived by a bank of cloud.<br>
