<span class="headword">Whittaker,  James William</span>  (1828&#150;1876), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Manchester on 24 August 1828, the elder of the two sons of John (sometimes referred to as James) Whittaker, a warehouseman, and his wife, Mary. Both sons were baptized at the collegiate church, Manchester, on 10 April 1831. As a young man James was apprenticed as an engraver to Joseph Heyes, a calico printer in Manchester; this work led him to etching and subsequently to watercolour painting. On 3 June 1846 at the collegiate church he married Sarah Heyes (Hayes) (<i>b</i>. 1825), the daughter of Thomas Heyes, a Post Office clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth. The couple had four children, including Charles Henry (<i>b</i>. 1855) and Frank Hammet (<i>b</i>. 1864); by the late 1840s Whittaker, described as an engraver, was living in Salford. By 1858 he had sufficient money to enable him to move to Wales to work full-time as an artist: for &pound;10 a year he rented Frith Cottage on the road between Betws-y-coed and Llanrwst, Denbighshire, from where he drew pictures of Welsh scenery. Initially he sold his pictures to a Manchester dealer for a price between merely &pound;2 and &pound;4, but a meeting in Wales with the artist Francis William Topham encouraged him to stand for election to the Society of Painters in Water Colours. He was elected to the Old Watercolour Society as an associate in 1862 and a full member two years later.<br>
<br>Although he is recorded as having exhibited both continental landscapes and Northumberland coastal scenes, Whittaker is best-known for his meticulous and atmospheric evocations of Welsh scenery, such as <span class="italic">Mountain Scene in North Wales, with Stream and Cattle</span> and <span class="italic">Road between Capel Curig and Llyn Ogwen</span> (both Victoria and Albert Museum, London). In all, 177 of his drawings were exhibited by the Old Watercolour Society at its gallery in Pall Mall, London, and another 14 sketches in its winter exhibition of 1876&#150;7, after his death. He was able to command good prices for his work, the highest recorded being &pound;262 10<i>s</i>. for <span class="italic">Flood on the River Conway</span> at the show of 1864. He also exhibited three pictures at the Royal Academy. His usual signature was J. W. Whittaker.<br>
<br>Photographs of Whittaker portray him as a tall, rather heavily built man with a round face and full beard, evidently well-dressed and prosperous. Success had enabled him to rebuild his cottage as a substantial house which he called Frith Castle, but towards the end of his life he was drinking heavily and the quality of his work deteriorated. He died on 6 September 1876 after falling into the River Llugwy, above Betws-y-coed. His body was washed downstream where he was found drowned with, according to the coroner's inquest, a couple of empty spirit bottles on his person. His wife had predeceased him and he left four children. The agent to the surrounding Foelas estate commented, &#145;there is not much of any value as he has sold everything he could convert into money&#146;  (Lord, 76&#150;7).<br>
