</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phipson,  (Mary) Edith  Pechey-</span>  (1845&#150;1908), <span class="occ">physician and women's rights activist</span>, was born Mary Edith Pechey on 7 October 1845 in the village of Langham, near Colchester, Essex, the sixth child and third daughter of the Revd William Pechey (<i>d</i>. 1888), Baptist minister at Langham Chapel, and his wife, Sarah Rotton (<i>d</i>. 1879). Both parents came from upper middle-class families: her mother descended from an attorney's family and her father had an MA in theology from Edinburgh University. It appears that Edith was mainly tutored at home by her father and that she later worked as a schoolteacher and governess for a while in Langham before she left for Edinburgh.<br>
<br>At the age of twenty-four Edith Pechey began to take an active part in the struggle for women's right to study and practise medicine. In 1869 she responded to a request from Sophia Jex-Blake and became one of the six women who joined Jex-Blake in the fight for the right to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61136/', "Edinburgh Seven")</script>]. In October 1869 Edith won the right to sit the preliminary examination in arts which was a requirement for all medical students.<br>
<br>In 1870 Edith passed the matriculation exams with honours, which allowed her to proceed to register as a student of medicine. She received the highest marks in chemistry, which entitled her to the prestigious Hope scholarship, which carried a cash prize and free entry to laboratory facilities. The prize was withheld from her and awarded to a male student who had come second. Edith was instead offered a bronze medal. She appealed against this discrimination but the university senate upheld the decision of the faculty of medicine. The next two years continued to be a trying time for Edith and her colleagues. They met with antagonism and hostility from some male students and academics. In the autumn of 1870 they won the right to attend mixed classes (since separate classes for female students were considered as inadequate for qualification to take the professional exams). However, the very first mixed class they attended turned into a disturbance, known popularly as the Surgeons' Hall riot. Edith and her friends were verbally and sexually harassed by the students and some lecturers.<br>
<br>In December 1873 Edith wrote to the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland asking them whether they would admit women to the exams and grant them a licence in midwifery. Meanwhile Edith was able to gain employment as a house surgeon at the Birmingham and Midlands Hospital for Women. She held this post for a year from July 1875 to 1876. Her new employer knew that Edith was not in a position to obtain a diploma but she was nevertheless hired on the basis of her impeccable certificates and testimonials. While the college in Ireland was considering the issue of licensing women to practise medicine Edith, along with Sophia and Annie Clark, went to the University of Bern in order to undertake further medical study. Edith's biographer records that she passed her medical exams in German on 31 January 1877 and acquired the degree of MD. In the same month the Irish college became the first British examining body to issue licences to women to practise medicine. On 9 May 1877 Edith took the medical exams in Dublin and became a licentiate of King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland.<br>
<br>From 1877 to 1883, the year she left for India, Edith practised medicine in Leeds. She also became involved in women's education, lecturing to women's groups on subjects as diverse as nursing, hygiene and sanitation, and women's physical well-being. Edith helped to set up the Medical Women's Federation of England in response to the International Medical Congress's exclusion of women from its membership. She was elected president of the federation in 1882.<br>
<br>Pechey was one of the prominent British female doctors who took advantage of the opportunities created by empire. In 1883 Elizabeth Garrett-Anderson wrote to Edith asking her if she would be interested in going to Bombay to take charge of the projected Cama Hospital for Women and Children. Edith was offered the post of senior medical officer at a guaranteed salary of Rs 500 per month, with free living quarters and a first-class return fare. She was also allowed the privilege of private practice. The Medical Women for India fund was to pay her salary for the first three years with the government of India guaranteeing her employment thereafter.<br>
<br>Edith arrived in Bombay on 12 December 1883 and, according to her biographer, she learned to speak and write in Hindi within a year of her arrival. Edith was also put in charge of the Jaffer Sulleman Dispensary for Women. In 1892 the surgeon-general reported that the Cama Hospital served 1399 in-patients while 9885 out-patients were served at the Sulleman Dispensary.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1886 Edith accepted the government's offer to continue her employment on the condition that she was allowed to continue private practice and also to be granted a six months' vacation in England from 6 May to 19 November 1887. Her private clientele included minor princesses such as the rani of Udaipur and also members of the indigenous &eacute;lite of Bombay. In March 1889 Edith Pechey married Herbert Musgrave Phipson (1849&#150;1936), a wine merchant and the secretary of the Medical Women for India fund. After her marriage she adopted the surname of Pechey-Phipson.<br>
<br>During her time in India, Edith strove to improve the position and status for women in the medical profession, but faced reluctance from officials to grant equality of treatment between male and female medical officers. She also played a prominent part in the social reform movements of late nineteenth-century India and was well known for her active part in the campaign against the institution of child marriage. Edith participated in full measure in the social and intellectual life of Bombay. She was often asked to address public gatherings on the question of extending educational facilities and professional training for women. She was invited to sit on the visitors' committee for the prestigious Alexandra Native Girls' English Institution, Bombay, in 1890. In 1891 she was elected to the senate of the University of Bombay, the first woman member of this institution. In 1892 she became the vice-president of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, a distinguished honour since no woman had ever been elected on the board of this &eacute;lite organization. In the same year she was elected to the executive committee of the Bombay branch of the National Indian Association.<br>
<br>Pechey-Phipson resigned in 1894 from her post as first physician in the Cama Hospital due to ill health. Between 1894 and 1896 she continued her private practice which she found more manageable while struggling to cope with diabetes. What is perhaps less well known is her contribution to public health measures when bubonic plague struck Bombay in 1896. In February 1897 the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazette</span> published a letter from Pechey-Phipson criticizing the official management of the plague operations. The letter proved to be widely influential and was consequently reprinted, and quoted by officials who took note of her criticisms.<br>
<br>Early in 1905 Edith, together with her husband, sailed from Bombay for England, spending some time along the way in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Her thoughts had turned to women's participation in the world of public affairs and on her return she was asked to represent the Women's Suffrage Association of Leeds at the third conference of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance to be held in Copenhagen in August 1906, which she accepted. Her last public appearance was in the famous mud march organized by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in February 1907. Very soon after this march she underwent surgery for breast cancer and died on 14 April 1908 at her home, 29 Grimston Gardens, Folkestone, Kent. She was buried in Folkestone.<br>
<br>Two years after her death, in 1910, Herbert Phipson established a scholarship in her name at the London School of Medicine for Women valued at &pound;40 per annum (increased to &pound;100 in 1919) to be awarded annually to a medical student &#145;preferably to one coming from India or going to work in India&#146;  (&#145;Edith Pechey Phipson scholarship register, 1912&#150;1948&#146;). The memory of Edith's work lived on in India in the form of the Pechey-Phipson Sanatorium for Women and Children which she had built with her husband in 1895 in Nasik, Maharashtra, India. This institution, which was designed to treat ailing poor women who could not afford expensive convalescent homes, remained in use until 1964.<br>
<br>Surviving records convey little about Edith's personality. Sophia Jex-Blake described Edith as a strong and determined woman who combined great ability with a wonderful sense of humour. An oil portrait of her in full academic regalia was hung in the senate of the University of Bombay. Edith is portrayed as &#145;stiff&#146;, &#145;thin-lipped&#146;, and &#145;stern&#146; in this portrait and her biographer directs us to look at another oil portrait of Edith which hangs in the Cama Hospital as one which brings out her &#145;real beauty, warmth and softness&#146;  (Lutzker, 211).<br>
<br>Revisionist work on the medical movement in the empire and colonies helps us to present a more complex picture of women such as Pechey-Phipson. While some are critical of her depictions of Indian society and her overt use of pseudo-scientific racial theories which denigrated Hindus, others read it as a strategy employed by her to further the emancipation of women, chiefly British women. However, scholars agree that she was a tireless campaigner for equal rights for women in the medical profession.<br>
