<span class="headword">Read, Sir  Herbert Edward</span>  (1893&#150;1968), <span class="occ">poet, literary critic, and writer on art</span>, was born on 4 December 1893 at Muscoates Grange, near Kirkby Moorside, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest of the four children of Herbert Edward Read (1868&#150;1903), tenant farmer, and of Eliza (1867&#150;1914), daughter of William Strickland, also a Kirkby Moorside tenant farmer, and his wife, Sarah. Read gives a dream-like account of his early childhood in the Vale of Pickering in his vivid autobiographical essay <span class="italic">The Innocent Eye</span> (1933).<br>
<br>Read's father, &#145;a man of austere habits and general uprightness&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 31), died of fever following a hunting accident in February 1903. Read and his brother William were sent to board at the spartan Crossley and Porter Orphan Home and School in Halifax, from which Read emerged a precocious Disraelian Conservative. He worked, unhappily, from 1909 to 1912 as a clerk at the Skyrac and Morley Savings Bank in Leeds, but he continued his schooling at evening classes, matriculating in 1911. In 1912, aged nineteen, on the strength of a legacy held in trust by an uncle, Read enrolled at Leeds University, where he studied law and economics. That same year he joined the Leeds Arts Club, home to a northern avant-garde that promoted Nietzsche, theosophy, women's rights, various strands of ethical socialism, and, during the time of Read's membership, modernism in the visual arts. In this setting the markedly dichotomous nature of Read's personality, simultaneously coolly rational and intensely romantic, intellectual and instinctive, began to emerge.<br>
<br>Read formed important friendships with the painter Jacob Kramer and with Frank Rutter, the curator of Leeds City Art Gallery. He gained access to the collection of advanced European art, including work by Gauguin, Kandinsky, and Klee, being formed by the vice-chancellor of Leeds University, Michael Sadler. Read embarked on an eclectic course of extra-curricular study with Nietzsche as his &#145;real teacher&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 86). In 1912 he lost his religious faith in favour of political beliefs shaped through reading John Ruskin, William Morris, Peter Kropotkin, and Georges Sorel. The stimulation he experienced during his course of hard-won self-education left him with a distrust of formally trained minds schooled in classics at Oxford or Cambridge. He knew Latin but no Greek and taught himself French, German, and Italian in order to read poetry.<br>
<br>In 1915 Read was commissioned as a second lieutenant in a battalion of the Yorkshire regiment, the Green Howards. He found his fellow officers, mostly masters and senior boys from Eton and other public schools, less sympathetic than the private soldiers under his command. As he experienced the horror of trench warfare, he discovered that &#145;men of imagination&#146; like himself were &#145;the men of courage&#146;  (Read, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 147). He drew and painted in a vorticist manner and his intense analytical letters from the western battlefront were addressed to a fiercely intelligent Leeds science student, Evelyn May Roff (1894&#150;1972), whom he married on 7 August 1919; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104066/', "John Read (1923&#150;2011)")</script>, later a pioneering documentary film-maker. Read left the army a captain, a convinced pacifist, a war poet, and a youthful war hero who had been awarded the Military Cross (1917) and the DSO (1918).<br>
<br>In 1919 Read joined the civil service, working first in the Ministry of Labour, then at the Treasury, and in 1921 becoming private secretary to the controller of establishments. But his career as a modern poet and literary critic was already well under way. During the course of the war, in snatched opportunities on leave, Read met the key figures in London's literary and artistic modern movement. With Frank Rutter he founded the journal <span class="italic">Art &amp; Letters</span> (1917&#150;20). In 1917 he met and impressed T. S. Eliot and in the autumn of 1918 he came to know the Sitwells, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Richard Aldington, and Ford Madox Ford. He learned his skills as an essayist under the tutelage of A. R. Orage, editor of the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, and in 1921 took over Orage's &#145;Readers and writers&#146; column in that journal.<br>
<br>Read always saw himself primarily as a poet, and his verse was much admired in his lifetime. <span class="italic">Songs of Chaos</span> (1917) was strongly influenced by William Blake and Ralph Hodgson. His subsequent wartime publications, <span class="italic">Naked Warriors</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> (1919), were cooler in tone, in the spirit of the imagist poetry of T. E. Hulme and Ezra Pound. War poems like <span class="italic">Liedholz</span> (1919) had memorable directness but Read's thoroughly decent humanist poetic voice was ultimately ill-served by tight diction and unrelenting emotional logic. However, <span class="italic">Vocal Avowals</span> (1962), a late series of short poems, was truly experimental, coming close to pure sound, untrammelled by verifiable meaning.<br>
<br>From 1923 Read contributed regularly to T. S. Eliot's journal <span class="italic">The Criterion</span> (founded 1922). For Read, Eliot was &#145;rather like a gloomy priest presiding over my affections and spontaneity&#146;  (King, 77). In turn Eliot disliked Read's use of psychoanalytic theory, the results of which were probing if highly subjective. For example, in his fine Clark lectures, delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and published as <span class="italic">Wordsworth</span> (1930), Read's description of the Lakeland poet's character as at once cold and passionate comes close to self-analysis. Read's unswerving commitment to literature was given further practical form when in 1937 he became literary adviser to the publishers Heinemann and Routledge and Kegan Paul. He worked with the latter until 1961, ending up as director. At Routledge's Read was able to give generous support to younger poets such as Sidney Keyes, John Heath Stubbs, and Henry Treece.<br>
<br>In 1922 Read left the civil service for a more congenial post as curator in the department of ceramics and glass in the Victoria and Albert Museum, subsequently becoming the director's assistant. He turned his attention to the applied arts. In <span class="italic">English Pottery</span> (1924), written with Bernard Rackham, Read went beyond classification to discuss national identity and to establish modernist standards of judgement that gave a context for the new art of studio pottery. In 1929 he was invited to contribute &#145;Weekly notes on art&#146; to <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, short essays which were the basis of his brilliantly compressed primer <span class="italic">The Meaning of Art</span> (1931). The foundations for his approach had been laid when he edited T. E. Hulme's <span class="italic">Speculations</span> (1924), leading him to translate Wilhelm Worringer's <span class="italic">Formprobleme der Gotik</span> (1912) as <span class="italic">Form in Gothic</span> (1927). Worringer distinguished between empathetic art, expressing a confidence in the external world, and abstraction, reflecting human alienation and insecurity, thus providing Read with a reasoned justification for the artistic relativism already espoused by Roger Fry.<br>
<br>In 1931 Read took up the Watson Gordon professorship in fine art at the University of Edinburgh. Intellectually this brief academic interlude proved disappointing; Read resigned for personal reasons in 1933, becoming editor of the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> (1933&#150;9). By 1929 his marriage to Evelyn Roff was failing, and in 1933 he left Edinburgh and his professorship precipitately with a young musician, <a href="#cosubject_61933">Margaret Ludwig [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They married on 12 February 1936 following Read's divorce, having already settled in Hampstead, London. There, during the happiest period of his life, Read wrote his only novel, <span class="italic">The Green Child</span> (1935), part adventure story, part contribution to utopian literature. Read's subsequent independence of institutions, particularly academic ones, helped give his thought and writing its daring breadth. But money was always a problem. Alimony paid to his first wife; three further sons and a daughter, all sent at his second wife's behest to Catholic boarding-schools; and in 1949 the purchase of Stonegrave House (a substantial old rectory near his Yorkshire birthplace) condemned Read to a ceaseless round of writing and lecturing, particularly after the Second World War.<br>
<br>Nowhere was Read's independence more marked than in his politics. He was an early critic of Nazi rule in Germany. He rejected Soviet communism and in 1937 he declared himself an anarchist, a decision that brought him moral peace, especially during the cold war. He was associated with the Freedom Press and when four fellow anarchists were arrested in 1945 for possessing and distributing seditious literature he spoke out against the &#145;fascist plutocracy&#146; of post-war government  (Read, <span class="italic">Freedom</span>, 5). He publicly defended a set of principled political values until the end of his life, joining sit-down protests against nuclear war in 1961, deploring the Vietnam War, and refusing to visit Spain under Franco.<br>
<br>Read personified the responsible, artistically minded intellectual in a democratic age. His sensitive, reticent features were recorded by many artists, including a fine drawing by Jacob Kramer (1914), a witty collage by Kurt Schwitters (1944&#150;7), and Barbara Hepworth's haunting <span class="italic">The Poet Reading to his Children</span> (1948), variously showing his strength of character, his sense of fun, and his sweetness of nature. A memorable photograph of the 1940s shows a watchful, smiling Read in a tweed suit, a bow tie, and an anarchist's beret, and holding croquet mallets and hoops.<br>
<br>There were contradictions in Read's anarchism; but it was his second wife who persuaded Read, incongruously, to accept a knighthood for services to literature in 1953. To an extent her ebullient, dominant nature complemented his reserve. The daughter of a shipping broker, Charles Frederick Ludwig, and his wife, Helene Meid, <a name="cosubject_61933"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Read</span>  (1905&#150;1996)<span class="occ"></span> was born at 78 Beaconsfield Place, Aberdeen, on 27 March 1905. She was educated at Aberdeen high school before studying music at Edinburgh University under Donald Tovey. She continued her musical education at Cologne before being appointed to a lectureship in the music department at Edinburgh University, where she first met her husband. Ludo, as she was known to her friends, was a gifted viola player; her ambitions to become a composer were sacrificed for her husband. In post-war Yorkshire she revived the Hovingham Musical Festival and made Stonegrave House an unofficial cultural centre in north Yorkshire. It was a marriage of opposites. In particular her ardent Catholicism clashed with Read's liberal agnosticism. But she inspired Read's finest personal writing, <span class="italic">The Innocent Eye</span>, and the marriage was blessed by &#145;physical affinity and mutual respect&#146;  (King, 150). She died in the Convent of St Nicholas in London on 10 March 1996.<br>
<br>It would be difficult to overestimate Read's importance as an interpreter of continental art and as a supporter of advanced British work in the inter-war period. His contact with German theorists and his awareness of expressive central European and Scandinavian modernism as well as of the school of Paris greatly enriched his polemical <span class="italic">Art Now</span> (1933). In <span class="italic">Art and Industry</span> (1934) Read went on to suggest a practical role for the abstract artist&#151;one he had already hinted at in his editorship of the book <span class="italic">Unit One</span> (1934)&#151;as a designer for mass production. In design and content <span class="italic">Art and Industry</span> combined the Bauhaus principles of Walter Gropius and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy with a historicist sensibility that enabled Read, for instance, to juxtapose eighteenth-century British silver with modern movement metalwork.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Read was a tireless supporter and friend of Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, and Ben Nicholson, but in 1936 his dialogic and generous mind and his psychoanalytical interests led him to endorse and write the catalogue introduction for the International Surrealist Exhibition held at the New Burlington Galleries, London. This was in part to take up a political position in which surrealism stood for individual freedom against the rising tide of fascism in Europe. Similarly liberal ideals informed two further books, <span class="italic">Art and Society</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Education through Art</span> (1943), and his support for the Society for Education through Art and the &#145;Pictures for Schools&#146; exhibitions begun in 1947. As director of the Design Research Unit (1943&#150;5) he sought to involve artists with industry.<br>
<br>After the Second World War Read served on numerous committees. Characteristically, he would sit silently, and suddenly make a quiet remark that would settle the matter. He lectured internationally and wrote influential syntheses such as <span class="italic">A Concise History of Modern Painting</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">A Concise History of Modern Sculpture</span> (1964). He shaped the British art world of the 1950s, supporting individuals, helping set up the Gregory fellowships for poetry, art, and music at Leeds University, co-founding the Institute of Contemporary Art with Roland Penrose in 1947, and selecting a new post-war generation of British sculptors for the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of 1952. But with time he became less receptive to innovation. He found pop art tedious and in 1966 objected to the purchase of Roy Lichtenstein's <span class="italic">Whaam!</span> by the Tate Gallery. In 1964 a malignant tumour was removed from his tongue; however, his programme of work continued relentlessly. In January 1968 Read spoke at the International Cultural Congress at Havana, Cuba; in March he endured the last among a series of painful operations. He died in his sleep at Stonegrave House on 12 June 1968 and was buried three days later at St Gregory's Minster, Kirkdale, the church where he had worshipped as a small boy.<br>
