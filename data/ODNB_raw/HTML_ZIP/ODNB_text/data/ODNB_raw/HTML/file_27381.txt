<span class="headword">Thorpe,  Robert  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1291/2), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born some years before 1250. His surname was derived from Thorpe Acre near Garendon in Leicestershire; the names of his parents are unknown. He studied at Oxford University and by 1271 had already gained a degree; in 1274 he was a party to the peace treaty between the scholars of the north and the scholars of the south which put an end to several months of violent disturbances between the two groups and their allies. By 1281 he had probably entered the service of Master Jordan of Wimborne, the archdeacon of Chester, as he was appointed one of his general attorneys when he went abroad. In the Oxfordshire eyre of 1285 he was among those presented as having been involved in the killing of an Irish tailor, probably during the course of the student disturbances of 1273&#150;4, but when he surrendered to gaol after the eyre was over a jury cleared him of any part in the killing. At the end of 1286 Thorpe was summoned into the king's service in Gascony, and for most of 1287 acted as leader of a group of <i>inquisitores</i>, probably those inquiring into the misconduct of the late seneschal, Jean de Grailly. When most of the justices of the common bench were dismissed in early January 1290, Thorpe was pressed into service as a junior justice, though there is no evidence of his having any previous expertise in the common law. His final term as a justice of the court was Michaelmas term 1291, and it is likely that he died during the following vacation. His heir was his brother Serlo; he was probably also survived by a second brother, John.<br>
