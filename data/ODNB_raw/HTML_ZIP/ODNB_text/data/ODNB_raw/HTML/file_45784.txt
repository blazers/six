<span class="headword">Cadbury <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Taylor]</span>, Dame  Elizabeth Mary</span>  (1858&#150;1951), <span class="occ">welfare worker and philanthropist</span>, was born at 3 Elm Place, Peckham Rye, London, on 24 June 1858; she was born into one Quaker family and married into a second. One of ten children of John Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1894), a company director and stockbroker, and his wife, Mary Jane Cash (<i>d</i>. 1887), her family background was affluent. Her parents were active temperance crusaders, and enthusiasts for the adult education provided by mechanics' institutes. Elizabeth (or Elsie, as she was known) and her sister Margaret were educated privately in Germany, and Elizabeth then attended North London Collegiate School from 1874 to 1876 where Frances Mary Buss was the headmistress. In 1876 she passed the senior Cambridge examination in ten subjects, but did not enter higher education. As the second eldest of the ten children, in what was described as a &#145;large and boisterous family&#146;, Elizabeth taught her younger brothers and sisters. In her childhood and adolescence she loved music.<br>
<br>In the years after leaving school Elizabeth Taylor did social work in the London docks and in Paris. These activities, along with regular teaching in a Quaker Sunday school, show her religious and philanthropic energies. Her work in the London docks, where she started a boys' club in 1884 at the age of twenty-six, was a pioneering effort for a woman of her age, marital status, and class. She also used her musical talent to entertain seamen. Her Parisian experience from February to July 1885 was work with a protestant mission for the relief of victims of the Franco-Prussian War. From July 1885 she worked with women in the London slums.<br>
<br>In 1888 Elizabeth Taylor married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32232/', "George Cadbury (1839&#150;1922)")</script>, a widower with five children. George and his brother Richard were the founders of the Bournville works, and they rebuilt the Cadbury family fortune. George Cadbury's first marriage was in 1872 to Mary Tylor, who died in 1887, and his second wife became stepmother to the five children&#151;his biographer wrote that she did this with &#145;skill and passion&#146;. The Cadburys had a further six children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46801/', "Laurence John Cadbury")</script>, born in 1889; George Norman, born in 1890; Elsie Dorothea (1892); Egbert (1893); Marion Janet (1894); and Ursula (1906). Laurence became, in his turn, chairman of Cadburys. Their family home until 1894 was Woodbrooke in Selly Oak, Birmingham, but in 1894 they moved to the Manor House, Northfield, Birmingham. They lived there together until George's death in 1922, and Elizabeth continued to live there until her own death in 1951. In 1948, at the family gathering to celebrate her ninetieth birthday, there were 150 relatives, and at her death she left thirty-seven grandchildren and forty-nine great-grandchildren.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Cadbury's central work, apart from the rearing of eleven children, was in three spheres: Bournville Village, education and youth work, and the welfare of women. In all these arenas, her efforts were suffused with her Quaker faith. Although it is extremely hard to recreate the religious belief of past generations, commentators on Elizabeth Cadbury are unanimous in their judgement that her Quaker faith was strong, practical, and <i>active</i>: a faith producing practical activity in this world. These activities were grounded in the philanthropic capitalism of the Cadburys in Bournville, working to create a new type of community. The factory was already established at Bournville when George and Elizabeth Cadbury married, but the task of establishing the village was carried through by the couple together. The idea of housing at several price levels mixed together to avoid a one-class community was an original one in the 1890s. Unlike at Port Sunlight, houses at Bournville were not &#145;tied&#146; accommodation, so people who left their jobs with Cadburys did not lose their homes, and non-employees were able to live in Bournville among the Cadbury workers. The pioneering nature of Bournville was publicly recognized by the British Association, who held their annual conference there in 1914 and 1950, and by a royal visit from George V and Queen Mary in 1919. The 200th house at Bournville was opened by Elizabeth Cadbury herself in 1951, and her last public appearance before her death was at the Bournville Village jubilee. She succeeded her husband in chairing the Bournville Village Trust. Her educational work in Bournville included the opening to women of the adult classes (started by George Cadbury) and the establishment of infant schools in 1910. In 1899 she founded an athletic club for young women in Bournville, which opened with a bicycle gymkhana in which both the Cadburys took part.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Cadbury was particularly concerned with disabled and sick children, and in 1909 opened the Woodland Hospital, which became the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital. Later she built The Beeches, to give holidays for children from the Birmingham slums. She chaired the Birmingham school medical service committee and worked energetically to provide medical inspection in schools. From 1941 to 1948 she was president of the United Hospital in Birmingham. Throughout her life she campaigned for the education and welfare of women. She was a convinced non-militant suffragist. The founder in 1898 of the Birmingham Union of Girls' Clubs, she was active in the YWCA and in the National Council for Women from 1896 to her death. In 1936, at the age of seventy-eight, she led the UK delegation to the World Congress of the International Council of Women which was held in Calcutta.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Cadbury was an active pacifist. She was the first chair of the Peace and International Relations Committee of the National Council of Women, established in 1914. In 1916 she was elected to the National Peace Council, becoming its treasurer and then its vice-president. Along with Lady Aberdeen, Millicent Fawcett, and Mrs Corbett Ashby, she pressed for the inclusion of women's issues in the agenda of the Congress of Versailles. She chaired the Peace and Arbitration Committee of the International Council of Women, and was an energetic supporter of the League of Nations Union. In the Second World War, she worked with Belgian refugees, and after that war continued her efforts with the International Council of Women.<br>
<br>In national politics Elizabeth Cadbury's sympathies were similar to those usually associated with Christian socialism, and she was a pillar of the Liberal Party. She was a Birmingham city councillor, for King's Norton ward, from 1919 to 1924, as a Liberal, losing her seat to a Conservative. Her political platform was a reformist one: municipal action in housing improvement, a school health service, and equality of opportunity. Among her political successes were her co-option to the Birmingham education committee in 1919, and her services as a magistrate from 1926.<br>
<br>For her public service Elizabeth Cadbury was made an OBE in 1918 and a DBE in 1934. The Belgian government honoured her in 1918 for her work with refugees, making her an officer of the order of the Crown, and she was decorated by Queen Elizabeth of the Belgians. The Red Cross organizations of Serbia, Greece, and Yugoslavia also made awards to her for her war work. The University of Birmingham made her an honorary MA in 1919 for her services to education and to the city.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Cadbury died at the Manor House, Northfield, Birmingham, on 4 December 1951, and was cremated in Birmingham on the 7th.<br>
