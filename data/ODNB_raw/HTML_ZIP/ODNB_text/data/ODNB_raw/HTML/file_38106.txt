<span class="headword">Wardell,  William Wilkinson</span>  (1823&#150;1899), <span class="occ">architect and engineer</span>, was born on 27 September 1823 at 60 Cotton Street, Poplar, London, the second of the four children of Thomas Wardell (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1864), baker, and his wife, Mary Dalton (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1800). His parents subsequently became master and matron of Poplar union workhouse. Following a spell at sea, he served in the offices of Mr Morris, surveyor to the commissioners of London sewers, and W. F. East, an architect. While surveying land for new railways, he began measuring and drawing medieval buildings. Simultaneously the influence of A. W. N. Pugin drew him to the Roman Catholic church, into which he was received in 1846. On 5 October 1847 he married Lucy Anne (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;1888), daughter of William Henry Butler, wine merchant, of Headington, near Oxford. They had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Wardell designed about thirty Catholic churches, principally in London and the south-east, in a Gothic revival style almost indistinguishable from Pugin's, as well as presbyteries, convents, and schools. His town churches at Clapham (1851), Greenwich (1851), Commercial Road (1856), and Brook Green (1853) rank among the finest work of the 1850s. During these years he was elected FRIBA (1850), freeman of the City of London (1851), member of the Company of Fishmongers (1852), and associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1858).<br>
<br>Owing to the state of his health, Wardell sold his practice to Messrs Hadfield and Goldie of Sheffield, and emigrated to Australia with his family in 1858. As inspector-general of public works in Victoria from 1861, he was responsible for such undertakings as docks and harbours, as well as government buildings. Holding also the right of private practice, he designed churches and schools in and around Melbourne, principally St Patrick's Cathedral, finally consecrated in 1897. His career in Melbourne ended abruptly when all principal officers were dismissed on &#145;black Wednesday&#146; 1878 in a government upheaval. He then moved to Sydney, where he confined himself to private practice, designing churches, houses, clubs, and banks in a variety of styles&#151;renaissance, Gothic, and vernacular&#151;and becoming thereby a significant figure.<br>
<br>Wardell's principal contribution to his age lay in his church work. His article in the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> (1849&#150;50) demonstrates his concern for building within reasonable financial limits, his care for responsible historicism, and above all a strong commitment to the revived Gothic style. Never as fanatical as Pugin, however, Wardell compromised his commitment to Gothic with Italianate designs at St Mary in Hampstead, Sts Peter and Edward in Westminster, and Government House in Melbourne. His drawings of his English work, which survive in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, demonstrate also his competence in designing such furnishings as altars, screens, fonts, and stained glass.<br>
<br>Despite suffering from tuberculosis, Wardell worked energetically and efficiently. The advice of A. S. Hamilton in 1869 &#145;to rest your exhausted brain&#146;  (de Jong, 9) suggests a busy lifestyle of endless examinations, commissions, reports, surveys, and designs. With hindsight, his dismissal in 1878 was a blessing. Throughout those stormy years, however, he had refuted criticisms of his work with patience and gentle good manners. Formative influences here were his happy marriage and his staunch commitment to his Catholic faith. Wardell died at his home, Upton Grange, Sydney, on 19 November 1899 and was buried at Gore Hill cemetery, Sydney.<br>
