<span class="headword">Rank,  Joseph</span>  (1854&#150;1943), <span class="occ">flour miller and philanthropist</span>, was born at Holderness Road in Hull on 28 March 1854, the second of four sons (the eldest died in infancy) of James Rank (1829&#150;1874), miller, and his first wife, Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of Joseph Parrott, a Hull shipowner. He showed little promise at the Revd Haynes's school at Swinefleet near Goole. When at fourteen he joined the family mill, his father rated him good for nothing, and on James Rank's death in 1874, the executors handed him &pound;500 and told him to look elsewhere. Rank set up his own mill, and on 15 June 1880 married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of Robert Voase, farmer, of Ellerby, near Hull. Gentle and industrious, she was the ideal helpmate for a man resolved to make good by living on a shoestring. She brought up their three sons (there were also three daughters) to become achievers despite their father's domineering behaviour towards them, the result of his own unhappy childhood.<br>
<br>While his subsequent pre-eminence as a flour miller undoubtedly owed a lot to good fortune, Rank had a shrewd understanding of his industry. Quick to exploit new technology, he was a first-rate dealer in commodities, being able to make a profit even in conditions of overcapacity and depressed trading. In 1885 he built the Alexandra mill at Hull, incorporating the latest technology of roller-milling, and six years later the Clarence mills, among the most modern in Britain. He increased his profits by importing wheat direct rather than through dealers. He subsequently erected other mills close to English and Welsh ports which had deep water access and could receive shipments of foreign grain. In 1899 the company became Joseph Rank Ltd, with a capital of &pound;700,000. Five years later Rank moved the head office to London.<br>
<br>During the early 1880s Rank underwent a religious conversion to strict Methodism. Almost his whole life thereafter was devoted to living his simple and childlike faith: he once told his employees that he did not put down all his success to himself, much being due to God and much to themselves. He made his family attend services three times on Sundays, and forbade liquor and tobacco, theatregoing, and dancing in public. Energetic dances at home, however, were permitted, as were visits to the circus.<br>
<br>A lifelong cricketing addict, Rank took the family to Scarborough annually for the cricket festival. In later years, he often slipped away to Lord's on summer afternoons, with a packet of sandwiches and some ginger pop. Parsimonious to a fault, he avoided eating out, and walked rather than using transport. He did exercises every morning, had an excellent digestion, slept soundly, and to the end remained lithe and energetic. He was a Victorian at heart, paternalistic and mildly eccentric. As an ardent phrenologist, he kept a plaster head in his office, and selected employees by their cranial characteristics.<br>
<br>Having resisted the temptation in the 1890s to sell his firm and become an evangelist, Rank did the next best thing and gave away most of his wealth. He supported Hull Royal Infirmary and in 1934 endowed the Joseph Rank Benevolent Fund with &pound;300,000 to relieve poverty in the city. Between 1920 and his death he gave over &pound;3.5 million to Methodist causes. His wife died in 1916, and on 3 October 1918 he married her widowed sister, Annie Maria Witty (<i>d</i>. 1940).<br>
<br>In the First World War, Rank served on the Wheat Control Board. After 1918 his sons James Voase Rank and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31585/', "Joseph Arthur Rank")</script> were in day-to-day charge. Ranks, the largest milling combine in Britain and one of the largest in the world, continued to expand. The Second World War brought Rank both personal sorrow, with the death of his second wife in 1940, and commercial setbacks when eight mills were wrecked by bombing. Rank himself died at his Surrey home, Colley Corner, Reigate Heath, on 13 November 1943.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_48137"></a><span class="headword">James Voase Rank</span>  (1881&#150;1952)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Wilton Street in Hull on 10 May 1881. He was educated at Hymers College, Hull, and at Weston College, Harrogate. He trained with a firm of wheat merchants, and then joined the company on the commercial side, becoming a prominent wheat buyer on the Baltic exchange. In 1907 he was made a director, and on 9 April that year he married Ursula Mary, daughter of Evan Tadman Ferrier, with whom he had a daughter.<br>
<br>As his father's right-hand man, and later as managing director, James Voase Rank steadily increased the number of the company's mills, and became a national figure in the milling business. In 1928&#150;9, as president of its national association, he devised a scheme for rationalizing the industry, which involved quotas and buying in redundant capacity.<br>
<br>From 1938 onwards the government employed Rank's skills, first to build up a strategic reserve of wheat, and later as director of the Ministry of Food's imported cereals division, a post he continued to hold until his death. In a typically unbureaucratic manner, he oversaw the purchase, importation, and distribution of all cereals and cereal products in Britain, and subsequently for India, other British colonies, and various allied countries. As he was simultaneously president of the millers' national association, he came under criticism for the conflicts of interest the holding of these two posts entailed.<br>
<br>With an enjoyment of life and abundant energy, in sharp contrast to his father, James Voase Rank was a twentieth-century man through and through. Although still a Methodist, in 1926 he divorced his wife and on 10 May the following year married a divorcee, Mrs Patricia Edytha Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1954). There were no children of the marriage. A director of the International Horse Show and a member of the Kennel Club committee, in Surrey he bred horses and dogs. He won awards for his shorthorn cattle. He became a racehorse owner and&#151;to his father's consternation&#151;bought a stud near Salisbury in 1934, winning the St Leger four years later. His philanthropy, mainly to hospitals and charitable institutions, was unostentatiously exercised. He died in the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, on 3 January 1952.<br>
