<span class="headword">Lyttelton, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1595/6&#150;1650), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and politician</span>, was the eldest son of John Lyttelton MP (1561&#150;1601) of Hagley, Worcestershire, and Muriel (<i>d</i>. 1630), daughter of Sir Thomas Bromley, lord chancellor. His father was implicated in Essex's rising (February 1601), and, after being convicted of high treason, died in prison. Thomas matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 22 June 1610, but was a member of Broadgates Hall when he supplicated for the BA degree (2 July 1614). In 1613 he became a student of the Inner Temple. Lyttelton was both knighted and created a baronet in July 1618. He married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1666), daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Crompton of Driffield, Yorkshire, and Hounslow, Middlesex; they had twelve sons and four daughters. He represented Worcestershire in the parliaments of 1621&#150;2, 1624&#150;5, 1625, 1626, and April&#150;May 1640, and in 1640 he served as high sheriff for the county.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the civil war Lyttelton offered to raise a regiment of foot and a troop of horse for the king. Charles I consulted him at Shrewsbury in September 1642 about troop movements, and appointed him colonel of the Worcestershire horse and foot (3 September 1642), praising his &#145;approved fidelity, wisdom, valour and circumspection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Townshend</span>, 2.86). By the beginning of 1643 he was governor of Bewdley, but the county's royalists lacked supplies and failed to overcome their neighbours' indifference. In May 1644 Bewdley, poorly fortified, was taken by a parliamentary force masquerading as stragglers from Prince Rupert's army, and Lyttelton was captured in bed at Tickenhill by Colonel &#145;Tinker&#146; Fox. He was sent to the Tower of London, and though released on bail, was recommitted (29 November 1644), by parliament, fearful of his influence in Worcestershire. His house at Frankley was burnt to the ground by Prince Rupert to make it unavailable to the parliamentary troops. On 6 March 1645 parliament fined him &pound;4000 for his delinquency, and he was still a prisoner in June 1646. He died at Newcastle House, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, on 22 February 1650, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's fifth but eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_17308"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Lyttelton</span>, second baronet  (1623/4&#150;1693), <span class="occ">royalist politician</span>, succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 12 September 1640. His first marriage was to Philadelphia (<i>d</i>. 2 Aug 1663), daughter of the Hon. Thomas Carey, groom of the bedchamber to Charles I. She was maid of honour to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Secondly he married, on 2 November 1665, at Wroxeter, Shropshire, Lady Elizabeth Newport (<i>d</i>. 7 March 1724), daughter of Francis Newport, first earl of Bradford. A royalist, he was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), and was imprisoned in the Tower until April 1653 on a charge of providing arms without licence to the Scottish army.<br>
<br>On his release Lyttelton joined the action party of royalist conspirators in the midlands, and, as high sheriff of Worcestershire (1654&#150;5), he was able to purchase arms. Although he took no part in Penruddock's rising (1655)&#151;he may have been deterred from this by the arrest of his brother Charles&#151;he was implicated, with two of his brothers, in Booth's insurrection (1659) and was again committed to the Tower, where, treated with great respect, he appears to have remained until the Restoration. Charles II wrote to him from Brussels, full of appreciation for his sacrifices and promising future rewards.<br>
<br>Described by his brother Charles (16 August 1664) as &#145;dry, illiberal&#146; and &#145;troubled with his fits of the spleen&#146;  (Thompson, 1.36), Lyttelton refused in 1661 both a peerage and an invitation to stand as MP for Worcestershire. He preferred to live on his estates at Upper Arley, Staffordshire (now in Worcestershire), where his vineyards produced light wines pronounced indistinguishable from those of France. At a by-election (21 February 1678) he became MP for Lichfield, but he served on no committees and made no speeches. He retained his seat (March&#150;July 1679) but became totally inactive in parliament, and was even absent at the division on the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. Indeed he refused all further invitations to stand as MP for Worcestershire and for Lichfield. He was a JP for Worcestershire and Shropshire, deputy lieutenant for Worcestershire and Staffordshire, a freeman of Worcester and an alderman of Bewdley. He died, without children, at Upper Arley on 24 June 1693, and was buried in the local church, where a monument to his memory was erected. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17304/', "Charles Lyttelton (1629&#150;1716)")</script>.<br>
