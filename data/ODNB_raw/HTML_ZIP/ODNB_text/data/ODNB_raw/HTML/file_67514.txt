<span class="headword">Balfour,  John, of Kinloch</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1663&#150;1683), <span class="occ">covenanter</span>, was the son of John Balfour (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1652), portioner of Kinloch, in the parish of Collessie, and his wife, Grissel Hay (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1653). Served heir to his grandfather Robert Balfour on 26 February 1663, he was described as a &#145;broad man&#146; with &#145;farid dusk brown hair&#146;  (NA Scot., JC2/15, fol. 224<i>r</i>). He married Barbara Hackston, sister of David Hackston of Rathillet, and they had a son, perhaps named David. In July 1672 and 1676 Balfour was called before the privy council for attending conventicles, but refused to appear, leaving him open to arrest. In January 1678 he is listed as not having signed the bond for public peace and in the same year he is among those heritors in the parish of Collessie who had not signed the bond against conventicles and disorderly walking. In March 1678 between sixty and eighty armed men met at his house and attacked a troop of horse under Captain Carstares sent by the privy council to capture conventiclers. Balfour participated in the murder of Archbishop Sharp on Magnus Muir (Moor) on 3 May 1679, at which his brother-in-law Hackston was present. He escaped to the west of Scotland and was involved in the declaration of Rutherglen on 29 May 1679, which condemned past violations of the covenants and the reintroduction of episcopacy, and which preceded a covenanter rising. He was one of the officers of the covenanting army at the battle of Drumclog on 1 June 1679 under the name of Captain Burghlie. On 22 June 1679 he took part in the covenanter defeat at the battle of Bothwell Bridge and was among those proclaimed traitors on 26 June. On 14 August 1679 a reward of 10,000 merks and indemnity was offered for Balfour and Hackston for participation in Sharp's murder. Balfour fled to Holland about October 1679 and a process of treason was raised against him about January 1683. On 2 April 1683 the lords of justiciary deemed him a traitor and his goods were pronounced forfeit. His later career is unclear, &#145;and nothing certain is known of his last deeds and days&#146;  (Hewison, 2.512).<br>
