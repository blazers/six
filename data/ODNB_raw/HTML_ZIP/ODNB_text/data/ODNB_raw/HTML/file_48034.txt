<span class="headword">Tabor,  Robert Stammers</span>  (1819&#150;1909), <span class="occ">headmaster and Church of England clergyman</span>, born in Colchester on 14 February 1819, was the son of Robert Tabor. He was educated at a private school in Essex, before matriculating as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1838, graduating BA in 1842 as twenty-fourth senior optime in the mathematical tripos, and proceeding MA in 1848. Ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1844, he was curate to Henry Montagu Villiers, later bishop of Carlisle, at St George's, Bloomsbury, from 1842 to 1844, before being presented in 1844 to the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Enfield, by the patron, Robert Cooper Lee Bevan (1809&#150;90). He married on 7 March 1845 Mary, second daughter of Francis Dollman, perpetual curate of St Mark's, Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>Villiers and Bevan, a wealthy banker who had built Christ Church, Cockfosters, had become interested in the fortunes of Cheam School, a private classical school which was in a low state and facing closure. They agreed that Bevan should buy out the sitting head, Henry Shepheard (<i>c</i>.1809&#150;1878), a former fellow of Oriel College, and headmaster since 1846. Tabor, who had supplemented his stipend at Enfield by taking private pupils, was to be installed in Shepheard's place. On becoming headmaster of Cheam in 1855 Tabor set about converting it into a private preparatory school catering for boys up to the age of fourteen. This soon proved a success and numbers rapidly grew; by 1864 there were 100 pupils. Cheam School built up a reputation as a nursery for Eton College and attracted a fashionable clientele; pupils under Tabor included (Lord) Randolph Churchill. In 1874 Tabor was joined by his son Arthur Sydney Tabor (1851&#150;1927), a Cambridge cricket blue, who succeeded his father as headmaster from 1891 to 1920. His eldest son, Robert Montagu Tabor (1845&#150;1925), educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, was assistant secretary to the Board of Education from 1903 to 1909. In all Tabor had seven sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>On 15 December 1887 Tabor married again; his second wife was Annie, daughter of J. Harvey, a barrister. After his retirement in 1890 he lived at 64 St George's Square, London, where he died on 14 January 1909.<br>
