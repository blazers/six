<span class="headword">Somerset,  Edward</span>, second marquess of Worcester  (<em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">courtier and scientist</span>, was the first son of Henry Somerset, fifth earl and first marquess of Worcester (1577&#150;1646), and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1639), daughter and heir of John, Lord Russell, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Anthony Cook of Gidea Hall, Essex. Styled Lord Herbert from 1628 when his father inherited the earldom, he was educated privately at Raglan Castle, Monmouthshire, and brought up as a Catholic. Granted a pass to travel abroad for three years from 5 August 1619, he visited Germany, France, and Italy. In 1627 the MA degree of Cambridge University was bestowed upon him, although he attended no college.<h2>
<a name="Scientificinterestsandmilitarycareer"></a>Scientific interests and military career</h2>During the years of the mid-1620s Lord Herbert was admitted to the circle of courtiers around the new king, Charles I, and began to take an active interest in experimental science: these two developments were to form the most important dimensions of his life. About 1628 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1635), daughter of Sir William Dormer and his wife, Alice, whose father was Sir Richard Molyneux. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26009/', "Henry Somerset, first duke of Beaufort")</script>, and two daughters before Elizabeth's death on 31 May 1635. Although he held public office, such as membership of the council in the marches of Wales (12 May 1633) and a deputy lord lieutenancy in Monmouthshire from November 1635, Herbert's principal interests before 1640 were private, and scientific. At Raglan, from the time of his marriage, he employed a Dutch engineer, Caspar Calthoff, to assist him with experiments at the castle. Although no surviving trace of it was ever found during twentieth-century conservation work there, it is possible that a machine employing the propulsive properties of steam was constructed to raise water to the full height of the great tower. Another interest of Lord Herbert was perpetual motion, and he claimed to have devised a machine to demonstrate that principle. In August 1639 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1681), second daughter of Henry O'Brien, fourth earl of Thomond; the marriage brought him into contact with members of the Irish peerage. During 1641 he was acting as one of the king's retinue, and on 7 December he was assured by Charles, setting out for the north, that if the king lived, Herbert would &#145;neither be a loser in, nor repent you for the services you have done me&#146;  (Dircks, 33).<br>
<br>As early as January 1642 the citizens of Gloucester feared the consequences for their city if the Catholic Raglan interest were to be mobilized against them. On the outbreak of civil war the Somerset family was an important financial resource for the king, its estates being valued in December 1641 at between &pound;40,000 and &pound;100,000. The controller of this fabulous wealth was Herbert's father, the fifth earl, created first marquess of Worcester on 2 March 1643 in recognition of his major contribution to Charles's war chest. Herbert acted as agent between the king and his father for some of these advances. As early as 3 September 1642 the House of Commons demanded Herbert's presence as a corollary of the Lords' attempts to disarm his father, and in February 1643 parliament called upon the king to rid himself of the services of both father and son. In the opening months of the war Herbert was busy fortifying Raglan, first moving the Monmouthshire powder magazine from Monmouth to Caerleon, and thence to Raglan; and setting up garrisons in Cardiff, Brecon, Hereford, and at Goodrich Castle. These movements heightened the mood of anxiety among the aldermen of Gloucester, who reported to parliament their interrogation of Herbert's servants. News circulated in November 1642 that a force of 7000 Welsh led by the marquess of Hertford and Herbert had engaged the parliamentarian earl of Stamford near Tewkesbury in a fierce battle. Herbert was supposedly personally prominent, but the reports were propaganda, probably manufactured in Gloucester. Recriminations between Herbert and Hertford developed not as a consequence of military defeat but through personal rivalry exacerbated by Herbert's role as Hertford's paymaster. The king sent a representative to try to repair the breach between them.<br>
<br>By January 1643 Herbert was substituting for Hertford as a field commander, and he became general of south Wales. In any assessment of regional military objectives the taking of Gloucester was bound to figure strongly. After an incident at Coleford in the Forest of Dean when some villagers killed three of his officers, a force of 1500 foot and 500 horse under Herbert's command camped at Highnam, outside Gloucester, in preparation for an assault on the city. On 24 March 1643 they allowed themselves to be ignominiously taken prisoner by Sir William Waller. Herbert, who was not present, blamed others for the disaster, which marked the end of royalist plans to take Gloucester. Nothing daunted by this setback, which might have called Herbert's competence as a commander into question, on 6 April Charles appointed him lieutenant-general, and added Monmouthshire to his command. At Abergavenny on 15 April royalists from Herbert's associated counties were summoned to Hereford, but there was local reluctance to flock to the standard. The earl of Clarendon, while admitting that &#145;many men loved and very few hated&#146; Herbert  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.479), recognized that his Roman Catholicism and his habit of keeping away from his own forces were an obstacle to any success he might have had as a field commander. Clarendon dismissed Herbert's hastily assembled &#145;mushrump [mushroom] army&#146;  (ibid., 2.483) as a wasted opportunity, and Herbert failed subsequently to re-establish himself as a general, despite some evidence of successes in small skirmishes in the Welsh border country. His relations with the two other royalist leaders in his region, Prince Rupert and the marquess of Hertford, were never better than polite. The height of his achievement down to the spring of 1645 was thus in quelling local unrest and helping repair garrisons in Monmouthshire.<h2>
<a name="AsecretmissiontoIreland"></a>A secret mission to Ireland</h2>Given his disappointing performance as a military leader it may appear odd that Lord Herbert was selected by Charles I in 1644 for a secret mission to Ireland that called for extraordinary personal and persuasive powers. The story of his mission to Ireland has since the nineteenth century exercised the judgements of historians, and has provoked sharply differing responses among them. Herbert's first association with Irish service dates from 1 April 1644, when he was apparently commissioned to take command of troops to be raised in Ireland and shipped to England in the interest of the king. Herbert was to be &#145;generalissimo&#146;  (Dircks, 70) of three armies from England, Ireland, and the continent of Europe. The authenticity of this commission (and that of many other documents produced by Herbert in connection with his later Irish mission) was brought into question as long ago as 1735 by Thomas Carte, biographer of James Butler, duke of Ormond, but modern commentators tend cautiously to consider it genuine. What qualified Herbert for this service were his long association with the king, who liked at least to be considered loyal to his friends, his work in making available the Raglan fortune for the king's cause&#151;the contribution acknowledged on 12 February 1645 by the king to amount by that time to &pound;250,000&#151;and his Irish contacts through his wife. The king's dealings with the Somersets had always been characterized by a noble, perhaps romantically chivalrous generosity on the part of the family, rewarded by Charles with promises that were difficult to keep and usually accompanied by an enjoinder to secrecy. Privileges promised to Herbert in return for this command included the hand of the king's daughter, Elizabeth, for his son Henry, and the dukedom of Somerset. The whole scheme collapsed, however, when in May agents of the Irish Catholic confederation were dismissed from Charles's court at Oxford, and negotiations with the Irish were placed in the hands of the protestant marquess of Ormond. The king wrote to Ormond, lord lieutenant of Ireland, on 27 December 1644, implying that Lord Herbert was to be subordinate to him when the latter was to visit Ireland, primarily on his own business. At this point Charles did everything to confirm to Ormond his confidence in him and his lack of any formal investment of trust in Herbert. To Ormond, he wrote of Herbert: &#145;His honesty or affection to my service will not deceive you; but I will not answer for his judgment&#146;  (Carte, 5.7&#150;8). Nevertheless, from January 1645 onwards, a series of rather oddly worded commissions were issued to Herbert, who from this point was styled earl of Glamorgan. The title itself, along with that of Baron Beaufort of Caldecot Castle which he claimed from the same time, has always been controversial. No patent passed the great seal until 31 January 1646, and even then doubts remain as to whether it was ever more than a titular earldom: it was probably originally conceived by Charles as an inducement, to be bestowed in the event of Herbert's success in Ireland.<br>
<br>Charles's intention seems to have been that Glamorgan should have full power to negotiate a treaty with the confederates on terms dictated by them, which would have been unacceptable to the protestant Ormond. Most modern assessments of Charles's character have agreed on his principled commitment to the Church of England, so it seems less likely that the king had settled on selling out the Anglican church in Ireland than on allowing the Glamorgan mission to proceed as a dimension in a complex royal game of diplomacy. On 12 February 1645 Charles gave Glamorgan a further warrant for the title of duke of Somerset, and on 12 March the earl received a warrant empowering him to negotiate a secret treaty with the Catholic confederates. On 25 March he sailed for Ireland. After being shipwrecked on the English coast he was inevitably delayed, and did not reach Dublin until late June. By this time the king's need for an injection of more troops and an opening of a new front in the civil war was acute, in the wake of his defeat at Naseby on 14 June.<br>
<br>Before Glamorgan's arrival in Ireland Ormond had been engaged in peace negotiations with the confederates, in which he had insisted that the Catholic church should not be allowed to retain its property: his refusal to move on this point appeared to be strengthening the hand of the peace party. On 6 August Glamorgan set out for Kilkenny and first appeared to be assisting Ormond in his discussions with the confederates there, but within three weeks he had concluded on 25 August a separate, secret treaty of his own. It went beyond anything previously in the public domain in making concessions to Catholics. All penal laws in Ireland were to be abandoned, Irish Catholics were to be exempt from protestant clerical jurisdiction, and in return the confederates were to provide 10,000 soldiers under Glamorgan's command for use anywhere in the three nations of the British Isles. The principal beneficiaries of the Glamorgan treaty would have been the Irish Catholic clergy, and despite the misgivings of the papal representative, Scarampi, a majority in the Catholic episcopate endorsed it when details leaked out. That Charles himself had not been consulted in detail on the terms of Glamorgan's concessions is suggested by the king's warning of 31 July to Ormond against too readily satisfying Irish Catholic expectations; but the yielding to confederate demands by Glamorgan was not an unreasonable surrender by one who was after all himself a devout Catholic. There is compelling evidence that Glamorgan shared his thinking with others in Ormond's negotiating team, who imposed an oath of their own on Glamorgan to compel him to deploy his promised army only when Charles had expressly given instructions for its use. Between 7 August and 24 December 1645 Glamorgan wrote fourteen letters to Ormond, couched in vague, extravagant terms, but broadly adhering to the line that he had come to help Ormond, not to open rival negotiations: this evidence can be taken to mean that Ormond himself was thus kept in the dark. An alternative reading of the Byzantine correspondence between the two is that Ormond knew of Glamorgan's plans, but had to maintain an official ignorance of them. Glamorgan's &#145;defeasance&#146;, a document he drew up on 26 August, was probably designed as his plan to protect Charles should his scheming fail, rather than as simply an admission by Glamorgan that he had strayed way beyond his commission.<br>
<br>In the event the details of negotiations in Kilkenny proved harder to conclude than the simplistic Glamorgan predicted, and it was mid-September before he could return to Dublin to rejoin the alternative negotiations pursued by Ormond. A further setback arrived in the shape of the new papal nuncio, Rinuccini, who was sceptical that Glamorgan could through his own dubious authority implement the religious concessions to the confederates at the core of the treaty. Even before Rinuccini's arrival Scarampi had distrusted Glamorgan's insistence that the treaty should be secret. Such secrecy that did prevail was already compromised by the diffusion of details of the treaty among the confederate general assembly and the Catholic episcopate, beyond the confederate treaty committee. Rinuccini appears to have suborned Glamorgan to his own proposals for even greater concessions to the Catholic church than those in the secret treaty. A sympathetic view of Glamorgan in his collapse before the nuncio's demands must stress the immediacy of the need for Irish troops to arrive in Chester before it fell, perhaps for ever, to parliament, and Glamorgan virtually alone among the royalist negotiators saw the virtue of persisting in negotiations with the nuncio. His critics, by contrast, will note this episode as further evidence of Glamorgan's hare-brained and quixotic character.<br>
<br>On 28 November 1645 Ormond was evidently still not willing to acknowledge the secret treaty, but its terms found their way to the English parliament after 17 October, when a copy was seized from the baggage train of the ambushed Catholic archbishop of Tuam by a Scots raiding party. On 26 December Glamorgan was brought before Ormond and was charged with treason by Lord Digby. After a theatrical demonstration at this meeting by Ormond that he knew nothing of Glamorgan's activities, it was decided to keep the earl in custody. Letters written by Glamorgan during his captivity strongly suggest that he had every confidence that his detention would be brief, and that he believed himself to be carrying out a scheme that the king must approve of. The pressing military considerations that had quickly wrung concessions from Glamorgan by Rinuccini now worked to secure the earl's release, and on 22 January 1646 he was freed on bail of &pound;40,000. Glamorgan continued to play a part in the negotiations with the confederates, unaware that Charles had repudiated his treaty. Rinuccini now refused to accept the earl's credentials, on the grounds that he had never been formally cleared of treason. During February Glamorgan bent his efforts towards bringing the Ormondists and Rinuccini to the negotiating table, and managed to secure the prolongation of the cessation of arms. On 24 February he set out for Waterford to arrange for the ferrying of troops to England. He planned to send 6000 immediately and another 4000 in May. The date of departure from Ireland was fixed for 18 March: three ports of embarkation were identified. But Chester fell to parliament on 3 February, money and ships did not appear in the necessary quantities, and news broke that Charles had repudiated Glamorgan's commission. This marked the virtual collapse of Glamorgan's plans and of his personal credit in Ireland. On 3 February Charles wrote to the earl to distance himself from what had occurred, asserting that none of these misfortunes would have happened if Glamorgan had listened to Ormond. Three Irish regiments raised by Glamorgan for deployment in England were diverted on 8 April by the confederate council for service in co. Clare. When in June 1646 Glamorgan's father threatened the Monmouthshire parliamentarian committee with the forces his sons were bringing from Ireland, they were dismissed by his local opponents as &#145;jesuitical inventions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter from the Marquess of Worcester</span>).<h2>
<a name="Theinterregnumandinventions"></a>The interregnum and inventions</h2>Until March 1648 Glamorgan remained in Ireland as a member of a new council of the confederates. He was admitted to civic honours in Waterford and Galway, and commanded an army in Munster from September 1646 until June 1647, when he was displaced by Lord Muskerry. He assured the Spanish agent in Ireland that he would send men to serve in Spain under Philip IV, but his offer was politely declined on the grounds that there seemed little substance to the proposals other than as a bargaining ploy with the Spanish. In the aftermath of the collapse of the king's cause Raglan had surrendered on 19 August 1646, and Glamorgan's father and wife were in the castle at the time. The subsequent sequestration of the family estates in south Wales and elsewhere made a return to Monmouthshire impossible for him. He had inherited his patrimonial title of marquess of Worcester in December 1646, on the death of his father, and the new marquess made for France in March 1648, spending most of the remainder of the 1640s in and around Paris.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1649 the Commonwealth government named Worcester among those royalists who were to suffer banishment and the confiscation of estates, but in practice, the republican government conducted itself towards him with more leniency than his history of plotting with the confederates might have deserved. In April 1651 Oliver Cromwell, the principal beneficiary of the confiscation of the Somerset family's estates, warned his wife of a possible visit from Worcester's son, and was particularly anxious lest receiving a member of the family should be construed as a form of political corruption. Despite the order of banishment Worcester was back in England by 28 July 1652, when a parliamentary order confined him to the Tower of London. With the advent of the Cromwellian protectorate, Worcester was treated with greater leniency. On 5 October 1654 he was released from the Tower on bail, and on 26 June 1655 an order under Cromwell's hand was signed for him to receive a weekly pension of &pound;3. This could do little more than blunt the extremity of his circumstances, but he was free to resume his scientific work, in which the government took some interest. Worcester's former collaborator, Calthoff, had left England for the Netherlands, where he resumed experiments involving the motive power of steam to raise water. The English government wanted in February 1652 to interview Calthoff with a view to sponsoring him, and set aside Vauxhall, south of the Thames in London, as a space for scientific and related experimentation.<br>
<br>Apart from personal sympathy towards Worcester shown by Cromwell, the intellectual curiosity which marked interregnum regimes may have accounted for Worcester's rehabilitation. By 1655 Worcester's old partnership with Calthoff had resumed, and the marquess wrote a catalogue of his inventions (eventually published in 1663), in the self-justifying mode that was typical of him, and probably designed to attract sponsorship. <span class="italic">A century of the names and scantlings of &hellip; inventions</span> is an eclectic mixture of detail and the sketchiest of outlines, and even Worcester's most determined apologist, Henry Dircks, writing in 1865, was unable to provide explanatory glosses for all the inventions listed. However, it is the &#145;water commanding engine&#146; which has excited most interest among historians of science, because its inventor claimed to have found a way to &#145;drive up water by fire&#146;  (Dircks, 475). Although the word &#145;steam&#146; was not used as a term in science or engineering until after Worcester's death, the water commanding engine appears to have been powered by that means, and thus the marquess has been promoted, most vigorously by Dircks, as an inventor of the steam engine. Victorian commentators, writing in the great age of steam power, were more ready to dismiss Worcester's claims than their successors of a century later. In the continuing absence of any archaeological or other physical evidence, a definitive verdict seems as elusive as ever, but it seems that Calthoff's contribution was probably greater than that of his employer, that steam power was indeed deployed at Vauxhall in a prototype of the water commanding engine, but that it was ultimately unsuccessful.<h2>
<a name="TheRestorationandlastyears"></a>The Restoration and last years</h2>In June 1660 Worcester provided the earl of Clarendon with an account of his activities in Ireland, which emphasized his own motives of self-sacrifice in the interests of the late king, and placed his London residence, Worcester House, in the Strand, at his disposal. The same month he petitioned Charles II for the return of his estates, and the House of Lords accordingly ordered their restitution. There was no heaping of rewards on the Somerset family, however, probably because of Clarendon's continuing suspicions of the marquess. His son was imprisoned briefly in 1660, and in September the title of duke of Somerset was removed from him after an investigation by the Lords of its dubious legality. In July 1661 he successfully pleaded parliamentary privilege to stave off his creditors, and on 3 June 1663, the royal assent was given to an act which provided Worcester with a patent for his water commanding engine.<br>
<br>While his son, Henry, Lord Herbert, was busy reconstructing the Somerset family's political interest, now based at Badminton, across the three counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Monmouthshire, the marquess confined himself to scientific experiments at Vauxhall, and to attempts at extricating himself from the debts he estimated at &pound;20,000, which kept him &#145;not only from a competent maintenance, but even from sleep&#146;  (Dircks, 280). He and his wife continued to petition the king for relief from his financial distress. In the final months of his life he wrote for the Lords an autobiographical review of his dealings on behalf of Charles I, inhibited from delivering it verbally through &#145;prolixity of speech, and a natural defect of utterance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Beaufort MSS</span>, 56). Ever inclined to the grand gesture Worcester declared that he would establish a horse troop, build new highways into London, and provide &pound;10,000 for rebuilding St Paul's Cathedral, all presumably from the profits of the water commanding engine. These meaningless announcements were but an ornament to his real motives: to reveal his calculation that he had spent &pound;918,000 in public service, and to declare himself bewildered that he had been unrewarded since the restoration of the king. The marquess died on 3 April 1667. His remains were conveyed to Raglan where he was buried on 19 April. He was survived by his wife, and his son, Henry, succeeded to the title. Calthoff died soon afterwards, and no more is heard of the water commanding engine after the faith in it of its promoters died with them. Dircks cites a letter from a Catholic priest which discouraged the marquess's widow from pursuing the potential benefits of the &#145;great machine&#146;  (Dircks, 304), but the limitations of available technology are more likely to have proved fatal to its survival than the criticisms of any perceived opponents of rational inquiry.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>At first glance Worcester's careers as a scientific entrepreneur, civil war commander in the Welsh marches, and as a diplomat in Ireland appear sharply differentiated. Running through all these activities in the public sphere, however, was a lofty, quixotic ambition which outran his powers of judgement. He was imaginative, perhaps even visionary in his patronage of hydraulic engineering, but was never able wholly to persuade the scientific community in his own age of his achievement. It was left to Victorian commentators to rescue his reputation as an engineer. As a military commander and as a diplomat his dedication to the cause of Charles I was conceived in high-flown terms and was ill-requited by his king. The special status of his family as the king's prime private source of finance did not help Worcester take a realistic view of what he could achieve, nor did it endear him to his military colleagues in the royal cause. Even after 1660 he was genuinely anguished that his commitment and boldness were never properly rewarded, but under the restored monarchy his chivalrous, studious, but enterprising character seemed less suited than ever to the worldly, cynical spirit of the times.<br>
