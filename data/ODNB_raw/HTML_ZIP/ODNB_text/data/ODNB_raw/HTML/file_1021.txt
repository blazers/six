<span class="headword">Badger,  George Percy</span>  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">Arabic scholar and missionary</span>, was born on 6 April 1815 at Chelmsford, Essex, the son of Edward Badger, army sergeant, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1844). He was brought up in Malta, where his father, a regimental schoolmaster, died during his childhood, leaving his education in a rudimentary state. His fluency in Maltese, however, laid the foundation of his later mastery of Arabic. From 1834 he worked successively for the Methodist, American protestant, and Anglican missions in Malta as teacher, Arabic typographer, and translator. At the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) press in Beirut in 1835&#150;6 he improved his knowledge of Arabic. He travelled in Palestine, Syria, and Turkey. After returning to Malta he worked at the Church Missionary Society (CMS) press with Faris al-Shidyaq, preparing Arabic type founts and educational texts for publication; he also wrote an informative and popular guidebook, <span class="italic">Description of Malta and Gozo</span> (1838), which passed into several editions, and more controversial works on press freedom and education in Malta.<br>
<br>In 1840 Badger married Maria Christiana Wilcox (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1866), a missionary schoolmistress. In 1841 he went to London where, after a brief course of study at the CMS college in Islington, he was ordained priest in 1842, having abandoned evangelical protestantism in favour of Anglo-Catholicism under the influence of William Palmer. From 1842 to 1844 he served as an emissary of the bishop of London and the archbishop of Canterbury to the &#145;Nestorian&#146; Church of the East in Kurdistan. He caused controversy there by his campaign against the American protestant mission. He was also accused of advising the patriarch to assert his independence from the local Kurdish ruler, advice which A. H. Layard and others blamed for the Kurdish massacre of Christians in 1843. It was partly to allay such criticism that Badger wrote <span class="italic">The Nestorians and their Rituals</span> (1852), after a return visit to the area in 1850. This is both an informative travelogue and a sourcebook for &#145;Nestorian&#146; history, doctrine, and ritual. Badger was not, however, a Syriac scholar, and in this and later publications (1869 and 1875) he relied on Arabic renderings.<br>
<br>Between 1845 and 1862 Badger was a chaplain in the diocese of Bombay, serving mostly in Aden, where from 1854 he played a key role in British dealings with the local Arab tribes. There he made the acquaintance of Anna Harriette Edwards [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40889/', "Leonowens, Anna Harriette")</script>]. In 1856&#150;7 he accompanied the campaign of General Sir James Outram in Persia, and in 1860 he served on the commission sent to Oman, which brought about the secession of Zanzibar. The Omani ruler Sayyid Thuwayni gave him the manuscript of Salil b. Raziq's chronicle, which he later translated and published as the <span class="italic">History of the Im&acirc;ms and Seyyids of &#146;Om&acirc;n</span> (1871); his notes in particular proved of lasting value. In 1861&#150;2 he visited Egypt for Outram, and conducted a survey of military installations and of the Suez Canal works.<br>
<br>Two more diplomatic missions took Badger to Zanzibar, in 1872 and 1878, the latter apparently as a double agent for Lord Salisbury, who, probably fearing that commercial involvement in east Africa would precipitate entanglement of the British government in the affairs of the mainland, sought to undermine the efforts of British entrepreneurs to win concessions. Otherwise he devoted the rest of his life (from 1862 to 1888) mainly to scholarship. His major work, the <span class="italic">English&#150;Arabic Lexicon</span> (1881), had been started with Faris al-Shidyaq in Malta some forty years earlier. It was reprinted in 1967 and is still sometimes used, despite its obsolescence. Other works include books and articles on Christianity and Islam (notably a defence of the Ottoman caliphate), a translation from Italian of Varthema's sixteenth-century <span class="italic">Travels</span> (1863) with notes drawing on Arabic sources, and a catalogue of the Islamic manuscripts of Fredrick Ayrton, as well as several reports in connection with his diplomatic and military activities. Badger was awarded the degree of DCL by the archbishop of Canterbury in 1873.<br>
<br>Badger's first wife died in 1866, and in 1871 he married Elizabeth Ann Talbot (1834&#150;1897), his housekeeper. Her Somerset connections led to a friendship with the Allen family of West Bradley, and especially with Annie Allen (1858&#150;1930s), forty-three years his junior, with whom he had an intense <i>amiti&eacute; amoureuse</i>. He bequeathed to her a fine oil portrait, revealing a striking, handsome, full-bearded, and full-bodied gentleman, wearing his 1857 war medal and others awarded by the king of Italy (1873) and the sultan of Zanzibar (1880). Badger died on 21 February 1888 at 21 Leamington Road Villas, Westbourne Park, London, his residence for nearly twenty years. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on the 25th.<br>
