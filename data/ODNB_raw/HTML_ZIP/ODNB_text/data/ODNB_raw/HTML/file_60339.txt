<span class="headword">Heuston,  Robert Francis Vere</span>  (1923&#150;1995), <span class="occ">jurist and biographer</span>, was born on 17 November 1923 in Dublin, the elder son of Vere Douglas Heuston, managing clerk at Guinness's brewery in that city, and his wife, Dorothy Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coulter. He was baptized into the Church of Ireland, of which he was throughout his life a communicant member. He was a collateral descendant (and proud to be so) of Robert Emmett, the Irish protestant patriot, executed in 1803 for leading an unsuccessful rebellion against the British, and famed among his countrymen for his defiant speech from the dock. After schooling at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, Heuston read law at Trinity College, Dublin (1941&#150;6), gaining first-class honours, and being auditor (president) of the Historical Society (the student debating society) in 1945. Called to the bar by King's Inns, Dublin (1947), but deciding on an academic career he, like many similarly minded Trinity graduates, went as a research student to St John's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Heuston left Cambridge within a year on his election in 1947, at the age of twenty-three, as Pembroke College, Oxford's first law fellow. Then one of the university's smallest, poorest, and least distinguished colleges, little had changed at Pembroke since the nineteenth century&#151;as John Betjeman observed in &#145;The Death of Dr. Ramsden&#146; (1947). Old men dominated, while a tiny group of middle-aged and young fellows, led by R. B. McCallum, did the work. This atmosphere (not unlike that of the Trinity he had left) was quite congenial to Heuston who&#151;shy, reserved, and fastidious, but far from unsocial&#151;valued formality. He remained at Pembroke for eighteen years, living in college for fifteen of them as a bachelor don responsible for student discipline as well as for teaching law. He was an austere but caring tutor. His pupils included a future lord chief justice of Northern Ireland (Robert Carswell) and a future attorney-general of the Republic of Ireland (J. M. Kelly, whose pioneering study <span class="italic">The Irish Constitution</span> (1963) was begun under Heuston's supervision). During these years the college prospered, and he did most of the writing on which his reputation within both the practising and the academic legal communities was based.<br>
<br>An elegant lecturer, Heuston brought an Irish perspective to constitutional law (his lectures published as <span class="italic">Essays in Constitutional Law</span>, 1961, remained in print until 1997). He then turned to torts, the law governing entitlement to compensation for injuries to person, property, business interests, or reputation wrongfully caused, or, in some circumstances, not prevented&#151;an area of law based almost entirely on judicial decisions rather than legislation. This shift of interest resulted from his undertaking (on the recommendation of the influential A. L. Goodhart) the editing (that is, the keeping up to date) of the classic textbook <span class="italic">Salmond on Torts</span> (first published in 1907 by Sir John Salmond, a New Zealand judge) when its previous editor (and Oxford's vice-chancellor), W. T. S. Stallybrass, had died in an accident. This book, giving an accurate and clear account of the rules the courts were applying, was much relied on throughout the Commonwealth by practitioners and judges as well as by students. Heuston's eminently judicious editing, grounded in his deep respect for the collective wisdom (or common sense) of the judiciary, extended over eleven editions from 1953 to 1996 (from 1987 with R. A. Buckley). During this period the book was reshaped and largely rewritten, and maintained its authoritative status. Footnotes frequently indicated that a passage had been endorsed by a named court or judge. This was traditional legal scholarship, concerned with what judges said rather than with the consequences and desirability of what they did; while still valued by the practising profession, it came even in Heuston's lifetime to seem somewhat old-fashioned. Although a member both of the English Law Reform Committee (1968&#150;70) and the Irish Law Reform Commission (1975&#150;81), his instincts were not those of the law reformer.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Lives of the Lord Chancellors, 1885&#150;1940</span> (1964), Heuston's interests in political and constitutional history and his fascination with the English judiciary were combined. Designed as a continuation of J. B. Atlay's account of the Victorian holders of this hybrid (part political, part judicial) office, which had in its turn continued Lord Campbell's notorious volumes, it included important reassessments of, among others, lords Halsbury, Sankey, and (in a second, less satisfactory, volume, published in 1987 and covering the years 1940&#150;70) Jowitt. Its publication made him a natural choice as the memoirist of twentieth-century judges, both in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Widely regarded as the obvious candidate when the All Souls readership in English law became vacant in 1959, Heuston was, perhaps for this very reason, passed over. Three influences help to explain his move to a professorship at Southampton in 1965: this disappointment; a feeling that he should play his part in the great expansion of English universities and their law faculties then taking place; and his marriage. On 2 July 1962 he married Bridget Nancy Ward-Perkins, daughter of Bernard Godfrey Clarke Bolland, Egyptian government official, and widow of his close friend and colleague at Pembroke, the economist Neville Ward-Perkins, thereby assuming a stepfather's responsibilities for four children.<br>
<br>Heuston returned to Trinity College, Dublin, as regius professor of laws in 1970. This Irish university, by now burgeoning, was very different from the Anglo-Irish protestant college he had left a quarter of a century earlier. Administrative responsibilities, controversies about the reorganization of legal education in Dublin, internal wranglings, and a certain lack of sympathy for his values and standards among younger colleagues (who included two future presidents of Ireland, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, and South Africa's first post-apartheid minister of education, Kader Asmal) made his tenure of the chair less happy and fruitful than had been hoped. On reaching sixty he opted for early retirement.<br>
<br>Heuston was a visiting professor at the University of Melbourne (1956), the University of British Columbia (1960 and 1985), and the Australian National University (1977), Gresham professor in law (1964&#150;70), and Arthur Goodhart professor of legal science at Cambridge (1986&#150;7). He was made an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford (1982), an honorary bencher of King's Inns, Dublin (1983), and Gray's Inn, London (1988), a corresponding fellow of the British Academy (1993), and a QC <i>honoris causa</i> (1995). He enjoyed the English and the Irish countryside, visits to places with historical and legal associations, race meetings, and dining clubs. He kept his many English friendships in good repair, and his conversation, like his lectures and his writings, was enriched with anecdotes harvested from a wide reading of political memoirs and diaries. He died of cancer at Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin, on 21 December 1995, and was buried on 31 December at St Patrick's, Tara, Meath. He was survived by his wife and four stepchildren.<br>
