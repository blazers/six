<span class="headword">Mills,  William Hobson</span>  (1873&#150;1959), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born in London on 6 July 1873, the eldest of the five children of William Henry Mills, a Lincolnshire architect, and his wife, Emily Wiles Quincey, daughter of William Hobson, of Spalding, Lincolnshire. Mills's parents returned to Spalding in the autumn of 1873. He was educated at Spalding grammar school and Uppingham School, and entered Jesus College, Cambridge, in October 1892, but spent the academic year 1893&#150;4 at home recovering from a foot injury received at school. He obtained a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1896 and in part two (chemistry) in 1897. In 1899 he was elected to a prize fellowship of his college and went to work for two years under Hans von Pechmann at T&uuml;bingen, where he was awarded his doctorate. In the T&uuml;bingen laboratory he met N. V. Sidgwick of Oxford, who became his lifelong friend. They shared a deep interest in both chemistry and natural history.<br>
<br>In 1902 Mills became head of the chemical department of the Northern Polytechnic Institute in London. On 11 August 1903 he married <a href="#cosubject_56149">Mildred May Gostling [<i>see below</i>]</a>, chemist; they had one son and three daughters. In 1912 he returned to Cambridge to become demonstrator to the Jacksonian professor of natural philosophy, Sir James Dewar. (He succeeded H. O. Jones, who had been killed while climbing in the Alps.) Mills was also elected a fellow and lecturer of Jesus College. He was appointed a university lecturer in organic chemistry in 1919, and reader in stereochemistry in 1931, an appointment from which he retired in 1938. In 1940&#150;48 he was president of Jesus College.<br>
<br>Mills's researches can be classified as relating almost entirely to two main topics, stereochemistry and the cyanine dyes, in each of which he attained an outstanding position. The Cambridge school of stereochemistry had been founded by H. O. Jones and greatly developed by W. J. Pope, but its greatest achievements were due to Mills and his co-workers, whose most important investigations were as follows: the first experimental confirmation of the Hantzsch&#150;Werner theory of the isomerism of oximes; the first optical resolution of a spirocyclic compound and of an allene compound; the confirmation of the tetrahedral configuration of quaternary ammonium ions and of the planar configuration of platinous complexes; and the development of the &#145;obstacle&#146; theory, involving restricted rotation, to explain the optical isomerism of certain substituted diphenic acids. Mills synthesized and resolved several novel types of compounds, the optical activity of which was dependent on restricted rotation.<br>
<br>Mills's work on cyanine dyes began early in the First World War. German photographic reconnaissance was carried out using plates which, by the addition of minute quantities of certain highly coloured compounds, had been &#145;sensitized&#146; throughout the violet-blue-red regions, whereas the allies were initially using plates which were not sensitive in the red region and thus gave particularly poor results in early morning light. Pope and Mills investigated the preparation and chemistry of these &#145;photographic sensitizers&#146;, with the result that nearly all the dyestuffs used by the allies in the manufacture of panchromatic plates were produced in the Cambridge laboratory. Mills later greatly extended the knowledge of cyanine dyes.<br>
<br>Mills was elected FRS in 1923 and received the Davy medal in 1933. He received the Longstaff medal of the Chemical Society in 1930, and was president of the society in 1941&#150;4. He was president of the chemistry section at the British Association meeting in 1932. In 1937 he was George Fisher Baker lecturer at Cornell University, but contrary to tradition he did not publish the lectures.<br>
<br>Mills was an accomplished field botanist and ornithologist. After his retirement he spent much time studying the sub-species of British bramble, which he collected, classified, and finally preserved in the botany department at Cambridge.<br>

<a name="cosubject_56149"></a><span class="headword">Mildred May Gostling</span>  (1873&#150;1962), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 15 December 1873, the daughter of George James Gostling, a dental surgeon and pharmaceutical chemist, and his wife, Sarah Abicail Aldrich. She was educated at Bedford College and Royal Holloway College, London, and was Bathurst student and assistant in the chemistry laboratory at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1898&#150;1900. Later (1901&#150;2) she was demonstrator in chemistry at Royal Holloway College. At Cambridge she carried out research in organic chemistry in association with H. J. H. Fenton in the university laboratories. She published five papers, four of them in association with Fenton. Most of her research work was carried out before her marriage to Mills.<br>
<br>Mills died at his home, 23 Storeys Way, Cambridge, on 22 February 1959; his wife died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 19 February 1962.<br>
