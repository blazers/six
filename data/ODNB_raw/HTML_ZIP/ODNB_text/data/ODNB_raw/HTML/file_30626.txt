<span class="headword">Bartlet,  James Vernon</span>  (1863&#150;1940), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born on 15 August 1863 in Scarborough, the only son of George Donald Bartlet (1823&#150;1906), an English Presbyterian minister who was also a schoolmaster in Scarborough and in London, and his wife, Susan Robe McNellan, formerly of Alloa, near Stirling. He was educated at his father's private school in Highgate and at Highgate School, from where he proceeded in 1882 with a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford. He obtained a first class in classical moderations (1883), a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1886), and a first class in theology (1887). He won the senior Hall-Houghton Greek Testament prize in 1889. In that year he was appointed tutor and the first librarian at the newly established Mansfield College, Oxford, which he had entered in 1887 and where he studied under Andrew Martin Fairbairn. He remained at Mansfield until his retirement in 1928, being senior resident tutor from 1890 to 1900 and thereafter &#145;professor&#146; of church history. He received the honorary degree of DD from St Andrews University in 1904.<br>
<br>Bartlet's upbringing was narrow and ultra-orthodox, but he was too good a scholar and had too great an integrity of intellect to be able to remain within its confines; not without personal struggle, he won through to a broader outlook. At Oxford he was greatly influenced by Edwin Hatch and by William Sanday, of whose <span class="roman">New Testament</span> seminar he was a valued member.<br>
<br>In 1900 Bartlet married Mary Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;1904), daughter of Robert Edward Gibson, surgeon, of Norwich, with whom he had two sons. In 1904 Elizabeth Bartlet died, shortly preceded by her younger son. In 1906 Bartlet married Sarah, daughter of James Burgess, Congregational minister, of Little Baddow, Essex. She outlived her husband.<br>
<br>As a scholar, Bartlet's chief work was in <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies, and early church history, and he was recognized as one of the leading Oxford scholars in these fields. In 1900 he published <span class="italic">The Apostolic Age: its Life, Doctrine, Worship and Polity</span>. This was followed by two commentaries, <span class="italic">The Acts</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">St Mark</span> (1922), in the <span class="roman">Century Bible</span> series. His Birkbeck lectures, delivered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1924, were edited by Cecil John Cadoux, his former student, and published posthumously (1943) as <span class="italic">Church-Life and Church-Order during the First Four Centuries</span>. He was a frequent contributor to symposia, encyclopaedias, and theological journals, his work always being marked by careful learning and a meticulous desire for accuracy. His presentation was strictly historical in its perspectives, never allowing finality to the terms or thought forms which they represented. This approach was developed through his membership of the Oxford Society of Historical Theology, of which he was secretary from 1894 to 1936, and found particular expression in the chapters which he contributed to <span class="italic">Christianity in History: a Study of Religious Development</span> (1917), a work produced in collaboration with Alexander James Carlyle.<br>
<br>Keenly interested in Christian reunion, and always eirenic in temper, Bartlet believed that the path to church unity lay through an &#145;objective&#146; study of church history. He was a founder member of the Free Church Fellowship, and had a wide circle of friends in many denominations. He took a prominent part in the Conference on Christian Politics, Economics and Citizenship (COPEC) in 1924 and in the World Conference on Faith and Order held at Lausanne in 1927. Although never ordained, he was regarded as a leading figure in the Congregational churches. Tall and dignified in bearing, and delicate in health, he was a vehement teetotaller and non-smoker. His personal influence on generations of students was profound, despite strangely convoluted forms of speech and writing. His gentleness, sincerity, and deep devotion won the affection of all.<br>
<br>Bartlet died at his home, 35 Museum Road, Oxford, on 5 August 1940. His funeral service was held in Mansfield College chapel, and he was buried on 8 August in Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, next to his parents and his first wife.<br>
