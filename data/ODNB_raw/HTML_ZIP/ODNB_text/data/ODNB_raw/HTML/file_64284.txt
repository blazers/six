<span class="headword">Slack,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>S. Thomas]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was the eldest son of Joseph Slack (1701&#150;1752?), of Wreay, near Carlisle, and his wife Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stephenson); he was baptized on 18 December 1723 at Hesket in the Forest, Cumberland. Nothing is known of Slack's education and early years. On 15 December 1751 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45847/', "Ann (or Anne) Fisher (1719&#150;1778)")</script>, daughter of Henry Fisher, a yeoman of Oldscale, in the parish of Lorton, Cumberland. On 18 October 1752 Thomas Slack, as the heir of his father, was admitted tenant of lands at Wreay which, on 16 September 1784, his eldest daughter and heir-at-law, Mrs Mary Blaylock, inherited.<br>
<br>By 1751 Slack was working for the Quaker printer Isaac Thompson, of Newcastle, to whom William Bulmer was later apprenticed. Thompson was proprietor of the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>, and Slack was said to have been his manager. Their working relationship is unclear, however, for in 1755 was issued <span class="italic">Lucius and Celadon, or, A Dialogue of the Existence and Immortality of the Soul</span>, with the imprint &#145;Printed by I. Thompson and C&deg;, for Tho. Slack&#146;; in the following year <span class="italic">The Newcastle Memorandum-Book</span> was published with the imprint &#145;Printed for Tho. Slack, and sold by all Persons who distribute the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span>&#146;. The <span class="italic">Memorandum Book</span> survived as an annual publication until 1893, and was widely sold by booksellers in England and Scotland; Charles Elliot, the Edinburgh publisher and bookseller, for example, took 100 copies in 1774. In association with the London publishers, George Robinson &amp; Co., he also published <span class="italic">The Ladies' Own Memorandum-Book</span>, prepared by his wife; Slack printed the letterpress matter, and the Robinsons dealt with the calendar and ruled matter. This publication continued under his successors until 1805, when the Robinsons failed.<br>
<br>In 1763 Slack started his own printing business, following a disagreement with Isaac Thompson, reflected in correspondence in the local news-sheets. His shop which he named the Printing Press, was at the head of Middle Street, Newcastle upon Tyne. Slack, ably assisted by his wife, sold prints, lottery tickets, and spectacles, in addition to books and stationery. The printing of books formed a large part of their flourishing business. Between 1755 and 1784 his name appeared, as printer, publisher, or bookseller in the imprints of some 150 books, including two editions of <span class="italic">The Pleasing Instructor</span> (1756) by his wife, writing under her maiden name. Among other books by his wife, of which Thomas Slack printed and published several editions, were <span class="italic">A Practical New Grammar</span> (1762), <span class="italic">A New English Exercise Book</span> (1770), <span class="italic">An Accurate New Spelling Dictionary</span> (3rd edn, 1777), and <span class="italic">The New English Tutor</span> (1778). An advertisement in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span> for 16 March 1782 shows that he also published the pastoral poems of John Cunningham, poet and player.<br>
<br>In competition with Thompson's <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span> he established the weekly <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, the first issue appearing on 24 March 1764. The newspaper remained in the control of his daughter and son-in-law and their sons until 1850. When Joseph Cowen, industrialist and MP, took it over from Mark William Lambert in 1859 it became a radical campaigning journal; it ceased publication in 1953.<br>
<br>Thomas Slack was also an author, writing under the pseudonym S. Thomas, complementing his wife's work with a series of books on business practice: <span class="italic">The British Negociator</span> (1759), <span class="italic">The Banker's Sure Guide</span> (1762), <span class="italic">Britannicus estimator</span> (1764), which became <span class="italic">The Ready Calculator</span> (1771), and <span class="italic">The Commercial Palladium</span> (1775). He also edited W. Webster's <span class="italic">Essays on Book-Keeping (1779)</span>.<br>
<br>Among Slack's competitors in the Newcastle book trade were John White (<i>fl</i>. 1711&#150;1769), William Charnley (<i>fl</i>. 1755&#150;1803), and Thomas Saint (<i>fl</i>. 1761&#150;1788), who worked with and succeeded White. White was the first &#145;permanent&#146; printer in Newcastle and, in 1711, established the <span class="italic">Newcastle Courant</span>, which Saint continued. Saint pursued White's policy of concentrating on popular literature, including children's books, often illustrated by Thomas Bewick. Charnley was a considerable bookseller and publisher, helping to establish Fourstones papermill in 1763. Each of these four had, therefore, his own field of specialization, Slack concentrating on more substantial, frequently didactic, works, and all had connections with the London and provincial book trade. Ann Fisher's schoolbooks were frequently reprinted in association with Slack and &#145;pirated&#146; by Hoey of Dublin, Henry Mozley of Gainsborough, Christopher Etherington of York, and Anthony Soulby of Penrith, among others.<br>
<br>Slack was unusual in the eighteenth-century English provincial book trade in combining authorship (his and his wife's), printing and publishing a wide range of books, newspaper proprietorship, and jobbing printing. In this he was most successful, his will showing that in addition to the property at Wreay and his house and printing workshop in Middle Street, he had other houses and a shop in Newcastle and a one-sixteenth share in the ship <i>Mary</i>.<br>
<br>Slack and Fisher had nine children, all girls, three of whom died in infancy; one other, Jane, predeceased her father, dying in 1776, aged twenty-one. Thomas Slack died at Newcastle on 13 January 1784, and was buried at St John's Church there. The printing business was left to his fourth daughter, Sarah, then aged just under twenty-four. Solomon Hodgson (1760&#150;1800), who had probably been working for Slack, married Sarah on 15 February 1785. On 21 February the executors of Thomas Slack's estate transferred to Hodgson the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, together with the printing, bookselling, and stationery business.<br>
