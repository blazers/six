<span class="headword">Gunton,  Colin Ewart</span>  (1941&#150;2003), <span class="occ">theologian and United Reformed minister</span>, was born on 19 January 1941 at 32 Lexden Road, Colchester, Essex, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Ewart Gunton (1907&#150;2000), local government officer, and his wife, Mabel Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradley (<i>b</i>. 1916). At the time of his birth his parents lived at 102 Maldon Road, Colchester. The family moved in 1946 to Nottingham, where Gunton was educated at Nottingham high school. In 1960 he won a classics scholarship to Hertford College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1964. On 8 August the same year he married Jennifer Mary (Jenny) Osgathorpe, a 24-year-old schoolteacher who lived in Nottingham, where they were members of the same church; she was the daughter of Albert William Osgathorpe, an insurance claims assessor. They had two daughters, Sarah and Carolyn, and two sons, Christopher and Jonathan.<br>
<br>From Hertford College Gunton moved to Mansfield College, Oxford, to study theology; he graduated with a congratulatory first in 1966, and obtained his MA in 1967, and his DPhil in 1973. His doctoral thesis, on the relationship between the process philosopher Charles Hartshorne and the Reformed theologian Karl Barth, was supervised first by Robert Jenson, then by John Marsh, and finally by John Macquarrie. His formative influences in theology also included George Caird, and Reformed figures such as John Calvin, P. T. Forsyth, T. F. Torrance, and Karl Barth. Throughout his career, Gunton similarly pursued his theology in an unremittingly Christocentric and Trinitarian way, always seeing the discipline as a task of the church. He was deeply committed to systematic theology as a constructive and exegetical discipline, and to working out his theology in dialogue with, but not in subservience to, modern patterns of thought.<br>
<br>In 1969 Gunton was appointed lecturer in the philosophy of religion at King's College, London, becoming lecturer in systematic theology in 1980, senior lecturer in 1983, and professor of Christian doctrine in 1984. In subsequent years he was both dean of the faculty of theology and religious studies (1988&#150;90) and head of the department of theology and religious studies (1993&#150;6). His election as a fellow of King's College in 2003 proceeded posthumously. He was made a DD by the University of London in 1993, and an honorary DD by the University of Aberdeen in 1999. At the time of his death he had also been granted leave to supplicate for the degree of DD by the University of Oxford. During his time at King's College, the department developed from being a training house for Anglican ordinands to being a non-denominational, theologically and internationally diverse centre for theological enquiry.<br>
<br>Gunton's doctoral thesis was published as <span class="italic">Becoming and Being</span> in 1978, and a series of further theological monographs, journal articles, and edited volumes followed. Among his most important works were <span class="italic">Yesterday and Today</span> (1983), <span class="italic">The Actuality of Atonement</span> (1989), <span class="italic">The Promise of Trinitarian Theology</span> (1991), and <span class="italic">Theology through the Theologians</span> (1996). He was invited to give the Bampton lectures at the University of Oxford in 1992 which led to the acclaimed <span class="italic">The One, the Three and the Many</span> (1993), and the Warfield lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1993, from which came <span class="italic">A Brief Theology of Revelation</span> (1995). One of his last published works, <span class="italic">The Christian Faith: an Introduction to Christian Doctrine</span> (2001), was to have prepared the way for his projected multi-volume work on Christian dogmatics.<br>
<br>Professionally, Gunton was involved in the Society for the Study of Theology (SST) throughout his career, serving as its secretary (1977&#150;87) and president (1993&#150;4). For many years, he was one of a small group&#151;along with Daniel W. Hardy and others&#151;who led the development of the SST, by organizing its meetings, shaping its agendas, and overseeing its growth. In 1999 he co-founded with John Webster the <span class="italic">International Journal of Systematic Theology</span>, on whose editorial team he served until his death, and he also served as editor of the <span class="italic">King's Theological Review</span>.<br>
<br>Gunton was the second minister ordained into the newly formed United Reformed church in 1972. From 1975 until his death he served as associate minister of Brentwood United Reformed Church, Essex, having moved to Brentwood with his wife in 1972. Between 1985 and 1991 he was convenor of the doctrine and worship committee of the United Reformed church. In 2001 a volume of his sermons was published as <span class="italic">Theology through Preaching: Sermons for Brentwood</span>, with a second volume also planned. For Gunton the church was no merely academic object of study: it was primarily the place for the living out of his Christian conviction and commitment.<br>
<br>Gunton was a man of profound faith who embodied a real zest for life and a constant sense of cheerfulness. An inspirational and impassioned teacher and preacher, his joy and interest in theology were infectious and deeply appreciated by students, colleagues, and parishioners alike. He was also a devoted family man and a loyal friend, who relaxed in the pursuit of gardening, walking, and choral singing. His legacy lay not only in his accomplished academic work, but in the many who were touched by his enthusiasm and his witness. It was a great shock both to his family and his colleagues when Gunton was pronounced dead on arrival at Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, on 6 May 2003, having suffered a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage and a bleeding gastric ulcer. He was survived by his wife, Jenny, and their four children.<br>
