<span class="headword">Prujean, Sir  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the eldest of at least four children of the Revd Francis Prujean (<i>d</i>. 1624), curate of Widford by Chelmsford, Essex, in 1596, and rector of Boothby, Lincolnshire, from 1596 to 1622, and his first wife. The younger Prujean was baptized at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 21 February 1597, and educated at home by his father. He matriculated in 1610 as a sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, his father's former college. The family seems to have been under some financial constraints, as Prujean's father took out three episcopal licences in 1605: to teach as a schoolmaster; to preach; and to practise medicine. He was, in addition, a writing clerk and notary. Some of the financial burden was eased in 1613, when Francis gained a scholarship at Caius. Prujean gained his BA in 1614 and MA in 1617. By 22 December 1621 he was a licentiate of the College of Physicians, but his movements between 1617 and 1621 are unclear. He met and married Margaret Legatt (<i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of Thomas Legatt of Hornchurch, Essex, probably towards the end of this period; they had a son, Thomas (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1662). Prujean may possibly have still been at Cambridge at the time of his marriage, as he received a grace for an MD in 1621, though he did not receive the degree until 1625. The puritan John Gee suggested in 1624 that popish sympathies caused this delay.<br>
<br>Prujean was clearly in London, practising medicine, from 1621 to 1626, when he was elected to a fellowship in the College of Physicians. Soon after his election he returned to Lincolnshire, where he practised until 1638, gaining a great reputation among his patients.<br>
<br>In 1639 Prujean returned to London, took up residence in the parish of St Martin Ludgate and was elected censor at the College of Physicians. He was re-elected in 1642 and held the office until 1647, also serving as college registrar from 1641 to 1647. A stalwart of the college, Prujean was its president from 1650 to 1653. In 1654 the college elected William Harvey president, but he declined and Prujean was re-elected on Harvey's recommendation. It was through Prujean in 1651 that Harvey first conveyed a proposal to build a library for the college; it was finally completed and opened on 2 February 1654, the last year of Prujean's presidency. Prujean continued to serve the college as its treasurer from 1655 to 1663, and as consiliarius from 1656 to his death in 1666. He was knighted by Charles II on 1 April 1661 and was credited with curing his queen of typhus in 1663.<br>
<br>Prujean was a man of many talents and interests. John Evelyn described a visit to Prujean's London home on 9 August 1661:<blockquote>I went to that famous Physitian Sir Fr: Prujean who showed me his Laboratorie, his other Workhouse for turning and other Mechanics, also many excellent Pictures, especially the Magdalen of Carrachio: some incomparable paisages don in distemper: He plaied to me likewise on the Polyphone, an instrument having something of the Harp, Lute, Theorb &amp; c: it was a sweete Instrument, by none known in England, or described by any Author, nor used but by this skillful &amp; learned Doctor. (Evelyn, 294)</blockquote>It was perhaps Prujean's talent, tastes, and keen appreciation of art and beauty that led to recurring suspicions that he was a papist. In 1643 his house in London was ransacked, with a loss of goods valued at &pound;500. In 1658 he was brought before a London quarter session court, charged that he was &#145;a Papist or popishly affected&#146;, a charge he repeatedly denied.<br>
<br>Prujean married for a second time on 13 February 1664. His second wife, also named Margaret, was the widow of Sir Thomas Fleming and the wealthy daughter of Edward, Lord Gorges. Prujean died in London on 23 June 1666 and was buried with his first wife and son at Hornchurch, Essex. Samuel Pepys noted his death in his diary:<blockquote>Sir Francis Prujean is dead, after being married to a widow about a year or thereabouts. He died very rich, and had, for the last yeare lived very handsomely, his lady bringing him to it. He was no great painstaker in person, yet died very rich; and, as Dr. Clerke says, was of very great judgment, but hath writ nothing to leave his name to posterity. (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 318&#150;19)</blockquote>In accordance with Prujean's wishes, Baldwin Hamey composed an epitaph for Prujean, his wife, and son. Prujean disbursed a great deal of money in his will and named his grandson, Robert, as his principal heir  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/321/122). Prujean's home was near the Old Bailey, and the place where he lived was named after him Prujean Square.<br>
