<span class="headword">Topham,  John</span>  (1746&#150;1803), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 6 January 1746 at Emley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third son of Matthew Topham (<i>d</i>. 1773), vicar of Withernwick and Mappleton, in Holderness, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Henry Willcock of Thornton in Craven. He spent his childhood at Malton, in the East Riding. His father was the fifth son of Christopher Topham of Caldbergh and Withernwick, and was probably able to use family connections to secure a post for John under Philip Carteret Webb, then joint solicitor to the treasury. Webb, a busy and often unpopular politician, was also a prominent and influential member of the Society of Antiquaries. He thought well of John, who was inclined to historical studies, and found him a place in the state paper office under Sir Joseph Ayloffe and Thomas Astle, later the keeper of records in the Tower of London.<br>
<br>Webb was keenly interested in the ordering and preservation of the public records, and particularly at that time in printing the parliament rolls, the records of parliament in the middle ages from 1278 to 1503. He may well have introduced Topham to the state paper office to further his campaign. Topham was certainly engaged in the work from its inception in 1767 (when he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries) to the completion, printing, and distribution of the six folio volumes of <span class="italic">Rotuli parliamentorum</span> in 1776&#150;7. Together with Astle and Philip Morant he was responsible for a remarkably successful edition of a forbidding mass of parchment.<br>
<br>Topham was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn in 1771, and in April 1779 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In May 1781, having served as secretary to the commission reviewing the records, he was appointed a deputy keeper of the state papers. A year later the papers became a historic archive when responsibility for foreign and home affairs was formally divided between the two secretaries of state, and the new Foreign and Home offices&#151;the first modern departments of government&#151;began to keep their own records. In 1771 Topham was made a commissioner in bankruptcy and in 1787 he became a bencher of Gray's Inn; in 1788 he was treasurer of the Society of Antiquaries for the second time, having served briefly in 1783&#150;4. He was not a prudent treasurer, yet regularly attended the committee meetings of the society. He also acted as registrar to a charity for the relief of poor widows and children of the clergy, and was treasurer of the orphan charity school. In 1790 he was appointed librarian to the archbishop of Canterbury, in succession to Michael Lort, canon prebendary of Tottenham in St Paul's.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1794 Topham married Mary, daughter and coheir of Samuel Francis Swinden (<i>d</i>. 1764) of Wimpole Street, London, and Greenwich. Besides his official duties and charitable work he pursued his own studies, contributing a series of papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> and editing texts, including Francis Gregor's translation of Sir John Fortescue's <span class="italic">De laudibus legum Angliae</span> (1775) and, with Richard Blyke, Sir John Glanvill's <span class="italic">Reports of certain cases determined in parliament in the twenty-first and twenty-second years of James I</span>. He added a historical preface to that volume on the law and practice of determining disputed elections. He also published the daybook of the comptroller of the wardrobe in Edward I's reign, <span class="italic">Liber quotidianus contrarotulatoris garderobae, AD 1299&#150;1300</span> (1787), with a useful introduction.<br>
<br>Topham died at Cheltenham on 19 August 1803 and was buried in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral; there is a memorial tablet to him on the wall of the north aisle. His marriage was childless, and his books and collections were sold in 1804. The British Museum acquired numbers of his manuscripts, now in the British Library, including more than fifty volumes of deeds known as the Topham charters, relating to English monastic houses. Topham was learned in the law, and in the middle ages at large, but his chief contribution to scholarship was his work on the rolls of parliament, which served the most rigorous purposes of historical enquiry for more than two centuries.<br>
