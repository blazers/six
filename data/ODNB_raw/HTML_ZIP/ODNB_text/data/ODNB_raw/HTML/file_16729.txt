<span class="headword">Lingen, Sir  Henry</span>  (1612&#150;1661/2), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, born at Rotherwas, near Hereford, on 23 October 1612, was the eldest son of Edward Lingen (<i>d</i>. 1635), of Freen's Court, in the parish of Sutton St Michael, Herefordshire, and his wife, Blanch Bodenham, daughter of Sir Roger Bodenham of Rotherwas. Lingen's father was twice imprisoned by the council in the marches&#151;once for refusing to pay alimony to his estranged wife and then on the grounds of insanity&#151;but he was restored to his property by the privy council. Edward Lingen was a Catholic, but Henry was brought up an Anglican by John Scudamore, first Viscount Scudamore. On 3 April 1626 he married Alice Pye (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Sir Walter Pye of the Mynde, Herefordshire, who brought with her a marriage portion of &pound;1000. They had eight daughters and one son, Henry, who was to outlive his father but died a minor in 1670. In 1635 Lingen inherited large estates from his father in Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Gloucestershire. In 1638 he was appointed sheriff of Herefordshire and reported to the privy council the opposition in the county to ship money.<br>
<br>In April 1642 Lingen was one of the Herefordshire justices who signed a letter defending the Church of England, directed to the county's MPs, declaring their resistance to parliament's orders because they were not sanctioned by the king. In 1643 he was again sheriff and in June he was one of the commissioners of array ordered by the king to assist the local commander, Sir William Vavasour, in raising forces in Herefordshire. He had soon collected 1200 foot and 200 horse and had agreed to raise &pound;1200 per month from the county in local taxes. In July 1643 with Vavasour he was engaged in the siege of Brampton Bryan Castle, Herefordshire, held by Lady Brilliana Harley, and he took sole command when Vavasour was summoned to the siege of Gloucester. News of the royalist defeat there and a lack of ordnance compelled Lingen to raise the siege and he retired to Knighton where he was attacked by Lady Brilliana's forces. Subsequently he withdrew to Hereford, which was garrisoned with 700 troops, and occupied the earl of Kent's property, Goodrich Castle, in order to strengthen the line of the Wye against the parliamentarian forces at Gloucester.<br>
<br>Early in 1644 Lingen, with the other senior officers at Hereford, wrote to Prince Rupert, saying that he could no longer serve under Vavasour because his command had been incorrectly drawn up. In December Rupert appointed Barnabus Scudamore governor of Hereford and to consolidate his position made him sheriff in Lingen's place. The &#145;able Lingen&#146; was left in command of Goodrich but he warned Rupert that Herefordshire was &#145;much ruined by plunder and quarter&#146; through the passing of troops from north Wales to Bristol (Hutton, 136; Herefs. RO, M70). In March 1645 Herefordshire was paralysed by the rising of the Clubmen who resisted the demands made upon them by the royalist garrisons. Lingen's home at Freen's Court was attacked and he was forced to promise &pound;1000 in compensation for the injuries he had inflicted on the county. With Rupert's arrival the rising was suppressed.<br>
<br>In July 1645 Lingen was knighted when the king visited Hereford and relieved it of the Scottish siege. Lingen was in Hereford when the city was surprised by Colonel Birch on the morning of 18 December 1645. He escaped across the frozen river and shut himself up in Goodrich Castle with 200 &#145;cavaliers&#146; and &#145;bold riders&#146;  (Hutchinson, 72). Birch was granted a pension of &pound;50 by parliament from Sir Henry's estate. The latter maintained his forces by forcibly requisitioning supplies from his neighbours. During the two years in which Lingen garrisoned Goodrich nearly &pound;300 of damage was done to Kent's estate. Birch made an effort to storm Goodrich Castle on the night of 9 March 1646, but succeeded only in burning down the stables and outhouses. During the temporary absence of Birch, Lingen, with a mere handful of comrades, attempted the recovery of Hereford. Finding little support in the city, he returned to Goodrich which was reinvested by Birch. &#145;The last of the royalist warlords&#146; surrendered on 31 July 1646 only after the walls of the castle had been battered down by a large cannon called Roaring Meg which Birch had had made in the Forest of Dean  (Hutton, 199). According to tradition the garrison marched out to a lively tune called, after their leader, &#145;Sir Harry Lingen's Fancy&#146; or &#145;Delight&#146;, which was &#145;long used in the neighbourhood in the dances of the peasantry&#146;  (Webb, 2.280).<br>
<br>Lingen spent two months in prison at Hereford, but petitioned on 1 October 1646 to compound for his estate, which was valued at &pound;936 per annum. He was still popular in Hereford and when he reappeared in the city&#151;contrary to his parole, wearing his sword&#151;he caused a riot but was considered too dangerous to arrest. In November Lingen was obliged to take the covenant and a few days later the negative oath restraining him from any further attempt against parliament.<br>
<br>In August 1648, with the outbreak of the second civil war, Lingen received a commission from the prince of Wales to foment a rising in Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire. Several strongholds were to have been seized, but the plot was detected by Andrew Yarranton, governor of Hartlebury in Worcestershire, and measures were taken to suppress it. However, Lingen drew together 400 men and surprised a group of horse under Sir Edward Harley near Leominster in September, taking eighty prisoners, but two or three days later he was overthrown between Radnor and Montgomeryshire by the forces of Harley and Sir Richard Hopton, and all the captives were recovered. Lingen himself, seriously wounded, was captured and confined in Powis Castle, Montgomeryshire. The House of Commons ordered him to be banished on 10 November 1648, but the sentence was revoked on 13 December following. He was ultimately obliged to sell a portion of his estates. The fine levied by parliament upon his property amounted to &pound;6350, and it had been heavily taxed by the maintenance of a regiment of horse. Sir Robert Harley was authorized to recompense himself for his losses out of Lingen's property, but through his son Edward he generously returned the schedule, waiving all right or title to the estates which it had conferred upon him.<br>
<br>Lingen retired to Stoke Edith, Herefordshire, which became his principal home. He was elected MP for Hereford on 20 November 1660 and again in April 1661. The second election was subject to an inquiry by the committee on elections and privileges, which quashed it, but Lingen was returned again. He was an inactive MP, but in 1661 was appointed to the committees on bills for confirming public acts and restoring advowsons.<br>
<br>Lingen died of smallpox at Gloucester on his way home from London, and was buried at Stoke Edith on 22 January 1662. In consideration of Lingen's heavy losses his widow was authorized by a royal warrant of November 1663 to receive &pound;10,000, but little of this seems to have materialized. In 1670 Stoke Edith was sold to Paul Foley and the rest of Sir Henry's estate was divided among his daughters and their husbands.<br>
