<span class="headword">Lovegrove,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1816), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of a plumber, was born at Shoreham, Sussex, on 13 January 1778, and was apprenticed to his father. After playing Hamlet as an amateur at a private theatre in Tottenham Court Road, London, he made his first professional appearance at the Richmond theatre in June 1799. From there he went to Dublin, where he appeared as Anhalt in <span class="italic">Lovers' Vows</span>, an adaptation from the German by Elizabeth Inchbald. In a stagecoach on his way to Manchester he was shot in the leg when a passenger's pistol was accidentally discharged. This delayed his arrival, and hampered his eventual performance in the city. After playing in Guernsey and Plymouth he made his first appearance at Bath in November 1802 in the part of Lazarillo in Robert Jephson's farce <span class="italic">Two Strings to your Bow</span>. During the season he played other roles, including Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and gained some popularity. When John Edwin left Bath for Dublin, a large range of comic characters fell to Lovegrove, whose name appeared in Bath and Bristol in roles from Dr Pangloss in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>, Sir Anthony Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, and Isaac in <span class="italic">The Duenna</span>, to Autolycus, Dogberry, Sir Martin Marall, and Alphonse in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span>. During the summer season he played at Margate and Worthing. Bath proved, as it often did, the portal to London, and Lovegrove appeared on 3 October 1810 at the Lyceum, the temporary home of the Drury Lane company, as Lord Ogleby in Colman and Garrick's <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>. Job Thornberry in Colman's <span class="italic">John Bull</span> and many favourite characters followed, and he played original parts in dramas by Dimond, Masters, Millingen, Arnold, and other writers. His Lopez in <span class="italic">Kiss</span>, an alteration of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Spanish Curate</span>, won him much applause.<br>
<br>Lovegrove remained with the company in the new Drury Lane Theatre until his retirement, and rose to be one of the principal supports of the house. He married a Miss Weippert, the daughter of a harp player; she died shortly after giving birth to a daughter, who did not long survive her. These two shocks produced a visible effect on Lovegrove's health. He took a benefit in June 1814, when he appeared as Wilford in Colman's tragedy <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> and played in a piece entitled <span class="italic">Cheating</span>, by a friend named Parry. In October that year he was the original Old Fathom in <span class="italic">Policy, or, Thus Runs the World Away</span>, attributed to Henry Siddons. Soon afterwards he broke a blood vessel and was ill for many months. He did not reappear until June 1815, when for the first time, for his benefit, he played Sir Peter Teazle; his reception was enthusiastic. He acted during the next season and was allowed a full salary until a relapse occurred and his recovery was seen to be hopeless. He was granted a half salary until his death, on 25 June 1816, near Bath, where he had been taken by his sister.<br>
<br>Lovegrove was an excellent actor, and his premature death was a misfortune. A prudent and a reserved man, he mixed little with his colleagues and though much respected had few close friends. He was the victim either of a singular outrage or of an extraordinary delusion. George Raymond, the biographer of R. W. Elliston, records how Lovegrove once rushed to the Lyceum at midnight, covered with brickdust and mortar, and in a state of frenzy, stating that at the end of Dyott Street, Bloomsbury, he had been seized and pinioned by two stalwart women, forced into a house, and thrust into a room, where a third woman was dying from the result of violence. By supreme efforts he escaped. After his recovery he took refuge in customary taciturnity, and no elucidation was afforded of the story. Raymond says that Lovegrove was strong, natural, and free from caricature.<br>
