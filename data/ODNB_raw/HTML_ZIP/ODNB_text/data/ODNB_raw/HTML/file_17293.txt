<span class="headword">Lyons,  Robert Spencer Dyer</span>  (1826&#150;1886), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Glanmire, Cork, the second son of Sir William Lyons (1794&#150;1858), a merchant of the city who was mayor in 1848 and 1849 and was knighted by the queen on her visit to Cork on 3 August 1849. His mother was Harriet, daughter of Robert Spencer Dyer of Kinsale. Robert was educated at Hamblin and Porter's Grammar School, Cork, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated MB in 1848. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1849. In 1855 he was appointed pathologist-in-chief to the army in the Crimea, where he reported on the disease then prevalent in the trenches before Sevastopol (<span class="italic">Report on the Pathology of the Diseases of the Army in the East</span>, 1856). On 8 September 1855 he was awarded the Crimean and Turkish medals and clasps for Sevastopol. Lyons was professor of medicine and pathology in the Catholic University medical school in Dublin, and in 1857 he undertook a voluntary mission to Lisbon to investigate the pathological anatomy of the yellow fever which was raging there, and for his report on that subject received from Dom Pedro V the cross and insignia of the ancient order of Christ. He soon returned to Ireland and joined St George's Hospital, Dublin, where he took an active share in the education of the army medical staff. Lyons was also a senator of the Royal University in 1880, crown nominee for Ireland in the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom on 29 November 1881, physician to the House of Industry hospitals, and visiting physician to St Patrick's College, Maynooth. In 1870 he was invited by Gladstone's government to act on a commission of inquiry into the treatment of Irish treason-felony prisoners in English gaols, and in connection with this inquiry he visited many French prisons and reported on the discipline exercised in that country. He enthusiastically recommended the reafforesting of Ireland, and with the agreement of the government collected information on forests from foreign countries, which was embodied in an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of Forestry and Estate Management</span> in 1883. He sat in the House of Commons for the city of Dublin as a Liberal from April 1880 to the general election in 1885, and spoke on the <span class="roman">Parliamentary Oaths Act</span> in May 1883. Lyons wrote widely on subjects in medicine, education, and forestry, publishing a number of essays and monographs between 1850 and 1885. Of these <span class="italic">A handbook of hospital practice, or, An introduction to the practical study of medicine at the bedside</span> (1859), <span class="italic">Intellectual resources of Ireland: supply and demand for an enlarged system of Irish university education</span> (1873), and <span class="italic">Forest Areas in Europe and America, and Probable Future Timber Supplies</span> (1884) are of particular interest. In 1856 Lyons married Marie, daughter of David Richard Pigot, lord chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland. He died on 19 December 1886 at 89 Merrion Square, Dublin, and was survived by his wife.<br>
