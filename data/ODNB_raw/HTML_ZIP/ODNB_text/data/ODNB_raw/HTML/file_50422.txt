<span class="headword">Younger,  Henry Johnston</span>  (1832&#150;1913), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born on 5 October 1832 at Moffat, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, the second son of William Younger (III), of Craigielands, Dumfriesshire, and his wife, the daughter of an Edinburgh surgeon. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the Royal College for Civil Engineers in London and first joined the family brewing firm in Edinburgh in 1852. After two years&#151;presumably having completed an apprenticeship&#151;he left for Australia, and spent much of the period 1855&#150;61 at a sheep farm in the Upper Murray river valley in Victoria, where many Scots had already settled before the gold rush of 1851. Coincidentally, in 1856 the firm entered the Australian market, which, on account of the gold rush, was experiencing boom conditions, and it is likely that Younger played a role in developing the business via Adelaide and Melbourne. Younger returned to Edinburgh in 1861 and became a junior partner to his elder brother, William Younger (IV), and another senior partner, Andrew Smith, whose family had been associated with the brewery since 1836.<br>
<br>When Henry Younger rejoined the business in 1861 William's share was estimated at &pound;82,000 and Smith's at &pound;46,000, while Henry's was a junior partner's modest contribution of &pound;2000. But within four years, when the joint capital was put at &pound;180,000, his share was nearly &pound;20,000, a tenfold increase on his initial holding. The old-established firm of William Younger already had an extensive trade at home and overseas, with important markets south of the border, mainly on Tyneside and in London, where in 1866 Younger was put in charge of the new office. William Younger (IV) died in 1854 and Andrew Smith retired from the business in 1869, leaving control in the hands of three partners, Henry Younger, who became senior partner, his brother David, who had joined the brewery after studying at the University of St Andrews, and Alexander Smith, the son of Andrew Smith.<br>
<br>The firm expanded considerably in the 1870s and early 1880s, and by 1885 its home sales alone were worth more than &pound;400,000 a year, making it the leading brewing enterprise in Scotland. Scottish markets absorbed a little over half of sales, while English and overseas outlets accounted for much of the remainder. During this period both the Abbey and the Holyrood breweries were greatly extended (including stores and bottling plant), and new maltings were built on the Water of Leith at Canonmills. Younger's attention to the London end of the business, a high proportion of which was directed to colonial markets, as well as his passionate concern for quality control, clearly enhanced the firm's reputation in this highly competitive sector.<br>
<br>William Younger &amp; Co. was the first major brewery in Scotland to register with limited liability, in 1887, and three years later, during the general boom in brewery shares caused by the increasing prosperity of the industry, it was floated as a public company. With Younger (as chairman), Andrew Smith (grandson of the first Andrew Smith), and Alexander Bruce (son-in-law of the explorer and missionary David Livingstone) as leading members of the board, the company had an authorized capital of &pound;1 million, divided equally between ordinary and preference shares&#151;a capitalization matched only by their great Edinburgh rival, the more recently established firm of William McEwan.<br>
<br>This was a period when important scientific discoveries were being made in the chemistry of brewing, leading to significant improvements in quality control and a wider range of products, including bottled beers and lagers. In 1884 Younger had ordered the translation of Louis Pasteur's famous paper on fermentation and the chemistry of yeasts, and later welcomed the scientist to Edinburgh. He also donated &pound;500 to Edinburgh University for its building extension fund in Pasteur's honour.<br>
<br>Although he effectively retired from active management on becoming chairman of the board, Younger continued to take a keen interest in the company and kept in constant touch with its affairs. In 1889 he bought the adjoining estates of Benmore and Kilmun at the head of Holy Loch in Argyll, part of which was maintained and developed as an arboretum and later gifted to the nation by his son Harry George Younger. The estate ultimately became an important satellite to the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. Younger was a deputy lieutenant and JP in Argyll for many years and was described as &#145;an all-round sportsman and an ideal host&#146;.<br>
<br>Younger was twice married: first to Sarah Emma Lowman; secondly to Jane Edith Richardson. He had four sons and five daughters&#151;three of the sons ultimately becoming directors of William Younger &amp; Co. He suffered a heart condition for some years prior to his death, at Earls Court Hotel, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 6 March 1913. He left a personal estate of &pound;509,000 gross, with holdings in William Younger &amp; Co. Ltd valued at &pound;181,000, and other major holdings in railway and industrial enterprises. Younger's career might be compared with that of his near contemporary, the apparently more dynamic William McEwan. The latter entered politics and hence had a higher public profile, whereas Younger confined himself mainly to his business and family. Nevertheless Younger made a significant contribution to the success of a major brewing enterprise in the heyday of the industry before the First World War.<br>
