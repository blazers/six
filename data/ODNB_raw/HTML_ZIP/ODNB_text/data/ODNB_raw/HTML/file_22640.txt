</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Povey,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1613/14, <em>d.</em> in or before 1705), <span class="occ">colonial entrepreneur and administrator</span>, was the son of Justinian Povey (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1652), auditor of the queen's revenue and auditor of the exchequer, and his second wife, Anne Keterick (<i>d</i>. 1657). One of a family of at least nine children, he seems originally to have been destined for the law and entered Gray's Inn in 1633. Believing the civil war to be unjustifiable, he had at first taken up a non-partisan stance, expounding his views in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Moderator, Expecting Sudden Peace or Certaine Ruine</span> (1643), which elicited three hostile responses, the last entitled <span class="italic">Neutrality is Malignancy, by J.M.</span> (1648). Povey was elected an MP for Liskeard in March 1647, only to be secluded at Pride's Purge in December 1648. As the English revolution progressed, moderation became ever more suspect; Povey was thought to be disloyal to the council of state and in 1650 a warrant was issued for his arrest. Trade now seemed a safer and more profitable pursuit than politics, particularly since Povey possessed, so he avowed, a fortune hardly sufficient to support him. There was a family connection with the colonies; his father had been appointed a commissioner of the Caribbee Islands in 1637.<br>
<br>In 1654 Povey helped to fit out the &#145;western design&#146; fleet, working closely with the London merchant-capitalist Martin Noell, principal banker to the government and, as Povey noted, a man in &#145;extraordinary favor&#146; with Cromwell  (Andrews, 50). Two of Povey's brothers accompanied the fleet, and although this expedition was, in many respects, an ill-organized fiasco, the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle did not hurt the Poveys. Richard and William Povey acquired minor offices in Jamaica and Barbados respectively and Thomas himself soon became a recognized expert on matters colonial. He was to remain at the centre of colonial affairs for the next decade.<br>
<br>A whole series of papers concerning the proper governance and commercial exploitation of England's colonies flowed from Povey's pen. It was probably he who first proposed a council of trade, to which he was duly appointed in 1655, and he became the chairman, secretary, and most active member of the council for America (1657). Throughout the vicissitudes of protectorate, restored Commonwealth, and restored monarchy, Povey kept his nerve, built up his contacts and tailored his &#145;overtures&#146; and &#145;propositions&#146; to suit the situation. He maintained an extensive correspondence with governors and other colonial officials and acted as a minor patronage broker, although he modestly disclaimed to be anything but a &#145;Journeyman&#146;, with &#145;little power&#146; but &#145;greater industrie&#146;  (Bliss, 261).<br>
<br>Povey continued to invest in colonial trading schemes with Noell and others, some profitable, some not (the Nova Scotia Company was probably among the latter). His fortune grew; he had found that the marriage market could offer as much as the colonial in the disordered days of the late 1650s and in 1657 he married Mary, daughter of John Adderly, widow of John Agard of King's Bromley, Staffordshire, &#145;a handsome old woman that brought him money&#146;  (Pepys, 4.297). An elegant house next door to the residence of the earl of Northampton was built for the Poveys on Arch Row, the most fashionable part of Lincoln's Inn Fields. A daughter, Frances, married Giles Bland, executed in 1677 for his role in the Virginia rebellion.<br>
<br>In February 1659 Povey was elected to Richard Cromwell's parliament as an MP for Bossiney. A year later he was among the MPs secluded in 1648 who took their seats in the reassembled Long Parliament. To the moderate-minded Povey, the Restoration was both pleasing and profitable. In 1661 he was granted the receiver-generalship for the rents and revenues in Africa and America, the office &#145;being framed by him and he much versed in plantation affairs&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 94; <i>1663&#150;4</i>, 408). His colonial expertise was also recognized by an appointment to the council of trade (1660) and the secretaryship of the committee for foreign plantations (1661). In 1660 he became treasurer of the duke of York's household, and in 1662 treasurer of Tangier and surveyor-general of its victualling department. In 1662 also he was made a master of requests extraordinary, with the promise of the next ordinary vacancy.<br>
<br>Such prodigious pluralism took its toll, however. Povey was clearly overextended and in 1665 he resigned the treasurership of Tangier to Pepys: they were to share the profits equally. In 1666 he lost his place as the duke of York's treasurer, being replaced by Sir Allan Apsley. According to Pepys (a not entirely disinterested observer), Povey had neglected all his business and committed it to unfit hands  (Pepys, 7.191&#150;2) and it is clear that his accounts were in substantial disarray. Not surprisingly, Pepys found Povey &#145;mightily discontented &hellip; about his disappointments at Court&#146; in this period  (Pepys, 7.228). His career never recovered. As recorder of Thetford, he botched the management of the Thetford election in 1669; Sir Joseph Williamson, client of the powerful Arlington, had to look elsewhere for assistance. Understandably, an application in 1673 to discuss the transference of Williamson's council clerkship to Povey upon the former's elevation to a secretaryship of state was unsuccessful; there was a petulant tone to Povey's letter as he bewailed the fact that the good will and power of his friends had not as yet recommended him to some advantageous station  (Christie, 2.5&#150;6). It was becoming clear in this period that he could gain patronage and office only for his talented nephew, William Blathwayt, and not for himself. On James II's accession (1685) he lost his mastership of requests, although he remained a member of the queen dowager's council.<br>
<br>There was much more to Povey than his offices, however. Pepys found him &#145;most excellent in anything but business&#146;  (Pepys, 6.215). He was a gentleman of fashion and a &#145;nice contriver of all elegancies&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.84). The house in Lincoln's Inn Fields was a marvel: its cabinet work, wine cellar, stables, and pictures, especially the <i>trompe-l'&#339;il</i> perspectives, all gained universal admiration. Povey was a generous, if garrulous, host, always ready to retail the latest court gossip and to offer advice on social niceties. He was a connoisseur and collector (he donated thirty-eight rare volumes to the College of Arms) and an original member of the Royal Society, serving on its council in 1663, 1679, and 1691 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>]. Fascinated by things mechanical, in 1669 he applied with John Prichard for a patent for an engine for raising water and he perfectly conforms to the definition of the &#145;virtuoso&#146;: intensely curious, interested, as were Evelyn and Pepys, in the &#145;rare&#146; and the &#145;wonderful&#146;, a man of taste and discrimination and possessed of the funds to indulge them. In 1701 the financier Sir Stephen Fox congratulated Povey on his memory and his letter writing: &#145;No man in England of 87 years&#146; could compare  (Glos. RO, MS D1799/C9). His last appearance in the Royal Society's membership lists is 1702. Administration of his estate was granted to his nephew, William Blathwayt, in July 1705.<br>
