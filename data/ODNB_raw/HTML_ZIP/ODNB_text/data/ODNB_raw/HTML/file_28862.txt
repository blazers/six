<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  Robert</span>  (1746?&#150;1838), <span class="occ">revolutionary and adventurer</span>, was born in Elgin. A Robert Watson, son of a horse hirer, Robert Watson, and his wife, Catherine Demster, was baptized there on 29 June 1746, but at his death in 1838 Watson was described as eighty-eight years old. Throughout his life Watson confused and embroidered details of his career. The credence hitherto given to 1746 as his birth date rests mainly on accepting unverified claims that he had fought with the American army during the American War of Independence (and had achieved the rank of colonel, been wounded, and in recompense been granted land). These claims, made to the artist who painted his portrait in 1817, seem not to have been made elsewhere. Moreover by 1780 Watson was living in London and working as the private secretary to Lord George Gordon. Shortly before his death Watson claimed to have been deeply implicated in the riots of 1780. This is more plausible but, like the medical degree from a Scottish university of which he boasted, cannot be verified.<br>
<br>However, in August 1794 Watson did help foment a riot in London against coercive recruiting and was sentenced to two years in Newgate for circulating a handbill attacking the <span class="roman">Militia Act</span> and magistracy. While in prison he wrote a <span class="italic">Life of Lord George Gordon</span> which <i>inter alia</i> welcomed the fall of the Bastille as &#145;a step to universal emancipation&#146;  (p. 91). Watson also attacked continental Catholic clergy for their opposition to the French Revolution in the <span class="italic">Moral and Political Magazine</span> (March 1796) of the London Corresponding Society, which he had joined in 1792. Once released from Newgate, Watson was soon predicting the people would swiftly have &#145;recourse to steel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Moral and Political Magazine</span>, March 1797). A member of the society's executive, he was one of two delegates it sent to consult with the leaders of the Spithead naval mutiny in 1797. They were accompanied, perhaps without the executive's sanction, by a representative of the United Irishmen. How far the society's subsequent repudiation of Watson reflected a loss of nerve or was meant to obscure its complicity in revolutionary conspiracy is debatable. Watson was now communicating with the French agent at Hamburg about Britain's readiness for revolution, claiming that 50,000 Scots and 200,000 English were waiting on a French invasion as their cue for rising. In April 1798, on hearing a warrant had been issued for his arrest, Watson fled abroad. After travelling through Scandinavia and Germany he arrived in Paris in September.<br>
<br>For a brief period Watson was the principal English republican envoy in France. He issued a grandiloquent &#145;Address to the people of Great Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Moniteur</span>, 4 frimaire, an VII [24 Nov 1798]). In July 1799, in a memorial to the governing directory, he claimed (falsely) to be president of the London Corresponding Society and disclosed plans for provincial British radicals to greet a French invasion with a series of uprisings to force the dispersal of troops away from London and the south coast. Watson claimed briefly to have been English tutor to Napoleon, who appointed him to the presidency (1800&#150;06) of the Scottish College in Paris, a secular revival of the medieval foundation dispossessed at the revolution. He also travelled to Italy where (in an effort to support the beleaguered Napoleonic economy) he tried unsuccessfully to cultivate cotton on the Pontine marshes. In 1817 he became involved in a dispute with the Vatican over the ownership of papers that had belonged to Cardinal York, the Jacobite pretender Henry IX. Watson was instrumental in their acquisition by the British government, for which he was financially rewarded (inadequately he vehemently claimed) and the arrest warrant of 1798 annulled. Watson was also connected, possibly through marriage, to the aide-de-camp to the Young Pretender (Charles Edward Stuart), James Johnstone, the manuscript of whose history of the 1745 rising he sold to Longmans on returning to Britain in 1820.<br>
<br>Details of the later years of Watson's life are as opaque as the earliest. He spent some time in Greece but seems to have lived mainly in France. In 1825 he was writing from Paris begging for money needed, he said, to recover various possessions including the missal of Mary, queen of Scots, and the Constantinople <span class="roman">Bible</span>. By early 1838 he was living once again in London, at the Blue Anchor tavern, Thames Street, St Mary-at-Hill. There, on 19 November, he strangled himself by twisting his silk cravat with a poker as tourniquet. A &#145;little lame man&#146;, his body was found to bear the scars of nineteen previous wounds. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> reported that &#145;the body of the wretched old man was conveyed to the grave as that of a pauper, at the expense of the parish&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 11/1, 1839, 328).<br>
<br>Watson's Jacobitism represents a significant strand in British radicalism. His continued attachment to Jacobinism may be reasonably inferred from the identity of the friend who arranged his affairs after his death: Colonel Francis Macerone, sometime Italian revolutionary and aide-de-camp to Murat, whose writings on street fighting had been circulating among English ultra-radicals since the reform crisis.<br>
