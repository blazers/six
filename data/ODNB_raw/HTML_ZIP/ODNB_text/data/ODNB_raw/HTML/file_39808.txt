<span class="headword">Francis, Sir  Frank Chalton</span>  (1901&#150;1988), <span class="occ">museum director and librarian</span>, was born on 5 October 1901 in Liverpool, the only child of Frank William Francis, provision broker, who died in 1914, and his wife, Elizabeth Chalton, furrier; both parents were from Liverpool. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute; at Liverpool University, where he took a first in classics; and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he spent two years (1923&#150;5) engaged in research on early Greek philosophy, and of which he became an honorary fellow in 1959.<br>
<br>In 1925&#150;6 Francis taught at Holyhead county school, but in the latter year entered the British Museum as an assistant keeper in the department of printed books. He remained in the museum for the rest of his career. His work lay in the routines of the department, including, from 1930, the revision of the general catalogue, but like many of his colleagues he was also required to perform special language duties. For this purpose he acquired a knowledge of Swedish through classes at University College, London. In 1936 he joined the Bibliographical Society and in the same year became editor of its transactions, <span class="italic">The Library</span>. Francis served as secretary of the British Museum from 1946 to 1947, and in the following year was appointed keeper of printed books. He had already served as chairman of the Library Association's committee on central cataloguing, and played a major part in the establishment of the <span class="italic">British National Bibliography</span>, which was first issued in 1950. He was also largely responsible for terminating the revision of the museum's published general catalogue, and replacing it with a photolithographically produced edition of the working copy of the catalogue. This was published between 1960 and 1966, when Francis had already become (in 1959) director and principal librarian of the museum (posts he held until 1968).<br>
<br>Within the Bibliographical Society, Francis's editorship of <span class="italic">The Library</span> (until 1953) was combined with the honorary secretaryship, which he held jointly or solely from 1938 to 1964, guiding the society through the Second World War, and editing its <span class="italic">Studies in Retrospect</span> (1945). His position in the museum, his willingness to advise others, and his knowledge of historical bibliography involved him in the reconstruction and cataloguing of a number of older libraries, notably Lambeth Palace Library and the cathedral libraries. He lectured in historical bibliography at University College, London, from 1945 to 1959.<br>
<br>The British Museum had been severely damaged during the Second World War, and as director Francis continued the work of his predecessors in restoring galleries and in opening new ones (notably the Duveen gallery for the display of the Elgin marbles in 1962). He was particularly concerned to make the museum's collections more accessible to the public, and a feature of his directorship was the expansion of the museum's design, educational, and publication services. A notable example of the new attitude towards display was the Greek and Roman life room (1960). The museum's collections were greatly enriched, and one for which he had particular enthusiasm was the Ilbert collection of clocks (1958). Exhibitions were also brought in from outside the museum. The growth and improved display of both library and antiquities made the museum's need for more space imperative.<br>
<br>In line with his wish to make the collections of antiquities more accessible, Francis was also sympathetic to the growing demands that the museum's library should serve a wider public than its traditional clientele of scholars who sought manuscripts and older books in the humanities. In particular, a need had been voiced for a greatly improved reference service in the natural sciences. He believed that this must be met with the aid of the museum's existing privilege of legal deposit, and without jeopardizing the unity of the museum's library collections.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">British Museum Act</span> of 1963, upon which Francis had a direct influence, embodied much of this thinking. Besides changing the composition of the body of trustees, it empowered them to house parts of the collections outside the museum buildings, thus enabling the transformation of the department of ethnography into the Museum of Mankind, creating a legal basis for a new library, and permitting the establishment of the National Library of Science and Invention. The integration of the Patent Office library into the department of printed books, as the basis of the new scientific service, was one of the landmarks of his directorship. Francis also initiated serious planning for a new library building. Architects were engaged, and plans for a new building on the south side of Great Russell Street had reached an advanced stage when in 1967 the government revoked the decision to build on the Bloomsbury site. Thus the establishment of the universal library for which he had worked was set back, though not permanently, by the government's ruling, and by the subsequent setting up of the national libraries committee.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1968 Francis moved to Nether Winchendon near Aylesbury, while maintaining his links with the bibliographical and library worlds, and in particular with facsimile publishing. He continued to visit the United States, where he was highly regarded and had many friends. He was president of the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (1965&#150;6), Bibliographical Society (1964&#150;6), Library Association (1965), Museums Association (1965&#150;6), and International Federation of Library Associations (1963&#150;9). Honorary degrees were awarded by Oxford and Cambridge, and by other universities in Britain, Ireland, and North America. He was appointed CB in 1958 and KCB in 1960.<br>
<br>In appearance Francis was strong of profile, of medium height, and heavily built. He was handicapped by arthritis in later life. Genial and hospitable in private, he could be forceful and indeed dominating in public and official life. He married in 1927 Katrina Florence 
    (Kitty; <i>d</i>. 1991)
  , daughter of Thomas McLennon, warehouseman. They had two sons and one daughter. Francis died on 15 September 1988 at Chilton House, Chilton, Buckinghamshire, and was buried at Nether Winchendon.<br>
