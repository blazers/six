<span class="headword">Venables,  Robert</span>  (1612/13&#150;1687), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was the son of Robert Venables, gentleman, of Antrobus, Cheshire, and Ellen, daughter of Richard Simcox of Rudheath, Cheshire. His father could trace his ancestry back to the Norman conquest, but he was the head of the cadet branch of the Venables, while his mother's father and brother were on the cusp of the gentry and yeomanry, regularly serving as grand jurymen at assizes and quarter sessions.<br>
<br>When the civil war broke out in 1642 Venables volunteered for service and was commissioned a captain in the parliamentarian army being assembled in Cheshire by Sir William Brereton. He was reported to have been captured at an untidy skirmish at Westhoughton, Lancashire, but was soon released and served in his own county and in Lancashire throughout the first civil war, as captain and then lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Robert Duckenfield and then of Brereton himself. In 1644 he distinguished himself in the defence of Nantwich and he was seriously wounded at the siege of Chester; but by the spring of 1645 he was governor of Tarvin, the town that acted as headquarters for the siege operations at Chester, just 5 miles away. The letter books of Sir William Brereton reveal him as a key member of the council of war that planned that siege, and one of Brereton's main allies in the feuds within the Cheshire committees and between Brereton and his fellow generals in neighbouring counties. He was one of the signatories of the articles under which Chester finally surrendered on 1 February 1646, and he was one of those whom Brereton recommended to parliament for appointment as governor of this strategically vital town. Instead he was put in charge of a force that was sent to reduce the remaining royalist garrisons in north Wales.<br>
<br>Venables remained in arms in 1647 and 1648 but was also active as a civil commissioner, and spent much time trying in vain to secure payment of arrears of &pound;2113. In summer 1647 mutineers in Nantwich imprisoned members of the county committee and held them to ransom for their arrears, and he borrowed another &pound;232 to end the crisis. A year later he was still awaiting compensation. Late in 1648 he was called up to army headquarters in London, and on 15 December, still a lieutenant-colonel, he was put in charge of a committee of lower-ranking officers charged with finding &#145;the best ways and grounds for the speedy bringing the king to justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarke</span>, 2.132).<br>
<br>In April 1649 Venables was commissioned a full colonel and ordered to raise a fresh regiment for Ireland. The names of his junior officers and NCOs suggest that he raised it in Cheshire. He crossed to Dublin in July, ahead of the main contingent of Cromwell's army of conquest, and joined Major-General Michael Jones (himself commander at the siege of Chester for several months in 1645) in time to take part in the crushing defeat of the king's lord lieutenant, the marquess of Ormond, at Rathmines on 5 August. He and his regiment then joined Cromwell and he was given the great responsibility of leading them to storm the breach at Drogheda after the first wave had been driven back with heavy casualties. It was also Venables's pikemen who prevented the drawbridge across the river that ran through the town from being raised and who made possible the massacre of the garrison on the north side of the town.<br>
<br>After the capture of Drogheda, Cromwell divided his army and sent Venables with three full regiments north to join up with the brutalized Sir Charles Coote for a ruthless reimposition of protestant control of Ulster. He moved steadily north, summoning and taking the surrender of Dundalk, Newry, Carlingford, and Belfast before relieving Coote in Derry. He then defeated Colonel Mark Trevor in a stiff engagement at Dromore. Cromwell was full of praise for his northern commander in a series of letters to Westminster.<br>
<br>In 1650 Venables and Coote continued the process of securing Ulster. They joined forces in June to crush the army of Ulster, commanded (following the death of Owen Roe O'Neill) by Bishop Heber McMahon of Clogher, at the battle of Scariffhollis (21 June; near Letterkenny in co. Donegal), putting 3000 men to the sword and summarily executing many prisoners. By the summer only Charlemont in the whole of Ulster lay in Catholic hands, and after a failed assault in which 800 English were killed, Coote and Venables accepted its surrender on terms (14 August). But securing all the towns and crushing the armies did not bring peace. Venables now became all too literally bogged down in a guerrilla war against &#145;tories&#146; in north Connaught and south-west Ulster that was to last for another two years, though he was also involved in the campaigns that led to the defeat of the final formal army of Catholics&#151;that of the earl of Clanricarde in Connaught.<br>
<br>By 1653 Ireland was pacified. Venables had fought a hard war, and had condoned, if he had not himself ordered, atrocities against those who had surrendered to mercy (that is, on conditions which left their lives at the mercy and discretion of the victors). He had shown courage, resolution, and grit. He had also shown forbearance. Being in a subsidiary theatre, his men had been poorly paid, poorly supplied, and&#151;at least, once Cromwell had returned to Britain&#151;poorly recognized. He was later to write an account of his service in Ulster, &#145;for all which,&#146; he sourly added, &#145;I never received further reward than a letter of thanks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 3).<br>
<br>Venables spent his last months in Ireland in bitter dispute with resettled presbyterian ministers who were trying to reimpose a strict confessional church on the model of their Scottish homeland. At one point he threatened to transplant them to Munster. Little is known of his own religion, other than that he was ascetically protestant and almost certainly a Congregationalist. He was also very active in drawing up the regulations for putting the severe <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> into effect in 1653. He lobbied hard on his own behalf and that of his men for satisfaction of arrears, and in December 1651 he received land to the value of &pound;1223 in part settlement of his own. But many of those who fought with him remained unsatisfied and in May 1654 he returned from Ireland to lobby on their behalf.<br>
<br>Venables's arrival coincided with the secret decision of the council of state to mount a surprise attack on the Spanish West Indies, and in August he was privily asked by Cromwell to command the military expedition (he agreed, though he was not formally commissioned until December). For twelve years he had been toughened by war and had become a fearless and resilient soldier. Cromwell admired what he had achieved in the bleak winter of relentless rain when they were both in Ireland. It was a big promotion to put him in charge of what was intended to be the first stage of a fundamental assault on the Spanish islands and mainland colonies in and around the Caribbean. In a few short weeks he was to bring ruin and ignominy on himself. He had just married (in June 1654) for a second time in mysterious circumstances. (His first wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Rudyard of Rudyard, Staffordshire, gentleman, but the date of their marriage and her death are not known.) His second wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;1689), widow of Thomas Lee of Darnhall, Cheshire, and daughter of Samuel Aldersey of Chester, later said that it was a marriage based on duty and in fulfilment of a promise rashly entered into (&#145;my engagement to him was before his going to Ireland; what it was is best known to himself And if he be willing as myself to bury it in silence, it shall never be repeated&#146;; Townshend, 24). It was a loveless match with someone who disliked his politics, disdained his religion, and disapproved of his manners. She escorted him to the Indies, but asserted that &#145;the success was very ill, for the work of God was not like to be done by the Devil's instruments. A wicked army it was, and sent out without arms or provisions&#146;  (ibid., 28). Venables himself claimed that his intentions were honourable: he had attempted &#145;to promote the gospel and serve the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 7). Perhaps his first error had been to take his new wife with him.<br>
<br>The council in its wisdom decided to share authority over the campaign between a general (Venables) and an admiral (William Penn) who had to make decisions with the advice and consent of three civilians with extensive knowledge of the Caribbean (this was the first real mistake). This group, with other veteran merchants from the area, planned the expedition. They put together an army of 1000 veterans and 8000 &#145;volunteer&#146; soldiers (this was the second mistake). They ordered the wrong food and forgot to take anything for storing water&#151;this on a tropical campaign (the third mistake). They had thirty-eight sound vessels to convey them and to take on any Spanish naval vessels they encountered (this was not a mistake). The commanders were given a free choice of target and considered Hispaniola (Dominica), St John's Island (Puerto Rico), or the area to the south of the Orinoco. Once they reached the Bahamas and took on extra supplies and 2000 extra troops, they decided on Hispaniola. It was intrinsically a good choice for it was fertile and well placed to launch further expeditions.<br>
<br>They sailed in the last fortnight of December in two squadrons, and arrived four weeks later in Barbados. They refreshed themselves, planned their expedition for two months and then sailed for Hispaniola, arriving on 13 April. By this time Venables and Penn were barely on speaking terms, and full of so much mutual mistrust that Venables seems genuinely to have suspected that Penn would offload him and his men and depart, leaving them marooned. There were bitter disputes about the division of supplies and inadequate contingency plans for Penn to come to Venables's assistance if he got into trouble.<br>
<br>The weather was foul: torrential tropical rain that ruined the gunpowder, caused the biscuits to rot, and made the rivers unfordable. Over-confident planning and under-confident soldiers proved a fatal combination. Having telegraphed their intentions to the Spaniards, they lost the element of surprise. After landing with 8000 men 40 miles from San Domingo they marched disconsolately through inhospitable wooded terrain and were twice ambushed by the Spanish (18 and 25 April). Venables lost about a third of his men and, bitterly complaining of their cowardice, got Penn to take him and the remainder off, though not without some delay. Very much as a means of saving face and seeking a compensatory triumph, Venables ordered Penn to take him to Jamaica, a less developed and economically (as it seemed) less promising island. Here he quickly gained a pyrrhic victory. He landed on 10 May and took the surrender of the capital on 17 May, but not before much of the garrison and many of the inhabitants had taken to the hills. Venables was faced with the prospect of a guerrilla campaign as stubborn as that fought by the tories in Ireland. He began the thankless task of rooting them out, but fell ill with a tropical fever.<br>
<br>Penn, fearing the consequences of this failure, abandoned Venables, and sailed for home with half the fleet on 25 June, determined to get his side of the story in first. On discovering this, Venables set off in hot pursuit in a vessel called the <i>Marston Moor</i>, but he failed to overtake Penn. He arrived in Portsmouth on 9 September 1655 &#145;almost a skeleton, and so weak he could neither stand nor ride&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 2.97). This did not spare him (or Penn) a spell in the Tower of London as a wrathful council and a distraught Cromwell (brooding on why God had deserted him in this great cause in which he had invested much hope) pondered whom to hold responsible. On 30 October Venables was released from prison but relieved of all his military commands. He retreated to Cheshire, far from the complaints of Cromwell if not those of Mrs Venables. He was effectively in disgrace for the rest of the protectorate.<br>
<br>Although some royalist sources later claimed that in his bitterness at his treatment Venables turned towards supporting a Restoration, there is little evidence of it. Although he lived close to the epicentre of support for Sir George Booth's pro-Stuart rebellion in August 1659 he took no part. On the other hand, when George Monck marched south in January he named Venables governor of Chester. Sir Edward Hyde sounded out loyalist gentry in Cheshire about whether it was safe to leave him in post once the king returned. He had heard good things of his political loyalty, but was troubled by his reputation for Independency in religion. So Venables was replaced.<br>
<br>Venables lived out the rest of his life in provincial obscurity. He bought a house at Wincham in Cheshire, less draughty and with more modern amenities than the rambling house at Antrobus where he had lived hitherto. He held no office and though he was questioned in early 1664 about possible involvement in the Farnley Wood Plot which was led by ex-Cromwellian soldiers, he was exonerated. He may have sheltered a fugitive (William Veitch) after the Pentland rising in 1667, and he seems to have remained a nonconformist in religion, but he was no political activist. He published a quietist tract&#151;<span class="italic">The Experienced Angler, or, Angling Improved</span>&#151;in 1662, with an epistle by Isaak Walton. It ran through five editions in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Venables's was a life of frustration. He served loyally in the civil war in England, and tenaciously in Ireland from 1649 to 1654. But he never received the recognition he deserved and he had to spend the years of peace seeking compensation for what he was owed. He was over-promoted and under-supported in a high-profile fiasco in the Caribbean that cost him his reputation. He had to live out his life as a disgraced man with a sharp-tongued wife who disapproved of all he stood for. &#145;There hath some cross passages fallen out betwixt me and [General Venables]&#146;, she wrote, &#145;upon which I have resolved never to proceed farther, but continue as I was&#146;  (Townshend, 24). Even the marriages he arranged for his son and daughter turned out badly: &#145;to relate the cross and unhandsome passages that fell out in these marriages are not only too tedious to relate but would be a grief to those that do yet survive&#146;, Elizabeth wrote  (ibid., 28). But one senses that he never heard the end of it and that death did not come too soon to him; he died at Wincham in his seventy-fifth year, and was buried in July 1687.<br>
