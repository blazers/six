<span class="headword">Beaumont,  Hughes Griffiths <span class="st"> [Hugh; Binkie]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1973), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was born at 97 West End Lane, Hampstead, London, on 27 March 1908, the younger son of Morgan Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1935), a barrister, and his wife, Mary Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brewer. His parents separated when he was two, and were divorced, his mother marrying a timber merchant, William Sugden Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1920). &#145;Binkie&#146;, as he became widely known (he was more formally known as Hugh), grew up believing that Beaumont was his true father.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Hugh Beaumont preserved a passion for anonymity, and was given to disseminating fanciful accounts of his origins. He was brought up in Cardiff and attended Penarth grammar school. He formed an early friendship with Ivor Novello (a close neighbour) and secured a precocious appointment, at the age of sixteen, as assistant manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff. Still in his adolescence, he moved on to a series of other minor managerial jobs before joining the firm of Moss Empires as assistant to H. M. (Harry) Tennent, administrator of Drury Lane, with whom, in 1936, he founded the producing management of H. M. Tennent Ltd. Neither at that time, nor after Tennent's death in 1941, was anything done to publicize the name of Beaumont, but it was at his persuasion that the firm came into existence and through his gifts that it sustained its long supremacy in the West End.<br>
<br>Beaumont and Tennent went into business with a &pound;10,000 float from a stockbroking member of the Cripps family. That was a reasonable sum in the days when a West End play could be presented at the average cost of &pound;1000. However, the partners lost much of their starting capital on a series of flops before they struck lucky with the 1937 production of Gerald Savory's <span class="italic">George and Margaret</span> which ran for 799 performances at Wyndham's. This was followed by Dodie Smith's <span class="italic">Dear Octopus</span> and other long-running shows which established Tennents as a highly profitable concern that magnetized backers like a triple-crown Derby winner.<br>
<br>It was during these first years that Beaumont struck up a lifelong and professionally fertile friendship with John Gielgud. All Beaumont's early experience had been on the business side. He was, Gielgud said, &#145;a modern man with no pretensions to education at all and no knowledge except what he had learned as he became successful&#146;. Throughout his career, his main objective was to have as many productions as possible playing in London. What those productions were, however, reflected a taste acquired partly from Gielgud, with whom he broke into classical territory with a 1939 <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and continued with the famous wartime seasons at the Phoenix and the Haymarket, and again at the Phoenix and the Lyric, Hammersmith, during the 1950s. He also developed a love for superbly dressed, resplendently cast high comedy for which the name of Tennents became a byword.<br>
<br>What won Beaumont such allies as Gielgud and No&euml;l Coward in the first place was an array of personal and managerial skills which he put unreservedly at their disposal. He saw it as his mission to produce the best artists under the best possible conditions; and, having decided who the best were, he looked faithfully after their interests with an invincible blend of paternal care, business acumen, and courteously absolute authority. &#145;The iron fist&#146;, Tyrone Guthrie said of him, &#145;was wrapped in fifteen pastel-shaded velvet gloves&#146;  (Guthrie, 143). Those who worked with him, actors and playwrights alike, had total faith in his artistic judgement. His theatre followed the West End star system, but whereas the usual practice was for a star to appear with a supporting company, stars appeared in constellations on the Tennents stage, persuaded by Beaumont to exchange solitary glory for the satisfaction of working with their equals.<br>
<br>Tennents never owned theatres. They had a long-standing tenancy at the Queen's and the Globe, and periodically occupied the Haymarket and theatres of the Albery group. During the war their profits were subject to the 40 per cent entertainments tax from which Beaumont sought exemption by forming a non-profit-making subsidiary&#151;Tennent Productions&#151;for the presentation of classical work. By the end of the war he had thus amassed a surplus of &pound;70,000 with which, in 1946, he also took over the Lyric, Hammersmith, for classical seasons and West End try-outs by the newly created Company of Four.<br>
<br>The immediate post-war years marked the zenith of Tennents' prestige: a gathering of major stars and new names (including Christopher Fry and Peter Brook) mobilized in a lavish firework display exactly matching the anti-austerity mood of the time. However, there were also growing murmurs against Tennents' non-profit-making status, which reached a head with the officially &#145;educational&#146; premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">A Streetcar Named Desire</span> (1949), at which the Arts Council withdrew its support and the Inland Revenue promptly converted the charitable surplus into unpaid tax, and put in a large demand which Beaumont unsuccessfully contested in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>This defeat did nothing to shake the firm's theatrical fortunes or diminish Beaumont's power (in Guthrie's words) as the man, more than any other, who could &#145;make or break the career of almost any worker in the British professional theatre&#146;  (Guthrie, 142).<br>
<br>What did bring the firm into decline was the explosion of new writing that began from the Royal Court theatre in 1956, and the growth of subsidized theatre at the expense of the commercial sector. Beaumont's West End flourished like a traditional grocery shop, selling reliable brands to regular customers. The fashions of 1956 consigned these brands to the dustbin although Beaumont struggled to replace them with such newcomers as Robert Bolt and Peter Shaffer. Nor was there any effective way of fighting subsidized competition by a manager who believed that the theatre should stand on its own feet.<br>
<br>During his twenty years of supremacy Beaumont did more to raise the standard of the London theatre than any other manager, past or present. The new stage that overwhelmed him was one that he had done much to create. A homosexual, he had no family; the theatre was his business, his pleasure, and his life. He died at his home, 14 Lord North Street, London on 22 March 1973.<br>
