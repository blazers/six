<span class="headword">Bohun,  Humphrey (IV)  de</span>, second earl of Hereford and seventh earl of Essex  (<em>d.</em> 1275), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2773/', "Henry de Bohun, first earl of Hereford")</script>, and Matilda or Maud, daughter of Geoffrey fitz Peter, earl of Essex, and sister and heir of William de Mandeville, earl of Essex. His father (the first Bohun earl of Hereford) died in June 1220, and in June the following year, at the petition of King Alexander of Scotland and the barons of England, Humphrey was permitted to succeed to the family estates, concentrated for the most part in the Welsh marches and in Wiltshire, including the castle of Caldicot in Monmouthshire and a share of the honour of Trowbridge. Through the marriage of Humphrey's grandfather to Margaret, sister of King William of Scotland, the Bohuns also controlled a considerable estate in Scotland. In February 1225 Humphrey de Bohun witnessed the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> as earl of Hereford, and his title to the third penny of the county of Hereford was confirmed in October 1225, presumably at the same time that he was belted as earl. William de Mandeville died in 1227, leaving Bohun's mother as countess of Essex for the remainder of her life. Following her death in August 1236 Bohun succeeded to her title, and to the honour and castle of Pleshey in Essex. Earl Humphrey married twice. His first wife was Matilda, daughter of Raoul de Lusignan, count of Eu (<i>d</i>. 1219), whom he had married by 1238 and who brought her husband various lands in Kent. She died on 14 August 1241 and was buried at Llanthony. He married second Matilda of Avebury, who died on 8 October 1273 at Sorges in the Dordogne.<br>
<br>In 1227 Bohun joined the earls of Cornwall, Chester, and Pembroke in their brief confederation against the king, but he served on the king's expedition to Brittany in 1230, and, at the coronation of Queen Eleanor in 1236, carried out the ceremonial duties of marshal of the king's household. In 1237 he made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and in 1239 he was one of the sponsors at the baptism of Edward, the king's first-born son. From 1239 until 1241 he was sheriff of Kent and constable of Dover. He took part in the king's expedition to Poitou in 1242, and in 1244 assisted the repression of a Welsh rising on the marches. However, later that same year the Welsh rose again, angered, it was said, by Bohun's retention of the dower lands of Isabella de Briouze, his son's sister-in-law and the wife of Dafydd, son of the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>d</i>. 1240). In 1246 Bohun was among the English barons who wrote to the pope in defence of the liberties of the church in England. In 1250 he took vows as a crusader, but seems not to have gone on crusade. Two years later he was one of the barons who spoke in defence of Simon de Montfort against the king. In 1253 he joined the king's expedition to Gascony, but took offence at the actions of the king's Lusignan half-brothers who had inflicted summary punishment upon various Welsh mercenaries, without referring the case to the court over which Bohun presided as hereditary constable of the king's army. As a result he returned to England together with various other leading barons. In 1257 he was one of those set to defend the marches against attacks from the Welsh.<br>
<br>Humphrey de Bohun joined the confederation of the barons in 1258, and was appointed to enforce the sentence of banishment imposed upon the king's Lusignan kinsmen. Under the provisions of Oxford, he was elected to the baronial council of fifteen and in 1260 was nominated as justice on eyre for the counties of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford. Thereafter, however, he broke with the party of Simon de Montfort, and renewed his support for the king, receiving custody of the Welsh lands of the honour of Gloucester between July 1262 and August 1263. He was one of the royalists captured at the battle of Lewes in May 1264, in which his son, Humphrey (V) de Bohun (known as Humphrey the younger), took the side of the barons. Humphrey the younger was himself taken prisoner during the royalist victory at Evesham in 1265, after which Earl Humphrey obtained the reversion of his son's lands. In October 1265 he served as royalist keeper of the city of London, and in 1266 was one of the arbiters appointed to administer the dictum of Kenilworth. He died on 24 September 1275 and was buried at Llanthony (Prima) Priory, in Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>Shortly before his death Bohun had conveyed the honour of Pleshey to his younger son, Henry de Bohun. The remainder of his estate passed to his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2776/', "Humphrey (VI) de Bohun (d. 1298)")</script>, son and heir of Humphrey the younger, who had died in captivity on 27 October 1265, at Beeston Castle, near Chester. Besides his son Humphrey, Bohun had other sons named Henry, John, and Savaric, and at least four daughters, including Matilda, the wife of Anselm Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1245). He was a regular though not lavish patron of the religious orders, granting and confirming lands to Llanthony, to the Mandeville abbey of Walden in Essex, and shortly before his death to the nuns of Lacock in Wiltshire. Despite his supposed hostility to the king's alien courtiers, it is intriguing to note the Poitevin and Gascon connections of both of his wives.<br>
