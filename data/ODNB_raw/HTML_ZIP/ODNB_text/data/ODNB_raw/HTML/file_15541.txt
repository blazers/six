<span class="headword">Killigrew, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1606, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">courtier and playwright</span>, was baptized on 28 May 1606 at Hanworth, near Hampton Court, Middlesex, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15537/', "Sir Robert Killigrew (1579/80&#150;1633)")</script> and Mary, daughter of Sir Henry Woodhouse of Kimberley, Norfolk; he was brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Henry Killigrew (1613&#150;1700)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15538/', "Thomas Killigrew (1612&#150;1683)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears16061628"></a>Early years, 1606&#150;1628</h2>Killigrew was probably educated, from about 1616, at the grammar school in Cripplegate, London, of Thomas Farnaby, the classical scholar, who enjoyed Sir Robert's patronage. About 1619 he may have been sent to the continent to serve as a page at the court of the princes of Orange. As the eldest son, in 1623 William inherited from his paternal grandmother Margerie Killigrew &#145;tenn pounds of lawfull englishe moneye&#146;  (Margerie Killigrew's will), twice the amount left to his brothers Charles (1609&#150;1629), Robert (1611&#150;1635), Thomas, and Henry but substantially less than the enamelled chain plus &pound;50 left to his eldest sister Anne (1607&#150;1641).<br>
<br>On 4 July 1623 Killigrew entered St John's College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, taking up the study of civil law. While at Oxford he contributed a poem to <span class="italic">Carolus redux</span> (1623), a collection celebrating Prince Charles's return from Spain after his wooing of the Infanta. It is doubtful whether William completed the full course of his studies, for on 9 April 1624 the privy council issued a pass for William Killigrew and Maurice Berkeley, a cousin, &#145;esquires, to travell into the partes beyond the seas for the terme of three yeares and to take with them three servantes, their trunks, and other necessary provisions&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, 202). Within one or two years at most, William must have been back in England. In 1625 or 1626 he married Mary Hill, daughter of John Hill of Honiley, Warwickshire; and in May 1626 he was knighted. They had seven children, only two of whom, Captain William and Sir Robert (both living in 1701), were to survive their father. Shortly after his return from his travels, Killigrew obtained a &#145;firm foothold&#146; at Whitehall  (Dasent, 128), being appointed gentleman usher of the privy chamber to Charles I. From now on, he was to hold several major offices of a very diverse character. On 3 March 1628 he was elected by double returns to Charles's third parliament as a member for Newport and Penryn, Cornwall, but he sat only for the latter; and on 21 March following he and his father were jointly granted the governorship, for life, of Pendennis Castle, in the same county.<h2>
<a name="Soldierandbusinessman16281642"></a>Soldier and businessman, 1628&#150;1642</h2>Entrusted with the task of guarding the safety of the south-west coast of England, Killigrew was faced at Pendennis with a twofold problem: the poor condition of the stronghold, inadequately garrisoned and in need of urgent repairs; and the quarrels with the fort of St Mawes, trying to usurp the prerogatives of Pendennis with respect to ships entering Falmouth Bay. Killigrew showed himself tenacious of his privileges as governor. As one captain testified in November 1631, Killigrew &#145;is at peace with neither King's ships nor others; both the Admiral and the writer have been twice shot at by him, going in and coming out&#146;. Sir William was reprimanded by the admiralty and instructed &#145;never more to offend in that kind&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 40&#150;41). In the course of 1632 and 1633, there were new charges of mismanagement. A Dutch vessel, after causing &pound;2000 worth of damage to an English ship, had been allowed to escape the harbour. Sir William, held personally responsible, was ordered to find compensation for the English captain's losses, all to no avail. This incident may have precipitated his resignation of the governorship, which he surrendered to Sir Nicholas Slanning in April 1635.<br>
<br>Even before his father's death on 22 November 1633, Killigrew had launched out on an adventure that was to preoccupy him in decades to come, the draining of the fenlands in Lincolnshire. On 30 April 1633 Killigrew, his father (involved in draining activities since 1629), and other &#145;adventurers&#146; were appointed as drainers of the Eight Hundred Fen in Lincolnshire. As stipulated in the various grants, the drainers were to be repaid for their expenses with portions of the drained lands: in 1635, the earl of Lindsey, the main undertaker, Sir William, and others were given 24,000 acres to be divided into 20 lots. A major shareholder, Killigrew from 1634 onwards found it increasingly difficult to keep up with the huge expenses, as is perhaps suggested by his continuous sale of property in Devon bequeathed him by his father. There was also fierce opposition from the commoners, who complained of the drainers' high-handed policy, aimed at the enclosing and dividing of their lands. Riots intensified between 1630 and 1640, the fen people playing havoc with the drainers' possessions, their crops, drains, and fences. He also sold, to Sir Nicholas Slunning, the royalist army officer and governor of Pendennis Castle, Cornwall, large tracts of land adjacent to the castle, including the area that subsequently became Trebah Gardens.<br>
<br>Despite such pressing problems, Killigrew never abandoned his belief in the &#145;family grandeur&#146;  (Harbage, 26). Like his sister Anne in 1636&#150;7 and his brother Thomas in 1636 and again in 1638, Killigrew in 1638 had his portrait painted by Anthony Van Dyck, who in the same year also painted a companion portrait of his wife Mary. In early 1642 Killigrew figured prominently in the events leading up to King Charles's attempt to arrest the five MPs. He was sent to the inns of court to publicize the accusations and seek support for the king, thus making himself guilty of a &#145;high breach of privilege of Parliament&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 60). The heavy fine he incurred always remained unpaid.<h2>
<a name="ThecivilwarandtheCommonwealth16421660"></a>The civil war and the Commonwealth, 1642&#150;1660</h2>At the outbreak of the civil war, Sir William was given the command, under Lord Bernard Stuart, of a troop of horse, the members of which by all accounts distinguished themselves in battle. As a reward for Killigrew's good services at the battle of Edgehill, where he led the charge on 23 October 1642, King Charles created him doctor of civil law at Oxford on 1 or 2 November. That Killigrew enjoyed the king's confidence is also suggested by the various missions with which he was entrusted, including that of a go-between in the peace negotiations of March 1643. In the eyes of many parliamentarian MPs, he had become identified as &#145;a great and principall Factor for the Cavaliers in this Rebellion and Designe&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 67). Contributions to the war effort, in Cornwall and elsewhere, would have constituted a heavy drain on Sir William's dwindling means. Writing from Exeter on 17 March 1644, he asked Edward Seymour, governor of Dartmouth, to provide him with &#145;pistolls and carrabins&#146;, ensuring him that he would be paid &#145;soe soone as my purse is a little replenished&#146;  (Devon RO 1392M/L16/44/19). His precarious financial situation impelled him to consider seeking a foreign appointment, for in May 1645 he applied for the position of English ambassador in Turkey, a post eventually given to Sir Thomas Bendish. In accordance with the Oxford articles signed by the royalists after the taking of the city on 20 June 1646, Killigrew on 5 November 1646 requested permission to compound for his estate (the practice by which royalists were fined for their &#145;delinquency&#146;). The investigation of his guilt was dragged out until 4 March 1651, when Killigrew's fine was set at one-sixth part of &pound;20.<br>
<br>Between 1647 and the Restoration, Killigrew in a series of &#145;fen pamphlets&#146;, all controversial in tone, gave expression to the drainers' viewpoints and called for a confirmation by law of their interests, meanwhile calling attention to what in 1648 he described as &#145;the poor estate of himself, his wife, and family, who do beg their bread&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 75). Unhampered by ethical principles, Killigrew was evidently prepared to resort to any means in order to remedy this situation, as appears from the testimony left by Richard Lygon, in a pamphlet dated 18 March 1654. At some time between 1647 and 1652, Sir William had connived with his cousin Jane Berkeley to defraud Lygon of an estate left him by their great-uncle Henry Killigrew (<i>d</i>. 1646) for the payment of his debts. From Lygon's meticulous (but presumably biased) account of the cousins' machinations, Sir William emerges as a smooth-talking and cunning schemer, whose prodigality may at least partly account for his family's destitution.<br>
<br>The most touching testimony as to the Killigrews' impoverished condition during the years of the Commonwealth is provided by the thirteen letters Killigrew addressed to Captain Adam Baynes (1622&#150;1670) between 19 April 1653 and 1 November 1659. A commissioner for the excise, the customs, and sequestered estates, Baynes was a parliamentarian sympathetic to the draining projects. Using Baynes as an intermediary, Killigrew petitioned the council of state on many occasions. His petition of 24 January 1654 was presented to the committee for the fens by Major-General Lambert himself. On 27 July 1654, the council ordered that the drainers be put in possession of the 24,000 acres allotted to them by the commissioners of sewers many years before. This ordinance was never enacted. Finding himself devoid of all manner of subsistence, Killigrew in his letter of 29 March 1655 contemplated leaving &#145;this Towne&#146; and seeking &#145;some remote place for a service where I am unknowne, and maye pass by a wronge Name&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 337). In so doing, he may have wanted to follow the example of those of his children who had already left the country. His eldest daughter, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1627?) had become a maid of honour to the princess royal in Holland in 1644 and married Baron Frederik van Nassau-Zuylestein in October 1648; Susan (<i>bap</i>. 1 April 1629) had joined Queen Henrietta Maria on the continent towards 1649; his sons Sir Robert and Captain William both served as soldiers of fortune in the Low Countries, the former from about 1650 until 1659, the latter some time before May 1660, when he married Helena Van der Maa, daughter of a prosperous citizen of The Hague. Judging from Sir William's letter of 15 November 1655, his wife too was living separated from him, the precariousness of their situation accentuated by the latent fear of anti-royalist persecution.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofCharlesII"></a>In the service of Charles II</h2>Even before the king's official Restoration in May 1660, Killigrew sent him a long letter of diplomatic advice, urging the monarch to accept the conditions on which his return was assumed to depend. As too many of the old royalists and the suffering clergy would expect compensation for their losses, he argued that it would be better for the king not to have the entire revenue at his disposal. Reminding Charles how at Oxford he had used to entertain the king his father with such considerations, Killigrew offered these reflections &#145;without any designe for myself&#146;  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 244). The letter served its purpose, for by July or August 1660 Killigrew was again appointed gentleman usher of the privy chamber and took up lodgings at Whitehall. Shortly afterwards, by February 1664 at the latest, he was made the queen's vice-chamberlain, a position worth &pound;500 a year.<br>
<br>Killigrew evidently used his position at court to acquire various grants and offices for himself and his family. Together with Dorothy Spencer, countess of Sunderland, he was granted parts of &#145;the profits of certain concealed waste lands in several counties&#146; in June 1661; and in February 1662, both he and Thomas Chiffinch, keeper of the king's jewels, were granted a share of &#145;certain bonds for sequestration moneys in Lancashire&#146;, in the amount of &pound;786.  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 106). In January 1664, Killigrew was involved in the contract made by the king with the Company of Pinmakers. His role as an intermediary in raising &pound;5000 for the purchase of wire for the company's use was to have yielded him &pound;100. (As late as 10 March 1676, the pinmakers' plan to reinvigorate their trade was again submitted to the king in a petition signed by Killigrew.) Before 1665, his wife Mary became a dresser to the queen, with an annual pension of &pound;300. In the same year, Killigrew and some co-petitioners requested a grant of the forfeited houses in the town of New Ross, co. Wexford, Ireland.<br>
<br>Killigrew also remained active in the political arena. On 9 April 1664, he was returned to parliament for Richmond, to succeed Sir John Yorke, deceased. He served on several committees in this Long Parliament, which sat from 8 May 1661 until 24 January 1679. And he distinguished himself, as John Milward noted in his parliamentary diary for the years 1666 to 1668, for his unflagging zeal as a defender of the works of draining in Lindsey Level, &#145;stoutly maintaining &hellip; the ancient bill&#146; brought in twice in November 1667  (Vander Motten, <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>, 120). When this issue had been brought up for discussion in 1660 and 1661, the drainers and the landowners in the fens had angrily exchanged pamphlets that recapitulated the arguments formulated throughout the 1640s and 1650s. In the debates surrounding the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1673, stipulating that all persons holding office in the service of the king or the duke of York were to take an oath of allegiance, Killigrew on 21 March spoke in favour of the amendment excusing the queen's servants from the oath. His loyalty, however, was never a matter of doubt: from 1669 until 1678, his name occurs in several lists of members of the court party, one of these drawn up by the lord treasurer, the earl of Danby, himself.<br>
<br>From letters sent to Danby in 1674, it appears that Killigrew had been closely involved in the king's financial policy. Charles had promised him a pension of &pound;2000 if he were able to increase the two main branches of the revenue, the customs and the excise, both collected by means of the farming system. But Killigrew's proposals had been largely neglected and the pension which he had obtained towards the end of 1665 had amounted to only &pound;500. He now submitted new proposals to the treasurer designed to secure a larger return from the excise. Although his views largely coincided with Danby's own policy, Killigrew's attempts to obtain a (profitable) lease of the excise farm remained unsuccessful. Plans to raise the &#145;Hearth money&#146;, a taxation on fireplaces, which he broached in a letter dated 16 December 1675, went unnoticed as well. Sir William and his wife probably lived in straitened circumstances, as is suggested by the monthly advances made on their pensions from July 1676 on. Sir William continued at Whitehall as vice-chamberlain to the queen until 27 July 1682, when he transferred his office to George Sawyer. But he held on to the annual profits of &pound;516 and was allowed to move his lodgings to Hampton Court.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalyears16821695"></a>The final years, 1682&#150;1695</h2>That Sir William's spiritual retirement from the world commenced even before he relinquished his office at court is amply illustrated by the various collections of pious cogitations which he brought out in late 1681. The tone was set by <span class="italic">Midnight Thoughts</span> (1681), with its lengthy subtitle hinting at the author's lifelong exertions in the fens as well as his new found confidence in the grace of God. <span class="italic">Artless Mid-Night Thoughts</span> (dated 1684 but probably published in 1690) was partly a reissue of the 1681 collection. While most of the reflections on the frailty of human nature and the idea of imminent death were biblically inspired, Killigrew's self-examinations were indebted to contemporary meditative practices, Jesuit and Quaker as well as puritan and Anglican. The tranquillity of mind that professedly came with the search for a religious anchorage could not shield the old courtier from all worldly anxieties. Late in 1691 he brought an action of covenant against George Sawyer, requesting six years' arrears of salary, dating from 1682. By October 1691, he was living at Westminster Abbey, with his brother Henry. In response to Anthony Wood's enquiries about the Killigrew brothers, Sir William on 28 October and 4 November 1691 provided the biographical information that served as a basis for the account in <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>. On 3 October 1695 he drafted his last will. To his sons Sir Robert and Captain William he bequeathed 2000 acres of fenland; 2500 acres more were to be used for repaying his creditors. Sir William Killigrew died a few days later and was buried in the Savoy chapel on 17 October. Mary, his wife, left unmentioned in the will, may have predeceased him a few years earlier.<br>
<br>Like many other gentleman amateurs, Sir William after 1660 had provided the recently re-opened theatres with a number of moderately successful plays. The first three of these, the tragicomedies <span class="italic">Selindra</span> and <span class="italic">Ormasdes</span> and the comedy <span class="italic">Pandora</span>, were published in <span class="italic">Three Playes</span> (1664). Together with another tragicomedy, <span class="italic">The Siege of Urbin</span>, they were reissued in 1666 as <span class="italic">Four New Playes</span>. <span class="italic">Selindra</span>, performed by the King's Company at Gibbons's Tennis Court, Vere Street, on 3 March 1662, was one of the first new plays to be given after the Restoration. According to the prompter John Downes, it was revived at the Theatre Royal, Bridges Street, some time between 1663 and 1682  (Downes, 15). <span class="italic">Ormasdes</span> was Killigrew's attempt to join the short-lived post-Restoration vogue for plays in decasyllabic couplets initiated by Roger Boyle's <span class="italic">The Generall</span>. Whether it was ever performed remains uncertain. Entered in the Stationers' register as a comedy in May 1664, <span class="italic">Pandora</span> had apparently failed on the stage as a tragedy. John Downes included it in a list of plays &#145;both Old and Modern&#146; staged at the Duke's Theatre, Lincoln's Inn Fields, between 1662 and May 1664  (ibid., 26). Designed for the new, scenic stage, <span class="italic">The Siege of Urbin</span>, Killigrew's best play, was probably performed in 1665, at the Theatre Royal, as is suggested by the cast of actors contained in the manuscript copy of the play preserved in the Bodleian Library. <span class="italic">The Imperial Tragedy</span>, an adaptation from <span class="italic">Zeno, sive, Ambitio infelix</span>, a Latin blood-and-horror play by the English Jesuit Joseph Simons (1593&#150;1671), was Killigrew's last play. Published in 1669, it may have been acted at the Barbican Nursery after 1671  (Langbaine, 535).<br>
<br>Apart from their exploration of the conflicting claims of love, honour, and friendship, <span class="italic">Selindra</span>, <span class="italic">Ormasdes</span> (renamed <span class="italic">Love and Friendship</span> in the 1666 edition) and <span class="italic">The Siege of Urbin</span>, no less than Killigrew's only tragedy, share with Restoration tragicomedy a marked concern with political issues of current interest, focusing as they do on matters of succession, usurpation, and royal and paternal authority. In its confrontation of old-fashioned Platonic ideals and modern libertine views, <span class="italic">Pandora</span> reflects the author's commonsensical approach to such issues as love, marriage, and the battle of the sexes. Although of limited literary value, Killigrew's plays are of historical importance for the evidence of authorial revisions some of the printed editions contain, shedding light on a Restoration dramatist's efforts in bringing his plays to final form.<br>
