<span class="headword">Plunket,  John</span>  (1668&#150;1738), <span class="occ">Jacobite conspirator</span>, was born in Dublin between January and July 1668, although further details of his parentage and early years are unknown. He was educated at the Jesuits' College in Vienna, where he received a doctorate of civil law. It is unclear how Plunket became involved in work for the Jacobite cause, for which, using the alias Rogers, he served as an excessively imaginative, yet often unofficial, agent from approximately 1710 until 1722. His role was the communication of information between the exiled Jacobite court and contacts in London. However, his tendency to exaggerate his intimate acquaintance with foreign statesmen and prominent Jacobites in Britain and abroad, typically to magnify his own importance, rendered his behaviour highly suspicious and often downright ludicrous.<br>
<br>Described by a fellow agent as &#145;an ill figure of a man and as ill in utterance&#146;  (Macpherson, 2.425), Plunket should be included among several minor Jacobite agents whose reports have been characterized as &#145;wildly varying in optimism and accuracy&#146;  (Szechi, 7). In 1715 the duke of Berwick complained to his half-brother James, the Stuart Pretender, that Plunket pretended to possess secret letters of great importance, expressing disquiet at the agent's penchant for &#145;inventing this strange stuff&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 3.355). Whatever his reputation for falsehood, Plunket's historical significance derives from his involvement in two very different, largely abortive, conspiracies (the first in 1712, the second 1722) against the British monarchy, though his role and the implications of these events remain open to debate.<br>
<br>In spring 1712 Plunket sent to the lord treasurer, Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, several forged letters supposedly written by the allied commander Prince Eugene of Savoy and addressed to Count Zinzendorf, Austrian ambassador at The Hague, for dispatch to Vienna. The letters identified that the murder of ministerial leaders such as Oxford and Viscount Bolingbroke, the setting fire to the Tower, and the incitement of public unrest in London were salient features of a planned coup&#151;led by Eugene, the duke of Marlborough, the Hanoverian minister Baron Bothmar, and the principal whigs&#151;to remove Queen Anne and to derail the peace with France. Unbowed by initial scepticism, Plunket presented the correspondence to some of Oxford's more gullible colleagues, who insisted that he explain their provenance, which, before the privy council in April, Plunket revealed to be one of Zinzendorf's clerks in The Hague. None the less many still remained unconvinced; contemporary reports announced the arrival in Utrecht of &#145;an Irish papist here, who pretends &hellip; great correspondence in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 9.349). Later eighteenth-century assessments from writers sympathetic to Marlborough confirmed the spuriousness of Plunket's claim, identifying the agent as a &#145;miscreant Jesuit&#146; and one of Oxford's &#145;obscure and mercenary spies&#146;  (Coxe, 3.289, 291). In the twentieth century both G. M. Trevelyan and Winston Churchill dismissed the 1712 plot as &#145;rubbish&#146;  (Churchill, 2.924). More recently, however, research by Edward Gregg has suggested the credibility of a whig conspiracy on the basis of evidence that Marlborough did discuss the import of Dutch and Hanoverian troops to maintain the succession. It would appear that Plunket, while presenting forged correspondence, accidentally discovered &#145;compromising Marlborough&#150;Junto correspondence&#146;  (Szechi, 16&#150;17) setting out plans to repeat the events of 1688 and to prevent a separate Anglo-French peace.<br>
<br>From 1713 until early in 1718 Plunket resided mainly in Paris, visiting Jacobite haunts such as the Scots College. It is unknown what role, if any, he played in the rising of 1715. On his return to London he was rumoured to have communicated with Spanish agents in London, to have intercepted letters from George I's mistresses, and to have continued to send unsolicited letters to the Stuart court. In 1721 he took the all-important step of accompanying the Jacobite conspirator and lawyer Christopher Layer to Italy on legal business, thus setting in motion his involvement in a second conspiracy, now better known as the Atterbury plot. In Rome, Plunket and Layer held interviews with the Old Pretender, where they informed him of a proposed rising initially intended to coincide with the general election of 1722. Back in England by September, Layer now began to help recruit forces during which period Plunket is known to have accompanied Layer to at least one meeting of Jacobite minions in the London house of the third earl of Burlington. In September 1722 the plot was revealed and Layer arrested. His interrogation quickly implicated Plunket, who was apprehended in early October after a vigorous manhunt.<br>
<br>As with the events of 1712, the nature of Plunket's involvement in the Atterbury plot was variously interpreted. Certain accounts linked him with the prominent Anglo-Irish Jacobite sympathizer Charles, fourth earl of Orrery, and even elevated Plunket to the role of Orrery's agent. Others chose to treat Plunket and Layer as minor, foolish Jacobite pawns who, while implicated in the Atterbury plot, engaged in a conspiracy more imaginary than real. Certainly it appears that Plunket and other minor Jacobites persisted in preparations for their own modified plan for domestic military dissent&#151;&#145;the Scheme&#146;&#151;after similar efforts had been abandoned by the Jacobite hierarchy. There is also evidence to suggest that, whatever the nature of their relationship, Plunket overestimated the extent of Orrery's involvement in the Atterbury affair. None the less, in a charged political climate Plunket was identified by a Commons report of 1723 as among several minor figures who transacted &#145;Treasons with Lord Orrery's clerk&#146; and &#145;sent frequent Accounts to the Pretender's Agents abroad&#146; (Lambert, 3.13.40; <span class="italic">Historical Register</span>, 7.165). In the face of comprehensive government evidence Plunket feebly claimed no knowledge of any conspiracy, and denied that he had understood the purpose of Layer's visit to Rome or that he had met with the Pretender. However, Plunket's own correspondence contradicted these assertions and demonstrated communication with James prior to his visit to Rome, and how for many years he had been in contact with, among others, the Jacobite financier Sir William Ellis.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly many of Plunket's statements were further evidence of his tendency for exaggeration. Yet to his prosecutors such connections, coupled with his Roman Catholicism, were sufficient to single him out as a &#145;principal instrument in the said horrid and detestable Conspiracy&#146; (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 8.196; <span class="italic">Historical Register</span>, 7.150). Remarkable evidence demonstrating the true distance between Plunket and the core of the Jacobite movement is provided by the Pretender, who intimated that he had neither trusted nor employed Plunket, whom he believed had no &#145;particular business at all, &amp; I believe [he] came chiefly out of curiosity&#146;  (Stuart papers, 63/68).<br>
<br>Plunket spent the remainder of his life imprisoned in the Tower. His survival was aided by a state subsidy continued after George II's accession when rumours of a pardon proved false. By the mid-1730s he suffered acutely from gallstones, and he was taken from the prison on 23 July 1738 to be operated on by William Cheselden. However, he died, apparently unmarried, on the 24th at Cheselden's residence on James Street, Westminster; he was buried in St Pancras churchyard. His small quantity of books and personal effects was turned over to his nephew, Thomas Plunket. A drawing of him by a thirteen-year-old boy from 1727 remains untraced.<br>
