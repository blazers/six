<span class="headword">Victor,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">theatre manager and writer</span>, began life as a barber &#145;within the liberties of Drury Lane&#146;, but from the first was drawn to the stage. In 1722 he was at Norwich for a term, possibly to establish a business in the sale of Norwich linen. That year, after he had been introduced to Richard Steele by the poet and dramatist Aaron Hill, he defended, in <span class="italic">An Epistle to Sir Richard Steele</span> (two editions, 1722), Steele's play <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span> against the attacks of John Dennis. He married Mary Rooker (<i>d</i>. 1757) at Charterhouse Chapel, Finsbury, on 3 July 1722. In 1728 he was introduced to Barton Booth, and his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Barton Booth, Published by an Intimate Acquaintance</span> (1733) is one of the chief authorities on that actor's career.<br>
<br>After the arrival of Frederick, prince of Wales, in England in December 1728, Victor presented to him a congratulatory poem in the hope of obtaining a place in the prince's household, but was disappointed. The following year he composed a satire called <span class="italic">The Lev&eacute;e Haunter</span>, which looked for and gained the approval of Sir Robert Walpole. But Walpole was not much given to literary patronage, and Victor returned to the linen trade and established a business in Pall Mall. He experimented with acting, and played Polydore in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 18 April 1734, but does not seem to have acted again. Between 1734 and 1746 he made two visits to Ireland in order to extend his linen trade connections. The business did not prove profitable, however, and in January 1746 he resolved to give it up. On 11 October 1746 he settled with his family in Dublin as treasurer and deputy manager to Thomas Sheridan (1719&#150;1788) at the theatre in Smock Alley.<br>
<br>From that year Victor wrote the birthday odes for the court of Dublin, and the duke of Dorset, when resigning the position of lord lieutenant in 1755, obtained permission to appoint him poet laureate of Ireland, with a pension of &pound;50 per annum. Several of these painful productions are in his collections of 1776, and two of them, printed separately, are in the British Library. The theatre was for some years fairly successful, but about 1753 Sheridan was at odds with a portion of the theatregoing public, and for two years Victor and John Sowden, a principal actor in the company, took over its management. On 15 July 1755 Sheridan returned to Dublin, and Victor resumed his old position. After much discouragement and financial trouble the theatre was closed on 20 April 1759, and Victor returned to England, out of debt, but with little money at his command.<br>
<br>Between October 1758 and June 1759 Victor married his second wife, Penelope Wolseley (<i>d</i>. in or after 1794), the daughter of Sir William Wolseley, bt, and his mistress, Christina Horton, an actress. Victor had known Wolseley since 1729; Penelope had joined Sheridan's company at Smock Alley in February 1749, and acted as Penelope Danvers. In 1752 Victor drew up the articles for the marriage of Sir William to Ann Whitby. Whitby later claimed that the marriage had been forced upon her and that she was already married to John Robins. Victor wrote <span class="italic">The Widow of the Wood</span>, published in 1755, as an attack on Whitby and a defence of Wolseley; he was a witness for Wolseley when the latter sued for divorce on grounds of adultery, but Sir George Hay, the presiding judge, ruled that Ann Whitby had indeed already been married to John Robins, and so no divorce could be granted. Victor's book reached a second edition in 1769. Although it was written in support of Wolseley, it was said to be so offensive to members of the Wolseley family that they destroyed every copy of the narrative that they could obtain, but in the nineteenth century it was still to be found in catalogues of secondhand books.<br>
<br>Shortly after his return to England, Victor was appointed treasurer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, a post which he retained until his death. In 1761 he published, in two volumes, the work for which he is chiefly remembered, <span class="italic">The history of the theatres of London and Dublin from the year 1730, with an annual register of all plays performed at the theatres royal in London from 1712</span>, and in 1771 he published a third volume, bringing the narrative down to that date. The second volume has much information on the lives of the chief actors from about 1710 to 1745, and the work retains its value at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Its egotism was so marked that Charles Churchill said &#145;Victor ego&#146; should have been Victor's motto. Walley Chamberlain Oulton compiled in 1796 a continuation of the work in two volumes, bringing the record down to 1795, and in 1818, in three more volumes, he carried it on to 1817.<br>
<br>Victor published in 1776, with a dedication to David Garrick, three volumes of <span class="italic">Original Letters, Dramatic Pieces, and Poems</span>. The first volume preserved some interesting anecdotes, especially on Sir Richard Steele, and the second volume contained Victor's plays&#151;<span class="italic">Altamira</span>, a tragedy; <span class="italic">Fatal Error</span>, a tragedy; <span class="italic">The Fortunate Peasant</span>, a comedy; and <span class="italic">The Sacrifice, or, Cupid's Vagaries</span>, a masque&#151;all of which were unperformed. Victor also produced an adaptation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>, which was given five times at Drury Lane in 1763.<br>
<br>Victor was living in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, when he received a legacy of 50 guineas from Hester Booth. He died at his lodgings in Charles Street, Covent Garden, on 3 December 1778. His wife, Penelope, survived him, and was still receiving her pension of &pound;100 per annum (granted 1763) in 1794.<br>
