<span class="headword">Gwynn, Sir  Charles William</span>  (1870&#150;1963), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Ramelton, co. Donegal, on 4 February 1870, the third son in the family of six sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33620/', "John Gwynn (1827&#150;1917)")</script>, Church of Ireland clergyman and regius professor of divinity at Trinity College, Dublin, and his wife, Lucy Josephine (1840&#150;1907), daughter of the Irish nationalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20471/', "William Smith O'Brien")</script>. Among his brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33621/', "Stephen Lucius Gwynn")</script>, the author and nationalist MP; Edward John Gwynn (1868&#150;1941), provost of Trinity College, Dublin; Robert Malcolm Gwynn (1877&#150;1962), professor of Hebrew at Trinity College, Dublin; and John Tudor Gwynn (1881&#150;1956), who entered the Indian Civil Service and wrote on Indian affairs.<br>
<br>After schooling at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, Dublin, Gwynn entered the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich; an army career offered an escape from the academic milieu of his family. After obtaining a commission with the Royal Engineers on 15 February 1889 he took part in military operations in 1893&#150;4 against the Sofas in west Africa, was wounded three times, mentioned in dispatches, and appointed DSO. Promoted lieutenant, he joined the geographical section of the intelligence unit at the War Office in 1898. In 1900 he was sent with Lieutenant L. C. Jackson and a local Sudanese officer, Farag Efendi, to demarcate the Sudanese&#150;Abyssinian border, and identified specific areas of Abyssinian influence within the territory that lay between the Blue Nile and the River Sobat. Their survey was successfully completed on their arrival at Fashoda on 2 April 1900. Appointed CMG in 1903, Gwynn was attached to the Egyptian army and promoted captain in 1904. On his return he married at Raheny, Dublin, on 1 November 1904, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1951), the widow of Lieutenant Lowry Armstrong RN. Selected for study at the Staff College, Camberley, he graduated in 1906 and undertook a further year of study at the London School of Economics. In 1908 he was appointed commissioner of the Abyssinian and East African Boundary Commission and promoted to the rank of major, returning to serve in Dublin.<br>
<br>Gywnn had been earmarked as an outstanding officer and in 1911 he took up the post of director of military art at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Australia, an appointment that ensured his subsequent rise. At Duntroon, with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel, he made a considerable impression upon his Australian cadets as a tutor in military history, strategy, and tactics. After returning home in 1915 to join the staff of the Mediterranean expeditionary force he was ordered to Gallipoli as aide to Major-General James Legge of the 2nd Australian division, where he remained until the evacuation. In 1916 he became senior staff officer to Lieutenant-General Sir Alexander Godley, commander of the 2nd Anzac corps, and was posted to France in 1917, where he was able to fill a crucial supporting role to Godley during the British offensive at the battle of Messines. He served in France until the armistice, having taken part in the final advance of the First Army in 1918. Mentioned in dispatches six times, awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and promoted to the brevet ranks of lieutenant-colonel and colonel, he was appointed CB in 1918.<br>
<br>Gwynn commanded a brigade with the army of occupation on the Rhine in 1919. From 1920 to 1924 he was on the staff of eastern command, and in 1925 was promoted major-general, and retired to  Brittany on half-pay. His recall in May 1926 to become commandant of the Staff College at Camberley was remarkable, as that position was normally held by officers marked down for further promotion. He remained at Camberley until his retirement in 1931, when he was made KCB.<br>
<br>In retirement Gwynn wrote on military affairs as a military correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Of greatest long-term significance was his <span class="italic">Imperial Policing</span> (1934), which became a key army text book. Taking case studies from Amritsar in 1919 to Cyprus in 1931 (a second edition in 1939 added Palestine in 1936 and Waziristan in 1937), but deliberately excluding the recent experience of Ireland, he set out the defining principles that shaped the British army's role in support of the civil authorities in colonial contexts. His aim was to offer insights into the military viewpoint and to identify the problems created when using the army to undertake policing duties, so as to &#145;eliminate many possible sources of friction and facilitate co-operation [with the civil authorities] in such cases&#146;  (<span class="italic">Imperial Policing</span>, 1). The framework he presented for relations between police and the military and the identification of areas where the army would carry out police rather than military duties in the colonial era had continuing relevance; he correctly foresaw that the army would increasingly be called upon to carry out policing duties. He recognized that the role of the army and the colonial police forces could not be disentangled, and was clear that the one would always support the other despite there being a precedent of &#145;an element of prejudice against the employment of military force to maintain order&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The semi-military colonial police forces were often a territory's first line of defence, and Gwynn demonstrated that in cases of public disorder or the outbreak of a &#145;colonial&#146; war the army could be called upon to support the civil power, and even in some cases to assume police primacy. It was in these situations that he believed the army should adhere to certain general principles to ensure successful negotiations with the local authorities and the community. These included that the army was obliged to carry out government policy; that the military force employed should be the minimum a situation demanded; that military action be &#145;firm and timely&#146;; and that there should be effective co-operation between the army and police.<br>
<br>Gwynn's imperial policing theories gained importance after 1945 during the era of decolonization, when a spate of small colonial wars made it increasingly difficult for the police forces of empire to maintain control. <span class="italic">Imperial Policing</span> continued to be studied in military academies in the spirit in which it had been intended: not to award blame or praise for the army's actions but to stimulate thought on the problems involved in containing public disorder and conflict. In retirement Gwynn lived at Englefield Green, Surrey, until 1952 when, after his wife's death, he moved to Leeson Park, Dublin. He died in Dublin on 12 February 1963, and was buried at Tallaght, co. Dublin. He had no children.<br>
