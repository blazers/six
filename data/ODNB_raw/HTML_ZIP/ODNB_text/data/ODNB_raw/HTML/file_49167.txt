<span class="headword">Gilkes,  Arthur Herman</span>  (1849&#150;1922), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 2 November 1849 at Leominster, Herefordshire, the fourth child of William Gilkes (1813&#150;1866), chemist and ink maker, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Heming). He had six brothers and four sisters. The family was Anglican with a Quaker ethos. Gilkes was educated at Shrewsbury School, for which he always felt a deep affection. Elected to a junior studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1868, he gained first classes in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>. He was one of the founders of the Oxford University association football club and a member of the Christ Church cricket eleven. He returned to Shrewsbury as an assistant master in 1873 and remained there until 1885, when he was appointed master of Dulwich College in succession to J. E. C. Welldon.<br>
<br>During the twenty-nine years of his mastership, Gilkes secured Dulwich's position as one of the leading public schools of the period, particularly by its scholarship successes at Oxford and Cambridge. He had unshakeable convictions about education: he thought little of success in examinations or games, and attached prime importance to the moral training of the boys under his care, striving to instil into them a reverence for what is good, an instinct for doing right rather than wrong, and an appreciation of beauty. At first his hesitant manner, apparent mildness, and slight stammer led staff and boys to underrate his moral strength, but they soon learned that behind the diffidence was an iron determination. He was involved in every aspect of the school, knew every boy by name, and had a workload which would have broken a lesser man. Himself a noted classical scholar, he taught classics and divinity to the sixth forms. Plato was one of his favourite authors, and he adopted a Socratic method of moral instruction. He also introduced many of the ideals that he had admired at Shrewsbury: thriving science and engineering sides were established; he founded a school mission on Walworth Road; a rifle corps came into being; and the prefect system was reformed. Sport of all kinds was encouraged, but participation was voluntary. He punished little&#151;a Board of Education inspector's report in 1909 spoke of &#145;his kindly severity&#146;&#151;and he had a natural simplicity which gave him a strong insight into the minds of his charges. Gentle as his manner was, however, his sarcasm could be withering. He once said, defending his habitual attitude of reserve, &#145;You know, I have to be very careful: I was meant by nature for a buffoon.&#146; Many of his ideas were embodied in a series of semi-fictional books, which are virtually unreadable because the message, the paramount importance of goodness, takes precedence over everything else.<br>
<br>As Gilkes grew older his immense stature (he was 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 18 stone), habitual air of gravity, and long beard (&#145;Did he sleep with it inside or outside the bedclothes?&#146;, his younger pupils sometimes wondered) made him a formidable figure. In 1892 he married Millicent Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1922), daughter of B. M. Clarke of Sydenham; they had four sons. In his latter years at Dulwich, Gilkes increasingly suffered from poor health and resigned in the summer of 1914. He incurred temporary unpopularity at the start of the war by a letter to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> criticizing the recourse to arms as &#145;miserable nonsense&#146;. In 1915 he was ordained, serving as curate at St James's, Bermondsey. Christ Church, Oxford, appointed him in 1919 vicar of St Mary Magdalene, Oxford, where he remained until his death of a heart attack at his house, 53 Broad Street, Oxford, on 13 September 1922.<br>
<br>Gilkes's third son, <a name="cosubject_49167"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Herman Gilkes</span>  (1898&#150;1953), followed his father as <span class="occ">master</span> of Dulwich College from 1941 to 1953. He had himself been educated there before going on to Trinity College, Oxford. His first wife, Eleanor Benson, whom he married in 1921, died in 1938, and in the following year he married Kathleen Josephine Gaston Murray (1906&#150;1960). Dulwich was one of the few schools which continued to function in London during the Second World War, and when Christopher Gilkes took over as master it was in a desperate state: no part of the buildings had escaped bombing; the numbers of pupils and the academic level had plummeted; and it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Gilkes restored it to its former eminence with vision and single-minded purpose, though not without raising some hackles. His greatest achievement was the expansion, after the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, of a scheme begun early in the century, under which the fees of particularly clever boys were paid for by their local authority. By 1961 just over 86 per cent came into this category&#151;more than in any comparable school. As a result, not only did the academic level become very high, but the college acquired a rare classlessness, enabling many children from deprived backgrounds to receive a first-class education which would otherwise have been denied them. Christopher Gilkes died of a heart attack at Nolton Haven, Pembrokeshire, on 2 September 1953.<br>
