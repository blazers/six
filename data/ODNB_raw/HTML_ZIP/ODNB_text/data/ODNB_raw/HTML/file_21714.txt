<span class="headword">Pearson,  Hugh Nicholas</span>  (1776&#150;1856), <span class="occ">dean of Salisbury</span>, only son of Hugh Pearson, was born at Lymington, Hampshire, and matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 16 July 1796. He graduated BA in 1800, MA in 1803, and DD as &#145;grand compounder&#146; in 1821. On 13 September 1803 he married Sarah Maria Elliott (1781&#150;1858), eldest daughter of Charles and Sarah Ann Elliott of Clapham, Surrey. Pearson noted in his autobiography his attraction to her &#145;profile, shaded by a profusion of beautiful hair, inclining to auburn&#146;. Both Pearson and his wife had connections with the Clapham sect of evangelicals.<br>
<br>In 1807 Pearson won the prize of &pound;500 offered by Claudius Buchanan for the best essay on missions in Asia, and his work was printed at Oxford with the title <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Propagation of Christianity in Asia</span> (1808). The interest thus aroused in Christian missionary enterprise in Asia prompted Pearson to undertake in 1817 his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Rev. Claudius Buchanan</span> (2 vols.), dedicated to William Wilberforce; and in 1834 he produced a biography of greater interest, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the life and correspondence of the Rev. Christian Frederick Swartz, to which is prefixed a sketch of the history of Christianity in India</span>. This reached a third edition in 1839 and was translated into German by C. P. Blumhardt in Basel, in 1846.<br>
<br>After ordination Pearson was curate to the evangelicals Richard Cecil and John Venn. In 1822 he was appointed vicar of St Helen's, Abingdon, with Radley and Drayton chapelries, and in 1823 he was appointed dean of Salisbury and a domestic chaplain to George IV. He resigned his deanery in 1846 and died at Sonning in Berkshire on 17 November 1856. During the last years of his life he lived mainly with his fourth son, <a href="#cosubject_21714">Hugh [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_21709"></a><span class="headword">Charles Buchanan Pearson</span>  (1807&#150;1881)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Elmdon, Warwickshire, graduated BA from Oriel College, Oxford, with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1828. He took orders in 1830, and in November 1838 became rector of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, where he became friendly with the first Lord Lytton. Besides a paper entitled &#145;Hymns and hymn-writers&#146;, contributed to <span class="italic">Oxford Essays for 1858</span>, and <span class="italic">Latin Translations of English Hymns</span> (1862), he published <span class="italic">Sequences from the Sarum Missal, with English Translations</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">A Lost Chapter in the History of Bath</span> (1877). He was a competent hymnist. His wife was Harriet Elizabeth Pinkerton; they had two boys. He died at home, 2 Catharine Place, Bath, on 7 January 1881, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The dean's second son, William Henley Pearson (1813&#150;1883), assumed in 1865 the additional name of Jervis [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14798/', "Jervis, William Henley Pearson-")</script>]. Another son, Henry Hugo, changed his surname to Pierson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22239/', "Pierson, Henry Hugo")</script>].<br>
<br>The fourth son, <a name="cosubject_21714"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Pearson</span>  (1817&#150;1882)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 25 June 1817, and graduated MA from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1841. He was in the same year appointed vicar of Sonning in Berkshire, a preferment which he held until his death. He was rural dean of Henley-on-Thames from 1864 to 1874, and of Sonning from 1874 to 1876; he was appointed chaplain to the bishop of Manchester in 1870, was created a canon of Windsor in 1876, and, on the death of his closest friend, A. P. Stanley, became deputy clerk of the closet to the queen.<br>
<br>By nature excessively retiring, and undogmatic to the extreme limits of latitudinarianism, Pearson was a notable figure within the church; while, outside it, his character endeared him to people of every rank in life. He was an excellent preacher, but would not allow his sermons to be printed; and though he had an extraordinary knowledge of literature, he never dreamed for a moment of becoming an author. Much of his emotional life centred on A. P. Stanley. He frequently accompanied Stanley abroad, and was with him in Italy just before Stanley's marriage and his decision to accept the deanery of Westminster in 1863; he was present at Stanley's deathbed on 18 July 1881. He declined an invitation to succeed Stanley in the deanery at Westminster, on the ground that he wished to remain what he had always been&#151;a private person. He died at Sonning, unmarried, on 13 April 1882, and was buried in Sonning churchyard, on 18 April. There is a memorial to him in that church.<br>
