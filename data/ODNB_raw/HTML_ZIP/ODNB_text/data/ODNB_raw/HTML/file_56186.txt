<span class="headword">Frece, Sir  (Abraham) Walter  de</span>  (1870&#150;1935), <span class="occ">music-hall entrepreneur and politician</span>, was born on 7 October 1870 at 90 Salisbury Street, Everton, Liverpool, the eldest son of Henry de Frece, music-hall manager, and his wife, Marian Rowe. He was born into a prominent Liverpool theatrical family and although, after completing his education at Liverpool Institute and in Brussels, he was initially apprenticed to an architect, he ultimately followed all three of his brothers into the theatre. Jack and Ben became music-hall managers and Lauri was an actor.<br>
<br>De Frece wrote songs for many top music-hall performers, including Dan Leno, for whom he wrote &#145;The Shopwalker&#146;, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36523/', "Vesta Tilley (1864&#150;1952)")</script>. He married the latter on 16 August 1890: her real name was Matilda Alice Powles, and she was the daughter of Henry William Powles, comedian. Vesta Tilley specialized in male roles, including Burlington Bertie. They had no children.<br>
<br>It was as a music-hall manager and company director that de Frece had his greatest success. His music-hall interests expanded rapidly during the 1890s and especially after the turn of the century, and by 1909 he owned or controlled around fifteen theatres, mainly located in northern industrial towns. He was one of the first music-hall entrepreneurs to appreciate the opportunities presented by the rapidly expanding leisure market in seaside resorts and also controlled a number of theatres on the south coast.<br>
<br>In 1910 de Frece went into partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56176/', "Sir Alfred Butt")</script>, through the formation of the Variety Theatres Controlling Company Limited (VTCC). This merger provided de Frece with access to the lucrative metropolitan market and, he hoped, with the opportunity to resist the spiralling wage demands of variety performers. It also constituted the first real challenge to the predominance of Moss Empires (with whom de Frece had been briefly allied during 1909) within the music-hall industry. After the conclusion of a &#145;triple alliance&#146; between the VTCC, Charles Gulliver (of the London Theatres of Varieties Limited), and Oswald Stoll in 1912, de Frece became one of the most powerful men in the music-hall business.<br>
<br>During the First World War, de Frece organized theatrical and cinematic entertainments for the troops and to raise money for wounded veterans. In 1918 he was appointed a trustee of the King's Fund for Disabled Officers and Men and in 1919 he was knighted in recognition of his war work. After the war de Frece and Vesta Tilley withdrew from active involvement in the music-hall business. In 1919 de Frece sold his interest in the VTCC to Charles Gulliver, although he remained chairman of the company. In the same year he floated the Alliance Film Company.<br>
<br>Increasingly, however, de Frece and his wife dedicated themselves to public life. He was elected the Unionist MP for Ashton under Lyne in February 1920, his success in this contest being widely attributed largely to his wife's ability to mobilize the newly enfranchised female electorate. As <span class="italic">The Times</span> (14 February 1920, 15) noted, &#145;the most significant fact of the election is the further example it has supplied of the influence of woman in politics and the power of the women's vote.&#146; De Frece stood down as the representative for Ashton under Lyne after being sued by an unsuccessful Labour candidate whom he branded as a Bolshevik sympathizer, but was immediately re-elected to represent Blackpool. He continued in parliament until 1931, when he retired on account of the ill health of his wife. While an MP, de Frece championed the cause of the theatrical business. He campaigned vigorously for the abolition of the entertainments tax imposed during the First World War, and in 1924 was elected founding chairman of the House of Commons entertainment industry committee. He served as a deputy lieutenant of Berkshire, and was also honorary colonel of the 9th battalion of the Manchester regiment.<br>
<br>Sir Walter and Lady de Frece retired to Monte Carlo, where they lived until his death from pneumonia and a fever on 7 January 1935 at the Park Palace. His recreations included racing, golf, and motoring, and he cultivated a debonair image, dressing in the fashion of &#145;a man about town rather than one of large business enterprises&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 8 Jan 1935). He was survived by his wife.<br>
