<span class="headword">Hughes,  Margaret Patricia</span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">writer on cricket</span>, was born on 1 October 1919 at 5 Beach Houses, Margate, Kent, the daughter of Arthur Hubert Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1944), pianoforte ironmonger, and his wife, Dorothy Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Townsend. She had three brothers and it was from them that she was infected by the cricket virus during games played in the back garden of their house. She does not appear to have sought to play more seriously as an adult, perhaps slightly surprisingly since the 1930s saw a growth in interest in playing the game among young middle-class women. After leaving school at seventeen she took a job in the advertising department of the <span class="italic">Star</span> newspaper in London, the only woman in the company of a number of men who, as she later wrote, &#145;were as amusing as they were difficult to deal with&#146;  (<span class="italic">All on a Summer's Day</span>, 37). At least she got to see the cricket scores before the general public. During the MCC tour of Australia in 1936&#150;7 she and her brothers took turns to find out the latest test scores broadcast on BBC radio from 3 a.m. and tuned in to the ball-by-ball commentary that began from 7.30 a.m. before catching their trains into London. Walter Hammond and Patsy Hendren were her cricketing heroes and Lord's her Valhalla. She saw Hendren's last appearance for Middlesex&#151;he was forty-eight&#151;and found it an emotionally powerful experience.<br>
<br>In 1941 Hughes joined the Women's Royal Naval Service (the Wrens), and spent a good part of 1944&#150;5 on a posting to the United States. She found herself impressed both by the east coast and by the &#145;marvellous hospitality&#146; but puzzled by the national fetish for hygiene and hot water. Demobilized at the end of April 1946, she spent much of her two months' leave at Lord's, her one disappointment being that it was one of the coldest and wettest summers on record. She later wrote that her passion for cricket was so intense that she determined to make it her central life interest. She would mark time through each winter and save enough money to see her through the cricket season. &#145;I wouldn't be hurting anyone &hellip; the country wasn't having to bear the brunt of my unemployment and I wouldn't be fretting in an office from May to September, wondering how events were shaping up at Lords&#146;  (<span class="italic">All on a Summer's Day</span>, 69). She found a job on the editorial staff of <span class="italic">Queen</span> magazine; she was one of three, her appointment assisted by the fact that the editor's secretary had also been in the Wrens.<br>
<br>It is not clear how or when Hughes met the music critic and cricket correspondent of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30898/', "Sir (John Frederick) Neville Cardus (1888&#150;1975)")</script>, but there is no doubt that they became intimate friends, so much so that she became known as his &#145;cricket wife&#146;, as distinguished from his &#145;music wife&#146;, Else Mayer-Lismann. It was to Hughes that Cardus turned in 1949 when he was suffering from writer's block and he also wrote the foreword for her semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">All on a Summer's Day</span> (1953), possibly the first book on cricket not written by a man. Cardus must have helped her to obtain a place at cricket's exclusively male table. But that she was not lacking in self-belief is shown by her success in persuading the tough proprietor of the <span class="italic">Sydney Daily Telegraph</span>, Frank Packer, to allow her to cover the 1954&#150;5 test series between Australia and England. She was rewarded by a stunning English victory which had seemed unlikely after defeat by an innings in the first test. She wrote about the series in her second book, <span class="italic">The Long Hop</span> (1955), described by John Arlott in his <span class="italic">Wisden</span> review as &#145;the book of an enthusiast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1954, 976). She did not write another book but after the death of Cardus in 1975 became his literary executor and edited several anthologies of his writings, including <span class="italic">What is Music</span> (1977), <span class="italic">A Cardus for all Seasons</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Cardus on the Ashes</span> (1989). She took upon herself the role of guardian of his reputation.<br>
<br>Cricket is a game in which style is often thought more important than effectiveness. Cardus valued players for their style and character as much as their ability, and Hughes seems to have shared this preference. On the nawab of Pataudi, for example, &#145;you could look forward for weeks&#146; to an innings by him, &#145;knowing you would see a true stylist&#146;  (<span class="italic">All on a Summer's Day</span>, 60). Lala Amarnath bowling off the wrong foot had &#145;the same effect on me as the scraping of a rusty file&#146;  (ibid., 62), while Joe Hardstaff was a &#145;Cyrano de Bergerac at the crease, erect and lithe and quick of foot, with his bat as a rapier, he makes exquisite poetry as he thrusts and parries&#146;  (ibid., 63). Grace and charm were important to her in cricketers, especially batsmen, and she spotted it in the eighteen-year-old Colin Cowdrey, whose &#145;45 runs in that style is good enough for me&#146;  (ibid., 65).<br>
<br>Hughes was a true pioneer in a very male world and by the time of her death few others had followed where she led. She never lost her passion for cricket. Only in the final two years of her life did she stop going to watch cricket at Lord's. Having lived latterly at Melcombe Regis Court, Weymouth Street, London, she died on 30 January 2005 at St Mary's Hospital, Westminster, of pneumonia. She never married. Her brother David survived her.<br>
