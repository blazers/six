<span class="headword">Connor,  Kenneth</span>  (1918&#150;1993), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at 8 Leconfield Road, Highbury, London, on 6 June 1918, the son of John Francis Connor, a naval petty officer, and his wife, Ellen Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campling. From the age of two he was encouraged to perform in concert parties that his father organized. This experience, and later spells in revue, convinced him that he wanted to become an actor. He enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1933, before going on to win the gold medal as outstanding student on his graduation in 1936. He made his professional d&eacute;but the same year in J. M. Barrie's final play, <span class="italic">The Boy David</span>, with Elisabeth Bergner at Her Majesty's Theatre. His film d&eacute;but followed in 1939, a small speaking part in a Flora Robson vehicle, <span class="italic">Poison Pen</span>. During the Second World War he served in the Middlesex regiment, though he continued to perform both in ENSA revues and for the Stars in Battledress play section, appearing as a gunner in the latter's inaugural production, Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">Flare Path</span>, directed by Edith Evans. On 20 October 1942, at Morpeth, Connor married Margaret Irene (<i>b</i>. 1919), daughter of Randolph Churchill Knox, miner, of Morpeth. They had a son, Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1955), who appeared with him in a number of films.<br>
<br>After the war Connor was invited to join the Bristol Old Vic where he stayed from 1945 to 1947. It was here that he played the Fool in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> with William Devlin as the King, a performance he remained proud of for the rest of his life. The production transferred to the Embassy Theatre in London, and where a reviewer remarked that Connor &#145;conjures up, with the simplest possible means, the compassion one feels for the lost&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 May 1947). He then moved on to the Old Vic Company in London for the 1947&#150;8 season.<br>
<br>Conner's film career, stymied by the war, continued in 1950 with a small part in the now forgotten farce <span class="italic">Never Say Die</span>. More important was his work in radio. Connor had an extraordinary talent for manipulating his voice, and radio became a favoured medium, where he proved the perfect comic stooge. He had worked in radio before the war, performing a sketch with Syd Walker in a 1939 episode of the groundbreaking comedy <span class="italic">Band Waggon</span>. But now his vocal talents were fully recognized, and he became known as the &#145;Man of Many Voices&#146; while working with Ted Ray on <span class="italic">Ray's a Laugh</span>, 1953&#150;61. Other important radio appearances include Eric Barker's <span class="italic">Just Fancy</span> (1953&#150;7) and multiple characters (including a parrot) for <span class="italic">Meet the Huggetts</span> (1953&#150;5). His association with Peter Sellers, which had begun on <span class="italic">Ray's a Laugh</span>, continued on television through Spike Milligan's <span class="italic">The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d</span> (1956), <span class="italic">A Show Called Fred</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">Son of Fred</span> (1956). Connor's verbal virtuosity also enabled him to stand in for Sellers as well as Harry Secombe in separate episodes of <span class="italic">The Goon Show</span>. His radio catchphrases &#145;Do You Mind?&#146; and &#145;Oh Mate!&#146; would later find their way into many a <span class="italic">Carry On</span> script.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Carry On</span> films made Connor a household name. The series ran to thirty-one outings, and Connor appeared in seventeen, from the opener, <span class="italic">Carry On Sergeant</span>, in 1958, to the last genuine entrant, <span class="italic">Carry On Emmannuelle</span>, in 1978. As well as being a key member of the <span class="italic">Carry On</span> team, he appeared in many of their stage and television offshoots. In the early films he was generally cast as a nerve-wracked romantic often with delusions of grandeur; in the later ones as an ageing, somewhat seedy rou&eacute;. However, two of his finest films were outside the series, though the first was made by the same team. This was <span class="italic">Watch Your Stern</span> (1960), in which Connor excels as a humble seaman who is incapable of making practical use of his electronics expertise. The second was a fine horror comedy, <span class="italic">What a Carve Up!</span> (1961), an admittedly hackneyed story of relatives mortally threatened as they await the reading of a will, but one which is brought to life by a timid Connor and a not-so-timid Sid James.<br>
<br>During the <span class="italic">Carry On</span> years he also voiced a chimpanzee for the PG Tips adverts and was principal voice artist for two Gerry Anderson puppet series: <span class="italic">Torchy the Battery Boy</span> (1958&#150;9) and <span class="italic">Four Feather Falls</span> (1960). After what was arguably his finest <span class="italic">Carry On</span> moment&#151;<span class="italic">Carry on Cleo</span>, released in 1964, in which he is the timid inventor of the square wheel who becomes Julius Caesar's protector after being mistaken for an invincible warrior&#151;Connor took a six-year break from the series to concentrate on the theatre. In 1963 he was cast as Hysterium in the West End premi&egrave;re of Stephen Sondheim's <span class="italic">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</span> with Frankie Howerd. This was a huge success, running for 762 performances, after which it went on a national tour under Connor's direction. He also had a long run as King Louis XIII at Drury Lane in <span class="italic">The Four Musketeers</span> with Harry Secombe during 1967 and 1968.<br>
<br>In 1984 Connor gained the affection of a new generation in the role of Alfonse for the second series of <span class="italic">'Allo 'Allo</span>, David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd's beautifully scripted Second World War French Resistance slapstick comedy. Connor is a joy as a prosperous funeral director with a &#145;dicky ticker&#146; in hot pursuit of Carmen Silvera's bar owner. He stayed with the series until it ended in 1992.<br>
<br>Connor's later years also saw him play a recurring character in <span class="italic">Hi-de-Hi!</span> (1986&#150;8), a memorable guest spot as a pompous, dandyish actor in <span class="italic">Blackadder III</span> (1987), and, in an episode which was only screened after his death, a character part in <span class="italic">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</span> (1994) with Jeremy Brett. He was appointed MBE in 1991. He died at his home, Home Oaks, South Hill Avenue, Harrow on the Hill, on 28 November 1993, following a short battle with cancer.<br>
