<span class="headword">Lucas,  Anthony</span>  (1633&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Jesuit and experimental philosopher</span>, was born on 18 October 1633 in co. Durham. From about 1650 he studied at the Jesuit school at St Omer in Flanders, and he entered the Society of Jesus in May 1662. The next year he joined the English Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge, and in 1672 became professor of theology there. Li&egrave;ge professors boasted expertise in mathematical and experimental subjects they judged fashionable in England, especially at the Royal Society. In the 1670s Lucas maintained contacts with the society's secretary, Henry Oldenburg, via the ex-Jesuit controversialist and St Omer graduate Robert Pugh, and through the virtuoso John Aubrey, who also proposed to his friend Lucas the making of French translations of English scholarly texts.<br>
<br>Lucas became involved with the Royal Society after Isaac Newton's doctrine of colours was attacked in September 1674 by the elderly Francis Line, mathematics professor at Li&egrave;ge. Newton passed sunlight from a small window-hole into a darkened room then transversely and symmetrically through a prism near the hole, making an oblong spectrum on a distant wall. He claimed that the spectrum's shape showed that rays had intrinsically different refrangibilities. Line reckoned such a shape could only be obtained were the sky cloudy and the prism far from the hole and parallel to the light. After Line's death in November 1675 his student John Gascoines insisted Line had successfully performed many trials before witnesses at the college. In January 1676 Oldenburg sent to Li&egrave;ge Newton's instructions on orienting the prism and darkening the room, and in April organized a Royal Society demonstration of the prism trial.<br>
<br>In May 1676 Lucas joined the fight, interpreting the Royal Society's demonstration as a confirmation of Line's reports. He reproduced a slightly less lengthy oblong spectrum, but his views of spectral colours, coloured silks, and paper discs through lenses and prisms suggested coloured rays did not intrinsically experience different refractions. Lucas's letter on the subject was published in the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in September 1676. Newton worried about the difference in spectral length but ignored Lucas's other trials, which concerned phenomena Newton had treated in writings of the early 1670s. He wanted Lucas to check prism angles and concave sides, measure spectral lengths, and attend to Newton's crucial experiment, in which well-separated rays were subjected to a second refraction to show each ray's constant refrangibility. In October, Lucas made further trials to challenge intrinsic differences in refrangibility, denied the logical force of the crucial experiment, and appealed to the precedent of Robert Boyle, preferring accumulation of relevant experiments to a single decisive trial. Newton reacted with fury, again demanding that Lucas report on prism size and quality. In early 1677 Lucas conceded that the difference in spectral length, a matter he judged trivial, was perhaps due to his prism's concave sides, glass quality, and the time of day, but repeated that extrinsic factors could explain colours' different refractions.<br>
<br>At the end of 1677 Newton, Aubrey, and Robert Hooke, the Royal Society's new secretary, discussed publication of the optical debate, as Lucas also wanted. In early 1678 Lucas sent copies of his previous letters via Pugh and Hooke, adding that his prism angles were slightly smaller than Newton used and that he had difficulty getting good glass. In Newton's final response to Lucas, sent via Aubrey and Pugh in March 1678, he explained away all Lucas's trials of 1676. Lucas's prism had too small an angle, he had confused mixed with simple colours, and he believed that microscope glasses behaved like fine lenses, ignored differences in angles of incidence, and assumed the crucial experiment was supposed to show that different colours had different refrangibilities, whereas, Newton now claimed, the experiment had nothing to do with colour. Lucas sent Aubrey further letters in the summer of 1678, but Newton withdrew from debate and publication, charging Lucas with conspiracy to embroil him and save Jesuit honour. Lucas, responsible for redirecting Newton's optical project and for some of Newton's anguish about public controversies, has occasionally been treated sympathetically, notably in Johann von Goethe's late eighteenth-century history of optics.<br>
<br>After the end of the debate with Newton, Lucas's English connections were disrupted. In the winter of 1678&#150;9 Jesuits at St Omer were implicated in the Popish Plot, and Pugh, Lucas's contact, died in a London gaol. In 1684 Lucas took part in debates at Ghent about a Jesuit history of the plot. Between 1680 and 1685 he was rector of the Jesuit school for novices at Watten, near St Omer. In 1686 Li&egrave;ge seminarians established a pilgrimage chapel in honour of the Virgin Mary, and it has been suggested that Lucas composed a manuscript account of her life and death. He achieved promotion as James II's regime began encouraging English Jesuits during 1687 and Flemish colleges grew. In March 1687 Lucas became rector of the Li&egrave;ge College, and in October rector of the English College at Rome. In August 1693 he was made provincial superior of the English Jesuits, but he died of fever at the age of fifty-nine, at Watten, on 3 October 1693.<br>
