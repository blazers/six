<span class="headword">Webb,  John Richmond</span>  (1667&#150;1724), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Rodbourne Cheney, Wiltshire, on 26 December 1667, the third, but second surviving, son of Colonel Edmund Richmond alias Webb (<i>c</i>.1639&#150;1705) and his first wife, Jane (1649&#150;1669), daughter of John Smith of Tidworth, Hampshire, and previously of St Mary Aldermanbury, London. His family had acquired the name &#145;Richmond alias Webb&#146; from the marriage of William Richmond to Alice Webb about 1430 and this form was typically used in family legal documents including Webb's own will. The family had owned the manor of Rodbourne Cheney since the reign of Edward VI.<br>
<br>Webb's father had served as a colonel of a Wiltshire militia regiment from 1680 to 1688 and was elected eight times, between 1679 and 1695, as MP for Cricklade, Wiltshire, and then three times in 1701&#150;2 for the nearby borough of Ludgershall. In 1683 Edmund became gentleman usher to Prince George of Denmark on his marriage to the future Queen Anne. In 1684 Charles II pardoned Edmund and his cousin Henry St John, father of the first Viscount Bolingbroke, following the death of Sir William Estcourt in a duel. Edmund Richmond alias Webb commanded his militia regiment during Monmouth's rising in June and July 1685, but later that year lost his local and militia offices and was temporarily unseated in parliament. His court and political connections served as the basis for his two surviving sons' careers. The elder son, Thomas Richmond alias Webb (1662/3&#150;1731), was educated at the Middle Temple and called to the bar in 1689, served as recorder at Devizes (1697&#150;1707), clerk of alienations, solicitor to Prince George (<i>c</i>.1692&#150;1708), and serjeant-at-law of the Middle Temple (1705&#150;31). He was elected MP for Calne in 1685, for Cricklade in 1702, and for Devizes in 1710.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer"></a>Early military career</h2>Webb commented that he had served in the army since the age of sixteen. This would place his entry into military service during the last few days of 1683 or in 1684 and clearly differentiates him from a John Webb who had served in Virginia before being promoted to lieutenant in the first guards under Marlborough in the Low Countries in 1691. On 2 August 1685 he received a commission as cornet in the Queen's regiment of dragoon guards (later, the 3rd hussars). On 20 November 1688 at Wincanton he was one of the 120 horsemen under Patrick Sarsfield who encountered a party of 25 soldiers from the prince of Orange's Anglo-Dutch brigade. Webb was seriously wounded in the engagement. On 29 November he was promoted to captain, replacing Captain Thomas Pownall in the Queen's regiment of dragoons. He remained in the army following the revolution, and on 1 April 1689 was posted as captain of the 1st foot guards. On 3 February 1690 he married Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1711), daughter and coheir of Sir John Borlase and widow of Sir Richard Ashley (<i>d</i>. 1687) of Everley, Wiltshire. The couple had seven children. In 1692 he purchased the land and building that would become the nucleus for his future Wiltshire estate at Ludgershall.<br>
<br>In June 1693 Webb was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of foot and, two and a half years later, undoubtedly assisted by his father's connections, he became colonel of Princess Anne's (8th) regiment of foot, a post he retained until 1715. In January 1695 he entered parliament as MP for Ludgershall, for which he was returned successively in twelve elections until 1713. Although duelling was banned, army officers were continually involved in such incidents during the reign of William III. Like his father, John Webb was not immune to the impulse and, in 1697, both he and his opponent, Captain Mardike, seriously wounded one another in a duel. After serving in England for the entire period of the Nine Years' War, Webb's regiment was ordered to Ireland in February 1698. Webb arrived in Dublin in early March and remained in Ireland for more than three years, until he and his regiment moved to the Netherlands in June 1701.<h2>
<a name="WaroftheSpanishSuccession"></a>War of the Spanish Succession</h2>During the first campaign in the War of the Spanish Succession, Webb served under Marlborough in the combined Anglo-Dutch field army during the offensive against the towns along the River Meuse, distinguishing himself at the storming of Venlo in September 1702. On his return to England following the frustrating campaign of 1703, he was promoted to brigadier (1 January 1704). While sitting in parliament in this period Webb, it became clear, had joined his kinsman Henry St John (later Viscount Bolingbroke) in the political camp of Robert Harley. The following summer, after a long wait for favourable weather at Harwich to get back to the Low Countries for the 1704 campaigning season, Webb with two other general officers, John, Baron Cutts, and Richard Ingoldsby, carried money for the army, travelled to Frankfurt, and then joined Marlborough in the camp at Burgheim on 15 July. On 13 August Webb was with the troops that encircled the Bavarian village of Blindheim (Blenheim) and prevented the French force in the village from escaping across the Danube. In the following year he distinguished himself in battle when Marlborough forced the lines of Brabant near Heylissem and Elixhem on 17&#150;18 July 1705. During the next campaign Webb commanded in the left centre of the English lines at the battle of Ramillies on 23 May 1706. In September, when the Dutch promoted several of their brigadiers for the action at Ramillies, Marlborough successfully persuaded Queen Anne to promote both Webb, as the army's senior brigadier, and John Campbell, second duke of Argyll, to the rank of major-general, and to backdate their commissions to 1 June.<br>
<br>In March 1708, on the news of James Stuart's attempt to invade Scotland, Webb's regiment was one of those embarked at Ostend and sent to Tynemouth. Not landed, they lay off the coast for several weeks and then returned to Ostend. On 11 July Webb participated in the battle of Oudenarde and in the weeks after the battle was one of the commanders in the force of twelve battalions that raided Picardy. Near Lens, Webb's detachment encountered a French force of eight hundred cavalry and pursued them into the town. An anonymous poet described the events in 322 lines of couplet verse that included a single reference to Webb, &#145;like Paris handsome, and like Hector brave&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Battel of Audenard: a Poem</span>, l. 257).<br>
<br>Early in September Webb was recalled to take part in the siege of Lille. The French were bringing in reinforcements to threaten the allied communication lines, and supplies for the besieging forces were running low. The only available route for allied supplies was the road from Ostend. A convoy of some 700 or 800 wagons, filled with two weeks of supplies, including substantial quantities of powder and shot, left Ostend on 28 September 1708, escorted by 2500 men. Webb was assigned, with a force of some 4000 men drawn from the British, Dutch, Prussian, Hanoverian, and Danish armies and three squadrons of dragoons, to cover the convoy as it passed through Brabant. As the wagons reached Koekelare, Webb learned that French forces under the comte de Lamothe, based at Bruges with some 22,000 men, had been sighted a mile and a half to the east at Ichtegem. Webb advanced towards the convoy and, accompanied by Count Nassau-Woudenberg and 150 cavalry, he personally reconnoitred and selected an advantageous position where he could intercept Lamothe's force, at least twice the size of his own. Close to the castle of Wijnendale, 15 miles from Ostend, Webb positioned ten battalions in three lines across an opening on a wooded slope, with one regiment posted in the coppice to the left, two additional platoons nearby facing the plain, and seven platoons placed in the wood to the right. He had barely finished this placement when Lamothe approached and opened fire. The French had marched to within fifteen paces of the allied right flank when the battalions that Webb had hidden in the wood opened fire and forced the French left wing into its centre. Despite hostile fire from Prussian forces the French continued onwards, driving two allied regiments into confusion, but, with support from Albemarle's regiment of Swiss, Webb and Count Nassau were able to gain enough time to bring three more regiments to bear. With such deep support, the French tried again to penetrate the allied line, but the allied troops were able to advance and force the two French wings into their centre; the confusion thus created forced the French to retire, but the allies continued to fire at long range. Major-General William Cadogan arrived on the scene shortly after the engagement began, but Webb declined his offer to charge the enemy with his two squadrons of horse, thinking they would be too much at risk when the enemy was protecting its retreat with its own horse. Corporal Matthew Bishop, who had fought with Webb in his own regiment, later recalled that Webb<blockquote>was an old and experienced general and a man that knew every part of the country, without which he could not have known how to dispose of his men. And this plainly appears from his beautiful disposition of his troops. (<span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span>, 189)</blockquote>When the two-hour battle of Wijnendale was over, the allies had lost 912 killed and wounded to an estimated 3000 or 4000 French. The allied army maintained its position on the field until two the following morning, and so the convoy was able to pass.<h2>
<a name="BreachwithMarlborough"></a>Breach with Marlborough</h2>Having witnessed the victory Cadogan returned to Marlborough with the news and Marlborough immediately sent his congratulations to Webb, writing on 29 September 1708 that this success &#145;must be attributed chiefly to your good conduct and resolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Dispatches of John Churchill, First Duke of Marlborough, from 1702 to 1712</span>, ed. G. Murray, 1845, 4.424). In reporting the victory to Godolphin, Marlborough wrote:<blockquote>Webb and Cadogan have on this occasion as they always do, behaved themselves extremely well. The success of this vigorous action is in a good measure owing to them. If they had not succeeded, and our convoy had been lost, the consequence must have been the raising the siege the next day. (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 2.1106)</blockquote>Marlborough's choice of words, while well intentioned, seemed to give equal credit to Cadogan, and appeared in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. Outraged, Webb immediately protested and requested that Marlborough send him to London to report in person on his victory to Anne. Agreeable, Marlborough privately advised Godolphin &#145;that when she has a position this winter, he [Webb] may be sure of being a lieutenant-general, which really this action makes his due&#146;  (ibid., 2.1117). On 18 October Anne received Webb with warm approval at Kensington and the following day he reported to Godolphin at Newmarket. During his visit to London, Webb provided his own detailed account of the battle to the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> (23 September 1708). In conversation with Godolphin he made it clear that he would not return to the Low Countries without his commission as lieutenant-general in hand. Dismayed that the country would lose Webb's military talent for the remainder of the campaign, and also that the incident might fuel the rising political criticism of Marlborough, Godolphin suggested that he be promised the first available governorship. Captain Robert Parker reflected:<blockquote>Webb very deservedly acquired great honour and reputation by the gallant action; but then he spoiled it all by making it the subject of his conversation on all occasions. This should have been left to fame, which seldom fails to give the hero his due praise, and does him infinitely greater honour than his own vain boasting. (Chandler, 80)</blockquote>The tory politicians and writers seized upon Webb's situation. In December 1708 Sir Thomas Hanmer moved the thanks of the Commons for Webb and was amply seconded by William Bromley. This honour for Webb, as Godolphin clearly saw, was &#145;not so much out of any real kindness to him, but that one of their [party political] leaders might take the handle to show as much malice as he could to [Marlborough]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 2.1175). Malicious gossip mongers and political hacks even went so far as to suggest that a jealous Marlborough had offered a bribe payable if the enemy had captured the allied convoy.<br>
<br>Promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 January 1709, Webb became the only tory general MP among the twenty-one officers who became major-general or lieutenant-general in the period May 1707 to January 1709; in contrast, six generals, who were sitting whig MPs, were promoted. Webb returned to the Low Countries and, in March, the queen granted him a pension of &pound;1000 per year for ninety-nine years from Post Office funds during her own lifetime, until such time as the government could provide him a governorship or other appointment. At the battle of Malpalquet in September 1709 Webb was initially reported killed but was, in fact, very seriously wounded, and disabled for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Webb continued to believe that Marlborough had tried to deny him credit for the victory at Wijnendale and strongly supported the duke's tory critics. During the summer of 1710 it was reported that he contemplated standing for parliament in Westminster, against the whig general James Stanhope. In August 1710, however, the new government under Robert Harley offered him the post of captain and governor of the Isle of Wight, a position that he held until 1715.<br>
<br>In parliament during January 1711 Webb carried on the whig proposal, echoed in parliament since December 1707, that British forces in Spain should be strengthened by sending the best and most experienced regiments from the Netherlands. His views on this occasion, however, were not seconded. One of Jonathan Swift's <span class="italic">Letters to Stella</span>, dated 11 April 1711, reports that Webb had come to call. &#145;He goes with a crutch and a stick, yet was forced to come up two pair of stairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works</span>, 2.160). On 27 June 1711 Webb's wife, Henrietta, died; she was buried at Ludgershall, where he had just begun to enlarge the original Biddesden House, including a heraldic carving on its curved pediment and classic trophies of arms over the pediments. He also installed a church bell that had been taken at Lille and laid out the trees and bushes as they had been at Wijnendale. Concerned about his future, Webb proposed several alternatives to Harley, now earl of Oxford, to regularize his financial position, including the governorship of Chelsea College or the colonelcy of the Coldstream Guards. Webb's career survived Marlborough's dismissal, and on 11 June 1712, six months after James Butler, second duke of Ormond, was appointed Marlborough's successor, he was commissioned lieutenant-general and commander-in-chief of all land forces in England. The meaning of this appointment raises questions, since Richard Savage, fourth Earl Rivers, was appointed in the following week as commander-in-chief in Britain during Ormond's absence abroad, and Webb's appointment is recorded only in the non-regimental commissions and not, as would be expected, among general officers' commissions. It appears to be a subordinate appointment under Rivers, restricted to England.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerandlegacy"></a>Later career and legacy</h2>In the parliamentary election of 1713 Webb was returned for both Ludgershall in Wiltshire and Newport, Isle of Wight, and he chose the governor's prerogative to sit for the Isle of Wight until the election of 1715. At about this point Webb shifted his political allegiance from Oxford back to his cousin, Bolingbroke, as those two political leaders fought for political supremacy. With the fall in tory fortunes that followed the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Webb was removed as governor of the Isle of Wight and colonel of the 8th foot. However, he was returned to sit for Ludgershall between 1715 and 1724. In November 1718 Webb made his most memorable statement in parliament&#151;one that is sometimes referenced as the basis for providing parliament with documents written only in English. When the secretary of state, James Craggs, laid the texts of newly concluded treaties before the house, some of which were in Latin, an objection was heard. Defending himself, Craggs replied that Latin should not be a language strange to any member of the Commons, whereupon Webb stood up. He declared that:<blockquote>he was not ashamed of his ignorance; that he was never brought up in a University but in the Army ever since he was 16 and had never looked in a grammar since and that he did not understand one word that was read and therefore insisted that they should be turned into English and not be forced to vote for what they did not know. (Hugh Thomas to the duke of Mar, 13 Nov 1718, <span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 7.568)</blockquote>On 20 May 1720 Webb married Anne Skeates, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Borlase, a widow and the sister of his first wife, with whom he had been living for some time. They had three children together, in addition to his previous seven. The first two, Catherine (1716&#150;1730) and Frances (1717&#150;1777), had been born before the marriage; their son, John Richmond Webb (1721&#150;1766), was later of Lincoln's Inn and MP for Bossiney and justice for Glamorgan, Brecon, and Radnor. During the trial of Christopher Layer in November 1722 Webb's name came up in connection with a Jacobite association called &#145;Burford's&#146;. Not long afterwards Webb retired from political life. He died on 5 September 1724 at Biddesden House and was buried, at his direction, in the nearby parish church of Ludgershall, next to his first wife. His widow later married Henry Fowke or Fookes. She died a widow in April 1737 and was buried next to Webb.<br>
<br>Webb's image in literature and history owes much to a collateral family connection. A distant cousin, Colonel Richmond Webb (1715&#150;1785), has a monument in the east transept of Westminster Abbey. In 1776 Colonel Richmond Webb's daughter, Amelia (1758&#150;1810), married William Makepeace Thackeray (1749&#150;1813), the grandfather of the author of the same name. Thackeray was very proud of his Webb family connections and used family information in at least two of his novels. His grandmother Amelia Webb provided the model for Emmy's godmother in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, and the <span class="italic">History of Henry Esmond</span> is the fictional account of an officer who was gazetted to Webb's regiment as a lieutenant in 1704 and served under him in several campaigns. The picture that Thackeray penned of Webb in part 2, chapter 15 of <span class="italic">Henry Esmond</span> was the principal reminder of Webb's military career in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Drawing on a variety of sources, Thackeray dramatically coloured the image of Marlborough's calculated personal animosity in his description of Webb's resentment at Marlborough's official report on Wijnendale published in the <span class="italic">Gazette</span>.<br>
