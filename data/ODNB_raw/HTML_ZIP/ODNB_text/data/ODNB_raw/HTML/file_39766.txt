<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Esten <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bennett; <em>other married name </em>Scott-Waring]</span>,  Harriet Pye</span>  (1761?&#150;1865), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born, according to her death certificate, in May 1761, at Tooting, Surrey, the natural daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22923/', "Admiral Sir Thomas Pye (1708/9&#150;1785)")</script>, and his housekeeper, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2117/', "Anna (or Agnes) Maria Bennett (d. 1808)")</script>. She had a brother, Thomas Pye Bennett, who joined the Royal Navy. In February 1784 Harriet Bennett married Lieutenant James Esten, with whom she had two children. The ill success of her husband in a business venture is said to have prompted her to pursue an independent career as an actress.<br>
<br>Esten received her theatrical instruction from her mother. She made her d&eacute;but at Bristol on 19 June 1786 as Alicia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, and acted regularly throughout the 1786&#150;7 season at Bristol and Bath, where the local press dubbed her &#145;the Bath Abington&#146;. The following summer she joined the company of Richard Daly at Smock Alley, Dublin, where she acted alongside William Holman. In July 1789, while performing in Dublin, she obtained a deed of separation from her husband: Mrs Bennett had agreed to rescue her son-in-law from bankruptcy on condition that he relinquish his wife and children and live abroad.<br>
<br>In January 1790 Harriet Esten took up an engagement with John Jackson in Edinburgh. She made her d&eacute;but as Juliet and &#145;was received as one scarcely inferior to Mrs Siddons or Mrs Jordan&#146;  (Haslewood, 1.6). She then joined the company of Tate Wilkinson at York, where her performance as Shakespeare's Rosalind was received with &#145;violent applause&#146;. Wilkinson recalls how an enamoured theatre critic of York &#145;made the press groan with lavish praises of the Esten&#146;  (Wilkinson, 3.109).<br>
<br>The popularity of Mrs Esten in the provinces resulted in an engagement for the 1790&#150;91 season at Covent Garden. On 20 October 1790 she made her London d&eacute;but, once more playing Rosalind. &#145;She is rather small in stature&#146;, reported one critic, &#145;but well made, with a most eloquent eye and a very expressive countenance. Although she is rather underhung, her face may fairly be pronounced pretty, and her figure engaging. Her voice, in the pathetic tones, resembles that of Mrs Siddons, but is more clear and articulate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woodfall's Register</span>, 21 Oct 1790). Esten performed throughout her first London season &#145;without receiving any salary; but with the indulgence of appearing in whatever characters she chose&#146;  (Gilliland, 2.757). Her first London benefit performance, as Letitia Hardy in Hannah Cowley's <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>, raised &pound;353 18<i>s</i>. Other roles included Indiana in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, Roxalana in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Sultan</span>, and Monimia in Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. Thomas Harris, manager of Covent Garden, under strong pressure from the duke of Clarence and Dorothy Jordan, agreed to re-engage Esten for three further seasons on a salary of &pound;11 a week.<br>
<br>In July 1792 Esten obtained the lease of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, from Stephen Kemble. The theatre patentee, Douglas, eighth duke of Hamilton (1756&#150;1799), with whom Esten had begun an affair, withdrew from Kemble the authority to perform, thereby obliging him to part with the lease, occasioning considerable local controversy. A year later Esten returned the lease to Kemble for a consideration of &pound;200 per year. In May 1794 she retired from Covent Garden. Two months later she gave birth to a daughter by the duke of Hamilton.<br>
<br>In 1797 James Esten returned from the Caribbean with a fortune estimated at &pound;200,000, which he had accumulated while working as a rent collector for Adam Williamson, the British governor of Santo Domingo. He obtained a divorce from his wife in July, although an action brought against the duke of Hamilton for adultery failed in the House of Lords. The duke died on 1 August 1799, leaving Harriet Esten an annuity of &pound;3000. In the winter of 1802 she made a brief reappearance on the Edinburgh stage, where she earned &pound;50 a night.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1812 Esten married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24893/', "Major John Scott-Waring (1747&#150;1819)")</script>, formerly MP for Stockbridge and agent to Warren Hastings. The marriage produced a son, Lieutenant John T. Scott-Waring, and a daughter. Following the death of Major Scott-Waring at their house in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, Esten raised her children alone. She died at her home, 36 Queen's Gate Terrace, Kensington, on 29 April 1865. Notice of her death &#145;at a very advanced age&#146; was carried in <span class="italic">The Times</span> for 2 May 1865. Her death certificate gave her age as 103 years and 11 months. Anne Douglas Hamilton, her daughter by the duke, married Henry Robert, third Baron Rossmore (1792&#150;1860), and died childless in 1844.<br>
