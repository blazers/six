<span class="headword">Dickenson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Welsh]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1868&#150;1954), <span class="occ">trade unionist and suffragist</span>, was born on 28 March 1868 in Borsall Road, Hulme, Manchester, the second of five children of Scot John Welsh, enameller and coach-painter, and his wife, Jane Ferguson. From 1879, when she was eleven years old, until 1895, Sarah Welsh worked in Howarth's mill, a cotton mill in Salford. During these years she became involved in the efforts of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council to organize women workers and by 1889 had become secretary of the small Manchester and Salford Association of Machine, Electrical, and Other Women Workers. When the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade Union Council was set up in 1895, as one of the few working women involved in its launch, Sarah Welsh was appointed one of two full-time organizers. The aims of the council were to work for improved wages and working conditions by encouraging women to join unions which would be able to negotiate on their behalf. In 1896 Sarah married William Roger Dickenson, an iron enameller who had his own bicycle workshop; they had no children.<br>
<br>Sarah Dickenson firmly believed that no improvement in women's working conditions would take place until women, as voters, could influence legislation. This belief was shared by other women textile workers who related their commitment to the extension of the franchise to women to the situation of working women and the wider labour movement. Accordingly she resigned from the Women's Trade Union Council in 1904, when the council decided that support of women's suffrage was outside its remit. As an alternative, Sarah Dickenson and Eva Gore Booth set up the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council with a clear commitment to women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Sarah Dickenson's involvement in the issue of women's suffrage dates from the late 1890s when she became a member of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage (NESWS), an organization modelled closely on the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) set up in 1897 with Millicent Fawcett as its president. Sarah Dickenson took a leading part in its activities, and was closely involved in the 1900&#150;01 campaign to petition women factory workers in support of women's suffrage. When this petition, with almost 30,000 signatures, was presented to the Lancashire MPs at the House of Commons on 8 March 1901, Sarah Dickenson was among the speakers. In 1903 she was a founder member of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Workers Representation Committee, formed to select and support a parliamentary candidate who would campaign for women's suffrage. The NESWS split in 1905 over the issue of targeting factory workers and a number of the executive committee members, including Sarah Dickenson, resigned to set up an alternative society, the National Industrial and Professional Women's Suffrage Society.<br>
<br>Sarah Dickenson worked for women's suffrage at a national as well as a local level. She was employed periodically as a salaried organizer for the NUWSS and took part in several major demonstrations on behalf of women's suffrage. In 1906 she spoke during a large deputation to the prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, on the right of women wage-earners to political enfranchisement.<br>
<br>In 1918 when a limited number of women were granted the vote, the Women's Trade Union Council and the Women's Trade and Labour Council merged to form the women's group of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council. Sarah Dickenson continued to play an active role in the work of the trades council: from 1920 to 1925 she was a member of the council's executive committee, and secretary of the women's group; in 1925 and 1926 she served on the employment exchange committee and the women's housing advisory committee; and she was a member of the war pensions committee and the children's subcommittee. She remained a delegate to the council until 1930, representing the small union of the Machine, Electrical, and other Women Workers.<br>
<br>Sarah Dickenson lived throughout her life in and around Manchester, and in 1931 she was appointed MBE for her services to the city. In 1923 she was appointed a JP, a post she held until 1939. She died on 26 December 1954 at her home, 107 Birch Hall Lane, Rusholme, Manchester, and was cremated at Manchester southern cemetery.<br>
