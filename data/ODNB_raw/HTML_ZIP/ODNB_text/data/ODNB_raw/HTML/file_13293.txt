<span class="headword">Hill,  Robert</span>  (1699&#150;1777), <span class="occ">tailor and religious writer</span>, was born on 11 January 1699 at Miswell, Hertfordshire, the son of poor parents, Robert Hill and Phoebe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clark. His father died within a year of his birth and about five years later his mother married Thomas Robinson, a tailor in Buckingham. Robert was left to the care of his maternal grandmother, at Miswell, and on her removal in 1710 to Tring Grove he became a farmer's boy. Having proved too delicate for this occupation he was apprenticed in 1714 to his stepfather in Buckingham, where the chance acquisition of a grammar at the age of seventeen inspired him with zeal for learning. His first studies were Latin and French, and later he studied Greek and Hebrew.<br>
<br>Hill married in 1721 and became a schoolmaster in 1724, on finding his increasing family hard to support. He ran his school, which had more than fifty scholars, for six or seven years. In 1728 his wife died; in 1730 he married a rich widow but she was such a spendthrift that he left her in 1732 and travelled as a tailor and stay-maker. Having heard of his second wife's death, about 1741, he returned to Buckingham in 1744 and married for the third time in 1747.<br>
<br>About this date Hill came to the notice of a neighbouring clergyman, who encouraged him to write. Hill was also introduced by him to Joseph Spence, who wrote an account of Hill's life in <span class="italic">Parallel in the manner of Plutarch, between a most celebrated man of Florence, and one, scarce ever heard of, in England</span> (1757). This tract compares Hill with the Florentine writer Antonio Magliabechi and was included in Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces on Various Subjects, by Several Authors</span> (1761). A long list of benefactors at the end of Spence's tract shows that Hill received substantial assistance, but in 1775 he was again in difficulties. In a preface to Hill's <span class="italic">Christianity the True Religion: an Essay in Answer to the Blasphemy of a Deist</span> (1775) Hill is still described as a poor but worthy man. He died at Buckingham in July 1777 after a long illness.<br>
