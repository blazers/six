</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Behan,  (Francis) Brendan</span>  (1923&#150;1964), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 9 February 1923 at Holles Street Hospital, Dublin, the first of the four sons of Stephen Behan (<i>d</i>. 1968), house painter, and his wife, Kathleen, daughter of John Kearney, grocer. Stephen was doing time for IRA activities and Kathleen held the baby up high so that from a prison cell the father might see his first-born. He was Kathleen's second husband. From her first marriage she had brought two sons, Rory and Sean Furlong, one of them to become a socialist, both book lovers. Peadar Kearney, her brother, had written the &#145;Soldier's Song&#146; which became the Irish national anthem.<br>
<br>Brendan, a precocious child, could read before he went to school, which in his case was the William Street Convent, where the French Sisters of Mercy adored him. The Christian Brothers of St Canice's, Brunswick Street, to whom he was sent at eleven, were less keen on the tenement kid, themselves being of peasant stock.<br>
<br>Growing up in the classic Dublin of Sean O'Casey with the songs of Ireland and the stories of her martyrs, Behan lived for Ireland to be &#145;Free from the centre to the sea&#146;. He lived at 14 Russell Street, in a house owned by Granny English, his paternal grandmother, widow of Patrick English, her second husband. Granny English adored the boy, spoiled him, and gave him the taste for strong drink, while his maternal grandmother, Granny Furlong, would sound off about the splendid work the communists were doing upsetting the English. His family being so well read, Behan was soon familiar with Swift, Sheridan, Wilde, and Shaw as well as the English classics. P. J. Bourke, whose company played at the Queen's Theatre, was married to his aunt and as a boy Behan delighted in the shows there.<br>
<br>At fourteen when he left school Behan was apprenticed to his father's trade at the Bolton Street Technical School and became &#145;Peintre comme Picasso? Non! Peintre des b&acirc;timents&#146;. He read widely not only in the English language but also in Irish, carried a banner for the IRA, and thought up heroic speeches to be made from the dock in the style of Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet. A member of Fianna &Eacute;ireann, the junior branch of the IRA, Behan at an early age began contributing to the republican newspapers, anxiously waiting for the time when he could join the IRA. He had been rejected as too young also by the International Brigades. Some say that the IRA made use of the boy Behan in their bombing campaign in England, but others insist that he went to Liverpool on his own initiative, taking his home-made explosives, or &#145;conjuring tricks&#146; as he called them. In any event, he was followed and arrested. He made a patriotic speech at his trial in February 1940, got sentenced to three years in borstal (he served only two), and was, for a while, denied the solace of his religion.<br>
<br>The borstal he was detained in at Hollesley Bay, Suffolk, had an unexpected effect on Behan. Very quickly the writer in him had to recognize the wit of the English boys around him. Their accents and speech rhythms had to be learned. C. A. Joyce, the governor, was an enlightened man who favoured dialogue and a sense of fair play. He encouraged Behan in his reading and writing. The debating and swimming which Behan enjoyed were just part of the curriculum. He could go to mass but not holy communion. In this liberal atmosphere Behan flourished and his blind hatred of the English began to dissolve. However, he would not forswear his IRA activities. In April 1942, six months after his release, Behan was sentenced to fourteen years' penal servitude for the attempted murder of an Irish policeman. In prison he noted all the Dublin characters he had known, tried writing a play, read anything he could get his hands on, and improved his Irish, &#145;Largely so that the screws couldn't understand what we were saying&#146;. He found the IRA men in with him were an uninteresting lot and he looked for intellectual companionship. While he was in Mountjoy prison (his sentence was not served in just the one place) two prisoners were hanged. This had a profound effect on him, which found expression in <span class="italic">The Quare Fellow</span>, the name given in Irish prisons to the condemned man. Behan was released under general amnesty in 1946, having also served his time at Arbor Hill barracks and Curragh camp.<br>
<br>Dublin had changed. The young ones had created their own Bohemia. Tired of Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Russell (&AElig;), and George Moore, they met in pubs or the smoke-filled cellars of the club known as The Catacombs. Parties went on all night, Behan holding court with his stories and songs, being entertainer, clown, satirist. In ordinary conversation he stammered, but once in full flow he left his impediment behind. No one was safe from his wicked tongue. He would do Hugh MacDiarmid, the Scots nationalist poet, reciting endlessly in gibberish. MacDiarmid replied that you could hear Behan's language in any boozer.<br>
<br>Soon Behan took refuge among the Irish-speaking people of Kerry, where he found refreshment for his soul, thinking and writing in the language he loved as dearly as he loved English. When he saw Marlowe's <span class="italic">Edward II</span> at the Theatre Royal, Stratford-le-Bow, he said that he had thought so highly of Gaveston's first speech that he had translated it into Irish &#145;And claimed it as me own&#146;.<br>
<br>In March 1947 Behan was again in an English prison, for visiting England, which was forbidden to him, and spent four lonely months in Strangeways gaol. Back in Dublin, he served a month inside for starting a punch-up in a pub: he had been provoked by an antisemitic boozer.<br>
<br>Tired of it all, Behan made for Paris, where he lived on his wits, the occasional cheque, and the hospitality of anybody who cared to offer it. Desperately hungry, he tried his hand at pornography but even with the vision of half a pound of steak and a jug of wine floating before his eyes, he could not manage it until inspiration seized him. He made his chosen heroine an undercover agent for the IRA. Then it went swimmingly. Finally, he turned to house painting again, bars mainly. One found itself graced with &#145;This is the finest fucking bar in Paris&#146; beautifully painted on the white wall.<br>
<br>In 1950 Behan was in Dublin again and made a serious attack on <span class="italic">Borstal Boy</span>, the account of his experience at Hollesley Bay. It was a short spurt, but from it came the first chapter. Stories and articles were accepted and in 1952 he was still working on his autobiography. In 1953 the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> announced the first instalment of a serial about the Dublin underworld, <span class="italic">The Scarperer</span>, by Emmet Street. The story ran for thirty days but nothing further was heard from Mr Street. Behan published <span class="italic">The Confirmation Suit</span> under his own name. By now he was presenting a regular ballad programme, writing sketches for Radio &Eacute;ireann and three columns a week for the <span class="italic">Irish Press</span>. These columns were later published as a book, <span class="italic">Hold your Hour and have Another</span> (1963).<br>
<br>It was in this year, 1953, that diabetes attacked Behan, but it was not diagnosed until 1956. From then on drinking became much more dangerous while the effects of the disease could be mistaken for drunkenness. As a teenager Behan had been slim, fit, and good-looking with black hair, clear skin, and even teeth. A few short years of boozing and brawling had put an end to most of that. His face and body had run to fat. Only his tiny hands and feet gave a clue to the shape he should have been. In 1954 he sent his version of <span class="italic">The Quare Fellow</span>, which he had first called <span class="italic">Another Twist of the Rope</span>, to the Abbey Theatre. He had already sent a play, <span class="italic">The Landlady</span>, to them in 1946. Both were turned down. He also tried The Gate, run by Hilton Edwards and Miche&aacute;l MacLiamm&oacute;ir. They too turned it down but The Pike, a pocket theatre with fifty seats run by Alan Simpson and Carolyn Swift, were delighted with it and agreed to stage the play if Behan consented to work on it. In November 1954, on its first night, <span class="italic">The Quare Fellow</span> was acclaimed in Dublin. Brendan Behan made &pound;25 and found a lifelong love, Beatrice ffrench-Salkeld (1925&#150;1993), a botanist, the daughter of Cecil ffrench-Salkeld, a painter. They met at a performance and were married in February 1955. In January 1956 Behan sent his play to Theatre Workshop, where the style was exactly suited to his. It opened on 24 May and was a phenomenal hit, the first Irish play to succeed in London. Two months later it transferred to the Comedy Theatre in the West End.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Behan was selling extracts from <span class="italic">Borstal Boy</span> to the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> and <span class="italic">The People</span> without letting the one know about the other. With Beatrice watching over him, early rising, regular hours, and tea instead of booze, Behan managed to complete the book that was to be <span class="italic">Borstal Boy</span>.<br>
<br>When the first English hostage was taken in Cyprus, Theatre Workshop proposed a play on the subject. Behan offered to go away and write it if Theatre Workshop could pay him. They did, and bits of script began to arrive from Kerry, the hostage in Behan's work being Irish. In fact, as with the <span class="italic">Dispatch</span> and <span class="italic">The People</span>, he was selling the play twice over, first in Irish in Dublin as <span class="italic">An Giall</span> then in English, fragments only, to Theatre Workshop as <span class="italic">The Hostage</span>.<br>
<br>The subject was exciting and the company cared deeply for Behan but the play had to be finished from its memories of his stories. Luckily it had among it good memories. The drink was already taking hold of Behan. The writer was already submerged in the entertainer. He would join in <span class="italic">The Hostage</span> every night during the Stratford East production. Some nights he would be anti-British, other nights anti-Irish, and his participation then and later became a great draw. The show opened on 14 October 1958 and in 1959 was selected for the international festival of theatre at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris, where Behan joyously joined in. Later it was voted play of the year there. In Germany it was panned. Perhaps Behan did not realize that his plays would not take the conventional nineteenth-century style still affected by the commercial theatres.<br>
<br>Four days after the first night of <span class="italic">The Hostage</span>, <span class="italic">Borstal Boy</span> was published to universal acclaim. In autumn 1960 <span class="italic">The Hostage</span> was presented on Broadway at the Cort Theater. Behan went over for the first night. <span class="italic">Borstal Boy</span> had just been published in America, so New York was ready for him. In turn he was ready for it. Interviews and TV appearances, not to mention interruptions of his own play, ensured that he scored a great personal hit. The entertainer in Behan had triumphed. But he found it increasingly difficult to write, so his publishers encouraged him to record his stories and fragments of experience on tape. It was a way of appearing to be still at work but it was no substitute for writing and Behan knew it. He made an attempt at a new play, <span class="italic">Richard's Cork Leg</span>, but it was stillborn. Drink exacerbated by diabetes had damaged his health. Lack of discipline combined with the fatal ability to entertain by talking had weakened the writing muscle. Beatrice at his Dublin home, 5 Anglesea Road, had been ready to provide the right conditions for work but Behan's violent rages were now making her keep her distance. In any case, he was spending most of his time roaming from pub to pub, stopping out at night and talking, endlessly talking. In 1963 Beatrice gave birth to a daughter, Blanaid. Behan, although delighted, was unable to pull out of the nosedive. Three months into the following year he was taken to Meath Hospital, where he died, Beatrice by his side, on 20 March 1964. A glorious talent, a humane and gracious but very angry man died young. His coffin was draped in the tricolour and accompanied by an IRA guard of honour. A fourteen-year-old bugler from Fianna &Eacute;ireann sounded the &#145;Last Post&#146;. The funeral was said to have been the biggest since those of Michael Collins and C. S. Parnell as Brendan Behan was buried on 22 March 1964 at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>Various memoirs recalling Behan were published in the years following his death, including those by his wife and his brother. <span class="italic">Brendan Behan's New York</span> (1964), <span class="italic">Confessions of an Irish Rebel</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">The Scarperer</span> (1966), put together from his various tape recordings and sketches, were also published posthumously. Ulick O'Connor's <span class="italic">Brendan Behan</span> (1970) remains the standard biography. <span class="italic">Richard's Cork Leg</span> was staged in 1972 at the Peacock Theatre by Alan Simpson, who later assembled the <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> in 1978. The <span class="italic">Collected Letters</span> appeared in 1992.<br>
