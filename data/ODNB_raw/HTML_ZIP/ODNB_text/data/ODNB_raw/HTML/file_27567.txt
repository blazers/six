<span class="headword">Torrens,  (William) Torrens  McCullagh</span>  (1813&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, born at Delville House, near Dublin, on 13 October 1813, was the eldest son of James McCullagh of Delville, near Dublin, and Jane, daughter of Andrew Torrens of Dublin, the brother of Robert Torrens. Torrens McCullagh&#151;as he was known until 1863&#151;was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (BA, 1833; LLB, 1842). On 31 October 1832 he was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn; in 1836 he was called to the Irish bar at King's Inns, Dublin, and on 6 June 1855 was called to the English bar. He married in 1836 Margaret Henrietta, daughter of John Gray of Claremorris, co. Mayo, and sister of Sir John Gray MP.<br>
<br>Brought to the attention of Archbishop Whately for his support of Irish poor relief, in 1835 McCullagh was given the post of assistant commissioner to the special commission on relief of the Irish poor. He travelled extensively through Ireland, and presented thorough and valuable reports on the condition of the destitute poor, which contributed to the decision in 1838 to extend the workhouse system to Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1842 McCullagh assisted Sir Robert John Kane in founding the first Irish mechanics' institute, in Dublin; on its opening he delivered a course of lectures on the use and study of history, published in 1842. He joined the Anti-Corn Law League, and at the suggestion of Cobden published <span class="italic">The Industrial History of Free Nations</span> (1846), which attempted to prove that world progress had been achieved only by the industry of urban, non-feudal peoples and that the corn laws were restrictive of independence and self-culture.<br>
<br>From 1847 to 1852, when he and Sir Charles Napier failed to win Great Yarmouth, McCullagh was MP for the borough of Dundalk. In 1857 he was returned for Yarmouth, and in 1865 (having adopted his great-uncle's surname) for the old and undivided borough of Finsbury, where he retained the seat for twenty years. In parliament he was an independent Liberal, opposed to the introduction of a branch-based mass party, and his independence was to cause severe financial problems in later life. Though winning Finsbury on a platform of extension of the suffrage, the ballot, and the abolition of church rates, from 1865 he earned a reputation as a campaigner for metropolitan social reform. He supported Disraeli's proposal for household suffrage in 1867, and in committee on the bill moved and carried an amendment establishing the lodger franchise. In 1868 he introduced the landmark <span class="roman">Artisans' Dwellings Bill</span>, enabling local authorities to clear away overcrowded slums and erect decent dwellings for the working classes, which was passed despite a powerful opposition. In 1869 he obtained for London boards of guardians the power to board out pauper children. He was a defender of the right of political asylum; the <span class="roman">Extradition Act</span> of 1870, which prevented prisoners from being extradited on one plea and tried on another, was based on the report of a select committee appointed at his suggestion. During the discussions in committee of William Edward Forster's <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870, he proposed and carried an amendment establishing a school board for London, and he served on the Finsbury school board from 1870 to 1872. In 1885 he carried an act making the charge for water rates in the metropolis leviable only on the amount of the public assessment.<br>
<br>McCullagh Torrens was a tireless lobbyist and pamphleteer. He was a founder member of the Liberty and Property Defence League, established in 1882 to combat state socialism, the Clerkenwell Emigration Club, and the National Emigration League, set up in 1870. He also served on the Jamaica Committee and was vice-president of the Aborigines' Protection Society. He was a member of the executive of the Association for the Improvement of London Workhouse Infirmaries in 1866 and the executive of the Travelling Tax Abolition Committee from its inception in 1877. He was also a member of the Reform Club. His 1872 publication <span class="italic">Our Empire in Asia: how we Came by it</span> served as a critique of imperialism and a manifesto for self-rule.<br>
<br>McCullagh Torrens wrote several works of history and biography, including memoirs of R. Lalor Sheil (1855), Sir James Graham (1863), Viscount Melbourne (1878), and Lord Wellesley (1880), as well as the autobiographical <span class="italic">Twenty Years in Parliament</span> (1893) and the posthumous <span class="italic">History of Cabinets</span> (1894); the latter was based on twenty years' work, and to it he had devoted the last seven years of his life.<br>
<br>In 1878 McCullagh Torrens married his second wife, Emily, widow of Thomas Russell of Leamington Spa, and the third daughter of William Harrison of the same town. In 1885 he withdrew from parliament, the expense of which precipitated his bankruptcy, owing &pound;6630, in 1886. On 25 April 1894 he was knocked down by a hansom cab in London and severely injured. He died the following day at 23 Bryanston Square, the residence of his daughter.<br>
