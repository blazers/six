<span class="headword">Aston,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">composer and choirmaster</span>, is of obscure origins. He became one of the foremost church musicians of his generation, the peer of John Taverner, and yet biographers have sometimes confused him with namesakes. He is not Hugh Aston, canon of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, who died in 1522; nor is he Hugh Astyn of Balliol College, Oxford, who died in 1511; but two or three careers&#151;those of the composer, a local politician, and a recipient of monastic pensions, all active in and around Leicester towards the middle of the century&#151;have yet to be conclusively disentangled.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of the composer before 27 November 1510, when he supplicated successfully for the degree of BMus at the University of Oxford, submitting a mass and antiphon as his test pieces and stating that he had spent eight years in the study of music. The next known reference to him dates from 1520&#150;21, when the collegiate church of St Mary, Warwick, paid his return expenses from Coventry when he came to give advice about the organ; if he was then working in Coventry, it could have been with the cathedral's lady chapel choir or with one of the professional choirs maintained in their respective parish churches by the city guilds and fraternities.<br>
<br>By 1525 Aston was master of the choristers at the collegiate church of St Mary Newarke, Leicester, a wealthy foundation with a choir of some seventeen men and seven boys. He was well paid: his annual salary of &pound;10 matched that of the canons, and by 1540 it had risen to &pound;12; in addition, he paid no rent for his house in Hangman's Lane. His reputation can be judged by the fact that in 1526 he was first choice for the post of master of the choristers in Cardinal Wolsey's magnificent new foundation, Cardinal College, Oxford. Only after Aston had declined the position because of his prosperous circumstances at Leicester was it offered to John Taverner. Later references to the composer are scanty, but it seems that he remained at St Mary Newarke for the rest of his career. In September 1546 he travelled from Leicester to the important collegiate church of St Mary and All Saints at Fotheringhay, bringing music with him. When St Mary Newarke was dissolved in 1548 he received an annual pension of &pound;12, equivalent to his former salary.<br>
<br>From the early 1530s to the late 1550s a Hugh Aston was active in local politics in Leicester, becoming mayor in 1541 and representing the town in the 1555 parliament. Before the dissolutions several religious houses in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Warwickshire paid annuities to a Hugh Aston of Leicester (very possibly the same man), and at least one also paid a pension to a Katherine Aston, perhaps Hugh's wife. Such payments were usually made to local worthies for services received or anticipated. While it seems unlikely that a professional musician could have aspired to such status, the possibility of one or both of these men being the composer should perhaps be entertained until the social environment of early Tudor musicians is better understood.<br>
<br>Aston's surviving music, which includes two masses, five votive antiphons, a devotional song, a &#145;Maske&#146; for instrumental consort, and a keyboard &#145;Hornepype&#146;, is fluent, inventive, and vigorous, and innovative in imbuing the traditional florid style with a conspicuous sense of discipline. The musical connections between the mass <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> and the antiphon <span class="italic">Te Deum laudamus</span> suggest that these may be the works submitted for his BMus. Many of Aston's compositions show a striking fondness for ostinato writing, involving persistent reiteration and reworking of concise musical motifs; this is carried furthest in the &#145;Maske&#146;, which is constructed on an incessantly repeated ground bass (later used by William Byrd in a keyboard piece entitled &#145;Hugh Aston's Ground&#146;). An anonymous mass which has this ground as its <i>cantus firmus</i> may well also be by Aston.<br>
<br>The date of Aston's death is unknown, but he was buried at the parish church of St Margaret, Leicester, on 17 November 1558.<br>
