<span class="headword">Walden,  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1406), <span class="occ">administrator, archbishop of Canterbury, and bishop of London</span>, was from Walden (later Saffron Walden), Essex, and disdained by some contemporaries as of low birth, possibly the son of a butcher. While this may have been the family's trade, they could still have been, and do appear, quite prosperous and of standing.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlyadministrativecareer"></a>Family background and early administrative career</h2>The Waldens certainly had close associations with St Bartholomew's Priory, Smithfield, where two branches of the family actually had homes within the close and to which the bishop left the manors of Tottenham, Middlesex, and Dedham, Essex, if his brother had no male heirs. Indeed, this brother, John Walden esquire (<i>d</i>. 1417), married Idonea Lovetoft (<i>d</i>. 1425) and had just two daughters. He may have been only a half-brother to the bishop, for Isabelle Walden, who was living with John in 1400, was said to be only stepmother to the bishop. The surname was common around London and Essex: Sir Alexander Walden, for example, had a brother John in 1394&#150;5; it might well be possible to construct an extended pedigree from intensive research. There was a later suggestion that the bishop himself married in early life and even had a son, but there is no contemporary evidence for this, especially not in the bishop's will. Walden did not attend university, and, despite his evident administrative talent, critics such as Thomas Walsingham derided his lack of academic education.<br>
<br>Walden had entered royal service as a clerk before 6 September 1371, when he was presented to the rectory of St Helier, Jersey. He may, therefore, already have been serving in the Channel Islands, although in 1376 he was appointed as attorney in England for Robert Ferrour, who was going to Ireland. On 26 August 1378 he was appointed as attorney in the Channel Islands for various persons staying in England, while on 8 December 1379 he had a writ of protection as he set out for Jersey with Sir Hugh Calveley, warden of the islands. On 15 March 1382 he had custody of the estates of Sir Reginald Carteret on Jersey during the minority of the heir. About 1383&#150;4 he was formally entitled <i>locum tenens seu deputatus</i> (deputy warden) of the Channel Islands. On 24 June 1386 he was ordered to secure the king's share from five recently captured Castilian ships, and on 5 May 1387 he paid over &pound;100 for the <i>St John</i>, a similar capture.<h2>
<a name="Promotioningovernment"></a>Promotion in government</h2>Given Walden's special favour from Richard II later, caution must be applied to the reasons for his considerable career enhancement which began in 1387. Hitherto lightly endowed, he became archdeacon of Winchester by royal grant on 22 July 1387, and dean of St Martin's-le-Grand on 21 January 1390, enjoying the income without doing the work in both cases. There followed five rectories and six prebends, most held concurrently, in the next seven years. However, he was, as Adam Usk was to grumble later, &#145;better versed in military matters and the ways of the world than in church affairs or learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Adam of Usk</span>, 81&#150;3). From 20 March 1387 he was treasurer of Calais, presumably by appointment of the controversial commission appointed in 1386 to supervise the king's affairs; this position he still held on 21 October 1391, resigning before October 1393. He became, besides, captain of the march of Calais from 6 October 1387 to 10 October 1391. He had added the bailiwick of Gu&icirc;nes by 1 February 1390. All in all, he had become a powerful administrator in a key sphere at a very sensitive time, and gained the confidence of both the king and his critics. Being necessarily away from the centre so much probably helped him to avoid faction. He is to be found included in negotiations with France and Flanders throughout.<br>
<br>Walden acted as proctor for Bishop Thomas Brantingham of Exeter in parliament in January 1393, and for the chapter of Exeter in the concurrent convocation (so perhaps too in parliament). This shows he was in England at the time, and possibly even free of his various posts across the channel. He became king's secretary by 16 October 1393, but it has never been established that he held his Calais offices until that time or, indeed, when exactly he did join the king, who had not been allowed a secretary since 1387. Richard II's confidence in him cannot be doubted. Walden went with the king on his expedition to Ireland in 1394, returning with messages to the council in early January 1395. He was nominated by the king for the see of Exeter in that month, but this was in contradiction to a crown nomination already made of the keeper of the privy seal, Edmund Stafford, which the chapter and pope stood by. At least Walden secured Stafford's deanship of York in August (resigning his archdeaconry). The keeping of Portchester Castle, Hampshire, granted to him on 12 May 1395 and jointly with his brother John on 1 February 1397, was profitable as well as responsible work; it was forfeited in September 1399.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1395 Walden became treasurer of the realm, retaining the position until 22 January 1398. In a mild flirtation with ecclesiastical matters, he had joint custody of Beaulieu Abbey from 16 March 1397 to settle disputes in the house, and on 12 April 1397 he, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, and bishops Stafford and Richard Medford (Salisbury) were appointed to hear a dispute between the bishop and cathedral of Norwich, a predictably tortuous business, given the personalities involved, which still engaged him on 1 March 1399. This business was the only sign that he was seen as appropriate to the weightiest matters of the church.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>On 25 September 1397 Richard II banished Archbishop Arundel from the realm as party to the supposed treason of his brother, the earl of Arundel, and others, both in 1386&#150;8 and recently. By 8 November Boniface IX had agreed to translate Arundel to the schismatic see of St Andrews and provide Walden to Canterbury. On 21 January 1398 Walden received the temporalities, with effect from 25 September previous. He was consecrated on 3 February and enthroned on 24 March. There had been no immediate promotion to Canterbury since 1349. &#145;Modest, pious and courteous&#146; though he was, &#145;practical and sensible in his conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Adam of Usk</span>, 81), Walden's career had been extremely secular, with almost literally no experience of church matters, and not even a formal academic qualification amid an episcopal bench bristling with doctorates. &#145;He rose by leaps and bounds, far too hastily in fact&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Adam of Usk</span>, 83). It is very hard to see his appointment as a wise one by the king, especially in such controversial circumstances. There is no sign that Richard had tried but failed to entice any more senior figure to fill the office (but nor is there evidence, it should be said, that the pope had any qualms); presumably Richard was determined to stifle any objections from the English church to his treatment of Arundel or other actions in its direction, but he was being supremely optimistic if he thought Walden could enjoy credibility. The new archbishop was present at Coventry in September 1398, to witness the king's halting of the Mowbray&#150;Bolingbroke duel, and was named as a supervisor of the wills of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (3 February 1399), and of the king himself (16 April).<br>
<br>There was no time to discover how Walden intended to approach his unexpected primacy, although despite the absence of a register it can be discovered from various sources that he spent all the time he could in his diocese. He was arrested in Westminster by the London authorities in August 1399, once they heard of Richard II's capture by Henry Bolingbroke. Arundel, who was with Bolingbroke, had resumed as archbishop <i>de facto</i> as soon as they invaded England, and formally from 1 October. Walden's possessions were distrained in Arundel's favour forthwith, the return of stolen goods as it were. Walden himself was placed rather surprisingly in the friendly custody of William Colchester, abbot of Westminster, through whom he apparently became associated with the conspiracy leading to the &#145;Epiphany plot&#146; in 1400. He was committed to the Tower of London on 10 January and put on trial shortly after the 28th; he pleaded privilege as a consecrated bishop, but this was denied and apparently he was found guilty on 4 February. However, he was then freed immediately and even acquitted by the crown, being granted full restitution of his property as early as 23 February. On 12 July 1400 the king even granted him two tuns of Gascony wine a year. He probably took up residence in London.<br>
<br>It can only be supposed that, although he had made an improbable archbishop, Walden's previous administrative career had been an honest and respected one, that his elevation to Canterbury was seen as an involuntary submission to Richard's determined mood in 1397, that he personally had not been an intimate or political crony of the disgraced king, and that it was his misfortune, not fault, if even his gaoler fell under suspicion of treason. Certainly, Archbishop Arundel bore him no ill will, as indeed he may generally have been instrumental in the forgiving attitude of the dynasty to those several bishops embarrassingly close to the late king who would by recent practice have suffered seriously for it.<h2>
<a name="BishopofLondon"></a>Bishop of London</h2>Walden's last episode, however, is the most curious. He was apparently the king's choice for the see of Rochester in 1404, as too of Arundel once the archbishop's first-choice candidate had declined his election. However, Boniface IX translated Richard Young, replacing him at Bangor with an adherent of Owain Glyn D&#373;r. Unsurprisingly, the king blocked this. Then Bishop Robert Braybrooke of London died on 28 August 1404. Arundel certainly urged the king to promote Robert Hallum, his own principal officer, claiming later (not very convincingly) that he was unaware that Henry IV wanted to make a nomination. Of course he did, and Thomas Langley, his keeper of the privy seal, soon to become chancellor, was elected on 10 October 1404. Yet on 10 December Walden was provided by the new pope, Innocent VII. This infuriated the king, who came to listen to stories that Arundel and Hallum had swung behind Walden in curial machinations to frustrate Langley. Hallum himself had to go to Rome to have the pope declare their innocence. Things hung fire for six months. Then everything changed on 8 June 1405. The king executed Archbishop Richard Scrope of York as a traitor in arms. Arundel was appalled by the canonical consequences of the king's deed, which had been perpetrated in open contradiction of his own urgent advice. Henry was defiant, not only defending himself but wanting Langley to have York. However, he realized that all possible had to be done to minimize the pope's reaction to the execution. On 24 June Walden was allowed to have London. He made his profession to the archbishop five days later, and was enthroned the next day.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Walden took with interest to this, his native diocese. Indeed, he even had the energy to be at Worcester with the king in October, probably helping to receive (or perhaps deliver) clerical and lay subsidies. It was sudden sickness, not old age, that obliged him to make his will at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, on 31 December. He died on either 9 or, more probably, 11 January 1406. John Prophete described in a private letter his lying-out in St Bartholomew's and the procession to All Saints' Chapel in St Paul's Cathedral for the interment on 14 January and, having himself uncovered the bishop's face, how much better he looked than in life. He added that Walden, whom he had known well for over twenty years, had never bemoaned his bad times or gorged in his good ones. Arundel added his own tribute to Walden's honesty of life and his thought for his priestly duties. Even Usk was to agree that he had been a pleasant and popular participant in public life. This perhaps is the key to what might otherwise, from just official records, seem a characterless and partisan career.<br>
