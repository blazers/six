<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Narayan,  Rahasya Rudra <span class="st"> [Rudy]</span></span>  (1938&#150;1998), <span class="occ">barrister and civil rights activist</span>, was born on 11 May 1938 in British Guiana, the ninth of ten children of Sase Narayan, landowner, and his wife, Taijbertie. He came from a politically active Indo-Guyanese family, engaged mainly in trading. He arrived in Britain in 1953 and after a series of menial jobs (including washing dishes at a Lyons' Corner House and working night shifts at a soap factory) joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. He left the army in 1965, after seven years' service, with the rank of sergeant. He then read for the bar, at Lincoln's Inn. There he helped to found the bar students' union; he became its first president and also captained the inns of court cricket club&#151;a passion which never left him. He was called to the bar in 1968. On 5 September 1969 he married Dr Naseem Akbar (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), medical practitioner, and daughter of Mohamed Akbar, diplomat. They had two daughters, Sharmeen and Yasmeen.<br>
<br>In advocacy Narayan found his m&eacute;tier. He was a fluent, powerful, and persuasive speaker and, when he needed to be, a sound lawyer. He defended with remarkable success in a series of high-profile trials arising out of confrontations between black people and the police. But he encountered, like other black and ethnic minority barristers, the glass panel beyond which lay the steadier work and heavier briefs which were his due. After learning finally that clients who asked solicitors to brief him were being told he was not available, and angered at the apparent over-sentencing of black defendants, Narayan went public. It is improbable that a more temperate assault on the legal establishment would even have been noticed; but Narayan's protest, loud and uncompromising, was not only noticed&#151;it resulted in the first of the three disciplinary adjudications which finally drove him from the bar. This one, in 1974, for bringing the administration of justice into disrepute (by alleging that Birmingham solicitors, counsel, and judges were racist), was followed in 1980 by a reprimand for discourtesy to a judge. In 1982 he was acquitted by the bar council of professional misconduct in issuing an extravagant press statement about the attorney-general and the director of public prosecutions (accusing them of &#145;collusion with the National Front and fanning the flames of racial hatred&#146;), though his accusations were found &#145;scandalous and contemptuous&#146; and he was suspended for six weeks after being found guilty of four other, unrelated charges  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 June 1998). By then he had become an over-heavy drinker and was lashing out at the nearest target.<br>
<br>Narayan achieved high-profile successes in the trials arising out of the Bristol riots of 1980 and the Bradford petrol bomb case of 1982. Nevertheless in 1984 he was expelled from his chambers in the Inner Temple after assaulting the chambers' head, Sibghat Kadri, at a conference. He announced his intention of qualifying as a solicitor, but failed the Law Society examinations. Then, back at the bar, in 1988 he put himself in the wrong by accepting briefs in two contemporaneous trials. Although he attacked the all-white disciplinary tribunal which heard his case, he was suspended for two years (a fate, he asserted, which did not invariably await counsel who got themselves overbooked). In the following year he polled 177 votes standing as an independent in the Vauxhall by-election, in protest at the Labour Party's &#145;outrageous and blatant exclusion of black candidates for a constituency made safe for Labour by black votes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 June 1998).<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 26 March 1988 Narayan married Saeeda Begum Shah (<i>b</i>. 1948/9), property dealer, and daughter of Fazal Karim Asif, advocate. This marriage, too, ended in divorce. In 1991 Narayan returned to Guyana, where little went his way. He returned to Britain three years later, an activist now without roots, an advocate turned demagogue, an anti-racialist stained with antisemitism, and now a terminal drinker. The series of disciplinary adjudications culminated in 1994 in his disbarment, for professional misconduct. In 1995 a minor riot followed his speech outside Brixton police station, following the death of a black man in custody. Narayan himself died at King's College Hospital, Lambeth, London, on 28 June 1998, of cirrhosis of the liver. He was survived by the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Narayan left behind him far more than a trail of failures. The Society of Black Lawyers, which he played a leading part in founding in 1973, remained as a necessary voice for an important professional minority. His books <span class="italic">Black Community on Trial</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Black England</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Barrister for the Defence</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">When Judges Conspire</span> (1989) may one day be revisited as more than memorials to his self-regard, though they are certainly that. The Lambeth Law Centre, of which he was the first chairman and where he held regular surgeries, survived him in a pivotal role in the south London community.<br>
<br>Above all, it was the waves made by a man who was too volatile and too intransigent ever to coast to success on them himself which in Narayan's lifetime began to erode the bar's and the legal system's self-assurance about racial discrimination. The setting up of the bar council's race relations committee in 1984, and the continued concern which produced an amendment of the <span class="roman">Race Relations Act</span> to outlaw race discrimination in the legal profession, and then, in 1995, the bar's own equality code, all owed something&#151;possibly a good deal&#151;to the attention which Narayan had drawn to a legal profession which had much to be embarrassed about. That he had done so extravagantly and intemperately, alienating many other ethnic minority lawyers on the way, may be less a criticism of him than an illustration of the fact that it tends to be only when an angry member of a disadvantaged group exposes him- or herself to fire that things begin to change. In his assault on the English legal system Narayan sacrificed his reputation, his practice, his bearings, and his health; but through the breach he made, younger black advocates have since passed.<br>
