<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  Griffith</span>  (1587/8&#150;1672), <span class="occ">bishop of Ossory and controversialist</span>, was born in the township of Treflan near Caernarfon into a well-established family of freeholders; according to Sir John Wynn, his mother's ancestors were from Penmynydd, Anglesey. After private education at Caernarfon, on 15 June 1604, aged sixteen, he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford. Unhappy there, as he later recounted, he attempted to leave for France. However, with the assistance of John Williams (1582&#150;1650), then fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, Griffith transferred to Cambridge, where early in 1606 he graduated BA from Jesus College. He was ordained deacon at Rochester early in 1607 and priest at Ely on 30 May, and the following year was presented by Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton, to the rectory of Foxcott, Buckinghamshire. He proceeded MA from Cambridge in 1609.<br>
<br>In 1612 Williams resigned Foxcott when his career took a significant step forward. On the presentation of the crown he was instituted on 11 January that year to the rectory of St Benet Sherehog, London. He also became a Sunday preacher at St Peter Eastcheap and St Paul's Cathedral. At this point he would have been well placed to marry, and in view of later references to his wife, Anne, it seems likely that they were the Gryffyn Wyllyames and Ann Cheany married on 5 September 1614 at St Olave Jewry, London. On 13 June that year he preached at Paul's Cross; although <span class="italic">The Resolution of Pilate</span> was entered in the Stationers' register on 22 July, the contemporary printed version appears not to have survived, and it is difficult to tell from the amplified version in Williams's <span class="italic">The Best Religion</span> (1636) exactly which elements of its anti-puritanism were aired in 1614. However, the opinions in <span class="italic">The Resolution</span> and more general dissatisfaction expressed by some of his leading parishioners led in 1616 to his suspension from preaching by John King, bishop of London; by 20 December, when his successor was instituted, he had resigned his living. In the meantime some parishioners charged that he had attempted to obtain the benefice by causing the death of the previous incumbent, but this accusation was firmly dismissed by the recorder of London, Thomas Coventry.<br>
<br>Released from an uncomfortable time in Newgate, Williams retreated to Cambridge, where in the course of 1616 he proceeded BD and successfully appealed against his suspension to the prerogative court. His controversial opinions were evidently far outweighed by his connection to John Williams, now chaplain to the lord chancellor, Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere. Still in 1616, Griffith was presented by Ellesmere and the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, to the rectory of Llanllechid in his native county. Here he soon clashed with his bishop, Lewis Bayly (who was already at odds with Abbot) over the non-payment of a double benevolence, and was allegedly prohibited for a long time from holding services. On appeal to the court of arches, Williams's licence to preach was again restored; Bayly was reprimanded.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Williams apparently spent periods both in England and in Wales. In 1621 he proceeded DD at Cambridge. He retained a pronounced sense of grievance at what he perceived as persecution, and a deep gratitude to his patrons. His <span class="italic">The Delights of the Saints</span> (1622), based on a sermon at Paul's Cross on 2 December 1621 and others at St Paul's Cathedral, centred on the doctrine of free and universal grace. Dedicated to John Williams, now bishop of Lincoln, the work acknowledged him as the author's &#145;chiefest comfort&#146; throughout his career, when he had &#145;got nothing but afflictions and puritanicall hatred in every place&#146;  (sig. A3). It also recognized encouragement given by Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, and his countess, to whom he already seems to have been chaplain, and with whom, as he explained elsewhere, he spent a significant portion of eighteen years living &#145;in His Majesty's house at the Cock Pit&#146;, Westminster  (Bolton, 325). A further &#145;epistle gratulatorie&#146;, addressed to his kinsman Sir John Wynn of Gwydir and his son Sir Richard, gentleman of the privy chamber to the prince of Wales, praised the former as an enlightened and godly layman who defended the religious order and promoted preaching. In 1625 Williams asked Wynn, also an ally of Bishop Williams, to obtain for him the living of Llanaber, Merioneth, because he desired &#145;to return to Wales and do his best for his country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Wynn of Gwydir Papers, 1515&#150;1690</span>, 1926, nos. 1338, 1378). He was appointed preacher at Llanrwst and in 1626 rector of Trefdraeth in Anglesey.<br>
<br>By about this time Williams had preached before the king at Greenwich and at Theobalds. These sermons were included in his <span class="italic">Seven Golden Candlesticks, Holding the Seaven Greatest Lights of the Christian Religion</span> (1627), dedicated to the earl and countess of Montgomery and their children, to whom he acted as tutor. An additional epistle to Bishop Williams and Wynn, which perhaps glanced at their common foe Bishop Bayly, castigated the &#145;practise of many&#146; in the Church of England &#145;either basely to sell their spirituall promotions, or sinisterly to bestow them on their friends, their kinsmen and alliances&#146;  (sig. A5<i>v</i>), while &#145;To the Christian Reader&#146; thanked God for the author's deliverance from &#145;wicked men&#146;, who &#145;did combine with a craftier cruelty, then ever &hellip; the Arrian Bishops did against that innocent constant Athanasius, to take away my feeble life&#146;  (sig. A7). On 17 July 1628 Williams was appointed to the prebend at Westminster vacated by William Laud on his translation to the bishopric of London, but the following year Laud allegedly hindered Williams's proposed promotion to the bishopric of St Asaph. The content of his <span class="italic">The True Church Shewed to All Men</span> (1629), dedicated to Montgomery and his brother William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, suggests that any antagonism was not doctrinally based. While the work stressed the importance of sabbath observance, it argued that scruple over ceremonies was no excuse for separation from the church and deplored the tendency of Christians to adopt labels such as Calvinist or Zwinglian.<br>
<br>In 1634 Williams finally received promotion in Wales when he was made dean of Bangor, where he was installed by proxy on 28 March, and archdeacon of Anglesey. The following year, however, he was summoned before the court of high commission for neglecting his wife, Anne, and entered a bond of &pound;500 to improve his behaviour towards her. She brought a suit for alimony against him in the court, but the case ended in a reconciliation. In 1636 Williams gathered twenty-four of his sermons given at court and elsewhere and published them as <span class="italic">The Best Religion</span>, with a dedication to the king. None the less, about 1638 Laud, then archbishop, apparently prevented his becoming tutor to the prince of Wales and the duke of York.<br>
<br>In 1641 Williams gained his bishopric, but had little chance to enjoy his success. Preferred by the king to a candidate advanced by the Irish bishops, he was nominated on 19 July as bishop of Ossory. Consecrated in Dublin on 20 September, he was permitted to hold the deanery of Bangor <i>in commendam</i> because of the see's poverty. But, according to his own account, he had preached only once in the cathedral when rebellion broke out in Ulster in late October, and following its subsequent spread southwards, he returned to England and joined his family at Apthorpe, near Towcester, Northamptonshire. Early in 1642 he was back in Dublin, but rebels had control of towns in his diocese and the Catholic bishop, David Rothe, had assumed the see. After attending the Irish parliament in early August, on 16 August he received a licence to return to England on his own affairs. Once at Apthorpe he was immediately arrested by parliamentary forces, but, defending himself as a victim of the Irish rebels, he obtained a safe conduct, joined the king's army, and served as a chaplain at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October.<br>
<br>The following winter Williams stayed in the royalist headquarters at Oxford, where he published <span class="italic">Vindiciae regum</span> (1643). According to the dedicatory epistle to Charles I, he had completed the manuscript in Dublin before his flight and concealed it during his brush with the parliamentarians. Addressing both English and Irish issues, the work defended the king and his bishops from a dual onslaught of Catholics and puritans: they were &#145;pressed, opposed and abused betwixt two rebellious factions &hellip; persecuted and crucified betwixt two hereticall and tyranicall parties&#146;  (p. 97). This drew from John Goodwin, London minister and leading apologist for war against the king, <span class="italic">Os Ossoriarum, or, A Bone for a Bishop to Pick</span> (1643), an attack on monarchical divine right. Williams's next work, <span class="italic">The Discovery of Mysteries</span>, also published in Oxford and dedicated to Charles, was written from Plas Hwfa, Llanllechid. Subtitled as an exposure of &#145;plots in &hellip; this present Parliament to overthrow the established Religion&#146; it revealed that the author had come to consider puritans an even greater threat than Catholics: &#145;this Faction hath justified all the Romanists, and shewed themselves worse Christians, lesse Subjects and viler Traitors than all the Papists are&#146;  (p. 102). As if to confirm this judgement, on 8 March 1644, while Williams was away preaching to the royalist parliament at Oxford, his house at Apthorpe was plundered, his family was driven out, and his possessions were sequestered. He responded with <span class="italic">Jura maiestatis: the Rights of Kings both in Church and State</span> (1644) and <span class="italic">An Examination of such Particulars in the Solemn League and Covenant as Concern the Law</span> (1644).<br>
<br>In the next fifteen years Williams moved regularly between England, Wales, and Ireland, sometimes in the later 1640s carrying letters between the king and the marquess of Ormond. He attended the Irish House of Lords eight times between 3 February 1645 and 24 February 1656, and in the summer of 1645 was one of the protestant bishops who signed a paper proposing increased jurisdictional powers for the ecclesiastical courts of the established church. Caught up in the abortive royalist resistance in north Wales in 1646, he several times narrowly avoided capture by parliamentary forces, and reached Dublin, by his own account, after some subterfuge. There he preached regularly and took prayer book services. On 1 April 1647 he was presented to the rectory of Rathfarnham near Dublin, but following the city's capitulation later that year he was briefly taken prisoner. With assistance from Ormond and from Dudley Loftus of Rathfarnham, the politician and orientalist, he then went to London seeking to take advantage of the Dublin articles of surrender to regain his living in Anglesey and his sequestered Northamptonshire estate. His request was denied by the committee for sequestrations, and although back in Dublin he enlisted the support of Henry Jones, bishop of Clogher, his brother Colonel Michael Jones, parliamentarian governor of Dublin, and through them General Sir Thomas Fairfax, he failed to get the decision overturned. In London again with Ormond, he saw the king at Hampton Court prior to the latter's escape to the Isle of Wight in November.<br>
<br>Returning briefly to Wales, Williams rejected an offer from the earl of Pembroke of a substantial Lancashire living since it was conditional on submission to parliament. In March 1648 he preached three times in Dublin, where he courted controversy then and later by praying for Fairfax as an instrument of peace. Back in Llanllechid he began to write &#145;The Great Antichrist Revealed&#146; in which he &#145;applied all the apocalyptic passages to puritanism which had previously been used against the established church&#146;  (Milton, 119n). Following his refusal in 1650 to take the Welsh form of the engagement, he was sequestered from his parish of Trefdraeth in Anglesey and forbidden to preach in the principality, but the next year, during Charles II's campaign before the battle of Worcester, he emerged to deliver a staunchly royalist sermon before the judges at Conwy; uproar ensued. Thereafter Williams was often in Ireland, regularly preaching in Dublin. Some time after Henry Cromwell became lord deputy in November 1657 Williams delivered in his presence a sermon upholding the episcopal order and the prayer book liturgy and calendar; Cromwell's response was reportedly quite amicable. Unsuccessful in 1659 in finding a London publisher willing to take his &#145;The Great Antichrist&#146;, despite a personal visit, Williams once more made his way back to Ireland.<br>
<br>In the early summer of 1660 Williams was at Holyhead when he heard of the king's restoration. Having landed at Dublin he preached at St Bride's Church, claiming later that he had been the first man in Ireland to pray publicly for Charles II. After fleeting visits to Kilkenny and to Lady Ormond at Donmore, he hurried to London, where <span class="italic">The Great Antichrist</span> was finally published and presented to the king. At this more opportune moment its subtitle denounced the Westminster assembly as &#145;a collected pack or multitude of hypocritical, heretical, blasphemous, and most scandalous wicked men, that have fulfilled all the prophesies &hellip; of the coming of the great Antichrist&#146; but probably struck more than a few of its readers as &#145;a piece of Restoration triumphalism&#146;  (Bolton, 334).<br>
<br>Restored to both his Irish bishopric and his Welsh deanery, Williams participated on 27 January 1661 in the consecration of twelve brother bishops and then turned his attention to the reconstruction of his own diocese, whose parlous state he first described in <span class="italic">Seven Treatises</span> (1661). His primary visitation found devastation in his cathedral, widespread intrusion of non-episcopally ordained clergy into livings, and alienation of revenues. Although the bishop spent his own money on extensive refurbishment, his combative spirit led him also into expensive lawsuits and self-justificatory tracts. <span class="italic">The True Relation of a Law Proceeding between the Bishop of Ossery and Sir George Askue</span> (1663) described his ultimately futile attempts to regain permanent possession of the chief episcopal residence, Bishopscourt, and the &pound;400 of annual rent which he calculated went with it. <span class="italic">The Persecution and Oppression of John Bale, Bishop of Ossory, and of Griffith Williams</span> (1664) recounted personal tribulations going back over several decades with the touch of paranoia apparent in much of his writing. When in <span class="italic">The Sad Condition of the Church and Clergy of the Diocese of Ossory</span> (1664) Williams not only exposed the scandalous under-endowment of competent parish clergy throughout Ireland but also criticized the frequent, and as he saw it burdensome, archiepiscopal visitations, he provoked considerable protest. His request to the archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert Sheldon, in dedicating to him <span class="italic">Several Sermons</span> (1665), that visitations in the Church of Ireland might be reduced to the form and frequency practised in England effectively challenged earlier affirmations of the former's independence. On 2 December 1665 convocation censured the tract for &#145;bringing scandal on &#147;the national Church of Ireland&#148;&#146;  (Bolton, 333) and both Williams and his archdeacon, Joseph Teate, who had also made indiscreet remarks about visitations, apologized.<br>
<br>While further investigations conducted under the eye of the archbishop of Armagh, James Margetson, apparently ended in reconciliation, with a breach between Williams and the dean of Ossory, Thomas Ledsham, publicly healed, the bishop had not lost his sense of ill-usage. <span class="italic">Four treatises &hellip; whereunto is added a small part of the great wickedness, and sacrilegious dealings of the great Antichrist in the diocese of Ossory</span> (1667) not only revisited his unsuccessful lawsuits to recover alienated church lands but also reproduced a letter from the bishop of Bangor threatening Williams with sequestration if he did not repair his deanery. Choosing to disbelieve that the Welsh bishop was acting under pressure from Canterbury, Williams noted that this was a blow worse than any he had received from &#145;King, bishop of London or any other assistant of antichrist&#146;  (Bolton, 333). In 1668 his high-handed treatment of his cathedral and other clergy led to a rift with Dean Teate, whose complaint to the king was taken seriously. By this time hopeful rumours were circulating of the elderly bishop's death, but when Ormond anticipated it by recommending Teate to succeed him in the see, Archbishop Sheldon had to reply that Williams was alive and well in London. Well aware of Williams's anger over the Bangor deanery, Sheldon predicted that he would be attacked in the bishop's next publication.<br>
<br>None appeared, but Williams outlived Teate, who was drowned in December 1670. The bishop died at Kilkenny on 29 March 1672. He was buried on the south side of his cathedral, where he had repaired the choir and spent a further &pound;1400. The almshouses he had had built nearby for poor women lasted into the nineteenth century.<br>
