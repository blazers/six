<span class="headword">Butler,  Edward Dundas</span>  (1842&#150;1919), <span class="occ">linguist and librarian</span>, was born on 15 October 1842 at 6 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, the son of Thomas Butler and his wife, Jane Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> North. Having been educated at Blue Coat School, London, he joined the department of printed books of the British Museum as a transcriber on 31 December 1859 at the age of seventeen. When a separate department of maps was set up in 1867 he was transferred to it, and promoted in 1869, becoming second in command to the keeper. In 1880 he was promoted assistant, first class, and transferred with the map collection back to the main library. His duties included examining and arranging accessions to the collection of maps, preparing the map catalogue for printing, and cataloguing general works in the so-called &#145;difficult languages&#146;, which, in his case, included Hungarian, Finnish, and Romanian. He retired probably on his sixtieth birthday in 1902.<br>
<br>It may be assumed that Butler's interest in the lesser literatures of eastern Europe originated in his training in the British Museum, where Thomas Watts laid special emphasis on acquiring material in neglected languages. Butler proved himself an able translator from Hungarian and Finnish in particular. His translations included a collection of poems and fables from the Hungarian (1877), which <span class="italic">The Academy</span> (23 June 1877) found &#145;as suggesting a hope that the Museum still continues to Hungarian literature the enlightened patronage which distinguished it in the time of the late Mr Thomas Watts&#146;, as well as a longer piece by J&aacute;nos Arany (1881). Butler was also responsible for the first history of Finnish literature in English, translated from the Finnish original of B. F. Godenhjelm (1896). His contributions to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn, 1875&#150;89) and miscellaneous pieces in periodicals revealed the range of his interest.<br>
<br>It is not known whether Butler ever visited the countries whose literature he studied; he certainly established good connections with Hungary, where his activity was followed with interest. As a result of his literary activity he was elected corresponding member of the Kisfaludy T&aacute;rsas&aacute;g (2 February 1879) and external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (19 May 1881). Contemporary British opinion praised the &#145;conscientious and faithful rendering of both spirit and form of the original&#146; in his translations  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 3 Nov 1877).<br>
<br>Butler died of heart failure on 11 February 1919 at his home, 66 Whitehall Park, Islington, London, leaving at least one son, Frank.<br>
