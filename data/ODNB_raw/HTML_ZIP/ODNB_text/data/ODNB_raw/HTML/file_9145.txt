<span class="headword">Fanning,  Edmund</span>  (1737&#150;1818), <span class="occ">colonial official and army officer</span>, was born on 24 April 1737, in Southold township (now Riverhead) on Long Island, New York, North America, the fifth son of Captain James Fanning, army officer, of Riverhead, Long Island, and Hannah Smith of Smithtown. He graduated from Yale College with a BA and a Berkeley scholarship in 1757, studied briefly at Harvard College, and then moved to Hillsborough, in Orange county, North Carolina. There he was elected a trustee and commissioner of the town (1760), and was admitted to the bar (1762). He became successively an assemblyman for Orange county (1762, 1766&#150;8), a public register (1763) and militia officer (1763; from 1767, colonel), judge of the superior court (1765), and borough representative for Hillsborough (1771).<br>
<br>The patronage of Governor William Tryon accelerated Fanning's professional rise and increased his unpopularity. Fanning became the scapegoat of the backcountry regulator movement which protested against high fees and excessive taxes settled upon the western counties by the colonial government of the eastern seaboard. Regulators fired on his house in April 1768, and later razed it in September 1770, before dragging him through the streets of Hillsborough. At the regulators' insistence, he was tried for extortion, and convicted but not punished; he thereupon resigned from the office of register. Inflamed by this humiliation, he subsequently commanded a corps of militia at the battle of Great Alamance Creek (16 May 1771) and helped Governor Tryon decisively to suppress the insurgent regulators. When Tryon moved to become governor of New York in 1771, Fanning followed him as his private secretary and was immediately appointed surrogate of the province; three years later, in 1774, he became surveyor-general of New York. In 1776 he raised and commanded a loyalist corps known as the associated refugees or the King's American regiment of foot which gained a reputation for cruelty during the American War of Independence. In 1779 his remaining property in North Carolina was pronounced confiscate, though it was not sold until 1786; he later received &pound;4447 from the loyalist claims commission.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Fanning became a colonel in the British army, and was subsequently promoted to major-general (12 October 1793), lieutenant-general (26 June 1799), and general (25 April 1808). On 23 September 1783 he was appointed councillor and lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia; he held these offices until he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island on 26 July 1786. He married Phoebe Maria Burns at Point Pleasant, Nova Scotia, on 30 November 1785; together they had three daughters, Louisa Augusta (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1787), Maria S. Matilda (<i>b</i>. 1791), and Margaret William Tryon (<i>b</i>. 1801), and a son, Frederick Augustus (1789&#150;1812). In 1790, when war with Spain seemed possible, he offered to lead a British-American campaign force in the Floridas. In 1792 the privy council dismissed charges of tyranny that had been preferred against him. During his colonial career, various British and American colleges garlanded him with degrees. He received honorary MAs from Harvard College in 1764 and from King's College, New York (later Columbia University), in 1772, and a DCL from Oxford University on 6 July 1774; both Yale and Dartmouth later presented him with honorary LLDs in 1803.<br>
<br>Fanning resigned the lieutenant-governorship of Prince Edward Island in 1805, and went for a few months to London; he moved there permanently in 1813 and died at Upper Seymour Street on 28 February 1818. He was survived by his wife and their three daughters. Lord Selkirk's judgement that he was &#145;no superabundant head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Selkirk's Diary</span>, 6) was partial rather than conclusive; he has more recently been judged &#145;the most successful of the breed&#146; of loyalist governors of British North America  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>, 5.312). Likewise, his reputation as a tyrannical instrument of British colonial policy is largely undeserved; it is more significant as an index of the intra-colonial tensions that fed into the American War of Independence and, later, of the paternalism of British imperial government in the counter-revolutionary decades following the British defeat.<br>
