<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shipley,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1715, <em>d.</em> 1803), <span class="occ">founder of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce</span>, was baptized on 2 June 1715 at St Stephen Walbrook, London. He was the third son of Jonathan Shipley (1676&#150;1719), a native of Leeds and a citizen and stationer of London, and Martha Shipley (<i>d</i>. 1757), daughter of William Davies (1658&#150;1727) of Twyford in Hampshire. His oldest surviving brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25411/', "Bishop Jonathan Shipley")</script>. Brought up by his mother and grandfather at Twyford he received nine years of grammatical schooling from about 1725 to about 1734 and was then apprenticed for seven years to the painter Charles Phillips, who lived and worked in Great Queen Street, London. Shipley frequented Old Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane, which was a favourite resort of the leading artists of the time. In 1741 he obtained a place as a gentleman pensioner at arms but resigned from it after four years because its rules forbade him to practise as a professional artist. He then travelled the country drawing perspective views of noblemen's and gentlemen's estates before settling as a teacher of drawing and painting in Northampton in 1747.<br>
<br>Shipley was warmly welcomed into the Northampton Philosophical Society, &#145;the Royal Society in miniature&#146;, as he called it  (W. Shipley to H. Baker, 18 Oct 1747, English MSS 19, 3, 154), on account of his friendship with Henry Baker FRS FSA, to whom he communicated matters of interest to the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. He also gained support for a philanthropic scheme to buy winter fuel for the poor of Northampton in 1751 and for his <span class="italic">Proposals for raising by subscription a fund to be distributed in premiums for the promoting of improvements in liberal arts and sciences, manufactures, etc</span>, a broadsheet pamphlet which he eventually published in June 1753. Soon afterwards, on Baker's advice he went to London and published his <span class="italic">Scheme for putting the proposals in execution modelled partly from the plan used by the Dublin Society</span> (7 December 1753). Two original features of his <span class="italic">Scheme</span> were that women as well as men could become members of the proposed society, and that medals could be given for especially valuable inventions and improvements, or as honorary awards. Through the clergyman-scientist Stephen Hales DD FRS Shipley met lords Folkestone and Romney, two influential peers who were already considering a scheme to award artists and inventors. After an extensive and largely fruitless canvass, a meeting took place at Rawthmell's Coffee House, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, on 22 March 1754. Only ten persons besides Shipley, who acted as secretary, were present, but they confidently announced the foundation of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce and offered rewards for the discovery of cobalt, the raising and curing of madder, and for the best drawings by boys and girls [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94594', "Founders of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce")</script>]. In February 1755 Shipley sub-let two rooms to the society in a house he had rented in Craig's Court, Charing Cross, and in June 1756 he moved with the constantly expanding institution to John Fielding's house in Castle Court, Strand, and was briefly in residence in the magnificent premises designed for the society in 1759 by William Chambers.<br>
<br>Shipley remained secretary of the Society of Arts until 1757 and was its register (or curator) from 1757 to 1760. He had been elected a perpetual member in 1755 and received the honorary gold medal in 1758. After 1760 he remained active as a member. In 1762 he proposed, without success, the establishment of a &#145;repository of arts&#146;, but his scheme to increase the national supply of fish by stocking (1763) resulted in the society offering premiums for the establishment of scallop-beds. Even after he retired to Maidstone in 1768 he frequently travelled to London to attend meetings of committees of the society. He received the honorary silver medal in 1777 &#145;for his invention of a floating light&#146;. His method of insulating shoes from the damp by the use of tin foil (1781) and his improved gardening tools (1787) received the thanks of the society. An ambitious proposal to reform teaching methods resulted in the society's offer of a premium for teaching languages, and an award to Dr James Egan of Greenwich in 1787. On 1 July 1803, six months before his death, a ceremonial tribute was paid to Shipley at the society's prize-giving ceremony.<br>
<br>From 1754 to 1761 Shipley conducted a drawing school, first sharing premises with the Society of Arts and then at Beaufort Buildings in the Strand, where he rented a magnificent Great Room measuring 65 by 30 feet. Many artists of distinction were trained by him, including Richard Cosway, Ozias Humphry, John Hamilton Mortimer, Joseph Nollekens, and William Pars. The latter, with his brother Henry Pars, continued to manage the school after Shipley's retirement. In November 1767 he married Elizabeth Miller (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1806) at St George's, Hanover Square, and within a year was settled in Maidstone, Kent, where his friend and patron Lord Romney had his country seat. He made friends with his neighbours the Peale family, and his only surviving offspring, Elizabeth (1771&#150;1836), married Richard Peale junior. He was a member of the masonic Lodge of Fortitude and was the treasurer and probably the founder of the Maidstone Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Lord Romney was president and Benjamin Franklin, Arthur Young, and Richard Cosway were honorary members. In 1783 Shipley assisted the Maidstone Society's efforts to combat the outbreak of fever in the county goal and in 1786 he published his <span class="italic">Proposal to Establish a Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge in the County of Kent</span>, which led to the expansion of the Maidstone Society. In spite of his advancing years Shipley was active in the enlarged organization. In 1791 he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London and in 1795 he served on the governing committee of the reformed Kentish Society. In 1796 he resigned from the Linnean Society &#145;having scarce been in London since that time [his election]&#146;  (W. Shipley to T. Marsham, 9 May 1796, <span class="roman">Linn. Soc.</span>).<br>
<br>Shipley was known for his taciturnity and absent-mindedness. The miniature by William Hincks (1786), and the earlier portraits by James Barry (<i>c</i>.1779) and Richard Cosway (exh. Royal Society of Arts, 1760), confirm Joseph Moser's description of him as having &#145;something of the heavy appearance of the late Dr Johnson&#146;. Yet, continued Moser, &#145;under this unpromising aspect he possessed a most benevolent heart, joined to an inquisitive, intelligent and highly cultivated mind&#146;  (Moser, 176). His oil painting entitled <span class="italic">A Boy Blowing a Firebrand</span> after Schalcken (<i>c</i>.1751) and his miniature portrait of Henry Baker (before 1766) suggest that he was skilled at copying but hesitant at portraits. His landscape pictures remain untraced. Shipley probably retired from public life during the last eight years of his life. He died at Knightrider House, his home in Maidstone, on 28 December 1803, aged eighty-nine, and was buried at All Saints' Church, Maidstone.<br>
