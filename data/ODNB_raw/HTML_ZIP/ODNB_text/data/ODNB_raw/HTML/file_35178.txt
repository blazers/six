<span class="headword">Myers,  Leopold Hamilton</span>  (1881&#150;1944), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Leckhampton, Grange Road, Cambridge, on 6 September 1881, the eldest of the three children (two sons and a daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35177/', "Frederic William Henry Myers (1843&#150;1901)")</script>, writer and founder member of the Society for Psychical Research, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55520/', "Eveleen Tennant (1856&#150;1937)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101196/', "Tennant, Gertrude Barbara Rich")</script>], a renowned intellectual hostess and an experimenter with the early technology of photography. Myers was educated at Eton College, spent a year in Germany, and was then briefly at Trinity College, Cambridge, before his father's death in January 1901. He then accompanied his mother on a trip to the United States, where she was to have a pre-arranged &#145;after-death&#146; meeting with her husband. The meeting failed to materialize. Myers met and proposed to Elsie (1873&#150;1955), daughter of General William Jackson Palmer, founder of the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Elsie Palmer was nine years older than Myers, and he had to wait seven years before she agreed to marry him in 1908. The couple had two daughters and lived in Marlow in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Myers came to literature comparatively late and wrote slowly. His first published work was <span class="italic">Arvat</span> (1908), a play in verse. During the First World War he worked in the trade department of the Foreign Office. His first novel, <span class="italic">The Orissers</span> (1922), is an account of the relations between a poor aristocratic family and a family involved in the City. In 1925 he published <span class="italic">The Clio</span> about the tensions among the passengers of a luxury yacht travelling up the Amazon. Myers's great work, however, is a sequence of novels set in India in the reign of Akbar. Focusing on a young prince's life and spiritual quest at the corrupt political centre of an empire, the series included <span class="italic">The Near and the Far</span>, <span class="italic">Prince Jali</span>, <span class="italic">The Root and the Flower</span>, <span class="italic">Rajah Amar</span>, and <span class="italic">The Pool of Vishnu</span>. <span class="italic">The Root and the Flower</span> won the Femina Vie Heureuse and James Tait Black prizes after its publication in 1935. The novels were collected in Britain in 1943 as <span class="italic">The Near and the Far</span> and in the United States in 1945 as <span class="italic">The Root and the Flower</span>. Although the series is set in sixteenth-century India, Myers was cavalier with historical facts and stressed that he was using a historical setting to address contemporary issues:<blockquote>It has certainly not been my intention to set aside the social and ethical problems that force themselves upon us at the present time. On the contrary, my hope has been that we might view them better from the distant vantage ground of an imaginary world.</blockquote>Myers paid a great deal of attention to his public image; his manners and grooming were meticulous and his clothes expensively tailored. His character, however, was often painfully contradictory. A contemplative searcher for spiritual truths, he was nevertheless extremely sociable and active first in the Bloomsbury group (E. M. Forster found him &#145;chilly&#146;), and then among the left-wing intelligentsia of the thirties (a friend of Orwell and J. D. Bernal). He could be a vicious snob and became very angry with his daughter for not marrying a peer. Myers read a great deal of philosophy while maintaining a strong prejudice against &#145;dry&#146; academics. While he suffered from depression, he could, particularly as a young man, be gregarious and playful. He visited Egypt, Italy, Ceylon, and other countries, raced at Brooklands, flew in a balloon, and idled at social gatherings and fashionable restaurants funded by an inheritance he received from a godfather in 1906 which left him wealthy enough not to have to work.<br>
<br>Myers's writing is often concerned with spirituality and religious philosophy. After the death of his father he had a mystical experience in a hotel bedroom in Chicago, and as he became older this became proof to him that experiences beyond the rational did occur. Yet he could never submit himself to the discipline of any specific religious faith. Instead he trawled widely through writings on Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism and on Freudian, Adlerian, and especially Jungian psychology. In later life he became a communist and, although he never visited Russia, he looked on it as a spiritual utopia, commenting in one letter, &#145;Stalin's birthday: God bless him&#146; and in another, in reference to the Red Army general, &#145;our hearts are with Timoschenko, and our attitude: who dies if Russia lives?&#146; Myers tried to express his new faith in a semi-sociological work that was abandoned before it was finished. Following this failure he managed to complete a class-conscious autobiography. Almost as soon as he had finished, he turned against it and rounded up all the copies he had distributed to his friends and publishers before destroying every one.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Leopold Myers became increasingly isolated and depressed. On the night of 7 April 1944 he committed suicide by taking an overdose of a commercial sedative, Veronal. He was found dead on the morning of the 8th at his home, Tylecotes, Oxford Road, Marlow-on-Thames, and was cremated without a ceremony on Saturday 15 April in Reading.<br>
