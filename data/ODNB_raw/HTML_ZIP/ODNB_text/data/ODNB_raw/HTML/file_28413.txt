<span class="headword">Wakefield,  Daniel</span>  (1776&#150;1846), <span class="occ">barrister and writer on political economy</span>, was born in the spring of 1776, in Tottenham, Middlesex. He was the youngest of three children in the family of Edward Wakefield (1750&#150;1826), merchant, and his wife, the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28420/', "Priscilla Wakefield (1750&#150;1832)")</script>, daughter of Daniel Bell. Daniel Wakefield's elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28414/', "Edward Wakefield")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28415/', "Edward Gibbon Wakefield")</script> was his nephew. Wakefield was privately educated by scholars of some eminence. One tutor, Stewart Kyd, was later tried for high treason with Horne Tooke. His commitment to Quakerism, despite the influence of his mother, was not strong and he abandoned it for the Church of England at a relatively young age, partly in the hope of qualifying for employment with the government. In 1798 he did gain a part-time post in the naval pay office; but the wage was poor and he despaired of further advancement. Other attention-seeking schemes included pamphlets on political economy, urging poorly conceived reforms of the public finance system. Expensive schemes for the reclamation of Irish bogs similarly proved unrewarding. In 1799 he published the most important of his works, <span class="italic">An Essay of Political Economy</span>, an inquiry into the various French schools of writing on value.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1802 Wakefield became a student of Lincoln's Inn. His commitment to the legal profession must, however, be doubted as various distractions, riotous living, and, according to his mother, unsuitable company prevented much headway. An ill-advised marriage on 3 June 1805 to Isabella Mackie, an adventuress and swindler, followed. It dragged him into a morass of debt and fraud that almost ended in bankruptcy and emigration. Remarkably, his legal career was not destroyed and he was called to the bar on 2 May 1807. A sullied reputation and an inadequate knowledge of the law, however, meant that clients were not plentiful and his financial dependence upon his parents and brother continued. Attempts to annul the marriage failed; then, in August 1813, Isabella committed suicide by taking poison. On 11 November that year Wakefield married Elizabeth Kilgour. Neither marriage produced children. Poverty had made him a diligent student and the past six years had not been wasted. With his newly acquired respectability and demonstrable skill, his practice flourished. He became known as one of the ablest equity draftsmen of his day and was often consulted in major cases. He was elected bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 15 January 1835, having become king's counsel during the previous Michaelmas vacation. His most famous brief was, perhaps, <i>Attwood v. Small</i>. The dispute concerned the sale of an ironworks whose price was over &pound;1 million. It was appealed to the House of Lords in 1838 and his successful argument won him a considerable reputation, a silk gown from the lord chancellor, and &pound;5000 from the grateful John Attwood.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career, Wakefield became known for his philanthropy. At times, he refused payment for briefs and returned fees to clients in distress. His eminence was recognized by his involvement in the administration of the inn and in the planning and construction of the new hall. His country residence was at Hare Hatch, near Twyford, Berkshire, where he was magistrate and deputy lieutenant. Wakefield died suddenly on 19 July 1846, in London, while taking a shower. He was buried on 23 July 1846 in the crypt of Lincoln's Inn chapel.<br>
