<span class="headword">Shudi <span class="st"> [Tschudi]</span>,  Burkat</span>  (1702&#150;1773), <span class="occ">harpsichord maker</span>, was born at Schwanden in the canton of Glarus, Switzerland, on 13 March 1702, the second son of Joshua (or Josua) Tschudi, wool merchant, surgeon, and councillor of Schwanden. His mother's maiden name was Elmer. The Tschudi family believed it could trace its origins back to a Johann Tschudi who in 870 had supposedly been mayor of Glarus, while another ancestor, Heinrich (1074&#150;1149), had been appointed landholding tenant of the Glarus region in 1128.<br>
<br>Because of the local abundance of wood, the main trade in Glarus was the making of wooden frames for school slates and various articles of furniture. A shortage of wood supplies in the early eighteenth century, however, the result of deforestation, led several woodworkers to become wood merchants. Many families were put out of business when the local parliament decreed that for ten years no wood might be sold outside the country. Despite the flexibility shown by some in becoming cotton weavers, the young Shudi could see little future in remaining at Glarus, and at the age of sixteen, having been taught joinery and cabinet-making by his uncle, he emigrated to London. There at some time in the 1720s he was apprenticed to Hermann Tabel, the Flemish-born harpsichord maker whose apprentices also included Jacob Kirkman.<br>
<br>Shudi's earliest surviving instrument, closely based on Tabel's only extant one of 1721, is a two-manual harpsichord of 1729, which carries on the reverse of the nameboard the inscription: &#145;QUESTO CIMBALO &Eacute; DEL<sup>a</sup> SIG<sup>ra</sup> ANNA STRADA 1731, LONDON&#146;. It is believed that the instrument was given to Anna Strada, a celebrated singer, by Handel, with whom Shudi was friendly. Since Tabel had been trained in the workshop of the Couchets in Antwerp, the 1729 Shudi harpsichord is a direct link with those of the Flemish tradition. Shudi must have been free of Tabel by 1729, and it was at about this time that he married Catherine Wild (1704&#150;<i>c</i>.1758), daughter of Hans Jakob and Salome Wild (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kubli), natives of Schwanden by then resident in London. Following his first wife's death he married Elizabeth Meier.<br>
<br>Shudi's business was at first conducted from his house at what is now 1 Meards Street, off Dean Street. Later, in 1742, he moved to 33 Great Pulteney Street, where his sign displayed the plume of feathers, a reflection of the patronage of Frederick, prince of Wales, which he enjoyed. The two-manual harpsichord he made in 1740 for the prince has been on view at Kew Palace. It was probably in 1745 that the German painter Marcus Tuscher executed the charming and well-known portrait of the Shudi family. Shudi made a total of five harpsichords for Frederick the Great of Prussia, and it is thought that the first, of about 1745, is the one illustrated in the Tuscher painting. In 1761 a young Scottish cabinet-maker, John Broadwood, was apprenticed to Shudi; he married Shudi's daughter, Barbara, in 1769 and later in the same year was taken into partnership by Shudi. Thereafter the harpsichords made by the firm were signed &#145;Burkat Shudi et Johannes Broadwood&#146; and continued to be signed thus even after Shudi's retirement in 1771 to a house in Charlotte Street and his death at the same house on 19 August 1773.<br>
<br>Shudi made instruments similar to those of Kirkman, usually in traditional English cases with exteriors of panels of walnut or mahogany, surrounded with ornamental stringing and cross-banding. The majority of the surviving harpsichords have two manuals with the specification of two 8 foot registers and one 4 foot, and a lute register available on the upper manual. Single-manual instruments were also made with two 8 foot and one 4 foot or simply two 8 foot registers. Machine stops and buff (or harp) stops are to be found, and some of the more elaborate harpsichords have the Venetian swell (patented by Shudi on 18 December 1769). It seems that Shudi also collaborated with Samuel Green and John Snetzler in the making of claviorgana. By good fortune a sizeable amount of archival material concerning the production of the Shudi and later the Shudi and Broadwood workshops survives, from which it is clear that instruments were made for a number of famous people in eighteenth-century England and were also exported to many parts of Europe and beyond.<br>
