<span class="headword">Bolton, Sir  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1806), <span class="occ">tutor and inventor of gun-locks</span>, was the son of David Bolton. He was schooled in military tactics and mathematics preparatory to a career in the army, but was instead appointed instructor to the royal princesses in writing, geography, and arithmetic. Being of independent means, he indulged his interest in firearms by seeking to improve the musket gun-lock, which in both military and sporting firearms was so defective that accidents were frequently caused by guns going off at half-cock in the heat of battle or when forging through dense vegetation. The self-acting and detached bolting lock that he designed was constructed by mathematical instrument makers (whom he found more obedient to his orders than the gun makers), and patented in 1795 (no. 2041). The Board of Ordnance had several examples made for trial at Woolwich, but although their performance was deemed admirable, cost ruled out their general adoption. Bolton designed a simpler version, both models being described in his <span class="italic">Remarks on the present defective state of fire-arms, with an explanation of a newly invented patented gun-lock</span> (1795); the locks were obtainable from the gunsmith Fisher of High Holborn.<br>
<br>Bolton married at Marylebone, London, on 2 October 1794, Catherine Bannatyne, a widow; she was the daughter and heiress of John Lawley and had at least one daughter from a previous marriage. The marriage produced two daughters and a son. Through this marriage Bolton inherited the Upper Diamond estate in St Vincent and at least fifty-three enslaved people who lived on it. In March 1799 Bolton let it be known in court circles that he was about to depart for the West Indies and would be much assisted in his intended business (which was not disclosed) by a knighthood. George III duly knighted him on 3 April 1799. Bolton described in a codicil to his will, written in 1805, that the estate had been &#145;laid waste&#146; by the slave revolt of 1795, and it was to rescue this inheritance that he sailed to the West Indies on 7 December 1800. He received a loan of &pound;5700 from the commissioners of the St Vincent and Grenada relief funds, and borrowed large but unspecified sums from his father; by 1805 he claimed to have invested &pound;20,000 in his St Vincent property. These actions appear to have brought about a disagreement with his wife, and he specified that in the event of his death she was to have no influence on the education of their children. In 1805 he purchased and completed the building of Tutshill House in Tidenham, Gloucestershire. The burial at Tidenham of Dido, &#145;a female negro belonging to Sir George Bolton&#146; was recorded in November 1805. News of Bolton's death in St Vincent, where he was collector of customs, reached England at the end of December 1806 and his will was proved by his father in London in January 1807.<br>
