<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Patrick,  Robert William  Cochran-</span>  (1842&#150;1897), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the only son of William Charles Richard Patrick (afterwards Cochran-Patrick) of Waterside, Ayrshire, and Agnes, eldest daughter of William Cochran of Ladyland and Belltrees, was born at Ladyland, Ayrshire, on 5 February 1842. Having received his early education from private tutors, he matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1857, where he secured prizes in classics, logic, and moral philosophy, graduating BA in 1861, and passing first in metaphysics and logic. In 1861 he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where his friends included Henry Fawcett, Leslie Stephen, and Robert Romer. He became captain of one of the boats of the hall, and carried off the university challenge cup for walking and other athletic prizes. As a volunteer he shot in a winning four with Edward Ross, the first queen's prizeman, and was a member of the amateur dramatic club, then under the management of F. C. Burnand. In 1864 he graduated LLB. On leaving Cambridge, he returned to Edinburgh for a year, with a view to qualifying for the Scottish bar, an idea he soon abandoned.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1866 Cochran-Patrick married Eleanora, younger daughter of Robert Hunter of Hunterston, Ayrshire. She died in 1884 having borne a son, William Arthur (<i>d</i>. 1891) and a daughter, Eleanor Agnes, who married in 1895 Neil James Kennedy, advocate. On his marriage, Cochran-Patrick settled at Woodside in Ayrshire, a property left him by his great-uncle. With a strong bent for sport and natural history, he was in his element as a country gentleman, also throwing himself with vigour into local and county business. He became a captain in the militia, chairman of the parish school and parochial boards, served as convener of the finance committee of the county, and occupied other public posts.<br>
<br>Taking up the study of archaeology, Cochran-Patrick became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and contributed many papers to the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the society. In 1871 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1874 he was sent to Stockholm to represent Great Britain at the International Congress of Archaeology. In 1874 he was one of the founders of the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archaeological Association. To the collections of this society he contributed numerous articles. But it is as a numismatist that Cochran-Patrick is best known, and his collection of Scottish coins was wellnigh unrivalled. On this subject in 1876 he published his first book, entitled <span class="italic">Records of the Coinage of Scotland from the Earliest Period to the Union</span> (2 vols.). This he followed up in 1878 with <span class="italic">Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland</span>, in which he gave an account of the discovery of gold in Scotland, and descriptions of the lead and silver mines. In 1884 he published his third work, <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Medals of Scotland</span>, containing a learned account of Scottish medals, of which he preserved the best collection then extant. He published several other works on Scottish coins, and <span class="italic">Medieval Scotland</span> (1892), a reprint of newspaper articles.<br>
<br>In 1880 Cochran-Patrick contested North Ayrshire as a Conservative, and defeated J. B. Balfour (afterwards first Baron Kinross) by fifty-five votes. He was a frequent speaker in parliament, especially on education matters. In 1885 he was defeated for North Ayrshire by H. F. Elliot. In 1886 he became assessor to St Andrews University, and in 1887 a commissioner to inquire into the working of the <span class="roman">Scottish Education Act</span>. Shortly afterwards he joined the fishery board of Scotland, and was granted the degree of LLD from Glasgow University for his scholarly attainments. In December 1887 he was appointed permanent under-secretary for Scotland, an office in which he rendered most valuable assistance in the promotion of Scottish business, notably the <span class="roman">Local Government (Scotl.) Act</span>, 1889. On 15 June 1892 he resigned his appointment owing to failing health, and retired to Woodside. In 1894 he acted as a commissioner to inquire into the Tweed and Solway salmon fisheries, visiting the border towns, taking evidence, and inspecting the rivers. In 1896 he became vice-chairman of the Scottish Fishery Board. As a freemason he was for many years provincial grand master of Ayrshire. On 15 March 1897, after returning from a meeting of the fishery board in Edinburgh, he died suddenly of heart disease at Woodside. His son-in-law assumed the name of Cochran-Patrick in terms of the entail of the property.<br>
