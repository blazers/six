<span class="headword">Tetley,  Henry Greenwood</span>  (1851&#150;1921), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, on 20 September 1851, the son of Samuel Tetley, a stuff merchant, and his wife, Catherine. After working for over twenty years at the big textile firm of S. C. Lister &amp; Co. and having risen to be head of the silk department, in 1893 he accepted the offer of a post in Essex with Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co., makers of silk mourning crape. The firm's profits had recently slumped badly, and it had become evident that drastic change was needed in order to modernize production and sales methods as well as to regain profitability. Tetley was brought in to reorganize the manufacturing end of the business. He in turn introduced a new sales manager, Thomas Paul Latham, from Manchester. Both became directors in 1895. These two men, wholly outsiders to a family firm, were to direct its destiny for the next quarter-century, with Tetley as the driving force.<br>
<br>Tetley set about reforming production methods with much gusto. Old machinery was scrapped; the isolation of the company in Essex was broken down as new managers were imported from the textile areas of northern England and as production was started in Lancashire; new lines of coloured fabrics were developed. Losses were turned into profits. But the level of profitability was still only moderate and by 1904 it had become evident that a plateau had been reached. It was then that Tetley succeeded in the first of two striking business gambles. First, he persuaded his fellow directors that Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co. should buy the patent rights to the new viscose process, a British invention for making what was then called artificial silk and later became known as rayon, the first successful man-made fibre. In July 1904 the patents were bought for approximately &pound;25,000. Tetley made it clear to the board that the aim was to find a new source of profits for the company. To that end a new factory was set up, in Coventry. Sundry teething problems, technical and managerial, were overcome, and the profitability that followed was remarkable: a 6 per cent dividend in 1904 had become 30 per cent in 1911 and 50 per cent in 1912. Some part of this bounteous distribution arose from the second of Tetley's business gambles: the purchase in June 1909 for approximately &pound;31,000 of the American rights to the viscose process and the establishment of an American subsidiary which started rayon production inside the US tariff barrier in 1911. The way in which he acquired the American rights represented so shrewd a piece of opportunism as to be not far from sharp practice. He had earlier made an agreement for technical co-operation with the holders of the French viscose rights, and in 1906 an international consortium came into being. In 1908&#150;9 the holder of the American rights sought technical help and entry into the consortium. Tetley was entrusted with the task of negotiating with him on the consortium's behalf. He proceeded to exploit the fact that Courtauld &amp; Co. were far the most successful members of the consortium by simply buying up the rights for his own company, leaving thereby some very aggrieved Frenchmen to be mollified by Latham. The profits being earned by the parent company and its American subsidiary were so big that in 1913 a new company, Courtaulds Ltd, was floated with an issued capital of &pound;2 million. A series of bonus issues raised it to &pound;12 million by 1920. Courtaulds had become the world's largest rayon producer. Tetley was primarily responsible for that achievement, and in 1917 he appropriately became chairman of the company.<br>
<br>By all accounts, Tetley was an aggressive man with a furious temper. He had a relentless energy for business, trampling on obstacles and people in the course of putting his ideas into practice. While he was periodically precipitate and sometimes bombastic, his partnership with Latham provides a good example of the co-operation of opposites. His unswerving devotion to matters of business is apparent in numerous letters; always lucid and straightforward, they bombarded colleagues and subordinates with orders, plans, and demands for information. Tetley was a self-made man whose efforts brought him a fortune, but neither his will nor his correspondence suggest any noteworthy outside interests. The date of his marriage, the identity of his wife, Charlotte, and details of his family life remain unknown. He served as president of the Silk Association but took no part in public affairs. He maintained a house in London, at 17 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, and died at his country residence, Alderbrook, Cranleigh, in Surrey, on 21 August 1921. No <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary marked his death, but two months later his substantial wealth was noted among the wills recorded in that paper. Apart from some small legacies and bequests to such patriotic or charitable institutions as his trustees might select, the bulk of his fortune went to his wife, Charlotte, and his children.<br>
