<span class="headword">Calder,  Fanny Louisa</span>  (1838&#150;1923), <span class="occ">promoter of education in domestic subjects</span>, was born on 26 March 1838, at 26 Rodney Street, Liverpool, the youngest of the eleven children of James Calder and his wife, Jane Elizabeth Mitchell. Her father was a cotton merchant and the family had lived in South Carolina for many years before settling in Liverpool about 1835.<br>
<br>A devout Anglican, in youth Fanny followed a common pattern of women's voluntary work, Sunday school teaching, and running a <span class="roman">Bible</span> class for mothers. While working with the poor she formulated the philanthropic enterprise that was to become her life's work. &#145;In my early days of social work &hellip; I soon learnt that the too evident degraded condition of the women and girls &hellip; was not from poverty in the main, but from absolute ignorance of the essential methods of &#147;making a home&#148;&#146;  (&#145;The F. L. Calder College of Domestic Science&#146;, F. L. Calder College archives). Aged thirty-six, she formed a committee of like-minded women to organize cookery teaching in Liverpool, and for the next fifty years single-mindedly promulgated the systematic teaching of domestic skills to women and girls.<br>
<br>The Ladies Committee formed in 1874, of which she remained honorary secretary until her death, inaugurated the Liverpool School of Cookery in the following year by running classes at St George's Hall, Liverpool, with the aim of training educated women to teach cookery around the city and beyond. Miss Calder was soon convinced that teaching adults would not herald improvements in the conditions of the poor. She persuaded local elementary board- and church-school managers to support her experimental schemes of instruction and allow the teaching of cookery to girls. The school's staff and members of the committee ran demonstration and practice classes in all types of cookery. The unrealized hope was that the income from classes attended by wealthy women would subsidize the training of teachers and the direct work with children.<br>
<br>In parallel Miss Calder began the task of persuading local and national education authorities to support the teaching. She worked with her Ladies Committee at the school, and with the founders of similar schools throughout England and Scotland, to promote the training of women who would provide practical programmes of instruction in the growing elementary school system. With representatives of the Yorkshire, Edinburgh, and Glasgow schools of cookery she founded the Northern Union of Training Schools of Cookery in 1876. This organization issued teaching diplomas, and worked to standardize instruction and to persuade the education department to develop the teaching. &#145;There was a great deal of difficulty in persuading educationalists that the duties of home life could be systematised and organised as practical science&#146;, she recalled  (Calder, 318). The education code of 1882 admitted practical cookery as a grant-earning subject. After continual pressure from Miss Calder and others in the domestic subjects movement, laundry work was added to the code in 1890, and the 1880s and 1890s saw the steady growth of practical domestic training in schools.<br>
<br>Miss Calder was instrumental in founding the movement's first national organization, the Association of Teachers of Domestic Science in 1897. This organization furthered the work of popularizing and professionalizing domestic subjects, and by 1914 had more than 1300 members. The Liverpool school remained in the forefront, and in 1898 the duchess of York became its patron. In 1903, in recognition of her work, Miss Calder was invited to join the new Liverpool education committee. A tall and striking woman, she was nevertheless unassuming and reserved. She attended committee meetings conscientiously, but rarely spoke. Yet in her propagandizing of cookery teaching she noted, &#145;I visited many cities and villages, explaining possibilities to large gatherings of ladies and gentlemen interested in the welfare of the people. &hellip; In fact I missionised the subject&#146;  (&#145;The F. L. Calder College of Domestic Science&#146;, F. L. Calder College archives). She also wrote articles and letters about her mission, promoted the distribution of cheap cookery books produced at the school, and co-authored with E. E. Mann, head cookery teacher at the school, what was probably the first laundry work teaching manual, <span class="italic">A Teachers' Manual of Elementary Laundry Work</span> (1891).<br>
<br>Miss Calder's efforts to develop national regulation of the training of teachers of domestic subjects met with less success, and the Liverpool school, like others, continued to be privately funded until the first decades of the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, therefore, much of Miss Calder's energies were devoted to the financial and curriculum management of the school, and she doggedly pursued benefactors to ensure the expansion of its work. Development was expensive, however, and reluctantly in 1920, unable to continue to subsidize the Liverpool school from the private purses of her committee, she requested Liverpool education authority to continue the work. In her honour the school was renamed the F. L. Calder College of Domestic Science.<br>
<br>While Millicent Garrett Fawcett believed that the &#145;new born zeal for needlework and cookery &hellip; has arisen mainly as an offshoot of the &#147;women's rights&#148; movement&#146;  (M. G. Fawcett, &#145;The future of Englishwomen: a reply&#146;, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, 4, 1878, 354), late twentieth-century historians have disputed the significance of the domestic subjects movement. The place of domestic ideology and work in women's lives is a contentious issue. Fanny Louisa Calder's contemporaries, however, acknowledged her personal and local achievements for women's education when, in 1913, Liverpool University conferred upon her the degree of MA <i>honoris causa</i> in education. Her life has a wider significance as that of one of the many single, mid-Victorian, middle-class, philanthropically inspired women who worked in education with a zealous and often crusading commitment to raise the status of women's household work. In 1892 Florence Nightingale wrote to her, &#145;Good speed to your great work&#151;Saint of the Laundry, Cooking and Health&#146;  (F. Nightingale to Fanny Calder, 21 Nov 1892, copy in F. L. Calder College archives). Fanny Calder died at her home, 49 Canning Street, Liverpool, on 6 June 1923, and was buried at Smithdown Road cemetery in Liverpool.<br>
