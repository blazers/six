</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Digby,  John</span>, first earl of Bristol  (1580&#150;1653), <span class="occ">diplomat and politician</span>, was born in February 1580, the fourth and youngest son of Sir George Digby (<i>d</i>. 1586), of Coleshill, Warwickshire, and of Abigail Heveningham of Ketteringham, Norfolk. He became a fellow-commoner of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1595, and was created an MA on 30 August 1605. He was also admitted to the Inner Temple in 1598. In November 1605 Lord Harrington, who had charge of Princess Elizabeth, sent Digby to inform the king that the gunpowder plotters' plan to seize Elizabeth had failed. James took a liking to Digby and made him a gentleman of the privy chamber and a carver. Digby was knighted on 16 March 1607, and on 31 May 1609 he married Beatrice or Beatrix (1574?&#150;1658), daughter of Charles Walcot of Walcot in Shropshire, and widow of Sir John Dyve of Bromham in Bedfordshire.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoSpain16101618"></a>Ambassador to Spain, 1610&#150;1618</h2>In October 1610 Digby was appointed resident ambassador in Madrid, and arrived there in June 1611. He succeeded in obtaining concessions for English merchants trading with Spain, but James I's hopes of a marriage alliance between Prince Henry and the infanta Anne, daughter of Philip III, were dashed when Digby learned that she was already engaged to Louis XIII of France. Then, in November 1612, Prince Henry died. In 1613 Digby uncovered details of the pensions that the Spanish court had paid to prominent figures in England, and early the following year he returned to London to present this information to James.<br>
<br>Later in 1614 James decided to propose a match between Prince Charles and Philip III's youngest daughter, the infanta Maria, and Digby was sent back to Madrid to pursue the negotiations. Despite his private conviction that the prince should marry a protestant, Digby wished to see a good understanding between the protestant and Catholic powers of Europe, and was determined to promote the negotiations to the best of his ability. However, early in 1616 he was again summoned home, following the fall of the earl of Somerset, to give evidence of the disgraced favourite's links with Spain. He arrived in March, and candidly informed James that he thought it unwise to proceed further in the marriage negotiations given that the king of Spain could not dispose of his daughter's hand without papal consent. It is likely that James appreciated Digby's frankness, and further preferment quickly followed: on 3 April he was made vice-chamberlain of the royal household and was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>In May 1617 James nevertheless dispatched Digby back to Madrid to open formal marriage negotiations, and he left in August. Digby once again threw himself into the task and tried to obtain the best terms possible, especially with regard to the bride's portion, which James wished to fix at not less than &pound;500,000. Matters such as the arrangements for the infanta's future household were successfully resolved, but the issue of liberty of conscience for English Catholics was reserved for James's own decision. In April 1618 Digby was able to return to England with the news that the infanta's portion would be &pound;600,000. He was rewarded on 25 November 1618 by being created Baron Digby of Sherborne. However, James refused to sanction liberty of conscience for English Catholics, and the marriage negotiation was suspended.<h2>
<a name="Diplomacy16201622"></a>Diplomacy, 1620&#150;1622</h2>Early in 1620 James asked Digby for advice concerning the crisis that had arisen on the continent following the election of the king's son-in-law, Frederick, elector palatine, to the Bohemian throne. Digby apparently advocated the search for an understanding with Spain while also making preparations for the defence of the palatinate. In June 1620 he accompanied Buckingham on a visit to the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, at which the possible partition of the Dutch republic between England and Spain was discussed. Digby's hostility towards the Dutch did not, however, imply subservience to Spain, and in March 1621, following Frederick's expulsion from Bohemia, Digby was sent to Brussels to urge the Archduke Albert to mediate a cessation of arms.<br>
<br>On 23 May, shortly after his return to England, Digby was instructed to embark on a mission to the emperor, Ferdinand II. He was authorized to make peace on the basis that Frederick would abandon his claims to Bohemia while in return Ferdinand would not seek to punish him. Digby reached Vienna on 4 July and initially the talks appeared to go well. However, by the end of September the duke of Bavaria had occupied the upper palatinate in the emperor's name, and Frederick's forces were obliged to retreat to the lower palatinate. Digby left Vienna soon afterwards, and on his way home visited Frederick at Heidelberg in mid-October. By the end of the month he was back in England, and his return prompted James to reconvene parliament on 20 November. The next day Digby addressed both houses: he &#145;narrated his embassage and the state of the Lower Palatinate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 222) and urged parliament to prepare forces for the relief of the lower palatinate, costing &pound;900,000. However, before this proposal could be fully debated, James quarrelled with the House of Commons over the issue of free speech and promptly dissolved the parliament. This seriously weakened England's bargaining position by ensuring that threats of military force could not be backed up in practice.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortoSpain16221624"></a>Ambassador to Spain, 1622&#150;1624</h2>In February 1622 Digby was again instructed to return to Spain, where Philip IV had succeeded his father the previous year. Digby resumed the marriage negotiations that had been in abeyance since 1618, and on 15 September was rewarded with the earldom of Bristol. By January 1623 the marriage articles were sufficiently far advanced, except the one relating to toleration for English Catholics, for James to feel able to accept them. Bristol was unable to secure a Spanish promise that the palatinate would be restored, and he was convinced that the goodwill of Spain afforded the best chance of restitution.<br>
<br>On 7 March 1623 Prince Charles and the marquess of Buckingham arrived at Bristol's residence at Madrid, thereby taking negotiations out of Bristol's hands. He appears to have deeply offended the prince by believing a rumour that Charles had come with the purpose of declaring himself a Catholic, and by expressing his willingness to collude in this. During the course of the visit Bristol persisted in his attempts to maintain good relations with Spain, and he further alienated Charles by supporting a scheme for educating the elector palatine's eldest son in Vienna. He also incurred Buckingham's lasting enmity when, on 29 August, he wrote to James describing the &#145;high &hellip; dislike&#146; that Philip IV and his ministers felt towards the newly created duke  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous State Papers, 1501&#150;1726</span>, 1.477). By the time they left for home in September Buckingham and Charles were thoroughly hostile to Spain, and believed that Bristol had been far too easily taken in by vague assurances from Philip and his chief minister, Olivares.<br>
<br>When Charles departed from Madrid he left Bristol with a proxy authorizing him to appear in the marriage ceremony on his behalf, but shortly afterwards he ordered him not to use this without further instructions. Bristol continued to try to avert the breach with Spain on which Charles and Buckingham were now set. In October James insisted that the marriage would have to be postponed until satisfactory assurances were received regarding the restitution of the palatinate, and Bristol only conveyed this ultimatum to Olivares with great reluctance. By this time Bristol's wish to preserve relations with Spain diverged so strongly from the prevailing mood at the English court that on 30 December he was recalled. He formally took his leave of Philip IV on 29 January 1624. Before he left Olivares offered him a blank piece of paper on which he invited Bristol to write down anything that he wished in the way of favours or protection as a mark of the king's gratitude. Bristol courteously declined, saying that he had acted out of loyalty to the English crown and &#145;would rather offer himself to the slaughter in England than be duke of Infantado in Spain&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, <span class="italic">History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603&#150;1642</span>, 10 vols., 1883&#150;4, 5.165).<h2>
<a name="Politicaltroubles16241628"></a>Political troubles, 1624&#150;1628</h2>Meanwhile Buckingham was deeply fearful that if Bristol had an audience with James he would reveal damaging information about the duke's conduct in Madrid. He therefore ensured that when Bristol landed at Dover he received instructions to &#145;retyer yourselfe to your house or lodgeing&#146;  (&#145;Defence&#146;, v). Bristol went, under virtual house arrest, to his home in St Giles' Fields, but he refused to admit any error on his part and declared his willingness to stand trial before parliament. Buckingham successfully resisted this request. Instead, Bristol was sent a list of twenty interrogatories relating to his conduct to which he replied in detail, demonstrating that he had at no time acted without James's prior knowledge or subsequent approval. However, though Bristol was granted permission to return to Sherborne in July, he was neither brought to trial nor set at liberty, despite his repeated pleas to the king and to Buckingham.<br>
<br>On the accession of Charles I in March 1625 Bristol was removed from the privy council, and in June Charles instructed him not to attend parliament, his writ of summons notwithstanding. In January 1626 Bristol asked to attend Charles's coronation. The king retaliated by accusing Bristol of trying to make him convert to Catholicism while in Madrid. Bristol reiterated his willingness to stand trial, but Charles then denied him a writ of summons to the parliament that assembled in February 1626. On 22 March Bristol submitted a petition to the House of Lords, requesting either to be summoned to parliament or to be placed on trial. The Lords' committee on privileges upheld his right to take his seat, whereupon Charles grudgingly issued a writ of summons but intimated, via a letter from Lord Keeper Coventry, that &#145;your Lordship's personal attendance is to be forborn&#146;  (&#145;Defence&#146;, xxxv). Bristol replied, sardonically, that the monarch's writ of summons must take precedence over the lord keeper's letter, and promptly journeyed to Westminster.<br>
<br>Having taken his seat in the Lords, Bristol indicated his wish to bring charges against Buckingham. Charles immediately instructed the attorney-general to charge Bristol with high treason, and on 1 May he was brought to the bar of the House of Lords. Bristol at once presented twelve specific charges against Buckingham, including that of bringing Prince Charles to Spain with the purpose of converting him to Catholicism, and of conspiring with the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, to this end. The Lords ordered that consideration of the king's charges against Bristol and of Bristol's charges against Buckingham should proceed simultaneously. However, these proceedings were brought to an abrupt halt by the king's dissolution of parliament in June. Bristol was then sent to the Tower, pending prosecution before the Star Chamber. Shortly afterwards he fell ill and Charles and Buckingham, fearing the damaging revelations that a trial was likely to bring, used the earl's illness as an excuse to postpone the case indefinitely. In September 1626, probably through the earl of Pembroke's intervention, Bristol was allowed to return to his home at Sherborne, but he remained under house arrest.<br>
<br>When Charles's third parliament met in March 1628 the Lords insisted that Bristol be set at liberty and restored to his place in the upper house. In the debates over the king's powers of imprisonment without cause shown, which ultimately gave rise to the petition of right, Bristol attempted to secure a compromise and argued that certain royal discretionary powers were necessary for use in emergencies. As he reportedly put it on 22 April: &#145;As Christ upon the Sabbath healed&#146; (thus breaking Jewish law for the greater good), &#145;so the prerogative is to be preserved for the preservation of the whole&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings in Parliament, 1628</span>, 5.327). The Lords accepted this proposal, but it was rejected by the Commons. When the Commons sent the petition to the Lords, Bristol again sought a compromise. However, on 20 May he came out against the idea of incorporating a clause saving the royal prerogative, and suggested instead that such a saving should be verbal  (ibid., 483&#150;4). He allegedly regarded the king's first answer (2 June) as &#145;rather a waiving of the petition than any way satisfactory to it&#146;  (ibid., 598), and demanded a fuller and better answer.<h2>
<a name="Politicalrehabilitation"></a>Political rehabilitation</h2>Following the end of the 1628 session Bristol regained a certain amount of favour, and payment of his ambassador's pension, which had fallen into arrears, was resumed. However, for most of Charles I's personal rule he seems to have lived quietly at Sherborne, and a fuller rehabilitation&#151;for which he gave the credit to the earl of Holland&#151;did not occur until August 1637. He apparently played no further part in public affairs until the spring of 1639, when Charles summoned the peers to assist his expedition against the Scots. In May Bristol vainly tried to dissuade the king from advancing against Berwick with such a poorly prepared army. The following month he warned Charles that most peers wished to see parliament recalled, and was influential in persuading the king to pursue the talks with the Scots that led to the pacification of Berwick. After the dissolution of the Short Parliament he advocated the calling of another parliament, though he refused to have anything to do with the twelve peers who in August 1640 petitioned the king to recall parliament. He played a prominent part in the great council of peers which Charles summoned to meet at York on 24 September. In particular, he moved for&#151;and was appointed to&#151;a committee of sixteen peers to conduct negotiations with the Scots, and these talks occupied most of his time over the next few months.<br>
<br>Unsympathetic towards the Scots, and deeply resentful of their interference in English affairs, Bristol's main hope seems to have been that Charles would cut his losses by reaching a settlement with them as rapidly as possible. In a speech on 12 January 1641 he attached particular blame to &#145;the improvidence and evill counsells of certaine badd instruments, who had reduced his roiall Majestie and this kingdome to these straits&#146;, a veiled reference to Strafford  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes from the Beginning of the Long Parliament to the Opening of the Trial of the Earl of Strafford</span>, ed. W. Notestein, 1923, 247).<br>
<br>Bristol's rehabilitation was finally complete when, on 19 February 1641, he was again appointed a privy councillor, apparently in recognition of his services in the negotiations with the Scots. The following spring, despite his earlier implied criticism of Strafford, he attempted to reach a compromise whereby the earl would be deprived of his offices but his life spared. This stance incurred the wrath of the anti-Straffordian crowds outside the palace of Westminster, and on 3 May some members of the mob denounced Bristol as &#145;an apostate from the cause of Christ, and our mortall enemie&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Briefe and Perfect Relation, of the Answeres and Replies of Thomas Earle of Strafford</span>, 1647, 85). He was excused from voting on Strafford's attainder on the grounds that he had been a witness in the earl's trial. Charles clearly approved of his conduct, and when the king departed for Scotland the following August he made Bristol a gentleman of the bedchamber.<h2>
<a name="Royalism"></a>Royalism</h2>Bristol's identification with the emerging royalist party became even clearer after parliament reassembled after the autumn recess. On 17 December he was responsible for an amendment to a Commons declaration against any toleration for Catholics, to the effect that &#145;no religion shall be tolerated in His Majesty's dominions but what is or shall be established by laws of this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4.480). Like many other royalists he combined anti-Scottish sentiments with an attachment to episcopacy and the prayer book. By this time he had increasingly become a target for the more radical members of the Commons. On 27 December Walter Long named him an &#145;evill counsellor&#146; in the Commons, and the house ordered that Charles's letter of 1626 accusing Bristol of trying to lure him away from protestantism be produced  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes from the Final Recess of the Long Parliament to the Withdrawal of King Charles from London</span>, ed. W. H. Coates, 1942, 352&#150;3). The following day Oliver Cromwell moved that the Commons join with the Lords in requesting the king that Bristol &#145;bee removed from his Counsell&#146; on the grounds that he had &#145;perswaded his Majestie to putt&#146; the northern army &#145;into a posture&#146; against parliament the previous spring  (ibid., 358). There appears to be no surviving evidence either to support or to refute this statement and several other members, including Bristol's close friend Sir John Strangways, succeeded in thwarting the motion.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1642 the Lords committed Bristol to the Tower of London for his failure to disclose that he had been given a copy of the Kentish petition, which the house regarded as &#145;scandalous, dangerous and tending to sedition&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4.678). He was released on 19 April, and spoke twice in the Lords advocating an accommodation, though on 27 May he disowned the printing of a speech bearing his name. He joined the king shortly afterwards, and he became widely perceived among parliamentarians as a hardliner who wished to perpetuate the conflict, a perception that may have been fuelled by his earlier association with Spain. In October 1642 the houses exempted Bristol from a general amnesty and stopped his pension. The Oxford propositions of February 1643 demanded that he be removed from the king's counsels, and that he and Lord Herbert of Raglan be &#145;restrained from coming within the verge of the Court, and that they may not bear any office, or have any employments concerning the State or commonwealth&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, ed., <span class="italic">Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution, 1625&#150;1660</span>, 3rd edn, 1906, 264).<br>
<br>Between November 1643 and January 1644 Bristol became involved in secret talks with Thomas Ogle, a prisoner in Winchester House. The aim appears to have been to develop an anti-presbyterian coalition between royalists and Independents, and the terms that Ogle devised included a plan for a modified episcopacy that bore some resemblance to that later embodied in <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span> in 1647  (Gardiner). However, Ogle indicated that the parliamentarian garrison of Aylesbury would be betrayed as proof of the serious intentions behind the proposals, and this intelligence quickly reached the committee of safety. The &#145;plot&#146; collapsed and Ogle fled abroad early in January 1644.<br>
<br>Bristol's involvement in these secret talks appears only to have reinforced the houses' negative perception of him, and in the Uxbridge propositions (November 1644) he was listed among fifty-eight royalists who could &#145;expect no pardon&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, ed., <span class="italic">Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution, 1625&#150;1660</span>, 3rd edn, 1906, 278). This image of him was probably reinforced by the fact that his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7627/', "George Digby, Lord Digby")</script>, who was also listed among those exempted from pardon, was known to be one of the more hardline royalists. Although father and son do not appear to have been closely politically aligned during the civil war, Digby's association with Henrietta Maria and his swashbuckling military career may well have coloured views of his father. However, Bristol's reputation among those at Westminster as a hardline advocate of the prolongation of the war appears to have been misplaced. Following the Oxford propositions he withdrew from the king's court at Oxford in order to remove a cause of difference between the two sides, and he went first to his house at Sherborne and then in the spring of 1644 to Exeter, where he remained until that city capitulated to Fairfax on 13 April 1646. The following month he submitted a petition to the Lords asking to be allowed to compound for his estate by paying a composition fine, and to remain in England. The houses rejected this request, and on 11 July ordered that he receive a pass to go overseas. He left for France shortly afterwards and spent the rest of his life there. He died in Paris on 21 January 1653 and was buried in the protestant cemetery in the city. His widow lived on until 12 September 1658, and was buried at Sherborne.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>In 1647, at Caen, Bristol published <span class="italic">An Apologie of John Lord Digby Earl of Bristoll</span> in which he repudiated the &#145;many most unjust and untrue calumnies and aspersions which have been cast upon me both in print and otherwise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Apologie</span>, 5). Bristol then robustly defended his reasons for adhering to the king, insisting that he was bound to do so<blockquote>by the law of God, by the doctrine and practice of all Christian Churches, and in all times, by many oathes, by the laws of the kingdome, by my natural allegiance as a subject, and by gratitude and fidelity, as a sworn servant, both to his father and himself. (ibid., 12)</blockquote>Using both common law arguments and scriptural texts, he denied the lawfulness of resistance and argued that to take up arms against the king was contrary to all &#145;duties of religion, of oaths, of loyalty, of laws, of gratitude, and moral honesty&#146;  (ibid., 61&#150;2). This <span class="italic">Apologie</span> was reprinted in London in 1660.<br>
<br>The overall impression of Bristol's career is of a man who gave much important public service and did not always gain the rewards or recognition that he merited. He surely did not deserve the intense hostility he received from Buckingham in the 1620s, or the parliamentarians in the 1640s. Yet his own temperament may have been partly to blame for his fate. His integrity and high principles at times verged on self-righteousness and prickliness, and helped to make him something of a loner, both politically and personally. His character was well summed up by Clarendon, who wrote that<blockquote>though he was a man of great parts, and a wise man, yet he had been for the most part single, and by himself, in business, which he managed with good sufficiency, and had lived little in consort; so that in Council he was passionate and supercilious, and did not bear contradictions without much passion, and was too voluminous a discourser; so that he was not considered there with much respect. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.532)</blockquote>Sir Philip Warwick offered a similar assessment:<blockquote>Well accomplished, and of great parts natural and acquired, &hellip; but he had likewise so much of a romantick spirit, and of such superfined politics &hellip; so as these eminences made him never prosperous either to himself or his master. (P. Warwick, <span class="italic">Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles</span>, 1701, 1.279)</blockquote>
