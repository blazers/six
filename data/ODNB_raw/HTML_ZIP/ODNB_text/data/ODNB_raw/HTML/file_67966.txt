<span class="headword">Lugge,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1647<span class="mult">x</span>55?), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was baptized at Barnstaple on 24 October 1580, the second son of Thomas Lugge, a prominent citizen and shoemaker there, and his wife, Joan Downe, and not, as has often been stated, of Thomas Lugge, a vicar-choral at Exeter Cathedral from 1570. Nothing is known of his early musical education; he may have served as a cathedral chorister at Exeter, though there is no evidence for this. By 1602, when his first child was born, he had married.<br>
<br>Lugge spent his adult life in the service of Exeter Cathedral. The date of his arrival is not recorded; but he was certainly organist there during the quarter ending on 25 March 1603, when he signed in receipt of the salary for this post. On 24 June 1605 Lugge was admitted a lay vicar-choral, having enjoyed the profits of the vicar's stall of one Upcott (whom he had presumably replaced) for half of the previous quarter. Up until June 1608 Lugge received the &pound;10 annual salary attached to the joint office of organist and master of the choristers, but by Michaelmas of that year he was sharing the salary (and therefore probably also some of the duties) with Edward Gibbons. This division of salary persisted up until the mid-1640s.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1617 Lugge's brother, Peter, &#145;a Spanish sympathizer&#146;  (Shaw, 109), wrote Lugge a letter, which was intercepted by Bishop William Cotton of Exeter. Cotton duly examined John Lugge but found that he had no popish sympathies, though his religion was &#145;as the market goes&#146;  (ibid.). According to Cotton's report, dated 14 January 1618, Lugge had had nothing to do with his brother for seven years and had never promised to become a Catholic. Cotton continued: &#145;though I fear, and by conference do suspect that he hath eaten a little bit, or mumbled a piece of this forbidden fruit, yet I verily believe he hath spit it all out again&#146;  (Steele, 310). His vicar-choral colleagues certified his innocence, and a search of his house three years later turned up no evidence against him. None the less, the fact that John's youngest son, Robert (organist of St John's College, Oxford, since 1635), some time prior to April 1639 &#145;went beyond the seas and changed his religion for that of Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Lugge</span>, iv) must raise the distinct probability that John may also have harboured Catholic views.<br>
<br>Lugge apparently served Exeter Cathedral well. The dean and chapter granted to him and his family permission to live in his house in Kallendarhay (as the vicars' close was called) until their deaths and, on 18 October 1617, the profits of a vacant clerkship of the second form to supplement his income. There is also evidence that he was allowed a deputy organist, for on 21 March 1618 it was decreed that Hugh Facy, one of the lay clerks, &#145;should sometimes play on the organs at service tyme&#146;  (Payne, 234). On 12 August 1644 Lugge's wife, Rebecca, died, having borne six children between 1606 and 1622. By the summer of 1646 choral services had been abandoned: Lugge is mentioned for the last time in a vicars-choral account book for 1647, and in the same year he transferred the lease of his house to his daughter, Mary. He may have died before 1655.<br>
<br>Lugge was one of the most talented English provincial composers of the period and is remembered for his outstanding organ music, especially the three voluntaries for double organ, which is well written, imaginative, and technically demanding. He also left three short keyboard dances, and a small quantity of church music comprising three service-settings (one of which was praised by the eighteenth-century music historian Charles Burney) and four anthems.<br>
