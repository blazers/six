<span class="headword">Clyde,  James Latham McDiarmid</span>, Lord Clyde  (1898&#150;1975), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 30 October 1898 at 17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, the elder son (there was no daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32460/', "James Avon Clyde (1863&#150;1944)")</script>, later lord justice-general of Scotland, and his wife, Anna Margaret McDiarmid (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Professor Peter Wallwork Latham of Cambridge. His parents were formidable personalities. Having, as a small boy, saved his pocket money to buy his mother a scarf for her birthday, he was sharply told to take it back: he had bought it at a shop owned by supporters of the Liberal Party. Although he later followed almost every step of his father's career, he did so under constant pressure to succeed without the advantage of his father's majestic presence, intellect, or self-confidence. His stern upbringing may explain a certain insensitivity to the feelings of others less resilient than himself which he sometimes displayed on the bench, particularly in criminal appeals.<br>
<br>Clyde was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, Trinity College, Oxford, and the University of Edinburgh. He was commissioned in the Royal Garrison Artillery towards the end of the First World War. He obtained a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> at Oxford in 1921 but a pass with distinction in the LLB examination at Edinburgh in 1924. In 1928 he married Margaret Letitia (1901&#150;1974), daughter of Arthur Edmund DuBuisson, barrister; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101551/', "James John Clyde (1932&#150;2009)")</script> (the third Lord Clyde on the Scottish bench, and lord of appeal in ordinary, 1996&#150;2001), and one daughter, Margaret Ann (Lady Butler).<br>
<br>Clyde was admitted to the Scots bar in 1924 and was counsel in three <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> of the period. As junior to Craigie Aitchison he appeared for John Donald Merritt at his trial for the murder of his mother in 1927, and for Oscar Slater at his appeal in 1928. In 1932 he appeared in the House of Lords in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>. He took silk in 1936 and became one of the leaders of the bar, retained in particular by the City of Edinburgh. The uncertain life of an advocate attracted him because, as he said, he loved living on the edge of a precipice. Like most advocates in those days he took an active part in politics, and became Conservative MP for North Edinburgh (1950&#150;54). Appointed lord advocate and sworn of the privy council in 1951, he became lord justice-general and lord president in 1954. Slight of build and exceptionally agile in body and mind, he was rarely at rest. Like his father, he did not practise unreceptive judicial silence. Hitching of his gown, which was always falling off his shoulders, and faster twiddling of his pencil, meant that counsel would be wise to move on. Further argument was profitless when he started shuffling his notes for the judgment which he would, in almost every case, deliver without hesitation or correction as soon as counsel sat down.<br>
<br>Clyde was not popular with some sections of the legal profession and of the press, which suggested that his appointment to high office was due more to birth and political influence than to legal talent. But his shortcomings (of which he was engagingly aware) reflected those very traits of character which made him, in the words of <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary, a great public servant and a most lovable man. He was decisive and never wasted time on second thoughts. His deceptively simple judgments dealt only with the essential points, stated the law tersely and clearly, and rarely provoked dissent. Although (or perhaps because) his filing system consisted of used envelopes and a blunt pencil, his court administration was quick, simple, and efficient. An agenda was something to be got through, not discussed. He had a deep contempt for the bureaucratic mind and took particular delight in circumventing bureaucratic obstruction. The backlog left by his predecessor (Baron Cooper of Culross) was soon cleared and was not allowed to build up again. He sought out (he did not summon) those he wished to consult, and if persuaded would act at once. Under his guidance Parliament House was transformed from a nineteenth-century warren into a modern court house and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to explore, and share with others, its secrets and treasures.<br>
<br>Known to everyone as Hamish, Clyde was quite without side (he refused a peerage), and off the bench, and sometimes on it, he had the charm and endless curiosity of a small boy. (His appearance on the bench was nicely caught in a caricature by David Langdon.) He loved Scotland, its countryside, its history, its monuments, and its books. He was happiest in old clothes, with a pipe in his mouth and his much loved wife at his side, gardening, tending trees, reading, or playing with his model railway, at Briglands, the house at Rumbling Bridge, Kinross-shire, designed for his father by Sir Robert Lorimer. He served for twenty years as vice-chairman of the National Library of Scotland. With the chairman, David Lindsay, earl of Crawford and Balcarres, he worked tirelessly for the library at a critical period in its history. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Kinross-shire in 1964, and was awarded the honorary degree of LLD by the universities of Edinburgh (1954), St Andrews (1955), and Aberdeen (1960). Clyde died at home in Rumbling Bridge on 30 June 1975.<br>
