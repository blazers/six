<span class="headword">Pelly, Sir  Henry Bertram</span>  (1867&#150;1942), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 9 September 1867 in Upminster, Essex, the sixth of seven sons of Richard Wilson Pelly (1814&#150;1890), captain, Royal Navy, and his wife, Katherine Jane (<i>d</i>. 1901), youngest daughter of John Gurney Fry of Hale End, Essex.<br>
<br>Pelly entered the navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS <i>Britannia</i> in January 1881 and during his early career spent long periods abroad on the China station and in the south Pacific, interspersed with service in the Channel Fleet. He departed from the usual career in 1897, when he declined the offer of command of a torpedo-boat destroyer and requested appointment to a larger ship because &#145;promotion would never come to me unless I could serve under a rising man rather than as my own head&#146;  (Pelly, 57). He was eventually able to put this into practice. After service in the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i> (1899&#150;1901) and promotion to commander he was flag commander (1902&#150;4) to the successive commanders of the Channel Fleet, admirals Sir A. K. Wilson and Lord Charles Beresford. On 14 December 1904 he married Lilian Katherine Hawkshaw (1883&#150;1966), elder daughter of Sir William Vincent, twelfth baronet (1834&#150;1914), of Stoke D'Abernon, Leatherhead, Surrey. The couple had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Promoted captain on 1 January 1906, Pelly subsequently became flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman in the Mediterranean Fleet (1906&#150;7) and flag captain to Admiral Beresford in the Channel Fleet (1907&#150;9). He was inspector of contract-built ships (1909&#150;12) and, just after the outbreak of the war in 1914, was given command of the battle cruiser <i>Tiger</i>, completing at Greenock. To date Pelly had enjoyed what was in appearance a charmed career, with a succession of posts as flag commander or flag captain to &#145;rising men&#146;, followed by command of the magnificent <i>Tiger</i>, whose arrival was eagerly awaited by Rear-Admiral Beatty, commander of the battle-cruiser force. However, this supposedly choice appointment had a host of problems. The ship was still unfinished and did not commission until 3 October, and even then did not land all civilian workers for another three months. There were numerous teething troubles, particularly with electrical systems and dynamos, and precious little time&#151;only nine days according to Pelly&#151;for her new and inexperienced crew to train before joining the fleet.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1915, acting on intelligence provided by wireless interception, Beatty engaged a German raiding force in the vicinity of Dogger Bank. A running battle followed in which Beatty, in the leading ship <i>Lion</i>, signalled: &#145;Engage the corresponding ship in the enemy's line&#146;. <i>Tiger</i> was the second British ship and Beatty intended her to engage the second German ship, the <i>Moltke</i>. Pelly, however, considering that there were five British battle cruisers against three German battle cruisers and an armoured cruiser, interpreted this to mean that he should concentrate on the lead German ship, the <i>Seydlitz</i>, leaving the two rearmost British ships to concentrate on the last German ship, the armoured cruiser <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>. This resulted in <i>Moltke</i>'s being left free to fire on the leading British ships; the errors were compounded after the <i>Lion</i> was damaged and fell behind. Beatty's signal &#145;Attack the rear of the enemy&#146; was misinterpreted by the second-in-command, Rear-Admiral Sir Archibald Moore, to mean the now doomed <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i> instead of the escaping German battle cruisers. <i>Tiger</i>, though initially ahead of the other British ships, manoeuvred erratically, probably because of a shell that destroyed the intelligence office below the conning tower and damaged internal communications. Pelly chose not to continue the pursuit unsupported&#151;had he done so other British ships might have followed&#151;and the Germans escaped with the loss of <i>Bl&uuml;cher</i>. Pelly's post-battle explanation, that his conduct was based on the Grand Fleet battle orders pertaining to concentrating fire on the lead enemy ship as the best means of reducing the enemy's speed, was not accepted by Beatty, and Pelly was informed that Beatty's signals were for guidance not rigid adherence, and that the main objective had been the destruction of the enemy. Beatty made allowances for a newly commissioned ship and for the fact that Pelly's crew included a large number of recovered deserters, but he now regarded Pelly as &#145;a little bit of the nervous excited type&#146;  (Patterson, 145). Admiral J. A. Fisher, the first sea lord, was furious and referred to the captain of the <i>Tiger</i> as a &#145;poltroon&#146; who &#145;ought to have gone on had he the slightest Nelsonic temperament in him, regardless of signals&#146;  (Marder, <span class="italic">Fear God</span>, 150&#150;1). Fisher added: &#145;<i>Any fool can obey orders!</i>&#146;  (ibid.). Pelly might very well have been relieved but for the intervention of the first lord, Winston Churchill, who possibly did not want to tarnish the British victory.<br>
<br>Pelly survived for the moment but there was a cloud over his future, and when <i>Tiger</i>'s gunnery did not improve his inclusion among the &eacute;lite of the battle-cruiser squadron ended. In May 1916 Beatty reported the <i>Tiger</i>'s shooting &#145;as usual unsatisfactory&#146; and, as there was a convenient opening ashore, Pelly was named commodore, Royal Navy barracks, Portsmouth. However, before the formal change of command the battle of Jutland took place, and Pelly received the CB for his conduct of <i>Tiger</i>. Promoted rear-admiral in 1917, he remained at Portsmouth for the rest of the war. He was subsequently rear-admiral, Egypt and Red Sea station (1919&#150;20) and admiral superintendent of dockyard and senior naval officer of Gibraltar, 1920&#150;3. He was promoted vice-admiral in 1922, and in 1925 was placed on the retired list, with promotion to admiral in 1926. In 1938 he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">300,000 Sea Miles: an Autobiography</span>. He died at Churchill, near Axminster, Devon, on 27 December 1942.<br>
<br>It was not only Pelly's mistake that permitted the bulk of the German force to escape at Dogger Bank&#151;there were mistakes by others that contributed to this&#151;and one cannot definitely say that, had it not happened, he would have risen to higher office in a reduced navy after the war. Nevertheless his questionable judgement at a crucial moment undoubtedly blighted a promising career and forever diminished his reputation in naval history.<br>
