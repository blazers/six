<span class="headword">Palfreyman,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1589?), <span class="occ">author</span>, was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal under Edward VI and Elizabeth I. In Edward's reign he was paid 7&frac12;<i>d</i>. a day along with the thirty-one other members of the lay choir, who included the well-known musicians William Hunnis, Richard Farrant, and Thomas Tallis; they were joined in 1569 by Tallis's pupil, William Byrd. He seems to have lived in the parish of St Peter Cornhill in the city of London. In 1589 Palfreyman, presumably on his death, was replaced by Robert Allison. John Pankhurst, bishop of Norwich, addressed a Latin epigram to Palfreyman and Robert Couch, praising their knowledge of both music and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, as well as the piety of their lives:<blockquote>
<div>Vos non queo non dicere<br>
</div>
<div>Doctos viros, viros pios.<br>
</div>(<div>I cannot but say that<br>
</div>
<div>You are learned men, pious men.</div>)<br> (Pankhurst, 156)</blockquote>Palfreyman's most popular works were his various revisions and enlargements of William Baldwin's <span class="italic">A Treatise of Morall Phylosophie, Contaynyng the Sayinges of the Wyse</span> (1547), a collection of moral apophthegms attributed to ancient thinkers. In the first of Palfreyman's revised editions, issued <i>c</i>.1555 and dedicated to Lord Henry Hastings, he rearranged the adages in Baldwin's treatise, wrote summaries of each chapter, and added three new books to the original four, but omitted much of the material on the history of ancient philosophy &#145;that therby the treatise should seme the lesse to be enlarged, and the more handsome of the reader to be caried&#146;  (sig. A4<i>r</i>). This omission led Baldwin to complain, when reissuing his own treatise in 1556, that &#145;mayster Palfreyman &hellip; hath lefte that out, whiche many most desyer&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). A further augmented edition, still in seven books, was brought out by Palfreyman in 1557, followed in 1564 by a ten-book version, bearing both authors' names on the title-page and printing both their letters of dedication. The treatise reached its final twelve-book form in 1579, with Palfreyman not only adding several new chapters but also restoring the previously omitted ones. This version was reprinted seven times from 1584 to 1610. Five further editions, published between <i>c</i>.1620 and <i>c</i>.1640, state on the title-page: &#145;Now the sixt time inlarged by T. Palfreyman&#146;; in reality, however, they simply reprint his 1579 letter &#145;To the Reader&#146;, with the number of the edition altered, almost certainly by another hand.<br>
<br>Apparently attempting to produce a Christian counterpart to Baldwin's work, Palfreyman published <span class="italic">The Treatise of Heavenly Philosophie</span> (1578), dedicated to Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex. He drew on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Christian writings in place of pagan works, which, though &#145;not utterly to be contemned&#146;, were &#145;not altogether to be tarried upon &hellip; or in any one jot to be compared to the Scriptures&#146;  (sig. *5<i>v</i>). Unsurprisingly, perhaps, this 900-page patchwork of biblical and patristic quotations, interspersed with devout prayers and hectoring exhortations, and prefaced by lives of Moses and David, failed to capture the popular market exploited by Baldwin and was never reprinted.<br>
<br>Palfreyman's earliest work in print, <span class="italic">A Myrrour Conteinyng the True Knowledge and Love of God</span> (1560), sets out in detail the Christian duties of different estates of the realm, from lords to rich farmers and merchants. Another devotional work, <span class="italic">Divine Meditations</span> (1572), was dedicated to Isabel Harington, a gentlewoman of the queen's privy chamber. He also edited <span class="italic">A Paraphrase uppon the Epistle of &hellip; S. Paule to the Romanes</span> (1572?), an anonymous work &#145;voide of good stile&#146; and &#145;evell Englished&#146;  (sig. *3<i>r</i>), along with letters by Ulrich Zwingli, and tracts by Martin Borrhaus. These works, he explained, had been given to him by a friend during the &#145;dolefull dayes&#146; of Queen Mary's reign, &#145;fastened in their bandes&#146; in preparation for burning, &#145;although by Gods providence prevented to the contrary&#146;  (sig. *2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Palfreyman's descendants may include the three Thomases surnamed Palfreman, Palfryman, and Palfreyman, recorded in the registers of the University of Oxford for the years 1586, 1633&#150;6, and 1662&#150;5 respectively.<br>
