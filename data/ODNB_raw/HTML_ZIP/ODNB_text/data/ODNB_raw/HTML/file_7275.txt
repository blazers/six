<span class="headword">Davies,  William Edmund</span>  (1819&#150;1879), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born in London. His father was a carpenter and Davies too entered the building trade, working for Cubitt &amp; Co., contractors and builders, Gray's Inn Road, London. On one occasion he was sent to Newmarket to help repair the inside of the subscription rooms. Whether this influenced him to begin taking bets from his fellow workers is a matter for conjecture, but his success as a petty bookmaker enabled him to give up working as a carpenter. He was a major pioneer of the betting list, in which the names of horses and the odds against them would be displayed openly, often in public-house windows. His first list was at the Salisbury Arms in Durham Street, Strand, London, and his second at a house known as Barr's Windsor Castle, 27 Long Acre, Covent Garden. At these places he and his clerks stood at huge bankers' ledgers and entered the bets. By the time the <span class="roman">Betting House Act</span> of 1853 made such lists illegal, on the grounds that they tempted working people into crime to finance their gambling, Davies had become a wealthy man.<br>
<br>Davies also moved up the betting market, abandoning his &#145;silver&#146; book and setting a minimum bet of &pound;1. At the other end of the scale he appears to have set no limit and earned himself the sobriquet Leviathan for the size of the bets he accepted, both individually and in aggregate. He established himself at the head of the profession by betting with the earl of Strafford &pound;12,000 to &pound;1,000 on the Cur for the Cesarewitch in 1848; he paid the money on the day after the race. From that moment he enjoyed the chief patronage of all heavy backers of horses, and his lists ruled the market. In 1850, when Lord Zetland's Voltigeur was the winning Derby favourite, Davies had to pay out nearly &pound;40,000 over his list counter to his humbler clients who had put their sovereigns on the race. In the previous Derby, when Hotspur was beaten by the Flying Dutchman, he had lost a similar sum. The victory of Daniel O'Rourke in the 1852 Derby resulted in his having to pay more than &pound;100,000. Yet despite his losses he opened the season of 1853 with &pound;130,000 to his credit at the London and Westminster Bank. His constant habit was to go to Tattersall's after the Derby, however great his losses, and pay on the Monday instead of waiting until the conventional settling Tuesday; and while his lists were in force he returned every night from Newmarket to attend to them and provide the money for paying next day. In an era of turf corruption he was an honest man, one of a small number of bookmakers of whom Admiral Rous, doyen of the Jockey Club, said he would accept their word of a &pound;10,000 bet without a written undertaking. The certainty that claims on him would be paid on demand made his winning tickets as negotiable among his customers as banknotes.<br>
<br>A muscular, powerful man, who once fell through the dilapidated stand at Rochester, Davies opted for early retirement and wound up his business on the Friday of the Houghton meeting in 1857, and took his final leave of Newmarket. On his retirement he lived first at the King and Queen Hotel, Brighton, but soon moved to 18 Gloucester Place, Brighton, where he died on 4 October 1879. In his will he left property in railway shares valued at &pound;60,000 to the Brighton corporation, subject to the payment of certain annuities. His widow, Ann Davies, gave notice to dispute the will, but on 21 January 1880 an arrangement was made by which the greater part of the property went to the corporation on her death. Preston Park, Brighton, which cost &pound;50,000 and was opened on 8 November 1884, was purchased with this money.<br>
