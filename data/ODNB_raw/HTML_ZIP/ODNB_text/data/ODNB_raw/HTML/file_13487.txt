</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holcroft,  Thomas</span>  (1745&#150;1809), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Orange Court, Leicester Fields, London, on 10 December 1745, the son of Thomas Holcroft (<i>d</i>. 1797), a shoemaker, and his wife, Sarah, an occasional costermonger. He was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 25 December. Detailed knowledge of Holcroft's life comes mainly from his autobiography. The elder Thomas Holcroft was probably from Martin Mere near Stockport and was the son of a &#145;white cooper&#146; or maker of pails and tubs for domestic and dairy use. He kept a shoemaker's shop in Orange Court specializing in the unique boots worn by sedan-chair carriers, and later hired out horses.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>When the family encountered financial difficulties they settled in Berkshire, beyond Ascot Heath. Here Holcroft's father taught him to read; he went through eleven chapters of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> a day and read chapbooks such as <span class="italic">Parismus and Parismenes</span> and <span class="italic">The Seven Champions of Christendom</span>. Holcroft's parents then became itinerant pedlars throughout East Anglia and the midlands. Holcroft later wrote of his father, &#145;I believe few men in the kingdom had in the course of their lives been the hucksters of so many small wares; or more enterprising dealers in articles of a half-penny value&#146;  (Holcroft, 1.26). They kept a run-down house at Rugeley, Staffordshire, and attended markets and fairs. The young Holcroft was put to many tasks to augment the family income, and at times the family had to sleep rough, permanently impairing Holcroft's health. Holcroft's father was a sober man and proud of his son's intellectual superiority to other boys, but he had a short temper and often beat Thomas for minor faults.<br>
<br>For a while Holcroft was apprenticed to a stocking weaver at Nottingham, but having a passion for horses he became a stable boy at Newmarket in 1757 and worked for various grooms of noblemen horse-breeders over two and a half years. Here he lived relatively well, though he was occasionally thrown by horses and was called upon to defend himself with his fists against bullying. At Newmarket he continued his informal education, learning arithmetic and singing from occasional teachers and reading whatever he could find, including ballads and broadsheets pasted on alehouse and cottage walls. His father's friend gave him <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>; he loved the latter, and tales of the marvellous, though he disbelieved in spirits and ghosts. He also enjoyed pious books such as <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> and Horneck's <span class="italic">Crucified Jesus</span>, and he ranked Bunyan &#145;among the most divine authors I had ever read&#146;  (Holcroft, 1.93). He caught betting fever at Newmarket, and was chagrined to find that boys he thought intellectually inferior were cleverer at placing wagers. Unpopular with most of his workmates, he eventually left Newmarket to work at his father's cobbling stall in South Audley Street, London, continuing to spend any spare money on books. When he was nineteen he accompanied his father to Liverpool and taught reading at a school before returning to London and the cobbling trade.<br>
<br>In 1765 Holcroft married and had a daughter, Ann, but nothing more is known of this union, and his wife appears to have died prematurely. He had some essays published in the <span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span>, but an attempt to start a school in the country failed. He then entered the household of Granville Sharpe as part servant, part secretary, but was dismissed for persistently attending a spouting club for amateur dramatic recitation. Holcroft considered joining the East India Company army, but instead turned to the theatre; he played small parts with Samuel Foote's Haymarket Theatre in summer 1770 and then, with Charles Macklin's introduction, became a prompter and bit-part actor at William Dawson's Capel Street Theatre in Dublin. He quarrelled with Dawson and joined Henry Mossop's Smock Alley company briefly, then a company at Leeds, and then Roger Kemble's company at Hereford. After another quarrel he joined Samuel Stanton's company at Birmingham. In 1774 he married Matilda Tipler from Nottingham; in the autumn of that year the couple joined Booth's company at Carlisle, where Holcroft remained for a year and a half. A son, William, was born in 1773 and a daughter, Sophy, at Cockermouth in 1775; their mother died soon afterwards, apparently from complications of childbirth. Aiming to better himself in London, Holcroft, like many others, wrote to David Garrick, stating that he specialized in low comedy and old men, knew music well, had some French, and could fence; he enclosed a poem, &#145;Hope, or, The Delusion&#146;, but received no response. He met the composer William Shield and knew Muzio Clementi, the pianist and composer; he sang in concerts and continued to play the violin. He carried on acting in the provinces, from Edinburgh to Canterbury, and, conscious of his haphazard education, he read such books as Lowth's grammar and Pope's translation of Homer, preferring moral to descriptive and sentimental poets. Wherever he was, he cultivated men of enquiring mind and literary bent, such as the antiquary and promoter of vegetarianism Joseph Ritson at Stockton upon Tees.<h2>
<a name="Stagecareerandearlywritings"></a>Stage career and early writings</h2>Holcroft still longed for a career in London, however, and went there in 1777. Soon afterwards, on 14 June 1778, he married for the third time. With his new wife, Dinah Robinson, he had a fourth child, <a href="#cosubject_76726">Fanny [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who later became a novelist, playwright, and translator. He and his wife kept a house in Southampton Buildings and took lodgers to make ends meet. While with Booth he had written dramatic sketches, and he now sent an afterpiece, &#145;The Crisis, or, Love and Fear&#146;, to the wife of R. B. Sheridan, with a long list of the roles he played and his other theatrical skills. He landed a place in the Drury Lane company at 20<i>s</i>. a week, and began in small singing parts in January 1777. &#145;The Crisis&#146;, with music by Shield, lasted only one night, 1 May 1778, but Sheridan raised his wage. In summer 1778 Holcroft joined W. W. Dimond's company at Canterbury for the London off-season, during which he acquired many new parts and staged his comedy &#145;Rosamond, or, The Dutiful Daughter&#146;. Back at Drury Lane in the autumn, still with only minor parts, he tried any kind of writing possible to earn more money. A small volume of poems entitled <span class="italic">Elegies</span> (1777) received little attention. He completed two afterpieces, &#145;The Shepherdess of the Alps&#146; and &#145;The Maid of the Vale&#146; (a translation of Goldoni's opera <span class="italic">La buona figliuola</span>, then being performed in London). His series of essays entitled &#145;The philosopher&#146; and a serial novella, <span class="italic">Manthorn, the Enthusiast</span>, were published in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> (1777&#150;8, 1778&#150;9). He also wrote some pieces for Thomas King, manager of Sadler's Wells Theatre, and songs with music by Shield for performance at the Vauxhall pleasure gardens, some of which achieved popularity. His column entitled &#145;The actor&#146;, which dealt with theatrical issues, ran in the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span>. He fictionalized his experiences as a strolling player, including his aspirations for upward mobility, in an epistolary picaresque novel, <span class="italic">Alwyn, or, The Gentleman Comedian</span> (1780), that followed in the tradition of Le Sage, Fielding, and Smollett. Holcroft also wrote two books about the infamous Gordon riots of 1780, more as a journalist for money than out of any political leanings: <span class="italic">A Plain and Succinct Narrative</span> was described in the <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> as &#145;one of the best productions of the kind&#146; in pamphlet form  (vol. 12, July 1780, 351), and was followed the next year by Holcroft's account of Gordon's trial. Holcroft financially helped his mother and father, now living in or near Bath, and continued to do so for many years. He took minor roles at Drury Lane through the season of 1781&#150;2 and parts in provincial companies at Portsmouth, Nottingham, and elsewhere in the summers. His comedy <span class="italic">Duplicity</span>, whose plot resembles the story of Edward Moore's popular tragedy <span class="italic">The Gamester</span>, was staged at Covent Garden on 13 October 1781 and was performed six more times, but was postponed on several occasions because of a leading actor's illness.<br>
<br>Although Holcroft felt the play was not allowed an appropriate run, this modest success encouraged him. He also widened his artistic and intellectual circle with friends such as Richard Fulke Greville and William Nicholson. Still aiming to rise socially and professionally, he wrote to Lord Shelburne seeking a place in the British embassy at Paris and identifying himself as a well-wisher to the government. In 1783 he went to Paris, as a correspondent for a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, at a guinea and a half a week, a little more than he had been getting as an actor. The printer John Rivington engaged him to scout for French publications suitable for translating; some of these translations Holcroft later made himself, though the extent of his published translation has been questioned. At Paris he wrote a tragedy, &#145;Ellen, or, The Fatal Cave&#146;, and met the children's writer Arnaud Berquin, some literary aristocrats including the marquis de Dampierre, later a general in the French revolutionary army, and L. S. Mercier and Nicholas de Bonneville, who became his close friends. He had left another play, &#145;The Noble Peasant&#146; (music by Shield), with Colman, manager of the Haymarket summer season theatre, and it had a successful run of ten performances in 1784. Rivington's payments were irregular, and Holcroft returned to London, where he edited and wrote much of the <span class="italic">Wit's Magazine</span> in 1783&#150;4. He published <span class="italic">Tales of the Castle</span>, translated from the popular French writer Mme de Genlis, who produced works in the genre usually called the &#145;novel of education&#146;. Beaumarchais's <span class="italic">Le mariage de Figaro</span> was the rage in Paris, and Holcroft and Bonneville transcribed it from performances there in autumn 1784; Holcroft's adaptation as <span class="italic">Follies of a Day</span> (Covent Garden, 14 December) was performed twenty-eight times in the season and brought him &pound;600 plus sale of the copyright. It was performed during every season through the 1790s and into the next century. Another comic opera, <span class="italic">The Choleric Fathers</span> (Covent Garden, 10 November 1785), had seven performances and brought him &pound;140; <span class="italic">Seduction: a Comedy</span> (Drury Lane, 12 March 1787) had nine performances and made him &pound;250. By now critics were distinguishing Holcroft's work from others' for its somewhat more careful construction and more serious moral and social criticism. He was also making significant income from translation, receiving &pound;1200 for the works of the king of Prussia.<h2>
<a name="Turntoreformistpolitics"></a>Turn to reformist politics</h2>By now, too, Holcroft's political views had changed, and he acquired a considerable library in preparation for a &#145;history of <i>bad</i> governments&#146;  (Holcroft, 1.281), based on the career of Frederick II of Prussia and attacking the effects of war and despotism. With friends such as Shield, Nicholson, and Samson Perry, the journalist and editor, Holcroft attended clubs debating both broad philosophical questions and issues of the day. In 1786 he met William Godwin, who later termed Holcroft one of his &#145;four principal oral instructors, to whom I feel my mind indebted for improvement&#146;  (Kegan Paul, 1.17). By 1788 they were close friends, meeting almost daily. Both followed the materialist argument that society and the individual are products of the political and economic order, and they developed a philosophical anarchism that advocated the elimination of government with the aim of freeing humanity to exercise its innate benevolence and sense of justice. Godwin, Holcroft, and their friends advocated open discussion and press freedom to effect the spread of truth that would emancipate all people. As a self-conscious vanguard who believed they had, through superior talents, discipline, and study, escaped indoctrination by the prevailing and unjust order, they practised an idealized, philosophical, and classical republican moderation, abstemiousness, and public virtue, and aimed in their writings to set an example as public intellectuals, while still making a living. Holcroft's philosophical stoicism was severely tested in 1789, however. His son William committed suicide on a ship at Deal rather than face his father, from whom he had taken some money in a plan to flee to the West Indies. Though supported by Godwin's friendship, Holcroft took more than a year to recover from the loss. His wife died in 1790.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Holcroft had to support himself, and the theatre was his mainstay. A play entitled <span class="italic">The German Hotel</span> (adapted from Johann Christian Brandes's <span class="italic">Trau, Schau, Wem!</span>; Covent Garden, 11 November 1790; eleven performances) is usually ascribed to him but was probably by James Marshall  (Hogan). In the early 1790s Holcroft did have further theatrical successes. <span class="italic">The School for Arrogance</span> (based on P. N. Destouches's <span class="italic">Le glorieux</span>; Covent Garden, 4 February 1791; nine performances) was restaged into the late 1790s. <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> (Covent Garden, 18 February 1792; thirty-seven performances) was his major hit; it made him &pound;900 from performances plus several hundred from publication, and ran every season into the next century. These plays advanced reformist social criticism in the comic and genially satirical form that was fairly common at the time. One result was an account of Holcroft in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, representing him as &#145;an instance of the great effects of persevering fortitude&#146; who had by his own efforts &#145;rendered himself one among the first of writers in a nation abounding with men whose talents have been cultivated under every advantage&#146;  (vol. 22, December 1792, 405).<h2>
<a name="SympathizerwiththeFrenchRevolution"></a>Sympathizer with the French Revolution</h2>Holcroft and his friends, with many others like them throughout Britain and Europe, were electrified by the French Revolution, which in its early stages effected many of the reforms they advocated, and which seemed but the beginning of a process that would bring about an earthly paradise where even disease and death would be eradicated. The French Revolution debate was conducted largely through the press, especially after publication in November 1790 of Edmund Burke's anti-revolutionary <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span>. Many replies were rushed into print, and Holcroft joined the committee to publish part 1 of Tom Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span> early in 1791, when it became clear that most publishers were unwilling to risk it. By autumn 1791 Holcroft was working on his own intervention in the revolution debate, which, characteristically, addressed a wider readership than polemical disputations or philosophical treatises. Holcroft understood that dramatic writing had to be highly conventionalized to suit the repertory theatre company system and the expectations of audiences drawn from all social classes and interests. The novel, though widely disparaged at the time as inartistic, commercialized, and intellectually and morally corrupting, would enable him to reach a large reading public while expressing more radical social criticism than drama could accommodate. As he later put it in his review of Robert Bage's <span class="italic">Man as he is</span>:<blockquote>When we consider the influence that novels have over the manners, sentiments, and passions, of the rising generation,&#151;instead of holding them in the contempt which, as reviewers, we are without exception said to do,&#151;we may esteem them, on the contrary, as forming a very essential branch of literature. (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 10, March 1793, 297)</blockquote>Holcroft's <span class="italic">Anna St Ives</span> (7 vols., 1792) revises the plot and characters of Richardson's <span class="italic">Clarissa</span> and <span class="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</span> for the French Revolution debate. In epistolary form, it also contains numerous extended dialogues expounding republican and pro-revolutionary views, but, as in the romantic comedy that was Holcroft's literary mainstay, the plot enacts reform rather than overthrow of the social order, through replacement of the weak and vicious by the virtuous and public-spirited. The work was well received, and was enjoyed as a lively novel despite the fact that its utopian politics were treated with scepticism or ridicule in some reviews. Holcroft was also engaging directly in political organization. The success of the French revolutionary government in defeating the armies of the European monarchist forces in September 1792 inspired new sympathy for the revolution in Britain, especially among artisans and middle-class people. In October Holcroft began attending meetings of the predominantly middle-class Society for Constitutional Information, which aimed to create an informed and politically conscious public, largely through public discussion and print. In November he joined the society, but he remained on its more cautious wing. According to Elbridge Colby, editor of Holcroft's memoirs, in two years Holcroft missed only half a dozen of the society's fortnightly meetings and belonged to the joint committee of correspondence and co-operation formed with similar groups, but, &#145;fearful that partisan sentiment might hurt his literary and dramatic reputation&#146;, he avoided a conspicuous role  (Holcroft, 2.27n.). At meetings he spoke seldom, counselled caution, and felt that decisions should be made by reasoning rather than majority vote.<h2>
<a name="Trialfortreasonandpublicnotoriety"></a>Trial for treason and public notoriety</h2>In 1793 Godwin published his <span class="italic">Political Justice</span>, enunciating positions worked out with Holcroft and other friends, and the work caused a sensation, partly because of its comprehensiveness, partly because it transformed the particulars of the French Revolution debate into abstract and general arguments, and partly because of its detached yet energetic style. Holcroft, too, preferred to respond to the debate with general principles and dispassionate argument. Others opted in favour of practical action and counteraction. After the &#145;British convention&#146; of reformists held in 1793 at Edinburgh and modelled on the French revolutionary conventions of the early 1790s, the government reacted by successfully trying several participants, whom Godwin and Holcroft knew, for treason in the Scottish court. Such so-called English Jacobins as Godwin, Holcroft, and their friends expected a similar move in England. Holcroft continued to write, working on another novel and staging two dramatic pieces, <span class="italic">Love's Frailties, or, Precept Against Practice</span> (based on O. H. Gemmingen's <span class="italic">Der deutsche Hausvater</span>; Covent Garden, 5 February 1794) and a prelude, <span class="italic">The Rival Queens, or, Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden</span> (based on Fielding's <span class="italic">Covent Garden Tragedy</span>; Covent Garden, 15 September 1794). In <span class="italic">Love's Frailties</span> the hero, Charles Seymour, attacks fashionable society, insincerity, corruption, social snobbery, and other social vices. Lady Fancourt, as her name indicates, follows fashion, but is converted to the cause of virtue by the example of the direct and sincere Paulina. According to the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (vol. 13, April 1794, 449), the play's liberal reviews evoked a politically motivated campaign to disrupt performance and the work was withdrawn after six representations. <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> was performed only once. Loyalist organizations were energetically harassing prominent reformists, and the government suspended habeas corpus and banned seditious meetings and publications in May 1794. When a carefully selected group, including Holcroft, the artisan Thomas Hardy, and the scholar John Horne Tooke, was indicted for treason, Holcroft's friends and his father urged him to flee the country, but he had already decided to face the situation directly. He turned himself in and was confined in Newgate. He was mocked in the loyalist press, but friends such as Godwin, Elizabeth Inchbald, and the publisher Robinson visited him in gaol. The prominent lawyer Thomas Erskine defended Holcroft without fee. At the trial Horne Tooke made the government's charges seem ridiculous, and he and Hardy were acquitted. The prosecution then abandoned the case against the others, including Holcroft, and they were released, to widespread public rejoicing. Deprived of his say in court, and smeared after release as an &#145;acquitted felon&#146;  (Holcroft, 2.78), Holcroft vindicated himself and impugned government and loyalist persecution in <span class="italic">A Narrative of Facts, Relating to a Prosecution for High Treason</span> (1795), in which he included letters to various participants in the trial and the defence he would have read to the jury. He addressed the heightened level of political confrontation in <span class="italic">A Letter to the Right Honourable William Windham</span> (1795), deploring the intemperate rhetoric and conduct of the government and its supporters.<br>
<br>Holcroft's courage in facing arrest and trial and the high-minded tone and public-spirited arguments of his two pamphlets made him a model for reform-minded intellectuals such as Robert Lovell, Thomas Dermody, and the New York Theatre manager William Dunlap, and he became an adviser to Godwin's ward Thomas Cooper. When the young Tom Wedgwood planned an academy to educate a vanguard for social change, he envisaged Holcroft among the presiding committee. Others shunned Holcroft because of his political associations. He published the first part of a picaresque novel of education, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Hugh Trevor</span> (3 vols., 1794; second part, 3 vols., 1797), which recounts the vicissitudes of a well-meaning young man in the face of systemic social corruption and in pursuit of a profession that will permit him to retain his moral integrity and ethical values.<br>
<br>Holcroft devoted time to his family; his daughter Sophy had married a Mr Cole, and in 1796 his eldest daughter, Ann, married Colonel Harwood, who too was a member of the Society for Constitutional Information. Holcroft continued to support his father, providing &pound;20 a year, and visiting him occasionally, until his death in 1797. He enjoyed riding, and belonged to a musical club that included Shield, Clementi, Crompton, and Villeneux, but withdrew when membership proved too expensive. He collected books, including a number in languages he could not read, and some pornography. He bought rare musical instruments, invested in a device for copying handwriting, and speculated in buying and selling paintings; these endeavours lost money. His health was impaired, too; he suffered some kind of stroke in 1792, apparently from overwork, and fell from a tree in 1794 during a visit to his daughter Sophy. He may have sought another partner about this time; after Mary Wollstonecraft returned from France and Scandinavia and was abandoned by Gilbert Imlay she received in January 1796 an impassioned proposal that may have come from Holcroft. While contributing regularly to the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> from 1792 to 1796, Holcroft continued to turn out plays, though with little success. <span class="italic">The Deserted Daughter</span> (Covent Garden, 2 May 1795), based on Richard Cumberland's <span class="italic">The Fashionable Lover</span>, had twelve performances and was restaged into the late 1790s. Then there was a series of flops, including <span class="italic">The Man of Ten Thousand</span> (Drury Lane, 23 January 1796, seven performances); <span class="italic">Duplicity</span> restaged as <span class="italic">The Mask'd Friend</span> (Covent Garden, 6 May 1796, one performance; 1 June 1797, two performances); <span class="italic">The Force of Ridicule</span> (Drury Lane, 6 December 1796, one performance); and <span class="italic">Knave or not</span> (based on Goldoni's <span class="italic">La serva amorosa</span> and <span class="italic">Il padre di famiglia</span>; Drury Lane, 25 January 1798, six performances). In the preface to the published version of <span class="italic">Knave or not</span> Holcroft attributed these failures to political persecution, and in August 1798 a satirical engraving in the magazine <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin</span> included Holcroft in a crowd of so-called &#145;English Jacobins&#146;. Only <span class="italic">He's much to Blame</span> (adapted from Pont-de-Veyle's <span class="italic">Le complaisant</span> and Goethe's <span class="italic">Clavigo</span>; Covent Garden, 13 February 1798), with twenty-one performances, interrupted the series of failures. These continued with <span class="italic">The Inquisitor</span> (from Unzer's <span class="italic">Diego und Leonore</span>; Haymarket, 23 June 1798, three performances) and <span class="italic">The Old Cloathsman</span>, an afterpiece with music by Thomas Attwood (Covent Garden, 2 April 1799, two performances).<br>
<br>Holcroft nevertheless maintained an active social life with intellectual and artistic friends and fellow reformists such as George Dyer and Benjamin Flower. Every second Sunday he dined with Godwin and other friends. He married as his fourth wife Louisa, daughter of his friend L. S. Mercier, on 4 March 1799 but, facing insolvency, had already planned moving to the continent to live more cheaply, to pursue translating work, to deal in paintings, to familiarize his daughters with foreign languages, and to absent himself from England &#145;till certain prejudices in the public mind, respecting me, should subside&#146;  (Holcroft, 2.222). As he wrote to the commissioners for the <span class="roman">Income Bill</span>:<blockquote>My income has always been the produce of my labour; and that produce has been so reduced, by the animosity of party spirit, that I find myself obliged to sell my effects for the payment of my debts, that I may leave the kingdom till party spirit shall subside. (ibid., 2.248)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>The Holcrofts left England in May 1799 and settled in Hamburg for a year with the Coles, who were in trade there. Holcroft wrote some &#145;Letters concerning emigration&#146; addressed to the public, but they remained unpublished. He met literary figures such as Klopstock, Voss, Sander, and Stolberg and set up a periodical, the <span class="italic">European Repository</span>, but it soon failed, and he lost money through dealing in paintings. He then lived in Paris for two years and there visited the likes of the Mountcashells and Mme de Sta&euml;l, arranging for a friend to translate her recent novel. When <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 26 January 1802 reported that he was employed by the French secret service, some of the Holcrofts' acquaintance dropped them. They returned to England in October 1802. The experiment of living abroad was a qualified success, and Holcroft's literary career and income revived. He enjoyed a run of success with <span class="italic">Deaf and Dumb</span> (Drury Lane, 24 February 1801, nine performances) and <span class="italic">A Tale of Mystery</span> (1802), which Thomas Dibdin claimed was &#145;the first entertainment acted on the English stage under the description of melo-drama&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1827, 336&#150;7). Holcroft made &pound;1500 from the copyright of <span class="italic">Travels from Hamburg, through Westphalia, Holland, and the Netherlands, to Paris</span> (2 vols., 1804). It belongs to a form of philosophical travel writing begun by Dr John Moore, Helen Maria Williams, and others, and it capitalizes on the British public's fascination with the political and social condition of the European states amid the prolonged Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. <span class="italic">Travels</span> is an essay in social, cultural, and political analysis of the revolutionized European countries, and especially of France and Paris, after more than a decade of internal and international struggle, and insists that, despite a long catalogue of errors and crimes in the name of progress, application of education and reason would effect gradual enlightenment, resolve present conflicts, and ameliorate the human condition. Still trying to establish himself through business, Holcroft, with Mercier, set up a printing house, but it failed. In the theatre he had two more successes with the comedy <span class="italic">Hear both Sides</span> (1803) and the melodrama <span class="italic">The Lady of the Rock</span> (1805). He published another novel, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Bryan Perdue</span> (3 vols., 1805), picaresque in form and partly following Sterne's reflexive style. With its plebeian anti-hero, scenes of low life, and comprehensive range of social criticism and satire it sustains the impulse of the political novel of the 1790s and foreshadows the later &#145;Newgate novel&#146; and the fiction of Dickens. <span class="italic">Tales in Verse</span> (1806) attempted to cash in on the emerging vogue for narrative poetry. Neither novel nor poems did anything for Holcroft, and the failure of his play <span class="italic">The Vindictive Man</span> (Drury Lane, 20 November 1806, two performances) left him and his family in straitened circumstances, according to Charles Lamb (letter to T. Manning, 5 Dec 1806, <span class="italic">Letters of Charles Lamb</span>). He continued working on a number of plays and other works, but he suffered increasingly from asthma and his health began to deteriorate.<br>
<br>Holcroft began dictating his autobiography, intended:<blockquote>to excite an ardent emulation in the breasts of the youthful readers; by shewing them how difficulties may be endured, how they may be overcome, and how they may at last contribute, as a school of instruction, to bring forth hidden talent. (Holcroft, 1.38)</blockquote>He had a reconciliation with Godwin, from whom he had been estranged since his return to England in 1802. Thomas Holcroft died on 23 March 1809 and was buried in Marylebone greater cemetery. He was survived by his fourth wife.<br>
<br>The Romantic liberal William Hazlitt completed what Holcroft had begun and, using Holcroft's letters, diaries, and other papers, published <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft</span> in 1816. This helped found the nineteenth-century genre of working-class autobiography. Republished and annotated several times until 1925, it established Holcroft in liberal literary and political culture as an &#145;author sprung from the people&#146;  (Mitford, vol. 1, chap. 7), exemplifying the liberal ideology of the sovereign subject and public-spirited citizen. As H. N. Brailsford wrote in 1915, &#145;The true monument to such a man is not his Opera Omnia, but his biography&#146;  (quoted in Holcroft, 1.xvi). Apart from the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, Holcroft's &#145;opera omnia&#146; were forgotten. The renewed interest, from the 1960s on, in social history, especially of the lower classes, brought new attention to the political and cultural context of Holcroft and his works, including particularly his novels and also some of his comedies and melodramas.<br>

<a name="cosubject_76726"></a><span class="headword">Fanny Margaretta Holcroft</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1785, <em>d.</em> 1844)<span class="occ"></span> followed her father in making a career in writing. She was the daughter of Holcroft's third wife, Dinah, and was baptized on 11 June 1785 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London. Fanny Holcroft seems to have been very devoted to her father, and to have received a broad and liberal education in modern languages and the arts; she shared her father's liberal political opinions and assisted him in his literary work. In 1802, on the recommendation of William Godwin, she was engaged by Lady Mountcashell as governess for her daughters&#151;a post previously held by Mary Wollstonecraft&#151;but she was quickly dismissed when <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported that Thomas Holcroft was a French spy. Fanny Holcroft provided the incidental music for her father's successful melodrama <span class="italic">The Lady of the Rock</span> (1805). She also provided translations of politically liberal plays by Alfieri, Weisse, Lessing, Calder&oacute;n, and Moratin for her father's periodical the <span class="italic">Theatrical Recorder</span> (1805&#150;6). She published <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of the Great Cond&eacute;</span> (1807), a translation of a biography of the French prince and military leader during the seventeenth-century French civil wars. After her father's death Fanny Holcroft published two novels, <span class="italic">The Wife and the Lover: a Novel</span> (3 vols., 1813) and <span class="italic">Fortitude and Frailty: a Novel</span> (4 vols., 1817), dedicated to her father's memory. These adapt his reformist politics to the post-Napoleonic era of emergent liberalism with stories of vicissitudes in private life, recommending personal virtue and social conciliation.<br>
