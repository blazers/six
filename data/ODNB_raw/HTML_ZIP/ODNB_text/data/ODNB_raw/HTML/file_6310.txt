<span class="headword">Cordiner,  Charles</span>  (1746?&#150;1794), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal clergyman and antiquary</span>, lived most of his life in Banff, and became minister of St Andrew's Chapel there in 1769. Few other biographical details concerning him survive. He died at Banff on 18 November 1794, leaving a widow and eight children. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6311/', "James Cordiner (1775&#150;1836)")</script>, the educator and author of <span class="italic">A Description of Ceylon</span> (1807), was his third son.<br>
<br>Cordiner's significance centres on two publications: <span class="italic">Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland, in a Series of Letters to Thomas Pennant</span> (1780) and <span class="italic">Remarkable ruins and romantic prospects of north Britain, with ancient monuments and singular subjects of natural history</span> (2 vols., 1788&#150;95). Both works, relying on visual and verbal description, were early contributions to the construction of a romantic image of the Scottish highlands; and both were conceived as supplements to Thomas Pennant's very successful Scottish tours of 1769 and 1772. Pennant claimed to be responsible for Cordiner's work, noting:<blockquote>When I had published the last volume of my tours in Scotland, I reflected that there were certain parts which I had not been able to visit. I prevailed on Mr. Cordiner to undertake the tour which appeared in 1780 &hellip; He afterwards published, and continues to publish, in numbers, the most remarkable ruins, and subjects of natural history he met with in his journies [<i>sic</i>] through the northern parts of his country. (<span class="italic">General Collection</span>, ed. Pinkerton, 3.66&#150;7)</blockquote>Cordiner's earlier work follows the narrative pattern of the tour used by Pennant, but the later work&#151;published in parts, one every three months, each containing two plates of landscape, one of antiquities, and one of marine animals&#151;is a miscellany of illustrations with commentary. His choice of subjects appears to derive from a circular Pennant distributed to Scottish clergymen prior to his 1772 tour indicating topics on which he sought information. The drawings in both books were Cordiner's own work, and the engraver working with him was Peter Mazell, who also did the engravings for Pennant's tours.<br>
