<span class="headword">Pain fitz John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1137), <span class="occ">baron and administrator</span>, was perhaps the eldest son of John, nephew of Waleram, also known as John fitz Richard, and the grandson of a moneyer who held a mill in the Avranchin. He shared two characteristics with several other of the &#145;new men&#146; who served Henry I: a link with western Normandy and the status of an inferior tenant-in-chief&#151;in 1086 his father held only a few estates in Norfolk and Essex. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9614/', "Eustace fitz John (d. 1157)")</script> was drawn by marriage to northern England; for the same reason Pain was attracted to the west midlands.<br>
<br>The sources are not precise about dates and offices in Pain's career. He was too young to serve William Rufus, but according to a story retailed by Walter Map, he was (perhaps briefly) a royal <i>cubicularius</i>, or chamberlain, to Henry I; but no attestations survive styling him thus, and the story suggests that Pain's duty was body service for the king (in this case the nocturnal supply of wine), rather than any concern with the royal finances. Gerald of Wales, another late source, describes Pain fitz John and his colleague Miles of Gloucester as <i>secretarii et praecipui consiliari</i>  (<span class="italic">Gir. Camb. opera</span>, 6.34), a phrase helpfully glossed as &#145;personal confidants&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Shropshire</span>, 3.11). Such services notwithstanding, when Pain was allowed, about 1115, to marry Sybil Talbot, niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15852/', "Hugh (I) de Lacy")</script>, his personal ambitions turned firmly to the southern Welsh march, though he continued to attest royal <i>acta</i> quite frequently, if seldom in Normandy. Pain's interest in the marches is evidenced by a mandate from Pope Calixtus II of as early as 1119, ordering Pain and others to return to the churches of the diocese of Llandaff all lands and other rights which they had &#145;wickedly withdrawn and retained&#146;  (Davies, 2.616). Between 1123 and 1127 he became sheriff of Herefordshire, and in the latter year he was also made sheriff of Shropshire, succeeding Richard de Belmeis as the king's vicegerent. In both shires Pain was almost certainly justice as well as sheriff, and in the pipe roll for 1130 he appears as an itinerant justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> couples Pain with Miles of Gloucester, attributing to Miles the lordship (<i>dominatum</i>) of Gloucestershire and to Pain that of Herefordshire and Shropshire, and asserting that between the Severn and the sea (that is, the Bristol Channel) they ran a highly acquisitive regime by means of litigation and forced services (<i>placitis &hellip; et angariis</i>). This may have meant that Pain dealt with the Welsh (his external problem) by impressing men to serve against them. According to the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>, Pain and Miles were among those who at the beginning of Stephen's reign sought safe conducts when summoned to court, as a precaution against the compulsory surrender of ill-gotten gains. An order of Pope Honorius II in 1128 shows that Pain had continued depredations against the church, in which Miles had joined him. However, at about this time the two men jointly lobbied Henry I to appoint the prior of Llanthony to the vacant see of Hereford.<br>
<br>There are indications that under Pain the centre of royal power in Shropshire, perhaps even in the marches as a whole, might have moved from Shrewsbury to Bridgnorth. Not only does a writ of the 1120s by Belmeis to the barons of Shropshire show that Pain held his first plea at Bridgnorth with Walter the constable, the father and in this context the forerunner of Miles of Gloucester, but in 1128, soon after Pain had succeeded Belmeis, Mareddud ap Bleddyn, the ruler of Powys, characteristically handed his nephew Llywelyn ab Owain over to Pain, who imprisoned him in Bridgnorth Castle; the king had already confined a noble Norman rebel there in 1126.<br>
<br>For some years Pain devoted much effort to consolidating his position in and around Ludlow by improving its financial and military resources. Apart perhaps from William fitz Osbern he was the first to see the strategic potential of Ludlow, half-way between Shrewsbury and Hereford and a nodal point for routes into Powys, the Welsh province whose southern portions contained Elfael (part of the Tosny lands, of which Pain had custody) and Ismynydd, which took Pain's name to become Painscastle (just as a former Lacy estate in Gloucestershire became Painswick).<br>
<br>According to William of Malmesbury, in 1128 Henry I granted the <i>comitatus Salopesberie</i> to Queen Adeliza, perhaps implying a wish to exercise more control over Pain's activities. The latter included conflict with the Welsh, who triumphed at least once; late in Henry I's reign, according to Orderic, they attacked and burnt Caus Castle, west of Shrewsbury, and slew the garrison. Orderic states that the castle was Pain's, but he was probably only its custodian.<br>
<br>Following King Henry's death Pain was present at his funeral: he declared early for Stephen and witnessed the royal charter of concessions given at Oxford in April 1136. But the Welsh&#151;perhaps those who had moved on Caus&#151;drew him back to the border and to his death. On 10 July 1137 he was killed in an ambush while pursuing a raiding party: a missile split his head open and he was buried in Gloucester Abbey. Pain left no son but he had two daughters, Cecily and Agnes, who between them had five husbands. Cecily was married first (in 1137) to Roger, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10820/', "Miles of Gloucester")</script>, but Pain's acquisitions did not descend as an entity. In Shropshire his role as a border administrator and guardian was assumed by the Fitzalans and then the Lestranges.<br>
