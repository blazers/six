<span class="headword">Alcock <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cumberland]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1741?&#150;1798), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the youngest of four children of Bishop Denison Cumberland (1705/6&#150;1774) and Joanna Bentley (1704/5&#150;1775), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2169/', "Dr Richard Bentley")</script>, classical scholar and master of Trinity College, Cambridge. The third of three daughters, and the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6888/', "Richard Cumberland (1732&#150;1811)")</script>, playwright and novelist, she was raised with her family at her father's rural rectory in Stanwick, near Higham Ferrars, Northamptonshire, until 1757, and thereafter in Fulham. In 1761 Denison Cumberland was appointed chaplain to Lord Halifax, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and her brother was made Ulster secretary. In 1763 her father was appointed by Halifax to the Church of Ireland see of Clonfert, Galway, where he was joined by his wife and Mary, and in 1772 translated to the more comfortable bishopric of Kilmore. About 1770 Mary Cumberland married, in Ireland, a man described by her brother as &#145;Mr Alcock, a young gentleman of good family, fortune and preferment&#146;, who quickly gave signs of being in precarious mental health, &#145;arising from a violent nervous affection on his spirits&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 68). At her death, she was described as the widow of Archdeacon Alcock, but her husband's identity has not been traced (he was not, as is sometimes reported, John Alcock, archdeacon of Raphoe, <i>c</i>.1733&#150;1817). The marriage was probably unhappy: Richard Cumberland wrote to Garrick on 2 October 1771 that he had &#145;at length closed the uneasy transaction of my Sister's marriage, much to my satisfaction and to that of my family&#146;  (ibid., 84). During the period of her father's Irish residence, Mary Alcock also spent extended periods with her parents at her brother's house at Tyringham, on the banks of the River Ouse, near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. Alcock nursed her parents through long illness in Clonfert and later in Kilmore, until her father died in 1774 and mother soon after in 1775. After the bishop's death, Richard Cumberland lobbied for the recovery, for his sister's use, of arrears and money spent on improvements beneficial to the new bishop.<br>
<br>Evidence in her later poetry suggests Mary Alcock was resident in Bath from at least May 1783. There she announced to her relatives that she had &#145;turn'd out a poet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 146), through her participation in the celebrated literary salon of Lady Anne Miller (1741&#150;1781) at her villa in Batheaston, 2 miles outside Bath. The poetical compositions of Miller's friends were deposited anonymously in a large Roman vase, to be read out in front of the assembled company. Perhaps through this encouragement, Alcock permitted the anonymous publication in 1784 of a seven-page poem, <span class="italic">The Air Balloon, or, Flying Mortal</span>, which reflected the public enthusiasm for ballooning in England initiated by Lunardi's ascent from Moorfields, London, on 15 September 1784. Little is known of her later life, although it is apparent that Alcock engaged herself in charitable and benevolent schemes, and cared for the seven dependent orphans of her sister Elizabeth Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1770). Among her good works was a poem, &#145;The Confined Debtor: a Fragment from a Prison&#146;, written for the relief of the debtors confined in the county gaol at Ilchester, Somerset. Through the proceeds of the poem, which describes the miseries of the prison, &#145;many debtors were liberated out of their confinement at Ilchester, and fourteen out of Newgate&#146;. As noted by her niece Joanna Hughes, Mary Alcock was a physically frail woman with &#145;a corporeal frame &hellip; extremely feeble and defenceless&#146;, and visited by &#145;afflictions&#146; of &#145;a very peculiar nature&#146;  (Hughes, iv&#150;vi). Mary Alcock died on 28 May 1798, in her fifty-seventh year, at the home of her cousin, George Ashby, at Haselbeach Hall, Northamptonshire (6 miles south of Market Harborough), having fallen ill while on a journey from Yorkshire to Bath. She was buried in the parish church of that village. Her brother Richard Cumberland remembered her as &#145;the best and most benevolent of human beings&#146;  (Cumberland, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 191).<br>
<br>Mary Alcock's works were collected after her death and published as <span class="italic">Poems &hellip; by the Late Mrs Mary Alcock</span> in 1799. The volume was edited by her niece Joanna Hughes, whose preface records most of the available biographical information. The 183-page book comprised her extant poetry, published and unpublished, together with some pious essays on marital conduct, and a short series of Scriblerian-inspired satirical essays criticizing the debased taste of novel readers. Her niece relates that:<blockquote>She never held herself up as a writer: when she resorted to her pen it was either to amuse a leisure hour, to gratify an absent friend, or for the sublimer purpose of pouring out her heart in praises and thanksgivings to her God. (Hughes, iii)</blockquote>The poems are not without merit, assaying sentimental piety and gentle satire in a variety of metrical forms, and on occasion treat serious political issues (such as civil discord in Ireland or the debate on the suspension of habeas corpus in the House of Lords). The volume met with no critical notice, but attracted 652 subscribers, among them royalty and many literary and artistic figures, including Charles Burney, Elizabeth Carter, William Cowper, Thomas Day, George Foote, Hannah More, George Romney, Samuel Rogers, and William Stockdale.<br>
