<span class="headword">Harty,  (Fredric) Russell</span>  (1934&#150;1988), <span class="occ">television broadcaster</span>, was born on 5 September 1934 in Blackburn, Lancashire, the only son and elder child of Fred Harty, greengrocer (who, his son claimed, introduced Blackburn to the avocado pear), and his wife, Myrtle Rishton. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Blackburn, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he read English and was taught by Nevill Coghill, who noted of an early essay, &#145;Sex in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>&#146;, &#145;Energetic and zealous but very na&iuml;ve&#146;. He took a third-class degree (1957) and taught briefly at Blakey Moor secondary modern school in Blackburn before moving in 1958 to Giggleswick School in Yorkshire. Giggleswick was a school and a village with which he was to have close connections for the rest of his life. In 1964 there followed a spell at City College, New York, and at Bishop Lonsdale College of Education, Derby, but with many of his friends and contemporaries busy in the theatre and broadcasting he was increasingly dissatisfied with teaching.<br>
<br>In 1966 Harty made his first foray into television, an inglorious appearance as a contestant on Granada TV's <span class="italic">Criss Cross Quiz</span>; the only question he answered correctly was on Catherine of Braganza. It was such a public humiliation that his mother refused to speak to him. Still, it was a beginning and in 1967 he was taken on by BBC radio as an arts programmes producer, his hankering to perform whetted by the occasional trip to the studio down the corridor whenever <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span> wanted a letter read in a northern accent.<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Harty had invited Vivien Leigh round for drinks and this precocious appetite for celebrity stood him in good stead when, in 1969, he became producer and occasional presenter of London Weekend TV's arts programme, <span class="italic">Aquarius</span>. He might not have seemed the best person to film Salvador Dal&iacute;, but the elderly surrealist and the boy off Blackburn market took to one another and the programme won an Emmy award; in another unlikely conjunction he set up an encounter on Capri between the eminent Lancashire exiles Sir William Walton and Gracie Fields. Harty was never abashed by the famous (his critics said that was the trouble), but it was his capacity for provocative half-truths and outrageous overstatement, which made him such a good schoolmaster, that now fitted him for a career as the host of a weekly talk show (<span class="italic">Eleven Plus</span> and later <span class="italic">Russell Harty</span>) and made him one of the most popular performers on television. Plump, cheerful, and unintimidating, he was particularly good at putting people at their ease, deflating the pompous, and drawing out the shy.<br>
<br>In 1980 Harty returned to the BBC, but his output remained much as it had been for the last ten years, the same mixture of talk shows varied by occasional films like <span class="italic">The Black Madonna</span>, and his <span class="italic">Grand Tour</span>, shown in 1988. He wrote regularly for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, publishing a book of his television interviews, <span class="italic">Russell Harty Plus</span> (1976) and also <span class="italic">Mr Harty's Grand Tour</span> (1988). He was a regular broadcaster on radio besides presenting the Radio 4 talk show <span class="italic">Start the Week</span>.<br>
<br>&#145;Private faces in public places are wiser and nicer than public faces in private places&#146;  (W. H. Auden) did not anticipate television, where the distinction is not always plain. For his friends Harty was naturally a private face but for the public he seemed a private face too and one that had strayed on to the screen seemingly untouched by expertise. That was why, though it infuriated his critics, so many viewers liked him and took him to their hearts as they never did more polished performers. He giggled, he fumbled, and seldom went for the right word rather than the next but two, and though his delivery could be as tortured as his mother's on the telephone, it did not matter. It was all part of his ordinariness, his deficiencies, his style.<br>
<br>Harty never made much of a secret of his homosexuality. He did not look on it as an affliction, but he was never one for a crusade either. His funniest stories were always of the absurdities of sex and the ludicrous situations it had led him into, and if he was never short of partners, it was because they knew there would always be laughs, sharing a joke being something rarer than sharing a bed.<br>
<br>In the second half of the 1980s the spread of AIDS enabled the tabloid press, and in particular those newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch, to dress up their muckraking as a moral crusade, and they systematically trawled public life for sexual indiscretion. Harty, who had not scrupled to question his more celebrated interviewees about their sex lives, knew that he was in a vulnerable situation. Early in 1987 a young man who had had a previous fling with Harty was wired up with a tape recorder by two <span class="italic">News of the World</span> reporters and sent to call on Harty at his London flat. To the reporters' chagrin nothing newsworthy occurred, but the paper fell back on printing the young man's account of the previous association, thus initiating a campaign of sporadic vilification in the tabloid press which ended only with Harty's death just over a year later.<br>
<br>The cause of Harty's death was liver failure, the result of hepatitis B, but in the hope that he was suffering from AIDS the press laid siege firstly to his home at Rose Cottage, Giggleswick, and then to St James's Hospital in Leeds, where he was in intensive care. A telescope was trained permanently on the window of his ward and a reporter tried to smuggle himself into the ward disguised as a junior doctor, in order to look at his case notes. When Harty was actually on his deathbed one of the journalists responsible for the original &#145;scoop&#146; could not be restrained from retelling the tale of her exploits on television. Harty died in Leeds on 8 June 1988 and was buried in Giggleswick, the gravestone evidence of the vulgarity from which he never entirely managed to break free.<br>
