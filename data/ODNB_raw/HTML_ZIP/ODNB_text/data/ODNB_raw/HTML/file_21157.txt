<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Palgrave <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Cohen]</span>, Sir  Francis</span>  (1788&#150;1861), <span class="occ">archivist and historian</span>, was born in July 1788 at Green Street, Kentish Town, London, the only son of Meyer Cohen (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1831), a stockbroker, and his wife, Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levien (<i>d</i>. 1815). In 1797 Meyer Cohen published a volume of his son's verses, an innocent gesture which ultimately became a source of painful embarrassment. Francis changed his religion and his surname upon his marriage in 1823, an act that his detractors treasured zestfully far beyond his death.<br>
<br>Francis Cohen was educated at home, where he mastered modern languages as well as Latin and Greek, but he was constrained to make his own way when his father lost his fortune on the resumption of war in 1802. He was then articled with a firm of solicitors, Loggen and Smith, of Basinghall Street. From 1808 he was their managing clerk, but by 1822, when he left the firm, he was also a frequent contributor on historical and literary subjects to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and an editor and historian of whom Scott and Byron spoke with admiration. He was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society in 1821.<br>
<br>In 1822 Palgrave was appointed a sub-commissioner of the record commission, and also began to read for the bar. He had been intent on antiquarian studies since his youth, and his interest in Anglo-Norman, and in the Anglo-Norman period, may have provided his first common ground with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27846/', "Dawson Turner")</script>, the Norfolk antiquary. On 13 October 1823 he married Dawson Turner's daughter Elizabeth (1799&#150;1852). Before his marriage he converted from Judaism to the Church of England, and changed his name by royal licence to Palgrave, the family name of Elizabeth's mother, Mary. There were four children of the marriage, all notably talented: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21158/', "Francis Turner Palgrave")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21159/', "William Gifford Palgrave")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61689/', "Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35366/', "Sir Reginald Francis Douce Palgrave")</script>.<br>
<br>Palgrave was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1827, and found a successful practice in peerage cases, but his interest was increasingly engaged by the business of archives. His <span class="italic">Parliamentary Writs and Writs of Military Summons</span> was published by the record commission in two volumes in 1827 and 1834, and <span class="italic">Rotuli curiae regis: rolls and records of the court held before the king's justiciars or justices</span> in 1831.<br>
<br>Palgrave's marriage was a source of strength to him, as well as an obvious social advantage. It brought him no accession of wealth, however, for his wife had five sisters with claims upon their father's fortune, and until 1831 Palgrave had to maintain his own father, who had no other resource. He had useful political connections, including access to Holland House [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>], and enjoyed manifest professional success, but his early history made him anxious about the security of his income.<br>
<br>In his extensive editorial work Palgrave employed transcribers, both for the publications which he undertook for the record commission and on his own account. The brothers Thomas Duffus Hardy and William Hardy were among them, and his association with them bred largely trivial but long-enduring animosities. The troubles seem to have begun with disputes over the terms of their employment, and to have flared into intrigue in and out of the office, and on one occasion into a brawl. The Hardys despised Palgrave for his birth and resented his undeniable accomplishments; he on his side was proud and, beneath his remarkable outward composure, irritably sensitive to slights. The record commission was itself a notable focus of scholarly contention and much ill feeling, and after its demise in 1837 several of its feuds echoed through the century.<br>
<br>Palgrave was made a KH in 1832. In 1833 he was appointed to the municipal corporations commission, but though he took part in its investigations he did not sign its final report, and submitted a memorandum of his own which the Webbs subsequently praised. In 1834 he succeeded John Caley as the keeper of the records in the chapter house at Westminster. The building was leased to the crown as a repository for the ancient records of the exchequer, including <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, and a mass of parliamentary material. One of the most original and valuable of Palgrave's editorial works, <span class="italic">The Ancient Kalendars and Inventories of the Treasury of H. M. Exchequer</span>, appeared in 1836. The chapter house and its great archival hoard had narrowly escaped destruction in the fire of 1834, an event which spurred on public discussion of a secure general record office. When the <span class="roman">Public Record Office Act</span>  (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 94) was passed in 1838 Palgrave was, in point both of his administrative and political experience, and of his scholarship, the obvious choice for its executive head.<br>
<br>There was, however, a delay of some months, from September to December 1838, in confirming the appointment, caused by Palgrave's own sensitivities and financial concerns, Treasury intransigence over the salary to be offered, and some reservations which the master of the rolls, Lord Langdale, had over the quasi-ministerial role which the act had visited upon him. The hiatus led Thomas Duffus Hardy to suppose, quite erroneously, that he had himself been denied the post by some political machination. It was an ominous beginning to what was essentially a felicitous appointment, for though Langdale appreciated Palgrave's merits, his relations with Palgrave were never entirely easy, while Hardy was a watchful colleague and, like his brother, an unforgiving enemy.<br>
<br>Palgrave's first care was to assemble the public records on the Rolls estate, in Chancery Lane, which became the designated site of the projected office, and to obtain funds to build a secure repository for them. In both endeavours he was strongly though not always harmoniously supported by Henry Cole, a senior assistant keeper. The records, ranging from the ponderous but generally well-ordered series of the great rolls of the exchequer to mouldering and congealed masses of loose parchment, came from more than fifty places in London and Westminster, principally the chapter house and the Tower, but including Carlton Ride, Somerset House, Lincoln's Inn, and the Temple. They rapidly filled what space remained in Rolls House and the Rolls chapel, where divine service was regularly conducted over and among them, and they packed the ramshackle tenements which stood in the grounds and along Chancery Lane. The foundation-stone of the new building, which was designed by Sir James Pennethorne, was not laid until 1851, and the repository then took nine years to build and occupy. By the time it was complete the records, which now included the contents of the state paper office, far outran its capacity, and an extension was begun in 1863.<br>
<br>Palgrave would not move <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> from Westminster until its new quarters were secure, but he then allowed it to be taken to Southampton to be photographed by the Ordnance Survey and published in facsimile in 1861&#150;3. He was deeply anxious for its safety, but it was a characteristically imaginative decision. So, ten years earlier, was his resolve to save the enumerators' returns for the decennial census, when the registrar-general proposed to destroy them.<br>
<br>Palgrave had a genuine feeling for archives and a clear view of the historical potential of modern records, which was rare at the time. His professional sense was essentially self-inculcated, like the librarianship of Anthony Panizzi (of the British Museum), with whom he bears some comparison. Hypersensitive himself, he was not always a tactful manager, but he worked in difficult circumstances, and his accomplishments were formidable. The first twenty-two of the deputy keeper's reports show Palgrave and his colleagues collecting and gradually ordering the public records. The chief problems lay in the sheer profusion and the very various physical condition of the documents, which comprised both comparatively lucid series such as the chancery rolls and innumerable sacks of loose parchments and papers. Palgrave's achievement was to direct their assembly and secure accommodation, to supervise their arrangement and begin their listing for the first time as a single holding, and to enable the public to refer to them as a matter of right, and without the payment of fees for literary searches. He also constantly looked ahead to the acquisition and management of modern administrative records. He sought from the beginning to maintain the historical coherence of the records of all periods, but sanctioned the creation of some special categories, such as royal letters, ministers' accounts, and rentals and surveys, which despite their specious interest are in the long run a hindrance rather than an aid to research. They have to be seen, however, against an oppressive mass of material and the concomitant problems of conservation which it posed. Palgrave's annual reports are a monument to his understanding of fundamentals, and the office has developed ever since upon the general lines which he established.<br>
<br>Palgrave's historical works are of less consequence than his editions of documents, though some, such as <span class="italic">The Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth</span> (1832), contain matter still of interest. In his medieval studies he emphasized the legacy of Rome in thought and institutions, but later English scholars dwelt rather upon the influence of Germanic traditions. Both approaches had their value, but each distorted the issues when deployed in isolation. Medieval scholarship was still inchoate in England, and Palgrave's works bear comparison well with others of their time; he was certainly on firm ground in seeking to consider England and Normandy together. Palgrave's scholarship was genuinely cosmopolitan, and his interests were wide: his publications include the first edition of the <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Northern Italy</span>, produced by John Murray in 1842. Palgrave continued in post until the end of his life, though his health was evidently failing in the last months. He died on 6 July 1861 at The Green, Hampstead, where he had lived since 1846, and was buried at Irstead, Norfolk, beside his wife, who had died in August 1852.<br>
