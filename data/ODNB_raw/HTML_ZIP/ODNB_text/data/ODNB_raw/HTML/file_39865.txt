<span class="headword">Boyd, Sir  John McFarlane</span>  (1917&#150;1989), <span class="occ">trade unionist and Salvationist</span>, was born on 8 October 1917 in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, the only child of James Boyd, butcher, who died in the influenza epidemic of the following year, and his wife, Mary Marshall, who in 1920 married John Burns, collier, with whom she had two further sons. John was welcomed by his stepfather as his own son, but John Burns's earnings were irregular, and after the 1926 general strike he had no work until the outbreak of the Second World War. Boyd was therefore brought up in considerable poverty, and later recalled that until he was fourteen the only boots he possessed were supplied by the parish. He attended Hamilton Street elementary school and Motherwell and Glencairn secondary school, earning money for the family by delivering newspapers and milk. In 1932 he left school early to take up one of the few engineering apprenticeships at the Lanarkshire Steel Company and at the same time joined the apprentices' section of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). He thus added a second element to his future career, for he had at the age of ten joined the Salvation Army. In 1932 he signed the Salvationist articles of war, was sworn in as a senior soldier, and graduated to a BBb bass in the Motherwell corps; his tuba, he noted, was &#145;easy to play but heavy&#146;.<br>
<br>It was with a reputation as an open-air boy preacher that in 1937 Boyd took up the cause of junior workers at the Lanarkshire mill, on the claim of the AEU for the right to negotiate on their behalf. He found himself as one of the youthful leaders of a strike, which spread countrywide and achieved the union's objective on the apprenticeship question. After nine years as a craftsman and shop steward he was elected assistant divisional organizer in 1946, divisional organizer in 1949, and executive councillor for division one (Scotland) in 1953, the youngest member of the union ever to attain that office. He retained this post until 1975 when, following the untimely death of Jim Conway in an aeroplane crash, he was elected general secretary of the AEU until his retirement in 1982. During almost three decades of working from AEU headquarters in London, Boyd held almost every post in the labour movement available to him: president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1964; member of the general council of the Trades Union Congress in 1967&#150;75 and 1978&#150;82; and chairman of the Labour Party in 1967. He was also his union's chief negotiator in a number of industries including shipbuilding, atomic energy, electricity supply, paper making, iron and steel, and aluminium. He was a member of the council of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (1978&#150;82); a director of the British Steel Corporation (1981&#150;6), of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (1980&#150;85), of Industrial Training Services Ltd from 1980, and of International Computers Ltd (UK) from 1984; and a governor of the BBC (1982&#150;7). He was appointed CBE in 1974, knighted in 1979, elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1982, and in 1981, perhaps to his greatest satisfaction, received the Salvation Army's order of the Founder.<br>
<br>Boyd was a tall, well-built, kindly man, craggy of face and rich in the intonations of the Clydesider. His devotion to the Salvation Army never faltered, nor his sincerity in combining this with his role as a trade unionist. To him they both were aspects of his mission of service. &#145;Yours, in the Joys of Service&#146;, the words with which he ended his address to members urging them to elect him as general secretary of the AEU in 1974, was to him no cant phrase. It was the expression of a form of Christian socialism pursued at a time when this had ceased to be fashionable, but recognizable as a creed which had inspired many of his forebears in the trade union movement.<br>
<br>Much of Boyd's time within the AEU was spent weaning it away from communist and extreme left-wing influence. When he retired in 1982 the committed left had only two seats on the seven-man AEU executive. His hand was behind the introduction of the secret postal ballot for the election of AEU full-time officials, which was regarded with disfavour by many unions at the time, but later universally accepted. He was a doughty negotiator, persistent, fair, but sometimes tetchy, who sought to update his own organization. In this he did not wholly succeed before his retirement, and he left much still to be done. His efforts to absorb the draughtsmen into the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (AUEW) (as it was then called) proved, for both organizational and political reasons, to be an exercise in sentiment rather than reality. But he did much to leave his union in better condition than he found it. Above all, Boyd laid great emphasis on decency and trust; &#145;ye canna&#146;, he commented in disgust with an employers' representative who had abused his confidence, &#145;negotiate with liars&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1940 Boyd married a fellow Salvationist, Elizabeth, daughter of James McIntyre, steelworker. They had two daughters. Boyd died on 30 April 1989 at his home at 24 Pearl Court, Cornfield Terrace, Eastbourne, Sussex.<br>
