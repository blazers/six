<span class="headword">Lambton,  Antony Claud Frederick</span>, styled Lord Lambton  (1922&#150;2006), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born on 10 July 1922 at West Marden Hall, Emsworth, Sussex, the younger son of John Frederick Lambton, fifth earl of Durham (1884&#150;1970), and his first wife, Diana Mary (1901&#150;1924), only daughter of Granville Frederick Richard Farquhar, of Dalton Hall, Beverley, Yorkshire. After attending Harrow School, in 1941 Antony Lambton became heir to the family earldom in tragic circumstances, when his elder brother, John, shot himself. Lambton joined the Hampshire regiment in the same year, but was soon invalided out of the army due to eye trouble. (This affliction led him in later life always to wear sunglasses.) He went to work in a munitions factory, where he met the spirited Belinda Bridget (Bindy) Blew-Jones (1921&#150;2003), daughter of Major Douglas Holden Blew-Jones, of Westward Ho!, Devon. The couple married on 10 August 1942 and had five daughters followed by a son.<br>
<br>Lambton belonged to an illustrious political family. The first earl of Durham, John George Lambton, a radical whig MP, cabinet minister, ambassador to Russia, and governor-general of Canada, was famous for the Durham report of 1838, which led to self-government in the Canadian and subsequently other colonies. Several other ancestors had served as MPs, usually for their native co. Durham. Lambton's first cousin was Lord Dunglass, later Sir Alec Douglas-Home (prime minister in 1963&#150;4). It was therefore not surprising that Lambton embarked on a political career after the Second World War. Defeated in the general election of 1945, when he fought Chester-le-Street for the Conservatives, he served as a somewhat controversial councillor in Durham for two years before suffering a second parliamentary defeat, at Bishop Auckland in 1950. Refusing to rest on the fame of his family, he had worked hard within the Conservative organization in the north-east, becoming area president of the Young Conservatives. His reward was selection for the Conservative-held seat of Berwick upon Tweed, which he won in the general election of 1951. Although he was far from being an assiduous constituency MP, he held the seat until 1973.<br>
<br>As the scion of such a notable family, Lambton's prospects for advancement should have been bright. However, he was not universally popular among his colleagues. Even before he had entered parliament an astute Conservative colleague, the diarist Cuthbert Headlam, regarded him as &#145;an irritable and impatient man who does not suffer fools gladly&#146;  (Ball, 595). Lambton's maiden speech, delivered on 13 March 1952, was more controversial than the usual offering, and included a prescient warning about the likely effect of an ageing population on the social security budget. The next speaker, Labour's Harold Wilson, offered his congratulations; years later (during a speech in the House of Commons on 26 April 1966) Lambton joked that this was the only time that Wilson had ever spoken about him in civil terms.<br>
<br>In 1954 Lambton became parliamentary private secretary to the minister of supply, Selwyn Lloyd. This appointment took on greater significance in April 1955, when Lloyd was elevated to the cabinet as minister of defence, winning further promotion to foreign secretary in December. Yet Lambton's connection with Lloyd turned out to be a mixed blessing. Lloyd was foreign secretary during the Eden government's ill-fated Suez intervention, and although Lloyd stayed in his post after the humiliating British retreat, Lambton resigned. He was disgusted by the aftermath of Suez, and never forgave Eden's successor, Harold Macmillan. The ill feeling was reciprocated, which did little to help Lambton's hopes of promotion while Macmillan remained party leader.<br>
<br>During the next decade Lambton devoted much of his energy to cross-party back-bench initiatives. For example he played a key role in the passage of Roy Jenkins's <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span> in 1959. This was not the only respect in which Lambton deviated from the stereotype of a right-wing Conservative; for example he also advocated the decriminalization of cannabis. Lambton's idiosyncratic ideas&#151;often expressed in pungent contributions to the Beaverbrook press&#151;helped to debar him from preferment even when his cousin, Alec Douglas-Home, succeeded Macmillan as prime minister in 1963. His parliamentary career seemed fated to end in futility. He could, though, continue to raise issues close to his heart; in April 1969 he introduced a <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> into the House of Commons, and although the measure failed its supporters included Home and Margaret Thatcher.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1969 Home's successor as Conservative leader, Edward Heath, gave Lambton official responsibility to speak for the party on foreign affairs. The appointment signalled that Heath was willing to promote talented right-wingers&#151;even those, like Lambton, who disagreed with him on the key issue of Britain's relationship with the European Economic Community. Lambton had also worked for Heath's opponent, Reginald Maudling, in the Conservative leadership election of 1965. However, there was no question of Lambton's securing a cabinet position when his party unexpectedly won the general election of 1970. Instead, he was made an under-secretary within the Ministry of Defence; his area of special responsibility was the Royal Air Force.<br>
<br>It might have been better for Lambton if Heath had left him out of the government. Foreign affairs&#151;especially the politics of the Middle East&#151;continued to be his main interest, and he later confessed to being bored by his duties at the Ministry of Defence. His most notable contribution to political life in this period was his decision to renounce the earldom of Durham, which he inherited on his father's death in February 1970. Lambton had consistently argued that heirs should be able to renounce their peerages in order to stay in the House of Commons. However, he combined this view with a firm attachment to hereditary honours, and continued to insist (against the objections of procedural experts) that he should be known by the courtesy title of Lord Lambton for parliamentary purposes.<br>
<br>After three years of unremarkable service in junior office, Lambton suddenly created unwelcome headlines by resigning from the government in May 1973. Thanks to a concealed camera and microphone, a tabloid newspaper had secured evidence of Lambton's dealings with more than one prostitute; particularly damaging was a photograph of Lambton in bed with two prostitutes, smoking marijuana. Eventually this material was handed to the police, and Lambton was investigated by the secret services in case his activities had constituted a security risk, like those of John Profumo a decade earlier. Although there was no basis for this suspicion, it was impossible for Lambton to continue in office. He resigned his parliamentary seat and was later convicted of possession of cannabis. The lord privy seal, Lord Jellicoe, resigned shortly afterwards because of his own involvement with prostitutes.<br>
<br>After his resignation Lambton gave a television interview to Robin Day in which he frankly admitted to his relations with prostitutes, offering the explanation that &#145;people sometimes like variety. I think it's as simple as that and I think that impulse is understood by almost everybody&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 2 Jan 2007). After leaving public life he retired to the magnificent seventeenth-century Villa Cetinale, near Siena in Italy, taking a keen personal role in the restoration of the house and gardens. Although he never divorced his wife, his companion in this voluntary exile was Claire Ward, a noted society beauty. In the ensuing years his villa was visited by numerous politicians and pop stars; it was rumoured that Lambton presided over many dissolute parties, and he enjoyed playing practical jokes on his guests.<br>
<br>Apart from his love of women and gardening, Lambton wrote several books in retirement. A volume of short stories published in 1983 was followed by two novels, <span class="italic">Elizabeth and Alexandra</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">The Abbey in the Wood</span> (1986). These productions confirmed the impression that Lambton had considerable talents, but lacked the consistency of application that might have created a lasting legacy. Ironically his next and best-known book, <span class="italic">The Mountbattens</span> (1989), accused the late Lord Louis Mountbatten of exaggerating his own achievements. It could be countered that Lambton himself, for all his abilities, had few tangible achievements to exaggerate. More sympathetically, the erratic career of Antony Lambton could be used to exemplify the dilemmas that faced members of the aristocracy during a supposedly &#145;meritocratic&#146; era. His six children (who included the noted author and broadcaster Lady Lucinda Lambton, born in 1943) displayed enough ability, dynamism, and eccentricity to suggest that they would have become prominent people even if they had lacked social advantages. When he died at Villa Cetinale, Sovicille, on 30 December 2006, Lambton's obituarists concentrated on the sexual scandal that had ended his political career. He was cremated in his adopted home of Siena, and the ashes were buried in a specially restored chapel at his villa. His son Edward 
    (Ned; <i>b</i>. 1961)
   became seventh earl of Durham and inherited his father's entire estate, valued at &pound;11,800,360 net in England and Wales.<br>
