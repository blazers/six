<span class="headword">Lingard,  Richard</span>  (1633/4&#150;1670), <span class="occ">dean of Lismore</span>, was probably the son of <a name="cosubject_75570"></a><span class="headword">Richard Lingard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, with whom he has often been confused. The elder Lingard is said to have been educated at Cambridge University &#145;about the year 1620, or during the reign of King James&#146;  (Stokes, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 4) and proceeded to Ireland, where he was ordained deacon on 22 October 1621 and priest on 22 October 1622 by Thomas Ram, bishop of Ferns and Leighlin. He became vicar of Killaire on 5 November 1630 and by September 1633 had been collated to the vicarage of St Mary's, Athlone, and later to that of Killcleagh and the curacy of Ballyloughloe. In March 1639 he was appointed archdeacon of Clonmacnoise and was granted the rectorial tithes of his Athlone benefice as an augmentation by Charles I, the tithes of Ratoath, co. Meath, being added.<br>
<br>There is uncertainty regarding the elder Lingard's movements after 1641. Some authorities claim he left Ireland in 1645, others that he remained at Athlone until it fell to Ireton in 1651, and it is this uncertainty that has led to the confusion between him and his likely son. Nevertheless, strict contemporaries distinguished between the two men, and it seems probable that the elder Lingard did indeed leave Ireland at some point after 1641 to become the minister of Workington in Cumberland. It was there that he died in 1655, naming a son, Richard, in his will.<br>
<br>It seems likely that it was the younger Lingard who was admitted, aged fifteen, to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1649, graduating BA in 1653. Elected one of five senior fellows of Trinity College, Dublin, and lecturer in divinity in 1661, in the same year he was appointed to recover the library of James Ussher for the college, alongside the vice-chancellor, Jeremy Taylor, and the provost, Thomas Steele. On 4 June 1662 he was made vice-provost, and in the following November became public professor of divinity. On 25 January 1666 the grace of the house was passed for his degree of Doctor of Divinity. Shortly afterwards he was appointed dean of Lismore and designated vicar of the parish of St Andrew's, Dublin. For this reason he resigned his college positions as senior fellow, vice-provost, and senior dean on 6 April 1666.<br>
<br>Lingard's <span class="italic">Sermon Preached before the King at Whitehall July 26 1668: in Defence of the Liturgy</span> (1668) was his first published work. His only other publication, <span class="italic">A letter of advice to a young gentleman leaving the university concerning the behaviour and conversation in the world</span> (1670), was written for the benefit of his friend James Lane at the request of the latter's father, Viscount Lanesborough. Lingard may have visited Oxford as a grace of convocation on 15 July 1670, and was passed there for a DD in 1670, though it is not known whether he actually took the degree. A letter from Charles II to the lord lieutenant of Ireland on 3 August 1669 proposed that he be advanced to the bishopric of Raphoe, but he died before this came to pass, on 11 November 1670. He was buried in the college chapel on 13 November. The fact that he left in his will rent from land in Cumberland provides a further telling link of his likely parentage. <span class="italic">An elegy and funeral oration on the death of the Rev. Dr. R. Lingard, dean of Lismore and public professor of divinity</span> was published in Dublin in 1671.<br>
