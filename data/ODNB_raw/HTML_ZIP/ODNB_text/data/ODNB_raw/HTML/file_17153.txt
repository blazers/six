<span class="headword">Lucy,  William</span>  (1594&#150;1677), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was born at Hurstbourne, Hampshire, the fourth son of Sir Thomas Lucy (1551&#150;1605) of Charlecote, Warwickshire, and his second wife, Constance, daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75329/', "Richard Kingsmill (c.1528&#150;1600)")</script> of Highclere, Hampshire; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17152/', "Sir Thomas Lucy (1583x6&#150;1640)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17150/', "Sir Richard Lucy (1592&#150;1667)")</script> were his elder brothers. In 1610 he was admitted to Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 18 November 1613. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 25 May 1614 but &#145;upon second thoughts, and perhaps a desire of a sedate and academical life&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1127) he entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner on 12 June 1615. He proceeded MA the following year and was ordained deacon at London on 21 December 1617. In 1619 Lucy became rector of Burghclere, Hampshire. Several years later he was appointed chaplain to the duke of Buckingham, on the recommendation of James I. Appointed as a university preacher at Cambridge in 1620 Lucy gained notoriety for delivering on commencement Sunday 1622, before the largely Calvinist university, an anti-Calvinist sermon which Joseph Meade described as being &#145;totally for Arminanisme, wonderfully bold and peremptorily, styling some passages to the contrary by names of blasphemie etc.&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 389, fol. 213). The scandal over the sermon led to calls for Lucy to be denied higher degrees, but he escaped censure and in 1623 proceeded BD and DD with the support of the king against what appears to have been heavy opposition. Three years later he was appointed rector of Highclere, Hampshire. On 12 February 1629 at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, Lucy married Martha (1608&#150;1674), daughter of William Angel. They had two daughters and five sons, including Spencer Lucy (1643/4&#150;1691).<br>
<br>Lucy lived at Burghclere until the outbreak of the civil war, when, as a staunch royalist, he was &#145;both active and passive to his ability in the great cause&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 146, fol. 133). His house was searched and his extensive library seized. An informer suggested that he was raising money for the duke of York. In April 1651 the committee for compounding ordered his estates in Hampshire to be seized. After being sent a copy of Thomas Hobbes's <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> (1651), and noting its popularity with local gentlemen, Lucy composed <span class="italic">Examinations, Censures and Confutations of Divers Errours in the Two First Chapters of Mr Hobbes his Leviathan</span> (1657), published under the pseudonym William Pike (a play on his name). He followed this with <span class="italic">Observations, Censures and Confutations of Divers Errors in the 12, 13 and 14 Chap. Of Mr Hobs his Leviathan</span> (1658), dedicated to William Seymour, marquess of Hertford. These two works were extended and republished as <span class="italic">Notorious Errours in Mr Hobbes his Leviathan</span> (1663), dedicated to the earl of Clarendon. Lucy completed his critique of <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> with his <span class="italic">Second Part of Observations, Censures and Confutations</span> (1673); this work included a postscript censuring Hobbes's Latin edition of <span class="italic">Leviathan</span> (1668). Lucy's often obtuse animadversions of Hobbes's ideas rarely achieve great originality and largely rely upon the restatement of traditional scholastic ideas which were fast moving out of fashion. For this reason his critique did not find much favour among contemporaries. Henry Stubbe commented that many of the things that Lucy objected to in Hobbes were &#145;admitted generally, by those who had learned to search into nature, &amp; not to acquiesce in ye traditions of others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes</span>, 1.440). In addition to his work against Hobbes, Lucy also composed in the 1650s <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Nature of a Minister</span>, a defence of episcopal authority in the apostolic church against the New England congregationalist Thomas Hooker's <span class="italic">A Survey of the Summe of Church-Discipline</span> (1648). Lucy eventually published his book in 1670.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Lucy's loyalty was rewarded when, on 11 October 1660, he was elected bishop of St David's, his confirmation and consecration taking place on 17 and 18 November 1660. He is recorded as being present at the Savoy conference, but he took no part in the debates. Lucy faced a difficult task at St David's. Episcopal administration of the diocese, one of the largest and poorest in Britain, had effectively ceased in 1640. The cathedral at St David's, the collegiate church at Brecon, and the bishop's houses at Brecon and Abergwili were practically in ruins, the decay exacerbated by plundering during the interregnum. Lucy's effectiveness as an administrator is a subject of some debate. He was posthumously charged with having &#145;lived in a woeful and culpable omission of many of the direct and important as well sacred as other duties of his office&#146;  (Ferguson, 21&#150;2). He is said to have neglected to hold confirmations in his diocese and to have connived at the exaction of exorbitant fees, as well as filling the cathedral with non-residents and preferring royalists and his own family exclusively to benefices in the diocese. Some of these charges were justified: his son Spencer, for instance, became in 1669 vicar of Penbryn, Cardiganshire, and canon and treasurer of St David's. However, Lucy's transgressions went hand in hand with his attempts to combat religious dissent and revive the fortunes of the church in his diocese. He does appear to have made considerable efforts to improve the condition of the diocese. Large sums were spent in the restoration of the collegiate church and the bishop's and prebendary's houses at Brecon as well as sums in augmentation of poor vicarages. Bishop Thomas Burgess, Lucy's nineteenth-century successor and champion, considered that Lucy could be considered &#145;the second founder of the College at Brecknock&#146;  (Burgess, 25&#150;6).<br>
<br>Lucy also fought tenaciously to preserve his authority as bishop in the see. William Nicholson, bishop of Gloucester, had been allowed to retain his archdeaconry of Brecon <i>in commendam</i>. In 1663 he claimed the right of holding visitations and correcting faults in the clergy of Lucy's diocese. Lucy denied Nicholson's claims, although the extent of the archdeacon's jurisdiction was far from clear. The controversy led to the suspension of archidiaconal visitations and the controversy had to be referred to the bishops of London and St Asaph who in 1665 finally ruled in favour of Lucy. One result of the quarrel was that the right of holding visitations in the diocese of St David's remained in abeyance until the nineteenth century. However, <span class="italic">Articles of Visitation and Enquiry</span> were published not only in 1662 but also in 1671, revealing Lucy to be an early exponent, among Restoration bishops, of railing in the altar at the east end of the chancel.<br>
<br>Lucy's final years at St David's were marked by his progressive physical deterioration, which prevented him from travelling. In a letter to Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon in 1675 he describes himself as a &#145;poor old man, who hath not beene 2 miles from his house this 3 last yeares&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 42, fol. 142). However, when he drew up his will, on 3 September 1677, he pronounced himself in perfect health, apart from a little lameness, stemming from gout. This scourge of sectaries and dissenters declared himself convinced of the validity of the Church of England as by law established, but conceded &#145;some things may be amended in it as whatsoever is ordered by humane Reason will have deficiency in it (although such reason doth take scripture for its guidance)&#146;. However, &#145;I feare he who shall undertake to amend it may probably doe harme then good by that adventure&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/355, sig. 99). He died on 4 October 1677 and was buried in the collegiate church of Brecon.<br>
