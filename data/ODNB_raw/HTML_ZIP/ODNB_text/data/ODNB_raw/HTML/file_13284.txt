<span class="headword">Hill,  Joseph</span>  (1667&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Salisbury on 11 October 1667, of godly parents. After receiving his early education from Thomas Taylor (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;1677), an ejected minister, he entered the free school at Salisbury before he was seven, where he remained for nine years. He was then sent to Charles Morton's celebrated academy at Newington Green, until it was broken up two years later, in 1685, as a result of persecution. After studying for a year under Samuel Sprint at Andover, Hampshire, where he became proficient in Hebrew, he returned to London to complete his studies &#145;with such who had been Mr Moreton's pupils, who attended at this time weekly lectures, read to them by Mr Glascock&#146;  (Wood, 30). As a result he was noticed by Richard Stretton, who recommended him as chaplain and tutor to Lady Irby (<i>d</i>. 1695), with whom he lived for nearly seven years. He was ordained on 23 June 1694 with Edmund Calamy and others.<br>
<br>Hill was minister of the Presbyterian meeting at Swallow Street, Westminster, until 1699, when he accepted an invitation to be minister of the English Presbyterian Church at Rotterdam. He was called to the meeting at Haberdasher's Hall, Cheapside, on 16 February 1718 and remained there until his death. He was an orthodox subscriber at the Salters' Hall controversy in 1719. Shortly before his death he was chosen to preach the expository lecture on Wednesday evenings at Little St Helen's meeting-house. His only publication was a sermon preached to the society. Hill was not a popular preacher, and the congregation was left in a very declining state. It revived briefly under Stephen Ford, but the church was dissolved in 1734. Hill and his wife, Martha, had no children, and he died in London on 21 January 1729. Hill has been confused with his more celebrated namesake and fellow Presbyterian minister Joseph Hill (1625&#150;1707).<br>
