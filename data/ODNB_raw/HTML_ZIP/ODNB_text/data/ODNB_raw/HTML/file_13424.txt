<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hodges, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1714), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born about 1645, the son of John Hodges of Cotherstock, or Cotterstock, in Northamptonshire. Little is known of his family background beyond the information supplied when he received a grant of arms in 1698, and it seems likely that his origins were humble. He married in 1681 (by licence granted on 25 April) Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1717), the daughter and coheir of Joseph Hall, a merchant of London and Balasore in India. He may have begun his career in the service of the East India Company&#151;his wife was the daughter of a Bengal factor, and he himself was to act as the company's agent in Spain&#151;but by 1683 he was established in Cadiz, where the hospitality he afforded the visiting Samuel Pepys formed the basis of an enduring friendship.<br>
<br>Hodges first came to prominence in the mid-1690s, when his firm provided cash advances for the victualling of Admiral Edward Russell's Mediterranean Fleet. For this and other important services in support of the war effort, and also to compensate him for the Treasury's slowness in settling his account, he was granted a baronetcy in 1697. Three years later he decided to return to England, perhaps because his only child, a twelve-year-old son, who had hitherto been educated privately at home (as Hodges himself told Pepys, &#145;for reasons you may imagine&#146;), was fast approaching adolescence. Hodges's great wealth and his close associations with prominent City of London families, such as the Houblons (his own close friends) and the Hernes (his wife's relations), made him a natural recruit to the board of the Bank of England, to which he was chosen a director in 1703. At the general election of 1705 he took a further step towards eminence in public life when his money bought a parliamentary seat for the corrupt Cornish borough of Mitchell. Like many another representative of the &#145;moneyed interest&#146;, which to its critics was growing fat on the profits of continental warfare, he took his place in the ranks of the whig party in the House of Commons, but he was always a pragmatist in politics and displayed moderation rather than party zeal. He was also, it would appear, a staunch churchman and no particular friend to protestant dissenters. After standing down at the 1710 election he maintained good relations with the predominantly tory administration established by Robert Harley. Each needed the other: Hodges's many commercial interests could derive considerable benefit from the favour of government, while Harley, for his part, was looking to recruit moderate whigs in the bank and East India Company (to which Hodges was elected as a director, for one year, in 1712) to help him construct his own &#145;party&#146; in the City and maintain public credit. Thus Hodges' son Joseph was given employment in the lottery office in 1712, while Sir William himself advised the ministry on the settlement of the Spanish trade after the treaty of Utrecht.<br>
<br>Hodges died in London between 14 and 29 July 1714, and was buried in his parish church of St Stephen, Coleman Street, on 31 July, after a funeral of unusual magnificence, even for one of the great merchant princes of London. His son, Joseph Hodges, after inheriting a great fortune in money and stocks, went to live abroad, first in France and then in Spain, where he entirely wasted his inheritance and died, unmarried, in 1722. The baronetcy was thereby extinguished.<br>
<br>Hodges has been identified erroneously with the &#145;William Hodges, mariner&#146;, who between 1693 and 1699 published at least five pamphlets as part of a one-man campaign to improve the methods of paying naval wages and thus ameliorate the miserable conditions suffered by English sailors. However, Sir William's prolonged residence in Spain at this time, and the failure of the last pamphlet in the series to reflect the acquisition of his title, renders this identification impossible.<br>
