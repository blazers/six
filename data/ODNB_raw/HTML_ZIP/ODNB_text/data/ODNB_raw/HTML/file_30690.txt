</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  (Isaac) Lowthian</span>, first baronet  (1816&#150;1904), <span class="occ">iron and steel manufacturer</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 February 1816, the eldest of four sons (out of seven children) of Thomas Bell (1774&#150;1845), chemical and iron manufacturer, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lowthian (<i>d</i>. 1875). Lowthian Bell (as he was usually known) was steeped in the local coal, iron, and shipbuilding industries. His father operated the Walker ironworks for the firm of which he later became a partner, Losh, Wilson, and Bell, and his family had links with Lord Dundonald, who had pioneered the Leblanc soda process in England. A second brother, Thomas, was involved in the iron trade; a third brother, John, became a geologist and an important adviser to the family.<br>
<br>After a nonconformist education at Bruce's academy, Newcastle, Bell visited Germany and Denmark before attending Edinburgh University. He then went to the Sorbonne, and later finished what was an unusually wide (and influential) continental education by undertaking practical work on alkali manufacture at Marseilles. He joined the Walker ironworks in 1835, aged nineteen, and under the influence of the firm's rolling-mill superintendent, John Vaughan, he began studying the operations of blast furnaces and rolling mills. A desire to master thoroughly the technology of any manufacturing process was to be one of the hallmarks of Bell's career. In 1842 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1886), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21582/', "Hugh Lee Pattinson")</script>, a well-known chemical manufacturer. The couple had two sons and three daughters. Eight years later Bell started his own chemical factory at Washington in Gateshead, where he operated the new French Deville patent, used in the manufacture of aluminium. Bell expanded these chemical interests in the mid-1860s, when he developed with his brother John a large salt working near the ironworks.<br>
<br>In 1844 Lowthian Bell and his brothers Thomas and John formed a new company, Bell Brothers, to operate the Wylam ironworks. These works, based at Port Clarence on the Tees, began pig-iron production with three blast furnaces in 1854 and became one of the leading plants in the north-east iron industry. The firm's output had reached 200,000 tons by 1878 and the firm employed about 6000 men. The company's need for ironstone led to the association of Bell Brothers with Ralph Ward Jackson, who leased the Bells important ironstone beds. Bell and Jackson then built the Cleveland Railway to convey material to the Clarence works, thus freeing the company from the railway monopoly formed by the local Quaker industrialist Joseph Pease. It was part of a strategy which allowed Bell eventually to control his own supplies of coal, ironstone, and limestone&#151;all carried on railways free of freight charges set by his rivals.<br>
<br>Jackson's activities later bankrupted him, and Bell bought out certain of his colliery properties. In the aftermath Jackson's railway interests (he had also promoted the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway Company) were acquired by the North Eastern Railway (NER). The latter also negotiated for the purchase of the Cleveland Railway and in 1865 Bell became an NER director, a post he held until his death. From 1895 until 1904 Bell was deputy chairman of the company. He was not the only industrialist on the NER board, though he was one of the most influential. He ensured that the local ironmasters were well protected by a sliding scale of rates; and the NER also funded attempts at the Bell ironworks to rid Cleveland iron of the phosphorus which prevented its use in the manufacture of rails and other products. Bell also influenced policy making at the NER with a wide-ranging series of policy papers on matters as diverse as operating costs and investment in new technology. These papers are said to have been &#145;remarkable for the statistical concepts employed, for the lucidity of analysis and above all for their bearing on the question of costs, the most pressing business problem of the organisation at that time&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
<br>In the face of competition from steel, the demand for iron inevitably weakened after the late 1870s. In 1889 Bell therefore erected open-hearth furnaces at Clarence and began utilizing Cleveland pig iron for the manufacture of steel. The business was competently launched, but competition in the UK steel industry was by now keen, and an ageing Bell and his managers were too old to pioneer steel technology as successfully as they had iron. In 1899, therefore&#151;when Bells became a public company&#151;the more dynamic neighbouring steel firm of Dorman Long took a half share. In 1902 the latter acquired Bells' remaining ordinary shares in exchange for 225,000 shares in Dormans and the merger was complete. Bells survived as a separate iron and steel firm through the First World War, but the Clarence works was to close in the inter-war depression, when the Dorman empire fell on hard times. Bell's eldest son, (Thomas) Hugh Bell (1844&#150;1931), who succeeded to the baronetcy, was later associated with Dorman Long.<br>
<br>Bell's reputation depended not only on his career as a mostly successful company manager. For over a quarter of a century he was the unchallenged spokesman for the north-eastern iron industry, and was recognized as one of the &#145;fathers&#146; of the trade. He was also a respected scientist who was recognized as a world authority on blast-furnace technology. The way in which he combined business and science was unusual in Victorian Britain: nevertheless, his abilities as chemist, mineralogist, and metallurgist challenge the view that the economy at that time was run only by empiricists. His principal works, which combined technical knowledge with international comparative surveys, can still be read with profit. They include: <span class="italic">The Principles of the Manufacture of Iron and Steel</span> (1884); <span class="italic">The Iron Trade of the United Kingdom</span> (1886); <span class="italic">The Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting</span> (1872); <span class="italic">Notes on a Visit to Coal and Iron Mines and Ironworks in the United States</span> (1875); <span class="italic">Report on the iron manufacture of the United States of America, and a comparison &hellip; with &hellip; Great Britain</span> (1877). His writings, when they discussed non-technical matters, espoused a guardedly optimistic view of British industry. He was anti-protectionist, committed to competitive wage rates, and&#151;not surprisingly&#151;a promoter of attempts to improve the scientific base of British industry.<br>
<br>Bell's sensitivity to Britain's declining competitive standing (nurtured by frequent trips abroad, especially to the USA) and his commitment to technology, management, and labour relations led logically to his strong support for more business and technical organizations. He helped to create the British Iron Trade Association in 1875 (and became its first president) and was a key instigator in the formation in 1869 of the Iron and Steel Institute. He was the third president of the latter in 1873, when the institute held its first meeting overseas. Typically, Bell gave his presidential address in French. In the following year, when he was again president, he was the first recipient of the Bessemer gold medal. He was also involved with the Institute of Mining Engineers and was its president in the year of his death. Closer to home, he was an active supporter of Armstrong College at Newcastle.<br>
<br>Besides receiving awards from technical societies (such as the Albert medal of the Society of Arts in 1900), Bell was also elected FRS in 1875 and in the 1880s and 1890s he accepted a string of honorary degrees. He was twice mayor of Newcastle and was deputy lieutenant and high sheriff for the county of Durham. A liberal in politics, he eventually became MP for Hartlepool in 1875, but took little part in Commons life. He was a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1878) and, on Gladstone's nomination, he received a baronetcy in 1885. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41106/', "Florence Bell")</script> was his daughter-in-law and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30686/', "Gertrude Bell")</script> was his granddaughter.<br>
<br>In his later years Bell looked every inch the typical Victorian middle-class industrialist: broad-shouldered, heavily bearded, eminently worthy. His passionate belief in the application of science to industry, however, did mark him out as someone unusual among his contemporaries. His moderation and lucidity, and his rigid adherence to the evidence and scientific facts, were recognized as being among his chief qualities. His contemporaries had no doubts about his standing and spoke of him having &#145;made a name that will live in history with those of Bessemer, Siemens and others &hellip; who devoted so large a portion of their careers to the scientific study of the manufacture of iron and steel&#146;  (<span class="italic">North-Eastern Daily Gazette</span>). Yet Bell lacked the flash of genius or egotism that was apparent in men such as Bessemer and Siemens; and that may explain why his historical profile has always seemed less prominent than that of the other great Victorian engineers. It was perhaps typical of Bell that, despite his massive researches into separating phosphorus from pig iron, the technical problem was eventually solved by Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, who had started his career as a police court clerk. It was typical, too, that such was Bell's generosity of spirit that he was the first to hail Thomas's success in pre-empting him.<br>
<br>Active until the end, Sir Lowthian Bell died at his home, Rounton Grange, Rounton, Northallerton, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 20 December 1904. He was buried at Rounton on 23 December.<br>
