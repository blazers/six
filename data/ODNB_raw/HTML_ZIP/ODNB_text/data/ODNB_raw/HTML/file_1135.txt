</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Samuel White</span>  (1821&#150;1893), <span class="occ">traveller and explorer in Africa</span>, was born on 8 June 1821 in London, the second of the eight children of Samuel Baker (<i>d</i>. 1862) of Lypiatt Park, Gloucestershire, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Dobson of Enfield, Middlesex. His father was a wealthy shipowner who had sugar plantations in Mauritius and Jamaica and had served as a director of the Great Western Railway and chairman of the Gloucester Bank. His elder brother died in childhood and Baker eventually inherited his father's wealth.<h2>
<a name="Educationyouthfulhuntingandfirstmarriage"></a>Education, youthful hunting, and first marriage</h2>Baker, who had a fair complexion, light hair, and piercing blue eyes, lived most of his early years in Enfield. When he was twelve his family rented a house from Sir John Guise, at Highnam Court, about 2 miles from Gloucester. He first studied in a private school at Rottingdean, and from 1833 to 1835 he attended College School, Gloucester. He benefited little from these schools, possibly because he refused to accept the discipline and conformity required by the public school system. In 1838, however, his attitude towards learning changed: the Revd Henry Peter Dunster, a private tutor in Tottenham, accepted Baker as a pupil and interested him in history, geography, and the classics. In 1840 Baker departed for Germany to finish his education. Although he attended lectures and learned the German language, he devoted most of his eighteen months in Germany to hunting. He also perfected his knowledge of the rifle and devised a massive charge of 16 drams of powder for use against larger game.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Baker and his brother John, in a double ceremony on 3 August 1843, married sisters, Henrietta Biddulph (<i>d</i>. 1855) and Elizabeth, daughters of Charles Martin, rector of Maisemore. After a brief, unsuccessful, stint in his father's London office in Fenchurch Street, Baker travelled to Mauritius in early 1845, where he and John managed Fairfund, the family estate on the island. However, he spent only a few months on the island, which he found too restricting and utterly boring.<h2>
<a name="PlantingandhuntinginCeylon"></a>Planting and hunting in Ceylon</h2>In late 1845 Baker relocated to Ceylon, ostensibly to establish a coffee plantation and an English colony at Nuwera Eliya, a station 6000 feet above sea level and 115 miles from Colombo by road. It was a sad reunion when his wife joined him the following year. His son Charles had died in Mauritius, and in September 1846 his daughter Jane succumbed to fever at sea off the Maldive Islands. Despite these tragedies, Baker continued with his colonization scheme. He purchased land from the government and persuaded his brothers John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1142/', "Valentine Baker (1827&#150;1887)")</script> to join the enterprise. In September 1848 the <i>Earl of Hardwicke</i> set sail from London with a party of eighteen adults and a cargo of stock, machinery, seeds, and hounds. Initially the struggling colony suffered as poor soil conditions restricted farming and wild animals often ate the crops. Eventually, however, the settlers overcame these difficulties and established a relatively prosperous estate which remained in the Baker family throughout the century.<br>
<br>In his nine years in Ceylon, Baker explored much of the island and established an impressive reputation as a big game hunter. During his many elephant- and stag-hunting expeditions, he experimented with new rifles, stalking methods, and ballistic techniques. He recounted his experiences in <span class="italic">The Rifle and Hound in Ceylon</span> (1853), and in <span class="italic">Eight Years' Wanderings in Ceylon</span>, which appeared two years later. In 1855 a fever-stricken Baker returned with his family to England. After the unexpected death of his wife from typhus fever on 29 December 1855 at Bagn&egrave;res-de-Bigorre, France, Baker sought consolation and solace by volunteering for the Crimean War; unfortunately, he arrived at the front just as Britain and Russia had concluded a peace agreement. Baker then spent time hunting in the Balkans. Afterwards, he contemplated becoming an unofficial spy to report on Russian military designs against India. After returning to England, Baker also considered entering the service of the Anglican church.<h2>
<a name="TravelsineasternEuropeandAsiaMinoracquisitionofFlorence"></a>Travels in eastern Europe and Asia Minor: acquisition of Florence</h2>Finally, in November 1858, Baker decided to resolve his personal problems by embarking on a hunting trip down the Danube River with Maharaja Duleep Singh, the hereditary ruler of the Punjab, who had been living in England since his dispossession. After the boat in which they were travelling collided with an ice floe, Baker and the maharaja abandoned the vessel and took refuge in the Danube town of Widden. While in the town they attended a slave auction where Baker unexpectedly bought a young woman named Florence Barbara Maria Finnian von Sass (1841&#150;1916) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42346/', "Baker, Florence Barbara Maria")</script>]. Shortly thereafter they travelled to Bucharest and eventually both ended up in the Black Sea port of Constanza. In March 1859 Baker accepted a position as manager-general with the Danube and Black Sea Railway which planned to build a line from Constanza to the Danube east of Bucharest. After this project was completed in October 1860, Baker and Florence journeyed through Asia Minor, spending several months hunting in the Sapanca region.<br>
<br>During his time in eastern Europe and Asia Minor, Baker became increasingly intrigued by the prospect of exploring Africa. After John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant departed from Bagamoyo for Lake Victoria and the White Nile on 2 October 1860, Baker decided to launch his own expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River. He then planned to link up with Speke and Grant. The journey, which ultimately would take four and a half years, would bring him fame and fortune. More importantly, the expedition enabled Baker and Florence, who were not married, to escape the harsh moral strictures of Victorian England.<h2>
<a name="TheNileexpedition18611865"></a>The Nile expedition, 1861&#150;1865</h2>On 15 April 1861 Baker and Florence left Cairo in a <i>dahabia</i>&#151;a vessel similar to a dhow&#151;for a twenty-six-day trip up the Nile to Korosko. The couple then went by camel caravan from Kassala to the Sudanese&#150;Abyssinian border to explore the eastern tributaries of the Nile. Baker&#151;who established his headquarters at Sofi, a village along the banks of the Atbara River&#151;spent five months exploring the Setit River, a tributary of the Atbara, and hunting big game, often with the Hamran Arabs. He also explored other tributaries of the Atbara, including the Bahr Salamat and the Angareb, and then travelled along the Rehad to its confluence with the Blue Nile. After completing this phase of the expedition, Baker and Florence marched to Khartoum, where they arrived on 11 June 1862. The results of this fourteen-month journey, while not overly significant, were nevertheless impressive. Sir Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, acknowledged the importance of Baker's explorations and his discovery that the Nile sediment was due to the Abyssinian tributaries. Additionally, Baker gained experience as an African explorer, mastered Arabic, and learned to use the astronomical instruments which were vital for determining geographical locations.<br>
<br>For the next six months Baker remained in Khartoum, waiting for the end of the rainy season and preparing for the next phase of his expedition. On 18 December 1862 he started up the Nile with a <i>dahabia</i>, two sailing barges (known as <i>nuggars</i>), twenty-nine transport animals, and a party of ninety-six, including forty-five armed men and forty sailors. On 2 February 1863 this expedition reached Gondokoro, an important headquarters for the Arab slave trade. Baker immediately clashed with Arab slave traders and the local Bari people, both of whom considered him a spy of the British government. Additionally, the Arabs feared that the Englishman would try to end the lucrative slave trade. Consequently, they encouraged two mutinies among Baker's men, the second of which resulted in several desertions. On 15 February 1863 Speke and Grant arrived in Gondokoro, after more than two years of exploration work in east Africa. Baker provided them with his surplus supplies and three vessels for the trip down the Nile. In return, Speke informed Baker of a second unexplored lake, the Luta N'zig&eacute;, west of Bunyoro, and urged him to complete the discovery of the Nile source. Speke also gave him his own maps. Lastly, the two explorers promised to keep Baker's relationship with Florence a secret after they reached England.<br>
<br>Preparing for the next phase of his trip, Baker had to contend with Arab slave traders who were determined to prevent him from travelling to the south. To break free of Gondokoro, Baker, who experienced difficulty getting provisions and persuading porters to march through hostile territory, attached his small party to a large ivory- and slave-trading caravan commanded by Khurshid Agha. He hoped to make his own way after he reached Faloro. Therefore, on 26 March 1863, Baker and Florence left Gondokoro on the first leg of what proved to be an arduous two-year journey through some of east Africa's more remote areas.<br>
<br>After reaching the country of the Latuka and neighbouring Madi, east of Gondokoro, there was a delay of eleven months because of the onset of the rainy season and the refusal of local slave traders to give Baker the provisions necessary for him to continue his southward march. During this period he visited Latom&eacute;, where he suppressed a mutiny by his porters, and Tirangol&eacute;, the capital of Lutuka country. By the end of 1863 Baker and Florence had not moved beyond Obbo, which was only about 150 miles from Gondokoro. Finally, on 3 January 1864, they persuaded Ibrahim, a freebooter who worked for Khurshid Agha, to turn the caravan southwards to Bunyoro. Baker arrived at the White Nile on 22 January 1864, marched east to Karuma Falls the following day, and then crossed into the kingdom of Bunyoro.<br>
<br>Once again further travel became difficult as Kamrasi, the king (<i>omukama</i>) of Bunyoro, kept his visitors in the capital, Kisuna, for several weeks under virtual house arrest. After depleting Baker's caravan of numerous &#145;gifts&#146;, the king announced that he wanted to exchange several of his wives for Florence. Baker responded to this outrage by threatening to shoot him if he persisted in making advances toward her. Shortly afterwards Kamrasi grudgingly gave his permission for the couple to leave his kingdom. In late February 1864 they left with a 300-man escort provided by Kamrasi and made their way along the right bank of the Kafa River. The march was especially demanding as Florence was in a coma caused by sunstroke. Nevertheless, on 14 March 1864, the determined couple reached Mbakovia, a village on the south-eastern shore of Luta N'zig&eacute;. For the next thirteen days they travelled in a north-easterly direction along the lake's shore before reaching Magungo, the entrance of the Victoria Nile. Owing to unsettled conditions in Madi and Koshi districts, Baker cancelled plans to travel by boat from Fashoro northwards to trace the White Nile; instead, he went east along the Victoria Nile until he came upon the falls which he named after his friend Sir Roderick Murchison. He also gave Luta N'zig&eacute; the appellation Albert Nyanza, after Prince Albert, Victoria's consort. Baker remained for two months at Patooan Island, suffering from fever. King Kamrasi, who was being threatened by a neighbour, Chief Rionga, eventually arranged for fifty of his men to transport Baker and Florence to Kisuna. For the next few months the king detained the couple, repeatedly asking for more gifts and help against Rionga. On 17 November 1864 Baker finally started his return journey north, arriving in Gondokoro on 15 March 1865 and in Khartoum on 5 May 1865. After spending almost two months in the Sudanese capital he left for England on 1 July 1865, via Berber, Suakin, Cairo, Alexandria, Marseilles, and Paris. On arrival in England on 14 October 1865 Baker finalized arrangements for his marriage to Florence, which took place on 4 November 1865.<h2>
<a name="Recognitionandrewards"></a>Recognition and rewards</h2>The discovery of the Albert Nyanza marked the pinnacle of Baker's career as an African explorer in so far as it helped to resolve the mystery of the source of the Nile. Soon after his return to England in 1865 he learned that he had been awarded the Royal Geographical Society's prestigious gold medal for his work in Africa. Numerous other awards soon followed. In August 1866 Baker received a knighthood; in the same year he became an honorary MA of Cambridge, and also published his account of the expedition, entitled <span class="italic">The Albert Ny'anza, Great Basin of the Nile, and Explorations of the Nile Sources</span>. The work, which went through several editions, remains one of the most important narratives of African exploration during the Victorian era. In 1867 the Paris Geographical Society conferred on him its <i>grande m&eacute;daille d'or</i>, and on 3 June 1869 he was elected FRS. He also became an honorary member of the geographical societies of Paris, Berlin, Italy, and the United States.<br>
<br>For the next few years Baker and his wife lived at Hedenham Hall, Norfolk. It was at this manor house that he wrote <span class="italic">The Nile Tributaries of Abyssinia, and the Sword Hunters of the Hamran Arabs</span>, and a boys' adventure story, <span class="italic">Cast up by the Sea</span>, which were published in 1867 and 1868 respectively.<h2>
<a name="GoverningtheNilebasin18691873"></a>Governing the Nile basin, 1869&#150;1873</h2>In 1869 the prince of Wales invited Baker to accompany him on his visit to Egypt and journey up the Nile, despite the disapproval of Queen Victoria. The same year, on 1 April, the Khedive Isma&#145;il appointed Baker to a four-year term as governor-general of the equatorial Nile basin, with the rank of pasha and major-general in the Ottoman army. It was the most senior post a European ever received under an Egyptian administration. According to the khedive's firman, Baker's duties included annexing the equatorial Nile basin, establishing Egyptian authority over the region south of Gondokoro, suppressing the slave trade, introducing cotton cultivation, organizing a network of trading stations throughout the annexed territories, and opening the great lakes near the equator to navigation. To carry out the mission, the khedive provided Baker with a flotilla of ten steamers and fifty-five sailing ships, and about 1700 officers and men. On 5 December 1869 he and Lady Baker departed Cairo for Suakin; a month later they were in Khartoum. However, because of unfavourable conditions on the Nile and an inability to penetrate the sudd it was not until April 1871 that the party arrived in Gondokoro. On 26 May 1871 Baker annexed Gondokoro&#151;which he renamed Isma&#145;iliyyah&#151;and the surrounding country in the name of the khedive. The local Bari people, however, refused to recognize Egyptian authority. After seizing some of their cattle to feed his men, Baker had to defend his expedition against attacks by the Bari. On 22 January 1872 Baker left a garrison of troops at Gondokoro to prevent a resurgence of Bari hostility and started on a southward journey with 212 officers and men. When he reached Fatick, a village north of the Victoria Nile and the Bunyoro frontier, Baker had to contend with yet another crisis. The local Arab community opposed his efforts to establish Egyptian authority and to end the slave trade. However, unlike the situation in Gondokoro, where the Bari had formed an alliance with the Arab traders, the Acholi looked upon the Fatick Arabs as enemies. As a result, they welcomed Baker's expedition and placed themselves under its protection. On 14 May 1872 while at Masindi&#151;which became the Bunyoro capital after the death of Kamrasi Baker declared that the kingdom was under Egyptian protection. This development forced the hand of Abou Saood, a local slave and ivory trader. He perceived Baker's action as a threat to his commercial interests and therefore encouraged the Bunyoro king, Kabarega, to attack Baker's men. On 14 June 1872 Baker withdrew to Fatick, where he clashed with Abou Saood's irregulars. He easily defeated the slave trader's retainers, many of whom subsequently deserted and joined Baker's entourage. With their help Baker built a fort at Fatick which represented the southernmost outpost of Egyptian influence in eastern Africa. The expedition produced mixed results. Although he had suppressed the slave trade in some areas and had extended the khedive's authority to Gondokoro and Fatick, he had failed to pacify the lawless region between these two places. Moreover, he was unable to annex the wealthy kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda. Despite Baker's dubious performance, the khedive bestowed on him the imperial order of the Osmanieh, second class.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandreputation"></a>Retirement and reputation</h2>Baker received a hero's welcome on his return to England. Apart from various glowing newspaper accounts of his travels, the prince of Wales met him to learn first hand of his experiences in Africa. On 8 December 1873 he received an enthusiastic reception at the Royal Geographical Society, and the following year he published a two-volume account of his expedition entitled <span class="italic">Ismail&iuml;a: a narrative of the expedition to central Africa for the suppression of the slave trade</span>, which further enhanced his popularity.<br>
<br>Baker and his wife eventually moved into Sandford Orleigh, Highweek, a forty-room mansion in south Devon, near Newton Abbot. This estate remained Baker's home for the rest of his life. He regularly wrote books and newspaper and magazine articles about a variety of political and sporting subjects. Additionally, he was elected president of the Devonshire Association, and served as a town councillor in Newton Abbot. Every autumn he undertook a hunting expedition to Scotland, or travelled abroad: in 1879, for example, Baker spent nearly a year in Cyprus; between 1879 and 1892 he visited India seven times, killing a total of twenty-two tigers. There were other hunting expeditions to Japan, to the Rocky Mountains, and to virtually every European country. The Bakers also visited Egypt regularly and, in the late 1870s, made a protracted round-the-world voyage. Baker died of a heart attack at Sandford Orleigh on 30 December 1893. His body was cremated and his ashes buried at Grimley, near Worcester, on 5 January 1894. He was survived by his second wife, and by three daughters of the seven children of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Sir Samuel Baker was typical of many Victorian explorers and adventurers in as much as he was a strong-willed, unconventional, intolerant, and self-reliant individual, often insensitive to social norms and to those around him. Post-colonial scholars have emphasized Baker's deep-seated contempt for non-European peoples and cultures, a facet of his personality and career that has been profoundly unattractive to posterity. But it is important not to see Baker as exceptional in this regard: in his own time, the idealization of British civilization and the refusal to acknowledge any worth in non-European societies were commonplace. Moreover, this emphasis tends to overlook Baker's genuine concerns for the welfare of the people of Africa as evinced in his suppression of the slave trade along the White Nile. Despite his personal shortcomings, Baker's reputation as one of the most important British explorers of the nineteenth century is assured.<br>
