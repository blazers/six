<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Monkman,  Kenneth Mackay</span>  (1911&#150;1998), <span class="occ">book collector and restorer of Shandy Hall, Coxwold</span>, was born on 17 April 1911 at 215 Warwick Road, Carlisle, the son of Wilfred Monkman (1879&#150;1949), bank inspector, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackay (1881&#150;1962). The family soon moved to Harrogate, and Monkman always prided himself on being a north Yorkshireman. He was educated at Rydal School (now Rydal Penrhos), Colwyn Bay, north Wales, and read for a chemistry degree at the University of Leeds. As was later noted, he was &#145;not entirely engrossed by the course, during which he wrote the words for &#145;It's the Rhythm&#146;, a popular song set to music by Bill Williamson&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 March 1998). This early distraction perhaps presages Monkman's discovery of a kindred spirit in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26412/', "Laurence Sterne (1713&#150;1768)")</script>, the English prose master of digressive paths. According to Nicolas Barker, writing in <span class="italic">The Independent</span> (26 March 1998), it was the painter Francis Butterfield who first introduced Monkman to <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>, soon after Monkman left university without his degree.<br>
<br>Digressing again, he spent his working life in journalism, at the outset with Yorkshire newspapers and later, from 1942 to 1971, as a copywriter for the overseas service of the BBC. Whether this was vocation or avocation is difficult to assess, but from his first days in London to the end of his life he was dominated by his &#145;delicious and purposeful obsession&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 March 1998). His fellow antiquarian W. G. Day described how Monkman &#145;chose to work weekends &hellip; so that he could take time off in lieu during the week &hellip; trawling the bookshops of London &hellip; searching for books by and about Sterne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shandean</span>, 10, 1998, 10). While Laurence Sterne was always admired in Europe and America, his reputation in England in this period was typified by F. R. Leavis's footnote, summarizing his work as &#145;irresponsible (and nasty) trifling&#146;  (Leavis, 2, n.2). Monkman swam against the tide in his admiration of Sterne, but brought many others to follow in his wake. On 31 July 1945, at Westminster register office, he married Vita Duncombe Mann, with whom he had a son, Francis, in 1949 (named, perhaps, in honour of the person who introduced him to Sterne's writings); the couple later separated and eventually divorced in 1965.<br>
<br>Monkman's extensive library&#151;along with an equally large collection of other eighteenth-century authors, journals, pamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers&#151;came to fill his London house to capacity. It was to find a permanent home at Shandy Hall, Sterne's residence in Coxwold, Yorkshire, between 1760 and 1768. Monkman first visited the hall in 1963, finding it to be a derelict building, much without improvement since Sterne's residency. Monkman now dedicated himself to its restoration, accompanied by his partner, Julia Gladys Ernestine Bearder (<i>b</i>. 1931), whom he married at Kensington register office on 5 February 1965. Together they created not only a repository for the collection, but also &#145;the most beautiful of &hellip; literary places of pilgrimage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 March 1998). Enlisting the worldwide support of Sterne enthusiasts, Monkman established the Laurence Sterne Trust in 1967 and raised funds for the restoration effort, undeterred by the judgement of the Ministry of Works that the project was quixotic. With the perseverance that marked his activity as a collector and bibliographer he completed the restoration three years later, and the Monkmans, their two sons, and the incomparable collection relocated to Shandy Hall.<br>
<br>One of the first to profit from the collection was Melvyn New, editor of the Florida edition of the works of Sterne, who spent the summer of 1971 in close consultation with Monkman and his multiple copies of each of the nine volumes of <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> (1759&#150;67). When the edition appeared in 1978 Monkman supplied the detailed bibliographical descriptions in appendix 5. His earlier essay on editions of <span class="italic">Tristram</span> (<span class="italic">The Library</span>, 25, 1970, 11&#150;39) was an invaluable contribution, as was his first foray into attribution, an essay in 1971 (Cash and Stedmond, <span class="italic">Winged Skull</span>, 112&#150;23), arguing that an article signed &#145;Hamlet&#146;, published in a York newspaper in 1747, was Sterne's; it has been accepted into Sterne's canon by the Florida editors.<br>
<br>Monkman published further bibliographical work on Dublin editions of <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span> in 1979 and on Sterne's sermons in 1993. Ten years earlier he made a notable addition to Sterne's biography: the discovery and publication of an annotated text of the lost portion of the manuscript of the &#145;Memoir&#146;, written by Sterne for his daughter Lydia. It was not until 1989, however, that his scholarly efforts toward amplifying the Sterne canon found an outlet. In that year, with Monkman's encouragement, Peter de Voogd established the annual journal <span class="italic">The Shandean</span>, dedicated to scholarship on Sterne. For Monkman this very attractive publication became the forum in which finally to reveal the extent of his holdings, for having collected broadsides, pamphlets, and newspapers for forty years, he was determined to find Sterne's pen in many places. In particular, following the cue of Lewis Perry Curtis, who had written in 1929 on Sterne's possible political writings in the 1740s, Monkman was convinced he could augment Curtis's study. In a series of essays beginning in 1989 with a fifty-six page piece in <span class="italic">The Shandean</span>, volume 1, &#145;More of Sterne's politicks 1741&#150;1742&#146;&#151;followed by &#145;Sterne and the '45&#146; (1990) and &#145;Sterne's farewell to politics&#146; (1991)&#151;he made his case for some fifty additions to the canon.<br>
<br>Monkman remained a prolific contributor to <span class="italic">The Shandean</span>, with essays divided between attributions and the first publication of newly discovered letters in his possession. The 1998 volume, which contains Day's commemorative comments, includes the last two pieces written by Monkman. The first, &#145;The skull&#146;, is a fascinating account (concluded by Day) of his search for Sterne's buried skeleton in London and its removal to Coxwold's St Michael's Church, directly across the road from Shandy Hall, for reburial in June 1969. The second, an essay that shows Monkman at his best, is &#145;Shandean race horses&#146;, a wonderful account of the &#145;race horses in the 1760's named after Sterne's characters&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Shandean</span>, 10, 1998, 21&#150;7). One can be positive that so hobby-horsical an enterprise gave him the greatest of pleasures.<br>
<br>Regrettably Monkman's attributions have not been widely accepted by the scholarly community. The Florida editors of the <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (2014), where his findings have their logical place, put the problem as diplomatically as possible:<blockquote>One of the painful aspects of organizing this edition was the need to reject almost all the attributions of Kenneth Monkman, a dedicated Sternean to whom all eighteenth-century scholars owe much. Up to his death, Kenneth supported the Florida edition, despite his wariness toward scholars in general, American scholars in particular. (Sterne, 9.xi&#150;xii)</blockquote>They also add the hope that with new discoveries, especially of lost copies of the <span class="italic">York Gazetteer</span>, Monkman's attributions can definitively be vindicated.<br>
<br>Kenneth and Julia Monkman's restoration of Shandy Hall created one of the most delightful authorial shrines in England. Although Coxwold is not easily accessible it became a necessary stop for Sterne scholars and eighteenth-century aficionados during the Monkmans' residence for nearly thirty years. The hall's honorary curator from 1970, and a true enthusiast, Monkman could wax equally eloquent about a variant comma or Sterne's influence on James Joyce. Disputes between host and visitor, as could happen often, were soothed by a walk in the hall's gardens, which were beautifully restored by Julia. Kenneth Monkman resided at Shandy Hall until his death, from congestive cardiac failure, on 22 March 1998 at Friarage Hospital, Northallerton. Fittingly, he was buried at the foot of Sterne's grave, in St Michael's churchyard, Coxwold. He was survived by Julia, who served as curator until her retirement in 2004. Shandy Hall remains the home of Monkman's collection and the location for exhibitions, talks, and education projects run by the Laurence Sterne Trust.<br>
