<span class="headword">Harrop,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1727, <em>d.</em> 1804), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and printer</span>, was baptized on 1 October 1727 at Manchester Cathedral, the second of the eight children of James Harrop (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1754), joiner, of Manchester, and his wife, Sarah Dickons (<i>d</i>. 1763). He was admitted to Manchester grammar school on 15 November 1736 and later served an apprenticeship with Robert Whitworth, proprietor and publisher of the <span class="italic">Manchester Magazine</span>. On 11 April 1749 he married Ellen Williamson (<i>c</i>.1727&#150;1772) at Manchester Cathedral; they had one child, Harrop's successor, James. Ellen died from consumption on 12 January 1772. Two years later, on 5 July 1774, Harrop married, as his second wife, Mary Bury (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1801), daughter of John Bury (<i>d</i>. 1785), brewer and timber merchant of Salford, and his wife, Frances Hanford (<i>d</i>. 1788), at St Anne's, Soho. The couple had six children: Frances, John Bury, Sarah Ann, Mary, William Bury, and Joseph; only the two youngest daughters survived into adulthood. Their mother died from dropsy on Christmas day 1801.<br>
<br>Whitworth's whig-orientated <span class="italic">Manchester Magazine</span> had enjoyed a monopoly in Manchester for several years. In 1752, however, with the assistance of the Revd John Clayton and others, Harrop established a formidable rival. The first number of <span class="italic">Harrop's Manchester Mercury</span> was issued on 3 March 1752. With the ninth number the title changed to <span class="italic">Harrop's Manchester Mercury and General Advertiser</span>; later it was called the <span class="italic">Manchester Mercury and Harrop's General Advertiser</span>. Published every Tuesday&#151;Manchester's main market day&#151;at the sign of the printing press, opposite the exchange, the <span class="italic">Mercury</span> was to become the longest-running venture of its type in the eighteenth century. The final number, 3672, was issued on 28 December 1830, seventy-eight years after its first publication. A loyal and patriotic paper, advocating tory politics, it supported the government during the period of the American War of Independence. Occasionally Harrop issued supplementary sheets containing war news, noted for their &#145;expressiveness&#146; of language  (Swindells, &#145;Harrop's &#147;Manchester Mercury&#148;&#146;, 201). The popularity of Harrop's paper owed much to his individual enterprise. By meeting the mail at Derby he brought London and foreign news express to Manchester, thereby increasing circulation. He also published various weekly instalments, most notably a <span class="italic">New History of England</span>, which extended to 778 pages, at a personal cost of 100 guineas.<br>
<br>Harrop was the most prolific Manchester printer and publisher of his day, producing numerous books, tracts, sermons, and bills. He also sold books and patent medicines. Among his most famous imprints are the large paper copies of John Byrom's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1773) and Elizabeth Raffald's <span class="italic">The Experienced English Housekeeper</span> (1769). He retired from business in 1788 in favour of his son James, although he did serve as borough reeve of Salford in 1792. Harrop died at his home, 1 Bury Street, Salford, on Friday morning, 20 January 1804. The <span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span> (24 January 1804) paid tribute to its former proprietor, a man &#145;highly esteemed among an extensive circle of acquaintance&#146;. He was buried, with his first and second wives, at St John's churchyard, Byrom Street, Deansgate, Manchester, on 23 January 1804. Harrop's will included cash bequests in excess of &pound;8000; his son James inherited the remainder of the estate. Chetham's Library, Manchester, holds a selection of correspondence relating to the <span class="italic">Manchester Mercury</span>.<br>
