<span class="headword">Thomas,  Richard Darton</span>  (1777&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Charles Thomas, was born at Saltash, Cornwall. He entered the navy in May 1790 on the <i>Cumberland</i> with Captain John Macbride. Afterwards he was in the <i>Blanche</i> in the West Indies, and when she was paid off in June 1792 he joined the sloop <i>Nautilus</i>, in which he went to the West Indies, and was at the capture of Tobago, Martinique, and St Lucia. At Martinique he commanded a flat-bottomed boat in the brilliant attack upon Fort Royal. He returned to England in the <i>Boyne</i>, and he was still with her when she was burnt at Spithead, off Portsmouth, on 1 May 1795. He was afterwards in the <i>Glory</i> and <i>Commerce de Marseille</i> in the English Channel, and in the <i>Barfleur</i> and <i>Victory</i> in the Mediterranean, and on 15 January 1797 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Excellent</i>, in which, on 14 February, he was present in the battle of Cape St Vincent, off the coast of Portugal. He continued in the <i>Excellent</i> off Cadiz until June 1798, when he was moved to the <i>Thalia</i>. In February 1799 he was transferred to the <i>Defence</i>, in December to the <i>Triumph</i>, and in October 1801 to the <i>Barfleur</i>, Collingwood's flagship in the channel. During the peace he was in the <i>Leander</i> on the Halifax station, and was promoted commander on 18 January 1803. The packet <i>Lady Hobart</i>, in which he took a passage for England, was wrecked on an iceberg. After seven days in a small boat he and his companions reached Cove Island, north of St John's, Newfoundland. On his arrival in England he was appointed, in December 1803, to the bomb-vessel <i>Etna</i>, which he took out to the Mediterranean. On 22 October 1805 he was posted to the <i>Bellerophon</i> (74 guns), from which he was moved to the <i>Queen</i> (98 guns) as flag captain to Lord Collingwood, with whom, in the <i>Ocean</i> (98 guns) and the <i>Ville de Paris</i> (110 guns), he continued until Collingwood's death in March 1810. He remained in the <i>Ville de Paris</i> until December, and in February 1811 he was appointed to the <i>Undaunted</i> (38 guns), in which he assisted the Spanish along the coast of Catalonia. In February 1813, after nine years' continuous service in the Mediterranean, he was obliged by ill health to return to England.<br>
<br>From 1822 until 1825 Thomas was captain of the Ordinary at Portsmouth, and he was in the same capacity at Plymouth from 1834 until 1837. He married, on 2 October 1827, Gratina, daughter of Lieutenant-General Robert Williams of the Royal Marines; they had a son and a daughter. Thomas became rear-admiral on 10 January 1837, and was commander-in-chief in the Pacific from 1841 until 1844, a troubled period. He was involved in obtaining compensation for British residents of San Salvador and Costa Rica, events at Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands, and the detention of a Peruvian squadron until redress was made to British subjects. His conduct was commended by the British government. He was thanked by the American government for helping Americans resident in the Sandwich Islands, and was made an honorary member of the American protestant missionary organization, the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He was promoted vice-admiral on 8 January 1848 and admiral on 11 September 1854, and he died at Stonehouse, Devonport, Plymouth, on 21 August 1857. That Collingwood kept him as his flag captain for five years is the highest testimony to Thomas's seamanship, professionalism, and personal qualities.<br>
