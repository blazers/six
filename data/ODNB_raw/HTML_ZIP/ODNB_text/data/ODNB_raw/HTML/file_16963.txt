<span class="headword">Long,  Charles Edward</span>  (1796&#150;1861), <span class="occ">genealogist and antiquary</span>, born on 28 July 1796 at Benham Park, Berkshire, was the elder and only surviving son of Charles Beckford Long (<i>d</i>. 1836) of Langley Hall in the same county and his wife, Frances Monro, daughter and heir of Lucius Tucker of Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16964/', "Edward Long (1734&#150;1813)")</script>, the historian of Jamaica, was his grandfather. Long was educated at Harrow School (1810&#150;14) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1815&#150;19), where he gained a declamation prize. In July 1818 he won the chancellor's gold medal for English verse on the subject of imperial and papal Rome. He graduated BA in 1819 and MA in 1822. Possessed of an ample fortune, Long devoted himself to historical and genealogical studies, which were greatly facilitated by the access to the College of Heralds granted him by his uncle by marriage Lord Henry Molyneux Howard, deputy earl marshal.<br>
<br>Long always maintained a personal and scholarly interest in Harrow and materially assisted George Butler in his biographical notes to the lists of Harrow scholars (1849). In 1860 he wrote on the life of John Lyon (1514&#150;1592), the founder of the school, for the <span class="italic">Harrow Gazette</span>. Long also took a considerable interest in the history of Wiltshire: he was an earnest promoter of the archaeological society for that county, and contributed to its magazine. During many years he was a frequent correspondent of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and the leading antiquarian periodicals of his day.<br>
<br>In 1845 with the assistance of Sir Charles George Young, Garter king of arms, Long compiled a volume called <span class="italic">Royal descents: a genealogical list of the several persons entitled to quarter the arms of the royal houses of England</span>. In 1859 he edited for the Camden Society, from the original manuscript in the British Museum, the <span class="italic">Diary of the Marches of the Royal Army during the Great Civil War, Kept by Richard Symonds</span>. Long also made &#145;Genealogical collections of Jamaica families&#146;, which he presented to the British Museum (now Add. MS 27968). During 1857&#150;9 he gave to the museum many valuable documents relating to Jamaica, and his letters to Joseph Hunter (1783&#150;1861), extending from 1847 to 1859, are also preserved in the British Library.<br>
<br>Of Long's other publications, two may be mentioned. First, his pamphlet of 1832 in which he defends the conduct of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16974/', "Robert Ballard Long (1771&#150;1825)")</script> during the campaign of 1811; and, second, his volume <span class="italic">Considerations on the Game Laws</span> (1824; 2nd edn, 1825) in which he offered a robust and thoughtful argument for regarding game as property, thereby allowing the sale of game to become a legal transaction.<br>
<br>Long died unmarried on 25 September 1861 at the Lord Warden Hotel, Dover, on his return from a visit to Hamburg. He was buried at Seale churchyard in Surrey.<br>
