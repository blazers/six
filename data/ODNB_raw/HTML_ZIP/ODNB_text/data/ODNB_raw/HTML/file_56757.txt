<span class="headword">Glynn,  Prudence Loveday</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Prudence Loveday Hennessy, Lady Windlesham]</span>  (1935&#150;1986), <span class="occ">fashion writer</span>, was born on 22 January 1935 at 34 Evelyn Gardens, Kensington, London, the youngest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Trevor Wallace Glynn, a retired Royal Artillery officer, of Poplar Farm House, Cold Ash, Newbury, Berkshire, and his wife, Evelyn Margaret Vernet. She grew up in Tetsworth, and was educated at Downe House, Berkshire, leaving school for a job in advertising. After working for Frank Usher, the dress company, she turned to writing for women's magazines, and became fashion editor of <span class="italic">Women's Mirror</span>. On 22 May 1965 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/102823/', "David James George Hennessy, third Baron Windlesham (1932&#150;2010)")</script>, Conservative politician and later managing director of the ATV television network: they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1966 Prudence Glynn was appointed the first fashion editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a post she held until 1980. The editor, Sir William Haley, wanted to change the image of the paper, and appointed a women's editor, Susanne Puddefoot, to introduce a daily women's page. She recruited Prudence Glynn, whose first article launched the new women's page on 3 May 1966, the first time in the history of <span class="italic">The Times</span> that news appeared on the front page. After the new editor William Rees-Mogg introduced personal bylines in 1967, she became very well known. Her articles were stylish and witty, though some felt they were too witty, and made fun of the serious world of fashion. She championed British designers, including Jean Muir, and after attending his first fashion show in 1966 was instrumental in the rise to fame of the pop designer Ossie Clark (1942&#150;1996), whom she regarded as one of the most talented fashion designers ever produced in Britain: she chose his chiffon and satin trouser suit as the 1968 dress of the year for the Museum of Costume in Bath. Glynn was passionate about British fashion, and she crusaded through her articles to raise it to the level of French fashion; this led to government initiatives to promote the manufacture and export of British designs. She enjoyed the glamour of the fashion scene, and the power that she wielded at the height of her influence as a <i>grande dame</i> of fashion. Highly respected as a fashion journalist, she was regarded as authoritative because she wrote for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and to be mentioned by her was of enormous importance to designers. She was an excellent journalist, writing beautifully and at length, and it was a standing joke that her sentences were even longer than those of her fellow journalist Bernard Levin. Many people read her articles not because they were interested in fashion, but because they were fun to read. But she found it hard to get on with her female colleagues at <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and after several difficult years from the mid-1970s onwards she was removed from the post of fashion editor, and given a weekly column. Her first piece, on 16 October 1980, was &#145;Fourteen years and positively no regrets&#146;.<br>
<br>Glynn published two books, both lavishly illustrated. <span class="italic">In Fashion: Dress in the Twentieth Century</span> (1978), a social history of fashion, puts the work of designers into the context of their times, and traces the ways in which fashion reflects society. It is full of witty observations, such as her comment on the contradiction involved in buying a pair of blue jeans by Yves St Laurent: &#145;that is one problem of wearing pioneer dress in the richest country in the world&#146;  (p. 59). The book covers sporting fashion, royal fashion, theatrical fashion, and utility clothes, as well as <i>haute couture</i>. <span class="italic">Skin to Skin: Eroticism in Dress</span> (1982) begins by asking why people wear clothes at all, and agrees with Robert Burton that &#145;The greatest provocations of our lust are from our apparel&#146;. Recalling that Hardy Amies once told her that the most erotic sight he ever saw was nuns playing tennis, making the point that sexual excitement can be caused as much by concealment as by revelation, she concludes that &#145;Eros, god of love, depends from every coathanger&#146;  (p. 16).<br>
<br>During the 1970s Prudence Glynn was very influential in the design world as a member of the council of the Royal College of Art from 1969 to 1977, and the Design Council from 1973 to 1979. She was also on the Council for National Academic Awards committee for art and design from 1972, and a member of the Crafts Council from 1977 to 1980. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1974.<br>
<br>Glynn was very tall, slim, and elegant, and described herself as having a face like a currant bun. In her later years she began to suffer psychiatric problems; she separated from her husband, and the quality of her journalism became uneven. She died on 24 September 1986 in the St Charles Hospital, Kensington, London.<br>
