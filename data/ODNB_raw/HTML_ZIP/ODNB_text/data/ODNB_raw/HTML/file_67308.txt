<span class="headword">Jackson,  Raymond Allen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Jak]</span>  (1927&#150;1997), <span class="occ">cartoonist and illustrator</span>, was born in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 11 March 1927, the only child of Maurice Jackson, formerly Jacobovitz (1894&#150;1960), a journeyman tailor from &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, who had lived in France and then Brighton before moving to work in London's &#145;rag-trade&#146; area around Great Titchfield Street. At first he changed his name to Jacob and then to Jackson and later set up his own ladies' tailoring shop in Kensington Mall, Notting Hill Gate. Raymond's mother was an Irishwoman, Marie (Polly) Murphy (<i>b</i>. 1904), who also worked in the clothing business. He was educated at Clipstone Road School, London, and Lyulph Stanley Central School, London. At fourteen he worked as a messenger boy in the Great Titchfield Street area before going to Willesden Technical College and School of Art (1941&#150;4), where a fellow pupil was the illustrator Peter Jackson. There he spent two years in general education before studying art full-time for a further two years, training as a student teacher. On 3 April 1945 he enlisted for the Territorial Army and served at first as a driver in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps before joining its education division (1945&#150;8). Teaching conscripts to paint, he was posted to Italy, Palestine (1945&#150;7), and Egypt (he was an instructor at the Middle East Art College, 1947&#150;8) and achieved the rank of sergeant. He then returned to Willesden Technical College (1948&#150;50) to study commercial art, graduating with a national diploma in design.<br>
<br>In 1950 Jackson joined the Link House Publishing Group (1950&#150;51) as a staff artist, retouching pubic hair on photos for <span class="italic">Health &amp; Efficiency</span>, and drawing a series of cartoons about a character called Curly. He then moved to Keymers Advertising Agency as an artist (1951&#150;2) while also contributing joke cartoons to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, and other publications. He joined the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in 1952, first in the advertising department at 11 guineas a week, then as a freelance general illustrator for the paper before moving to the art department, producing drawings for the television and sports pages, illustrations for features (signing his drawings Ray Jackson), and occasional caricatures and pocket cartoons. In October 1954 he met his wife Claudie Grenier (<i>b</i>. 1936), a French au pair from &Eacute;pernay, at the Linguists' Club in Kensington. They were married on 9 March 1957 and had three children: Dominique, Patrick, and Nathalie.<br>
<br>After the death of Vicky (Victor Weisz), Jak became the <span class="italic">Standard</span>'s political cartoonist (1966&#150;97), while also drawing for its sister paper, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, on Saturdays. When the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> was bought by Associated Newspapers in 1986, he stopped drawing for the <span class="italic">Express</span> and drew instead for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> on Saturdays and the <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span>. Altogether he worked for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> for forty-five years. In addition he contributed occasional journalism to the paper (especially travel articles with illustrations and photographs by himself in the 1960s), drew advertisements for Carling Black Label beer and others, illustrated several books including the <span class="italic">Guinness Book of Records</span>, edited by Norris and Ross McWhirter (1974), and <span class="italic">Russia Dies Laughing</span> (1982), and painted in watercolour. His own publications included thirty-one annuals of <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> cartoons from <span class="italic">The Nutty World of JAK</span> (1966).<br>
<br>Jackson admired the work of Ronald Searle, Pat Oliphant, Ralph Steadman, and (the early) Carl Giles&#151;whose detailed and realistic style influenced his own greatly. He roughed cartoons out in 2B pencil on A2 layout paper (usually six a day from which the editor chose one), and completed the drawing with a brush and mapping pen using Pelikan ink on board, tints being indicated with pale blue wash. Jak always drew hands with three fingers in the style of Disney animators and signed his name in capitals with &#145;blob&#146; serifs. In his early drawings he often included a portrait of his wife (with a pony tail) and their boxer dog, Shamus. He was a technically proficient artist, good at backgrounds and architectural details, but (like Giles), &#145;excelled at drawing types: bumbling vicars and desiccated judges; crusty clubmen with quivering moustaches; bobbies and burglars and dimwitted bruisers; vast armour-plated matrons; long-legged lovelies, top-heavy on stiletto heels&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Though he supported no political party his cartoons were sometimes controversial. One drawing&#151;&#145;Homo-Electrical-sapiens Britannicus circa 1970&#146; (9 December 1970)&#151;which criticized a work-to-rule action by power-station workers, nearly resulted in the <span class="italic">Standard</span>'s closure as a result of sympathetic industrial action by print unions. Another (&#145;The ultimate in psychopathic horror&#151;<span class="smallcap">THE IRISH</span>&#146;, 29 October 1982), caused the Labour-controlled Greater London council to stop advertising in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> as a protest.<br>
<br>Jak claimed to have been the first to break the (post-Victorian) unwritten prohibition on caricaturing the British royal family. The Labour prime minister Tony Blair called him &#145;one of the finest political cartoonists&#146; and Lord Rothermere added that he was &#145;one of the all-time greats alongside Rowlandson, Gillray and Illingworth&#146;  (foreword to <span class="italic">Jak: his Life and Work</span>). He was voted political/social cartoonist of the year three times by the Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain (1964, 1965, 1985), British Press awards cartoonist of the year (1980), and Glen Grant sports cartoonist of the year (1981) and royal cartoonist of the year (1981). Jak was a founder member of the British Cartoonists' Association in 1966 and also belonged to the Chelsea Arts Club, the Saints' and Sinners' Club, and the Special Forces' Club. Examples of his work were included in the National Portrait Gallery exhibition &#145;Drawn and quartered: the world of the British newspaper cartoon&#146; (1970) and can be found in such public collections as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Cartoon Archive at the University of Kent at Canterbury.<br>
<br>&#145;Small, wiry and as strong as an ox&#146;  (McKay and McGill, 5), Jak was 5 feet 8 inches tall, and was usually clean-shaven with prematurely thin dark brown (later grey) hair. He had brown eyes and wore thick spectacles from the age of two. At work he would always wear a butcher's apron. A judo blackbelt and a keen golfer, his motto was a variant of Disraeli's: &#145;Never explain; never complain&#146;. Raymond Jackson died at his home, 21 Seymour Road, Wimbledon, London, on 27 July 1997 following a heart operation. He was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium, London, on 1 August 1997.<br>
