<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  Clement Edward</span>  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 19 February 1884 at Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, the youngest of the seven children of Moses Davies, auctioneer, and his wife, Elizabeth Margaret Jones of Llanerfyl, Montgomeryshire. Clement Davies was sent to the local English school, but won a scholarship to Llanfyllin county school when it was founded in 1897. He went on to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a senior foundation scholar, obtained first-class honours in both parts of the law tripos (1906&#150;7), and was law student (1907&#150;11). He won prizes in criminal law, constitutional law, and the law of real property, and was awarded the bar prize and certificate of honour in the bar finals in 1909, when he was called by Lincoln's Inn. Shortly before this he had been a lecturer at Aberystwyth University College, but in 1909 he joined the north Wales circuit before transferring in 1910 to the northern circuit. In that year he moved to London and rapidly developed a successful commercial practice. He had the capacity to read quickly and accurately, once mastering twenty-five briefs in a morning. He also published works on agricultural law and the law of auctions and auctioneers.<br>
<br>In 1913 Davies married Jano Elizabeth (1881&#150;1969), daughter of Morgan Davies, a Welsh surgeon with a practice in London. She was a graduate in classics and modern languages of the University of Wales, and had studied in Paris before becoming a teacher; she was the youngest headteacher of her time in London. She was a linguist and an excellent public speaker and was to bring valuable support to her husband's political work. They had three sons and one daughter. Three of the children each died at the age of twenty-four; one son and the daughter were both accidentally killed while on active service.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Davies volunteered for military service, but was posted instead to the office of the procurator-general as adviser on enemy activities in neutral countries and on the high seas. He was later seconded to the Board of Trade's department concerned with trading with the enemy. After the war he was successively secretary to the president of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division (1918&#150;19) and to the master of the rolls (1919&#150;23). From 1919 to 1925 he was a junior counsel to the Treasury. He took silk in 1926 and in 1935 he was appointed chairman of the Montgomeryshire quarter sessions, a post that he held, and was most assiduous in filling, until his death. He gave up practice in 1930 when he joined the board of Unilever, and remained a board member until 1941, when he resigned in order to concentrate on his political work.<br>
<br>From his youth onwards Clement Davies had been fascinated by radical politics. One of his forebears had voted for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832. Politics were in the air he breathed as a young barrister when he worked as junior counsel with John Simon and F. E. Smith, both destined to become lord chancellor; and quite late in life Davies would speak of the Asquith government as though he had been in parliament at the time. But it was not until 1929 that he felt able to contest a seat and was returned at the general election as a Liberal for Montgomeryshire, which he represented for the rest of his life. He was rooted in the county of his birth and made his home there at Meifod. Inevitably, he became entangled in the party disputes which followed the formation of MacDonald's National Government in 1931. At the general election of that year he held his seat unopposed as a <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96340', "Liberal National")</script>. He did so again at the election of 1935, although by this time the Liberal Party, led by Sir Herbert Samuel, had withdrawn its support of the government and was in opposition.<br>
<br>It was in his Liberal National phase that Davies did his most valuable work as a back-bencher, serving on a number of committees, and especially as chairman of an inquiry into the incidence of tuberculosis in Wales. Between 1937 and 1938 he made the most searching inquiries and found grave inadequacies in the provision of public health services and housing. His legal training and political sense here complemented each other perfectly. His report was not published until 1939, and most of the remedies had to await the post-war period, but it nevertheless represented a landmark in the development of health administration in Wales.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the war in 1939 Clement Davies became the chairman of an action committee in the House of Commons which sought the most effective prosecution of the war and which was supported by members of the three main parties in the house. Davies was among an increasing number who had become convinced that there must be a coalition government in which all three parties should be represented, and his action group was important in mobilizing opposition to the Chamberlain government. In the critical debate on the Norwegian campaign, 7&#150;8 May 1940, it was Clement Davies who, on the second day, persuaded Lloyd George to speak&#151;a speech which Churchill described as Lloyd George's &#145;last decisive intervention in the House of Commons&#146;. The concluding vote was a moral defeat for the government, and on 10 May 1940 Churchill became prime minister. Lord Boothby, who worked closely with Davies in the action committee as its secretary, later described him as &#145;one of the architects&#151;some may judge the principal architect&#146; of the Churchill coalition government. But this assessment exaggerates Davies's importance and there was to be no place for him in the coalition, which Boothby took as proof of his own belief that Churchill &#145;did not treat his friends well&#146;  (James, 245&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1942 Davies rejoined the independent Liberal Party and, notwithstanding his Liberal National past, became its leader in 1945 in succession to Sir Archibald Sinclair, who had been defeated in Caithness and Sutherland. With Frank Byers as his chief whip, Davies planned an ambitious programme of recovery for the party after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1945. He was determined to maintain Liberal independence and dismissed as &#145;unworthy subterfuge&#146; Churchill's appeal for an electoral arrangement with the Conservatives before the general election of 1950, which the Liberals contested on a wide front  (Gilbert, 505). But in the absence of an electoral pact only nine Liberals were returned, the number falling to six in 1951, when the Liberal vote fell to a mere three-quarters of a million&#151;a performance that was barely improved upon in 1955. At the party conference the following year, Davies surprised the assembly by announcing his intention of &#145;handing over the wheel and going below&#146;  (Grimond, 188). Jo Grimond was his designated successor. Davies's difficulties had been made greater by a debilitating struggle with alcoholism, which he managed mostly to keep from public view. By 1960, though, he had made the decision not to contest the next election.<br>
<br>As leader Davies had to contend with deep divisions within Liberal ranks. The need to reconcile such disparate elements as Hopkin Morris and Lady Megan Lloyd George led him to adopt contradictory positions, and Lady Violet Bonham Carter, who ultimately held considerable affection for Davies, thought him &#145;a jelly fish who drifts on every tide &hellip; &amp; goes wherever he is pushed or pulled&#146;  (V. Bonham Carter to Gilbert Murray, 6 April 1950, Lady Asquith MSS). She was critical, too, of his decision not to seek an electoral alliance with the Conservatives when it was offered&#151;he had even refused office in Churchill's 1951 government. But by maintaining Liberal independence in the party's darkest hour he may also have ensured its future. Emlyn Hooson, who succeeded him as member for Montgomeryshire in 1962, believed that his &#145;greatest contribution was to hand over the Party to Grimond as a still recognized political entity, with all the trappings and organization of a much larger Parliamentary Party&#146;  (private information). From this basis Grimond effected a significant Liberal revival after 1956.<br>
<br>Clem Davies was a kindly man who made friends in all parties in the House of Commons. He was devoted to parliament as an institution, and his respect for it, with his awareness of the chafings of poverty, made him a sturdy advocate of a decent standard of pay for all members. Liberal organization during his leadership was not taut and he was a radical evangelist by temperament rather than a party boss, but he would spread the gospel of Liberalism anywhere with zeal. He had an agreeable voice and spoke frequently in the country, and particularly liked to talk to students at the universities. The ease with which he found himself in his public speeches developing Patrick Henry's theme &#145;Give me liberty, or give me death!&#146; almost endeared him to his critics, though some bemoaned his &#145;chapel&#146; oratory. Such causes as social reform, collective security, and world government enthused him, and towards the end of his career he found deep satisfaction in his work as president of the Parliamentary Association for World Government. He was nominated, unsuccessfully, in 1955 for a Nobel peace prize.<br>
<br>Davies was sworn of the privy council in 1947. He was elected an honorary fellow of Trinity Hall in 1950 and a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1953. In that year he received the freedom of Welshpool and in 1955 an honorary LLD from the University of Wales. He died at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, on 23 March 1962.<br>
<br>His widow, Jano Davies, survived him. She was involved in women's movements, attending the International Women's Congress in Istanbul in 1935 as a delegate. In 1939 she was a founder of the Women's Voluntary Services for Wales, and from 1941 to 1945 was a member of the commission on reconstruction for Wales. In 1947 she was appointed high sheriff of Merioneth.<br>
