<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamer,  Robert James</span>  (1911&#150;1963), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born on 31 March 1911 (along with his twin sister, Barbara) at 24 Chester Road, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the son of Owen Dylmer Hamer, a bank clerk, and his wife, Annie Grace Brickell. Both his parents survived him. He was educated at Rossall School in Lancashire, where he showed himself to be intellectually outstanding and won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He had intended to join the Treasury as an economist or mathematician but achieved only a third-class degree. Hamer later light-heartedly blamed &#145;the proximity of Newmarket Heath to Cambridge and the existence in Cambridge of five cinemas changing programmes twice weekly&#146;  (&#145;Biography of Robert Hamer&#146;) for his disappointing performance. He also spent much of his time writing poetry and contributing to revues, but he suffered a more serious disruption to his studies when he was sent down for having a homosexual affair with another student  (Drazin, <span class="italic">Finest Years</span>, 72).<h2>
<a name="EalingStudios"></a>Ealing Studios</h2>Hamer began his career in films in 1934 as a &#145;number boy&#146; and cutting-room assistant at the Gaumont-British Studios in Shepherd's Bush. A year later he joined London Films, which was expanding rapidly after the success of Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">The Private Life of Henry VIII</span> (1933). Korda attracted a number of European film-makers to Britain, including Erich Pommer, the producer of German films such as <span class="italic">The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</span> and <span class="italic">Metropolis</span>. When Pommer formed a production company with Charles Laughton&#151;Mayflower Pictures&#151;to make prestigious films designed for the international market, he asked Hamer to edit <span class="italic">Vessel of Wrath</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Jamaica Inn</span> (1939).<br>
<br>Soon after <span class="italic">Jamaica Inn</span> was completed Pommer and Laughton left for Hollywood and Mayflower's operations were suspended. As war approached, Hamer joined the General Post Office film unit alongside Alberto Cavalcanti, whose earlier work with the French avant-garde Hamer much admired. In 1940 Cavalcanti was recruited by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93789', "Ealing Studios")</script> and he was soon joined by Hamer. After editing <span class="italic">Turned out Nice Again</span> (1941), <span class="italic">Ships with Wings</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1942) Hamer worked as associate producer on <span class="italic">My Learned Friend</span> (1943), <span class="italic">San Demetrio London</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Fiddlers Three</span> (1944). He also gained some experience in directing by taking over from Charles Frend when he fell ill on <span class="italic">San Demetrio London</span> and re-shooting sequences for <span class="italic">Fiddlers Three</span> when Harry Watt, an outdoor realist director, failed to adjust to the demands of a musical comedy set in ancient Rome and starring Tommy Trinder.<br>
<br>In 1945 Hamer directed one of the episodes of the omnibus horror film <span class="italic">Dead of Night</span>. His contribution, &#145;The Haunted Mirror&#146;, though less praised at the time than Cavalcanti's &#145;The Ventriloquist's Dummy&#146;, has come to be seen as a clever allegory of sexual repression, and the disturbing presence of mirrors became a recurring motif in Hamer's films. A similar fascination with the dark side of life is apparent in <span class="italic">Pink String and Sealing Wax</span> (1946), Hamer's first feature film, where a Victorian chemist's son, in rebellion against his father's heavy-handed patriarchal domination, strays into the rougher areas of Brighton and is lured into a murder plot by a glamorous barmaid. Hamer was happy to admit that &#145;he enjoyed the melodrama but never felt happy with the domestic charm&#146;  (&#145;Biography of Robert Hamer&#146;). And it is the sequences in the film set in the world of the sensuous and alluring barmaid (Googie Withers, who had played a major role in &#145;The Haunted Mirror&#146;), which are the most impressive.<br>
<br>Hamer's next film, <span class="italic">It always Rains on Sunday</span> (1947), was an adaptation of a topical low-life novel by Arthur La Bern. Again it starred Googie Withers as a woman trapped in an unsatisfying marriage, though here the melodrama and the domestic detail are more carefully integrated. Much of the film was shot at Ealing Studios, but it manages to capture a real feeling of East End London and the film is memorable both for its authenticity in depicting life in a cramped working-class household and for the long, atmospheric sequence where the escaped convict is hunted down at night, trapped among shunting freight trains in a railway marshalling yard. Though the critic of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> dismissed it as &#145;a dreary round of squalor&#146;, other critics praised the film for its realism, and it was a popular success.<h2>
<a name="KindHeartsandCoronets"></a>Kind Hearts and Coronets</h2>Hamer shifted back in time for <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span> (1949), a black comedy about the poor relation of a noble family who is so stung by the snobbish insensitivity of his rich cousins that he determines to eliminate all who stand between himself and the dukedom. Daringly, Hamer cast Alec Guinness to play all eight of the aristocratic victims, and Dennis Price gave a masterly performance as the suavely vengeful murderer. On its initial release the film was only modestly successful and received respectful rather than ecstatic reviews, but it was one of few British films of the period to be warmly received in France and the USA. By 1959 Hamer was complaining that:<blockquote>It's flattering to make a picture which becomes a classic within ten years; it's not so flattering, however, when people get the impression it's the <i>only</i> picture you've ever made. &hellip; That picture has become a sort of yardstick for everything else I've done. Friends, especially friends, look at my other films and say &#145;good, brilliant, superb&#146; but not, of course, so &#145;good, brilliant, superb&#146; as <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span>. (Vincent, 27)</blockquote>The comedy of <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span> is of a much blacker shade than any other Ealing comedy and pessimism haunts Hamer's best films. The darkness of his vision made it difficult for him to find projects which fitted in with the cosy ethos of Ealing Studios. <span class="italic">Soho Melodrama</span>, a script he developed with Mark Benney, an ex-burglar who had become a successful reporter and novelist, was rejected because of censorship problems. Hamer's idea of casting Margaret Lockwood as Edith Thompson, who had been hanged in 1923 when her lover was found guilty of murdering her husband, was abandoned when the censors proved hostile. Another Hamer project, a dramatization of Richard Mason's novel <span class="italic">The Shadow and the Peak</span> (1949), which would have had Vivien Leigh in the starring role, was held back by Balcon as too expensive and too erotic (it was eventually filmed as <span class="italic">Passionate Summer</span>, with Virginia McKenna). In 1949 Hamer took leave from Ealing to make <span class="italic">The Spider and the Fly</span> for his old company Mayflower, now run by Aubrey Baring and Maxwell Setton. With a solid script by Robert Westerby and good performances from Eric Portman, Guy Rolfe, and Nadia Gray, it is an intelligent and interesting film, but, in contrast to the films emerging from Ealing, it shares the mood and the visual style of the bleakest of American <i>films noir</i>.<br>
<br>Hamer was still under contract to Ealing and returned to make <span class="italic">His Excellency</span> (1951), with Eric Portman as a working-class trade union leader appointed governor of a British colony with a large naval base (very like Malta or Gibraltar). Freda Bruce Lockhart, who interviewed Hamer late in 1951, when the film was being completed, discerned that it was a task &#145;for which he had little heart&#146;, and the film is unconvincing and carelessly plotted. Hamer told his interviewer that he regarded Ealing &#145;rather as if it were a family co-operative than an employer&#146; and praised &#145;Sir Michael Balcon's wisdom in giving the members of his team a free hand, subject to rational safeguards&#146;  (Bruce Lockhart, 74&#150;5). But he found it impossible to agree with Balcon on a mutually acceptable project and left Ealing for good.<h2>
<a name="Laterfilms"></a>Later films</h2>Hamer's first film on leaving Ealing&#151;<span class="italic">The Long Memory</span> (1952), produced by Hugh Stewart, who had co-edited <span class="italic">St Martin's Lane</span> (1938) with Hamer&#151;harks back to the French poetic realism of the 1930s. John Mills plays a convict released after serving twelve years in prison for a murder he did not commit and determined on vengeance against those responsible. Visually it is an extraordinary film, shot extensively on location around the Thames estuary and ending with the wounded hero chased from Tower Bridge to the mudflats beyond Gravesend by the man he is supposed to have murdered. He is saved (physically) by a canny old tramp and (emotionally) by a European refugee who has lost everything in the war. Happiness&#151;or rather the chance to live without hurting or being hurt&#151;is possible here but only among a community of outcasts.<br>
<br>Hamer was still a highly respected film director and his next film, <span class="italic">Father Brown</span> (1954), starring Alec Guinness as G. K. Chesterton's detective&#150;priest, was well received by critics and public alike. He followed it with <span class="italic">To Paris with Love</span> (1955), a light comedy. But frivolity and Technicolor did not suit Hamer and the film springs to life only in the moment of pathos when the middle-aged widower (Guinness again) realizes that his plan to marry a vivacious young French woman is an impossible pipe dream. Much better tuned to Hamer's sensibilities was his adaptation of Turgenev's <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span> (1955) for the television company Rediffusion, an intimate drama where bored, unhappy people yearn for, but are never able to achieve, happiness in love. Even within the confines of television production of a stage play, Hamer maintains visual interest and the performances he evokes from his cast&#151;Margaret Leighton, Michael Gough, Laurence Harvey, and Geoffrey Keen&#151;are superb.<br>
<br>Twice in <span class="italic">A Month in the Country</span> the despairing suitor Ratikin quotes Swinburne's lines &#145;I can't think how things can be as dreadful as they are. I suppose if I live through this I shall live to see them become worse.&#146; They had a prophetic relevance to Hamer's own life. About 1935 he had married Joan Holt, an aspiring actress, whose brother Seth Holt worked as an editor and director at Ealing. The marriage broke up in the 1950s and Hamer began a relationship with Pamela Wilcox, daughter of the producer&#150;director Herbert Wilcox, with whom he lived until six weeks before his death. She charts their joint decline into alcoholism in her autobiography, <span class="italic">Between Hell and Charing Cross</span>. Hamer's close friend the Ealing scriptwriter Diana Morgan thought that &#145;probably he would have been happier to live as a homosexual&#146;  (Drazin, <span class="italic">Finest Years</span>, 73). Apart from the fact that before homosexuality was legalized in 1967 this would have courted legal prosecution, Hamer appeared not to attach much weight to happiness. A script for an unmade film, <span class="italic">For Each the Other</span>, contained the lines by Hamer that:<blockquote>People think they have some right to be happy, and are doubly unhappy because they are not. It is only when they come to accept that the natural human salary is one of unhappiness, and that interims of happiness come as a bonus and must be hungrily seized and savoured, that they have a chance of coming out anywhere near even in the unequal contest with fate. (Kemp, 78)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>It was not until 1958 that Hamer returned to the cinema. At Michael Balcon's suggestion he was taken on to direct an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's <span class="italic">The Scapegoat</span> (1957). This was a big-budget production backed by MGM and its story of a bored Englishman tricked into assuming the life of his aristocratic French <i>doppelg&auml;nger</i> (with Guinness in both parts), seemed ideal for Hamer. The first half of the film is intriguing and atmospheric, but it then becomes increasingly haphazard and disjointed and makes poor use of the talents of its three leading actresses: Bette Davis, Irene Worth, and Pamela Brown. This seems to have been more the fault of MGM, who would have preferred George Cukor or Vincente Minnelli as director and insisted on drastically recutting the film, than of Hamer, who stuck to his promise not to drink while he was directing the film.<br>
<br>Hamer's disappointment at the mangling of a film which would have restored his reputation seems to have destroyed any desire to reform his life. On his next and last film, <span class="italic">School for Scoundrels</span> (1960), drink got the better of him and he was replaced by Cyril Frankel after collapsing on the set. It would be unfair to attribute only the good sequences to Hamer, but it is appropriate that the first half of the film, where the hero played by Ian Carmichael is an incompetent failure at life, is much more satisfying and convincing than the second half, where, with the help of a course in &#145;lifemanship&#146;, he learns how to manipulate the world to his advantage. This was something Hamer himself conspicuously failed to do. He was declared bankrupt in November 1961 and although he completed and sold a script (<span class="italic">Down among the Dead Men</span>) and worked for a few weeks rewriting David Niven's dialogue for <span class="italic">55 Days in Peking</span> (1963), he was unable to overcome his addiction to alcohol and died of pneumonia on 4 December 1963 at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, London. He was buried at Llandegley church, Radnorshire. Hamer's contribution to British cinema is a significant one, most obviously for the wit and charm of <span class="italic">Kind Hearts and Coronets</span> and <span class="italic">Father Brown</span>, but equally for the impressive poetic realism of <span class="italic">It always Rains on Sunday</span> and <span class="italic">The Long Memory</span>, which showed he had the emotional range, the humanity, and the visual imagination to have been one of the world's great film-makers.<br>
