<span class="headword">Maglorius</span> <span class="st"> [St Maglorius]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 6th cent.), <span class="occ">ascetic</span>, is commemorated on 24 October. There is, however, no contemporary or near-contemporary evidence for his existence. According to his life, he was born in south Wales, to parents named Afrella and Umbrafel and was educated at Illtud's monastery of Llantwit Major. The life also claims that he was the cousin of St Samson; a different tradition makes him cousin of St Malo (Machutus). He was reputed to have been consecrated deacon by Samson, and to have accompanied the latter when he left Britain for Brittany. Maglorius's life asserts that Samson, dying, appointed Maglorius to succeed him as &#145;archbishop&#146; of Dol but that the saint soon thereafter resigned the office and retreated to a remote monastery, which seems to have been on the island of Sark. He died on Sark and a post-mortem cult subsequently developed there. Maglorius's relics are known to have been translated to L&eacute;hon, near Dol, in the middle of the ninth century, and to have been transferred to Paris at the time of the viking invasions of Brittany <i>c</i>.920.<br>
<br>Almost everything about Maglorius is problematic. The name itself is the Latinized form of a Brittonic name, the Welsh form being Meilyr and the Breton Maeler, but the saint is not attested as such. His earliest life was written before <i>c</i>.1000, probably in Brittany in the late ninth or early tenth century. It has never been fully published; of the various manuscripts in which it survives, none contains the complete text. Its author clearly knew very little indeed about his subject. The claim that Maglorius was &#145;archbishop&#146; not bishop of Dol reflects the unsuccessful bid to secure metropolitan status for the see of Dol in the 860s, but there are grounds for doubting whether Maglorius was ever bishop of Dol at all, and whether he ever had any contact with Samson, for he is not one of the two immediate successors of Samson mentioned in that saint's early life. There is a good case for arguing that Maglorius was an ascetic on the island of Sark, and that after his remains reached L&eacute;hon, his name and cult were appropriated by the clergy at Dol in the later ninth century for their own political purposes.<br>
<br>The author of the life also wrote accounts of some of Maglorius's miracles, and a description of the translation of his remains to L&eacute;hon. These are a valuable indication of the literary culture of Carolingian Brittany, for the author shows his familiarity with Christian Latin authors and with Virgil as well as with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. An account of the relics' removal to Paris survives in a twelfth-century form. The life was rewritten in Old French, in both prose and verse, the former in 1315 and the latter in 1319, both in conjunction with the translation of the saint's remains to a new reliquary. John Tynemouth provided an epitome of the Latin life in his <span class="italic">Sanctilogium Angliae, Walliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae</span>.<br>
<br>The centre for Maglorius's cult was the church in Paris which housed his relics, originally St Barth&eacute;lemy but renamed St Magloire. From here, liturgical commemoration of his feast day (24 October) spread to a few other churches in the &Icirc;le-de-France and to places with particular links with St Magloire. His feast is also noted in a handful of late medieval English martyrologies. In Brittany, he is the patron of the churches at Mahalon in Plomodiern (Finist&egrave;re) and at Ch&acirc;telaudren (C&ocirc;tes-d'Armor). It has been suggested on philological grounds that his cult may have become confused with that of the Breton saint Meloir and/or that of the saint attested in Cornwall as Melor and in Brittany as Melar. The truth cannot, however, be established and it remains the case that there is no certain evidence of any church dedication to Maglorius nor onomastic commemoration of him anywhere in the British Isles.<br>
