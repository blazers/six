<span class="headword">Cowles <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Crawley]</span>,  (Harriet) Virginia Spencer</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Nancy Swift]</span>  (1910&#150;1983), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 24 August 1910 in Brattleboro, Vermont, USA, the second of the two children of Edward Spencer Cowles (1878&#150;1954), a New York psychiatrist, and his wife, Florence Wolcott Jaquith (1887&#150;1932), a writer and social columnist. Virginia rarely mentioned her past. Her mother, after eloping aged nineteen, divorced and moved to Boston; she was twenty-seven, with two daughters. A court awarded $60 monthly maintenance, but this was bitterly contested, and never came. Her mother survived by writing social columns for the <span class="italic">Boston Herald</span>, hand-setting each letter, her ankles swollen from standing as a compositor. From the age of eleven Cowles boarded in Massachusetts at the Waltham School for Girls, where, without other academic distinction, she was voted by her peers as the &#145;girl most likely to succeed&#146;.<br>
<br>In Manhattan, New York, during the depression, Cowles lived off earnings precariously eked from selling advertising copy and magazine subscriptions. Her mother's death in 1932 left a $2000 life insurance windfall which funded a tour of Egypt, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, Siam, China, and Japan with her sister, Mary, in 1934. She wrote an account of these journeys for William Randolph Hearst's &#145;March of events&#146; column, and later wrote <span class="italic">Men are so Friendly</span> (1938), a light-hearted Nancy Mitford-like romp under the pseudonym Nancy Swift.<br>
<br>During the period from 1932 to 1937 Cowles, usually &#145;immaculate in her American war correspondent's uniform&#146;  (Crawley, 207), which included high heels and make-up, reported from a number of front lines. Her columns appeared in Hearst's <span class="italic">Sunday Syndicate</span>, the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, and also in the British <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. The 1937 headline &#145;New York society girl sees Americans fighting in Madrid's front trenches&#146;  (Sebba, 97) conjured up a carefree, wealthy image; that its human cost was considerable never saw print. In 1935 she interviewed Mussolini in Rome, two weeks after the Abyssinian invasion. She covered both sides of the Spanish Civil War, alternately detained by a Russian general commanding republicans and arrested by Franco's nationalists. In London her dispatch (unsigned) was quoted by Lloyd George in the Commons and she met Churchill at Chartwell through her friendship with Randolph Churchill. Just returned from Prague, where she had witnessed the response to Chamberlain's Munich betrayal, she sat next to Chamberlain at dinner and answered his query, &#145;What was it like?&#146; In 1939 Cowles toured Russia to review Red Army purges; by new year she had tracked its relentless progress through sub-zero Finland. In Berlin she scooped the last peacetime report: in Paris she recorded the day of German invasion. At the age of thirty-two, crammed hurriedly into a small Hudson aeroplane in London with a surprised Harold Macmillan, on special assignment to north Africa and in civilian dress, Virginia was denied access to the front line. She appealed to General Eisenhower, who promptly cabled back: &#145;Miss Cowles can go where she likes; she is to be given every possible assistance&#146;  (Sebba, 155).<br>
<br>According to Sir Fitzroy Maclean, reporting by Cowles &#145;had a light touch &hellip; She was very ambitious, that was one of her great gifts&#151;and she was unstoppable&#146;  (Sebba, 119). Charting female journalism a decade after her death, Anne Sebba noted that for Cowles &#145;writing was a way of understanding &hellip; world events&#146;  (ibid., 103). In <span class="italic">Looking for Trouble</span> (1941), her autobiography twice reprinted in that war-torn year, Cowles wrote: &#145;I had no qualifications as a war correspondent except curiosity&#146; and, &#145;I wrote about the things I had seen and heard but did not try to interpret them&#146;  (pp. 7, 61). In 1941 she rallied support for the allied cause in the USA; during 1942&#150;3 she served as special assistant to the American ambassador to London, Gilbert Winant. Cowles wrote <span class="italic">How America is Governed</span> (1944) and then covered the Italian campaign, the liberation of Paris, and the allied invasion of Germany. Churchill, seeing her in rowdy Walthamstow stadium two days before polling day in 1945, exclaimed: &#145;What a bad omen! <i>You</i> only appear when the established regime is falling to the ground!&#146;  (Cowles, <span class="italic">Winston Churchill</span>, 335). Captain Nigel Nicolson, actively engaged in holding a pass in Tunisia in February 1943, later remarked: &#145;her appearance was doubly startling: that she should be there at all at so critical a moment; and that she was the most beautiful young woman on whom, until then, I had ever set my eyes&#146;  (Nicolson, <span class="italic">Long Life</span>, 82&#150;3). She combined objectivity with feminine charm: &#145;Even Monty adored her, and that was saying quite something!&#146;  (Nicolson, Memorial address).<br>
<br>Virginia Cowles married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51810/', "Aidan Merivale Crawley (1908&#150;1993)")</script>, son of Canon A. Stafford Crawley, on 30 July 1945. The couple had two sons and a daughter. By nature compassionate, Virginia was variously described as ferocious, very direct, and, according to Evelyn Waugh, unprincipled. Asked if he minded, Aidan Crawley said: &#145;One thing you must remember about Virginia. She isn't <i>boring</i>&#146;  (private information). Both of them took their work, but never themselves, seriously. The arrival of Virginia's appointment as OBE for brave conduct, made on 1 July 1947, went unremarked in Aidan Crawley's memoirs. Her play, <span class="italic">Love Goes to Press</span>, brightened 1946 London before chilling Manhattan in January 1947. Her work after the war included <span class="italic">No Cause for Alarm</span> (1949), answering American questions on the Labour government, and also a major biography, <span class="italic">Winston Churchill: the Era and the Man</span> (1953).<br>
<br>Virginia's regular attendance at children's cricket, active canvassing for Aidan Crawley's Labour and subsequently Conservative parliamentary seats, entertaining in Chester Square, London, and running an active farm did not impair her relentless writing schedule; nor did her research for her husband's BBC documentaries on India, the Middle East, and Africa. Eight more biographies appeared, notably <span class="italic">Edward VII and his Circle</span> (1956), <span class="italic">The Phantom Major</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Kaiser</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The Romanovs</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">The Rothschilds</span> (1973). While Rothschilds and Churchills dined with the family, she also made lifelong friends, many obscure, and often changed their lives.<br>
<br>In 1947 Virginia Cowles stated that &#145;being on English soil has a magic of its own for me&#146;  (Crawley, 217); but by 1974 the magic had run out. While she was living in Italy, France, and Spain, three last biographies appeared. She dropped her American citizenship and had no English home: allegiance to place had ended. Diagnosed with imminently terminal emphysema, Virginia was driven by her husband through the tortuous Spanish hills of her youth at her request. <i>En route</i> for Mouton on 16 September 1983, their car turned over on the flat road across Les Grandes Landes; she was killed instantly. Her husband, although seriously injured, survived. Her body was cremated in Archeron, France.<br>
