<span class="headword">Peake,  Frederick Gerard</span>  (1886&#150;1970), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 12 June 1886 at Ashtead, Surrey, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Ancell Peake DSO, of Burrough on the Hill, Leicestershire, and his wife, Grace Elizabeth Ann Fenwicke. Peake was educated first at Stubbington House, Fareham. Originally intended for the Royal Navy, he eventually entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1906 was commissioned in the Duke of Wellington's regiment. Later that year he was posted to India where he did not much enjoy the social life but studied the local languages and followed the local hunt.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWar"></a>First World War</h2>Early in 1914 Peake was seconded to the Egyptian army and posted to the 4th infantry battalion in the Sudan. On the outbreak of war he applied to rejoin his British regiment, but his request was ignored. When the Darfur rebellion broke out in 1916 he transferred to the camel company; he had been promoted captain in 1915. Though due for home leave Peake asked to go to Salonika for action against the Bulgarians. He was temporarily posted to 17 squadron, Royal Flying Corps. Although he outstayed his leave of absence he was saved from court martial by General Milne, who sent him back to Darfur with no more than a reprimand.<br>
<br>On the last lap of his journey south Peake was thrown from his camel and severely dislocated his neck. A specialist told him his case was incurable. Later, walking in the hospital gardens and unable to raise his head from his chest, Peake crashed blindly into a tree. The jolt restored his neck to normal and there were no subsequent ill effects. He had no sooner returned to his unit than he developed a liver abscess and was sent home on sick leave. On the return voyage his ship was torpedoed near Alexandria. Peake jumped overboard with a bottle of beer and a packet of sandwiches and was picked up none the worse.<br>
<br>Early in 1918 Peake was sent to Sinai to command a company of the Egyptian camel corps. In April they joined T. E. Lawrence and Sharif Feisal's Arab army at &#145;Aqabah. Lawrence's task in the final phase of the Palestine campaign was to cut off and contain the large numbers of Turks defending the Hejaz railway and garrisoning the towns from Medina to Damascus. The Egyptian camel corps provided great assistance to Lawrence's guerrilla campaign northwards. The camels' mobility over ground inaccessible to armoured cars proved invaluable on occasions. The camel corps also proved adept as sappers, developing the &#145;tulip&#146; technique for blowing up stretches of railway. Their last task before the final decisive battle of Megiddo was to cut the Dera'a&#150;Damascus railway in order to disrupt the Turkish communications and hinder their retreat. The Turkish surrender soon followed and Peake's camel company returned to Egypt.<h2>
<a name="Transjordanafterthewar"></a>Transjordan after the war</h2>Transjordan, as the land lying to the east of the River Jordan came to be called, was in chaos as the Turks hastened for home. The area had formerly been part of the Turkish province of Syria, and such administration as the Turks had previously exercised there had completely collapsed. The Arab inhabitants were warlike and intensely tribal, both nomadic and settled. The British government, recently awarded League of Nations mandates for Iraq, Transjordan, and Palestine, was determined not to be landed with the administration of Transjordan, and was particularly opposed to the involvement of British troops. Here the politicians and the generals were as one, despite the urging to the contrary by the high commissioner for Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel.<br>
<br>British involvement was limited to the provision of six &#145;representatives&#146; located at Irbid, Salt, Jerash, Kerak, and Amman, their function being wholly advisory. Amman was then no more than a village populated mainly by Circassians, and Captain C. D. Brunton began work there at the end of August 1920. In the following month Peake, then a lieutenant-colonel, joined the Palestine administration officially as district commandant, Palestine police, Galilee, but seconded for duty in Transjordan as from 12 September 1920 as inspector of gendarmerie. In fact the previous Turkish gendarmerie had disintegrated but Brunton had begun to collect a &#145;reserve force&#146; to reinforce the ordinary gendarmerie when necessary. They totalled no more than 70 to 80 men but the target was more ambitious. However, there was no money with which to pay anyone.<br>
<br>There were plenty of swords for hire, including a large number of Syrians taking refuge from the French. Although Sharif Feisal had been proclaimed king of Syria on 8 March 1920, the French, who had been given mandates in Syria and Lebanon, defeated Feisal at Maysalum on 24 July 1920 and drove him into exile. Many Syrians took refuge in Transjordan and the French complained of raids launched across the border from Transjordan.<br>
<br>To complicate matters even further, Sharif Abdullah, second son of Sharif al-Hussein of Mecca, who had proclaimed himself king of Hejaz, turned up in November 1920 at Ma&#146;an, which was then in Hejaz. With him was a force of tribesmen and former soldiers from the Turkish army, who had the proclaimed intention of restoring his brother Feisal to the Syrian throne. On 28 February 1921 Abdullah left Ma&#146;an and on 2 March he entered Amman to receive a rapturous welcome from high and low.<br>
<br>It happened that the newly appointed colonial secretary, Winston Churchill, had called a conference in Cairo on 12 March 1921 to consider Britain's role in the Middle East. Peake was one of those present. He was now commanding the reserve force because Brunton had abruptly resigned in December 1920. Peake was much senior to Brunton. He had the local rank of <i>quaim-aqam</i> (colonel) and the honorific <i>bey</i>. The future of Transjordan was among the matters discussed. Samuel, the high commissioner, wanted to link it with Palestine. The Arabs were bitterly opposed. This was principally on account of the Balfour declaration. They wanted no Jewish immigration east of the River Jordan. And there was also the problem of Sharif Abdullah, now located in Amman, his brother Feisal having been offered the throne in Iraq, which had been originally intended for Abdullah.<br>
<br>Churchill invited Abdullah to meet him in Jerusalem where he had a boisterous welcome. They met on 28, 29, and 30 March. Abdullah was persuaded to take on the governorship of Transjordan on the understanding that it would not be included in the Palestine administrative system. The Balfour declaration would not apply. The Transjordan government would not be expected to promote Jewish immigration and colonization. Churchill suggested a trial period of six months and Abdullah after some hesitation agreed. The reserve force was to be increased to one thousand men and British financial aid was promised.<h2>
<a name="FormingtheArabLegion"></a>Forming the Arab Legion</h2>Peake reorganized the gendarmerie from top to bottom. He soon found, however, that he had to serve two masters. First was the amir, with whom he got on well on the whole. Then there was the chief British representative (CBR)&#151;H. St J. Philby (1921&#150;4) and Lieutenant-Colonel H. H. F. Cox (1924&#150;39)&#151;who controlled the purse strings and much else besides. Philby was an erratic genius and Cox an administrator pure and simple. Cox did not get on well with Abdullah and neither man was easy to serve.<br>
<br>&#145;One of the first acts of the Amir on his return [from London in 1923] was to amalgamate the Reserve Force and the police, and to call it the Arab legion&#146;, wrote Peake. &#145;The present writer was appointed to command the legion, and became responsible to the Amir for public security&#146;. The Arabic title was <i>al-jaysh al-Arabi</i> (the Arab army). This was inherited from the force of Arab regulars which fought under Feisal. It was Peake who suggested the change of English title from reserve mobile force to Arab Legion. This was readily agreed by Philby. &#145;The strange thing is that nobody noticed the change&#146;, commented Peake  (Peake's autobiography).<br>
<br>There were not many British involved for many years. From 1923 to 1930 there were only two or three, including Peake, who not only founded the Arab Legion on sound lines but who also played an important part in establishing the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan. Peake was a typical British officer of the pre-1914 army, a stern disciplinarian and a stickler for military conventions. The amir promoted him major-general (<i>amir liwa</i>) in 1923 and later gave him the honorific title <i>pasha</i>. A bachelor until almost the end of his service in the Arab Legion, he followed an Edwardian lifestyle, never failing to change for dinner, which he normally ate in solitary state. He affected to believe that it behoved senior officers to appear angry, and as he flew round his extensive parish&#151;having been taught to fly at the age of forty-four&#151;he was preceded by the codewords &#145;thunder cloud&#146;. Peake's rages were legendary but he was really a kind-hearted man.<h2>
<a name="Unpopularityandresistance"></a>Unpopularity and resistance</h2>Peake's deputy was an Arab&#151;Brigadier Abdel Quadir al-Jundi. The fact that Peake was British undoubtedly led to criticism and he had some narrow escapes. Once he was kidnapped by Sheikh Mithqal al-Fayiz of the Bani Sakhr tribe and held in a barley store for two or three days before being released. Over the years, with patience and insistence on high standards, he made the Arab Legion into an effective force, but its recruits were from the villages and towns only. Peake had no use for the Bedouin who roamed the desert east of the Hejaz Railway. Nor was he under any illusion regarding his own position. In 1924, in a report to Cox, Peake wrote: &#145;It cannot be too well known that the Amir, the Government except the new Prime Minister, and the Istaqlal [Independence Party] hate the Arab Legion. Their hatred is caused by different reasons, but they all agree on one point and that is the presence of a British officer&#146;  (Ma&#146;an Abu Nowar 1.128).<br>
<br>Peake's prejudice against the Bedouin, originating in his experience of Feisal's tribal warriors in the advance to Damascus in 1918, was, to say the least, unfortunate. Although the Arab Legion established law and order in the settled areas, it could do little in the desert where the tribes acknowledged no master. In the 1920s the desert was much plagued by raids by Ibn Sa&#145;ud's fanatical wahabis (al-ikhwan, the brotherhood) who killed all males regardless of age. The Arab Legion was no match for these savage warriors although it did play some part in defeating a massive raid on 14 August 1924 which came as close as 10 miles to Amman. It was chiefly defeated by the Bani Sakhr and other tribes in co-operation with the RAF planes and armoured cars, but the Arab Legion was also involved and had 21 killed. In 1926 Lord Plumer, high commissioner in Palestine and Transjordan, disbanded the Palestine gendarmerie and reduced the British garrison in Palestine. At the same time he reduced the Arab Legion from 1472 officers and men to 855 and abolished the artillery troop, machine gun platoon, and wireless section of the signals platoon. The Arab Legion became a police force pure and simple.<h2>
<a name="ThetransformationoftheArabLegionandtheTJFF"></a>The transformation of the Arab Legion and the TJFF</h2>In its place Plumer formed the Transjordan frontier force (TJFF), an &#145;imperial&#146; force, recruited mostly in Palestine and commanded and led by British officers. The TJFF was to be responsible for the defence of Transjordan in co-operation with the RAF. This was strongly opposed by the Amir Abdullah who had hoped the Arab Legion would be transformed into a proper military force. However, it would appear that Peake welcomed the new arrangement, in which he had no place. &#145;The defences of the country were strengthened by the formation of the TJFF&#146;, he wrote. Transjordan was to find a sixth of the new force's cost, and its main base was to be Zarqa, not far from Amman. Peake's support for the TJFF neither brought about good relations with the amir, nor added to his popularity in the Arab Legion.<br>
<br>The TJFF proved to be extremely successful in preventing Transjordan Bedouin from raiding Saudi Arabia and recouping the camels lifted by the Saudis, but it was hopeless in preventing the Saudi raiders from raiding the Transjordan tribes&#151;so much so that the Transjordan Bedouin assumed their government was operating against them. Conditions were so bad in 1927&#150;30 that Captain John Bagot Glubb, who had been very successful in pacifying the southern desert in Iraq, was invited to Amman and subsequently offered the appointment of deputy to Peake pasha to pacify Transjordan's desert. The offer was made by the amir and Cox. Peake was on leave at the time and was not consulted. Peake's great fear was that the British officers should be withdrawn from the Arab Legion leaving the tribal sheikhs with a military force with which they could dominate the settled areas, the age old struggle between the desert and the town. However much he disliked the recruitment of Bedouin and the militarization of the Arab Legion, Peake left his deputy to get on with it in the desert&#151;and Glubb was amazingly successful.<br>
<br>Gradually Glubb built up his Bedouin force. They were to become the strike force of the Arab Legion during the Second World War as the desert patrol. In a surprisingly short time the Bedouin raiding ceased and the Jordan desert became safer for the traveller (and tourist) than many a European city. This may not have been appreciated by Peake but it certainly was by Amir Abdullah who had a special empathy for the Bedouin. It was therefore no surprise, on Peake's retirement in March 1939, that Glubb was appointed to succeed him in command of the Arab Legion.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandassessment"></a>Retirement and assessment</h2>Peake had held the local rank of lieutenant-colonel since 1921; in the Arab Legion he held successively the ranks of brigadier (1920&#150;2) and major-general (1922&#150;39), and was made pasha in 1926. He was made CBE in 1926 and CMG in 1939. He also had Transjordanian decorations. On 12 January 1937 he married Elspeth Maclean, younger daughter of Norman Ritchie, of St Boswell's, Roxburghshire; they had one daughter. The couple retired to Elspeth's home in Kelso, Roxburghshire, where Peake served in civil defence throughout the Second World War. Elspeth died in 1967. Peake died at the Cottage Hospital, Kelso, on 30 March 1970, and was buried in Kelso.<br>
<br>Peake and Glubb were very different in character. Peake was an archetypal British officer of his period&#151;an excellent organizer, brave, determined and upright&#151;but he lacked Glubb's imaginative approach. Glubb could think like a Bedouin. Peake was always British. Glubb's loyalty to Amir Abdullah was absolute. Peake's was more ambivalent. He shared Cox's view that Abdullah was financially irresponsible and had to be kept under strict control. Nevertheless he built the Arab Legion on firm foundations and established a tradition of loyalty and efficient discipline which withstood many shocks both within and without the kingdom.<br>
