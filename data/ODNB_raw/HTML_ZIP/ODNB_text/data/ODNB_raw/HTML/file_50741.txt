<span class="headword">Paterson,  Mary Muirhead</span>  (1864&#150;1941), <span class="occ">factory inspector and philanthropist</span>, was born in Glasgow on 23 June 1864, the daughter of Gavin and Annie Paterson. Her father was an affluent businessman; her mother came from a well-known Glasgow family, the Muirheads. Mary Paterson was described as having a gracious personality and great charm. She received her early education at Glasgow Ladies' College; later she was one of the first women students at Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, although the college did not at that time award degrees to women. She had an early and long-standing interest in industrial employment, informing herself of conditions in Scotland, Canada, and the United States of America. While undertaking charitable work in Scotland she gained much knowledge of working-class women's working conditions.<br>
<br>In 1893 Mary Paterson was appointed one of the first two female factory inspectors, together with May Tennant, and she was, therefore, one of the first women to exercise any real authority in industry or power over employers. Her appointment was the direct result of a recommendation of the royal commission on labour (1891&#150;3) for the appointment of women factory inspectors; it was indirectly the result of years of campaigning among trade unionists for the appointment of (working-class) women inspectors, and by middle-class women for greater employment opportunities. In some ways Mary Paterson was pioneering a new kind of work for middle-class women, for&#151;unlike many of the openings for women&#151;factory inspection had no religious links, it was paid, it could not be seen as an extension of domestic work, and it did not fit in with Victorian notions of feminine respectability. There was, however, a link with women's philanthropic interest in the industrial working class. From the outset she drew attention in her reports, extracts of which were published annually, to the appalling conditions and long hours she unearthed in her investigations. Enormous praise was heaped on Paterson and the other early women inspectors, although what they were able to achieve in practice was severely limited; they dealt with the working conditions of all women and girls who came under the <span class="roman">Factory and Workshop Acts</span>. At first she was based in Glasgow and travelled around Scotland and the north of England undertaking inspections. In 1903 she was promoted to senior lady inspector and in 1908 to deputy principal lady inspector, with a transfer to London.<br>
<br>In 1912, as a result of the 1911 <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span>, Paterson became one of the first national health insurance commissioners for Scotland, a post she held until 1919. Just as she had played a pioneering role in women's entry into the factory inspectorate, so too she now took on a newly created administrative role. Based in Edinburgh, she became widely known throughout Scotland as a progressively minded official, who was especially keen to bring women, most of whom were excluded from national health insurance, into the scheme. National health insurance commissioners formed a chain linking central government with local insurance committees and approved societies, to which they distributed money to meet insurance claims. Mary Paterson was well placed to play this bridging role: she was well known in influential London policy-making circles and she made a point of developing close contacts across Scotland. In 1920 she was appointed a CBE.<br>
<br>After her retirement Mary Paterson was heavily involved in philanthropic and civic activities. She again acted as a bridge, this time a symbolic one, between those women active in associational life, who in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century had been largely preoccupied with philanthropic work and local civic life, and a growing body of middle-class professional women, many of whose occupations grew out of this earlier voluntary tradition; the two now continued alongside one another. In the course of the 1920s and 1930s Paterson was variously a JP in Edinburgh, vice-chair of the Scottish Justices and Magistrates Association, chair of the District Nursing Association, honorary member of the British Federation of University Women, and a member of both the League of Nations Union and the Edinburgh Citizens' Association. In her later years she was interested in hospital work and became honorary secretary of the Edinburgh Hospital for Women and Children and a supporter of the Elsie Inglis Maternity Hospital in Edinburgh. She was a well-known speaker in various societies in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Mary Paterson died unmarried on 10 June 1941 at her home in Craufurd, Lasswade, Scotland.<br>
