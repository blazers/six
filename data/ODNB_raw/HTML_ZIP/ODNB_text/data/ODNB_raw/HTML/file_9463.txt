<span class="headword">Finlay,  Francis Dalzell</span>  (1793&#150;1857), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 12 July 1793 at Newtownards, co. Down, Ireland, a son of John Finlay, a tenant farmer, and his wife, Jane Dalzell. He began work as an apprentice to Samuel Archer, a Belfast printer. In 1808 Finlay became superintendent printer on the <span class="italic">Belfast Magazine</span>, founded by William Drennan, one of the leaders of the United Irishmen. About 1815 Finlay, encouraged by Drennan, set up his own printing works, where the quality of his letterpress was said to be far superior to any that had previously been produced in Ireland. In 1824 he founded the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>. The newspaper was the first in Belfast to call itself Liberal, advocating free trade and civil and religious equality. Finlay championed Catholic emancipation and he also supported legislation to regularize the funds of dissenting congregations, resulting in the <span class="roman">Dissenters Chapels Act</span> of 1844. His newspaper supported parliamentary reform, the disestablishment of the Irish church, and the reform of the land laws. The <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> was the first newspaper to publish the proposals of William Sharman Crawford on tenant right. Finlay was a personal friend of O'Connell, though he disagreed with him on his repeal policy and he later rejected the militancy of Young Ireland.<br>
<br>Finlay was frequently involved in libel cases. In July 1826 he was indicted for publishing a libel on the character of an &#145;improving&#146; landlord. The libel was contained in a letter purporting to be by a small farmer who denied that improvements said to have been carried out by his landlord were improvements at all, and accusing the landlord of litigiousness. Finlay was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the publication of the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> was suspended from August 1826 until May 1827. Finlay was also involved in a case in 1830, in which Lord Hertford's agent was said to have been libelled by the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>. The case was suspended when it was found that Daniel O'Connell had agreed to appear for Finlay. Two years later, in July 1832, he was found guilty on a similar charge and sentenced to a fine and three months' imprisonment.<br>
<br>Finlay was a stern employer. During labour disputes in 1836, when his printers gave him an ultimatum on their wages and conditions, he dismissed them and brought in labour from Scotland and other parts of Ireland. When further trouble arose, he set up a secret printing shop in his house and trained young boys as compositors.<br>
<br>In 1830 Finlay married Marianne Porter, a daughter of the Revd William Porter, a Presbyterian minister of Newtownlimavady, co. Londonderry. They had at least one son, also named Francis Dalzell, to whom Finlay bequeathed the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span> upon his death on 10 September 1857 at Glenarm, Antrim. He was buried at the new burying-ground, Antrim Road, Belfast.<br>
