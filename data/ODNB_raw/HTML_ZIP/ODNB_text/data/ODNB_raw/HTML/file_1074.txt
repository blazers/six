<span class="headword">Baillie,  William</span>, Lord Polkemmet  (<em>c.</em>1736&#150;1816), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Baillie (<i>d</i>. 1785), writer to the signet, and his wife, Isobel Walker (<i>d</i>. 1777). Descended from an ancient Linlithgowshire family, he was educated for the bar and was admitted as an advocate in 1758. Baillie served as sheriff-depute of Linlithgowshire for more than twenty years. In 1793, as Lord Polkemmet, he was promoted to the bench and became a senator of the college of justice. He was said to have owed his preferment to Lord Braxfield.<br>
<br>A great favourite with Scottish lawyers, Baillie was liked for his good humour and use of Scottish dialect. After listening to an over-long speech by Henry Erskine he was said to have reserved his judgment to the following day, saying: &#145;I'll just mak'it play wimble-wamble in my wame o'er my toddy till the morrow&#146;  (Paterson). His remarkably long fingers also led to his being dubbed &#145;the judicial fugleman&#146;  (ibid.). Baillie was twice married. His first wife, with whom he had a large family, was a daughter of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss. After her death he married Janet Sinclair (<i>d</i>. 1834), a sister of Sir John Sinclair; there were no children from the second marriage.<br>
<br>Although Lord Polkemmet was &#145;not considered as a first-rate lawyer, or at all fitted to solve difficult legal questions, he had a fund of good sense, which, in the great mass of cases enabled him to discharge his judicial duties with propriety&#146;  (Paterson). He died on 14 March 1816, aged about eighty; his second wife survived him. The baronetcy which was about to be conferred on him was given instead to his son Sir William Baillie (<i>d</i>. 1854).<br>
