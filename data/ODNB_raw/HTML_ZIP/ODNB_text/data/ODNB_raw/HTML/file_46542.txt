<span class="headword">West,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1922), <span class="occ">gas engineer</span>, was born at Northampton on 10 August 1839, the eldest son of Joseph West, a gardener, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Perkins. He was taken on at an early age as an articled pupil by the manager of the local Northampton gasworks and worked his way up to become a departmental manager. After fourteen years he left Northampton and within two years had become manager and engineer of the Maidstone gasworks. It was while at Maidstone, in 1873, that he took out the first of his many patents&#151;for a machine for stoking gas retorts. He set up a company to manufacture the machines, though sales remained limited.<br>
<br>In 1880 West's growing reputation won him the prestigious job as chief engineer of the Manchester corporation gas department, and while there he set about widening the appeal of his stoking machines by applying power to their operation in the form of compressed air, an idea he first patented in the same year. At first his success was limited because the machines kept breaking down; none the less, in 1884 he felt confident enough to give up his salaried post and devote himself full-time to his business, West's Gas Improvement Co. Ltd. Yet business remained slow until in 1893 he finally perfected the compressed-air machinery which soon became widely adopted in Britain and abroad. These machines, together with those of his great rival, William Foulis, gave Britain a world lead in the field, and West's company began to prosper as it also began the manufacture of coal- and coke-handling equipment. In 1898 the capacity of his works at Miles Platting, Manchester, was doubled and a year later the workforce numbered 300.<br>
<br>In 1905 West joined forces with Samuel Glover to manufacture a vertical retort which charged and discharged coal and coke by gravity in a continuous gas-making process. These Glover&#150;West retorts were widely adopted in Britain and overseas, and when West also set up a company to manufacture refractory materials for gasworks he was in a position to contract for the building of entire gasworks anywhere in the world. Despite his advancing years he maintained a close interest in the firm. He took out a patent in 1920, at the age of eighty, and in the same year made a trip to the United States and opened an office in New York. The company continued to grow, so that by the time of his death in 1922 it employed 1100 workers.<br>
<br>West, whom the <span class="italic">Gas Journal</span> described on his death as &#145;an outstanding figure in the gas profession, exceeding the memory of any practising gas engineer&#146;, was energetic and inventive but practical. Typical of his generation of engineers in Britain, he had no formal theoretical training but this did not seem to be a barrier to world leadership in his chosen field. He was a strong-minded man, emphatic in his judgements. As an employer he was paternalistic; he treated his workforce to an excursion to Blackpool each year and entertained them to dinner. He led by example. When one of his machines was being installed in London in 1890 the union men refused to work it without higher pay. He replaced them with non-union labour and this provoked a violent confrontation. But he won through and the editor of the <span class="italic">Gas Journal</span> remembered him &#145;with his shirt sleeves rolled up and overalls on &hellip; with dark faces about him, teaching men how to operate his machine&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>West was an active member the Gas Institute (the gas engineers' society); he was its president in 1893&#150;4 and was awarded their highest honour, the Birmingham medal, in 1918. He was also an active freemason and a magistrate in Manchester from 1904; a staunch Anglican and a sidesman in his parish church where he lived in Southport, he was also at one time the Church of England representative on the Manchester school board.<br>
<br>West was married twice but nothing is known of his wives or the dates of his marriages. He and his second wife had two daughters and five sons, three of whom were active in his company. The eldest, Frederick, succeeded as chairman in 1922, built up the firm into an international concern, and was knighted in 1936. John West died at his home, Alton Lodge, 39 Park Crescent, Southport, on 12 January 1922.<br>
