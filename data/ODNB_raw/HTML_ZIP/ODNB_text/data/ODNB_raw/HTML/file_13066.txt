<span class="headword">Herd,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1732, <em>d.</em> 1810), <span class="occ">song collector and editor</span>, was born at Balmakelly in the parish of Marykirk in Kincardineshire, and baptized there on 23 October 1732, the son of John Herd, a farmer, and his wife, Margaret Low (1691&#150;1751). Little is known of his education. He spent much of his career as a law clerk with David Russell, an Edinburgh accountant, and was described in later life as a &#145;writer&#146; (or solicitor). He was unmarried, but was reputed to have had a natural son, a Captain John Dickson of the King's Own Scottish Borderers who was the principal legatee of Herd's estate.<br>
<br>Herd's classic collection <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Scots Songs, Heroic Ballads &amp;c</span> was published in Edinburgh in 1769 and later reissued in expanded two-volume form (1776). Containing nearly 60 &#145;heroic ballads&#146; and more than 300 miscellaneous songs, it appeared at a time of spectacular literary discovery and realignment. James Macpherson's publication of the poems of Ossian (1761&#150;5), claiming to represent a line of heroic Gaelic poetry dating from the third century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, not only appeared to demonstrate the superior antiquity of Scottish poetry, but also that contemporary &#145;British liberties&#146; were descended from Celtic rather than Anglo-Saxon roots. Urged on by Samuel Johnson, Thomas Percy responded with <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span> (1765). With lavish editorial apparatus and carefully &#145;antiqued&#146; orthography, Percy asserted that English constituted the dominant strand in British literature and that its roots were firmly Teutonic. Percy was happy to include Scottish material within a context of Anglo-Saxon hegemony and had received much material from correspondents in Scotland. But relations quickly cooled, and in 1769 David Herd and his coadjutor and printer John Wotherspoon published <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Scots Songs</span>, with the implication that Scottish tradition ran truer than the English, featuring songs and ballads that were older, better, and more &#145;authentic&#146; than anything Percy could show.<br>
<br>Herd and Wotherspoon insisted on the antiquity of some at least of their material&#151;the collection was the first of its kind published in Scotland to include the word &#145;ancient&#146; in its title  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Society</span>, 217&#150;18)&#151;and they presented the heroic ballads as the &#145;epic tales&#146; of the lowlands, although the inclusion of songs from the recent Jacobite risings suggested that the heroic mode was very much an ongoing concern. Hitherto collections of popular songs had typically contained a heterogeneous mixture of Scots, English, and Irish material, but Herd and Wotherspoon's concentration on songs deriving from the Scottish popular tradition&#151;with lyrics in the vernacular or, where English verses were unavoidable, at least written by Scottish writers&#151;anticipated the rising tide of cultural nationalism that was to mark the early Romantic revival in Europe. Song, they thought, was not merely a uniquely accurate indicator of &#145;the character, genius, taste and pursuits of a people&#146; but enjoyed a dynamically formative role in collective self-definition; it was the very substance of national distinctiveness. Every ancient and &#145;unmixed&#146; nation (an allusion to the traditional view of the English as a mongrel race):<blockquote>hath its peculiar style of musical expression, its peculiar mode of melody; modulated by the joint influence of climate and government, character and situation &hellip; Thus each of the states of ancient Greece had its characteristic style of music &hellip; and thus the moderns have their distinct national styles, the Italian, the Spanish, the Irish, and the Scottish. (D. Herd, &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Scots Songs</span>, 1769)</blockquote>Herd and Wotherspoon stressed the high quality of the music, and their insistence on songs as things to be sung, rather than merely as verses intended to be read, contrasted strongly with Percy. They did not publish the airs, probably on grounds of expense and their already wide diffusion, and when this was done by James Johnson and Robert Burns in <span class="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</span> (1787&#150;1803), the latter superseded <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Scots Songs</span> as the standard edition. Hailed as a classic by Sir Walter Scott and by Joseph Ritson, who praised its scrupulousness and fidelity to tradition, <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Scots Songs</span> was reissued in revised form in 1791 and again in 1869, 1870, and 1973. A selection of songs from Herd's manuscripts was published by Hans Hecht in 1904 with extensive scholarly apparatus and this remains the best single source on Herd's life and work.<br>
<br>Herd arrived at a unitary text for each song by collating multiple variants from a range of published and manuscript sources, correspondents and oral tradition. The social organization of contemporary Edinburgh helped him to build a network of informants. He was a leading light in the Cape Club, one of many quaintly named convivial societies where much of the cultural production of Edinburgh in its golden age was conceived. He was the third sovereign (president) of the Cape and many of its records are in his hand. Members included the poet Robert Fergusson; painters Alexander Nasmyth, Henry Raeburn, and Alexander Runciman (who was Herd's closest friend); John Wotherspoon, his printer; musicians such as F. G. C. Schetky and Stephen Clarke (Burns's friend and the arranger of the music for <span class="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</span>); leading representatives of the Edinburgh stage; and people from many different trades and professions, including the notorious Deacon William Brodie. The club met nightly in James Mann's howff (tavern) in Craig's Close for good ale and conversation, stories, and songs. Herd also frequented John Dowie's tavern in Liberton's Wynd, near to his office in Gosford's Close, where he will have met Robert Burns, whose own club, the Crochallan Fencibles, gathered there. Burns certainly seems to have enjoyed access to Herd's manuscripts, which provided the sources of several of his songs. Herd was also friendly with Walter Scott, the publisher Archibald Constable, and the antiquary and book collector George Paton.<br>
<br>David Herd was austere in appearance with hawk-like features and, in later life, a profusion of grey hair. In character he was affable and unpretentious, generous with time and scholarly advice, and held in affectionate esteem by those who knew him. He died in his lodgings in Potterrow, Edinburgh, on 10 June 1810 and was buried in the nearby Buccleuch parish kirkyard.<br>
