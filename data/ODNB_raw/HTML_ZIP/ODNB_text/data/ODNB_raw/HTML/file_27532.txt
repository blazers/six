<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tone,  (Theobald) Wolfe</span>  (1763&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and political writer</span>, was born in Dublin on 20 June 1763, probably at 27 St Bride Street, the eldest son of Peter Tone (<i>d</i>. 1805), a successful coach builder, and his wife, Margaret Lamport (<i>d</i>. 1818). The Tones had sixteen children, but only five others survived: William (1764&#150;<i>c</i>.1799), Matthew (1771&#150;1798), Mary (<i>c</i>.1779&#150;<i>c</i>.1800), Arthur (<i>b</i>. 1782; last heard of in 1812), and Fanny (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;1792). As the eldest in this close-knit family, Tone took his family responsibilities very seriously. He had Matthew, Arthur, and Mary accompany him at various stages of his life in exile in America and France, giving a home to Mary and finding employment for his brothers. All the children had an adventurous streak, the boys sharing a fascination with military life: Arthur ran away to sea at the age of twelve and William left home when he was sixteen to enlist in the East India Company.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>In the 1760s and early 1770s the Tones were a relatively wealthy middle-class family, living at 44 Stafford Street close to the heart of fashionable Dublin, with property interests elsewhere in Dublin and in co. Kildare. In the late 1770s, however, Peter Tone's business declined, and the family moved out of Dublin to their home at Bodenstown, co. Kildare. This was part of the estate of the distinguished barrister and politician Theobald Wolfe, Tone's godfather and namesake. In 1789 Peter Tone lost all the family property after lengthy and expensive litigation with his elder brother Jonathan (<i>d</i>. 1792) over rightful ownership.<br>
<br>Tone's father was ambitious for his eldest son, and from an early age the boy was educated at private schools with the object of entering university in Dublin; his father stepped in to curb his waywardness, which almost certainly would have caused him to run away from home to embrace a military career. Tone entered Trinity College, Dublin, in February 1781. Much as at school, he was deemed a highly talented but scarcely diligent student, and he was suspended from college for a year because of his involvement in a duel in which a fellow student was killed. Much of his &#145;sabbatical&#146; was spent on amateur dramatics and a romantic liaison with a married woman, Eliza Martin, the wife of Richard Martin, MP for Jameston, co. Leitrim. Though there is much self-mockery in his journals about his appearance, we know that women found him attractive. He was 5 feet 8 inches in height, and while this was considered tall for the age, his slight frame created the impression of smallness. He had brown hair, a smallish, oval-shaped face, deep-set dark eyes, a large nose, and a sallow complexion: &#145;a slight, effeminate-looking man, with a hatchet face, long aquiline nose, rather handsome and genteel looking, with lank, straight hair&#146;, as he is described in a contemporary account  (Walsh, 152&#150;3). Another account thought the posthumous portrait by his daughter-in-law depicted him as far too passive, failing to capture:<blockquote>the small grey glancing eye of the original &hellip; According to my recollection of him he was a <i>very</i> slender, angular <i>rapid</i> moving man, a thin face, sallow and pockmarked, eyes small, lively bright &hellip; laughed and talked fast with enthusiasm about music and other innocent things &hellip; wise he could not be but he had not a foolish look&#151;too lively and smart for that. (TCD, MS 873/38, Sir Philip Crampton to Dr R. R. Madden, 3 May 1843)</blockquote>Tone returned to university in 1783, chastened by his suspension, and had earned a glowing reputation by the time of his graduation in February 1786, most notably for his performances in the college historical society. At Trinity, Tone mixed with and befriended many who were to become statesmen and public leaders. He was being groomed to enter Ireland's political &eacute;lite, and the next stage was training as a barrister at the Middle Temple in London (1787&#150;9). But since there was little required of the students but dining regularly in hall, Tone turned to writing. He collaborated in writing a satirical <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i>, <span class="italic">Belmont Castle</span> (1790), and produced a detailed plan for a British military colony on the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), for which he tried unsuccessfully to elicit the support of the British prime minister, William Pitt.<br>
<br>While still a student at Trinity, Tone eloped with and married, on 21 July 1785, the sixteen-year-old Martha or Matilda Witherington, for which he earned the lifelong enmity of most of her family and that of their relative, the future lord chancellor of Ireland, John FitzGibbon, earl of Clare. <a name="cosubject_59348"></a><span class="headword">Matilda Tone</span>  (1769/70&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span>, as she was known after Tone renamed her Matilda in 1785, was the daughter of William Witherington, a Dublin woollen draper, and the granddaughter of a Church of Ireland clergyman by the name of Fanning. The couple had four children: Maria (1786&#150;1803), <a name="cosubject_27533"></a><span class="headword">William Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>  (1791&#150;1828)<span class="occ"></span>, Francis (1793&#150;1806)&#151;all of whom died of tuberculosis, a particular scourge of the Tone family&#151;and Richard (1794&#150;1795), who died in infancy. Early marriage and the decline in his family's fortune added to Tone's natural impatience as he embarked on his career as a barrister in 1789. The Irish legal profession was a recognized route to political preferment. But it required years of deference to and cultivation of the Irish protestant ascendancy to get anywhere, and the Irish bar was most definitely an appendage of the political establishment. Tone had some early success in attracting the patronage of the powerful whig family the Ponsonbys, but soon railed at the way they expected him to act as a hack writer in their cause&#151;besides which he had by then started to make a name for himself as a talented political writer.<h2>
<a name="Politicalwriter17901792"></a>Political writer, 1790&#150;1792</h2>In 1789&#150;90 Tone had sat in the public gallery of the Irish House of Commons as a heated electoral campaign was waged by the newly formed Irish whig party against placemen and corruption in government. Thus inspired, he produced, in March 1790, a pro-whig pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Review of the Conduct of Administration during the Last Session of Parliament</span>. Even this early, Tone's thinking had gone beyond the traditional whig programme of combating excessive executive power to stating the eighteenth-century classical republican idea of government as a trust, with power ultimately lying with the people. Inspired by the modest success of the pamphlet, Tone addressed another cause of the moment in the follow-up, <span class="italic">Spanish war!: An enquiry how far Ireland is bound of right to embark on the impending contest on the side of Great Britain</span> (July 1790). Though also inspired by debates in the Irish parliament, this was a much more independent work than the <span class="italic">Review</span> and his first analysis of the connection between Britain and Ireland. It called for Irish politicians to take an independent stance on the war issue and bemoaned Ireland's lack of separate national standing. Although in 1790 such ideas were already being aired by others, Tone's pamphlet was deemed dangerous, and he attributed its lack of success to a fearful bookseller suppressing it.<br>
<br>It was while attending the parliamentary debates in 1790 that Tone met and befriended Thomas Russell. Theirs was to be a very special and close friendship, and Russell was the main figure in Tone's celebrated journals. Indeed these were begun by Tone as a form of friendly rivalry with Russell, and they stand as testimony to the quick wit for which Tone was already celebrated during his time at Trinity. He was noted for being able to find the apt and wittiest quote for any situation, and the journals reveal a retentive mind and an impressive command of eighteenth-century ideas and writings. He was also a competent flautist; he packed his flute on his travels and made a special pilgrimage to a famous music store in the Netherlands while acting as United Irish agent to France after 1796. &#145;I admired him for the brilliancy and great variety of his conversation, the gay and social cast of his disposition&#146;, wrote a fellow barrister, William Sampson, traits which are amplified in his personal writings  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 262).<br>
<br>Although Russell did not write with Tone's facility, he was a man of advanced opinions, particularly on religious toleration, and he had a marked influence on Tone's thought. An army officer, he was posted to Belfast in September 1790 and from there also introduced Tone to the thinking of the northern dissenters. It was Russell who wrote asking Tone to compile resolutions for a political club to be established in Belfast on the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, 14 July 1791. These became the founding resolutions for the Society of United Irishmen, but it was the covering letter which was to receive most attention, for it fell into the hands of government and (since it declared Tone's preference for a separation from England) was later used by FitzGibbon to denounce Tone as a traitor. Tone's resolutions were at first rejected by the Belfast reformers (because of their implied demand for Catholic emancipation) and, irritated by such double standards among these self-styled reformers, he produced his most mature political work to date: <span class="italic">An Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland</span> (August 1791).<br>
<br>Tone's <span class="italic">Argument</span> was addressed to protestants (though more specifically the Ulster Presbyterians) who were radicals in politics but resistant to granting Catholics equal rights. In it he reiterated his complaint that Ireland was not recognized as a nation in its own right. The reason for this was the form of government, but the Irish tolerated it because of their own divisions. Thus had earlier reformers failed in their campaigns because government had been able to play upon their fears of the Catholics. He now thought such fears redundant in the newly secularized world created by the French Revolution. In the 1790s only Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span> gained a larger readership in Ireland than Tone's pamphlet, and it impacted on Presbyterians and Catholics alike. The Presbyterians dropped their reservations and invited Tone to Belfast in October 1791 to help found the Society of United Irishmen. The Catholics totally reformed their conservative Catholic Committee to reflect the new radicalism, and in 1792 Tone was invited to join their campaign for Catholic rights as their agent and secretary. He had found his m&eacute;tier as a talented political writer. He always prepared his ground by detailed research, then wrote up his findings quickly, so that there is an immediacy and directness which sets his writings apart from the often torpid style of his contemporaries. Between 1791 and 1792 (the peak of his career as a political writer for both the United Irishmen and the Catholic Committee) he was recognized by both as their most talented propagandist.<br>
<br>It was with Tone's two-week visit to Belfast in October 1791 that his journals opened. These are a witty, often self-mocking account of Tone's and Russell's activities in the town, their late-night socializing at clubs, coteries, and the theatre intermixed with the political discussions associated with the foundation of the Society of United Irishmen. A typical eighteenth-century man of letters, Tone was as fascinated by new technology as by the play of ideas, and he was impressed by Belfast. It was the middle-class capital of Ireland, its largely Presbyterian business class stoking the developments which were already making Ulster the most prosperous province in the country. His growing distrust of aristocracy and privilege was deepened by his Ulster experience, for Belfast was a closed borough, its local government, like central government, monopolized by Ulster's landed (and largely Anglican) class.<h2>
<a name="Politicalactivist17911794"></a>Political activist, 1791&#150;1794</h2>The United Irish Society was finally inaugurated in Belfast on 14 October on the basis of Tone's slightly modified July resolutions. The <span class="italic">Declaration and Resolutions of the Society of United Irishmen of Belfast</span> reiterated many of Tone's arguments and formulated them into three objectives: a union among all the people of Ireland to counter the huge weight of English influence in the country; a radical reform of parliamentary representation as &#145;the sole constitutional mode&#146; by which such influence can be countered; and the inclusion of Irishmen of &#145;every <i>religious</i> persuasion&#146;. Tone and Russell then returned to Dublin as effective ambassadors for the north and inaugurated the Dublin Society of United Irishmen on 9 November on the same principles. Tone's <span class="italic">Argument</span> had been the decisive impetus in convincing the radicals that no reform could be achieved without also addressing Catholic grievances, and, although Tone continued to write on behalf of the United Irish Society and served for short spells early in 1792 as its chairman and secretary, it was in the cause of winning political rights for the Catholics that he devoted most of his efforts for the next three years.<br>
<br>In the leaders of the Catholic Committee, notably wealthy merchants such as John Keogh and Richard McCormick, Tone discovered the same middle-class community of interest against the Anglican political establishment which he so admired in Belfast. That Anglican ascendancy had conducted a vitriolic attack on the Catholic leaders in the parliamentary debates of February 1792, when the Catholics' petition for relief was rejected by a huge majority. In April Tone was invited to become agent and assistant secretary to the Catholic Committee, and for the rest of the year his energies were devoted to organizing national elections to a Catholic Convention to petition for Catholic rights. He accompanied John Keogh on a number of campaigning trips to win support, most notably to the north, where he was considered the bridge to the Presbyterians. A year after his resolutions had been defeated on 14 July 1791, he returned again to Belfast for Bastille day celebrations, this time as a Catholic agent. Knowing of continued opposition to immediate Catholic relief from a number of leading reformers, Tone's address of 1792 was much more conciliatory than that of 1791, and was accepted. But two visits to Rathfriland, co. Down, in July and August, to defuse growing sectarian conflict there, aroused considerable resentment from the local gentry, and on the second visit the delegates were all but run out of the town.<br>
<br>Throughout that summer it was Tone who conducted the publicity side of the Catholic Committee's campaign, responding to a series of letters in the northern press and, most notably, confronting leading members of the ascendancy who, through the country's grand juries, issued bigoted statements against Catholic relief. The statements declared that the Catholics were acting unconstitutionally and that a protestant ascendancy had been established by the revolution of 1688; with a superciliousness which infuriated the newly confident Catholic leaders, they denounced the Catholic leaders for not behaving sufficiently humbly. These addresses were badly written and a gift to someone like Tone. In a series of ripostes published in the press under the <i>nom de plume</i> Vindex, he assumed the character of the ordinary man (a favourite device of his) and showed the concept of a protestant ascendancy to be a pretence for unaccountable power and corruption. The ascendancy campaign backfired badly, and as a result the Catholics' cause attracted additional support from reforming protestants.<br>
<br>The object of all the campaigning, the Catholic Convention, opened in Dublin on 3 December, with 233 elected delegates. It was the first national body of lay Catholics to meet in over a century, and Tone's diary is the fullest account we have of the internal debates. While it highlights tensions between the more traditional conservatism of leading Catholics and the new radicalism of the age, the latter won the day because of the Irish administration's undisguised expectations that Catholics should behave submissively. The convention voted to go over Dublin Castle's authority and present their petition directly to the king. Tone was one of the delegation who travelled to London via Belfast, where his special relationship with the northerners was applauded by the crowds, who cheered the delegates and accompanied their carriage out of the town. In January 1793 they were well received by the king and the home secretary, Henry Dundas, who privately was trying to overcome the Irish ascendancy's resistance to Catholic emancipation. But war broke out between Britain and France in the following month. The political class on which the governance of Ireland depended was in mutinous mood, and the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> of April 1793 fell short of Catholic expectations. Although the franchise (removed in 1728) was restored, the right to sit in parliament was rejected, and the tone of the debate was so anti-Catholic that the concessions were robbed of much of their conciliatory effect. The fragile unity of the Catholics fell apart, and Tone openly accused Keogh of having compromised their cause in London. But worse was to come, as the war crisis brought an immediate clampdown on the activities of the reformers and the arrest of a number of the United Irish leaders.<br>
<br>Tone was seriously disillusioned and spoke to Russell about emigrating to America. He had totally neglected his friends and family for much of the past year in his service to the Catholic Committee and &#145;muzzled&#146; his own radicalism for fear of harming the Catholics by association. He had argued the Paineite principle that people had the right to vote for the laws by which they were governed, and he had admitted privately his belief that Ireland might fare better as an independent nation. But he was no doctrinaire, and in a broadside written on behalf of the United Irishmen in March 1793 he argued: &#145;we have no right to force men to be free&#146;. &#145;If a nation wills a bad government, it ought to have that government&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 100/34/111). Indeed, given the reputation which he was to acquire as the &#145;father&#146; of Irish republicanism, Tone's response of July 1793 to FitzGibbon's public revelation of his 1791 letter to Russell speaks volumes for his constitutionalism, even this late. FitzGibbon used it to argue that the Catholic elections of 1792 had been organized by Tone to induce the lower orders to rebel. But, far from feeling in any way threatened, Tone went immediately to press to denounce what he considered a particularly dishonourable use of a private letter. A desire to reduce England's influence on Ireland's government was not treason, he argued; it had been the core of the parliamentary patriot movement in the 1780s and latterly of the whigs. Certainly there was no sign of Tone's contemplating active republicanism at this stage, and, as the United Irish Society continued to fall apart, he stopped attending and decided reluctantly to return to his career as a barrister.<h2>
<a name="Theemergenceofarevolutionary17941795"></a>The emergence of a revolutionary, 1794&#150;1795</h2>In April 1794 Tone became involved with a French agent, William Jackson, and his future was changed decisively. Archibald Hamilton Rowan was one of a tiny handful of landed gentry in the otherwise middle-class United Irish Society, and, like his class, he tended to act with an irresponsibility which even Tone (who admired him) criticized. Even so, his arrest, trial, and imprisonment in January 1794 for distributing an address deemed seditious by the authorities was a terrible shock to the reformers, still unattuned to the brutal new realities of a government crackdown in time of war. Tone met Jackson while visiting Rowan in prison. On 14 April, at Rowan's request, Tone did what he had so often done before: he produced a paper on the state of Irish public opinion, in which he restated his belief that Ireland was governed by a protestant aristocracy in the interests of England. But now he thought there would be a popular revolt, led by the Ulster Presbyterians, if France invaded and disclaimed any idea of conquest. It is difficult to know what to make of this undoubtedly militant statement, for Tone had been a voice of restraint in recent months in the United Irish Society. Nor is it clear that he was apprised of Jackson's motivation (though Rowan was) when he wrote the paper, and, when told on 16 April about Jackson's real identity and invited to travel to France as an Irish agent, he quickly backtracked and insisted on Rowan's burning the document. But Rowan had taken copies, and these were sent to France by Jackson. They were intercepted in the post and Jackson was arrested on 28 April.<br>
<br>What happened next is a remarkable insight into how Tone was viewed by the authorities, for, although he later admitted that he expected to be hanged, he was permitted to make a compact with government, giving a full account of his dealings with Jackson and an undertaking to leave the country, in return for immunity. He refused to compromise others (a refusal made easier by the escape and flight of Rowan on 1 May) and he withdrew entirely to the country for the rest of the year. He was regarded by the authorities as a nuisance, a talented tool in the hands of others, rather than a dangerous conspirator, and Dublin Castle was more anxious to get rid of him than to make an example of him. Indeed, in the early months of 1795, with the prospect of a more liberal regime under the new whig lord lieutenant, Earl Fitzwilliam, it even looked as if Tone might be rehabilitated, and he was invited back as agent by the Catholic Committee and accompanied another delegation to London that March. But the recall of Fitzwilliam, the introduction of a more hard-line regime under his successor, Earl Camden, and, most of all, the trial of Jackson on 23 April 1795 revealed Tone's immunity to be less secure than he supposed. It was the first occasion on which his involvement was made public, and there was an outcry. It was made clear to him that, if he did not speedily fulfil his agreement of quitting the country, he risked being tried for treason. Within weeks Tone had assigned the family cottage in Kildare over to his cousin, resigned from the bar, and made ready to leave for America. There is a real sense of danger in the rushed preparations, and many old friends rallied around. The Catholic Committee in particular raised all the outstanding payment owing to him, and, after settling his debts, he was left with &pound;796 to start his new life. But, having rejected the idea of becoming a secret agent to France a year earlier, this is exactly what Tone now agreed to do.<br>
<br>The situation in Ireland had dramatically deteriorated on Fitzwilliam's recall and the radicals now despaired of achieving reform constitutionally. Russell was already involved in reorganizing the United Irishmen in north-east Ulster on a more secretive basis and clearly had a major impact on Tone's thinking in these weeks of unreality. In Dublin some leading Catholics and United Irishmen were taking a similar line and asked Tone to negotiate military assistance from France. He, Matilda, their children, his sister Mary, and his brother Arthur arrived in Belfast on 21 May 1795, from where they took ship for America on 12 June. Given the sense of danger and haste surrounding his departure from the south, the send-off which he and his family received in Belfast both testifies to the special esteem with which he was regarded there and amply justifies the warmth with which he speaks of the town and its people in his writings. There was a round of farewell social gatherings and a special subscription which raised some &pound;1500 for Tone and his family. One gathering acquired particular significance both for Tone and the future nationalist tradition. During a large family picnic to the deer park just north of Belfast, Tone and a group of United Irish friends, including Russell, Henry Joy McCracken, Samuel Neilson, and Robert Simms, ascended the Cave Hill to its highest point, McArt's Fort, and there made &#145;a most solemn obligation &hellip; never to desist in our efforts, until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted her independence&#146;  (W. T. W. Tone, 1.127&#150;8). In Irish nationalist tradition this is seen as the symbolic moment when modern Irish republicanism was born, testimony to the influence which Tone's journals and autobiography would later acquire, for his is the only account of the incident. Many in Ireland had felt Tone's treatment far exceeded his crime, and there can be no doubt that the militant republicanism for which he is best known was something of an accident of timing. Certainly the French revolutionary wars had made treasonable ideas which would not have been considered so a few years earlier, and Tone was able to operate unnoticed in France for almost two years because of this perception of him as hardly dangerous. Even so his character predisposed him to the revolutionary career on which he now embarked. &#145;The genius of Wolfe Tone&#146;, wrote David Plunket, the son of his friend and the future lord chancellor William Conyngham Plunket, &#145;was accompanied by its full share of eccentricity. His mind, powerful and impulsive, rushed at its object without looking to consequences, and foiled in one direction charged with double energy in another&#146;  (Plunket, 1.60&#150;61).<br>
<br>The Tone family arrived in the United States on 1 August 1795 and took up residence in its new capital, Philadelphia. On 10 August Tone had his first audience with the French minister to Philadelphia, Pierre Adet, and over the next three days he wrote two statements, outlining the nature of the help the United Irishmen were seeking from France. But as Adet took his time in responding, Tone set about finding a home for his family. He eventually opted for Princeton, New Jersey, and seemed to be contemplating permanently taking up the life of a farmer. But reminders from his United Irish friends in Ireland about his undertaking sent him back to Adet in November, by which time the French minister was more responsive, and he approved his mission to the French government. Moreover, Tone was deeply unhappy in America. He found its people uncultured, overconfident, and materialistic, its climate too hot, its countryside unnatural. Neither he nor Matilda were keen to bring up their children among people whom he described as &#145;boorish and ignorant &hellip; uncivil and uncouth&#146;  (Elliott, <span class="italic">Wolfe Tone</span>, 267). His witty irreverence disappeared from his writings, as he recognized how much he missed the friendship he had known in Ireland. Although he, like the other United Irish leaders, had eulogized America as the first land of liberty, he found even its politics disappointing. The pro-British, anti-French federalists were in the ascendant. They were the party of big money and executive power, and Tone moved instead in the circle of their political opponents, the democratic republicans. Through the republicans he gained an introduction to France, through their representative in Paris, the future American president James Monroe. He sailed from New York on 1 January 1796, having acquired a false passport under the pseudonym James Smith. Matilda fully supported his decision and, so as not to dissuade him, kept the fact that she was pregnant again secret until after he had set sail.<h2>
<a name="MissiontoFrance1796"></a>Mission to France, 1796</h2>Tone arrived at Le Havre on 2 February 1796 and reached Paris ten days later. He was fortunate in the timing of his arrival, for France was seeking revenge on England after its support for the French royalists in recent hostilities. Even so, Tone's success as a secret diplomat in France was remarkable, and other foreign revolutionaries demanding French help were not generally so well received. Tone secured his entr&eacute;e to the French foreign ministry through Monroe. But he quickly sensed the divisions which bedevilled the regime then in power, the Directory, and resented having to deal with subalterns. On 24 February he accordingly took his case to the very top, in a private audience with the director charged with war policy, Lazare Carnot, and through him the Irish campaign was brought to the heart of French military strategy. It was, as ever, Tone's ability as a political writer which won the French over. His memorials on the Irish situation, written in February and making their way through the relevant French ministries over the next two months, outlined how France might use Ireland to combat her main enemy. They told of the alliance between Catholics and dissenters in the United Irishmen. But France must send a large enough force to prevent a civil war. The object was to attain Irish independence, and the French general should issue a manifesto disavowing all idea of conquest, offering protection to property and religion, and inviting the people to establish a national convention which would then form a government. It was a revolution Tone sought, not an insurrection, and he convinced the Directory that an Irish rising prior to a French invasion should be avoided. There is much in Tone's French writings about the need to minimize bloodshed. Although he had not condemned the execution of Louis XVI in 1793&#151;thinking it &#145;necessary&#146; if regrettable&#151;in Paris he saw the places associated with the excesses of the terror and shuddered. &#145;If we have a republic in Ireland, we must build a Pantheon, but we must not, like the French, be in too great a hurry to people it&#146; (TCD, MS 2048/21; W. T. W. Tone, 2.40&#150;41).<br>
<br>Tone was short of money and lacked the friendship and sociability on which he had thrived in Ireland, and his early Paris journals lack the wit of his Irish ones. But the success of his mission had transformed his life by the summer and brought him a new set of friends. Foremost among these was France's top republican general, Lazare Hoche, fresh from his victory over civil war in the west and being courted by Carnot to accept command of an Irish invasion force. Tone was called to the seat of the Directory, the Luxembourg Palace, on 12 July to meet with him. Tone would have been pleased with the communications between Hoche and the Directory after their meeting, for he had clearly won his case about Ireland's independence guaranteeing France an ally in her war against England. There would be no question about Ireland's being retained as a French conquest. Over the next days plans for the Irish invasion force were drawn up and Tone was made an adjutant-general in the French army. He had requested such a commission as a way of ensuring treatment as a prisoner of war. &#145;I was willing to encounter danger, as a soldier, but &hellip; I had a violent objection to being hanged as a traitor&#146; (TCD, MS 2049/27; W. T. W. Tone, 2.71). But it was also the fulfilment of a lifetime's ambition, and he was to prove a good soldier, even though he had feared resentment from other French officers at such obvious inexperience and over-promotion. At Rennes, where he arrived to participate in the invasion preparations on 20 September, he lodged with Hoche and the other officers and was enthralled by the camaraderie of military life.<br>
<br>It was in the interval between his appointment and departure for the west that Tone wrote the document on which much of his future reputation was based: his &#145;Memorandums, relative to my life and opinions&#146;, or autobiography. This&#151;with the seventeen notebooks of his journals&#151;was published thirty years later as <span class="italic">The Life of Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>. It was undoubtedly influenced by the situation in which he found himself in the summer of 1796. His mission had succeeded beyond his wildest dreams, and there is a sense of destiny in the autobiography not present in his journals. There are many similarities between it and the propaganda he had been writing for France in preparation for the anticipated invasion of Ireland. In it his youthful rejection by Pitt, the haughtiness of the aristocratic faction in Ireland, his admiration for the Catholic Committee and the Ulster Presbyterians (whom together he envisaged forming Ireland's new government) came together in his &#145;theory&#146;, a theory which he now believed had motivated him since 1791:<blockquote>To subvert the tyranny of our execrable Government, to break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our political evils, and to assert the independence of my country&#151;these were my objects. To unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissensions, and to substitute the common name of Irishman in the place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter&#151;these were my means. (TCD, MS 2046/41<i>v</i>)</blockquote>This was to become the most quoted passage in modern Irish history.In the summer of 1796 Tone compiled the various proclamations for the invasion and was also charged with recruiting among the English and Irish prisoners of war. But preparations for the departure of the invasion force were frustratingly slow. The naval command prevaricated, and sufficient supplies were proving difficult to find. News reaching Tone of the deteriorating situation in Ireland and the arrests of most of his friends, including Russell, intensified his frustration, and he persuaded Hoche to dispatch a secret agent to Ireland to let them know of the forthcoming invasion and urge them to do all in their power to defer the trials. The fleet finally sailed from Brest on 15 December, carrying 14,450 troops, 41,644 stand of arms, and a supply of uniforms and cockades for the Irish expected to join them, and the Directory, fired by the successful passage of such a large expedition through an intensified British blockade, ordered a follow-up expedition of 17,000 men. Tone sailed on board the <i>Indomptable</i>, the largest ship in the expeditionary force. But the fleet encountered bad weather, and the frigate carrying Hoche and the naval commander (and all the printed addresses which Tone had composed for distribution in Ireland) was blown off course. The remainder of the fleet arrived at Bantry Bay in south-west Ireland on 22 December and Tone spent the evening preparing new addresses. But a storm blew up that night and over the next few days decimated the fleet. In the early days of 1797 fifteen of the original forty-three ships limped back to France. &#145;England&#146;, commented Tone, &#145;has not had such an escape since the Spanish Armada&#146;  (W. T. W. Tone, 2.266). And so indeed it was, for the British navy and defence forces had been taken totally by surprise, and even this failed attempt caused a major political and economic crisis in Britain and Ireland.<h2>
<a name="LifeintheFrencharmy17971798"></a>Life in the French army, 1797&#150;1798</h2>Tone was rescued from his despair only by the return of Hoche. He greeted Tone like a long-lost friend, assured him that he had not abandoned the Irish project, and invited him to join his staff with his new posting on the Rhine. Tone arrived at Cologne on 7 April 1797, but was denied his first taste of active service by urgent family concerns. His family had arrived in Hamburg in January after a protracted and stormy passage from America which had left Matilda extremely ill; she seems to have miscarried the baby she was carrying at the end of 1796. He secured leave from Hoche and travelled to Groningen in the Netherlands, where the family joined him on 7 May. His journals of his journey there show an impressive knowledge of the history and society of the countries through which he passed and a thirst for further information. He disliked the public display of Catholicism during Holy Week in Cologne&#151;directing a characteristic enlightenment attack on friars, monks, and convents&#151;and preferred the simpler practice of Dutch protestantism. Indeed the Dutch (Batavian) Republic he thought the model of good government. To this he attributed the country's commercial prosperity and the benefits it brought to the populations of northern Europe. He extolled the cleanliness of the Netherlands, comparing the country with the &#145;slovenliness&#146; of Ireland, which he attributed to its poverty. The journal also reveals a tough attitude to governing systems. Tone thought republican government should be strong government, even supporting censorship of opposition press.<br>
<br>But although it took Tone some time to recognize it, his own mission to France steadily fell apart after the Bantry Bay failure. Hoche remained totally committed to another expedition, and his headquarters in Germany became the effective centre for continuing negotiations. It was from there that Tone was sent in June to bring back a new United Irish agent, Edward Lewins. He was a colleague from early United Irish and Catholic Committee campaigning in Dublin, and Tone remained loyal and supportive, despite signs over the next year that Lewins was not as active in his mission as he should have been. They agreed that Lewins should continue the negotiations in Paris which Tone had started, while Tone would work with any expedition to be sent to Ireland. In July 1797 this involved Tone's relocating to the Texel in the Netherlands, where France's Dutch ally had taken up the Irish invasion scheme, while Hoche would accompany another force apparently preparing in Brest. In July, however, Hoche became the scapegoat in a thwarted coup attempt which, if successful, would have seen him installed as the new war minister. He became demoralized by the bitter press attacks which followed, and when Tone arrived at Hoche's headquarters at Wetzlar, on 12 September, he found him in the advanced stages of tuberculosis. Two days later he died, aged twenty-nine, Tone being one of a handful of confidants who attended his deathbed. Hoche had been a good friend to Tone&#151;as well as his most influential supporter&#151;and his coterie of republican generals continued such support and friendship. But they lacked Hoche's stature and influence, and his loss left the way clear for the rise of his most bitter rival, Napoleon Bonaparte, for whom republican causes were anathema.<br>
<br>The threatened coup in France finally came about in September (the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of Fructidor) and removed from power nearly all the officials with whom Tone had negotiated, most notably Carnot. Tone&#151;who had returned to Paris after Hoche's death&#151;felt he and Lewins were having to start from scratch, and even though they secured audiences with Bonaparte himself, among others, they were receiving little more than generalized statements of support. The truth was that the post-Fructidorean &#145;second&#146; Directory had adopted a much tougher policy towards foreign revolutionaries of only helping those who helped themselves. There would be no more expeditionary forces sent until the Irish had staged a rising. But Tone and Lewins, ignorant of this sea change in policy, continued to urge the United Irishmen to reserve their strength until the French arrived. That strength was steadily eroded through 1797 and early 1798, and the leadership was weakened by internal disagreement over the issue of rising before or after the French arrived.<br>
<br>The fallout from this split soon affected Tone's mission, as competing agents began to arrive on the continent from mid-1797. Many of the newer arrivals in France now gravitated to a Paris grouping led by the veteran patriot Napper Tandy, which was increasingly hostile towards Tone and Lewins. Indeed Tandy's public posturing and egotism betrayed Tone's activities in France to the British government for the first time since his arrival in 1796. Although he had made great personal sacrifices in pursuit of his mission, he now found himself the object of petty intrigue and was particularly hurt by accusations that he had sacrificed his country's interest to his own. He had always prided himself on his sense of honour and integrity&#151;and indeed was recognized for such when he was in Ireland&#151;and saw his personal sacrifices as part of his republican credentials. The only reward which he sought was in the reputation and gratitude of his countrymen, and the thought of being denied these preoccupied him throughout the early months of 1798. It was something of a relief to be posted to Rouen in April, where preparations were being made to invade England. In fact Bonaparte had already abandoned an English invasion in favour of his ill-fated Egyptian expedition, and Tone was ordered to Le Havre as adjutant to the commanding general defending the town against British bombardment.<br>
<br>By then Tone thought there was little chance of an Irish expedition, and reports coming through of the deteriorating situation in Ireland, mounting arrests, including those of nearly all his friends, the death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the declining state of Russell in prison, all fed a new desperation in his writings. He was not a naturally vengeful person, but he now wrote of avenging these &#145;martyrs of liberty&#146;, and of confiscating the property of the gentry (which he had rejected in the past). On 17 June he learned that a rising had finally broken out in Ireland, and he was recalled to Paris, where the news had reactivated the Directory's plans to invade. But, with the bulk of the army in Egypt, preparations were rushed and piecemeal. Several small forces were to land at different points on the Irish coast, and Tone was sent to join the main force of 8000 men preparing at Brest under one of Hoche's friends, General Hardy. Once again he was sent by the marine minister to recruit among the Irish and British prisoners of war, and on 1 August he arrived at Brest, where he joined Hardy on board the flagship <i>Hoche</i> (74 guns). But it was not until 16 September that the fleet finally sailed, and Tone knew that Britain had full knowledge of its movements and of his own presence on board, for they had been reported in the press. It is clear from his correspondence that he had no hope of its succeeding, but, as his son William recalled, he felt it his duty to accompany it. He told Matilda that &#145;he knew his life was gone&#146;, and he signed over to her full power of attorney. The fleet was tracked along the Irish coast by the British navy, and, on 12 October, as it was buffeted by a storm within sight of its Lough Swilly destination, it was attacked. Battle raged all day and Tone commanded one of the batteries. It was sinking when finally captured. The <i>Hoche</i> was to have been taken to Portsmouth, but it was blown off course by the continuing storm and only finally brought back to Lough Swilly on 31 October.<h2>
<a name="FinaldaysOctoberNovember1798"></a>Final days, October&#150;November 1798</h2>Tone was reported to be among the first to step on shore. He had hoped his rank in the French army would have been respected, and he protested to the Irish commanders, to Dublin Castle, and to the French official charged with overseeing the exchange of prisoners of war at being treated like a common criminal and chained in Derry gaol. There was nothing insincere in this. He did expect death. But over the past two years he had been a French officer and by all accounts a good one. Having at first sought such a commission precisely to cover the perilous situation in which he now found himself, he had ended up assuming the persona of a French soldier and had insisted on wearing full dress uniform as he was brought a prisoner to Dublin.<br>
<br>Tone was imprisoned in the royal barracks and tried by a military court on 10 November. Charges of treason were read. He objected to the word &#145;traitorously&#146; and read out an explanation of his actions. He spoke of the sacrifices he had made in a cause for which he was now ready to lay down his life, explaining how he tried to end the religious divisions in Ireland, and that when his friends abandoned him the Catholics had stood by him. He spoke of his pride in winning the esteem of his comrades in the French army and regretted the atrocities which had occurred in Ireland: &#145;I have attempted to establish the independence of my country; I have failed in the attempt; my life is in consequence forfeited&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 100/79/95&#150;97). And he requested the death of a soldier by firing squad. He spent the following day writing final letters to Matilda, his father, his friends, and Matilda's brother and sister, asking them to take care of her. He learned of his fate that evening. He would be hanged publicly at 1 p.m. the following day, apparently at the insistence of some of his old opponents. But Lord Lieutenant Cornwallis had rejected the request that his head be struck off and publicly displayed. Tone wrote a final letter thanking his gaoler for having acted towards him like an officer and that night cut his own throat. He had written frequently in his journals of his horror of the shame of hanging and had admired the self-discipline of classical figures such as Cato in choosing suicide as an honourable end. He died on 19 November 1798, and his remains were given over to his family immediately following a coroner's inquest. His body was taken from the house of his relatives, the Dunbavins, at 52 High Street, where his parents had been living in straitened circumstances, and was buried at the family plot in Bodenstown on 21 November. His entire wealth on death&#151;which he asked to be divided between his father and his wife&#151;consisted of &pound;50, a gold watch, and his trunk of clothes.<br>
<br>After Tone's death his widow, Matilda, remained in France, where she brought up her three remaining children with the help of a pension, belatedly granted by the Napoleonic government, due to her as the widow of a general in the French army. The only child to survive into adulthood, William, was educated at the cavalry school of St Germain and became a naturalized citizen. He fought in the Napoleonic army as lieutenant and aide-de-camp to General Bagneres and supported Bonaparte after his escape from Elba; he resigned his commission following the restoration of the monarchy in 1815. In July 1816 Matilda married a long-term friend and benefactor, Thomas Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1824), a Scottish radical who had been well liked by Tone, at the British embassy in Paris. She and her new husband and her son hoped to settle in Ireland, but the Irish administration refused to allow them to return. Instead they embarked for America and settled at Georgetown. William studied law in New York and briefly served in the artillery before pursuing a career in the War Office. In 1825 he married Catherine Sampson, the daughter of William Sampson (1764&#150;1836), an old Dublin friend of his parents; they had one daughter, Grace Georgiana. William died on 10 October 1828 and was buried on Long Island. Matilda survived into old age and died in 1849, aged eighty.<br>
<br>In 1826 Matilda and William published Tone's journals and writings. They formed the basis of the cult which by the twentieth century had turned Tone into the most influential inspiration of modern Irish nationalism and republicanism. But the cult had a slow gestation, coming to full maturity only with Fenianism's and Sinn F&eacute;in's promotion of the cult of the martyred dead. The tradition of republican speeches at his grave in Bodenstown began during the 1798 centenary celebrations: Patrick Pearse in his 1913 speech pronounced Tone's 1796 &#145;theory&#146; as encompassing &#145;the entire philosophy of Irish nationalism&#146;, particularly its &#145;blood sacrifice&#146; tradition. But nationalists of all hues look back to Tone as their founding father, many groupings, besides republicans, paying annual pilgrimages to his grave. Today there is no sizeable town in the Irish Republic without a street named after him.<br>
