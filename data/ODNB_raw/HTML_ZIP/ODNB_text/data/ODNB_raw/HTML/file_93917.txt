</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jennings, Sir  Robert Yewdall</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">jurist, international lawyer, and judge</span>, was born on 19 October 1913 at 25 Sherborne Villas, Town Lane, Idle, near Bradford, Yorkshire, the only son of Arthur Jennings and his wife, Edith Schofield, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brotherton. He was brought up in solid but simple circumstances. His mother was a mill worker; her father, a butcher, could neither read nor write, but was a lively character with an affectionate relationship with his grandson. His paternal grandfather was a clerk at the mill, and his father, Arthur Jennings, though describing himself with a degree of pride on the birth certificate as &#145;manager&#146;, in fact worked for a small company making paper tubes for wrapping yarn with only a few other men under his supervision, and never earned more than a modest salary. He had himself left school at fourteen, but had internationalist leanings which he shared with his son. He was a Methodist lay preacher, another avocation shared by his son in his early years.<h2>
<a name="Educationearlyacademiccareerandwarservice"></a>Education, early academic career, and war service</h2>Jennings was endowed by nature with exceptional intelligence and with a fair quantity as well of Yorkshire obstinacy and grit, the first evidenced by the fact that he made it his own ambition to get not just to university, but to Oxford or Cambridge, and the second by the fact that he saw the purpose through from the unpromising starting place of Belle Vue secondary school (which had never before sent a boy to Oxbridge) after having turned down a place at Bradford grammar school because he wanted to stay with the boys he knew. The stubbornness must however have been laced with a tinge of fantasy, because his first choice was Trinity, Oxford, on no better basis than that he'd read about its fine avenue of lime trees. Trinity, to its credit, gave him an interview and in due course the offer of a place, but no scholarship, which was in his circumstances the essential prerequisite. The choice therefore fell back on Downing College, Cambridge, on the more pragmatic ground that its fees were relatively cheap, and in due course Downing obliged with a scholarship. It was not until Jennings arrived to take up residence, in the autumn of 1931, that the blow fell: a lordly senior tutor informed him that times were hard, so the scholarship would be for the honour only. A crisis family conference followed; the county was profoundly uninterested in funding the outlandish idea of Jennings studying in Cambridge rather than locally in Leeds. His father undertook, however, to scrape together enough to keep him for one year. With his whole future depending on it, Jennings duly took a starred first in part one of the law tripos, which earned him a Squire scholarship, and graduated with another starred first in part two in 1935 and yet another in the LLB a year later, collecting the Whewell and Cassell scholarships along the way. If the choice of law remains hard to explain (nothing in his background suggesting it), the focus on international law from the outset of his career is accounted for by the spell cast over him as an undergraduate by Sir Arnold McNair, who remained a lifelong influence, and the closest there could be to a hero for Jennings. Jennings later wrote McNair's entry in this dictionary.<br>
<br>At the urging of Henry Hollond, reader in English law at Cambridge and dean of Trinity College, Jennings put in for, and won, a Choate fellowship to Harvard for the year 1936&#150;7, which proved a happy and fulfilling time, opening his eyes as well as his mind, and leaving him with a lasting respect for the United States and its people. His duties at Harvard consisted of little more than to read, and that he did widely and assiduously. After returning to London in 1937 he kept himself by teaching at the London School of Economics and lecturing to bar students at the Inns of Court school of law. Two years later he successfully applied for a Cambridge fellowship, at Jesus College, but the Second World War intervened before he could get into his stride.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the war Jennings's romantic idea was to join the navy, but the recruiting office in Cambridge was manned by a former Jesus College porter, who wisely thought otherwise, and in 1940 Jennings duly found himself recruited into army intelligence. A good deal of the work, which appealed to him, involved the study of maps and aerial photographs, leaving him in turn with a fascination for the geographical which later came into play in his studies of territory and boundary disputes in international law. The work was centred in Oxford, which gave him the opportunity to eat his dinners at Lincoln's Inn and to get called to the bar in 1943 (although nothing like a legal practice developed until much later). A short final period of military service abroad, in India and Ceylon, preceded his demobilization in 1946, with the rank of major. It was then back to Cambridge, to his fellowship at Jesus and a university lectureship.<h2>
<a name="CambridgefellowandWhewellprofessorofinternationallaw"></a>Cambridge fellow and Whewell professor of international law</h2> The teaching Jennings hugely enjoyed, and he had a talent for it, including getting his meaning across to returning undergraduates older and more senior than himself. His lectures were marked by a quiet exposition, but one which masked a degree of theatre as he built up to the main points he wanted to convey. Other duties, however, soon thrust themselves on him in an unexpected way. He was prevailed upon by his colleagues at Jesus to fill in at short notice as senior tutor, and then to accept the position substantively in 1949 when the prospective appointee fell by the wayside. It was a demanding post, one whose functions would later have been spread between several college officers, and must have been doubly demanding for someone who had so recently arrived at the college himself. He deployed his bargaining position to plead for a secretary, which was grudgingly granted in the form of one for all the fellows, though she could sit in Jennings's outer room (so long as he himself provided the furniture). The happy side-effect was the arrival to fill the post in due course of Christine Dorothy Bennett, whom, after a long, shy courtship, Jennings married on 4 August 1955. She was the daughter of Henry Bernard Bennett, inspector of taxes, of Exmouth, Devon, and fourteen years younger than her husband. It was a partnership of lasting and enduring happiness, and growing pride in the accomplishments of their three children, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1956), Philippa (<i>b</i>. 1958), and Joanna (<i>b</i>. 1962).<br>
<br>The year 1955 proved an <i>annus mirabilis</i> for Jennings, as it also marked his election to the Whewell chair in Cambridge on the translation of the holder, Hersch Lauterpacht, to the International Court of Justice. The question that prompts itself is why the choice fell, for this post of the highest prestige in international law, on a young scholar not yet widely known in the field, whose academic output remained modest. Several answers may be offered. One is that in those days scholarly attainment weighed less heavily, appointments tended to be internal, and the internal competition was not all that strong (the only real contender being even younger than Jennings). But there are positive reasons that outweigh those rather negative ones. Jennings was a diligent and popular teacher, to whom students responded well. Unusually for the time in Britain he had set out to specialize in international law from the outset, rather than moving across to it from some other legal field. Among the electors Jennings would have had the firm support of Hollond and McNair, reckoning (accurately) on his professorial potential, but the view must have been shared by Humphrey Waldock (from Oxford) and by Sir Eric Beckett (the former legal adviser to the Foreign Office), even though Jennings would not have been Lauterpacht's own first choice. Another positive factor&#151;though one more difficult to assess&#151;is the regard Jennings had gained in the university as a whole, not for his scholarship but for his administrative ability. His college senior tutorship had branched out, in turn, into membership of the university's council and general board, and chairmanship of the important needs committee, all of which he much enjoyed, and was evidently good at because it led to pressure on him (which in the end he resisted) to take on the full-time position of secretary-general of the faculties. This aspect of his reputation spread far further afield: he was approached by the University of the Witwatersrand when it was making an international search for a new vice-chancellor, and likewise by Leeds whose offer, though he was much tempted, he declined, so that he was still in place when the Whewell vacancy came along. Later still there were four occasions on which he might have become head of house, twice at Jesus itself, and he served as its president in the 1960s and again in the 1970s.<br>
<br>The Whewell electors' choice was a sound one, vindicating the assessment of potential, anchoring Jennings firmly to Cambridge for the rest of his life, offering him a base from which his particular talents could flower, and providing the university with an unbroken twenty-five-year stint of fostering the teaching and study of international law. This period saw the publication of his only book-length work, <span class="italic">The Acquisition of Territory in International Law</span> (1963), but also the beginning of his lengthy collaboration with a former pupil, Arthur Watts, on the monumental ninth edition of <span class="italic">Oppenheim's International Law</span>, which eventually appeared in 1992. He was in addition joint editor of the <span class="italic">International and Comparative Law Quarterly</span> (1956&#150;61) and of the <span class="italic">British Year Book of International Law</span> (1960&#150;82). This period also saw the quiet emergence of his legal practice, under the particular patronage of the City solicitors Coward Chance, and of the international law adviser to the Shell Group of companies, John Blair, much of this practice having to do with international boundary disputes, on sea as well as on land. The high spots were the <i>Buttes Gas case</i>, which went as far as the House of Lords; the arbitrations between the United Kingdom and France on maritime delimitation (where he was responsible for the Channel Islands section) and between Dubai and Sharjah on their land frontier; the Tunisia&#150;Libya maritime case before the International Court of Justice at The Hague; and notably the two boundary arbitrations between Chile and Argentina. All of these offered scope for his patient concern with the facts of complex geographical situations, and gave rise to memorable excursions to the scene, including two visits to Tierra del Fuego, as well as to an extended relationship as adviser to the government of Jersey. He took silk in 1969 and was made a bencher of Lincoln's Inn a year later.<h2>
<a name="TheInternationalCourtofJustice"></a>The International Court of Justice</h2>In 1981 Jennings reached the statutory retirement age. The question of what should come next then solved itself through another stroke of providence. Waldock, by then the British judge on the International Court of Justice, died suddenly in office, and the choice of candidate to succeed him fell on Jennings. Again the choice was not an obvious one: the field was exceptionally strong, and Jennings had far less in the way of practising experience, including before the court itself, than some of his competitors, and no judicial experience whatever. But once more the independent nominating body&#151;two senior judges, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Scarman, and Sir Francis Vallat&#151;backed potential. Unusually the UN security council postponed filling the vacancy for some months, so that Jennings faced, not a relatively straightforward by-election for a &#145;British seat&#146;, but competition over five of the fifteen seats on the court which were falling vacant. To his surprise, he took to the degree of gentlemanly electioneering required, inasmuch as it gave full reign to his naturally courteous interest in people of all origins. The Foreign Office, in its official campaigning, encountered around the world a whole clan of Jennings pupils now in influential positions in government, whose continuing regard for their former professor meant that their support was a matter of course. He comfortably surmounted the electoral hurdle in both the security council and general assembly, and took up a nine-year term in 1982, having earlier that year been knighted.<br>
<br>Jennings liked the court, and the court liked him. He also, unlike some among his colleagues, thoroughly enjoyed living in The Hague, which he discovered to be not that far distant from Cambridge; the practical, rational, nonconformist Dutch proved much to his Yorkshire taste, and the Haagsche Club became a satisfactory substitute for a college common room. Although the evidence is not entirely clear, as his term drew to an end the Foreign Office certainly encouraged him to think of standing again, and it began to appear as if sentiment among the judges was turning towards Jennings as their next president, rather than (as Jennings himself expected) his staunch friend the Italian judge. His re-election followed with the same ease as before, and was duly crowned by the presidency, which he assumed for a three-year period in 1991. That saw him pass his eightieth birthday, still in excellent form physically as well as mentally, so that he faced retirement with increasing reluctance. But good sense prevailed, and he resigned from the court a decent interval after the conclusion of his presidency, thus paving the way for the election of one of his former pupils in his place.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeandassessment"></a>Later life, and assessment</h2>After returning to Cambridge Jennings found his forebodings of inactivity quite misplaced. He was welcomed back with open arms by Jesus College, and in the university more generally, which had conferred on him an honorary doctorate in 1993; the same honour was bestowed by Oxford in 1996. Other academic honours flowed as well, most notably the Manley O. Hudson medal of the American Society of International Law in 1993. All that failed was the life peerage to which his presidency of the International Court of Justice ought to have entitled him; a proposal to that effect, although backed strongly by the lord chancellor, foreign secretary, and attorney-general, foundered in John Major's 10 Downing Street, and the House of Lords lost what would have been a thoughtful and distinctive voice.<br>
<br>Jennings's services continued, however, to be in demand after his retirement. He presided, with characteristic courtesy and grace, over the arbitral tribunal established to decide the territorial and boundary dispute between Eritrea and Yemen in the Red Sea (1996&#150;9). The most striking demonstration, though, of the high regard in which he was held and of his undiminished skill came with his appointment, not long before his ninetieth birthday, to a delicate mission of investigation and conciliation by the World Bank, confronted with an awkward dispute with a senior staff member. His death at the age of ninety came as the result of complications arising out of an unnecessary fall, not from illness or infirmity.<br>
<br>As an international lawyer Jennings founded no &#145;school&#146;, nor indeed did he belong to one. Law, he believed, was a craft as well as a science, and enlightened pragmatism was enough, in enabling the rules not just to be properly understood, but usefully applied. His abiding concerns were those of his generation, what internationalists used to call &#145;the problem of peaceful change&#146;. He was impatient, though, of the na&iuml;ve view of the time that the panacea lay in the universal compulsory judicial settlement of international disputes; but equally impatient of the more modern fantasy (and its cynically &#145;realist&#146; converse) that failed to grasp either that the judicial process need not be the whole part of settling an individual dispute, or that, even if not the whole, it could still be an essential step in clearing the way for a political settlement (as with the Beagle Channel). For him &#145;peaceful change&#146; entailed three necessary elements, of which judicial settlement was only one, the others being codification of the rules and, even more important, adequate methods for adapting or changing them to meet new challenges or circumstances. This theme appeared in his earliest published writings with a precocious firmness and a strikingly enduring relevance. How international law could be ascertained and shaped as it developed was a constant preoccupation. Influenced without a doubt by what he observed of the mammoth endeavour of the third UN conference on the law of the sea, he made the famously waspish remark that &#145;most of what we perversely persist in calling customary international law is not only <i>not</i> customary: it does not even faintly resemble a customary law&#146;, but left the matter there, without offering either a better description or a better theory  (Jennings, &#145;The identification of international law&#146;, in B. Cheng, ed., <span class="italic">International Law: Teaching and Practice</span>, 1987, 3).<br>
<br>Jennings's voice was plain and unassuming, direct, clothed in language deceptively simple for the way it concealed the labour that had gone into the making, the result clear, but above all precise. The flavour was captured in the title for a visiting lecture, subsequently published: &#145;What is international law, and how do we tell it when we see it?&#146;&#151;at first sight almost bathetic, on closer examination englobing exactly the existential question most international lawyers (including judges) wrestle with for most of their working lives. Behind the simplicity lay always a youthful idealism that never died, though it attached itself to different causes as time went by. His writings, whether or not thought sparse for a lifelong academic, were among the items that readers returned to again and again.<br>
<br>On the International Court of Justice, Jennings's belief was that the essential function was the effective&#151;but principled&#151;management of the particular dispute, not an elegant restatement of the law. Although the practice of the International Court of Justice allows individual judges to append their own concurring or dissenting opinions to the judgment of the court, Jennings's sole voice was seldom heard; he was most often with the majority, and never sought to express a separate concurring opinion. He reserved his own voice for the few cases where he disagreed with his colleagues, most often because he suspected them of distorting sound judicial principle in order to reach a desired result, as in the highly controversial <i>Yakimetz</i>, <i>Nicaragua</i>, and <i>Lockerbie</i> cases. But the fact that he was so often with the majority made him available for the drafting committee, and he was much sought after in that role. It was as president that his powers of conciliation flowered, most notably in his adroit handling of the sensitive <i>Chad&#150;Libya boundary case</i>, which marked the first Libyan step towards normalizing its relations with the international community. It was Jennings who introduced the practice under which the president addressed the annual session of the UN general assembly on the year's work by the court, and he did so with a discreet shrewdness that dispelled at once the fear that it might become the occasion for attempts to politicize the court's judicial function. He held strongly to the value of institutional memberships as an aid to civilized living &#145;especially to be recommended&#146;, as he put it, &#145;at a time like the present which seems to be so good at cultivating loneliness&#146;  (Hopkins, 72), an aphorism he would have applied to states as much as to people.<br>
<br>Jennings's life is a story of the unforeseeable, even improbable, advance to high position and worldwide reputation of a straightforward man of simple origins. It illustrates that, even in inter-war Britain, movement across the social and intellectual classes was possible, given high ability and industry, the cachet of an ancient university, and&#151;at key moments&#151;patronage based on esteem, not rank. He died, at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 4 August 2004, and was buried as he wished in the churchyard in Grantchester, after a funeral service on 11 August for which he had left precise instructions, which conveyed his deep respect for language, liturgy, and music (and his equally deep detestation of fashionable &#145;improvements&#146; in any of them). He was survived by his wife, Christine, and their three children.<br>
