<span class="headword">Shaxton,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1556), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was a native of Norfolk and studied at Cambridge, where he proceeded BA in 1506 or 1507, MA in 1510, BTh in 1521, and DTh in 1531. He became a fellow of Gonville Hall. In 1520, before he took up controversial views, he became a university preacher and was licensed to preach anywhere in the British Isles.<h2>
<a name="Cambridgeevangelical"></a>Cambridge evangelical</h2>In the 1520s many members of Gonville Hall became deeply involved in the theological ferment developing at Cambridge. Certainly it was more likely that Shaxton's early interest in Lutheran ideas was spurred inside his own college rather than at any informal meetings that might have taken place at the White Horse tavern, whose importance has been overrated. Gonville Hall, with Pembroke and Peterhouse, had among its members men whom John Foxe termed &#145;the godly learned in Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.415), including Edward Crome (who was a fellow with Shaxton) and John Skip (later chaplain to Anne Boleyn). The royal physician William Butts (an influential advocate of reform at court) was also a Gonville man. Shaxton's devotion to his college remained a great constant throughout his life.<br>
<br>Shaxton was a prompt supporter of Henry VIII's divorce from Katherine of Aragon, and was one of Anne Boleyn's most important prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. In early 1530 Bishop Richard Nix of Norwich began to raise a new alarm about the growing availability of erroneous books, and in particular he complained of Gonville men who gave every appearance of holiness but in actuality savoured of heresy. Working in partnership with Archbishop William Warham and other conservative bishops Nix moved to suppress unorthodox preaching. Crome was among the first troubled in early 1531, but he was saved through Anne's influence, and by his own sophisticated aptitude for equivocating when tightly cornered, an ability Shaxton and many other reformers also cultivated. In August, Nix burnt Thomas Bilney (who had converted Hugh Latimer as well as many others at the university). His suspicions had also been aroused by Shaxton, who had been &#145;very sore suspected of many men&#146; for his sermons and possession of heretical books  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.680).<br>
<br>None of Shaxton's sermon notes survive, and for much of his career it is possible only to make inferences about the nature of his opinions. Certainly he stood with many of the early reformers in supporting the primacy of scripture, and in impugning traditional tenets including purgatory, and eventually transubstantiation. According to Nix's hostile description, Shaxton had preached <i>ad clerum</i> in Cambridge on Ash Wednesday 1531 that it was wrong to assert publicly that there was no purgatory, but not damnable to think so privately. Aghast, Nix (according to Foxe) is supposed to have said: &#145;Christ's Mother! I fear I have burnt Abel, and let Cain go!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.650). But Bilney's execution had shocked the university and its officers strove to prevent any further burnings. Vice-chancellor John Watson and his assistants were willing to argue Shaxton into compliance, and they had &#145;much ado to bring him to forsake&#146; his views. To avoid the scandal of an open abjuration Watson prepared a special oath for him and all candidates in theology to take, that they would never maintain or defend any errors by Wycliffe, Hus, or Luther  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.680). Eventually a panel of divines attested that they found Shaxton to be &#145;a good catholyke man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5, appx 17, no. 1). The following year, without too much publicity, Latimer also had to retract some of the positions he had preached.<h2>
<a name="Courtpreacherandbishop"></a>Court preacher and bishop</h2>In the fluid circumstances of these early years of doctrinal experimentation Shaxton's troubles only enhanced his reputation among other reformers, and by the beginning of 1534 he had risen to become Queen Anne's almoner. The court had rapidly become a testing ground for doctrinal change with Henry's supremacy over the English church. In Anne's evangelical household religious discussion was a fixture, especially at dinners, and the supreme head himself sometimes engaged in debates and arguments. During Lent 1534 Archbishop Thomas Cranmer introduced Shaxton (whom he accounted &#145;my old acquainted friend&#146;) and Latimer onto the court's preaching schedule, which may have been Shaxton's first formal speaking essay under the king's eye  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Writings</span>, 309). Some time later, teamed with Latimer, Shaxton entered into a debate against the king and Sir James Boleyn (the queen's uncle) on a question of scripture (possibly on purgatory) which was so spirited that Henry later wrote out &#145;dyverse epistelles&#146; on the matter  (&#145;William Latymer's chronicklle&#146;, 62).<br>
<br>Through Anne's influence Shaxton gained a series of ecclesiastical preferments, including a canonry in St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster. Early in 1535 he was made bishop of Salisbury (royal assent 5 March, temporalities restored 1 April, consecration 11 April), and Latimer was raised to Worcester when their Italian predecessors were deprived. Anne lent each of them &pound;200 to pay for their first fruits and tenths, which was still owed at her execution the following year. In May 1536, a few days after her death, Shaxton wrote to Thomas Cromwell in desperation, pleading with him to continue her work in advancing the honour of God and his holy word. Within his new diocese he was active in promoting the reading of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the vernacular, and was also a strong advocate of preaching. In Holbein's title-page for Coverdale's <span class="roman">Bible</span> of 1535, as well as the elaborate woodcut that graces the title-page of the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span> of 1539, Shaxton is portrayed standing shoulder to shoulder with his brother bishops Cranmer and Latimer as they receive holy scripture from the hand of the king.<br>
<br>Shaxton's reputation for advancing reform spread far beyond his own diocese. During the northern risings of the autumn of 1536 rebels cited him with the other bishops of recent promotion as having subverted the faith of Christ. The political realities of the later 1530s kept him (and all bishops) highly dependent upon the goodwill of Cromwell (especially in his capacity as vicegerent for spiritual matters), and ultimately, upon the king. But Shaxton's relations with Cromwell were continually strained. His letters never shared the confidence with which Latimer approached Cromwell, and his tenure as bishop was contentious even for a reformer, and probably high-handed. He quarrelled with the inhabitants of Salisbury as he tried to impose his authority over them, exacerbating long-term disagreements concerning episcopal influence over civic jurisdiction. They countered by calling him a heretic they trusted to see hanged. Eventually Cromwell complained that Shaxton had a stomach more meet for an emperor than a bishop. He had little credit left at court in 1539 when he proved unwilling to work for the passage of the six articles through parliament, in that dangerous period as Henry's tolerance for doctrinal innovation waned.<h2>
<a name="Marriageresignationandseclusion"></a>Marriage, resignation, and seclusion</h2>The cornerstone of the six articles was the act's defence of the mass and the real presence, and its tacit assumption that private masses assisted the departed in purgatory. Its promotion by the king was a setback for reformers. In addition Shaxton's reluctance to support the measure was probably dominated by an urgent personal factor, for some time before 1539 he had married. The act also prohibited clerical marriage and upheld vows of chastity, and lapses were considered felonies, punishable by death. As in the case of Cranmer, the details of Shaxton's marriage are almost completely shrouded in the obscurity that made the match possible. In his Ash Wednesday sermon of 1531 he had tested the issue of clerical celibacy by arguing that no man could maintain chastity only by prayer and fasting without God's help. In 1538 he tried to promote a married man as divinity lecturer at Reading Abbey, over the strenuous objections of the abbot. Although many reformers prompted Cromwell to permit clerical marriage, or secretly took wives, the issue remained clouded. Shaxton's marriage therefore had always represented a calculated risk, and from the passage of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> in 1539 it was a positive danger.<br>
<br>Shaxton and Latimer resigned their sees in July 1539. So shocking and unfamiliar did it seem for bishops to relinquish their dioceses that Shaxton had to ask Cromwell if he should still dress like a bishop, and Crome had to defend them in his London sermons against the hostile popular conclusion that they had surrendered their honour with their dignities. On the continent Melanchthon wrote to Henry in protest against the six articles and praised their bravery. For some months Shaxton was held in ward at Chew by Bishop John Clerk of Bath and Wells. In December he and Latimer were each granted an annuity of 100 marks.<br>
<br>Following his resignation Shaxton's career entered an almost complete eclipse. Initially his movements were restricted, and his preaching prohibited. By 1542, due to the good auspices of Cranmer, he obtained a haven at Hadleigh in Suffolk, an ecclesiastical peculiar belonging to the diocese of Canterbury. Foxe referred to Hadleigh as seeming more like &#145;a university of the learned&#146; than the clothmaking town it was in actuality  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 6.677), due in no small measure to the energy and effectiveness of its spiritual leaders, who included Bilney (who had preached there), Thomas Rose, and especially its rector, Rowland Taylor. In all likelihood Hadleigh's real circumstances may have been less glowing than Foxe would have his readers believe, for (as elsewhere) those townspeople sympathetic to reform probably constituted only a committed core among the rest. Nevertheless Shaxton could count upon those with connections to the archbishop's household, and Hadleigh provided an astonishing measure of security for his family. In 1539 Cranmer had very sensibly sent his wife, Margaret, for safety to her relatives on the continent, but neither Shaxton nor Taylor (who had also married before 1539 and served in Cranmer's employ) seem to have followed his example. Shaxton and his wife had at least three children.<h2>
<a name="Recantation"></a>Recantation</h2>Shaxton's next crisis occurred in 1546, when intense new struggles over doctrine developed in the waning months of the king's life. In April, Crome embarked on a series of London sermons that implicitly attacked the six articles by impugning the efficacy of votive masses, which could not, he argued, relieve the souls of the dead. As Crome came under heavy pressure to recant Shaxton and Latimer came to his aid, urging him not to retract his opinions. And Shaxton backed Crome with a sermon of his own in London at the beginning of June, denying the presence of Christ's body in the sacrament of the altar. Conservative opponents used this controversy to initiate a purge of reformers at court and in many parts of the country.<br>
<br>Shaxton was arrested and condemned to be burnt. Then a panel of theologians was sent to persuade him, with even greater success than in 1531. He accepted the six articles with no further reservations, and wrote an abject letter of apology to the king. As part of his submission he was sent to persuade Anne Askew, who had similarly denied the real presence. She told him that &#145;it had been good for him never to have been born&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.547), and he presided when she was burnt with three others in Smithfield on 16 July. Two weeks later he appeared at Paul's Cross to recant formally, weeping copiously for his errors. It was about this time that he put away his wife. In November his reconciliation to the regime became complete when the king gave him a new licence to preach.<br>
<br>From 1546 Shaxton's alienation from reform was total. He never retracted this recantation, he never apologized to his former allies, he was not reconciled with his wife, and he remained conservative in opinion for the rest of his life. Under Edward VI he seemed like a dangerous backslider to the new protestant regime, and he was the focus of many vituperative printed attacks, by John Bale (who said he fell from Christ) among others. The most damaging one, edited by Robert Crowley, carried an anonymous letter of criticism by Taylor, and even the simple rhyming admonition against sexual incontinence that Shaxton had written to his wife when he had separated from her.<blockquote>
<div>Voyde euil thoughtes, studie in scripture<br>
</div>
<div>Kepe thine eye, ill company eschue<br>
</div>
<div>Least delite and desire them do ensue.<br>
</div> (Crowley, sig. A4<i>r</i>)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Under Mary, Shaxton's position improved. In 1555 he received a pardon from Cardinal Reginald Pole for his illicit marriage and the heresies he had encouraged under Henry VIII. In the same year he became suffragan to Bishop Thomas Thirlby of Ely. Again he acted as examiner, and tried to persuade others to follow his example. &#145;Good brethren&#146;, he counselled William Wolsey and Robert Pygot of Wisbech in a futile effort to keep them from the stake, &#145;remember yourselves, and become new men, for I myself was in this fond opinion that you are now in, but I am now become a new man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.404). At Cambridge the university's habitual protectiveness ensured that there was only one execution there, at Easter 1556 of John Hullier, whose examination Shaxton led at Great St Mary's Church. To protestants these martyrdoms amplified the irony of Shaxton's apostasy.<br>
<br>Gonville Hall figured large in Shaxton's will of 5 August 1556, along with a weighty secret. His final benefactions to the college included his books, the hangings of green say in his chamber, and a house in Cambridge that he was in the midst of buying at the time of his death. Its income he wanted used &#145;to solace the compagnie at home&#146; each Christmas. And he instructed his Hadleigh servant Thomas Alabaster to ensure that the residue of his estate was to go to one Thomas Dartsab, the curious name (bastard spelled backwards) hinting at the desperate and even poignant contrivances necessary to cope with the embarrassing fact that the one-time bishop had a son. His two daughters, perhaps already married to Hadleigh men and provided for, were not mentioned. Shaxton had died by 9 August, when his will was proved, and according to his wishes his body was interred in the chapel of Gonville Hall. In modern times the college has reinvigorated his bequest in the form of a holiday dinner for the fellows and their spouses.<br>
