<span class="headword">Shore <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lambert]</span>,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Jane]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1526/7?), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was the daughter of John Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1487), citizen and mercer of London, and Amy (<i>d</i>. 1488), daughter of Robert Marshall, citizen and grocer of London. She married William Shore (<i>d</i>. 1494), a London mercer, but the marriage was annulled in 1476, at her petition, on the grounds of his impotence. The main source for her relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8520/', "Edward IV")</script> is Thomas More, who is responsible (in his <span class="italic">History of Richard III</span>) for the story that Edward claimed to have three concubines: the merriest, the wiliest, and the holiest harlot in his realm. &#145;Shore's wife&#146; (the name Jane was attached to her by the dramatist Thomas Heywood in 1599) was the merriest; in More's words: &#145;a proper wit had she, &amp; could both rede wel &amp; write, mery in company, redy &amp; quick of aunswer, neither mute nor ful of bable, sometime taunting without displesure &amp; not without disport&#146;. More continued with a famous tribute:<blockquote>For many he had, but her he loved, whose favour to saithe trouth &hellip; she never abused to any mans hurt, but to many a mans comfort. &hellip; And finally in many weighty sutes, she stode many men in gret stede, either for none, or very smal rewardes, &amp; those rather gay then rich: either for that she was content with the dede selfe well done, or for that she delited to be suid unto, &amp; to show what she was able to do wyth the king &hellip; (More, 56)</blockquote>Perhaps predictably, no source from Edward's reign names Elizabeth Shore as a royal mistress, but she does enter the historical record in the next reign. The king's death on 9 April 1483 apparently left her in need of a new protector, and a contemporary reference casts Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset in that role. In October 1483, when he was in rebellion against Richard III, he was accused of holding &#145;the unshameful and mischievous woman called Shore's wife in adultery&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1476&#150;85</i>, 371). The great chronicle of London and Thomas More, by contrast, link her instead with Edward's friend and chamberlain William, Lord Hastings. According to the <span class="italic">Great Chronicle</span>, she was called to answer for some of Hastings's goods after his death in June 1483 and her own goods were attached by the sheriffs of London. She was also put to public penance &#145;for the lyfe that she ledd with the said lord hastyngys and othir grete astatys&#146;  (Thomas and Thornley, 233). More's account of that penance is another famous set piece: &#145;In which she went in countenance &amp; pace demure so womanly, &amp; albeit she were out of al array save her kyrtle only: yet went she so fair &amp; lovely &hellip; that her great shame wan her much praise&#146;  (More, 54&#150;5).<br>
<br>The claimed association of Elizabeth Shore with Hastings led some later historians to argue that she was an intermediary in a Woodville&#150;Hastings plot against Richard, duke of Gloucester, in June 1483. There is no contemporary support for the claim, and More himself, the source for the story, explicitly dismisses it as an implausible fiction put about by Gloucester. Elizabeth was, however, in political trouble of some sort after Edward's death, and was imprisoned in Ludgate at the commandment of Richard III, as Gloucester became. This is made clear by an undated letter from Richard to the bishop of Lincoln, announcing that the king's solicitor, Thomas Lynom, had contracted matrimony with her, being &#145;merveillously blynded and abused&#146;  (Horrox and Hammond, 3.259). The king hoped that the bishop might be able to talk him out of his infatuation but, failing that, Elizabeth was to be released from gaol if she could find sureties for her good behaviour and given into her father's keeping until the king's return to London. Lynom evidently remained unmoved by episcopal argument, for the will of Elizabeth's father, made in September 1487, makes it clear that the two had married. Elizabeth was bequeathed a bed of arras and (rather pointedly, perhaps) a painted cloth of Mary Magdalen and Martha. Lynom managed to transfer his services to the Tudors and was active on the Welsh border under Henry VII and in the early years of Henry VIII. He was a councillor of Prince Arthur and controller of the rolls of his household.<br>
<br>Lynom was dead by 29 July 1518, and this perhaps provides the context for More's description of Elizabeth fallen into penury in her old age. But More's claim that she had to resort to begging seems overdrawn, particularly if the Thomas Lynom who was active in Wales after 1518 was her son. No definite identification of her children can, however, be made. Her father's will mentions a Julian Lynom, bequeathed 40<i>s</i>., who was perhaps the first child of the marriage, but he cannot be traced. It is not known exactly when Elizabeth died. More writes of her as still alive, though very old, when he was composing his <span class="italic">History of Richard III</span> in the second decade of the sixteenth century; a variant text of the <span class="italic">History</span> states that she died in the eighteenth year of Henry VIII (1526/1527). Though not implausible, the date cannot be proved. As Jane Shore she enjoyed a considerable literary afterlife, as the subject of poems, ballads, and plays; the most notable of the latter was Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Jane Shore</span>, first produced in 1714. She also appears in a number of historical novels.<br>
