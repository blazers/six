<span class="headword">Codrington,  Robert</span>  (1601/2&#150;1665?), <span class="occ">translator and writer</span>, was the second son of Robert Codrington (<i>b</i>. 1573/4?) of Coddrington, Gloucestershire. Elected a demy or scholar of Magdalen College, Oxford, on 29 July 1619, he matriculated on 26 June 1621, aged nineteen, graduated BA on 18 February 1623, and proceeded MA on 27 June 1626. According to Anthony Wood he then travelled before settling in Norfolk, where he lived as a gentleman for several years and married; his wife's name is unknown. Later he moved to London, and may have been the Robert Coddrington who, with his wife, &#145;Haveningam&#146; (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Heveningham?), presented their son Robert for baptism at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 9 November 1635.<br>
<br>The previous year Codrington began what was to be a thirty-year career of publishing translations from French, Latin, and Spanish, and occasional works of his own. Historical biography was a notable feature, but the context of and motivation for publication is unclear: all his works contained hopeful dedications, but usually to people with whom he claimed no prior acquaintance, and in which he revealed no personal details. The anti-Catholic <span class="italic">The Elegant Combat</span> (1634), describing the confrontation between leading Huguenot minister and Anglophile Pierre du Moulin and Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac, and dedicated to Sir Anthony Mildmay, was complemented by a translation from du Moulin, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Knowledge of God</span> (1634), addressed to the countess of Derby, as a well-known patron of learning. The following year he issued <span class="italic">L. A. Seneca the Philosopher, his Booke of Consolation to Marcia &hellip; in an English Poem</span>. He seems to have had at least a tenuous connection with the royal court, for the subject of his <span class="italic">An Elegie to the Immortall Memory &hellip; of Margaret Lady Smith</span> (1637) was one of the queen's gentlewomen; the dedicatee, her last husband, Edward Savage, was a gentleman of the king's privy chamber. By 1641 Codrington claimed to have written &#145;many hundred&#146; poems. That spring he was imprisoned by parliament because of one interpreted as overly sympathetic to the earl of Strafford. Writing on 24 May to Sir Edward Dering, MP for Kent, with a plea for mercy for the unintentional offence, Codrington, lame and consumptive, made much of the suffering of his wife and children and of the &#145;many noble familyes, to whom I neerely am allyed&#146; who &#145;bleed in my wounds&#146;, and protested that &#145;there was never a more hopefull parliament than this, never an assembly of more able and more excellent men in a more needfull time, for establishing of the kingdome&#146;  (Larking, 50&#150;51). His release seems to have soon followed.<br>
<br>Wood thought Codrington a puritan and a parliamentarian. His writings reveal a commitment to protestantism, but it is difficult to discern a more precise religious or political stance. His <span class="italic">The Memorialls of Margaret de Valoys</span>, the first edition of which was published in 1641 with a dedication to Surrey gentleman Sir Anthony Vincent, was presented as the queen of Navarre's own account of courtly intrigue during the French wars of religion; new editions with almost identically worded dedications to (respectively) John Cecil, earl of Exeter, and George Meryfield appeared in 1647 and 1650. However, <span class="italic">The History of the most Illustrious Lady Queen Margaret</span> (1649), based on the same text and dedicated to Sir Horatio Townshend of Raynham, Norfolk, pointedly referred in the subtitle to its representation of &#145;the Bloody Massacre [of St Bartholomew's day] and the growth and fury of the Civill War in that Kingdome, occasioned by the policy and ambition of the Catholic Nobility, and by the pernicious Counsell of some Bishops&#146;. If this had been his conscious theme all along then his translation of a manifesto published in Paris on 24 April 1642, issued as <span class="italic">A Declaration Sent to the King of France and Spayne from the Catholiques or Rebells in Ireland</span> (1642), was clearly meant to draw parallels between the conflicts in late sixteenth-century France and contemporary Britain: in this work the Irish Catholics who sought to subvert and convert susceptible protestants and to obtain foreign support emerged as latter-day equivalents of the Guise-led leaguers. <span class="italic">The Life and Death of the Illustrious Robert, Earl of Essex</span> (1646), a derivative work dedicated to Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, portrayed a protestant general (and son of another), following his death on 24 September 1646.<br>
<br>Codrington's subsequent output was more varied. <span class="italic">The Troublesome and Hard Adventures in Love</span> (1652), derived from Miguel de Cervantes and dedicated to James Compton, earl of Northampton, himself a translator, was followed by <span class="italic">The Ten Books of Quintus Curtius Rufus: Containing, the Life and Death of Alexander the Great</span> (1652), dedicated to Baptist Hicks, Viscount Campden; verses, <span class="italic">The Dimension of the Hollow Tree on Hampstead</span> (1653) and a &#145;corrected and revived&#146; edition of Ludovick Lloyd's <span class="italic">The Marrow of History, or, The Pilgrimage of Kings and Princes</span> (1653), were dedicated to Charles Dimmock. There were further translations: from Marguerite de Valois, <span class="italic">Heptameron, or, The History of the Fortunate Lovers</span> (1654, dedicated to Thomas Stanley) and <span class="italic">The Grand Cabinet-Counsels Unlocked</span> (1658, dedicated to William Basset of Claverton, Somerset); from Justinus's Roman history, dedicated fulsomely to Oliver Cromwell (1654); and from Savoy Chapel minister Jean d'Espagne, <span class="italic">Shibboleth, Observations of Severall Errors in the Last Translations of the English &amp; French Bibles</span> (1655).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Codrington published <span class="italic">Ten Sermons</span> (1660), originally delivered in Latin at Oxford in 1647 by Robert Sanderson, one of the few Calvinists among the newly appointed bishops. In contrast was his 1662 English version of George Ruggles's Latin play, <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span>. In <span class="italic">The Prophecies of Christopher Kotterus</span> (1664), dedicated to Prince Rupert, Codrington revived predictions of &#145;the sudden destruction of the Popish Religion in the year 1666, presaging the uniting of all Religions into one visible Church, and how that Church shall be Governed by Bishops&#146;, while in <span class="italic">His Majesties Propriety and Dominion on the Brittish Seas Asserted</span> (1665), dedicated to the earl of Albemarle, he made a timely patriotic attack on the &#145;insupportable insolencies&#146; of the Dutch. He also contributed the French and Latin sections of Francis Barlow's <span class="italic">Aesops Fables with his Life</span> (1666), collaborated on an edition of Thomas Hawkins's <span class="italic">The Holy Court</span>, and added to some editions of Francis Hawkins's <span class="italic">Youths Behaviour</span> a complementary <span class="italic">Youths Behaviour, or, Decency in Conversation amongst Women</span> (1664), which dealt with issues as diverse as preserving, obedience to parents, and sleep, and <span class="italic">A Collection of Select Proverbs &hellip; out of Several Languages</span> (1664).<br>
<br>According to Wood, Codrington died of the plague in London in 1665. That is the year of first appearance of his final publication, although many of his works were reissued. The &#145;second addition&#146; of <span class="italic">Youths Behaviour &hellip; amongst Women</span>, with a title-page dated 1672 but with the imprimatur of 12 November 1663 and reference to addition &#145;this Year 1663&#146;, has a dedication by Codrington to Ellinor Pargiter and her daughter Elizabeth Washington dated &#145;Feb. 10. 66&#146;, but this may be a misprint.<br>
