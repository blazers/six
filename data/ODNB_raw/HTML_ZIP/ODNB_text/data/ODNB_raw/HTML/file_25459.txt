<span class="headword">Short,  James</span>  (1710&#150;1768), <span class="occ">maker of optical instruments</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 10 June 1710, the son of William Short, a wright, and his wife, Margaret Grierson; he was supposedly named after James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender. Following his parents' deaths he was accepted as a pupil in George Heriot's Hospital on 18 April 1720, and then at the age of twelve transferred to the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he showed considerable ability in the classics. After matriculating in 1726 at Edinburgh University, he followed the arts courses but did not graduate. A pious grandmother had prevailed on him to enter the church, so he studied divinity and is said to have passed his trials for the ministry in 1731. However, he was inspired by the lectures of Colin MacLaurin, professor of mathematics at the university, to abandon divinity for mathematics and astronomy.<br>
<br>Under MacLaurin's guidance and friendship Short developed an interest in astronomical optics, and used his friend's rooms for early attempts at making telescopes in 1732. Soon he improved the metallic specula prescribed by Newton for the reflecting telescope, and, having mastered the art of grinding and polishing parabolic mirrors, he was making sophisticated instruments of several different sizes by 1734. He was far excelling other makers, according to MacLaurin, who drew the Royal Society's attention to his talent in 1735. Tests of his instruments followed in 1736, and that summer in London he instructed William, duke of Cumberland, in mathematics. His skills as a maker were recognized by his election to the Royal Society on 24 March 1737. The annular eclipse of 1737 and a comet that year stimulated astronomical activity in MacLaurin's circle and helped lead to the formation of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, of which Short was a founder member and the only one engaged in trade. Through the society's concentration of the professional and landed classes, Short found patronage for his telescopes and participated in astronomical observations. He enjoyed the particular favour of Lord Aberdour, later the earl of Morton, for whom he carried out survey work on his Orkney lands in 1739, and both made and repaired instruments. He also executed a model straw cutting machine in 1742 to satisfy Morton's agricultural interests, and made astronomical observations with him.<br>
<br>Short produced about 180 telescopes in Edinburgh before moving to London in April 1738, no doubt attracted by its wider horizons as a leading centre of European science. His earnings in Scotland had been considerable as early as 1736, when he acquired &pound;3000 Scots of Bank of Scotland stock. The earl of Buchan stated that he banked &pound;500 profit by the time he left Scotland, when he sensibly appointed a factor to look after his Scottish finances. His business acumen was considerable, for he continued to prosper in London as a pre-eminent maker of a range of sizes of reflecting telescopes, charging double his rivals' prices. His output from his workshop in Surrey Street, Strand, was exceptionally specialized but it was steady, and he made about 1370 reflecting telescopes in all.<br>
<br>Short's British reputation was quickly established and spread wider as scientists and academics across Europe sought him out. Among his commissioned instruments was one of an 18 inch aperture for the king of Spain, completed in 1752 and costing &pound;1200. An instrument for Uppsala gained for him the rare distinction of foreign membership of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1758. Such honours mattered to him, for he successfully applied to the University of St Andrews for the degree of MA in 1753. His instrument sales were helped by the vogue for astronomical observations among gentlemen and academic scientists, with whom he frequently made observations, notably during the transit of Venus in 1761, when he was one of the Royal Society's observers and supplied instruments. Interest in this event generated commissions in anticipation of the 1769 transit. As an active member of the society, Short communicated many of his observations from 1736 until 1763, including his calculation of solar parallax from the 1761 transit, which was long accepted. He occasionally assessed others' contributions.<br>
<br>Short numbered London's leading instrument makers among his friends. He made observations with George Graham, and early encouraged John Dollond's improvements to the achromatic refracting telescope which ultimately provided instruments to rival his own. An interest in calculating longitude led to his appointment in 1763 to the parliamentary committee to test a timekeeper devised by John Harrison, with whom he became friends. He may have penned an anonymous account of Harrison's work printed that year. His support for Harrison's claim to the longitude prize seems to have caused his patron Lord Morton, then president of the Royal Society, to oppose his candidature for the post of astronomer royal in 1764, though he reportedly acknowledged Short's superior qualifications. Short's criticisms of observations at Greenwich perhaps contributed to his failure to gain the office.<br>
<br>Before the rift with his patron, Short was a friend to the family and an occasional agent in its affairs. This reflected his links with other Scots in London, and his continuing ties to Scotland, where his brother Thomas traded as an instrument maker in Leith, and from whence he derived income from his stock and personal loans, as well as the occasional commission. In London, as well as his social connections through the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Arts, of which he was a founder in 1754, Short was friendly with migrant Scots [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94594', "Founders of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce")</script>]. It was to him that James Watt carried an introduction in 1755, and through him found employment. David Hume joked in 1759 that Short was secretly married to a Miss Elliot, who with her sister ran the respectable boarding house where Hume and other Scots stayed, though it is known that he died unmarried.<br>
<br>Short remained active until his death from a disease of the bowel, which occurred on 15 June 1768, at his lodgings at Newington Butts near London. His business was continued by his brother Thomas Short from 1768 until 1776, when he returned to Edinburgh. James Short left most of his considerable fortune derived from his skill at polishing metal mirrors to his nephew, as well as bequests to friends. Among them was Lady Mary Douglas, Lord Morton's eldest surviving daughter, to whom he left &pound;1000 and the reversion of his estate, which may have amounted to as much as &pound;20,000.<br>
