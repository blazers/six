<span class="headword">Hillier,  George Alexander</span>  (1815&#150;1866), <span class="occ">antiquary and publisher</span>, was born in Kennington, Surrey, the son of William Hillier, commander RN, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1862). He was educated at Place Street House Academy, Ryde, Isle of Wight  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and it is known that he lived afterwards at 3 Crescent Place, Mornington Crescent, London, and Sedley Lodge, Ryde, Isle of Wight. In 1847 he was granted permission to make drawings from manuscripts in the British Museum and collected material relating to the Isle of Wight. He was commissioned to research into the history of a number of aristocratic families both in the British Museum and in their own archives. From 1853 he sold manuscripts to the British Museum but their quantity and quality aroused the suspicions of Sir Frederic Madden, keeper of manuscripts. Hillier could not demonstrate title, and some may indeed have been forgeries. In 1854 he was suspended, and despite threats it was felt expedient to keep the affair out of the gaze of the law courts and the public  (Hockey).<br>
<br>Despite such setbacks Hillier was actively publishing. <span class="italic">The Topography of the Isle of Wight</span> appeared in 1850 and ran to several editions over the next few years. He published four historical works, <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Attempted Escapes of Charles the First from Carisbrook Castle</span> (1852), <span class="italic">The Sieges of Arundel Castle</span> (1854), <span class="italic">A Memorial of the Castle at Carisbrook</span> (1855), and <span class="italic">The Stranger's Guide to the Town of Reading, with a History of the Abbey</span> (1859).<br>
<br>Hillier also carried out archaeological investigations which he published as <span class="italic">Result of the Excavations on Brighstone and Bowcombe Downs, Isle of Wight, August 1854</span> (1854) and subsequently in the <span class="italic">Journal of the British Archaeological Association</span> (vol. 9, 1855, pp. 34&#150;40). In 1855 he excavated an early Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Chessell Down  (Arnold, <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries of the Isle of Wight</span>), which attracted considerable antiquarian attention and acclaim. Further controversy ensued after he sold the artefacts to Lord Londesborough, but subsequently pledged them to a Dorset pawnbroker. In 1867 they were acquired by the British Museum, some from Charles Warne, another Dorset antiquary who had employed Hillier as an illustrator.<br>
<br>One obituarist implies that throughout this period Hillier suffered financial problems and a breakdown  (<span class="italic">GM</span>); his difficulties were exacerbated by the lack of subscribers to his projected &#145;History and antiquities of the Isle of Wight&#146;, which was never completed. The only finished section surveyed the archaeology and history of the Isle of Wight to the medieval period and was illustrated with his own hand-coloured engravings, notably of his discoveries at Chessell Down. The second section, a study of the borough of Newport, finished in mid-sentence after only thirty-two pages.<br>
<br>Hillier died on 1 April 1866 in Ryde and was buried at Binstead church, Isle of Wight. The lease of their property was transferred to his wife, Marie, as he died &#145;without leaving any property for her maintenance&#146;  (Isle of Wight RO, uncatalogued draft leases).<br>
<br>For his time Hillier was an accomplished excavator whose detailed records have fortunately survived. In his latter years he had enjoyed considerable support from noted antiquaries&#151;hence his glowing entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>&#151;but they were probably unaware of the questionable side of Hillier's life, about which equally influential individuals preferred to remain silent.<br>
