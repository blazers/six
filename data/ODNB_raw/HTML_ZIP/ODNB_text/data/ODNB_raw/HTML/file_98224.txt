<span class="headword">Saunders,  Alan</span>  (1886&#150;1964), <span class="occ">colonial police officer</span>, was born at 12 Princes Square, Paddington, London, on 26 August 1886, the younger of two sons (there were also at least two daughters) of Alfred Dann Saunders, formerly of Bombay, company secretary, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibson. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, which moved from central London to Horsham in Sussex while he was a pupil there. In 1908 he joined the Indian police and served in India until the First World War, when he fought in France and Flanders, before heading to Palestine, being present at General Allenby's entry into Jerusalem in 1917. He held the rank of colonel and was mentioned in dispatches three times and wounded twice. In 1920 Saunders married Eva Helen (<i>d</i>. 1952), daughter of Charles Worsley Strickland, inspector-general of the Egyptian customs administration. They had one son.<br>
<br>Saunders was involved in policing in Palestine from the beginnings of the British mandate; when the first unified police force was instituted in 1920 he was made district commandant of Jerusalem district. He was promoted to deputy commandant (later deputy inspector of police) in 1926, the year the Palestine police force (PPF) formally came into being. This promotion was no surprise; against a backdrop of a high turnover of staff Saunders represented continuity, while his open-mindedness, consideration for others, and extensive knowledge of Palestine helped ensure that, although he was less versed in media presentation than some, he was later to become the most popular of all inspectors among PPF officers. His quietly spoken manner belied an austere imperialism and a belief in clean living and the virtues of work and self-improvement.<br>
<br>Many British members in the PPF would look back on the 1920s as something of a halcyon period; the (relative) peace and quiet of Saunders's Palestine career was broken in August 1929 with the rioting of Arabs near Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, Hebron, and Safad. Saunders was in charge of policing while the commandant, Arthur Mavrogordato, was absent on leave. The riots took Saunders&#151;and most other Britons administering the mandate&#151;by surprise, but he acted quickly, organizing specials drawn from civil service departments and resident British civilians to patrol the centre of Jerusalem. However, he realized when the problem had become too great for the police to handle, and passed control of the situation over to the military. Although praised by the subsequent commission into the riots, he regretted not sending a sufficient number of relief constables to Hebron, where an inexperienced young superintendent, Raymond Cafferata, had to attempt to halt the slaughter of Jews aided only by a poor-quality police force. While most historians argue that Cafferata and some Arab families saved the lives of many Jews by placing them in hiding, 59 were killed; in total 133 Jews and 116 Arabs died across Palestine as a result of the disturbances. Nevertheless, Saunders was awarded the king's police medal in 1929. He was also made OBE in 1932, and CMG in 1941.<br>
<br>Saunders illustrates the argument that in the inter-war period Palestine replaced Ireland as &#145;<i>the</i> unofficial training and recruiting ground for senior colonial policemen&#146;  (Sinclair, 115). His first African posting came in February 1936, when he became inspector-general of the Nigeria police force. Coming as he did from one of the most efficient of all colonial police forces, Saunders was shocked by the Nigeria force, and set to reforming it in a variety of ways. As a firm believer in hierarchy and the notion of the police as a force of unimpeachable moral authority, he saw to it, for instance, that senior non-commissioned officers stopped spending their evenings socializing with the rank and file. He was a stickler for standards of dress: &#145;Nothing looks more &#147;unpolicemanlike&#148; than slacks which, owing to heat and damp, become baggy at the knees&#146;  (Bodl. RH, MS Afr. s. 1827(1)/18). In the sixteen months in which he was inspector he issued orders with such impulsion that on more than one occasion he was asked to issue a retraction where differences emerged from the policies issued by the governor, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. Saunders did, however, successfully increase the size of the force's CID, and modernized the criminal record system by bringing it in line with that used in Palestine. He also spent time ensuring that the Nigeria police force's Christmas card was appropriately seasonal.<br>
<br>After leave Saunders returned to Palestine in November 1937 as inspector-general of the police and prisons. He rejoined at a difficult time; the Arab revolt had recently resumed, and a lack of police meant that the British frequently lost control of large swathes of the mandate. The PPF was switching decisively towards a focus on military, rather than civil, duties, and was increasingly relying on torture to extract information from Arab prisoners  (Hughes, 23). In spite of difficulties with Arab policemen, some of whom were feeding information to rebels, Saunders resisted their being sacked, fearing that this would drive them &#145;lock, stock and barrel&#146; into the hands of guerrillas  (Smith, 69). The PPF had several persistent problems besides understaffing, most notably the quality of intelligence and mobility. In addressing these difficulties Saunders could claim a fair amount of success. He improved the working relationship between patrols and CID and, besides doubling the British contingent of mounted police, established a 500-strong mobile police striking force in 1940 to act as a rapid response unit. Nevertheless, tempers flared, and Lieutenant-General Robert Haining, the commanding officer in Palestine, openly, though unsuccessfully, lobbied London for Saunders's removal from office; Saunders himself complained about the quality of his men, particularly those who had been drafted in to help put down the Arab revolt.<br>
<br>Saunders left Palestine in August 1943, before Zionist terrorism became widespread. On his retirement from the colonial service he became chief police adviser at the allied military headquarters in Greece in 1944, the director of middle east censorship between 1945 and 1946, and then, from 1946, commissioner of police in Tripolitania, Tripoli, north Africa. He finally retired in 1952, and lived at Windlesham, Surrey, and then in south Devon, where he died at his home, Rock Hill, Thurlestone, on 26 March 1964.<br>
