<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span>  (1691&#150;1766), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born on 23 June 1691, the son of a drayman of Nicholson's brewery in All Hallows parish in the City of London. He attended a parish school, and was admitted, at Nicholson's expense, to Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 11 March 1702, and to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 22 January 1709. He graduated BA in 1713, was placed in the <i>ordo senioritatis</i>, and proceeded MA in 1717 and DD in 1728, when he was also incorporated at Oxford. He was ordained deacon on 23 May 1714, and priest on 26 February 1716.<br>
<br>About 1720 Thomas accepted the post of chaplain to the English factory, the merchant community, in Hamburg. He was a popular clergyman, and his knowledge of German and publication of a German newspaper attracted the attention of George II during his visits to Hanover. The king preferred Thomas to the living of St Vedast, Foster Lane, London, in 1736, against strong ministerial objections, in order to ensure his attendance as a royal chaplain in 1737, on a similar visit to Hanover. In 1740 George II offered him the vacant deanery of Peterborough, though the duke of Newcastle had offered it to another. At Peterborough he was an active member of both the Peterborough and the Spalding societies. In 1742 he married the niece of Bishop Sherlock of London, the first of four wives about whom little is known. A year later he was nominated to the diocese of St Asaph, but when a vacancy occurred immediately afterwards at Lincoln he asked to be consecrated to that see instead as he hated the prospect of the journey from Wales to London. In 1761 he was appointed to the diocese of Salisbury.<br>
<br>In spite of his easy elevation within the church as a royal favourite Thomas was a conscientious bishop. He took care in examining candidates for holy orders. He was also a celebrated preacher. Thomas's less attractive features included the entertainment he derived from teasing clergymen that he intended to promote them. He also adopted a casual approach to marriage, joking that he had driven his first three wives to their deaths by his refusal to argue with them. The motto, or posy, on the wedding ring at his fourth marriage was: &#145;if I survive I'll make them five&#146;  (Cassan, part 3, 315).<br>
<br>Thomas was an amiable man. His tact may be judged from his ability to dine with the prince of Wales without offending the prince's estranged father, George II. Thomas's deafness and squint did not inhibit his gregariousness. He embodied the latitudinarian regard for compassion above dogma, on one occasion likening a Lutheran minister who would not bury a Calvinist to a woman parishioner of his who had complained that he had buried a man with the pox next to her husband. He is also credited with an emotional charity sermon, imploring his congregation not to let the children perish, and with devoting a tenth of his income to the repair of Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Bishop Thomas died on 20 July 1766 at the bishop's place, Salisbury, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>John Thomas was also instrumental in the brief revival of support for the Moravian church in Britain in the 1740s. While in Germany he had met Daniel Jablonski, and was convinced that he was the successor to the Bohemian episcopate. In 1746 Thomas attended Count Zinzendorf's sermons in London. During the debate on the bill to give legal recognition to the Moravian church in 1748&#150;9 Thomas argued that their episcopal orders and ordinations were valid. He also acted as an intermediary between Zinzendorf and Bishop Thomas Sherlock of London, whom he converted to a supporter of the Moravian cause. However, within four years of the passage of the <span class="roman">Moravian Act</span> of 1749 Thomas had become disaffected to the Morvains, shocked by rumours and allegations that they regarded the Holy Spirit as female and that they blessed genitalia in marriage ceremonies. Bishop Thomas should be carefully distinguished from two of his fellow bishops of the same name, one of whom also occupied the see of Salisbury.<br>
