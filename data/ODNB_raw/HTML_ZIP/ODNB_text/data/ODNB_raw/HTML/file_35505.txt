<span class="headword">Philip, Sir  Robert William</span>  (1857&#150;1939), <span class="occ">physician and founder of tuberculosis dispensaries</span>, was born at Govan, Glasgow, on 29 December 1857, the youngest son of George Philip, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland, whose charge was Union Church, Govan, and his wife, Margaret Josephine, daughter of Joseph Robertson. In 1866 his father was transferred to St John's Free Church in Edinburgh, and Philip was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and at Edinburgh University, where he took an arts MA degree before graduating MB, CM, with honours, in 1882.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1882&#150;3 Philip travelled to Leipzig and Vienna to undertake postgraduate work in embryology and gynaecology. He arrived in Vienna shortly after Robert Koch announced the discovery of the tubercle bacillus, and Philip took the opportunity to review Koch's work and to see the bacillus for himself. After returning to Edinburgh in 1883, he set about establishing himself in medical practice. In the same year he was house physician to John Wyllie at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; in 1885 he became assistant physician to the New Town Dispensary; and in 1887 he was appointed assistant to the professor of medicine at the university, Thomas Grainger Stewart, and also examiner in medicine and pathology at the University of Aberdeen. He retained his interest in tuberculosis and embarked on a series of investigations that he wrote up into a thesis entitled &#145;A study in phthisis, etiological and therapeutic&#146;, which in 1887 earned him the Edinburgh University MD degree and gold medal. His research was inspired by Koch's work, which to Philip's mind had profound implications for how tuberculosis was to be understood. Hitherto it had been regarded as a loose grouping of distinct if morphologically similar local lesions, whose causes were chiefly hereditary. By contrast the discovery of the tubercle bacillus implied that the various local affectations&#151;of the lungs, the joints, and various tissues&#151;were all aetiologically identical and should be attributed to a transmissible agent rather than a hereditary taint. Philip went on to hypothesize that the localized effects of the disease were only secondary manifestations of a systemic infection, the morbid effects of which were due primarily to the production and circulation of toxic bacterial waste-products. His experimental investigations, which involved making chemical preparations of tuberculous sputum and injecting them into rabbits and other animals, provided evidence in support of this theory.<br>
<br>Philip's views on the aetiology of tuberculosis, coupled with his exposure to the large numbers of tuberculous patients who attended the New Town Dispensary, convinced him that far more could be done to combat the disease, which was coming to be regarded as a major public health problem. Consequently in 1887, with the financial assistance of a number of his friends, he opened the Victoria Dispensary for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, initially located in three rooms of a flat at 13 Bank Street, Edinburgh. Among his supporters was his fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1937), youngest daughter of John Fenton Motherwell, of co. Sligo, whom he married in 1888. As with his research for his MD degree, the methods Philip developed at the Victoria Dispensary were informed by his understanding that tuberculosis was both a transmissible and a systemic disease. Therapeutically he had little time for methods of treatment which focused on the local lesions, for instance the surgical extirpation of tuberculous joints or the later development of artificial pneumothorax. Rather he argued that the best way to treat tuberculosis patients was to build up their general constitution and thus enable them to resist the infection: fresh air, clean surroundings, a nutritious diet, &#145;physiological rest&#146;, and careful exercise were all indicated. Consequently the dispensary employed nurse visitors to attend patients at home and advise on such matters as cleanliness, diet, and regimen. Moreover, Philip was strongly of the opinion that the disease could be treated most effectively if it was caught early in its development. As he regarded the home as the main site of transmission, he used home visits as an opportunity to search out other cases by lining up contacts and examining them for signs of the disease&#151;a procedure he liked to call a &#145;march past&#146;.<br>
<br>The dispensary was successful in attracting both patients and philanthropic funding, and in 1891 it moved to larger premises at 26 Lauriston Place, near to the Royal Infirmary and the medical school. Accommodation was now provided for an extensive outpatient practice, including waiting rooms, consulting rooms, and a laboratory. Between thirty and eighty patients would routinely be seen in an afternoon, and the medical officer made about 140 home visits each month. The dispensary thus provided a site from which to extend systematic medical surveillance and supervision into patients' homes. It also subsequently came to serve as a centre around which provision of other medical services could be organized and co-ordinated. In 1894 the Victoria Hospital for Consumption was opened at Craigleith, to provide institutional treatment for more advanced cases of tuberculosis. Accommodation was initially available for only fifteen patients, but open-air sleeping shelters were quickly built, and pavilion wards were added in 1903, when Edward VII consented to be patron of the hospital, and again in 1907, providing more than 100 beds. The therapeutic regime of the hospital was based on the system of fresh-air treatment that had already found favour in German sanatoria, and it was augmented by Philip's own scheme of rest, while the disease was active, and carefully modulated restorative exercise, as the patient began to recover. Work in the hospital grounds and buildings also assisted both in the recovery and the rehabilitation of patients. This occupational side of Philip's scheme was further developed in 1910 when a farm colony was opened at Springfield near Lasswade, for training men in suitable open-air occupations.<br>
<br>In 1898 an agreement was made with the Edinburgh corporation under which the Victoria dispensary and hospital undertook to care for all patients with tuberculosis within the municipal boundaries, while the corporation provided beds for incurable cases. Then in 1906 the Local Government Board for Scotland declared pulmonary tuberculosis a notifiable disease under the <span class="roman">Public Health (Scotland) Act</span> of 1897&#151;an arrangement that Philip had advocated since 1890. In view of the increase in patients that came with this statutory responsibility, the corporation agreed to provide &pound;1000 per annum towards the costs of the hospital and dispensary, and to segregate all advanced and incurable cases in the local hospital for infectious diseases. In 1912 the dispensary again moved to more extensive accommodation in Edinburgh, this time in Spittal Street, where a new laboratory, library, and lecture room were provided. Meanwhile, funds had been made available under the <span class="roman">National Health Insurance Act</span> of 1911 to provide sanatorium treatment for tuberculosis cases. In the following year a departmental committee was appointed under Lord Astor to make detailed recommendations for such provision. Philip was included among the members of the committee, which adopted the Edinburgh scheme, and especially the diagnostic and co-ordinating role of the dispensary, as the model for its recommendations. The disruption of the First World War, and the economic crises that followed it, prevented this scheme being widely implemented by local authorities. Nevertheless, Philip's ideas of surveillance and hygienic supervision became commonplace in public health thinking between the wars. His work was acknowledged when a knighthood was conferred on him in 1913. He was also appointed in that year to the advisory council of the newly established Medical Research Committee (later Council), which likewise had its origins in the <span class="roman">National Health Insurance Act</span> and the Astor Committee.<br>
<br>With the adoption of the national tuberculosis scheme in Edinburgh, in 1914 the Royal Victoria Hospital, dispensary, and farm colony were gifted to the city corporation; Philip was retained as consultant and expert adviser to the corporation. Two years later a new body&#151;the Royal Victoria Hospital Tuberculosis Trust&#151;was created to take charge of the remaining funds and to continue work in areas not covered by the corporation scheme. One of these was the training of medical students, which had been conducted under Philip's direction at both the dispensary and the hospital. In 1917 the trust endowed a chair of tuberculosis at the University of Edinburgh, and Philip became its first occupant; his course of lecture demonstrations was compulsory for candidates for the university's medical degree. In 1920 his consultant post with the corporation was terminated, and he lost access to the facilities of the Royal Victoria Hospital. Consequently in 1922 the trust opened the new Sanatorium Colony at Liberton on the outskirts of Edinburgh for the treatment and employment of tuberculosis patients and the continuation of clinical research. Attached to the sanatorium was a farm where a herd of tuberculin-tested dairy cattle was established as an object lesson in the provision of tuberculosis-free milk.<br>
<br>As well as his specialist activity in the field of tuberculosis, Philip also practised as a general consulting physician; his success in this regard was ensured when, following his knighthood, he was made one of the honorary physicians in Scotland to George V. In 1890 he was appointed assistant physician to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In the same year he became lecturer in chest diseases at the extramural school of medicine; he subsequently also taught courses in general medicine, and was highly regarded as a teacher. He was made a full physician to the infirmary in 1906 and retired in 1921, though he remained on the staff as physician consultant in tuberculosis. In 1887 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He served as secretary to the college in 1894 and president from 1918 to 1923. After retiring from the presidency he became curator of the college's research laboratory, where he had conducted research since its inception in 1887; he held the curatorship until 1937. In 1933 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in recognition of his special services to medicine. He was the local general secretary of the British Medical Association when it met in Edinburgh in 1898, and president of the association when it returned to Edinburgh in 1927. He was also president of the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland in 1937&#150;8. In 1889 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; he was its vice-president from 1927 to 1930. He also served for a while as vice-president of the Queen's Institute of District Nursing (Scottish branch). When the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis was set up in 1898 by the prince of Wales, Philip was appointed a member of the council; he became vice-chairman in 1912 and chairman in 1932. He also became consulting physician to the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association, which co-ordinated sanatorium provision in the principality. He sat on the council of the International Union Against Tuberculosis, and was president of its conference in London in 1921. He was author of <span class="italic">Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Etiological and Therapeutic; Based on an Experimental Investigation</span> (1891), and in 1911 <span class="italic">A Selection of Writings</span> appeared; he wrote <span class="italic">The Actual Position of Tuberculosis To-Day</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Collected Papers on Tuberculosis</span> (1937). Twelve of his former pupils, and many specialists in other countries, prepared a festschrift entitled <span class="italic">The Control and Eradication of Tuberculosis; a Series of International Studies</span> (1911).<br>
<br>In public life Philip cut a forbidding figure. His precise, measured speech and sonorous voice could hold a class or an after-dinner audience, but his students and junior colleagues dreaded the stinging rebukes he was capable of delivering. At home, however, he was a gracious and entertaining host, who took a rather fastidious delight in his choice of dinner menus. His main relaxation was travel, and he was a good linguist, proficient in German, French, and Italian, as well as Latin and Greek. He attended church regularly but did not make any great show of his religion. His work for the anti-tuberculosis movement continued until the very end of his life. His first wife predeceased him in 1937. A year later he married Edith Josephine (<i>d</i>. 1939), eldest daughter of Joseph McGaw, of Kooba, New South Wales, and herself a campaigner against tuberculosis; she had opened the first tuberculosis dispensary in England at Paddington in 1909. Their life together was not destined to last long, however. Philip died at his home, 9 Palmerston Road, Edinburgh, on 25 January 1939, and was cremated three days later at Edinburgh crematorium; the funeral was preceded by a memorial service at St Giles's Cathedral. He left no children, and his second wife survived him by less than a month.<br>
