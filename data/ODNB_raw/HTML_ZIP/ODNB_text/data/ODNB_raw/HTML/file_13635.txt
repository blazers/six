<span class="headword">Hume <span class="st"> [Home]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1424&#150;1516), <span class="occ">Scottish nobility</span>, achieved their domination of the south-east of Scotland before the end of the fifteenth century as the result of a determined pursuit of power, at both local and national levels, over three generations.<h2>
<a name="Risetoprominence14241461"></a>Rise to prominence, 1424&#150;1461</h2>The architect of the Humes' rise was undoubtedly <a name="cosubject_13632"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Hume of that ilk</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1461)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father in 1424 and began a policy of steady expansion in the south-east, starting from a base in the territory of the Merse, north of Berwick. By his marriage to Marion Lauder, granddaughter of Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass, some time before 11 April 1426, Hume eventually acquired lands in Berwickshire and Linlithgowshire. He stepped into the gap created by the forfeiture of Patrick Dunbar, earl of March, in 1435, to support the crown's power-broker in the area, William Douglas, earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1437), and acquire thereby the lands of Lintlaws, Cruiksfield, and Preston for life; and his piety found expression locally in his transformation of the chapel of St Mary of Dunglass into a collegiate church, a process completed by 1450.<br>
<br>In the major struggle between James II and the Black Douglases (1451&#150;5), Sir Alexander Hume was in a difficult position, for though he had received grants from William, eighth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1452)&#151;parts of the lordship of Stewarton in Ayrshire&#151;he had also enjoyed continuing patronage from the king. Initially Hume hedged his bets, being named on the safe-conduct to go to Rome with the earl of Douglas for the papal jubilee in 1450; and he may have collected his bull of foundation for Dunglass collegiate church in person from Pope Nicholas V (<i>r</i>. 1447&#150;55). However, 1451 found both Douglas and James II bidding for Hume support; wisely Sir Alexander opted for the royal side, and by 1453 he was in receipt of royal funds for the defence of Hume Castle. No king's friend&#151;he is never to be found as a royal charter witness&#151;Hume was nevertheless a loyal border magnate, and a natural choice to be a Scottish commissioner at the 1458 border talks at Reddenburn, which produced a truce with England and sought to close the door firmly on the forfeited Douglases. When Sir Alexander died, shortly after 3 February 1461, he left a sizeable family (five sons and two daughters) and a secure inheritance.<h2>
<a name="ConsolidationtheColdinghamdispute"></a>Consolidation: the Coldingham dispute</h2>Sir Alexander was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_13633"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Hume</span>, first Lord Hume  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1491)<span class="occ"></span>, who consolidated the family gains made by his father. Loyalty to James II during the Douglas crisis of the 1450s brought extensive rewards&#151;royal charters of the lands of Dunglass, Hume, Sisterpath, and Kello in 1450, all united into the free barony of Hume at the end of 1451. To these lands were added Chirnside&#151;granted on 4 February 1452, less than three weeks before James II killed the eighth earl of Douglas at Stirling&#151;and Birgham, with a confirmation of the Hume barony in February 1453. In the next reign, Sir Alexander was confirmed in the bailiary of Coldingham, which was made a hereditary office, by the adult James III in November 1472; and Hume's second son, John, was assiduously seeking royal recognition as prior of Coldingham with his father's strong support. A regular attender at parliament since James III's assumption of personal power in 1469, Sir Alexander was created a lord of parliament, as Lord Hume, on 2 August 1473.<br>
<br>However, this elevation may have been little more than an attempt by the king to avoid antagonizing the Humes over a royal plan, first evolved in April 1472, to suppress the priory of Coldingham, a daughter house of Durham (in Berwickshire, where its position had become increasingly uncertain since the beginning of the Anglo-Scottish wars), and reallocate its revenues to the Chapel Royal of St Mary of the Rock, St Andrews. A revised version of this plan in 1473, envisaging a collegiate church&#151;but <i>not</i> retaining the priory&#151;at Coldingham, may have been intended as a further royal olive branch. However, any scheme which rejected John Hume's claim to be prior of Coldingham was doomed from the start, for the first lord, bailie of Coldingham for more than a generation, lord of parliament, and (from 1476) a march warden, found royal interference in the growing Hume empire in the south-east unwelcome, and resisted it strenuously with the committed support of his sons. The political struggle over the future of Coldingham was conducted by these younger men. Alexander Hume, the first lord, cannot be shown to have taken an active part in politics after 1479, though he lived long enough to see Dunglass erected into a burgh of barony in June 1489, a year after James IV's accession.<br>
<br>Hume was the father of seven sons from two marriages. With his first wife, Mariota, heir of Landells in Berwickshire, he had four sons: Alexander, who died before his father, but already married and with two sons, Alexander (second Lord Hume) and John; John, prior of Coldingham; George of Aytoun; and Patrick of Fastcastle. The second marriage, to Margaret, daughter of Alexander, master of Montgomery in Ayrshire, produced three sons, Thomas of Langshaw, Nicholas, and David.<h2>
<a name="ConflictwithJamesIII14801488"></a>Conflict with James III, 1480&#150;1488</h2>It fell to <a name="cosubject_13634"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Hume</span>, second Lord Hume  (<em>d.</em> 1506)<span class="occ"></span>, grandson of the first lord, to steer the family safely through the turbulent 1480s to the calmer political waters of the reign of James IV. Before he succeeded to the lordship in 1492, Alexander and his kin had successfully resisted and seen off one Stewart king and received extensive rewards from his successor.<br>
<br>In the early 1480s the Humes were faced with a stark choice of loyalties: on the one hand James III, who had not abandoned his Coldingham plans, on the other the king's brother Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany (<i>d</i>. 1485), in 1482 claiming King James's throne or, at the least, control of royal government. Albany's initial successes in the 1482 crisis&#151;entering Scotland accompanied by a huge English army&#151;meant that he was a man who could not be ignored by border magnates such as the Humes. However, Albany was also earl of March, and as such his success would represent a threat to the Humes, who had initially come to prominence following the forfeiture of March in 1435. In the event, Alexander Hume performed a dramatic political volte-face at the end of January 1483, first joining Albany and his supporters at Dunbar Castle to plot the seizure or overthrow of James III, then moving swiftly to Edinburgh to reveal the conspiracy to the king. Hume had chosen the right side; by April 1483 Albany was a fugitive, by July he was a forfeited exile, and in a series of grants of territory within the earldom of March to Alexander and his Hume kinsmen, King James expressed his gratitude for recent Hume support. By January 1484, indeed, Alexander Hume was being described as a royal familiar.<br>
<br>However, the Coldingham dispute had not been resolved. It acquired a new and dangerous lease of life in 1484&#150;5, when Alexander's uncle John Hume misused royal letters to obtain a new set of bulls from the pope, confirming his status as prior of Coldingham. In October 1487 James III effectively declared war, not only on the Humes, but on any magnates who were prepared to join them in resisting royal plans for Coldingham. Thus the king himself precipitated the revolt of 1488 which cost him his life at Sauchieburn (11 June). Throughout this crisis the Humes remained rebel hard-liners&#151;given James III's attitude, they had no other choice&#151;and, together with their allies and kinsmen, the Hepburns, they were the major beneficiaries of the uprising and the advent of a new king, the fifteen-year-old James IV. Thus in the parliament of October 1488 Alexander Hume was confirmed as chamberlain for life; over the next two years, he acquired the wardenship of the east march and the custody of Stirling Castle and of James IV's brother, John, earl of Mar; and the Coldingham dispute was at last resolved in favour of John Hume as prior.<h2>
<a name="Gainsandlosses14881516"></a>Gains and losses, 1488&#150;1516</h2>A spate of royal grants and confirmations to Alexander Hume between 1488 and 1491&#151;the bailiary of Ettrick Forest, the keepership of Newark, the stewardship of Dunbar, an Edinburgh town house, lands in Ayrshire, Stirlingshire, Fife, and the Merse&#151;further increased Hume strength. When Alexander was finally served heir to his grandfather, as second Lord Hume, in 1492, he responded to royal rewards with a career of unswerving loyalty to James IV&#151;in the front line during the Anglo-Scottish wars of 1496&#150;7, taking a leading part in the Scottish naval expedition to Denmark in the summer of 1502, and serving as a commissioner to exchange the ratifications of the &#145;treaty of perpetual peace&#146;, in December of the same year. Alexander, second Lord Hume, died on 9 September 1506. He was twice married: first to Isobel Douglas, a marriage soon dissolved (May 1476) owing to its illegality in canon law; and second to Nichola Ker, daughter and heir of George Ker of Samuelston, with whom the second lord had seven sons&#151;Alexander, who succeeded him as third Lord Hume, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13641/', "George Hume")</script> (the future fourth lord), John, Patrick, William, Andrew, and David&#151;and three daughters, Elizabeth, Mariota, and Nichola.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13635"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Hume</span>, third Lord Hume  (<em>d.</em> 1516)<span class="occ"></span>, rapidly succeeded to his father's extensive lands and to the office of chamberlain. The third lord anticipated James IV's invasion of Northumberland in August&#150;September 1513 by taking a large force of borderers into England on a plunder raid early in August; but while withdrawing on 13 August, he was ambushed at Milfield near Wooler by Sir Henry Bulmer, and suffered heavy losses in what came to be known as the &#145;ill raid&#146;. A month later Hume fought alongside James IV at Flodden, and together with his ally Alexander Gordon, earl of Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1524), was one of the few Scottish magnates of note to survive the battle. Later&#151;and extremely dubious&#151;tales suggested that James IV had also survived, and that he had been murdered by the Humes. More believable is Pitscottie's story that Huntly and Hume, having fought and won in their own sector of the battlefield, refused to lend any further assistance to the Scottish army and withdrew from the field. The third lord had, after all, been in the field for a month longer than anyone else, and suffered heavily on the &#145;ill raid&#146;.<br>
<br>In the tortuous political power struggle which followed Flodden, with the queen mother and her new husband, Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1557), opposing the return from France of John Stewart, duke of Albany (<i>d</i>. 1536), as governor for the infant James V, Alexander, third Lord Hume, at first sided with Albany, but then (possibly because Albany was restored to his father's earldom of March and thereby became a potential local menace to Hume dominance) changed sides, and plotted with others to obtain possession of the king. Failing in this, and once pardoned, he again took to arms, but, along with his brother William, was tried and convicted for treason, forfeited, and beheaded in Edinburgh on 8 October 1516. He was married, between September 1513 and February 1514, to Agnes Stewart, widow of Adam Hepburn, second earl of Bothwell; they had one daughter, Janet.<br>
<br>Overall, Hume dominance in the south-east of Scotland, and influence in royal politics in general, had been gained&#151;with the notable exception of the Coldingham episode&#151;through service to the crown. Two successive dukes of Albany, acting as earls of March, presented a local threat and proved fatal to one Hume lord in 1516; but the title and many of the estates were restored to Alexander's brother George, who succeeded as fourth Lord Hume in August 1522.<br>
