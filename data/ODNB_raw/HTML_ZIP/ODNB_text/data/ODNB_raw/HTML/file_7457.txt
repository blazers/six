<span class="headword">Lisle,  Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps  de</span>  (1809&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic layman and ecumenist</span>, eldest son of Charles March Phillipps (1779&#150;1862), of Garendon Park, Leicestershire, was born at Garendon, the home of his grandparents, on 17 March 1809. His mother, Harriet (1790&#150;1813), youngest daughter of Gerald Gustavus Ducarel of Walford, Somerset, died when her son was five years old. In youth he was delicate and solitary. The choice of Maisemore Court School, near Gloucester (it was later moved to Edgbaston), was not a happy one, but was crucial to the rest of his life. Phillipps's unhappiness there was aggravated by religious questions to which the answers he was given seemed contradictory. The French master, Abb&eacute; Giraud, an emigr&eacute; priest exiled by the revolution in France, treated him kindly and lent him books. Without the knowledge of his family, Phillipps at the age of sixteen was received as a Roman Catholic at the church of St Peter, Birmingham.<br>
<br>After tuition at home, Phillipps matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1826. His religious affiliation was reinforced by his friendship with Kenelm Digby, a recent convert and the author of books which extolled the holiness of the medieval period and the principles of chivalry. Phillipps began to emphasize his descent from a knight who had accompanied Duke William to England and was rewarded by land on the Isle of Wight, from which the family name Lisle derived. He changed his name to de Lisle in 1862, on the death of his father and his inheritance of the Garendon estates.<br>
<br>Each Sunday, Phillipps, with Digby, rode to St Edmund's, Ware, 25 miles from Cambridge to attend mass. In the spring of 1828 the exertion overpowered him and his lungs were affected. He left Cambridge and was taken by his father to winter in Rome. Here he met John, sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury, a Roman Catholic peer, who was later to provide substantial sums for church building in England, often at Phillipps's prompting. He also met Hugh Clifford, later seventh baron, whose ward Laura was to become Phillipps's wife. During this and a subsequent visit to Rome a year later, he was received by two popes, Leo XII and Pius VIII, and made the acquaintance of Luigi Gentili and his superior, Antonio Rosmini, and Dominic Barberi.<br>
<br>Phillipps visited a hermit who predicted that he would father a large family, and that he would not die until he had seen the reunion of the churches, in which process he would play a part. This incident became the justification for many later initiatives. Phillipps married Laura Mary Clifford on 25 July 1833; she bore sixteen children, to whom he was devoted. They set up house in 1835 at Grace Dieu Manor, Whitwick, with adjoining acres and tenants provided from his father's estates nearby. This became the focus of his social and religious programme. A. W. N. Pugin, architect and a friend of Phillipps's, designed extensions to the house several times, and also to the Gothic chapel where an elaborate liturgy, with plainchant sung by a choir, was provided on feast days. Phillipps refused to accept nomination to parliament, but took on local appointments as magistrate, deputy lieutenant, and, in 1868, high sheriff, of Leicestershire.<br>
<br>The conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1830 of George Spencer, son of the second Earl Spencer, was at least partly owing to Phillipps's influence; it was the catalyst that encouraged him to act to bring about what he called &#145;the return of England to Catholic unity&#146;. This was to be achieved in two ways: by the conversion of individuals and, more importantly, by the corporate absorption of whole groups into the Roman Catholic communion. He built chapels in the Gothic style in his neighbourhood and brought priests to minister in them. The proportion of Roman Catholics increased substantially. In 1835 he bought 230 acres of land to found a Cistercian monastery, with buildings designed by Pugin and largely paid for by Lord Shrewsbury. Two major attempts were made by him to secure corporate reunion. The first, in 1841, was the subject of a lengthy correspondence with J. R. Bloxam of Magdalen College, Oxford, and other Tractarians, but was short-lived. The second, in 1856, in collaboration with F. G. Lee, led to the founding of the Association for the Promotion of Christian Unity. At its peak in 1862 there were 8000 members, of whom 1000 were Roman Catholics. A ban from the Holy Office required them to withdraw in 1864, which they did. But de Lisle continued his ecumenical efforts with greater discretion, by correspondence and exchanges of hospitality with friends and acquaintances in England and abroad. Grace Dieu became a meeting place across denominational boundaries. Portrayal of de Lisle, faintly disguised as Eustace Lyle, a Roman Catholic philanthropist, in the novel <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> by Benjamin Disraeli was the result of meeting members of the Young England movement.<br>
<br>Although a life-long Conservative, in 1868 de Lisle established a friendship with William Gladstone, who made a visit to Garendon in 1873 while prime minister. When Gladstone asked de Lisle, an &#145;opportunist&#146; over the impending definition of papal infallibility in 1870, for help in drafting pamphlets in reaction to the Vatican decrees, de Lisle was able to see that J. H. Newman, whom he had known since 1841, received a proof copy. It owed much to his insistence that Newman was persuaded to write his <span class="italic">Letter to the Duke of Norfolk</span>. It was a type of covert activity typical of de Lisle, who incurred accusations of meddling in the church's business. But from the perspective of the late twentieth century, with its emphasis on the participation of lay people, he can be seen as something of a prophet. He was also unusual for a Roman Catholic in taking an important part with Gladstone in the campaign against the Bulgarian atrocities in 1876. De Lisle was small and slight in appearance; he weighed 9 stone in 1844, and was described, in 1856, as delicate with a &#145;trifle melancholy look&#146;. His writings were not well received in his lifetime, due partly to their verbosity. He died on 5 March 1878 and was buried in the abbey church of Mount St Bernard, which he had founded.<br>
<br>His eighth son, <a name="cosubject_7458"></a><span class="headword">Rudolph Edward March Phillipps  de Lisle</span>  (1853&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Grace Dieu on 23 November 1853 and entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> on 2 May 1867. In August 1884 he was appointed to the naval brigade attached to the upper Nile expedition sent to relieve Gordon at Khartoum. He was killed at the battle of Abu Klea on 17 January 1885 and buried on the battlefield. His letters to his family, which survive in the de Lisle archives, contain descriptions of scenes he witnessed during his naval career, particularly in South America.<br>
