<span class="headword">Stewart,  Patrick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Black Patie]</span>, second earl of Orkney  (<em>c.</em>1566/7&#150;1615), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was the second son and fourth of the eight legitimate children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26504/', "Robert Stewart, first earl of Orkney (1533&#150;1593)")</script>, and his wife, Jean Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1598). His birth date can be arrived at only by conjecture. He was placed for a time under the tutelage of Sir Patrick Waus of Barnbarroch, his godfather, and in 1582 received the <i>commenda</i> of the priory of Whithorn, previously held by his uncle, James V's illegitimate son Robert Stewart <i>secundus</i>. Neither Patrick nor his elder brother, Henry Stewart, master of Orkney, enjoyed good relations with their father. Henry, who died in 1585, had been suspected of dealings with Robert's enemy the earl of Caithness, and Robert was not anxious that Patrick should cut any sort of figure at court, as he might &#145;rather do evill thair nor guid&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Black Patie</span>, 17).<br>
<br>The troubles which Robert Stewart experienced at the hands of Sir Lewis Bellenden and Sir John Maitland of Thirlestane in the late 1580s created difficulties for Patrick himself for a time, but James VI took an interest in him, created him lord of Shetland (<i>c</i>.1590), and granted him a tack (lease) of the revenues of those islands to sustain him at court. By the time of his father's death in 1593 he had effectively been advanced to the dignity of earl, though he was not to receive charters of the earldom and bishopric lands for some years. He aimed high in matrimony, sending an envoy to plead his suit with the sister of Maurice of Nassau, the stadholder of the Netherlands, but had to settle for a dispute-resolving match with Margaret Livingston (<i>d</i>. in or after 1619), the widow of his father's old adversary Sir Lewis Bellenden of Auchnoull. They were married on 17 August 1596; the king was present at the festivities, though Stewart had already begun to antagonize him by supporting the queen in quarrels over the upbringing of Prince Henry.<br>
<br>During the 1590s opposition to Stewart built up in Orkney and Shetland as he sought to reappropriate land previously alienated by his father. His adversaries included his own brothers John Stewart, master of Orkney (who was alleged to have employed witchcraft against him), and the illegitimate James Stewart of Graemsay. Also involved were members of the class of Scottish lairds who had grown up since the feuing-off of the bishopric lands under Bishop Adam Bothwell in the early 1560s and Patrick's father in the 1580s. Prominent among the Orcadians were Robert Monteith of Egilsay, as well as members of the Balfour family and the Sinclairs of Eday, who had financial backing from the earl of Caithness. In Shetland, Patrick's uncle Laurence Bruce of Cultmalindie was the most determined of his opponents. These disputes between the earl and his clients were ostensibly resolved in 1597 by arbitration and a general finding of sureties by all concerned. In 1600 he was granted charters of the earldom and bishopric.<br>
<br>This was simply a signal for Stewart to pursue with even more vigour a fatally extravagant way of life, surrounding himself with a pretentious retinue and embarking on a magnificent building programme, at the expense of the island lairds and also his own purse. Monteith of Egilsay, Bruce of Cultmalindie, and the rest appealed against his activities and finally reached the ear of the king, who became more and more angered by Stewart's continued refusal to pay heed to his critics. Attempts to curb his excesses through the advice of Sir John Arnot of Barswick and the appointment of a strong bishop of Orkney in James Law came to nothing, and he was eventually warded in Edinburgh Castle. He spent the last seven years of his life in increasing degrees of restriction and humiliation as, &#145;drownit in debt&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Black Patie</span>, 80), his supplies of cash petered out to nothing.<br>
<br>Stewart's final downfall came slowly, however, since all, from the king downwards, were extremely reluctant to humiliate him totally. He was invited to surrender the earldom in exchange for the keepership of one of the royal palaces, but refused. The end came with his execution, an event which was made possible only because of his curious refusal at the last to distance himself from the rebellion of Robert Stewart, the illegitimate son of his liaison with Marjorie Sinclair. Robert had made two attempts to take over the strongholds of Orkney&#151;the earl's palaces in Birsay and Kirkwall and the cathedral and castle in Kirkwall&#151;in 1612 and again in 1614. On the second occasion he was for a time successful, and the earl of Caithness led an expedition to put down the rebellion. Caithness found Kirkwall Castle a difficult house to attack, but Robert was a weak and indecisive leader and in the end the rebels surrendered their strongholds one by one, the castle being last.<br>
<br>Robert Stewart and several of his followers were executed. While the earl had up to this point been extremely adept at covering up his complicity in Robert's actions, the execution of his son seems to have broken his nerve. He confessed that he had ordered Robert to rise in rebellion and threw himself on the mercy of the king. He was sentenced to death and executed by the maiden, an early form of guillotine, on 6 February 1615 at the Mercat Cross, Edinburgh. Stories of his being too ignorant to repeat the Lord's prayer appear fanciful, and it is more likely that he required comfort and counsel before he could face execution, which was postponed by a couple of days.<br>
<br>Stewart's fall brought indigence to many, including his wife, and an end to the Stewart earldom. His brother John Stewart was created earl of Carrick, the name apparently deriving from the place of that name in Eday, but he failed in his attempts to gain possession of his brother's former lands.<br>
<br>Although Patrick Stewart had no legitimate children, he has cast a long shadow over the northern isles. On the one hand there are the visible traces of his rule, his buildings. These, the castle of Scalloway and the earl's palace in Kirkwall, are thought to have been the work of Andrew Crawford, his master of works. The palace is a triumph, described as &#145;possibly the most mature and accomplished piece of Renaissance architecture left in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inventory of &hellip; Orkney</span>, 142). On the other there has been a long tradition of his reputation as Black Patie, a symbol of evil and misrule. Much of the detail of the Black Patie legend is fanciful, but it is strong enough for Stewart's name to reappear from time to time, in uncomplimentary terms, in modern political discourse within the islands.<br>
