<span class="headword">Lindsay,  David</span>, Lord Edzell  (1551?&#150;1610), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of David Lindsay, ninth earl of Crawford, and his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1578), daughter of Sir John Campbell of Calder. His father had become ninth earl of Crawford in 1542 as a result of the disinheritance five years earlier of the eighth earl's only son. But when the ninth earl died on 20 September 1558 the earldom passed to the grandson of the eighth earl, another David Lindsay, while the latter's cousin and namesake inherited the Edzell estates. His mother was responsible for bringing up and educating her children and for managing the family estates. Together with his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16705/', "John Lindsay, later Lord Menmuir")</script>, David Lindsay of Edzell was educated on the continent and at Cambridge by James Lawson, a future colleague at St Giles, Edinburgh, of John Knox. On a contract dated 1 and 2 March 1570 Edzell married Lady Helen Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1579), daughter of David Lindsay, tenth earl of Crawford. They had four children, David, who succeeded to Edzell, John, Alexander of Canterland, and Margaret, who married David Carnegie, first earl of Southesk. Edzell was among those who, on 3 May 1578, signed a band in favour of the earl of Mar as guardian of James VI, and he was knighted when Esm&eacute; Stewart was created duke of Lennox on 5 August 1581. In 1586 Edzell was appointed an extraordinary lord of session. His participation in national affairs increased considerably after his brother, Lord Menmuir, became incapacitated and then died. Shortly before his death Menmuir had resigned his position as an ordinary lord of session to Edzell, who successfully passed the trial of his abilities and was admitted a judge on 2 March 1598 under the title of Lord Edzell. He also stepped into two other of his brother's offices, that of privy councillor (his first appearance was on 16 November 1598), and master of the metals. Between 13 May 1597 and 7 June 1605 Lord Edzell attended six conventions of the estates, a more informal, less authoritative alternative to a parliament. He was also a commissioner for the summoning of parliament.<br>
<br>Edzell combined a wide variety of talents and interests. &#145;[H]e was learned and accomplished&#151;the sword, the pen, and pruninghook were equally familiar to him; he even anticipated the geologist's hammer, and had at least a taste for architecture and design&#146;  (Crawford, 1.339). He devoted much attention to the utilization of the minerals on his estate, agricultural improvements, building, and planting trees. The walled garden which he built at Edzell is the finest surviving example of its kind produced by the Scottish Renaissance. It is decorated on three sides with relief panels on which are carved the liberal arts, the planetary gods, and the cardinal virtues, and its walls are also pierced with small rectangular holes arranged to represent the fess chequy of his family's arms. At his death he had a library of 144 books. Edzell and his family were, however, both victims of, and participants in, the endemic violence that plagued Scottish society at this time. Two of his brothers, Robert Lindsay of Balhall and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16716/', "Sir Walter Lindsay of Balgavie")</script>, were murdered. On 27 October 1583 Edzell and twenty-one others were granted a remission for the murder of John Campbell of Lundie. For his negligence in failing to prevent a fray between his son Alexander and the young laird of Pitarrow in the high street of Edinburgh on 17 June 1605 he was briefly warded first in Dumbarton, then in Stirling Castle. On 5 June 1607 his eldest son and heir, David, mortally wounded Alexander Lindsay, Lord Spynie, in Edinburgh in a quarrel arising from the murder of his uncle, Sir Walter. The earl of Crawford blamed Lord Edzell himself for this act, but did not appear to prosecute on 19 September 1609, the date set for his trial. Edzell's second marriage, to Isobel Forbes, on a contract dated 1 December 1585, was childless, and she survived him. He had an illegitimate son, Thomas Lindsay, who was also implicated in Lord Spynie's death. Lord Edzell died on 15 December 1610 at Edzell Castle.<br>
