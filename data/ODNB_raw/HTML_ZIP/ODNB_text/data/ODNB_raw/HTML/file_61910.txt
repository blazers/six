<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Massey,  Raymond</span>  (1896&#150;1983), <span class="occ">actor and director</span>, was born on 30 August 1896 in Toronto, Canada, the son of Chester Massey (<i>d</i>. 1926) and his wife, Anna Vincent Dobbins (1859&#150;1903). His paternal ancestors had emigrated to America in 1630 and had become one of the most prominent families in Canada: for three years his father was president of Massey-Ferguson, the manufacturers of agricultural implements. His mother, who died during a family visit to Europe in 1903, was American and a graduate of Smith College, and in 1952 his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34919/', "(Charles) Vincent Massey")</script> became the first governor-general of Canada to have been born in that country. The family had been deeply religious and suspicious of, if not actively hostile to, the theatre, but Massey began to develop an interest in theatre-going while still at school in Ontario.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War found Massey touring France with his brother Vincent. He returned to Canada, enrolled at the University of Toronto, and worked briefly in the family firm before enlisting for military service. Wounded in France, he eventually joined a Canadian expeditionary force to Siberia, where the intention was to support the White Russians against the Bolsheviks. During a period of enforced idleness in Vladivostok he helped to organize a &#145;minstrel show&#146;, which stimulated his interest in stage performance.<br>
<br>In 1919 Massey was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, where he was distinguished more for his rowing than for his academic prowess. He belonged to a play-reading circle rather than the University Dramatic Society, but after two years he left Oxford without a degree, subsequently admitting that he had frittered away his time. During a holiday in Cornwall he met Margery Fremantle, an art student who in 1920 became his first wife. They were divorced in 1929: he later wrote that &#145;we both displayed an astonishing lack of judgement, and we were soon aware of it&#146;  (Massey, <span class="italic">A Hundred Different Lives</span>, 14).<br>
<br>By now convinced that his future career lay in the theatre, Massey found employment at the newly established Everyman Theatre in Hampstead where he remained for several productions before experiencing his first West End success with a small part in the comedy <span class="italic">At Mrs Beam's</span> (1923) by C. K. Munro. He was cast in two small roles in George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> in 1925, and began to appear in, stage manage, and, eventually, direct numerous Sunday night performances, at that time the principal means of trying out new plays.<br>
<br>In collaboration with Allen Wade and George Carr, Massey entered into the management of the Everyman, directing and appearing in new plays and classic revivals, until financial difficulties following the general strike in 1926 put a stop to the enterprise. By 1926 his position as an actor in the West End was well established, and he used his wider managerial experience in helping to organize the actors' union Equity. He was equally at home playing English and American parts, and scored a success playing the Khan Aghaba in <span class="italic">The Transit of Venus</span> (1927). 1929, the year of his divorce, saw his second marriage, to the actress Gladys Allen (1907&#150;1993), whose stage name was Adrianne Allen. His first appearance in New York followed in 1931, as Hamlet, in a spectacular production by Norman Bel Geddes: from then onwards he was to appear regularly in the United States and Canada.<br>
<br>In 1930 Raymond Massey began his film career, with a brief stint in Hollywood: during his lifetime he appeared in more than seventy films, under directors including James Whale and Alexander Korda, and with actors including John Wayne and William Powell, with whom he formed a close friendship. His career in the theatre continued with the title role in the stage adaptation of Edith Wharton's <span class="italic">Ethan Frome</span> at the National Theatre, New York, which he regarded as &#145;just about the best dramatization of a novel ever to be seen in the theatre&#146;  (Massey, <span class="italic">A Hundred Different Lives</span>, 197). He was best remembered by the American public, however, for his performance as Lincoln in Robert Sherwood's <span class="italic">Abe Lincoln in Illinois</span>, which began its lengthy run in October 1938 and was subsequently made into a film; the author had asked him to play Lincoln after seeing his performance as Hamlet, impressed both by his abilities as an actor and by the tall, gaunt appearance which fitted him physically for the role.<br>
<br>Massey was divorced (amicably) from his second wife in 1939, and in that year married Dorothy Ludington Whitney, a lawyer whom he described as &#145;a Connecticut woman of the same Puritan ancestry as myself&#146;  (Massey, <span class="italic">A Hundred Different Lives</span>, 248). His career was now based in the United States, where his appearances ranged from &#145;acting one heavy after another&#146;  (ibid., 272) in films under contract to the Warner brothers to playing Sir Colenso Ridgeon in the New York production in 1942 of <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> by George Bernard Shaw. In the same year he enlisted in the Canadian army, but, finding himself unable to do anything worthwhile as a &#145;desk warrior&#146;  (ibid., 290), he soon returned to the stage. In 1944 he played the stage manager in Thornton Wilder's <span class="italic">Our Town</span> to United States troops on service in Europe, and in the same year he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.<br>
<br>In the post-war theatre, Massey's reputation as a serious and intelligent actor ensured that he was rarely out of work. Although Conservative politically and traditional in his approach to the craft of acting (he distrusted the Stanislavsky-based &#145;method&#146;) he was associated with many of the attempts to enlarge the horizons of the American stage. In 1952 the only play of which he was the author, <span class="italic">The Hanging Judge</span>, based on a novel by Bruce Hamilton, had a successful run at the New Theatre, London; in America in the same year, Charles Laughton directed him in a dramatized reading of Stephen Ben&eacute;t's poem <span class="italic">John Brown's Body</span>, whose simple but powerful format proved highly popular. Massey's last Broadway appearance took place in 1958, when he played Mr Zuss in Archibald McLeish's poetic drama <span class="italic">JB</span>.<br>
<br>In 1959 Massey moved from his Connecticut home to Beverly Hills in Los Angeles in order to be closer to the opportunities offered by the expanding television industry, and in 1960 he was invited to play Dr Gillespie in <span class="italic">Dr Kildare</span>. Over the next five years he was to become familiar to a vast public in this popular series. Although arthritis was now making it more difficult for him to appear on the stage, in 1970, at the age of seventy-five, he returned to London's West End in Robert Anderson's <span class="italic">I Never Sang for my Father</span>. In his final stage appearance, in 1975, he played the 93-year-old Jonathan Coffin in Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">The Night of the Iguana</span>.<br>
<br>Massey wrote two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">When I was Young</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">A Hundred Different Lives</span> (1979), and was awarded seven honorary degrees from universities in Canada and the United States. Two of his children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103953/', "Anna Massey")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69552/', "Daniel Massey")</script>, followed him into the theatre. Raymond Massey died in Los Angeles in July 1983.<br>
