<span class="headword">Bonarjee, Stephen Wilson</span>  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">radio editor</span>, was born on 15 May 1912 at Pitcarmick, West Heath Road, Abbeywood, Erith, Kent, the son of Pitt Bonarjee, a minister in the Congregational church, and his wife, Florence Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. His father, who had been a civil servant in Simla before turning to the ministry, was Indian, and his mother a Scot. An uncle had helped found the Indian National Congress. Sent to Caterham School, he stood as a Liberal in its mock election in 1929 (and won), an early sign of the political commitment that for most of his life&#151;working in the BBC where impartiality was expected&#151;he had to suppress. He went on to St Andrews University to read English before entering journalism on local papers in Leeds and Huddersfield and thence, in 1938, the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. The outbreak of the Second World War saw Bonarjee volunteer: he served with the Royal Sussex regiment and then the Lancashire fusiliers, reaching the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Demobilized, Bonarjee returned to journalism in 1946, but this time in radio, then enjoying its golden age at the core of national life. He began as a talks producer, left briefly for Alexandra Palace and the fledgeling television service, but was soon back at Broadcasting House. Over the next two decades he proved himself both popular and influential, invigorating coverage of current affairs. It was he who hired (in 1954) a young and assertive Robin Day, first as a speaker on a current affairs programme called <span class="italic">Topic for Tonight</span> and then as a producer on another, also on the Home Service, called <span class="italic">At Home and Abroad</span>. This, Day recalled in his memoirs, was his entry into &#145;the priesthood of broadcasting&#146;  (Day, 71). <span class="italic">Topic for Tonight</span> and <span class="italic">At Home and Abroad</span> were only two of the shows Bonarjee launched, produced, or revived as he rose to become head of current affairs in BBC radio. He began <span class="italic">From Our Own Correspondent</span>, still running more than fifty years later, for reporters to convey the flavour of life in distant lands; he made <span class="italic">The Week in Westminster</span> lively and challenging where previously it had been dull and dusty; and he ran <span class="italic">Ten O'Clock</span>, which, when it replaced the 9 p.m. news bulletin on the Home Service in 1960, was radio's first daily offering of news analysis. Two of the arguments for 10 p.m.&#151;that it was better suited for late debates in the Commons and better able to bring news from the USA because of the time difference&#151;also found favour with ITN when seven years later in 1967 it launched <span class="italic">News at Ten</span>. Bonarjee also helped shape general election coverage, by introducing psephologists, dons, and journalists to comment on the results in a way later taken for granted but innovative then.<br>
<br>It was Robin Day who, in a memorandum of 1955, first proposed the programme that became <span class="italic">Today</span>. But Bonarjee made his mark on the programme in a particularly important way. Becoming editor in 1962, when its presenter was still the eccentric Jack de Manio, he was instrumental in transforming it from a frothy cappuccino into the place where decision-makers would queue up to drop a word in the nation's ear. <span class="italic">Today</span> was transferred from talks to current affairs in 1963, gradually changing from morning miscellany to agenda-setting controversy. A four-page document Bonarjee wrote for colleagues was one of the earliest BBC memos to call a programme a &#145;product&#146; and suggest a &#145;sharper&#146; edge&#151;words that also later became commonplace but were quite novel then:<blockquote>in general the programme will need rather more &#145;roughage&#146; in the shape of sharper, harder material &hellip; we would all agree, I know, that it [<span class="italic">Today</span>] should invariably be a lively, polished product. To this I would add that it should have a forward-looking feel about it, should concern itself mainly with broad extrovert human interests and talking points, but should not be afraid to be serious when necessary (although hardly ever solemn). (WAC, R51/1,000/11, 3 Sept 1963)</blockquote>Bonarjee also brought in the popular John Timpson as co-host of <span class="italic">Today</span> in 1970 and was there when de Manio left in 1971.<br>
<br>In 1972, when he attained the BBC's compulsory retirement age of sixty, Bonarjee left the corporation. No longer required to be politically neutral, he became press secretary for the Liberal Party, then led by the scandal-hit Jeremy Thorpe, who was succeeded in 1976 by David Steel. Steel described him as &#145;a most efficient and congenial press spokesman&#146;  (private information). He was later broadcasting adviser to the general synod of the Church of England, in which his father had tried, but failed, to become ordained, and chaired the National Liberal Club from 1994 to 1997. He died of bronchopneumonia on 14 September 2003 at St George's Nursing Home, Westminster.<br>
