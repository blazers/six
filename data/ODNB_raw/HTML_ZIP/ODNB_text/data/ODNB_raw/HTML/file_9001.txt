<span class="headword">Everard,  Thomas</span>  (1560&#150;1633), <span class="occ">Jesuit and translator</span>, was born on 8 February 1560, and baptized on 10 February at Linstead Parva, Suffolk, the son of Henry Everard (<i>d</i>. 1596), of Pond Hall, Linstead Magna, and Catherine Gawdy. His father was imprisoned in 1578&#150;9 in the common gaol at Bury St Edmunds for refusing to conform to the established church. He was repeatedly fined for recusancy from 1581 until his death in 1596, leaving the estate heavily in debt with accumulated unpaid fines. In 1572 Thomas Everard entered Jesus College, Cambridge, where he remained for two years, and then possibly enrolled at one of the inns of court as did his brothers. At the age of thirty, in 1590, he met the Jesuit John Gerard either in London or, more probably, at Lawshall, Suffolk, where Gerard was living with Henry and Elizabeth Drury. A number of Catholics from the eastern counties visited Gerard there for instruction and to make the spiritual exercises under his direction. Among them were Everard and his cousin Anthony Rous of Dennington. As a result of Gerard's influence both men left England in 1591 to enter the English College at Rheims, receiving the diaconate in 1592 and priest's orders later in the same year. In 1593 Everard entered the Society of Jesus at Tournai and followed the course of Jesuit formation at houses in the Spanish Netherlands until his final profession in 1604.<br>
<br>Everard was sent to join John Gerard in London in 1605. Gerard referred to him in his autobiography as Everett, not a pseudonym but a common variant of Everard. In the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot, Robert Cecil had ordered a particular search to be made for Gerard. Everard, who was considered to resemble him, had two narrow escapes from arrest, once when tracked to Gerard's house and the second even more dramatically as he was preparing to say mass on Maundy Thursday. As it was thought to be too risky for him to remain in London he moved to East Anglia, where for five years he tramped the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk saying mass and strengthening the scattered Roman Catholic communities. In Suffolk he met his cousin Anthony Rous who had weakened under the rigours of the missionary life. In 1608 he had betrayed a fellow priest, Thomas Garnet SJ, and abandoning his Roman Catholic priesthood retired to be incumbent of the Church of England parish of Sweeting, Norfolk. Everard appears to have reconciled him to the Roman Catholic church as in 1613 both returned to Flanders, Everard to St Omer and Rous to Louvain.<br>
<br>An able linguist, Everard continued to work on the translations into English of spiritual classics from Latin, Spanish, and Italian originals which he had begun during the final years of his Jesuit training. Those published, mostly in St Omer, include two works of Luca Pinelli, published as <span class="italic">The Mirrour of Religious Perfection</span> (1618) and <span class="italic">Meditations upon the &hellip; Sacrament</span> (1622); <span class="italic">The Paradise of the Soule</span> by Albertus Magnus (1617) and translation of works by Francisco Arias and St Francis Borgia were included in the compilation <span class="italic">A Treatise of Mental Prayer</span> (1617). Less certainly he may have been involved in two translations of the works by Fulvio Androzzi published as <span class="italic">Certaine Devout Considerations of Frequenting the Blessed Sacrament</span> (1606) and <span class="italic">Meditations uppon the Passion</span> (1606). Later works included an adaptation of works by Luis de la Puente, published as <span class="italic">Meditations upon the Mysteries of our Faith</span> (1624), of St Francis Borgia published in <span class="italic">The Practice of Christian Workes</span> (1620), and, perhaps in collaboration with John Heigham, <span class="italic">An Instruction how to Pray and Meditate Well</span> (1618) from the work of Ignacio Balsamo. Finally, he may have been responsible for three posthumous translations from Bellarmine published from 1638 to 1641.<br>
<br>In 1618 Everard was back again in Suffolk where he was arrested and imprisoned, and was finally exiled from England in 1620. In 1623 he attempted to return to England disguised as a soldier and using the pseudonym of Harrison, but was arrested on arrival at Dover and imprisoned in the castle for three months. He was then bound over in the sum of &pound;100 to appear before the magistrates in London. For the last ten years of his life he divided his time between Suffolk and London, continuing with his translations. Contemporary accounts describe his increasing lameness and the loss of power in his arms and finally his blindness, so that in London he could not go about nor read. When he could no longer work he filled his time with vocal and mental prayer. It was remarked that he returned to the familiar patterns of prayer taught him as a child, the rosary and in particular, the much loved Jesus psalter of pre-Reformation English Catholic piety. He died in London on 16 May 1633.<br>
