<span class="headword">Baynes,  Alfred Henry</span>  (1838&#150;1914), <span class="occ">missionary society administrator</span>, was born on 11 April 1838 at Wellington, Somerset, ninth son of Joseph Baynes, Baptist minister at Wellington, and Anna Day Ash, of Broadmead Baptist Chapel, Bristol. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1783/', "Thomas Spencer Baynes (1823&#150;1887)")</script>, philosopher and man of letters. Educated at Devonshire College, Bath, he originally intended to enter the medical profession. However, he was prevented by ill health from pursuing the necessary training, and at the age of twenty he joined instead the London firm of Messrs Peto, Brassey, and Betts, where he became private secretary to Sir Samuel Morton Peto (1809&#150;1889), the civil-engineering contractor. In 1860 Peto, who was honorary treasurer of the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS), seconded Baynes to the society to attend to its accounts. Baynes never returned to his original employers, and from this relatively humble beginning as the society's accountant he rose to become finance and minute secretary (1870), co-secretary (1876), and from December 1878 to 1906 general secretary. On his retirement in 1906 he was made honorary secretary of the society.<br>
<br>Baynes presided over a considerable increase in the size and range of operations of the BMS, and thus holds an important place in the story of late-Victorian protestant missionary expansion. Between 1876 and 1906 the missionary force of the society grew from 109 to 170. Baynes encouraged the growth of the society's China mission from a minor enterprise into one of the most significant protestant missionary bodies in China. He was the moving spirit behind the BMS Congo mission, which first became firmly established in 1879 and remained his chief enthusiasm. In association with his two leading missionaries, William Holman Bentley (1855&#150;1905) and George Grenfell (1849&#150;1906), Baynes directed Baptist expansion on the Congo River. He was frequently required to represent the society's interests through contacts with the Foreign Office, Bismarck's German government (in relation to the Cameroons in 1885&#150;7), and King Leopold II of the Belgians. Until 1905, following Grenfell's advice, Baynes was a firm supporter of Leopold's Congo Free State as a guarantee against Portuguese (and hence Roman Catholic) ambitions in central Africa, and he sought to defend Leopold against the mounting volume of criticism directed at the &#145;rubber atrocities&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Baynes disliked &#145;platform work&#146;, he was an effective communicator of missionary enthusiasm to the religious public, especially in relation to central Africa. As a missionary secretary he combined a certain tendency to autocracy with an aversion to rigid regulations, and exuded an infectious optimism.<br>
<br>During his years at the BMS Baynes resided at Putney, London, then at Wandsworth Common, and finally at Eastbourne, Sussex. On 2 September 1874 he married Emma Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of John Bigwood, minister of Onslow Baptist Church, Brompton, London, where Baynes served as a deacon and Sunday school superintendent. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30654/', "Norman Hepburn Baynes (1877&#150;1961)")</script>, Byzantine historian, and one daughter. After his retirement Baynes moved to Fitzwalters, Eastbury Road, Ruislip, Northwood, Middlesex, where he was appointed justice of the peace. He died at his home on 16 October 1914, and was buried at Northwood.<br>
