<span class="headword">Winstanley,  Michael Platt</span>, Baron Winstanley  (1918&#150;1993), <span class="occ">physician, politician, and broadcaster</span>, was born on 27 August 1918 at Green Bank, Willaston, near Nantwich, in Cheshire, the first son and second child of Sydney Adams Winstanley (1878&#150;1953), a doctor in general practice, and his wife, Isabella Beattie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Platt (1883&#150;1948). His father came from engineering stock, an ancestor having been inventor of the Winstanley mining lamp. His mother was Scottish, brought up on the royal estate at Ballater, and an accomplished opera singer. Winstanley was educated at Manchester grammar school and at Manchester University, where he took a medical degree. At university he was president of the union, editor of the university magazine, and captain of the cricket club. His sportsmanship extended well beyond cricket to encompass lacrosse, golf, athletics, rugby, table tennis, and snooker. He later contributed a regular sports column to the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>. On 20 January 1945 he married Nancy Bennett Penney (1920&#150;2001), a fellow physician. Having had one son their marriage was dissolved, in 1952. Winstanley served with the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1946 to 1948 before entering the family practice in Urmston, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Winstanley combined his general practice with work as a medical officer of the Royal Ordnance factory in Patricroft, Lancashire, from 1950 and as a Treasury medical officer and Admiralty surgeon and agent from 1953. On 31 March 1955 he married Joyce Mary Woodhouse (<i>b</i>. 1928), an antiques dealer, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He became heavily involved in the British Medical Association and the Lancashire executive council of the National Health Service, and after 1957 often appeared as Granada television's &#145;screen doctor&#146;. This role and his regular column in the <span class="italic">TV Times</span> reflected his deeply held belief in the importance of health education.<br>
<br>As a well-known active political campaigner not aligned with either of the major parties Winstanley was a prime target for recruitment by Jo Grimond's Liberal Party. He was equally impressed by Grimond's visionary approach and the potential that existed for an energetic expert to have a major impact on Liberal policy. He became a member of the Liberal Party council and was soon selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for Stretford. He took nearly one quarter of the vote in the general election of 1964&#151;a creditable performance&#151;and quickly transferred, as prospective candidate, to the Cheadle division. Cheadle had been the scene of intense Liberal activity at local government level in the early 1960s, and in defeat Roger Cuss had polled the largest Liberal vote in the country&#151;25,220&#151;in 1964. Winstanley's decision to stand in the next general election marked a significant shift in his career away from general practice and towards a new role. Success in 1966 was far from being a foregone conclusion, but his broadcasting work undoubtedly contributed to his victory by 655 votes.<br>
<br>In parliament Winstanley spoke on health, broadcasting, and Post Office questions, and as someone who could get by on little sleep was often called upon to keep the Liberal flag flying in late-night debates. From 1967 to 1970 he was a member of the General Advisory Council of the BBC, and he was also a member of the select committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration. He contributed a chapter on the role of the committee to <span class="italic">The Growth of Parliamentary Scrutiny by Committees</span>, published in 1970, and after his defeat by 1754 votes in the general election of 1970 he continued to focus on citizens' rights. He presented Granada's teatime social action programme &#145;This is your right&#146; from 1970 until stopped by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, before the first 1974 general election. The programme increased his regional profile and generated two books to add to the three earlier medical books that he had written.<br>
<br>Winstanley's television work was a continuation of the work that he undertook on behalf of his constituents. Like all Liberals, by necessity he put much effort into constituency casework, and this helped him to victory in the new Hazel Grove constituency&#151;by 1998 votes&#151;in February 1974. Eight months later his marginal seat was lost again; in 1975 he was elevated to the peerage as Lord Winstanley of Urmston.<br>
<br>Until his death Winstanley was an active member of the Lords, speaking mostly on broadcasting and health and other social issues. An amusing man with a lively speaking style, he could explain difficult or dry subjects using vivid everyday examples. As a peer he also became involved with a number of organizations that represented his wide range of interests, including the Post Office Board and the birth control campaign. He was a director of Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, a founder and chairman of the Groundwork Trust from 1980, president of the Fluoridation Society from 1984, and deputy pro-chancellor of Lancaster University from 1986. He chaired the Countryside Commission from 1978 to 1980, his early departure perhaps reflecting a lack of empathy with the Thatcher government. Winstanley died at his home&#151;93 Bankhall Lane, Hale, Cheshire&#151;on 18 July 1993, after a short battle with prostate cancer, and was cremated eight days later at Altrincham. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Energetic, enthusiastic, imaginative, and down to earth, Winstanley was an enormous asset to the Liberal Party at a time when it could boast few. Had he joined one of the other parties he would have enjoyed a longer career in the House of Commons, although to the detriment of his broadcasting career and the House of Lords, of which he became a member at a relatively early age. On his death his Liberal colleague Richard Wainwright described him as &#145;a model democrat in an age which produced too few of his kind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
