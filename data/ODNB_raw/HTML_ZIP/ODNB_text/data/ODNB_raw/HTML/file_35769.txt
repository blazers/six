<span class="headword">Roberts,  George Henry</span>  (1868&#150;1928), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Chedgrave, near Loddon, Norfolk, on 27 July 1868, the only one of the nine children of George Henry Roberts and his wife, Ann Larkman, to survive beyond infancy. His father was the village shoemaker. When he was five, the family moved to Norwich, where Roberts attended St Stephen's national school. At the age of eleven he held a position of paid monitor in the school, but left at thirteen to be apprenticed to the printing trade, continuing his education at evening classes in the higher grade and technical schools in the city. He completed his apprenticeship in 1889.<br>
<br>As a journeyman printer Roberts worked for a few years in London and joined the London Society of Compositors. He returned to Norwich in 1894 and worked as a compositor then as a foreman printer on a local weekly journal, and was active in trade union affairs. He was president, then secretary (1899&#150;1904), of the Norwich branch of the Typographical Association, and also president, for several years, of the Norwich Trades Council. In November 1895 Roberts married Anna, daughter of Horace Marshall, of Norwich; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Previously a member of Liberal clubs, in the mid-1890s Roberts became active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was the first Labour member to be elected (in 1899) to the Norwich school board. He fought, unsuccessfully, his first contest as a parliamentary Labour candidate at a by-election in Norwich in 1904. His decision to stand against a Liberal candidate who also had the support of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) caused great tension and debate within the LRC. In 1904 he also became an organizer for his union and was strongly backed by it in his successful bid for the Norwich seat in the general election of 1906. He retained his post and salary as organizer after the election. Roberts was already highly regarded within the labour movement as an active, able, and well-informed politician; his standing in the ILP was illustrated by his immediate election as one of its whips in the House of Commons. He was a member of the party's executive committee and an influential leader in the general Labour political movement in the pre-war years.<br>
<br>Roberts was an outspoken critic of what he saw as extremist tendencies in socialist policy, and he moved steadily towards the right wing of Labour politics. He left the ILP in 1914, and entered the Asquith coalition ministry in 1915 as a lord commissioner of the Treasury. In the second coalition ministry, formed by Lloyd George in December 1916, he became parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade; and in the summer of 1917 he was given the post of minister of labour with a seat in the cabinet. But in June 1918 the Labour Party withdrew its support of the coalition government and terminated the political truce which had been observed by all parties during the war. Roberts refused, with two or three other Labour ministers, to withdraw from the coalition, in obedience to the party's decision, emphasizing his defiance by accepting in January 1919 the office of food controller vacated by his colleague J. R. Clynes. He held this office until February 1920, when he resigned from the government.<br>
<br>These actions brought to a head the antagonism that had been developing between Roberts and the Labour Party. His relations with the local party organization had already been strained for some years, and in 1917 the Norwich Labour Party opposed him in the by-election caused by his acceptance of office in the government. In the general election of 1918 Roberts stood as a &#145;coalition labour&#146; candidate and retained his seat at Norwich against the challenge of a local Labour opponent. He successfully held the seat again, as an independent, in the general election of 1922. The following year he moved further to the right of the political spectrum and joined the Conservative Party, but lost his seat in the general election of December 1923. Following this defeat he withdrew from politics and turned his attention to business, becoming a director of several companies and taking an active interest in the development of the English beet sugar industry.<br>
<br>Roberts's political evolution was directed to some extent by his temperament, which made him sensitive to rivalry within or criticism by the party organization at Norwich. But he was also genuinely opposed to what he saw as tendencies towards revolutionary doctrine with the Labour Party. What drove him finally into Conservatism was his belief that the trade union movement had also become overly influenced by policies of direct action and social rebellion, as a result of the socialist propaganda of the ILP. Roberts became a privy councillor on his acceptance of a position in the first coalition ministry (1915), and in 1918 received the freedom of Norwich, where he resided for nearly the whole of his life. He died of heart failure at a hotel, Edenhurst, in Sevenoaks, Kent, on 25 April 1928, while on a business trip. He was buried in Norwich on 30 April after a service at St Thomas's Church. He was survived by his wife.<br>
