<span class="headword">Wihtred</span>  (<em>d.</em> 725), <span class="occ">king of Kent</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54039/', "Ecgberht I (d. 673)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39239/', "Eorcenberht")</script>] and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52302/', "Eadric (d. 686)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39262/', "Hlothhere")</script>], both rulers in Kent. For several years after Eadric's death Kent had been at the mercy of foreign invaders, who had set their own candidates on the throne: Mul (<i>r</i>. 686&#150;7), brother of the West Saxon king C&aelig;dwalla; Sw&aelig;fheard (<i>r</i>. 687/8&#150;<i>c</i>.692), son of the East Saxon king S&aelig;bbi; and Oswine (<i>r</i>. 688/9&#150;690?), backed by the Mercian king &AElig;thelred. Eventually Wihtred managed to build up enough support to make good his claims to the kingship. In July 692 Sw&aelig;fheard and Wihtred were ruling together in Kent; they may have been joint rulers, or the kingdom may have been divided between them. Bede's calculations about the length of Wihtred's reign suggest that he first came to power in the autumn of 690, but some of Wihtred's charters indicate that the beginning of his reign was usually reckoned from the summer or autumn of 691. By 694 Sw&aelig;fheard had disappeared from the scene, for in a charter of that year Wihtred made a grant of land without reference to a joint ruler, and explicitly gave thanks to God &#145;who has extended our boundaries as they were in our father's time&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 15). In this charter, Wihtred's wife Cynegyth is presented as co-donor; no earlier Kentish queen had been given this status in a charter, and after Wihtred's reign they once more sink into obscurity, so it may have been the case that Cynegyth was given additional importance because Wihtred relied on the support of her kindred.<br>
<br>In the early years of Wihtred's sole reign there is evidence for close relations between Kent and Wessex. In 694 the people of Kent &#145;made terms with Ine&#146; (king of the West Saxons from 688 to 726) and presented him with 30,000 pence in compensation for the killing of the West Saxon usurper Mul in 687  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 694); it may be significant that the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> links this event with Wihtred's succession to the kingdom of Kent. Either in 695 or in 696 Wihtred proclaimed a set of laws in the course of a Kentish assembly at an unidentified place called &#145;Berghamstyde&#146;. In comparison with other seventh-century law-codes, Wihtred's laws seem particularly preoccupied with ecclesiastical matters, such as the position of the church and churchmen in secular society, and the enforcement of lay observance of ecclesiastical rules. Towards the end Wihtred turns to the more worldly matter of the treatment of thieves, and closes with a prescription that strangers and foreigners should keep to the road or be assumed to be thieves. Remarkably this same provision is to be found in the law code of King Ine (issued between 688 and 694), which implies that the two rulers had come to some agreement about the treatment of foreigners in their respective kingdoms.<br>
<br>After its difficult beginning, Wihtred's long reign seems to have been remarkably uneventful; but the sources are poor for this period and certain triumphs and calamities may have slipped from the record. It has been suggested that in the 690s the kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England arrived at an involuntary balance of power, which led to a period of relative stability; Northumbria was in decline and Mercia was deterred from trying to conquer south-eastern England by the existence of strong kings (with a mutual understanding) in Wessex and Kent. Possibly this impression of relative peace is a product of inadequate source material; there is a hint of troubles in the preamble of the grant of privileges which Wihtred made to the Kentish churches in 699. Nevertheless, it is clear that Wihtred must have been a very able (or very fortunate) king to rule the wealthy kingdom of Kent for more than thirty years, apparently without challenge, and to be able to hand it on to his sons. He may well have made judicious use of alliances, regularly cemented by marriage. His first wife, Cynegyth, seems to have died or to have been repudiated very quickly, for in a charter of 696 there is a new royal consort named &AElig;thelburh, again presented as co-donor of the estate; she appears prominently in Wihtred's other charters from the late 690s. Towards the end of his reign Wihtred was associated with a third queen, named W&aelig;rburh, who attested with her husband and her son Alric the proceedings of a synod that took place at Bapchild, probably in 716  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 22); the charter as it stands is spurious, but the forger has made use of witness lists from a genuine document or documents. Wihtred also seems to have strengthened his position by winning the firm support of the Kentish churches. In his law code he exempted them from the payment of royal tribute, a concession strengthened by a charter of privileges issued in 699. He is also known to have made land grants to the monastery of St Peter and St Paul (later St Augustine's) in Canterbury, and to the ministers in Thanet and Lyminge; in some late sources he is remembered as the founder of the minster at Dover.<br>
<br>Wihtred died on 23 April 725 and was buried in St Mary's Church in the monastery of St Peter and St Paul, Canterbury. He was succeeded by his three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52310/', "&#198;thelberht II (d. 762)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57716/', "Eadberht I")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52310/', "&#198;thelberht II")</script>], and Alric. Nothing more is heard of Alric after Wihtred's death, which suggests that he may have been denied power by his half-brothers (he was evidently the son of a different wife, W&aelig;rburh); his elder brothers ruled jointly until Eadberht's death in 748.<br>
