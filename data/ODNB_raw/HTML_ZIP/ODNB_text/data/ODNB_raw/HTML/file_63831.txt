<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Russell, Sir  (Edward) Lionel</span>  (1903&#150;1983), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born at 35 Sotheby Road, Islington, London, on 8 May 1903, the son of Edward Russell, an analytical chemist, and his wife, Kate. He was educated at Clifton College and at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he gained a first in part one of the mathematical tripos (1923) and a second in English (1925). Following a lectureship at the University of Lund, Sweden (1925&#150;31), and a period as assistant master at Charterhouse School (1932&#150;5), Russell moved into local education authority administration, as assistant director of education in Liverpool (1935&#150;8), the career he was to follow for the rest of his life. He was assistant education officer in Birmingham (1938&#150;46) and chief education officer for the city from 1946 to 1968.<br>
<br>A manager rather than an educational theorist, Russell was soon recognized as an astute and reliable administrator with a practical and humane approach to educational policy. At Birmingham he instituted a strong sense of civic pride and emphasized the obligations of the education service to the city and its inhabitants. He acquired a reputation as a demanding chief, committed to the highest standards and to meticulous administrative efficiency. Throughout his career he had a strong interest in and commitment to adult and further education. He was closely involved, for example, in the evolution of the University of Aston (1966) from its origins in the Birmingham College of Technology.<br>
<br>Nationally, Russell was from the 1950s onwards a prominent member of influential public bodies concerned with education: the University Grants Committee (1954&#150;63), the Council for National Academic Awards (1964&#150;70), and, as president, the Association of Chief Education Officers (1955&#150;7). He was called upon frequently as a private adviser to education ministers and was seen as a wise counsel and a safe pair of hands. It was therefore no surprise when in 1969 he was invited by the secretary of state for education, Ted Short, to chair a committee of inquiry to review the provision of non-vocational adult education in England and Wales. However, by the time the report, entitled <span class="italic">Adult Education: a Plan for Development</span>, appeared in 1973, the political situation had changed markedly (Margaret Thatcher was now secretary of state for education in Edward Heath's Conservative government), and economic crisis was imminent.<br>
<br>Events therefore overtook and effectively submerged what was in reality a reasonable, practical, and mildly progressive programme for adult education recommended by the report. The Russell report suggested no fundamental changes to structures or provision, but rather a general expansion, a greater emphasis upon adult education in the further education sector, and a higher priority in the adult education provision of the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) and the universities for work with disadvantaged communities. With some prescience, given the emphasis upon lifelong learning in the later 1990s and beyond, Russell envisaged a more accessible, flexible, inclusive, and learner-centred system of post-compulsory education and training.<br>
<br>At the time, however, the Russell report and the liberal, welfare state world view it reflected, was overwhelmed by larger forces. Adult education in all sectors was fundamentally and systematically undermined through the late 1970s and the 1980s by a series of spending cuts and restructuring. Despite rhetorical support for adult education and its liberating mission, none of the political parties gave material support to adult education as such, let alone to the modest developmental proposals of the report. It was not only ignored, in effect, by the political parties: the professional field was generally critical of Russell's perceived caution and pragmatic, evolutionary tenor. Through the 1970s, therefore, the report had few friends. However, with the hindsight of almost thirty years, the report and its recommendations had considerable resonance.<br>
<br>Russell's professional values and personal qualities were well symbolized by the report's pragmatic liberalism. He was a very private man, dedicated to liberal educational values and the highest standards of public service. He was meticulous and particular, not least in the drafting of documents, and was well known for ravaging the drafts of his subordinates. He was a rather heavy, formal, and seemingly austere figure. Yet his shyness concealed a kindly and considerate man who treated with courtesy everyone with whom he had contact.<br>
<br>One of the leading figures in English education during the quarter of a century following the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, Russell was appointed CBE in 1953 and knighted in 1962. He never married. One of his few interests outside his work was cricket, for which he had a passion, particularly in Gloucestershire. He died at Manor Park Hospital, Bristol, on 26 December 1983.<br>
