</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Casement,  Roger David</span>  (1864&#150;1916), <span class="occ">diplomatist and Irish rebel</span>, was born on 1 September 1864 at Doyle's Cottage, Lawson Terrace, Sandymount, near Dublin, the youngest son of Captain Roger Casement (1819&#150;1877) of the 3rd dragoon guards. His father was of Ulster protestant stock and his mother, Anne Jephson (1834&#150;1873), was of a Roman Catholic branch of a protestant family from Mallow, co. Cork. The children were brought up as protestants, though his mother had Roger secretly baptized a Roman Catholic in Rhyl, north Wales, in August 1868. The Casements moved about frequently, living in France, Italy, and St Helier, Jersey. Casement's mother died in childbirth in 1873, and his father in 1877. The children became wards in chancery, and were dependent on their relatives, especially their uncle, John Casement, of Magherintemple, near Ballycastle, co. Antrim.<br>
<br>Casement lived with his uncle and was sent as a boarder to the diocesan school, Ballymena, in 1873. He left school in 1880 and there followed twelve years of peripatetic living. Casement went to Liverpool to live with Grace Bannister, his mother's sister, and her family. He was found a position as clerk in the Elder Dempster shipping line company, which was active in west Africa. But he found office work tedious and when only nineteen he became purser on the <i>Bonny</i>, an Elder Dempster ship bound for the Congo.<h2>
<a name="BritishconsulAfricaandSouthAmerica"></a>British consul: Africa and South America</h2>In 1884 Casement returned to Africa and stayed, with only brief intervals, for nearly twenty years. Between 1884 and 1889 he worked in various employments, travelling and acting as &#145;surveyor&#146; on behalf of the commercial interests of several countries working under King Leopold of the Belgians' Congo International Association. Between December 1889 and March 1890 he was companion to Herbert Ward on a lecturing tour in the United States of America. In 1892 he returned to Ireland and in the same year he accepted his first British official post on the Gulf of Guinea, functioning as &#145;travelling commissioner and in other capacities for the government&#146;. By October 1892 he was signing himself &#145;Acting Director-general of Customs&#146;  (Reid, 17). His first consular appointment came in 1895 at Delagoa Bay on Delagoa Bay in Portuguese East Africa, and in July 1898 he was given a new appointment as consul for the Portuguese possessions in west Africa south of the Gulf of Guinea, to reside at Luanda. He was given further consular responsibility for the Congo state and Gabon. At this point in his career he was stridently pro-British, fulminating against the Boers and Kruger, and was awarded the queen's South Africa medal, but he showed signs of his later involvement in Ireland when he tried, unsuccessfully, to have a collection of poems, &#145;The Dream of the Celt&#146; published by T. Fisher Unwin in 1901. His interest in Africa was still paramount, and he hoped that the Congo, if it were to be governed by Belgium, would be subject to a &#145;European authority responsible to public opinion, and not to the unquestioned rule of an autocrat whose chief preoccupation is that autocracy should be profitable&#146;  (ibid., 32).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1902 Casement persuaded the Foreign Office to move him to Boma, near the Congo mouth. It was at this stage that his homosexual relationships were first entered in his diaries. In June 1902 the Foreign Office authorized him to go into the interior and send reports on the misgovernment of the Congo. He amassed evidence of cruelty and even mutilation of the natives. In November 1903 he was recalled to London to write up his report, which condemned the Congo administration as a ruthless enterprise. His report had less impact that he had hoped, and he was disappointed that the British government did not set up consular courts to protect its own subjects in the Congo. But he was rewarded for his work with a CMG in 1905, which he accepted, though with some misgivings, for he was now more involved in Irish nationalism, particularly the Gaelic League, founded by Douglas Hyde and others in 1892 to further Irish culture and language.<br>
<br>In May 1904 Casement walked the Glens of Antrim and was busy learning Irish, a &#145;delightful study&#146;  (Reid, 61). He hoped to work out a future for himself in Ireland as one of those &#145;men of leisure, who would love her [Ireland] for herself&#146;  (ibid., 73) and give to Ireland what the English aristocracy gave to English public life, but he was poor, and he had to find more remunerative employment. He informed London in September 1905 that he was seeking a position, but his brief stay in one of the best consular posts, Lisbon, and his refusal of Bilbao, annoyed the Foreign Office and he was obliged to wait. In July 1906 he received overtures from the Foreign Office, and in August he was offered the consular post at Santos, Brazil. &#145;I am a queer sort of British consul&#146; he mused, one who &#145;ought really to be in jail instead of under the Lion &amp; Unicorn&#146;  (ibid., 79). He hated Santos, and a visit to Ireland in 1907 reinforced his rather incoherent, but increasingly fervent, desire to do something for Ireland. In November he left Santos for Par&aacute;, which he disliked even more, showing an aversion to the Brazilians because of their mixed race&#151;a &#145;human compost&#146;  (ibid., 86), as he called them, but his improved financial position enabled him to donate money to Irish causes.<br>
<br>In 1908 Casement went to Rio as consul-general, and in the following year began to show a revived interest in his work, through investigating atrocities in the Putumayo basin in Peru. The Foreign Office decided that an investigation into abuses there was needed and Casement was the obvious choice, in view of his Congo experience and the high regard in which humanitarian societies in England held him. On 13 July 1910 his appointment was confirmed and he showed his great competence through a careful study of the papers, his thoroughness in investigation, and the indignation with which he described human rights abuses. He wrote up his report in 1911 and it was subsequently published as a blue book. Casement was rewarded with a knighthood (1911), which, like his CMG, occasioned some self-reflection. He naturally wished to accept the honour, but he worried about its reception in Irish nationalist circles. His response was open to criticism. He accepted, writing in fulsome terms to the foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, while confessing to Alice Stopford Green (another protestant nationalist), &#145;How I should have rejoiced if I could have said to the King what is really in my heart instead of the perfunctory words of thanks (cold and formal enough)&#146;  (Inglis, 188).<h2>
<a name="Irishrebel"></a>Irish rebel</h2>Casement was now at the height of his British official career; but there remained a void in his life, which was soon filled by Ireland. In 1912 two decisions reflected this mood. He became patron of the Irish summer school on Tawin island, co. Galway; and he wrote in reply to a request from the headmaster of his old school in Ballymena for a subscription to a school extension fund that &#145;I should be glad to help &hellip; were I sure it was not to help an institution that was doing its share to denationalise my fellow-countrymen&#146;  (Parmiter, 95). In that same year Irish politics entered a new and dangerous phase, when the Ulster unionists pledged themselves to resist the imposition of home rule, by force if necessary. Casement, like many nationalists, was radicalized by the crisis. In 1913 he became a member of the provisional committee set up to act as the governing body of the Irish Volunteer Force (IVF), created to emulate the Ulster Volunteer Force, but to defend the cause of home rule. His belief in Germany as the obstacle to the machinations of the British empire now found vocal expression: &#145;Oh! How I sometimes in my heart long for the thud of the German boot keeping guard outside the Mother of Parliaments&#146;, he wrote to Mrs Green in November 1913  (Reid, 184). He helped organize local IVF units, and in May 1914 he declared that &#145;It is quite clear to every Irishman that the only rule John Bull respects is the rifle&#146;, hoping that he could make the solution of the &#145;English Question&#146; the &#145;chief case of Europe&#146;  (Sawyer, <span class="italic">Casement</span>, 114).<h2>
<a name="GermanyandtherisinginIreland"></a>Germany and the rising in Ireland</h2>On 2 July 1914 Casement set off for the United States to raise support for the IVF. When the First World War broke out in August he resolved to travel to Germany via Norway in order to urge on the Germans the &#145;grand idea&#146; of forming an &#145;Irish brigade&#146; consisting of Irish prisoners of war to fight for Ireland and for Germany  (Sawyer, <span class="italic">Casement</span>, 115), since Germany was &#145;fighting the battle of European civilization&#146;  (Reid, 203). By now British intelligence was on Casement's trail, and was becoming aware of his homosexual proclivities. Casement arrived in Berlin on 31 October and negotiated what he called a treaty, of ten articles, one of which stated that in no circumstances would the Irish brigade fight directly for Germany, thus avoiding a charge of treason. But Casement's German experience was an unhappy one. He felt slighted that a man of his stature should not be received by the chancellor, von Bethmann-Hollweg, and his attempts to persuade Irish prisoners to enlist in his brigade met with a poor response. His arrogance surfaced in his description of the Irish soldiers as having &#145;retaliated in a manner characteristic of their class&#146;  (Sawyer, <span class="italic">Casement</span>, 118), and in his anger at being mistaken for an Englishman; he dismissed them as &#145;Englishmen, pure and simple&#146;  (ibid., 122). Ireland became more of an abstraction to him, the &#145;poor old woman&#146; whose &#145;four Green fields&#146;  (ibid., 119) must be redeemed. His homosexual activity became more overt, troubling his hosts. He returned the insignia of his decorations to the British, but he confessed that he was &#145;very lonely often&#146; and wished that he had a father and a mother &#145;to go to now&#146;  (Reid, 241); a young Irishman who had been interned and then released by the Germans described him as &#145;unhinged&#146;  (ibid., 291).<br>
<br>The contacts between Irish separatists who were planning a rising and Germany came to Casement's attention only through Robert Monteith, who had served in the British army in the South African War, and was now in Germany to enlist in the Irish brigade. Monteith was informed of the plan on 4 or 5 March 1916, and told Casement that a &#145;move&#146; was on, asking him to come to Berlin to discuss the details  (Reid, 329). Casement's old energy and animation revived, but he was shocked to learn that the Germans had, as their foreign office representative Nadolny remarked to Casement, &#145;no idealistic interest in Ireland &hellip; if it were not that we hope for a diversion there, we should not give the rifles&#146;  (McHugh, 182). There would be no German soldiers, no officers sent to Ireland, yet Casement was told that the rising was seen in terms of compelling England &#145;to surrender to us!!&#146;  (Reid, 330). Casement now resolved on the contradictory objects of making sure that Germany supplied rifles to the separatists; but also of preventing the rising taking place at all. He decided to go to Ireland, but the Irish-American nationalist John Devoy, who always had his doubts about Casement, tried to ensure that he stayed in Germany.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1916 Casement was told that he could go, but final arrangements were delayed until 6.30 p.m. on 7 April, when he was informed that a submarine would be provided to take him to the west coast of Ireland, where he would rendezvous with a ship carrying arms. Casement was overjoyed. The <i>Aud</i>, carrying the weapons, set out from L&uuml;beck on 9 April with instructions to land the arms at Tralee Bay between 20 and 23 April. On 12 April Casement set out in a submarine which broke down, and he was transferred to another U-boat. The <i>Aud</i> was at its rendezvous on 21 April but the two vessels failed to meet because of an error in navigation. The U-boat waited, but then Casement and two companions, Monteith and David Julian Bailey, embarked in a dinghy and landed, exhausted, on Banna strand in the small hours of 21 April. Monteith described them as &#145;three men in a boat&#151;the smallest invading party known to history&#146;  (Reid, 351). The fugitives&#151;for that is what they were&#151;were arrested by the police and Casement was held in Tralee police barracks, where he called for a priest and urged him to carry a message to Dublin emphasizing the futility of a rising. He was taken to Dublin and then London, where he was lodged in the Tower in room 2A. He was given a preliminary examination by magistrates at Bow Street on 15 May, transferred to Brixton prison, and then committed for trial.<h2>
<a name="Trialandexecution"></a>Trial and execution</h2>Casement surmised that the British, while finding him guilty of treason, would not dare hang him, following the adverse reaction to their executions of ringleaders of the rising. The trial began on 26 June with F. E. Smith leading for the crown. But the most controversial aspect of the trial took place outside the courts. Casement's diaries, detailing his homosexual activities, were now in the hands of the British police and intelligence officers shortly after Casement's interrogation at Scotland Yard on 23 April. There are several versions about precisely when and how the diaries were discovered, but they seem to have come to light when Casement's London lodgings were searched following his arrest. By the first weeks of May they were beginning to be used surreptitiously against him. They were shown to British and American press representatives on about 3 May and excerpts were soon widely circulated in London clubs and the House of Commons. This could not have been done without at least an expectation that those higher up would approve, though Smith opposed any use of the diaries to discredit Casement's reputation, as did Sir Edward Grey. The cabinet however made no attempt to stop these activities, the purpose of which was not to ensure that Casement would be hanged&#151;that was inevitable&#151;but that he should be hanged in disgrace, both political and moral.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1916 Casement was found guilty of high treason. He made a speech from the dock, which was unremarkable except for its significance in showing how he had accepted the mantle of Irish nationalist martyrdom. He was removed to Pentonville prison to await execution. On 30 June he was stripped of his knighthood and on 24 July an appeal was rejected. A campaign for a reprieve was supported by leading political and literary figures, including W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy, and Arthur Conan Doyle, but not only the British, but the Irish public remained unmoved. Mrs Green admitted on 19 July that it was indeed true that &#145;Ireland does not care about this case&#146;  (Reid, 413). America also was unconcerned.<h2>
<a name="TheCasementdiaries"></a>The Casement diaries</h2>Before his execution at Pentonville prison on 3 August, Casement was received into the Roman Catholic church, having declared himself ready to die &#145;a glorious death, for Ireland's sake&#146;  (Inglis, 370). But the contents of his diaries were more controversial than his martyrdom. The British continued to use them to discredit Casement after his death; Alfred Noyes, on a visit to the United States in the winter of 1916, referred to Casement as having touched &#145;the lowest depths that human degradation has ever touched&#146;  (ibid., 377). Irish nationalists, for their part, denied that the diaries were genuine, thus implying that no real Irish patriot could be a homosexual. The diaries were opened to public inspection by R. A. Butler in 1959.<br>
<br>The controversy over the authenticity of the Casement diaries continues. Recently Angus Mitchell has made strenuous efforts to discredit them, claiming that they &#145;were manufactured in an age when acts of homosexuality were considered sexually degenerate&#146;, and that &#145;painstaking analysis&#146;, including the use of computerized analysis of key words and expressions, proves that the diaries were forged  (Mitchell, 9). But Mitchell undermines his case by claiming that they were forged, not only to discredit Casement because of his treason, but also because of his Putumayo report. Thus the diaries, Mitchell alleges, enabled the British to divert attention from the inquiry, which they found damaging because of their own involvement in South America. But since the inquiry report was published in 1912, it seems unlikely that the forgers would wait until 1916 to publish their work. Roger Sawyer's explanation is more convincing. The problem with accepting the diaries' authenticity is, he points out, compounded by the fact that Sir Basil Thomson, in British intelligence, offered two different accounts of when the diaries were first discovered. The first was that they were found in the Easter weekend of 1916; the second, that they were found &#145;some months earlier, when we first had evidence of Casement's treachery&#146;  (Sawyer, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 9). Sawyer concludes that Thomson's contradictory statements are characteristic of history written from memory, and concludes that the diaries are genuine. Certainly the British authorities had enough evidence, gathered from decoders in Room 40 of the Admiralty old building, to convict Casement of treason; they hardly needed to begin work on a forgery as early as 1914. The motivation for publishing the diaries, Sawyer argues, was because the British realized that, having executed the leaders of the Easter rising, they must prevent Casement from achieving martyr status. And of course the diaries could hardly have been forged in the short time available during Casement's trial and execution. Discrepancies in the handwriting can be attributed to Casement's returning to the diaries to revisit his sexual encounters. Moreover, he may have fantasized about some of the incidents recorded in the diaries. As Sawyer points out, it is hardly likely that a forger would have included a reference to homosexuality as a &#145;terrible disease&#146;; and, in any case, if the diaries were indeed forgeries, it would have made more sense for the British to destroy them once they had accomplished their purpose. Sawyer's conclusion, that the &#145;complexity of insider detail&#146;  (ibid., 25) bears out their authenticity, is hard to refute. A reading of the published 1910 diary is convincing evidence that it is genuine; the nature of the text, the jottings, the sense of a man writing about what came from his nature, attest to the diary's authenticity. Forensic tests carried out in 2002 by the Giles document laboratory, commissioned by Professor Bill McCormack of Goldsmiths' College, University of London, provided further&#151;and surely final&#151;proof that the diaries are genuine.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>It is all too easy to make connections between Casement's homosexuality and his treason, citing the apparently parallel cases of the Cambridge Apostles and the like. But Casement made little secret of his growing disenchantment with the British empire, and because he was, as Joseph Conrad remarked, &#145;all emotion&#146;  (Reid, 15), his hatred of England soon dominated his life, as did his rather abstract love of Ireland. The key to his personality lies not in his sexual choices, but in his Anglo-Irish background, and his behaviour is more readily understood in the context of the Anglo-Irishman in revolt against the English part of his inheritance. His forebears are Robert Emmet and William Smith O'Brien, rebels against the English part of their Anglo-Irish nature, for Casement's outlook was essentially that of an Irish protestant, despite his brief encounters with Catholicism.<br>
<br>Casement's remains were returned to Ireland on 23 February 1965 and on 1 March reinterred in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, with full nationalist ceremony; his nearest relatives in Ireland ignored the rites. Casement met a last, equally significant fate at the hands of the country he once served. His <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry was not transferred into the <span class="italic">Who Was Who</span> volume after his death. He became in this sense a non-person, which was a measure of the hatred that he inspired in the British establishment. And yet Stephen Gwynn's <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry of 1927 concluded that &#145;those who knew Roger Casement knew him to be honourable and chivalrous as well as able far beyond the ordinary measure of men&#146;. It is this difference in perception between contemporaries who saw him as a fighter for human rights on the one hand, and a traitor to the country that honoured him with a knighthood, only to see that betrayed, on the other, that ensures that not only Casement, but his diaries, will remain a matter of the most profound controversy.<br>
