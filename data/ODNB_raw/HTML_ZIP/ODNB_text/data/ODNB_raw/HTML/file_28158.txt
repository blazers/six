<span class="headword">Vautrollier,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was born in Troyes, France. He was among the large number of French immigrants who came to England at the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth. After settling in London, he soon found employment in the book trade, first as a bookbinder and then as a bookseller in partnership with another French immigrant, Jean Desserans. He was granted letters of denization on 9 March 1562, and was admitted as a &#145;brother&#146; (a form of associate membership) of the Stationers' Company on 2 October 1564  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.279). As only a brother rather than a full freeman, Vautrollier was technically not allowed to operate a printing press without direct permission from the crown. Nevertheless, he was printing from 1570 when he dissolved the partnership with Desserans and began to print on his own account, beginning a thoroughly successful career that won him a reputation as one of London's most accomplished printers. Between 1570 and 1587 he published some 150 books, including a number of extremely rich and lavish volumes: the tax assessments on his property in the Blackfriars reveal that this work also brought him considerable prosperity.<br>
<br>The first book entered by Vautrollier in the Stationers' Company registers was a writing book of the French schoolmaster Jean de Beauchesne which was published in 1570 (the first such writing book to be published in England). This first project set the tone for his future career in several important respects. From this point Vautrollier would establish an important niche market, bringing to the English public translations of books from the French; these ranged from Beauchesne, through the poetry of Guillaume du Bartas, to political tracts such as the life of the martyred Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny. Vautrollier also brought to the Beauchesne project the typographical sophistication and style that would characterize all of his work and exploit his connections with the sophisticated European book world. In London, Vautrollier functioned from an early stage as an agent for the Antwerp printer Christopher Plantin, though his own printing types were obtained from two French giants of the art, Robert Granjon and Claude Garamond. Vautrollier also patronized the influential Huguenot designer Pierre Haultin, whose nephew Jerome was working in England at this time.<br>
<br>Vautrollier was deeply committed to the protestant church. In London, like so many of his co-religionists, he joined the French stranger church (to which he would leave &pound;3 at his death), and a number of his most important projects reveal his close ties to the protestant hierarchy. In 1574 he published an English translation of Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, the first of a number of Calvin editions that included four editions of this work in Latin. At a time when demand for Latin books was still overwhelmingly met by imports Vautrollier was one of the few printers with the confidence and resources to take on such a substantial project, in this case in partnership with the English author and theologian Edmund Bunny. Vautrollier also published an edition of Bunny's hugely popular abridgement of the <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. More singular still was Vautrollier's initiative in publishing a series of the work of Martin Luther, in most cases the first editions of Luther's biblical commentaries for many years. To Vautrollier falls much of the credit for keeping Luther in the public eye during an era when Calvinist theology ruled the roost. Vautrollier's work and protestant sympathies won approval in high places and valuable official patronage.<br>
<br>In April 1573 Vautrollier was granted a ten-year patent for two Latin texts, and the following year, on 19 June 1574, he received a further ten-year privilege to print a number of Latin works, including Beza's Latin <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and works by Cicero, Ovid, and Pierre Ramus; he was allowed to employ &#145;six woorkemen Ffrenchmen or Du[t]chemen&#146; to help him  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.746). As this suggests, Vautrollier continued to specialize in educational books, through which he established (particularly with the privilege for the modish Ramus) close connections with Cambridge University. He also continued to print primers and schoolbooks for elementary education, particularly the work of the French schoolmaster Claude Holyband.<br>
<br>The growth of Vautrollier's business caused predictable tensions with competitors in the London publishing trade. In 1578 he was fined 10<i>s</i>. for printing the <span class="italic">Special and Chosen Sermons of Dr Martin Luther</span> without licence, the first of a number of bruising encounters with the regulatory authorities. One such clash led to his temporarily withdrawing from London and settling in Scotland during the 1580s after he had incurred the displeasure of the privy council for printing the work of the visionary Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno. The departure north was not, however, unprepared. Vautrollier's connections with Scotland were of sufficiently long standing to make him fully aware of the commercial opportunities north of the border. In 1577 he had printed two books for the Scottish bookseller Henry Charteris and by 1580 he was systematically engaged in the book trade in Edinburgh. In that year the town council of Edinburgh demanded from him payment for books he had imported from London. In 1582 a complaint was made against him for retailing and binding books while not free of the burgh. But in Scotland, too, Vautrollier had friends in high places. He supplied schoolbooks to James VI through his tutor Peter Young, and in 1580 the general assembly of the Church of Scotland had recommended that he be given licence and privilege to print in Scotland, arguing the &#145;great necessity of a printer within this country&#146;. Vautrollier set out for Scotland in the spring of 1583, only for the ships in which he had entrusted his precious cargo of books and printing materials to be waylaid and plundered by pirates. Vautrollier persevered and with official encouragement eight books were published under his name in Edinburgh in 1584. But even with royal patronage, there seems to have been insufficient business to justify his remaining there, and the following year he returned to London.<br>
<br>In a 1582 report on printing privileges, Christopher Barker, the queen's printer, felt Vautrollier was not fully exploiting his patents, and that &#145;he doth yet, neither great good, nor great harme withall&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.144). This did not prevent a 1582&#150;3 privy council commission into the printing trade recommending that Vautrollier's patent be opened up in order to benefit poorer printers. In 1583 and 1586 his London printing house was recorded as operating two printing presses. His wife, Jacqueline (<i>d</i>. after 1588), seems to have been an active member of the business; on 17 July 1581 she was granted permission by the Stationers' Company to finish printing an edition of Cicero &#145;in her husbandes absence&#146;  (Greg and Boswell, 11).<br>
<br>In 1583 Vautrollier was noted as being infirm, but he did not die until some point between 10 July 1587 when he drew up his will and 22 July 1587 when the will was proved. He bequeathed to his son Manassess the press he had used in Edinburgh; three other children, Thomas (who later became a bookseller in London), Simon, and James, were also mentioned in the will. Jacqueline continued the business on her own for a short time, although on 4 March 1588 the Stationers' Company ordered that she &#145;shall not at anye tyme or tymes hereafter prynte anye manner of Booke or Bookes whatsoeu[r], as well by Reason that her husband at the tyme of his decease was noe prynter&#146;; shortly afterwards she married Richard Field, a former apprentice of her husband, in whose name the printing business was carried on  (Greg and Boswell, 26).<br>
