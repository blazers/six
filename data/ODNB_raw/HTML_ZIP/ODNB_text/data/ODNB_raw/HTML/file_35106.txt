<span class="headword">Moriarty,  Henry Augustus</span>  (1815&#150;1906), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the second son of Commander James Moriarty RN, and his wife, Catherine Webb, was born on 19 May 1815 in the signal tower on Valentia Island, co. Cork, Ireland. He was educated by the Revd J. Neave at Portsmouth, and entered the navy on 18 December 1829 on board the frigate <i>North Star</i>. In 1837 he was promoted second master and appointed to the flagship <i>Caledonia</i> in the Mediterranean, and during the war on the coast of Syria in 1840 served on board the <i>Ganges</i> (84 guns). He was promoted master in June 1844, and in 1848, while master of the flagship <i>Penelope</i> on the west coast of Africa, commanded a paddle-box boat in an expedition to destroy the slave barracoons on the River Gallinas. In the Crimean War he was master of the <i>Duke of Wellington</i>, the flagship of Sir Charles Napier, in the Baltic; he was mentioned in dispatches for surveying work done under fire, and was employed under Captain Bartholomew J. Sulivan in placing the mortar vessels preparatory to the bombardment of Sveaborg on 9 August 1855.<br>
<br>In 1857 and in 1858 Moriarty was appointed to navigate the battleship <i>Agamemnon</i>, lent by the Admiralty to lay the first Atlantic telegraph cable. In June 1863 he was promoted staff commander, and in August was appointed to the flagship <i>Marlborough</i> (121 guns) in the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>In 1865 and 1866 Moriarty navigated the <i>Great Eastern</i> when she was employed in laying the second and third transatlantic cables, and, when the cable broke in mid-ocean in 1865, he fixed the position so accurately as to ensure the subsequent recovery of the broken end. In 1866 he was created CB for this success, and received a valuable testimonial from his brother officers. In December 1867 he was promoted staff captain and was appointed to Portsmouth Dockyard as assistant master attendant; in November 1869 he became master attendant and queen's harbour master. He held this post until 3 December 1874, when he was placed on the retired list with the rank of captain.<br>
<br>After his retirement Moriarty was occasionally employed as nautical assessor to the judicial committee of the privy council, and frequently as nautical expert before parliamentary committees, including those on Barry docks, the Tay Bridge, the Forth Bridge, and Tower Bridge. His chief publications were four volumes of sailing directions (1887&#150;93) compiled for the Admiralty, and the articles on seamanship and navigation in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn).<br>
<br>Moriarty married first, on 30 July 1852, Lavinia Charlotte (<i>d</i>. September 1874), the daughter of William Page Foster; they had two sons and two daughters. His second wife, whom he married in 1875, was Harriet Elizabeth, the daughter of Robert Avent of St Budeaux, Devon, who died childless in March 1892. Moriarty died at his home, 35 Manor Park, Lee, Kent, on 18 August 1906, and was buried in the cemetery there.<br>
