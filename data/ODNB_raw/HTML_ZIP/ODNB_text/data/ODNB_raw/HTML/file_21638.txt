<span class="headword">Pay <span class="st"> [Paye]</span>,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Arripay]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1419), <span class="occ">shipmaster</span>, of Poole, Dorset, acquired a considerable reputation in the early fifteenth century because of his exploits in the seas off the south and west coasts of England. His enemies, especially those from Castile, bluntly called him a corsair, but at times he may well have been acting on his understanding of royal policy which only resolutely condemned attacks on the goods and ships of friendly aliens.<br>
<br>Acting with a small squadron of balingers and barges, the swift manoeuvrable vessels used for this kind of action, Pay was involved in 1402 in the capture of a Bremen ship with a rich cargo of Mediterranean goods including Valencian saffron, dates, and some barrels of &#145;prime sack&#146;. In the next two years he seemed to prey particularly on Spanish vessels from Bilbao laden with iron bars, though in 1404 a mule, two silver girdles, and rich robes worth a total of 5000 nobles were also in the cargo. He seems often to have scoured the seas in the company of ships from Dartmouth and Kingswear, being on one occasion, in March 1404, the master of a barge belonging to the redoubtable John Hawley from the same town. His exploits sometimes show an element of bold daring; there is a chronicler's story of how Pay himself was boarded at sea by some Norman seamen and overpowered. The English crew were tied up on deck and their captors went below to look for booty, having first removed their armour because it was a very hot day. Pay and his men managed to free themselves and in their turn overpowered and killed their erstwhile captors in the hold. With his own vessel and the Norman prize Pay then sailed up the Seine showing French flags and burnt several small ships before escaping safely to the open sea.<br>
<br>The Castilians were more in awe of Pay than any other English raider; the chronicler of the exploits of Don Pero Ni&ntilde;o describes his master's expedition in the channel in 1406, when he raided English coastal towns. They were particularly keen to attack Poole because it was known to be the base of the fearsome Arripay who had carried off the crucifix from St Mary of Finist&egrave;re. The Castilians landed outside the walls of Poole and managed to get into the town, burning much property including a warehouse full of naval stores. Pay's brother was killed in the confused fighting, but Pay himself was not there. In 1404 the king had commissioned him to go to sea to &#145;provide for the destruction of the king's enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1401&#150;5</i>, 457). In 1405 he was with Lord Berkeley off Milford Haven operating against a French squadron which was supporting Owain Glyn D&#373;r's rebellion. They managed to take fifteen French vessels including that taking the seneschal of France to Wales. In 1406 Pay was again in the channel, this time with the ships of the Cinque Ports, and took a large number of French ships suspected of trying to get supplies to the Welsh. In view of the ambiguous attitude of the crown to these actions in the channel at this date it is not surprising that Pay seems to have ended his career with an appointment as water bailiff of Calais with a royal pension. He died at Faversham, Kent, on 25 March 1419 and was buried in the north transept of St Mary of Charity, Faversham.<br>
