<span class="headword">Tate,  Zouch</span>  (1606&#150;1650), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in March 1606 at Delapre, Northamptonshire, the eldest son of Sir William Tate (<i>b</i>. before 1560, <i>d</i>. 1617) and his wife, Elizabeth Zouch (<i>d</i>. 1617), daughter of Edward, eleventh Baron Zouche of Harringworth, Northamptonshire, president of the council in the marches of Wales, warden of the Cinque Ports, and a director of the Virginia Company. Like his father and uncle, the antiquary Francis Tate, he studied at Oxford, matriculating from Trinity College in 1621, and like them entered the Middle Temple, in 1625; in 1623 he had studied French during a tour of France. Like his father, and his grandfather Bartholomew Tate, he served as justice of the peace in Northamptonshire. In addition to the family estate at Delapre, just south of Northampton, granted to his grandfather in 1590 by Elizabeth I and valued at &pound;1500 per annum, he owned several other properties including two manors in Northamptonshire and one in Warwickshire, and was coheir to three manors in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Tate was elected MP for Northampton in April 1640 and in November 1640, again emulating his father (MP for the county in 1614, and for Corfe Castle in 1593) and uncle Francis (MP in 1601). With the outbreak of civil war he appears to have been among those parliamentarians more committed to pursuing military victory against the king, and supported the creation of the Anglo-Scottish executive committee of both kingdoms in 1644. In March 1644 he favoured the appointment of the earl of Manchester as lieutenant-general and Lord Robartes as field marshal, and that same year chaired a committee concerned with the composition of parliament's principal field army, under the earl of Essex. By November his committee had been allocated the unenviable task of investigating the charges and counter-charges of misconduct between the earl of Manchester, general of the eastern association, and Oliver Cromwell, his lieutenant-general. As the Commons braced itself to debate the issue on 9 December, however, Tate opened with a speech which sought to avoid laying blame, asserted that the &#145;chief causes of our division are pride and covetousness&#146;  (Kaplan, 87), and urged that quarrels be sunk in a general ban on the wartime holding of offices in parliament's gift by members of either house. Appealing to his colleagues' sense of the righteousness of a cause greater than factional differences, his call was generally welcomed and soon embodied in the self-denying ordinance. The measure coincided with the reorganization of parliament's armies associated with the birth of the New Model Army, and Tate's committee took on the assessment of officers for the new force.<br>
<br>While serving as a peacemaker for political and military unity, however, Tate held divisive views on religion. A lay member of the Westminster assembly, at some point he joined its grand committee, and was recognized by the Scottish minister Robert Baillie as one of the more inflexible supporters of strict presbyterian settlement for the Church of England. He vigorously opposed an October 1644 proposal by Henry Vane the younger and Oliver St John to extend toleration to Independents and co-operated with Baillie in 1646 in an unsuccessful bid to block the imposition of lay commissioners upon the English church, a move which Baillie and his allies saw as a dilution of plans for a full presbyterian system. In early 1647 he supported efforts to promote conformity to the planned national church, not least within the parliamentary armies, and on 7 April 1647 was appointed to the Derby House committee, effectively a parliamentarian executive, dominated by political presbyterians, and set for collision with the New Model Army. Tate's presbyterian intolerance, combined with his vocal opposition to the army's &#145;remonstrance&#146; of November 1648 made him an obvious candidate for exclusion from the Long Parliament at Pride's Purge in December 1648.<br>
<br>Tate had married Catherine (<i>c</i>.1607&#150;1700), daughter of Sir Giles Allington of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire, and granddaughter of Thomas Cecil, earl of Exeter, making him a relative by marriage of the MPs Sir Robert Crane and Sir Thomas Fanshawe. The Tates had three sons: William (<i>d</i>. 1695), heir to Delapre, who married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1699), daughter of James Stedman, MP for Chippenham, in 1656; Sir John Tate (<i>d</i>. 1692), who became recorder of London; and Zouch (<i>d</i>. 1683), a soldier who died defending Tangier. The Tates' daughters were Elizabeth, and Catherine who married John Carew of Somerset. Zouch Tate died in December 1650 and was buried at Hardingstone church, near Delapre, beside his parents.<br>
