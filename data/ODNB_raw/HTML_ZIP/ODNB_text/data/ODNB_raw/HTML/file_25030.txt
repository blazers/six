<span class="headword">Seffrid (II)</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1204), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, is of unknown origins but, given the unusual name, is likely to have been related to Seffrid (I), bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. Indeed while Seffrid (II) was bishop a nephew, also called Seffrid, became successively canon, treasurer, and dean of Chichester Cathedral, predeceasing his uncle. A Seffrid, possibly Seffrid (II) in his youth, witnessed a charter of Hilary, bishop of Chichester, shortly before 1157. Seffrid (II) studied law at Bologna, the greatest international centre of legal learning in his time, if, as is probable, he is the &#145;Seffrid the Englishman&#146; whose mother Matilda was commemorated with an annual <i>obit</i>, according to a twelfth-century necrology of St Saviour, Bologna, a hostel specially favoured by English scholars. Later, Pope Celestine III referred to Godfrey de Lucy, bishop of Winchester, and Seffrid (II) as &#145;wise in the law&#146; (<i>iuri sapientes</i>).<br>
<br>Seffrid first appears in English sources in 1172&#150;3 when, as Master Seffrid (the title indicating an extended period of study at a major centre of learning), he became at once both a royal itinerant justice, as recorded in the pipe roll, and also archdeacon of Chichester. He obtained at about this time the rectorship of Westminster Abbey's church at Bloxham in Oxfordshire, which seems to have been reserved for men with good royal connections. He thus provides an example of the expanding opportunities of the time in ecclesiastical and secular administration for Englishmen who had studied abroad, and of the growing tendency to combine posts in both administrations, to which the distinguished canonist Pope Alexander III objected in 1179. It is possible that Seffrid took this objection to heart, for in his few years as dean of Chichester (1176/1178&#150;1180), and in his near quarter-century (from 1180 until his death) as bishop, there is no evidence of his taking any part in royal administration, nor of his playing any but the purely formal role expected of a bishop in politics (for example, attendance at royal coronations, or acting in a minor way as peacemaker between the archbishops and monks of Canterbury). Rather the bishop appears from his charters as an assiduous diocesan, ensuring where possible endowments of vicarages for the material support of priests resident in parish churches, arranging alms for hospitals, regulating the prebendal system of his cathedral, and, not least, throwing himself into its building works. The cathedral suffered a fire in 1187, but was rebuilt and rededicated by Seffrid in 1199, and he also built the hall and chapel of the bishop's palace at Chichester and engaged in work on the episcopal castle at Amberley and the church of St Andrew on his manor of Bishopstone, both in Sussex. He died on 17 March 1204.<br>
