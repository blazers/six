<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  William</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">judge in New Zealand</span>, the son of Henry Martin, a manufacturer, and his wife, Mary, was born in Birmingham and baptized there on 22 May 1807. He attended King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham, and in 1825 matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, whence in 1829 he graduated as twenty-sixth wrangler and fourth classic and took the second chancellor's medal. In 1831 he was elected fellow of his college and in 1832 proceeded MA and was admitted at Lincoln's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1836. Having resigned his fellowship in 1838 he went to London to practise law.<br>
<br>At college Martin had been a close friend of George Augustus Selwyn, who was to become the first bishop of New Zealand, and at Selwyn's prompting he accepted the office of chief justice of New Zealand in January 1841. On 3 April 1841 he married <a href="#cosubject_65482">Mary Ann Parker [<i>see below</i>]</a> at St Ethelburga, Bishopsgate, London, where her father was rector; however, Martin sailed alone for New Zealand only three days later.<br>
<br>In New Zealand, Martin's first task was to impress on the Maori their rights and responsibilities under British law, to which they were subject after the treaty of Waitangi. This he managed more effectively than he did his second task, the setting up of a system of courts and procedures for the new colony. His ideas for these closely followed British practice and were over-complex for a young colony.<br>
<br>Martin worked closely with Selwyn in setting up schools and establishing a scheme for church administration. He and Selwyn consistently defended the rights of the Maori, particularly in 1847 when they protested against certain clauses in the proposed new constitution which they felt broke faith with the Maori.<br>
<br>Always in poor health, Martin returned with his wife to England in August 1855 on leave. He spent the winter of 1856&#150;7 in Italy and in 1857 resigned his post. That same year an honorary DCL was conferred on him by the University of Oxford and the New Zealand government granted him a pension. In 1860 he was knighted.<br>
<br>In 1859 the Martins returned to New Zealand and settled in Auckland. Martin's poor health prevented his accepting a seat in 1860 on the new council for native affairs, but his interest in the Maori continued and he did his utmost to prevent war with the Maori in the 1860s. His pamphlet <span class="italic">The Taranaki question</span> (1860) defended the stand taken by Wiremu Kingi Te Rangitake at Waitara, and later works argued for a respect for the Maori based on the principles of the treaty of Waitangi. Martin protested against the <span class="roman">Native Lands Act</span> of 1865 and in 1871 helped to draft amendments to it.<br>
<br>In 1874 the Martins left New Zealand for the last time. They went first to Lichfield to live in the bishop's palace, where Selwyn was bishop, and later moved to Torquay. An able linguist, who knew Hebrew, Arabic, and Melanesian and Polynesian dialects, Martin published <span class="italic">Inquiries Concerning the Structure of the Semitic Languages</span> (2 vols., 1876&#150;8). He died at Matlock Terrace, Torquay, on 18 November 1880.<br>
<br>Martin was praised for his ability and integrity even by those who disagreed with his views. Those views and his works all sprang from his deep Christian faith.<br>
<br>Martin's wife, <a name="cosubject_65482"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ann Martin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Parker]</span></span>, Lady Martin  (1817&#150;1884), <span class="occ">mission worker</span>, shared this faith. She was born in London on 5 July 1817, the daughter of William Parker, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Ann. Her sister married John Meadows Rodwell, the oriental scholar and her father's successor at Bishopsgate. Although she was an invalid throughout her life, this did not stop her acquiring a good education, being cheerful and enterprising, marrying Martin, and joining him in New Zealand in 1842, the year after his arrival there. She settled at Taurarua (Judges Bay, Auckland) and busied herself in setting up a hospital for the Maori, running classes for them and for Europeans, and with religious work. With Sarah Selwyn and Caroline Abraham, she was known as one of the &#145;three graces&#146; who followed George Selwyn. She was convinced of the need to enlighten the Maori, but treated them with deep respect, regard, and liking, and was privately very critical of European ignorance of their customs. Having returned to England with her husband in 1874 she died on 2 January 1884 at Waldon Hill House, Torquay. Her experiences are described in her book <span class="italic">Our Maoris</span> (1884).<br>
