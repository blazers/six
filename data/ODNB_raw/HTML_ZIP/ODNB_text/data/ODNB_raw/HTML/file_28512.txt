<span class="headword">Walker,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was baptized on 5 June 1698 at St Anne's, Soho, London, the son of Francis Walker and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated locally at Mr Midon's school. In 1714 he joined Shepherd's company to play Paris in the droll <span class="italic">The Siege of Troy</span>. Barton Booth then recruited him for the Drury Lane company, where he first appeared on 2 June 1715 as the third whore in Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">The City Ramble</span>. During his first season he was given more sizeable roles, as Young Fashion in Sir John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, Captain Jolly in Johnson's <span class="italic">The Cobbler of Preston</span>, and King in Dryden and Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Duke of Guise</span>, as well as a solo benefit. Walker stayed with the company, playing Granius in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Caius Marius</span>, Hilliard in Richard Brome's <span class="italic">A Jovial Crew</span>, Pisander in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">The Bondman</span>, Cornwall and Edmund in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Sir Charles in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Fair Quaker of Deal</span>, and originating Cardono in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Cruel Gift</span> and Charles in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Non-Juror</span>. His engagement appears to have been uninterrupted by his indictment, according to the <span class="italic">Evening Post</span> of 4&#150;7 May 1717, for the murder of an abbot and a bailiff near the playhouse. Davies reports he was acquitted, and nothing further seems to have transpired.<br>
<br>Like many Drury Lane comedians, Walker did not abandon the summer fairs. He excelled in drolls, those short, comic sketches that were often cobbled-together excerpts from popular plays. In September 1720 he collaborated with a booth owner called Lee on <span class="italic">The Siege of Bethulia</span>, a Southwark fair droll, and the following year he worked Lee's booth at both Bartholomew fair and Southwark fair, appearing in the droll <span class="italic">The Noble Englishman</span>. By 1722 Walker was running his own great booth in Bird Cage Alley at Southwark fair, where he produced two drolls, <span class="italic">The Royal Revenge</span> and <span class="italic">Valentine and Orson</span>, with actors from Drury Lane. This popular entertainment required a performer with a strong voice, able to establish an easy rapport with an audience. Walker offered these qualities in abundance; indeed, Hill, in <span class="italic">The Actor</span>, thought that on occasion &#145;the vehemence of his feeling took away his utterance&#146;  (Hill, 82).<br>
<br>In 1721 Walker was poached by John Rich for the company at Lincoln's Inn Fields where, during the 1720s, he earned &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. daily, with modest annual benefits, which may have netted him &pound;20. Davies thought Walker an inheritor of Barton Booth's roles and his easy, natural manner, and particularly praised his Faulconbridge in <span class="italic">King John</span> for his &#145;manly deportment, vigorous action, and a humour which descended to an easy familiarity in conveying a jest or sarcasm with uncommon poignancy&#146;  (Davies, 1.15). Walker's expanded range of roles with Rich included noble, if compromised, heroes, such as the eponymous roles in Dryden's <span class="italic">Don Sebastian</span> and Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, Alexander in Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> and Massinissa in his <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, Ulysses in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>, and Juba in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span>. He had the comic timing for such roles as Young Valere in Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Gamester</span>, Harcourt in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, Lovemore in Thomas Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span>, and Dick in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Confederacy</span>, as well as the stage presence to carry such sexually threatening parts as Lorenzo in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span> and Polydore in Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. Although not originally designed for him, but rather for James Quin, who refused the role, Macheath in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> was the kind of role Walker excelled in, and it was the part that made him, despite his limited singing experience. The play had an extended run, and Walker is captured in the role of Macheath in Hogarth's painting of the prison scene.<br>
<br>Walker's extracurricular activities during this period stretched to playwriting. On 31 July 1724 his compression of Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Massaniello</span> was printed, and he took the title role at Lincoln's Inn Fields that season. In the September after his success in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> he produced an imitation called <span class="italic">The Quaker's Opera</span> at Southwark fair, which made it indoors to the Haymarket in October 1728. Two years later he tried out <span class="italic">The Fate of Villainy</span> at Goodman's Fields Theatre, but it quickly disappeared; however, when rewritten as <span class="italic">Love and Loyalty</span>, it was well received at its one and only performance in Dublin in 1744. Walker also returned to his source of summer income when in September 1732 he and Rayner produced Centlivre's afterpiece <span class="italic">A Wife Well Managed</span> and <span class="italic">The Humours of Harlequin</span> at a Tottenham Court booth. This seems to have been his last sortie into the London fairs. He stayed with Rich's company when it moved to the new Covent Garden Theatre in 1732, accepting a reduced daily rate of 16<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. During the next few years he added more demanding roles to his repertory, such as Bajazet in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Angelo in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Sempronius in <span class="italic">Cato</span>, Kite in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, Faulconbridge in <span class="italic">King John</span>, and Fainall in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>.<br>
<br>Walker's life appears to have been beset by debt, and by the late 1730s his problems were compounded by the death of his wife, Mary, on 20 March 1737. She was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, three days later. By 1739 Walker's employment was patchy, and he made only two benefit appearances at Drury Lane that year. The following season, 1741&#150;2, he moved to the company at Goodman's Fields Theatre, which had staged his <span class="italic">Fate of Villainy</span>, and he was made much use of by Henry Giffard, but managed only one benefit performance in 1742. During the summer of 1742 he went to the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, and had occasional roles at Aungier Street, where he managed to persuade the management to mount his redrafted play <span class="italic">Love and Loyalty</span>. However, despite receiving critical applause, Walker could not cover the house charges for a second night, and the play closed. Chetwood thought &#145;this Disappointment hasten'd his Death&#146;  (Chetwood, 248), for Walker died a few days later, on 5 June 1744.<br>
