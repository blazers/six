<span class="headword">Lumley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cornwallis]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Viscountess Lumley of Waterford  (<em>c.</em>1578&#150;1658), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was the second daughter of Sir William Cornwallis of Brome, Suffolk (<i>c</i>.1549&#150;1611), and his first wife, Lucy (<i>c</i>.1549&#150;1608), daughter and coheir of John Neville, fourth Baron Latimer, and his wife, Lucy. Her father's profligacy at court lost &pound;20,000; he left debts amounting to &pound;4000, to settle which five manors had to be sold. He even allegedly remarked: &#145;So that I may be about her Majesty, I care not to be groom of the scullery&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 1.659). On 22 November 1596 at her father's house in St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, she married Sir William Sandys (<i>d</i>. 1629) of Mottisfont, Hampshire, son and heir of Sir Walter Sandys and a grandson of Thomas, Lord Sandys of the Vyne. On 11 May 1630 at St Bride's, London, she married <a href="#cosubject_17181">Richard Lumley, Viscount Lumley of Waterford [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lumley's second marriage was unhappy as conflict grew over her husband's aid in clearing her debts to the earl of Danby. He petitioned the king on 30 March 1640, complaining of his great costs, and that owing to the differences between him and his wife just satisfaction was denied him. On 18 May 1640 a day was appointed for the House of Lords to hear their differences. Elizabeth's breach with her husband appears to have been unresolved as their wills failed to address each other as husband and wife. Elizabeth's will lamented &#145;these long miseries of scarcity&#146; and that her personal effects were &#145;soe poor through my long continued sufferings as I may well shame to have anie eyes upon them&#146;  (will, PROB 11/293, sig. 356). She left &pound;2000 towards a marriage portion for her niece, Henrietta Maria Cornwallis. She was &#145;strong minded, independent and thoughtful&#146;  (Jordan, <span class="italic">Charities of Rural England</span>, 279), and warned the viscount to &#145;interrupt not nor meddle with anie thing in my possession&#146;  (will, PROB 11/293, sig. 356).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lumley's greatest significance rests in her foundation of almshouses and schools in the North Riding of Yorkshire and London, which reached the substantial total of &pound;5750. They included almshouses in St Botolph Aldgate, London, and Thornton-le-Dale, the Yorkshire parish in which she usually resided. Her concern for education was such that she also founded grammar schools in Thornton-le-Dale and Pickering, and left an endowment of &pound;40 per annum to support scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge for inhabitants of her three local Yorkshire parishes. She died childless and was buried on 2 February 1658 in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Her second husband, <a name="cosubject_17181"></a><span class="headword">Richard Lumley</span>, first Viscount Lumley of Waterford  (<em>bap. </em>1589, <em>d.</em> 1661<span class="mult">x</span>3)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized at Chester-le-Street, co. Durham, on 7 April 1589, the son and heir of Roger Lumley and his wife, Anne Kurtwich. Educated at Cambridge, he was awarded the degree of MA in 1609, in which year he also succeeded to the estates of his cousin, John, Baron Lumley. On 17 August 1614 he married his first wife, Frances (1592&#150;1627), widow of William Holland of Chichester, Sussex, and daughter of Henry Shelley of Warminghurst, Sussex.<br>
<br>Lumley was admitted to Gray's Inn on 2 March 1615, knighted at Theobald's on 19 July 1616, and created Viscount Lumley of Waterford in the peerage of Ireland on 12 July 1628. He had been living on his Sussex estates, but was ordered to return to Lumley Castle, co. Durham, on 27 January 1638. He was a commissioner for the duchy of Cornwall in 1641. He garrisoned Lumley Castle for the royalists during the civil war and was president of Prince Rupert's council of war at the surrender of Bristol in 1645. He petitioned that he left Stansted in January 1644 to join the king, but never bore arms nor contributed to the royalist service. He took the national covenant and the negative oath, and his composition fine was later reduced to &pound;1925 15<i>s</i>. In 1646 he petitioned against local people felling wood on his Stansted estate. In 1654 he was granted a pass to travel abroad. Before the meeting of the Convention Parliament in 1660 he signed a declaration of moderate royalists pledging not to take revenge upon old enemies. His will, dated 13 April 1661, was proved on 12 March 1663. He was buried in the vault at Cheam parish church, Surrey. His son John had died in 1658, and he was succeeded as second viscount by his grandson, Richard Lumley, later first earl of Scarbrough.<br>
