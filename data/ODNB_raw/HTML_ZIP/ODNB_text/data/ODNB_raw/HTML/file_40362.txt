<span class="headword">Schotz,  Benno</span>  (1891&#150;1984), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 28 August 1891 at Arensberg (Kuressaare), on the island of Oesel (Saare), Estonia, the youngest of the four sons and two daughters of Jacob Schotz (<i>d</i>. 1920), watchmaker, and his wife, Cherna Tischa Abramovitch (<i>d</i>. 1917). His parents were Jewish. At the age of two he moved to P&auml;rnu on the mainland and attended the <i>Gymnasium</i> there until 1911. He then studied at the Grossherzogliche Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany (1911&#150;12), and from 1912 to 1914 at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, where he gained a diploma in engineering. He settled in Glasgow and in 1930 became a naturalized British citizen. From 1914 to 1923 he worked in the drawing-office of Messrs John Brown, shipbuilders, Clydebank, while attending evening classes in sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art from 1914 to 1917. Although without a formal art qualification, he took a studio in the city centre and began his long association with the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1917, exhibiting more than 100 works altogether and being elected honorary president in 1973. At the same time he formed an association with the Royal Scottish Academy, showing more than 200 works and becoming an associate in 1933 and an academician in 1937. He also contributed to shows at the Leicester Galleries, London, from 1921 and the Royal Academy from 1925, exhibiting at the latter twenty-nine works. In 1919 he was a founder member of, and in 1921 president of, the short-lived Society of Painters and Sculptors in Glasgow.<br>
<br>Encouraged by the architect John Keppie, Schotz became a full-time sculptor. His first solo Glasgow exhibition was at Reid's Gallery in 1926 and his first in London at Alex Reid and Lefevre Ltd (Lefevre Gallery) in 1930. He married Milly Stelmach (1902&#150;1971), a dressmaker, on 4 January 1927; they had two children, Cherna Schotz (<i>b</i>. 1930) and Amiel Moshe Schotz (<i>b</i>. 1936). On the death of Archibald Dawson in 1938, Schotz took up the post of head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art, which he held until his retirement in 1961. An enthusiastic teacher, it surprised him years later to learn that students would tremble when he entered a class  (<span class="italic">Bronze in my Blood</span>, 219). A lively host to many artists, writers, actors, and politicians in his homes at 207 West Campbell Street (from 1932) and 2 Kirklee Road (from 1950), he also assisted refugees from eastern Europe, including the painters Jankel Adler and Josef Herman. An ardent Zionist, he began to see the new state of Israel as his true home. His connections led to a solo exhibition in 1955 at the Bezalel National Art Museum, Jerusalem, and the Municipal Museum of Modern Art, Haifa.<br>
<br>Schotz's immense output runs to several hundred portraits and compositions. His bronzes were produced in editions of up to ten. The largest public collections of his work are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, which has fourteen works, including <span class="italic">Lord Boyd Orr</span> (bronze, 1950), <span class="italic">James Bridie</span> (terracotta, 1953), and <span class="italic">Stanley Baxter</span> (plaster, 1983); and the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum, which has twelve works, including <span class="italic">John Keppie</span> (bronze, 1922), <span class="italic">The Exile&#151;Ura Collins</span> (mahogany, 1926), <span class="italic">Alexander Reid</span> (bronze, 1927), <span class="italic">Milly</span> (terracotta, 1953), and <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (terracotta, 1953). A typically appealing portrait of a child is that of his daughter Cherna (bronze, 1932, formerly Dundee Art Galleries and Museums, now McManus Galleries, Dundee). He considered <span class="italic">Hugh McDiarmid</span> (1958, bronzes in Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and BBC Scotland) to be &#145;the high water mark of my portraiture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bronze in my Blood</span>, 173). His group of Israeli leaders includes <span class="italic">David Ben-Gurion</span> (bronze, 1963, Israel Museum, Jerusalem) and <span class="italic">Golda Meir</span> (bronze, 1970, Israeli embassy, London). Notable large compositions are <span class="italic">Painting and Sculpture</span> (sandstone relief, 1928&#150;9, Mercat building, Glasgow Cross, Glasgow; for John Keppie), <span class="italic">Moses the Sculptor</span> (sandstone, 1949, priv. coll.), and the altar cross (iron, welded bronze, and plastic metal, 1958) in St Paul's Roman Catholic Church, Glenrothes, Fife.<br>
<br>Schotz was one of the most important Scottish twentieth-century sculptors, spanning the period between Pittendrigh Macgillivray and Sir Eduardo Paolozzi. Principally a modeller renowned for his portraiture, he took his inspiration from Donatello and Rodin and was a spiritual brother of Jacob Epstein, though he resisted the title of &#145;the Scottish Epstein&#146;. His vigorous, sometimes craggy heads betray the directness and speed with which they were modelled, a slight exaggeration of features and variation in expression adding movement and life. His carvings in wood and stone have a more stylized, even geometric character. He was generally a traditionalist but about 1960 moved towards abstraction, introducing modern techniques and materials such as welding, plastic metal, and cement. Tree trunks, stone, and shells became the inspiration for expressionistic figures or pure abstracts, developed through countless pen-and-ink drawings.<br>
<br>With prominent cheekbones, alert eyes, a receding brow, and a thick mop of swept-back hair, Schotz would emphasize his bohemian air by sporting a bow-tie. He expressed his opinions in a forthright manner in an accent which recalled his eastern European roots. On 16 April 1963 he was created her majesty the queen's sculptor-in-ordinary for Scotland, as successor to Sir William Reid Dick. A corresponding member of the National Sculpture Society of New York in 1956, he received the honorary degree of LLD from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, in 1969 and the freedom of the city of Glasgow in 1981. He died of old age at his home, 2 Kirklee Road, Glasgow, on 11 October 1984 and was buried on 19 October in Jerusalem.<br>
