<span class="headword">Ayrton,  Edmund</span>  (1734&#150;1808), <span class="occ">composer and musician</span>, was born on 21 October 1734 at Ripon, Yorkshire, the third of the four surviving children of Edward Ayrton (1698&#150;1774), alderman and later mayor and magistrate of the borough of Ripon, and his wife, Catherine (1701?&#150;1781), daughter of John Clough of Thirsk in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Educated at the free grammar school in Ripon, Ayrton &#145;was a contemporary of Beilby Porteus, afterwards Bishop of London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Harmonicon</span>, 142), though F&eacute;tis suggests that he spent only five years at this establishment  (F&eacute;tis, 1.177). His son William wrote that Ayrton was &#145;intended for the church &hellip; but his father, finding it prudent to indulge his son's natural inclination for music, placed him under the instruction of Dr [James] Nares, then organist of the cathedral of York&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Harmonicon</span>, 142), and it seems likely that this took place in 1744, Ayrton becoming a chorister and presumably also studying the organ. In 1755 he succeeded Samuel Wise as <i>rector chori</i> of the collegiate church of Southwell in Nottinghamshire&#151;an establishment with an organ built by Bernard &#145;Father&#146; Smith&#151;where his duties included the posts of organist, auditor, and &#145;singingman&#146; (possibly denominating the master of the choristers). On 22 April 1756 he went to London for three further months' instruction from Nares, whose appointment to the Chapel Royal had taken place only three months earlier. During his time at Southwell, Ayrton also taught music, and it was to a pupil, the &#145;only moderately well educated&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 52349, fol. 97) Ann Clay (1739&#150;1800), that he was married in Southwell on 20 September 1762. On 1 January 1764 Ayrton left Southwell on being appointed a gentleman of the chapels royal in place of John Busswell, shortly after which he was installed as vicar-choral of St Paul's Cathedral (23 December 1767). He applied unsuccessfully for the post of organist at St Alban's Church, Wood Street, in April 1766, but joined the Royal Society of Musicians in June 1765 and became a freemason in the Somerset House lodge in January 1779. On 1 February 1772 he became a lay clerk at Westminster Abbey, and in 1780 master of the choristers of the Chapel Royal replacing James Nares, who, according to John Stafford Smith, Ayrton's successor as master of the boys, &#145;gave up the Membership of the boys to him&#146;  (ibid., fol. 7) after hearing his anthem &#145;Thy rightousness&#146; (1778). This post also seems to have included a sinecure described as &#145;the post of Lutinist&#146;  (Baldwin, 246, 370&#150;71).<br>
<br>By 1779 Ayrton was apparently also recruiting singers for Covent Garden; R. J. S. Stevens noted his participation in a type of choral audition at the Tilt Yard Coffee House in the presence of Antonio Sacchini, Johann Christian Bach, and Johann Christian Fischer at which Ayrton, as well as assembling the group, played the harpsichord. He was an assistant director at the first Handel commemoration in 1784, and at the commemorations in several subsequent years. On 29 April 1784 he was admitted to the degree of MusD at Trinity College, Cambridge. The anthem composed for the degree was dedicated to the honorary president and vice-presidents of the Royal Society of Musicians, and the published version contains an extensive list of subscribers. It was performed at St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July 1784 at the thanksgiving service held at the close of the War of American Independence. Ayrton is also said to have been admitted to the degree of &#145;Mus. Doc. Oxon, ad eundem 1788&#146;, but in the absence of any record, this ascription cannot be verified despite appearing on the title-pages of a number of his works.<br>
<br>Ayrton was the father of fourteen children, all from his marriage; six survived his death, the most famous of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/950/', "William Ayrton (1777&#150;1858)")</script>. Edmund Edward (1765&#150;1811), the eldest son, was also a musician, noted by Doane as a tenor and organist living in Swansea in 1790. Benjamin (<i>b</i>. 1778, <i>d</i>. after 1808) became a doctor and went to sea on a South American merchant ship, marrying in Buenos Aires, where he died shortly afterwards, while Scrope Ayrton, the youngest son (1781&#150;1811), was second in command of the brig <i>Bouncer</i> and died in combat at Verdun. The W. Ayrton listed by Burney and Doane was probably Ayrton's nephew William Francis Morrel (1778&#150;1850); the Morrel Ayrton (<i>fl</i>. 1790&#150;1794) listed by Doane, while living at the same address as Edmund Ayrton, was almost certainly a great-nephew rather than a son, and is probably also identifiable with the &#145;Mr Ayrton, jun.&#146; listed by Burney.<br>
<br>Ayrton's wife, Ann, died on 14 May 1800; however, he retained the post of master of children until his resignation, probably due to ill health, in 1805, despite an unpleasant episode in 1800 in which he was accused of starving the boys. Ayrton himself died on 22 May 1808, probably of tuberculosis, in the home that he had occupied at least since 1785, 24 James Street, Buckingham Gate, Westminster; it had the reputation of being haunted, allowing him to occupy it at a low rent. He was buried on 28 May 1808 in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey, near the graves of his wife and five of his children. On his death his estate was valued at &pound;1470 before the sale of his household contents, which included an Amati violin dated 1641 and a violoncello by Duke and raised a further &pound;215. Further instruments, including a family organ and harpsichords by Baker Harris and Tabel, were bequests to family members in his will, and a number of valuable manuscripts&#151;including items by Hasse, Haydn, Porpora, Scarlatti, and Stradella&#151;were later sold by Puttick and Simpson following the death of his son William. Portraits of Ayrton by John Hoppner and William Pether were also bequeathed.<br>
<br>Ayrton was mostly well respected among his colleagues&#151;being, for example, a signatory to J. W. Callcott's doctoral certificate in 1800 and enthusiastically thanked by Archdeacon Robert Nares in the preface to the posthumous publication of his father's anthems in 1788&#151;but Samuel Wesley described him as &#145;one of the most egregious blockheads under the sun&#146;  (Lightwood, 180). His extant compositions, the manuscripts of which are held by the British Library, are in the English ecclesiastical tradition following Maurice Greene, with strong Handelian influences, and include two complete morning and evening services in C and E[flat], several anthems, and a number of chants and glees of lesser significance. His sister was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7026/', "Nicholas Thomas Dall")</script>, the Danish painter, and his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21267/', "John Ayrton Paris")</script> was president of the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
