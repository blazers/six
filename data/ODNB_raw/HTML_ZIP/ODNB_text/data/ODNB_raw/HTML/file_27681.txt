<span class="headword">Tregelles,  Samuel Prideaux</span>  (1813&#150;1875), <span class="occ">biblical scholar</span>, son of Samuel Tregelles (1789&#150;1828), merchant, of Falmouth, and his wife, Dorothy (1790&#150;1873), daughter of George Prideaux of Kingsbridge, was born at Wodehouse Place, Falmouth, on 30 January 1813. He was the nephew of Edwin Octavius Tregelles. He was educated at Falmouth classical school from 1825 to 1828 and showed early promise. From 1829 to 1835 he was employed at the Neath Abbey ironworks in Glamorgan, and he devoted his spare time to learning Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. He also mastered Welsh, and sometimes preached and published in that language. Finding his work uncongenial he returned to Falmouth in 1835, and supported himself by taking pupils. Although both his parents were Quakers he joined the Plymouth Brethren, but later in life he became a Presbyterian. On 12 March 1839 he married his cousin, Sarah Anna (1807&#150;1882), eldest daughter of Walter Prideaux, banker, of Plymouth. They had no children.<br>
<br>Tregelles's first book was <span class="italic">Passages in the Revelation Connected with the Old Testament</span> (1836). In 1837, having obtained work from publishers, he settled in London. He superintended the publication of the <span class="italic">Englishman's Greek Concordance to the New Testament</span> (1839) and the <span class="italic">Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament</span> (1843). In 1841 he wrote &#145;An historical account of the English translations of the scriptures&#146; for Samuel Bagster's <span class="italic">English Hexapla</span>.<br>
<br>In 1838 Tregelles took up the critical study of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and decided to publish a new version of the Greek text. This plan resulted from his discovery that the <i>textus receptus</i> did not rest on ancient authority and that existing collations were inconsistent and inaccurate. He aimed to produce a text based entirely on ancient manuscripts compared with early versions and patristic citations to the time of Eusebius, and to state clearly the authorities for the readings. Tregelles was for many years unaware that he was working on the same lines as the German philologist and textual critic, Karl Lachmann. Like Lachmann he minimized the importance of cursive manuscripts, dating from the ninth century onwards, thereby differing from his fellow critic F. H. A. Scrivener.<br>
<br>Tregelles first became generally known through his <span class="italic">Book of Revelation in Greek Edited from Ancient Authorities</span> (1844). This contained the announcement of his intention to prepare a Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. He began by collating the <span class="roman">Codex Augiensis</span> (F 010) at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1845 he went to Rome with the intention of collating codex B 03 in the Vatican, but, though he spent five months there, he was not allowed to copy the manuscript. He nevertheless managed to note some important readings. From Rome he went to Florence, Modena, Venice, Munich, and Basel, reading and collating all relevant manuscripts. He returned to England in November 1846 and settled at Plymouth, and he continued collating manuscripts in the British Museum. In 1849 he went to Paris, but an attack of cholera drove him home. He returned in 1850, finished the laborious task of collating the damaged &#145;Cyprius&#146; (K 017), and then collated other manuscripts including the minuscule no. 33, &#145;Queen of the cursives&#146;. Tregelles subsequently went to Hamburg, and from there travelled to Berlin, where he met Lachmann. He also visited Leipzig, where he collaborated with Constantin Tischendorf, Dresden, Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and Utrecht, and he returned home in 1851. Until 1857 he was employed collating manuscripts in England. In 1853 he restored and deciphered the uncial palimpsest Z 035 of <span class="roman">Matthew's gospel</span> at Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1854 Tregelles published <span class="italic">An Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament</span>. In 1856 he rewrote for T. H. Horne's <span class="italic">Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</span> the section on textual criticism in volume 4, and in 1860 he contributed a postscript, &#145;Additions&#146;. These publications provide details about the principles on which his subsequent textual work was based.<br>
<br>The first part of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, <span class="roman">St Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">St Mark</span>, was published to subscribers in 1857, but proved unremunerative. Tregelles went abroad for his health, and stayed at Geneva and Milan. At Milan he made a facsimile tracing of the Muratorian fragment (<span class="roman">Codex Muratorianus</span>), but he was unable to publish it until 1867. On the return journey he visited Christian Bunsen at Heidelberg. In 1860 he went on a tour through Spain, where he showed much interest in the protestant community. The second part of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>&#151;<span class="roman">St Luke</span> and <span class="roman">St John</span>&#151;appeared in 1861. In 1862 Tregelles went to Leipzig to examine the <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span>, then in Tischendorf's keeping, and from there he travelled to Halle and Erlangen. Tregelles's editions of <span class="roman">Acts</span> and the catholic epistles were issued in 1865 (by which date Tischendorf's facsimile of <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> was available), and the <span class="roman">Pauline epistles</span> up to <span class="roman">2 Thessalonians</span> were published in 1869. He was revising the last chapters of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> in 1870 when he had a stroke of paralysis, after which he never walked. He continued to work in bed. The remainder of the epistles were published in 1870, but the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> (the text of which differs about 230 places from that which he published in 1844) was edited from his papers by S. J. B. Bloxsidge and B. W. Newton in 1872. It lacked the long-expected prolegomena, but in 1879 F. J. A. Hort published an appendix containing the materials for the prolegomena that Tregelles's notes supplied, with additions (especially readings from <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> and <span class="roman">Codex Vaticanus</span> in the gospels) and corrections by A. W. Streane. Tregelles's collations and his edition of a Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> based on the oldest manuscripts available were remarkable achievements and they paved the way for the Greek edition of Westcott and Hort in 1881 and for the Revised Version of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> of the same year.<br>
<br>Tregelles received the degree of LLD from St Andrews in 1850, and in 1862 he was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100, which was doubled in 1870. He was a member of the New Testament Revision Company but was unable to attend its meetings. He died at his home, 6 Portland Square, Plymouth, on 24 April 1875, and was buried five days later in Plymouth cemetery. His wife survived him until 1882, receiving half of his civil-list pension. Among Tregelles's other works, his <span class="italic">Collation of the texts of Griesbach, Scholz, Lachmann, and Tischendorf, with that in common use</span> (1854) and his <span class="italic">Codex Zacynthius, Fragments of St Luke</span> (1861) have proved to be of enduring value.<br>
