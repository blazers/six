<span class="headword">Brian fitz Count</span>  (<em>c.</em>1090&#150;<em>c.</em>1149), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Alan (IV) Fergant, duke of Brittany.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandmarriage"></a>Background and marriage</h2>Brian was most likely illegitimate, for his mother's name is not recorded, and he is not known to have held any land by inheritance. He became a great landowner under Henry I, and one of his most intimate counsellors. In the early 1140s, when embroiled in the civil war of Stephen's reign, he would look back to &#145;the good and golden days&#146; of Henry I, describing himself as a man &#145;whom good king Henry brought up and to whom he gave arms and an honour&#146;  (Davis, 303). The honour was that of Wallingford, which he had acquired by his marriage before 1119 to Matilda, lady of Wallingford, who was the heir of Miles Crispin. Matilda's parentage is a matter of continuing scholarly discussion. The earliest contribution to this was made by a local jury in 1183, who stated that Matilda was daughter of Robert (I) d'Oilly (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1093) and wife of Miles Crispin (<i>d</i>. 1107). This would make Matilda a mature lady at the time of her second marriage, and an elderly one when she died; and some later historians suggest Matilda was the daughter of Miles Crispin; but the jurors, some of whom would have known Matilda, may be thought the best witnesses. In addition to Wallingford, also by 1119, Brian had control of the lordship of Abergavenny and Upper Gwent. In the pipe roll of 1129/30 he is shown as having exemptions from geld on 720 hides of land, in eleven counties, and owning a town house in Southwark. He himself rendered account for the borough of Wallingford, and for the office and part of the land of Nigel d'Oilly. The office may have been the constableship previously in the d'Oilly family, for Brian fitz Count attested as constable shortly thereafter.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerandStephensaccession"></a>Early career and Stephen's accession</h2>Brian fitz Count is first recorded at Westbourne in Sussex probably in 1114, when he was a member of the royal household about to cross over to Normandy. It was, however, only after 1125 that he was regularly at court, in the last decade of Henry I's life witnessing over forty of his charters, the majority of them in Normandy. It was a decade dominated politically by Henry's attempt to provide for the succession. Brian was at Woodstock and at Rockingham in the autumn of 1126 immediately after the Empress Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1167) returned from Germany; and in the same year Waleran, count of Meulan, was transferred to his custody at Wallingford. He may be presumed to have been at Windsor on 1 January 1127 when the empress was designated as Henry's &#145;lawful successor&#146;  (Malmesbury, 3); and he and Robert, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1147), then accompanied the empress to Rouen in May 1127 for her betrothal to Geoffrey, count of Anjou. The same two trusted counsellors were responsible for a special audit of the treasury during the financial year 1128/9. In the years 1129 and 1130 Brian was with the king in England and in Normandy. In February 1131 he occurs at Rouen as constable, while in the summer of that year he was at Arques, and a charter addressed to him and the vicomte of Arques suggests that he may then have had control of that castle. In September 1131 he was present at an important meeting of the royal court at Northampton, at which oaths in support of the empress's succession were again sworn. He crossed with the king to Normandy in the summer of 1133, and attested several charters at Rouen in 1134. He saw at first hand the conflict that then developed, in consequence of the demand made by the empress and her husband that the king transfer castles as security for the succession, which he refused them. In the late summer of 1135 Henry was at Argentan, and strengthened its defences; an attestation of Brian there may date from this time.<br>
<br>This conflict provides a part of the context which allowed Stephen of Blois, count of Mortain and Boulogne, to claim the English crown after Henry's death on 1 December 1135. Brian fitz Count cannot have welcomed this development, but initially he went along with it. He was at Stephen's Easter court in late March 1136, and early in April at Oxford when the charter of liberties was issued, by which time Robert, earl of Gloucester, had also come to terms with the king. It may have been at Wallingford that Robert joined the royal court as it travelled along the Thames valley. Both Brian and Robert, as marcher lords, were confronted by the threat posed by the Welsh resurgence after Henry's death. Brian accompanied Richard de Clare when he rode through Abergavenny to Cardigan, but (according to Gerald of Wales) Richard ignored his advice and sent him back, riding alone into an ambush in which he was killed on 15 April 1136. Brian also attested for Stephen at Hereford, in two charters probably dating from May 1138. At this time many of the marcher lords rebelled against Stephen, following the lead of Robert of Gloucester, but Brian is not mentioned among them.<h2>
<a name="Adherencetotheempress"></a>Adherence to the empress</h2>It was only when the empress landed in the autumn of 1139 that Brian fitz Count declared for her. He was then at Wallingford. Robert of Gloucester left the empress outside Arundel and set out for Bristol; and Brian is described by William of Malmesbury as meeting him half way, which might have been at Marlborough. Stephen turned immediately to attack Wallingford, but this &#145;impregnable castle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 91) held out until it was relieved by Miles of Gloucester. Brian is next noted in March 1141, after Stephen had been captured at the battle of Lincoln, as one of those who swore in support of the promises made by the empress to Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1171), the papal legate, after which she was received as <i>domina Anglorum</i> (&#145;lady of England&#146;; Malmesbury, <span class="italic">Historia novella</span>, 47). He would retain a very clear memory of this event. The empress's charters, supported by the chronicles, show that for the remainder of a particularly eventful year Brian was continually at her side. In June he was with her at St Albans, when she came to terms with the Londoners; then at Westminster, where she issued the first of her charters to Geoffrey de Mandeville; and then in July, after the Londoners had driven her out, at Oxford, where Miles of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1143) was made earl of Hereford. Brian followed the empress to Winchester early in September, but she was driven out from here also. In the retreat from Winchester, Robert, earl of Gloucester, was captured, but the empress escaped to Devizes accompanied by Brian, by which&#151;says the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>&#151;they &#145;gained &hellip; a title to boundless fame, since as their affection for each other had before been unbroken, so even in adversity &hellip; they were in no wise divided&#146;  (p. 135). A charter of Miles, earl of Hereford, precisely dated to the last week of September, suggests that Brian and the empress next moved to Gloucester. The empress then sought to establish a base at Oxford, and Brian was with her there at times in 1142, but she was besieged by Stephen's forces in the castle, and at the end of December in that year she made her escape to Wallingford; thereafter, until she withdrew from England in 1148, she was based at Devizes.<h2>
<a name="DefenceoftheAngevincause"></a>Defence of the Angevin cause</h2>The retreat of the Angevin party, back to its original bases in the west country, left the castle of Wallingford exposed, and Brian was tied down to its defence. He resigned his marcher lordships. Having no son of his own, he in effect adopted Walter, the second son of Miles of Gloucester, giving him Grosmont possibly even before 1139 (for the grant was confirmed by Stephen). To Miles himself he resigned Abergavenny, to hold of him in return for the service of three knights. It became difficult even to provision Wallingford garrison. Seeking to defend the detention of goods bound for the fair at Winchester, probably in September 1142, Brian said that he had lost control of the lands which Henry I had given him. &#145;As a result I am in the greatest distress and am not harvesting one acre of corn from the land which he gave me&#146;  (Davis, 302).<br>
<br>Brian was writing in response to a curt letter from Henry, bishop of Winchester, reproaching him for supporting the empress, and threatening that he would shortly be numbered &#145;amongst the unfaithful men of England&#146;  (Davis, 301). Brian sent the bishop a lengthy and passionate defence of his integrity. It was not lack of faith but simple necessity that now led him and his men to self-help: &#145;neither I nor my men are doing this for money or fief or land, but because of your command the lawfulness of myself and my men&#146;. The command had been given at Winchester in April 1141:<blockquote>you yourself who are a prelate of holy church have ordered me to adhere to the daughter of king Henry your uncle, and to help her to acquire that which is hers by right but which has been taken from her by force. (Davis, 301)</blockquote>He called as witnesses no fewer than fifty-three prelates and magnates who had been there, whom he seems to have been able to list from memory. Henry of Winchester, who had heard much in this vein, had told Brian not to look back: &#145;remember the wife of Lot&#146;  (ibid., 301). In response, Brian brushed Lot's wife aside, and looked back to the first crusade. A further list of great men followed, starting with the bishop's father, &#145;who obeyed the pope's command and left so much behind, who by assault and force of arms conquered Jerusalem like good knights, and established there a good and lawful king by the name of Godfrey&#146;. Stephen most certainly was not &#145;a good and lawful king&#146;  (ibid., 301). The demonstration of why this was so was provided by Gilbert Foliot, then abbot of Gloucester, in response to a letter from Brian. This letter (of <i>c</i>.1143) does not survive, but it must have been long&#151;<i>librum edidisti</i> (&#145;you have written a book&#146;; <span class="italic">Letters and Charters</span>, 61, no. 26)&#151;and the courtesies of correspondence led the abbot to pick up some of its themes in his preamble. Here was the reference to the good and golden days of Henry I, now turned to base metal. Here had been a fuller biography, for that king had &#145;brought you up from boyhood, educated you, knighted you, enriched you&#146;  (ibid.). It was quite understandable, granted what had come after, that those days lived vividly in Brian's memory. Now he was sustaining the empress's cause, &#145;not just with arms but with the grace and truth of eloquence&#146;  (ibid.). The abbot then turned to business. Brian had proposed that everything that had belonged to King Henry was by right (<i>iure</i>) owed to his legitimate daughter. Gilbert was prepared to show that this was so by divine, natural, and human law; and this he did at some length. In these few letters, survivals from an active pamphlet warfare, can be seen fully articulated the case for the Angevin succession, a decade before it would be realized. In an age when the biographies even of prominent laymen are difficult to construct, the fragments of autobiography which come from Brian fitz Count have a particular value.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerandreputation"></a>Later career and reputation</h2>After 1142 references to Brian fitz Count are sparse and most often at second hand. When William Martel, one of Stephen's leading lieutenants, was captured at the battle of Wilton in 1143, he was sent as prisoner to Wallingford, where according to Matthew Paris he was placed in <i>cloere</i> <i>Brien</i> (Brian's dungeon), specially constructed for him  (Paris, 2.174). In 1146 Stephen was joined by Ranulf (II), earl of Chester (<i>d</i>. 1153), in a further direct assault on Wallingford; but this too failed. Relations between the garrison of Wallingford and the men of the bishop of Winchester continued on a war footing: one of Brian's knights captured the bishop's castle at Meredon (in Hursley, Hampshire), but it was recaptured with the king's help.<br>
<br>Brian &#145;the son of the count&#146; never became an earl. It is noteworthy that in his letter to Henry of Winchester he gives the title earl to only one of the many creations after 1135, either of Stephen or the empress, which suggests a patrician disdain for new titles. There are signs, however, that in the Angevin camp a distinctive honorific was created for him, since William of Malmesbury describes him as &#145;marchio de Walingeford&#146;, which could equally well be translated &#145;marcher&#146; or &#145;marquess&#146;; it was given as a title to later lords of Wallingford. A further sign of the esteem in which he was held was the grant (<i>c</i>.1144) by the empress to Reading Abbey of the royal demesne manor of Blewbury in Berkshire, &#145;for the love and loyal service of Brian fitz Count, which he has rendered me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. RAN</span>, 3, no. 703); and her son Henry, in 1147 or 1149, confirmed the grant and associated himself with the sentiments. A letter of David, king of Scots, addressing Brian alongside the abbot and convent of Reading, shows that he was viewed as closely associated with the house which Henry I had founded and in which he was buried. Matilda of Wallingford, Brian's wife, maintained a close relationship with the abbey of Bec, granting it the two manors of Ogbourne in Wiltshire which became the centre of their estate in England. The last of her confirmations was issued at Bec in 1150 or 1151; and since Brian was neither present nor mentioned in it, he may be presumed to have died. The gap in the evidence concerning his last days was filled by later tradition. The Abergavenny chronicle stated that he had gone on crusade, but this is unlikely. The memory of the shire was that both he and his wife entered religion, and this is more probable. The quiet end became the man. Brian fitz Count was born illegitimate, and died childless. The distractions and the commitments of family are missing in his career, and this as much as temperament must account for what is distinctive in it. In his day he was a great man, but in his heart he remained always the household knight of Henry I. The love (<i>amor</i>) of which he wrote so frequently, and that he lavished on Henry's daughter, was neither carnal nor platonic but rather the very essence of chivalric loyalty and integrity.<br>
