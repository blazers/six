<span class="headword">Brand,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1600), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was a canon of the Augustinian abbey of Holyrood, Edinburgh, when he made his first recorded contact with the cause of religious reform. In 1560 he was sent by Archbishop John Hamilton of St Andrews to John Knox with a message which expressed sympathy for some aspects of religious reform, but urged restraint and the preservation of the existing church structure in the interests of social stability. This approach had no effect on Knox, and although it is not known how far Brand was himself directly involved in the negotiations, these contacts and the prevailing atmosphere in Edinburgh soon had the effect of causing him to join the reformed church as a minister. Having been examined by John Spottiswood, superintendent of Lothian, he was admitted as minister of the Canongate in 1564, in succession to John Craig. Subsequently he also became minister of Edinburgh Castle. On 5 January 1568 he was appointed chaplain of St Ninian beside Trinity College, Edinburgh. The extant kirk session records show that the parish of the Canongate was well administered from the time of Brand's admission.<br>
<br>Brand was one of the signatories of the letter sent from a meeting of ministers at St Andrews in September 1566 to Theodore Beza, with comments on the second Helvetic confession. At the assembly of June 1567 he was appointed to a commission to confer with crown nominees to consider ecclesiastical jurisdiction and authority as laid down by an act of that assembly. His strong support for the king's party during the troubles of 1571 led to his being banished from Edinburgh for a time. But after a bond had been drawn up on 2 July 1572 a truce was declared on the 31st; the exiles returned and several hundred hagbutters and pikemen marched up the Canongate, with Brand and John Durie, his colleague in Leith, at their head. As a result, within three weeks the queen's party had lost control of the town council to that of the king. The regent subsequently commanded that &pound;58 be paid to Brand out of the thirds of benefices in consideration of his banishment. With his restoration complete, on 24 November he preached before the three estates when they met in the council house in Edinburgh to elect James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, as regent.<br>
<br>Following the demotion of Ninian Hamilton, a pre-Reformation canon of St Giles who had been first exhorter and later minister of Duddingston, to the position of reader, Brand was given the oversight of that parish in 1574; he probably remained minister until the admission of Charles Lumsden in 1588. Thereafter he was frequently a member of deputations sent by the general assembly to the regent and privy council and later to the king. He was appointed to pronounce excommunication against Alexander Gordon, bishop of Galloway, and he was selected by several assemblies to enforce other decisions concerning the episcopate: in April 1577 he replaced John Spottiswood in summoning Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews; in July 1580 he warned Adam Bothwell, bishop of Orkney, to appear before the assembly; and in 1581 and 1582 he was one of the commissioners who met with the king to discuss the case of Robert Montgomerie, archbishop of Glasgow, whom James appointed but whom the kirk forbade to take office. Brand was one of the ministers who attended the earl of Morton before his execution on 2 June 1581. He preached at the opening of the general assembly of April 1582 in the absence of David Lindsay, the previous assembly's moderator. In 1583 he was one of the assessors to the moderator of the October assembly.<br>
<br>During the last decade of his life Brand was appointed the visitor of the churches in Tweeddale; later, with others, to the presbytery of Lothian; and finally within months before his death to the presbytery of Peebles. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> of May 1584, he was among those summoned to subscribe them before the privy council in August. At first he demurred, but he finally signed them along with John Craig in December, an act which caused difficulties for several ministers who were still refusing to sign. Two years later, after these problems had been overcome, he was appointed to an assembly commission to deprive unsuitable ministers. He remained active within the general assemblies and his parish until his death in Edinburgh on 2 September 1600.<br>
<br>Brand was married twice. With his first wife, Elizabeth Johnston, he had a son, James, who on 27 June 1573 received a royal presentation to the chaplaincy of St Thomas-in-the-Canongate for seven years for his sustentation at school, and who had an illegitimate child with Beatrice Delarasche in 1588. With his second wife, Abigail Smith, he had two daughters and a son, John, who as a student at the University of Edinburgh was beheaded in 1615 for murdering William King, an illegitimate son of James King, advocate.<br>
