<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Alexander <span class="st"> [Alejandro]</span></span>, Count O'Reilly in the Spanish nobility  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">army officer in the Spanish service</span>, was baptized on 24 October 1723 at the parish church, Baltrasna, co. Meath, Ireland, the son of Thomas O'Reilly. His father, a Roman Catholic, took the family to Spain and O'Reilly was schooled in Saragossa at the Colegio de Padres de las Escuelas Pias. At the age of eleven he entered the Spanish army and by 1739 he was stationed in Catalonia. He served in the Hibernia infantry regiment in the campaigns against Austria in Italy and in 1741 he travelled to Naples in the army of the duke of Montemar, who promoted him to lieutenant. At the battle of Campo Santo in February 1743 he was shot in the boot and lamed for life.<br>
<br>In 1757 O'Reilly volunteered to join the Austrian army in the war against Prussia so that he could study the new infantry tactics introduced into the Prussian army by Frederick the Great, and he took part in two campaigns against the Prussians commanded by his countryman Count Maurice Francis Lacy. His reports on the Prussian infantry were well received by the Spanish high command and O'Reilly was promoted brigadier in 1759. He served in the war with Portugal from 1761 onwards and gained the reputation of being one of the best officers in Spanish service. At the peace of 1763 he was promoted major-general and appointed governor of Havana in Cuba, where he arrived later that year. By 1764 he was advising the Spanish government to encourage Irish immigration to Cuba as a means of improving the local economy and strengthening the island's defences; in 1765 he was transferred as governor to San Juan in Puerto Rico. In the following year he returned to Spain, where, as inspector-general of the Spanish infantry, he was responsible for introducing Prussian tactics to the whole of the Spanish infantry. Rewarded with the order of Alcantara and the rank of lieutenant-general, O'Reilly was sent to restore Spanish rule in Louisiana in 1769 after the previous governor had been thrown out by the largely French population.<br>
<br>O'Reilly benefited greatly from the personal patronage of Charles III, who created him Count O'Reilly in 1772 and selected him to command the Spanish expedition against Algiers in 1775. The king's choice of a foreigner, however, provoked jealousy among the Spanish officers. His fleet of 40 ships of the line and 350 other vessels carried a force of 22,000 infantrymen, but the ships failed to arrive at Algiers at the same time and the flat-bottomed boats for landing the troops never materialized. Fearing that his ships would run aground, O'Reilly prepared to land and on 8 July put ashore some 10,000 troops under the command of the marqu&eacute;s de La Romana to cover the landing of the rest. The Moroccan counterattack surprised the second landing of Spanish infantrymen, entrenched behind the hedges of prickly pears and aloes, and the Spanish suffered an appalling defeat. 2000 infantrymen were killed, including Romana, and many more were wounded; O'Reilly took full responsibility for the disaster and was exiled to the Chafarinas Islands.<br>
<br>O'Reilly was soon allowed to return to Spain by Charles III, who placed him at the head of the military school, established first at Avila and then at Port Sta Maria in Cadiz Bay. He later became commander-in-chief in Andalusia and governor of Cadiz, but after the death of Charles III he fell into disgrace and was stripped of his military offices and appointments. He retired to Galicia on a small pension, yet his military career was not over for good. Following the outbreak of war with France in 1793 he was restored to his old rank and appointed commander of the naval base at Toulon to help the French monarchists against Bonaparte. The death of General Antonio Ricardos on 11 March 1794 led to his final appointment as commander of the Spanish army in the east Pyrenees. On his way to his troops in Alicante, O'Reilly died from a stroke at a small village, Bonete, in Murcia, Spain, on 23 March 1794. He was married and was survived by his son, Alejandro O'Reilly y Casas (1769&#150;1832), who married a rich Cuban heiress and became commander of the central region of Cuba.<br>
