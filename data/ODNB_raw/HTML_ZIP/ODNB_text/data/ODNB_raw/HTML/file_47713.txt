<span class="headword">Taylor,  James Frater</span>  (1873&#150;1960), <span class="occ">business manager</span>, was born on 23 March 1873 at South College Street, Aberdeen, one of the six children of Alexander Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1887), a ship's mate, and his wife, Mary Lowe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frater. He attended Aberdeen grammar school (1886&#150;8) and by 1891 was an apprentice clerk in Aberdeen. In 1897 he married Frances Alice, the daughter of Joseph Hill of West Hartlepool; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1891 Taylor went out to India as assistant general manager of Madras Electric Tramways, a British company in difficulties. He returned home later that year, and then worked for Samuel Allsopp &amp; Sons Ltd, the brewing giants of Burton upon Trent, also in acute difficulties. Taylor rapidly rose through its ranks; by 1907 he was general manager and director, but in December 1908 he resigned. He was then recruited by a fellow Scot, Robert Fleming, to represent his interest in the Lake Superior Corporation of Canada, owners, <i>inter alia</i>, of Algoma Steel. Taylor, who became Algoma's president, reconstructed the company and made it a sector leader. In 1918 he moved on to manage businesses in which the Bank of Montreal was a large creditor, and eventually set up in Montreal as an independent financial agent.<br>
<br>During the 1920s many very large British industrial concerns faced collapse, with grave implications for the manufacturing economy, employment, and the stability of the banking system. The Bank of England's preferred policy was one of industrial rationalization, and Montagu Norman, the governor of the bank, sought a manager to reorganize Sir W. G. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co. Ltd, one of the largest engineering businesses at risk. Sir Frederick Williams-Taylor of the Bank of Montreal recommended Taylor for the job, describing him as &#145;unimportant in appearance with a clear, keen, sparkling eye, not much given to talking but always very much to the point&#146;. Although not noted for his diplomacy, &#145;he would probably get along with people who are simple, direct and straightforward as himself&#146;. Above all,<blockquote>he gets to the bottom of things. Having decided that a certain course is in the interest of those he has undertaken to serve, he would not easily be moved by opposition nor influenced by considerations of what he proposes would be popular or unpopular. (Barings archives, PF 39, f.108)</blockquote>In July 1925 Taylor became a member of Armstrong Whitworth's board at an annual retainer of &pound;5000 from the Bank of England; he remained a director until 1929. He dismembered the business, eventually converting it into a holding company, merged some parts with competitors, wound up others, and wrote down capital. In 1929 this was described as the &#145;greatest achievement of financial salvage ever attempted&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Economist</span>, 16 Feb 1929), and Taylor emerged as a leading architect of rationalization.<br>
<br>Taylor's success at Armstrong Whitworth underlined his ruthlessness and facility for correcting the business mistakes of others. When in 1926 he joined the Pressed Steel Co. Ltd as a director, he outlined his management methods learned in North America. These involved the production of half-yearly budgets, monthly sales and costs forecasts, monthly balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts; the installation of largely executive boards and local management committees; the appointment of commercially minded engineers; the creation of local cost and profit centres, if need be through the conversion of departments into subsidiary companies; and &#145;a firm grip on the purse strings&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). By the late 1920s he had a deserved reputation at the Bank of England as an excellent manager of big manufacturing business, and he was a natural choice in 1929 as first managing director of Securities Management Trust, a Bank of England vehicle to promote rationalization. In the same year Montagu Norman also arranged for his appointment to the Macmillan committee on finance and industry. Another important appointment in 1929 was as chairman of William Beardmore &amp; Co. Ltd, one of Armstrong Whitworth's tottering competitors. Taylor refused initially, but &#145;reluctantly agreed&#146; after Norman &#145;earnestly begged&#146; him to do so, such was Taylor's standing and Norman's need  (Barings archives, PF 407, f.55). Suffering from recurrent ill health due to overwork, Taylor resigned in December.<br>
<br>After his recovery in 1931, Taylor was appointed chairman of Pease &amp; Partners Ltd, the important Darlington firm with iron and coal interests, which was in grave difficulties. As management expert and Bank of England nominee, Taylor played a key role in industrial reorganization in Britain during the difficult inter-war years. He continued to care for certain Bank of England interests in Newfoundland, and early in 1940 he departed to live in Canada, where he became a self-appointed &#145;general purposes man&#146; for the bank and undertook other commissions for his old contacts. He died at 508 Hycroft Tower, Vancouver, on 23 February 1960.<br>
