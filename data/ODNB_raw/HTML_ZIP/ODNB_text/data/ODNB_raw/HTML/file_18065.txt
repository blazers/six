<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Markham,  Gervase</span>  (1568?&#150;1637), <span class="occ">author</span>, was probably born at Cotham, Nottinghamshire, one of five sons and three daughters of Robert Markham (1536&#150;1606), member of parliament and former high sheriff, and Mary Leake (<i>b</i>. 1538, <i>d</i>. in or before 1597). Gervase had two elder brothers, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18063/', "Francis Markham (1565&#150;1627)")</script>, was the writer of an autobiography. The Markhams were well-connected country gentry: Gervase's father, Robert, had been brought up by the Babington family, who were first cousins, and another first cousin was Sir John Harington.<br>
<br>Gervase's elder brother Francis was educated at Winchester and Cambridge, and it is probable that something similar was true of Gervase. Indeed, he may well be one of the two students simply called Markham who entered King's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1583. But by 1584 a Jarvis Markham is mentioned in a letter as a retainer of the earl of Rutland at Belvoir Castle, 4 miles from the Markhams' seat at Cotham. Markham's movements for the next ten years are unclear, but for part of the time at least he was serving with his brothers in the army in Ireland.<br>
<br>By 1593 Markham seems to have been settled in London, since it was in this year that he registered his first books for publication. One was a poem (now lost) entitled &#145;Thyrsis and Daphne&#146;; the other was <span class="italic">A Discource of Horsmanshippe</span>, a prose tract full of practical advice based on Markham's experience of horses. These two publications were a foretaste of Markham's career to come, in which an astonishing variety of literary publications&#151;poetry, drama, and prose&#151;is combined with an equally astonishing variety of non-literary works on topics such as horsemanship, veterinary medicine, husbandry, domestic economy, and even military training.<br>
<br>Throughout the rest of the 1590s Markham wrote a stream of poems strongly identified with the faction of the earl of Essex. Among them are <span class="italic">The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight</span> (1595), a poem dedicated to Lord Mountjoy, and including a sonnet dedicated to Southampton. In 1596 Markham's <span class="italic">Poem of Poems</span>, an adaptation of the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> into eclogue form, was dedicated to Elizabeth, daughter of Philip Sidney. <span class="italic">Devoreux, or, Vertue's Tears</span> (1597), a translation from the French of Madame Genevieve Petau Maulette, has been described as &#145;almost pure Essex propaganda&#146;  (Poynter, 11); it is a lament for the death in battle of Walter Devereux, brother of the earl of Essex, and is dedicated to his sisters Dorothy, countess of Northumberland, and Penelope, Lady Rich. <span class="italic">Tears of the Beloved, or, The Lamentation of St John</span> (1600) and <span class="italic">Mary Magdalen's Lamentations for the Loss of her Master</span> (1601) complete the sequence of Markham's early poetic publications. Markham's closeness to Southampton, with whom he went on the Islands voyage in 1596, has led Robert Gittings and others to speculate he may be the Rival Poet of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Sonnets</span>. Several extracts from <span class="italic">Grinvile</span> and <span class="italic">Devoreux</span> appeared in <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600), edited by Robert Allott, who had himself written a dedicatory poem for <span class="italic">Devoreux</span>. One 24-line passage from <span class="italic">Devoreux</span>, beginning &#145;I walkt alongst a stream&#146;, was misattributed in Allott's collection to Christopher Marlowe, and long had a place in the Marlowe canon. Not until 1947 was Markham given his due credit for these widely admired lines.<br>
<br>Probably also dating from this early phase of creativity, and similarly linked to radical protestantism, is Markham's prose completion of Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span>. Volume 1 of this project was published in 1607 and volume 2, <span class="italic">The Second and Last Part of the First Book of the English Arcadia</span>, followed in 1613. Also during this period, Markham seems to have been writing for the theatre, as evidenced by a 1596 record of a payment by Henslowe to &#145;marcum&#146;. It has been argued that this is for an early version of <span class="italic">The Dumb Knight</span>, a play which eventually saw print in 1608 in a version modified by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17534/', "Lewis Machin")</script>. In addition, Markham in 1595 published a new edition of <span class="italic">The Boke of St Albans</span> by Juliana Barnes, a collection of domestic advice and recipes first printed in 1486 that foreshadows his own later work. <span class="italic">A Health to the Gentlemanly Profession of Servingmen</span> (1598), yet another product of Markham's indefatigable pen, celebrated the importance of gentleman retainers of great lords. By 1601 Markham had already published eight books of various sorts, not to mention various reprintings; however, in that year his publishing career was interrupted, and he did not print another new work for six years.<br>
<br>Essex's fall was a disaster for all his supporters, and Markham seems to have reacted by leaving London. On 23 February 1601, two days before Essex's execution, Markham married Mary Gelsthorp of Epperstone, Nottinghamshire, at Newark. For some years they seem to have lived quietly in the country. &#145;Yet did I for nine years follow the plow&#146;, commented Markham later, as a tenant farmer on the estate of relatives in Huntingdonshire, and perhaps also on the estate of his cousin Sir John Harington near Bath  (Poynter, 18). In 1606 Markham's father died, and the estate passed to his eldest son, Robert, &#145;a fatal destroyer and unthrift of that eminent family&#146; according to one observer, although the family had been struggling with debts since at least 1595  (ibid., 17). Robert died three years later in 1609, by which time most of the family wealth and property was gone.<br>
<br>By then Gervase Markham had started to resume the two threads of his publishing career. On the literary side, he began with <span class="italic">The Most Famous History of Mervine</span> (1607), a translation from a medieval French story, and followed this with poems including <span class="italic">Rodomonth's Infernall</span> (1607), translated from Ariosto, and <span class="italic">The Famous Whore</span> (1609). On the practical side, he wrote a series of books returning to the subject of horses, starting with <span class="italic">Cavelarice</span> (1607). Partly through his own productivity, and partly through the sharp practice of publishers repeatedly reissuing his work in different forms, it came to pass that five different books on the subject of horses, all of them by Markham, and some of them repeating one another's material, were on the market simultaneously. On 14 July 1617 Markham was forced to sign an unprecedented agreement with the Stationers' Company: &#145;I &hellip; do promise hereafter never to write any more book or books to be printed of the deseases or Cures of any Cattle, as Horse, Oxe, Cowe, Sheepe, Swine, Goates etc.&#146;  (Poynter, 23). Instead, Markham wrote <span class="italic">Hobson's Horse-Load of Epistles</span> (1617), a book of sample letters ready to be adapted to the sender's own particular circumstances. Next he turned to the subject of wildfowling, producing <span class="italic">Hunger's Prevention</span> (1621), a practical guide to the art of hunting birds.<br>
<br>In spite of all this, Markham still found time to dust off a tragedy of his entitled <span class="italic">Herod and Antipas</span>, which had been in existence since at least 1613, but which he now revised with the help of William Sampson. The play was staged at the Red Bull in 1621 and printed the following year.<br>
<br>In 1622, for no obvious reason other than for money, Gervase Markham undertook to travel on foot from London to Berwick without using bridges, &#145;boats, Shippe, or other Ingin for water more than an ordinarye Leape staffe or staffe to leape with all neither shoulde swyme any water whatsoever&#146;. For a 55-year-old man, and even given that his colleague and rival Ben Jonson had four years earlier walked to Edinburgh and back, this challenge was frankly bizarre, and many of his acquaintance bet sums of 5 shillings or thereabouts that he would be unable to complete it. None the less, Markham duly set out, and returned later that year bearing a certificate from the mayor of Berwick, only to find that thirty-nine people, many of them actors associated with the Red Bull, refused to pay up. Markham took legal action against them, stating that he had &#145;groune pore&#146; because of his numerous children and needed the money. The papers, which name numerous actors and where they live, are extant; however, for a long time after their rediscovery in 1910 there was uncertainty about whether the Gervase Markham in question was this man, or his namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73800/', "Gervase Markham (1557&#150;1637)")</script>, or another Gervase Markham entirely. The fact that the list of defaulters includes several actors of Markham's play, and indeed John Trundle, one of his publishers, seems to settle the matter. Less clear, however, is whether Markham succeeded in recovering the money he was owed.<br>
<br>Markham's last years seem to have been spent in poverty in London. He continued his astonishing productivity, writing on the enrichment of the weald of Kent, on garden design, and&#151;in a series of monographs including <span class="italic">The Souldiers Accidence</span> (1625)&#151;on military tactics. He also wrote <span class="italic">Honour in his Perfection</span> (1624), a prose treatise celebrating the past and current military exploits of four aristocratic protestant families. Markham was buried in St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 3 February 1637.<br>
<br>Markham's more literary works have never enjoyed a particularly high reputation, although he was noted as a poet as early as 1598 by Francis Meres in his <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span>. For the most part, commentators have sided with Jonson who derided him as &#145;not of the number of the Faithfull &hellip; and but a base fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, ed. C. H. Herford, P. Simpson, and E. Simpson, 11 vols., 1925&#150;51, 1.137), while his lengthy poem on Richard Grenville has suffered in comparisons with Tennyson's, which, however, it may have influenced. On the other hand, his factual works include a wealth of detail on many aspects of day-to-day living. For the social historian, or the re-enactor, Gervase Markham's numerous works are indispensable guides to the practicalities of Renaissance life.<br>
