<span class="headword">Herbert,  Percy</span>, second Baron Powis  (1598&#150;1667), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was the son of William Herbert, first Baron Powis (1573?&#150;1655), and Lucy Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1650), daughter of Henry Percy, the &#145;wizard earl&#146; of Northumberland. Percy was named in honour of his mother's illustrious family. He belonged to a recusant branch of the Herbert family that lived at Powis Castle, a medieval fortress in the Welsh marches, which was built of striking red sandstone and consequently known as the &#145;red castle&#146;. On 19 November 1622 Herbert married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1600, <i>d</i>. 1662), first surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6635/', "Sir William Craven (c.1545&#150;1618)")</script>, an extremely wealthy alderman of the City of London. Writing to his wife, Herbert counted among his blessings &#145;that your fortune made upp my estate &amp; my conversation resolv'd you a Catholick&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/53/7, no. 33). Herbert was knighted on 7 November 1622, and created baronet on 16 November 1622.<br>
<br>Herbert began public life as MP for Shaftesbury in 1620 and for Wilton in 1624&#150;5. However, he owed what notoriety he achieved in national affairs to his entanglement in the &#145;Welsh army plot&#146; scare. He was alleged in the Long Parliament to have made use of his powers as deputy lieutenant of Montgomeryshire to transfer arms from the county magazine to Powis Castle at the instigation of the marquess of Worcester, who was widely believed to have a commission from the king to receive into Wales an army raised in Ireland for the suppression of parliament (<span class="italic">Commons Journal</span>, 2.463; <span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 349). After a vote in the Commons, Herbert was summoned to London, where he was held under restraint for about eighteen months, before being released on bail. He is said by his wife to have fortified Powis Castle at his own charge, and raised and trained soldiers for the king's army in Wales. However, Lord Powis, Herbert's father, usurped his command, alleging that he had forfeited his commission. The king summoned Herbert to Oxford, where articles were preferred against him. He was then commanded to follow the king on his march to besiege Gloucester, and he took advantage of the distraction caused by the arrival of Essex's army at Gloucester to slip away from the king's camp. There is no evidence that Herbert was a traitor (parliament continued to treat him as a papist and a malignant) but he certainly had reservations about the involvement of Catholics in the civil war, &#145;not that I can doubt the cause (though I doe not like this cause of fighting for the True protestant religion)&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/53/7, no. 33).<br>
<br>In September 1644 Herbert crossed the sea to the Low Countries, taking his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13060/', "William Herbert (c.1626&#150;1696)")</script> with him. He continued abroad until 1649, travelling in Italy, France, and the Netherlands. He was in Italy in 1645. Herbert and young William spent the summer of 1646 in Rome, occasionally dining at the English College. In September, &#145;as soon as the heats began to decline&#146;, they travelled to Naples in the company of Thomas Whetenhall, Maurice and Charles Berkeley, and their tutor Hugh Cressy  (Chaney, 74&#150;5, 368&#150;9). From 1647 to 1648 Herbert was in Paris, where William attended an academy, and his uncle Lord Craven trained him &#145;in manly exercises&#146;.<br>
<br>The county committee for Montgomeryshire resumed the case against Herbert as a delinquent, and the Commons voted to summon him from the continent. He returned to England before the end of May 1649, the deadline stipulated by parliament. Herbert vigorously defended his case, but he was unsuccessful, and his estates were forfeited and sold in 1652&#150;3. These included Hendon manor in Middlesex and several manors in Montgomeryshire. His wife kept Pipewell manor and abbey, Northamptonshire, but the estate was partially sequestered. In 1656 he became second Baron Powis in succession to his father, but nothing is known about his whereabouts in the 1650s, except for two licences issued in the summer of 1658 that gave Powis and his family permission to leave London for their country house  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1658&#150;9</i>, 576&#150;7).<br>
<br>His first publication was <span class="italic">Certaine Conceptions</span> (1650), a book of pietistic and moralistic essays written for his son. He apparently paid for the paper and printing of the first edition (Stationers' Company court book D, fol. 62), but the book proved popular, and there were several subsequent editions. Powis is important in early modern prose fiction as the author of <span class="italic">Cloria and Narcissus</span>, a massive political <i>roman &agrave; clef</i> published in five instalments from 1653 to 1661, which encompasses the Bourbon&#150;Habsburg wars, the English civil wars, the war of the covenant in Scotland, the confederate war in Ireland, and the Fronde in France. The fourth instalment was completed by summer 1656 (Stationers' register, 5 June 1656). Powis died on 19 January 1667. He was succeeded by his son William.<br>
