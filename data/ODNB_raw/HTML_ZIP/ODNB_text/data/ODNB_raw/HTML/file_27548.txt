<span class="headword">Tooke,  William</span>  (1777&#150;1863), <span class="occ">lawyer and promoter of arts and literature</span>, was born in St Petersburg, Russia, on 22 November 1777. He was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27547/', "William Tooke (bap. 1744, d. 1820)")</script>, historian of Russia and chaplain to the factory of the Russia Company at St Petersburg, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Eyton of Llangynhafal, Denbighshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27546/', "Thomas Tooke (1774&#150;1858)")</script>, economist, was his elder brother. William went to England in 1792, and was articled to William Devon, solicitor, in Gray's Inn, with whom he entered into partnership in 1798. Subsequently he went into partnership with Charles Parker at 39 Bedford Row. He remained there for many years before practising instead in the firm of Tooke, Son, and Hallowes. In 1807 he married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1848), youngest daughter of Samuel Shaen, landowner, of Crix Hall, Hatfield Peverel, near Colchester, Essex. Through her nieces' marriages, he was related to Henry Solly, Unitarian social reformer, G. J. Allman, botanist and zoologist, and the archaeologist W. C. Perry.<br>
<br>In 1825 Tooke took a prominent part in the formation of the St Katharine's Dock. He was the London agent of George Barker, the solicitor of the London and Birmingham Railway. He also acted for the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity. He assisted in the foundation of University College, London, and was one of the first council (19 December 1823). He represented the interests of the college in the 1830s, pressing in the Commons for legislation to enable London to grant degrees, rather unwillingly accepting the ambivalent title of the college which was granted its charter in 1836. He was its treasurer until 1841. Tooke procured the charter for the Royal Society of Literature without payment for his professional services. For many years he was an active member of the council of the society, and one of the chief promoters of Thomas Wright's <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica literaria</span>. In 1826, with Lord Brougham, Dr Birkbeck, George Grote, and others, he took part in the formation of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; but in 1846, like many others, he disapproved of the publication of the society's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span> on the grounds that it was too ambitious a project, both intellectually and financially.<br>
<br>Tooke was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 12 March 1818. He was present at the first annual meeting of the Law Institution on 5 June 1827, and was mainly instrumental in obtaining its royal charter of incorporation in January 1832. For some years he was the usual chairman of the meetings and dinners, and when Lord Brougham was considering a measure for the establishment of local courts, he addressed to him a letter in defence of the profession of an attorney. From an earlier period he was a leading member of the Society of Arts; in 1814 he was the chairman of the committee of correspondence and editor of the <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and in 1862 he was elected president of the society. For services rendered to the Institution of Civil Engineers he was elected an honorary member of that corporation. From 1824 he was honorary secretary and from 1840 one of the three treasurers of the Royal Literary Fund Society.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1830, in conjunction with his friend Sir John William Lubbock, Tooke unsuccessfully contested the close borough of Truro. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, however, he was elected on 15 December 1832, and represented the borough until July 1837. He was afterwards a candidate for Finsbury, but did not proceed to a poll, and on 30 June 1841 he unsuccessfully contested Reading. During the five sessions that he sat in parliament he supported reform, and gave his vote for measures for the promotion of education and for the abolition of slavery; but in later life his views were said to have become more conservative. He died at his London residence, 12 Russell Square, on 20 September 1863, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He left two daughters and a son, Arthur William Tooke of Pinner, Middlesex. Tooke was fond of literature and wrote several works, ranging from texts on the poet Charles Churchill and the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, to private publications of his own verse. He was a contributor to the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
