<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pigot,  George</span>, Baron Pigot  (1719&#150;1777), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 4 May 1719 in London, probably at King's Mews, Westminster, the eldest surviving son of Richard Pigot (<i>bap</i>. 1679, <i>d</i>. 1729), clerk of the stables to the prince of Wales, and Frances (1695&#150;1769), dressmaker to Caroline, princess of Wales, and daughter of Peter Godde, a Huguenot who had come to England in the late seventeenth century. George's younger brothers Robert and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22246/', "Hugh Pigot")</script> had distinguished careers in the army and the navy respectively. George Pigot was brought up in his father's household at Westminster and later, after his father's death in December 1729 and his mother's remarriage, in that of his stepfather, John Wyvill, an army officer, at Walton in Surrey.<br>
<br>With the support of Colonel Wyvill, Pigot obtained an appointment as writer in the East India Company's civil service at Madras, where he arrived on 26 July 1737, aged eighteen. In 1746 he was involved in the British d&eacute;b&acirc;cle when the French captured the settlement. As a prisoner Pigot was permitted to go to Britain. In 1750 he returned to Madras and rose though the company's service to become governor in January 1755.<br>
<br>As governor Pigot inherited the policy of resistance to what were taken to be French designs of aggrandizement throughout southern India. Anglo-French rivalry was at first fought out through Indian proxies, the British successfully supporting the claims of Muhammad Ali Khan to be the nawab of the Carnatic against French-backed rivals. Support for Muhammad Ali Khan involved the British in military operations to establish the nawab's authority throughout the Carnatic and thus to enable him to collect the revenue that would pay off the obligations that he owed to his British protectors. In 1756 Pigot and his council at Madras detached a large part of their forces on what turned out to be a triumphantly successful expedition under Robert Clive to restore the British position in Bengal after the disaster of the loss of Calcutta.<br>
<br>Two years later, in 1758, the conflict in south India entered into a new phase. With the arrival of a large French expeditionary force, war would no longer be conducted by Indian proxies. The French under the comte de Lally moved against Madras. Pigot had, however, anticipated them, greatly strengthening the town's fortifications. From December 1758 until February 1759 he organized a vigorous defence in which he personally took a conspicuous role. As Lally withdrew, a reinforced British army under Eyre Coote pursued him, defeated him at Wandiwash, and drove him into the main French settlement at Pondicherry. There the French surrendered in January 1761, Pigot subsequently facing down the royal officers who claimed Pondicherry for the crown and asserting the company's right to annex and raze it to the ground.<br>
<br>With the defeat of the French, Pigot's main task was to settle relations with the nawab of the Carnatic, who was committed to paying large sums for the support rendered to him by his British allies. From time to time solutions were contemplated resembling those that were evolving in Bengal, whereby the company would recover what was owed to it by annexing the nawab's territory, but Pigot left the nawab's territorial authority substantially intact. Muhammad Ali Khan was to survive as a nominally independent ally of the company, although on the eve of his departure in 1763 Pigot forced him to grant valuable territory near Madras to the company.<br>
<br>Pigot resigned his office on 14 November 1763. He returned to England with an assured place in the pantheon of heroes of the Seven Years' War, recognized by the baronetcy conferred on him a year later&#151;and with a great fortune, including a notoriously large diamond. Neither the precise extent of his fortune nor how it had been obtained can be ascertained beyond rumour. It seems highly likely, however, that a large part of what he acquired came from Muhammad Ali Khan, to whom he had rendered signal services in establishing him on the throne and sustaining his authority. The nawab had evidently committed himself to paying Pigot a regular pension in Britain after his return.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his governorship Pigot was described, not unfairly, by the naval officer Samuel Cornish, with whom he had crossed swords, as &#145;a man of supreme vanity and vaunt&#146;  (to Lord Anson, 24 June 1761, TNA: PRO, Adm. 1/162, fol. 138). He was also a man of superabundant physical energy, apparently disregarding normal European inhibitions about the midday sun in directing the fortification of Madras and in gardening at the end of his life. He was ruthless in the pursuit of his objectives, decisive and domineering in office, acquisitive of material wealth to enable him to live in a high style in both India and England, and, it would seem, a considerable sexual predator. He never married but fathered ten children by six different women, forming lasting attachments with only two of them: Leonora Jane Jackson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hepburn (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1761), at Madras and Catherine Hill (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;<i>c</i>.1831) later in England. Their children, especially his two beloved elder daughters, Sophia and Leonora, became full members of his family. Pigot was a dangerous man to cross, as the historian of India Robert Orme, for instance, was to find, but he was a generous patron to a number of younger people.<br>
<br>In England, Pigot pursued the usual avocations of the very rich, leasing grand houses in London, collecting pictures, buying a country estate, and entering the House of Commons. The estate Pigot chose in 1765 was Patshull Hall in Staffordshire with a house recently built by James Gibbs. He paid &pound;80,000 for it. In January 1765 he entered parliament for Wallingford in the interest of the then government of George Grenville. He shifted his support to the new administration of the marquess of Rockingham, from whom he obtained his Irish baronage in January 1766. Two years later he transferred his seat to Bridgnorth, a borough near his Patshull estate.<br>
<br>By the early 1770s Pigot's mind was evidently turning to India once more. Why a man now over fifty should have contemplated such a course is puzzling. There was much speculation that he had run through his fortune and needed to make another one. This cannot be substantiated. If his original fortune had been as large as rumoured, it suggests extravagance on a heroic scale. Perhaps driven as much by a desire to return to public life as by financial need, he showed an interest in the new office of governor-general, created by an act of 1773, when it was awarded to Warren Hastings. He then competed for his old post of governor of Madras, beating a government-backed rival, Thomas Rumbold, by four votes in a ballot of the company's shareholders in March 1775.<br>
<br>The Madras to which Pigot returned in December 1775 was not the Madras he had left twelve years before. Muhammad Ali Khan was still nawab of the Carnatic, but his position had changed greatly. He had been able to build up a considerable influence over the company's servants at Madras, many of whom had invested in the loans at high interest which sustained his government, and he was reaching beyond the company to establish direct links with the British government through agents posted to London. The most striking demonstration of Muhammad Ali Khan's apparent capacity to manipulate British policy had occurred in 1773, when the company's army had conquered for him the territory of the raja of Tanjore, whose autonomy, subject to payment of tribute to the nawab, had been guaranteed in a treaty of 1762 under Pigot's previous governorship.<br>
<br>Pigot carried out with him instructions from the company's directors for a thorough reform of the government of Madras. He was personally committed to carrying through this programme and reducing the influence of the nawab. In particular, the raja of Tanjore was to be restored to full control of his territory with a British garrison in his main fort. Both Pigot and the policies that he was to carry out seem at first to have been widely welcomed among the British at Madras. Within a very short time, however, the execution of the policies was to provoke violent opposition, which culminated in a coup that brought Pigot's government to a premature end.<br>
<br>The nawab could neither be cajoled nor intimidated into consenting to restore the raja of Tanjore. Pigot therefore determined to carry out the restoration regardless, and went to Tanjore in person to do so. The restoration raised the question of what safeguards if any would be given to those who had lent money to the nawab and had been given assignments on the revenue of Tanjore after its conquest in return. Very large sums were involved, the equivalent of some &pound;750,000. The biggest claimant was Paul Benfield, who had until recently been the main financier of the nawab's government. He had some &pound;225,000 secured on Tanjore. Pigot quickly dashed the creditors' hopes that stipulations on their behalf would be included in the restoration of the raja of Tanjore. He evidently believed that the creditors were encouraging the nawab in his intransigence and declined to insist that the restored raja must honour the nawab's assignments.<br>
<br>Opposition to the governor began to grow within a once supportive council and turned into a strong majority against him. Alarm for the safety of their own loans to the nawab was clearly predominant in turning the council against Pigot, but they seem also to have been concerned about the total breakdown of his relations with the nawab and about his increasingly dictatorial ways of conducting business. Pigot would not allow a majority of the council to determine policy against him, and so deadlock ensued. Disaffection spread to the officers of the army, who were concerned about their allowances and some of whom apparently had money invested with Benfield. Army officers, headed by Colonel James Stuart, executed a coup against Pigot to which the dissident councillors, Paul Benfield, and the nawab were clearly parties. Pigot was seized while driving in a chaise with Stuart and taken by force to St Thomas's Mount outside Madras, where he was kept in not very rigorous confinement, while the majority of the councillors assumed the power of government. Appeals were sent by both sides to Britain. Before any outcome could be known in Madras, however, Pigot was dead. In March 1777 he became ill after excessive exposure to the sun gardening on the Mount. He was moved to the company's garden house at Madras, where he died on 11 May and was buried in St Mary's Church at Fort St George on the same day.<br>
<br>Pigot's enemies had undoubtedly chosen to overthrow a legally constituted government by force in order to protect their private interests. They tried to defend themselves by charging that Pigot's motives for restoring Tanjore had been corrupt. Allegations were made that he had accepted large presents from the raja of Tanjore. Such accusations do not altogether strain credulity, but no evidence to support them was ever found. Pigot's determination to curb the nawab's influence did not need to be bought. In the way that he carried out his orders, however, he contributed materially to his own downfall. He had not changed much since 1763; an observer noted his &#145;great spirit&#146; mixed with &#145;excessive vanity and overbearing despotism&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 3.280), but Madras had changed. The nawab could no longer be browbeaten as of old, and although there was much that was corrupt and collusive about his loans, the creditors were a legitimate interest. As subsequent attempts to settle the nawab's debts were to reveal, money had genuinely been advanced to him. Without such loans he would not have been able to meet his obligations, above all to the East India Company. Bringing order to a disordered Madras presidency in 1776 required more finesse than Lord Pigot could muster.<br>
