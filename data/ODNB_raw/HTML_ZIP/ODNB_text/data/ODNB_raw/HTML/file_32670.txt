<span class="headword">Currie <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Curry]</span>, Sir  Arthur William</span>  (1875&#150;1933), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Adelaide township, near Strathroy, Ontario, Canada, on 5 December 1875, the son of William Garner Curry (1845&#150;1891), and his wife, Jane Patterson (1847&#150;1924). Both his parents were Canadian born, their families having originally migrated from Scotland and Ulster. Curry was raised on his father's farm, and educated at Strathroy Collegiate Institute (from 1889) and Strathroy model school.<br>
<br>In 1894 Curry moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and shortly thereafter he became a schoolmaster in Sydney. He moved back to Victoria in 1896 where he continued teaching until 1900, when he began working as an insurance salesman. Soon after arrival in Victoria he joined the militia (1897) as a gunner and changed the spelling of his name to Currie. In 1900 Currie was offered a commission as a 2nd lieutenant. He rose rapidly in rank and by 1909 was commanding officer of the 5th regiment, BC brigade garrison artillery. On 14 August 1901 he married Lucy Sophia (1875&#150;1969), youngest daughter of William Chaworth-Muster of Nottingham, England, and Comax, British Columbia. Currie then went into business for himself; he and his wife had two children, Marjorie (<i>b</i>. 1902) and Garner (<i>b</i>. 1911). In 1904 Currie took over the insurance agency for which he had been working. In 1908 he entered a real estate partnership and began selling and speculating on property. In 1913 he ended his term as commanding officer of the 5th regiment, just as the speculative bubble in west-coast real estate burst. Also in that year he was asked to take command of a newly formed militia unit, the 50th regiment. Deeply in debt when war broke out in 1914, he was not able to accept command of the British Columbia military district. When subsequently offered a brigade in the Canadian expeditionary force he borrowed money, paid off most of his debts, and left to take command of the 2nd Canadian infantry brigade. With this brigade he withstood the onslaught of superior forces at St Julien in 1915 and in the same year was promoted successively colonel and brigadier-general. When the Canadian corps was formed in September 1915 Currie was given command of the 1st Canadian division, and with the rank of major-general led his men on the Somme and at Vimy Ridge. In 1917 when General Byng was promoted to army commander, Currie became the first Canadian to become commander of the Canadian corps. Concerned at the time that his pre-war debts would become an impediment, he took steps to eliminate them. His promotion was approved with the endorsement of Sir Douglas Haig and the Canadian government. Currie's subsequent career was extraordinarily successful. He planned and carried through the battle of Hill 70 (August 1917) and led his corps at Passchendaele (October). Perhaps his and the Canadian corps' greatest achievement was during the fighting from the battle of Amiens (August 1918) through to the Armistice on 11 November, known as the Last Hundred Days. This fighting was the greatest sustained advance for the British forces during the entire war. Currie and the Canadian corps greatly distinguished themselves, but criticism of the campaign was launched in the Canadian parliament, by Sir Sam Hughes, which resulted in post-war controversy and a libel action in 1928 which totally vindicated Currie. He was mentioned in dispatches nine times, was appointed CB in 1915, KCMG in 1917, KCB in 1918, and GCMG in 1919. He received many foreign decorations.<br>
<br>After the armistice Currie remained for a time in command of the Canadian forces on the Rhine and upon his return to Canada he was promoted general, and made inspector-general, and military counsellor to the militia forces of Canada (1919). In 1920 he became principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University. While at McGill he gave his services unsparingly to the Canadian Legion of British Empire Service League, of which he was honorary president; to the Canadian Institute of International Affairs; to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, of which he was a trustee; to the governorship of the Montreal General and Royal Victoria hospitals; and to the Bank of Montreal. Throughout his tenure at McGill, he was a tireless advocate of veterans' rights and benefits. Eighteen universities in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States of America conferred honorary degrees upon him.<br>
<br>Currie was a courageous and resourceful commander possessed of great initiative and an instinctive grasp of tactics. Lloyd George called him a brilliant commander and his own prime minister, Robert Borden, thought him the most able corps commander in the British army. He died of pneumonia in Montreal on 30 November 1933, and was buried in that city. Controversy over Currie's place in Canadian military history has resulted largely from the vicious accusations of Sam Hughes and the ensuing libel action. Legal vindication, however, did not stop subsequent journalistic speculation about the Canadian corps commander. Although not a charismatic individual, he had outstanding tactical skill and organizational abilities. Posthumous discovery that Currie had used government funds issued to his militia unit in 1914 to pay private debts and that he had not replaced them until 1917 contributed to the controversy. His accomplishments as brigade, division, and corps commander during the First World War place him among Canada's most outstanding military leaders.<br>
