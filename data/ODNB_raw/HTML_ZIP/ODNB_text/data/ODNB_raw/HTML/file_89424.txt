<span class="headword">Bucknell,  Robert Barraby <span class="st"> [Barry]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">television presenter</span>, was born at 61 King Henry's Road, Hampstead, London, on 26 January 1912, the elder son and eldest of four children of Arthur Thomas Bucknell, surveyor and valuer, and his wife, Dora Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bromby. He was educated at William Ellis School, Highgate, then served an apprenticeship with Daimler and qualified as a mechanical engineer before working in the garage owned by his father, who had added it to the family building and electrical business he had inherited at St Pancras. As a conscientious objector during the Second World War Bucknell worked for the London fire service and took over the running of the family building business after both his parents were badly injured when a bomb fell on their house. Bucknell was also a Labour borough councillor in St Pancras and served as chairman of the local housing committee, involved with projects to remodel the area, which was devasted during the war.<br>
<br>In 1944 Bucknell married Betty Pearn, who in the post-war years presented cookery programmes on BBC radio. Through this connection, following the birth of the couple's first child (they eventually had two sons and one daughter), Bucknell was asked to talk about fatherhood on another show. His skill for designing gadgets such as a suitcase on wheels and a car for drivers with no legs, combined with the dawn of a consumer society and more people owning their own homes, led to his being hired to contribute practical tips for housewives to the afternoon television programme <span class="italic">About the Home</span> (1956&#150;7). He quickly rose from being one of a panel of experts to having his own spot in the show and its successors, <span class="italic">Mainly for Women</span> and <span class="italic">Domestic Forum</span> (1957&#150;60), as well as in the children's series <span class="italic">Focus</span> (1959&#150;60).<br>
<br>These successes led to Bucknell's own series, <span class="italic">Short Cuts</span> (1956), followed by <span class="italic">Do It Yourself</span> (1960&#150;64), with the presenter dressed in a shirt and tie, his hair slicked back, passing on home-improvement tips&#151;from wallpapering to mending a dripping tap&#151;in a quiet, authoritative manner. He later recalled:<blockquote>The show was very much a one-man effort. I used to build all the shelves, tables, whatever we were using on the programme, in the basement of my own house and transport them <i>en bloc</i> to the studio. Even the rehearsals used to take place in my basement. The early editions were live, and I was dependent on the floor manager to ensure that things like screws were close at hand. The whole show could fall apart without a few screws, and it didn't look very good if I had to search around for them. And it wasted valuable air-time. (Kingsley and Tibballs, 36)</blockquote>Some of Bucknell's quick-fix solutions, involving, for instance, covering period features such as fireplaces, were later derided, but he established a reputation as television's Mr DIY (although he was not British broadcasting's first celebrity handyman, that honour going to W. P. Matthew, who contributed to BBC radio before hosting his own television series, <span class="italic">Household Hints</span>). Even more popular was <span class="italic">Bucknell's House</span> (1962&#150;3), in which the presenter renovated a derelict Victorian terraced property, 79 The Grove, Ealing, London, complete with dry rot, wet rot, and woodworm, over thirty-nine weeks, despite a surveyor advising against the project. The series attracted up to six million viewers and a postbag of 37,000 letters a week, and the house, bought by the BBC for &pound;2,250, was sold at auction for &pound;7,000 in 1964 after being converted into two modern flats.<br>
<br>With Jack Holt, Bucknell also designed a family sailing dinghy, sponsored by the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>&#151;complete with red Viking sails to match the newspaper's masthead&#151;which was launched at the 1963 London boat show. More than 90,000 models of the Mirror dinghy were eventually sold and, in 1986, it went on permanent display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.<br>
<br>Bucknell switched to ITV to present the Sunday lunchtime show <span class="italic">The ABC of Do It Yourself</span> (1966), before returning to the BBC for his final series, <span class="italic">Car Wise</span> (1967&#150;8). He subsequently contributed to other programmes and appeared in television commercials. In the 1970s he contributed a year-long series of articles to <span class="italic">TV Times</span> describing a new &#145;Bucknell's house&#146; renovation, this time in Luton, but he wound down his television appearances partly because of increasing deafness. He wrote a number of popular books, including <span class="italic">Do It Yourself</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Bucknell's House</span> (1964), <span class="italic">The ABC of Do It Yourself</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">Barry Bucknell About the House</span> (1976), as well as the <span class="italic">Make It Yourself</span> series (1961).<br>
<br>Throughout his time as a television presenter Bucknell had continued to work in the family business, of which he became managing director. In later years he spent increasing time on boat design. Retiring with his wife to the Cornish coast, he continued to enjoy his lifelong hobby of sailing. In his younger days he had also been a keen squash player, skier, and glider pilot. He died on 21 February 2003 at his home, The Red House, St Mawes, Truro, Cornwall, of pneumonia, and was survived by his wife, Betty, and their three children.<br>
