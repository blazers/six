<span class="headword">Vere,  John  de</span>, sixteenth earl of Oxford  (1516&#150;1562), <span class="occ">magnate and rake</span>, was the eldest of four sons (there were also four daughters) of <a name="cosubject_28215"></a><span class="headword">John  de Vere</span>, fifteenth earl of Oxford  (1482&#150;1540), and his second wife, Elizabeth Trussell (<i>b</i>. 1496, <i>d</i>. in or before 1527), daughter of Edward Trussell of Kibblestone, Staffordshire. He was born at Hedingham Castle, Essex, and educated privately.<br>
<br>The fifteenth earl of Oxford was the son of John de Vere and Alice Kilrington (alias Colbroke) and grandson of a younger son of Richard de Vere (<i>d</i>. 1417), the eleventh earl; he succeeded his second cousin John de Vere, fourteenth earl (1499&#150;1526), whose disorderly personal life Cardinal Wolsey had attempted to regulate, but which left him without legitimate issue. The cadet John had no heirs from his childhood marriage to Christian Foderingey (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1481, <i>d</i>. in or before 1498), but paid the crown 2000 marks for the Trussell heiress and married her between 1507 and 1509. By 1509 de Vere was Henry VIII's esquire of the body; he was knighted serving him in France in 1513. He attended Henry at meetings with Fran&ccedil;ois I and Charles V in 1520. Wolsey's support helped him procure in 1526 a life grant of the great chamberlainship, which had descended in the senior line of his family, and he was made a knight of the Garter the following year. He signed the lords' petition against Wolsey on 1 December 1529. Associated with the divorce faction and by 1531 a royal councillor, Oxford bore the crown at Anne Boleyn's coronation, but later served on commissions trying her and her alleged lovers in 1536 and also the panels for the Courtenay conspiracy trials in 1538. Reputedly protestant, he was granted monastic lands in Essex worth &pound;160 p.a. A Venetian report in 1531 asserted that he was &#145;a man of valour and authority &hellip; and it is his custom always to cavalcade with two hundred horse&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1527&#150;33</i>, 295). The fifteenth earl died at Earls Colne, Essex, on 21 March 1540 and was buried at Castle Hedingham on 12 April.<br>
<br>The sixteenth earl, who held the courtesy title Lord Bulbeck during his father's lifetime, lost any chance of succession to the great chamberlainship when Thomas Cromwell acquired it. He had joined his father in attending the king when he met Anne of Cleves at Blackheath in January 1540. He took part in Henry's Boulogne campaign of 1544 as captain of the rearguard, unusually bringing a contingent with firearms rather than horses. Oxford was one of the twelve chief mourners at Henry VIII's funeral, as later at Edward VI's. However, Stephen Gardiner complained that his players were disrupting the mourning a week after Henry's death. He was knighted at Edward VI's coronation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the earl's private life had established a pattern of disorder (recalling the fourteenth earl's), to which testimonies were collected in 1585 when the legitimacy of his heir was impugned. On 2 July 1536 he married Dorothy Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, fourth earl of Westmorland (1498&#150;1549), and Katherine Stafford; a great wedding reception, shared with two Manners&#150;Neville matches, followed, attended by Henry VIII. The marriage settlement was confirmed by statute: altogether the union was rather firmer than he later wished. Dorothy bore him a daughter, Katherine (1538&#150;1600), but left him on 6 June 1546. Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, who had married her maternal aunt, tried to persuade Dorothy to return, &#145;but she said she wold never goe home agayne amongst such a bad comanye as were about the Earle of Oxford at that tyme&#146;  (Hunt. L., MS EL 5870). It included the gambler John Lucas, master of requests, who was said to have won from Oxford &#145;the wardshipe of Mistress Roydon at dice&#146;  (Metcalfe, 235&#150;6); perhaps also the company of players whose maintenance had been a family tradition since at least 1492. Oxford's &#145;unkynde dealinge&#146; with Dorothy by 1546 ranged from maintaining as a mistress Anne, servant of his tenant at Tilbury Hall, to apparently marrying bigamously Joan Jockey (<i>d</i>. 1585) of Earls Colne.<br>
<br>Family as well as religious disputes may have underlain the altercation in the presence chamber at Westminster in 1552 when Henry Neville, Lord Bergavenny, struck Oxford, drawing blood. Dorothy's death on 6 January 1548 might have provided opportunity to reduce Oxford's entanglements. Presumably it was after this that, with others, Sir Thomas Darcy and Edmund, Lord Sheffield, husbands of Oxford's sisters Elizabeth and Anne, had violently attacked Joan Jockey and &#145;cutt her nose&#146;  (Hunt. L., MS EL 5870), possibly to brand her a whore.<br>
<br>The incorrigible Oxford was already involved with Dorothy Fosser, his daughter Katherine's waiting woman. Darcy on 27 June 1547 informed Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and protector, that the banns had twice been asked between them. Darcy, who suggested that Dorothy be replaced by the daughter of the local magnate Thomas, Lord Wentworth, also acted as Somerset's agent in having Dorothy physically removed and Oxford effectively treated as mentally incompetent. On 1 February 1548 Somerset induced the earl to promise Katherine to his younger son, Henry, enforced by the substantial bond of &pound;6000. Somerset, who now had the great chamberlainship, also insisted on &#145;the clere extinction of his [Oxford's] pretenced clayme to the saide office&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 93). From 1 February Somerset had also forced Oxford to convey all of his lands to him by an indenture and levied fines later that month and in April.<br>
<br>Oxford apparently again had banns asked for marriage to Dorothy Fosser, but suddenly abandoned this, compensating her with an annuity of &pound;10. On 1 August 1548 he was married irregularly, without banns, to Margery Golding, daughter of John Golding of Belchamp St Paul, Essex, and half-sister of the translator Arthur Golding. With her he had the coveted male heir&#151;unfortunately of contestable legitimacy after Oxford's vagaries&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28208/', "Edward de Vere, later seventeenth earl of Oxford (1550&#150;1604)")</script>, and a daughter, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1624?), who married Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby. Oxford's marriage therefore appears to have been an attempt to escape Somerset's hold by producing a son, thus thwarting plans for Katherine to become the earl's sole heir. Eventually Katherine de Vere married Edward, Baron Windsor, and Henry Seymour married Jane Percy.<br>
<br>Drawing up his will on 21 December 1552, Oxford not only affirmed the royal supremacy, but insisted that his salvation was &#145;not to be Justyfied by eny good deede that ever I did, for I knowledge that all the Deedes and workes that ever I wroght were they never so righteous, be but as filthynes in the sight of God&#146;  (BL, Stowe Charter MS 633). Oxford's protestantism probably encouraged him to sign the letters patent of 16 June 1553 nominating Jane Grey to succeed Edward VI. According to Robert Wingfield, he imprisoned Clement Tusser in Hedingham Castle for proclaiming Mary, but Tusser successfully canvassed the support of Oxford's &#145;menial servants&#146;. &#145;The earl professed himself much moved by their words&#146; and encouraged his &#145;hundred common servants remarkable for their stature and strength&#146; to confine the pro-Grey &#145;gentlemen&#146; of his household, including several of the Golding family  (MacCulloch, 264). He planned to take his men to join Mary, but was directed to secure Ipswich instead. Ostensible compulsion was useful insurance for his change of sides, but Oxford's adherence to Mary did not necessarily inspire great trust, though it did get him the great chamberlainship back (from William Parr, marquess of Northampton). In 1555 Oxford was instructed to assist with the burning of heretics at Colchester and Manningtree, which apparently he did, but the next year his opposition to Spanish marriage plans led to vague suspicion of implication in Henry Dudley's plot.<br>
<br>Oxford obtained from Elizabeth I confirmation of his great chamberlainship, which he claimed as his hereditary right, and also the lord lieutenancy of Essex. He sat to try Lord Wentworth&#151;a competitor for local influence&#151;for losing Calais. He entertained the Swedish prince John (wooing the queen for his brother) in September 1559 and Elizabeth herself in August 1561, having demonstrated his political reliability by his zeal first in 1560 against slanderers of the queen and then in spring 1561 against Sir Thomas Wharton and Sir Edward Waldegrave, Marian councillors and now frequenters of illegal masses.<br>
<br>Oxford died at Hedingham Castle on 3 August 1562 and was apparently buried in the church there (although his will had specified Earls Colne) on 31 August. His widow, Margery, married Christopher (or Charles) Tyrell, died on 2 December 1568, and was buried with the earl. Public spirited though his will might appear, the sixteenth earl's rakish and violent private life, set in a rather old-fashioned, oversized, and disorderly household, limited his capacity for a wider role. Unlike his father, he was not considered privy council or Garter material. He did at least preserve his wealth and standing as a magnate, unlike his own son.<br>
