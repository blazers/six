<span class="headword">Watkins,  Dudley Dexter</span>  (1907&#150;1969), <span class="occ">comic artist</span>, was born on 27 February 1907 at 40 Cedar Street, Cheetham, Manchester, and brought up in Nottingham. He was the eldest of the three children of James Willie Watkins, a lithographic artist, and his wife, Eva Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dexter. Watkins displayed his inherited skill at an early age: when he was six he received a commendation from the mayor of Nottingham for his drawing of a parade and, later, had his work included within an exhibition at Nottingham Castle. In 1919 he attended evening classes at Nottingham School of Art and in the early 1920s took a job with Boots the chemist. His first published work appeared in March 1923 in Boots's staff magazine, <span class="italic">The Beacon</span>. Not long afterwards he was offered a position as a staff artist with D. C. Thomson, a publisher based in Dundee, and, after returning to art school for a year, moved to Dundee in 1925. The Scottish publisher had recently started a line of boys' story papers which were published weekly. The first was <span class="italic">Adventure</span> (1921), followed by <span class="italic">The Rover</span> and <span class="italic">The Wizard</span> (both 1922). Eventually there would be two more: <span class="italic">The Skipper</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">The Hotspur</span> (1933); collectively they became known as <span class="roman">The Big Five</span>. From his early employment with the firm and throughout the 1930s he contributed hundreds of drawings and paintings to these weeklies. Watkins's black and white illustrations to text stories also appeared in the Scottish publisher's <span class="italic">Topical Times</span>, an adult Thomson paper. On 8 March 1936 D. C. Thomson broke new ground in the UK with the inclusion of an American-style comic supplement entitled &#145;The fun section&#146; with its newspaper the <span class="italic">Sunday Post</span>. Dudley Watkins drew two features: <span class="italic">Oor Wullie</span> (<span class="roman">Our Willie</span>) and <span class="italic">The Broons</span> (<span class="roman">The Browns</span>). Both are still running. Until the 1970s the artwork remained that of Watkins, his drawings being reprinted after his death. The success of &#145;The fun section&#146; suggested to D. C. Thomson that a national comic was viable and the firm soon launched not just one but two weeklies: the <span class="italic">Dandy Comic</span> (4 December 1937) and the <span class="italic">Beano Comic</span> (30 July 1938). For the <span class="italic">Dandy</span> Watkins drew <span class="italic">Desperate Dan</span>; for the <span class="italic">Beano,</span> <span class="italic">Lord Snooty</span>. The former was a cowboy with a ten-gallon hat and permanent heavy stubble on his chin; he shaved with a blow-torch, swung bulls around his head by their tails, and carried his horse when it got too tired to carry him. Lord Snooty was a young aristocrat in a top hat and Eton suit who would rather fraternize with urchins than toffs. Both Dan and Snooty have become internationally well known and are national institutions in the UK. These classic comic characters and other lesser-known features Watkins continued to draw weekly until the 1960s.<br>
<br>Following the successful launch of the <span class="italic">Beano</span> and <span class="italic">Dandy</span> Dudley Watkins's status as the Dundee firm's principal artist was confirmed. He was not only one of the most prolific artists but also extremely versatile. Watkins also was able to turn out adventure stories in comic form. These included: <span class="italic">The Shipwrecked Circus</span> (<span class="italic">Beano</span>, 1943); <span class="italic">Jimmy and his Magic Patch</span> (<span class="italic">Beano</span>, 1944); <span class="italic">Danny Longlegs</span> (<span class="italic">Dandy</span>, 1945); and <span class="italic">Our Teacher's a Walrus</span> (<span class="italic">Dandy</span>, 1947). In the late 1940s he also drew classic adventure serials for Thomson's magazine the <span class="italic">People's Journal</span>. These included <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span>, <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span>, and <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> and were later reprinted in book form. In the 1950s Dudley Watkins became a principal contributor to D. C. Thomson's first post-war comic, <span class="italic">The Topper</span> (7 February 1953); he drew <span class="italic">Mickey the Monkey</span> on the front page and had several of his serials from <span class="italic">People's Friend</span> reprinted on the back in full colour. Similarly his work was to be found on the front page of <span class="italic">The Beezer</span> (21 January 1956) with <span class="italic">Ginger</span>, a slightly older version of <span class="italic">Oor Wullie</span> which he was still drawing for the <span class="italic">Sunday Post</span>. From 1946 he started to sign his work. His clear, distinct signature, &#145;Dudley D. Watkins&#146; (or &#145;D. D. W.&#146;), was noted by millions and led to him being the best-known of all British comic artists. Watkins was a member of the Church of Christ of Dundee and used his art to help the religious movement. From 1956 he produced a series called <span class="italic">William the Warrior</span> for the Worldwide Evangelization Crusade. These were comic strips published in small, paperback booklets. He lived at Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, and died of a heart attack there on 20 August 1969. Dudley Watkins was survived by his wife and son. If one man could be said to epitomize post-war British comics it would be Watkins; his influence is still apparent more than thirty years after his death.<br>
