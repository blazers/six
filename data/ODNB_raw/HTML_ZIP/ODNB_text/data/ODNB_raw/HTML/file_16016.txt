<span class="headword">Langhorne,  Daniel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1681), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in London, and matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1649. His parentage is unknown, but his family was probably collateral to the Langhornes of Westmorland, from whom Isabella, the mother of Benjamin Jowett, master of Balliol College, Oxford, was descended. He became a scholar of Trinity, and graduated BA in 1654 and MA in 1657. He was appointed curate of the parish church of Holy Trinity, Ely, then newly constituted from the lady chapel of the cathedral, and after the Restoration was licensed by Bishop Wren in 1662 to preach there and throughout the diocese. In 1663 he was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and having graduated BD in the following year became one of the university preachers. He vacated his fellowship in 1671 after his institution as vicar of Layston with the chapelry of Alswick, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>In accord with the quickening interest in early English history in both universities, Langhorne devoted his studies to early British history and the settlement and eventual unification of the English kingdoms. He was well versed in the evidence of the chronicles, but he wrote at a time when the wilder extravagances of the legendary British history had generally been rejected, and before archaeology, philology, and critical documentary techniques had been able to put anything else in their place. Like his contemporaries he was aware of that gap, and he said of Geoffrey of Monmouth's history, sensibly enough, that although much of it was palpably ridiculous, there might be a substratum of truth, at least in the sense of distorted recollection, remaining in it. His first study was <span class="italic">Elenchus antiquitatum Albionensium, Britannorum, Scotorum, Danorum, Anglosaxonum et ceterorum: origines et gesta usque ad annum 449, quo Angli in Britanniam immigrarunt, explicans</span> (London, 1673). It was dedicated to Sir William Montagu, attorney-general to Queen Caroline and later chief baron of the exchequer, and was followed by <span class="italic">Appendix ad elenchum antiquitatum Albionensium: res Saxonum et Suevorum vetustissimas exhibens</span> (London, 1673). An English version of the two volumes, <span class="italic">An introduction to the history of England, comprising the principal affairs of this land from its first planting to the coming of the English Saxons, together with a catalogue of British and Pictish kings</span>, appeared in 1676. In 1679, and on rather firmer ground, he published <span class="italic">Chronicon regum Anglorum, insignia omnia eorum gesta ab Hengisto rege primo usque ad Heptarchiae finem</span>, dedicated to Sir Joseph Williamson, secretary of state. There is no obvious connection between Langhorne and his dedicatees, neither of whom was an outstandingly edifying member of the political community, though Williamson, a busy man, was known sometimes to temper his customary parsimony with charitable acts.<br>
<br>The quest for patronage was, however, a convention as well as a resource, and Langhorne derived other satisfactions from his work. He died on 10 August 1681, with his history incomplete, as he apparently intended to carry it at least to the Norman conquest. Forty years later Thomas Hearne asked Thomas Baker, the Cambridge antiquary, for information about Langhorne, and was told, beside the facts of his career, that Baker had seen a manuscript version of the second part of the history. This was probably the handsome text later prized by the antiquary Dawson Turner. It may be that, like Dugdale, Langhorne habitually wrote an exquisite hand, but he seems also to have enjoyed matching the best of his exemplars.<br>
