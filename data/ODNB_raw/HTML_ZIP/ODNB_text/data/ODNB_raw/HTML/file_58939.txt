<span class="headword">Thompson,  Josiah</span>  (<em>c.</em>1724&#150;1806), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and historian</span>, was born at Shrewsbury, the son of the Revd Josiah Thompson (1692&#150;1780), Baptist minister. He was born in the same parish as the Revd Job Orton (1717&#150;1783), with whom he later corresponded for many years. From October 1742 he was educated for the nonconformist ministry at John Eames's academy in Hoxton on the Coward Trust foundation. In June 1744, &#145;having lately had a considerable legacy left him&#146;  (Coward Trust minutes, 74), he refused any further financial help. In November 1744, after he had been called to the ministry by the church at Prescott Street, London, he was dismissed to be minister of the church at Unicorn Yard, Southwark. He was ordained on 23 February 1746. He resigned his charge in August 1761, according to Ivimey, the Baptist historian, because of ill health. Another source states his resignation was &#145;upon some change of sentiment&#146;, having originally been a strict Calvinist  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 282). Having inherited a considerable estate he was able to live in retirement as a gentleman for the rest of his life and preached only occasionally. Although his property &#145;gave him weight with his denomination&#146;, they did not hold him in very high regard  (Wilson, 4.236). He &#145;does not appear to have done much good as a minister&#146;  (Ivimey, 3.427) was Ivimey's view, but Orton had a more favourable opinion. He heard Thompson give the charity sermon at Shrewsbury in June 1778 &#145;with great acceptance&#146;, and when a larger collection &#145;than ever before&#146; was made  (<span class="italic">Letters to Dissenting Ministers</span>, 1.199). Thompson's considerable property made him increasingly conservative following the French Revolution. Robert Aspland failed to obtain a grant from the Ward Trust in 1797 to study at the Bristol Baptist Academy because Thompson, the senior trustee, considered both Aspland and the institution too radical. Unusually for a dissenting minister, Thompson was said to be a devoted supporter of William Pitt, giving &pound;100 to assist the prosecution of the war against France.<br>
<br>In retirement Thompson undertook to collect materials for a history and account of the contemporary state of dissenting congregations in England and Wales. The work was prompted by the application made to parliament in 1772 for the relief of dissenting ministers and teachers. Through an extensive local correspondence Thompson acquired a mass of historical and contemporary information relating to about half the estimated 600 dissenting congregations in the country, which he arranged on a county basis and copied into a series of volumes. The collections, which he left in his will to Dr Williams's Library, are of considerable importance, not only for the statistics recording the number of congregations and ministers in 1772&#150;3 but for the histories of many congregations &#145;taken from their Church Books, the Testimony &amp; Report of old People, private Papers, &amp; other authentic Records&#146;  (DWL, MS 38.7, preface), which are no longer available to the historian. Some of the accounts of individual congregations or of churches are of wider significance, notably the account of the rise of the Baptist New Connexion in Leicestershire. Thompson lived for many years in the house of Benjamin Stinton in Bury Street, London, and after Stinton's death with his widow. He moved with the family to Clapham, where he usually preached once a month, though he also assisted other ministers. He married late in life, but continued to live with his friend Mrs Stinton, to whose relations he was said to have left his substantial fortune, having no family of his own, and &#145;in whose vault at Bunhill-fields he desired to be buried&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 283). He died on 4 June 1806 at Clapham.<br>
