<span class="headword">Vidler,  William</span>  (1758&#150;1816), <span class="occ">Universalist minister and Unitarian preacher</span>, was born on 4 May 1758 at Battle, Sussex, the tenth and last child of John Vidler (<i>d</i>. 1780) and Elizabeth Bowling. He was apprenticed to his father, a stonemason, a trade for which, as an asthmatic, he was hardly suited. When George Gilbert came to Battle in 1776 an independent Calvinist church was organized. Vidler joined and started preaching. He seems to have received some training with Mr Nairne, vicar of Godshill, Isle of Wight, from 1777 to 1778. After he was persuaded of the correctness of believer's baptism and baptized by Mr Purdy of Rye (January 1780), the Battle church re-established itself as a Particular Baptist church. Although Vidler, called to be its minister, was still working as a stonemason, the number of members rose from 15 to 150. They took over and pulled down the disused Presbyterian meeting-house and built a new one, which left them &pound;160 in debt.<br>
<br>Vidler offered to travel afield to collect funds. At the same time he took the opportunity to test the doubts which the Universalist Elhanan Winchester's <span class="italic">Dialogues on the Universal Restoration</span> had raised for him. After meeting John Ryland and Andrew Fuller in Northampton, he continued into Lincolnshire, where Winchester had followers among the General Baptists. He returned to Battle a convinced believer in the universal restoration of all humankind. This provoked the withdrawal of a minority of the church; while the majority remained they were eventually expelled from the local Particular Baptist association.<br>
<br>Vidler fortified his allegiance with Winchester, and in 1794 he became Winchester's assistant at Parliament Court Chapel, London, and then, in 1796, his successor. With John Teulon, Vidler opened a bookshop, first in the Strand and then in High Holborn. They started a periodical, the <span class="italic">Universalists' Miscellany</span> (from 1805 the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>), among whose readers was the Unitarian missionary Richard Wright. Wright became Vidler's friend and convinced him of the truth of Unitarianism. This divided the Parliament Court congregation, which in turn divided the General Baptist assembly when Parliament Court joined in 1803.<br>
<br>Vidler ardently promoted both Universalist and Unitarian views. He was associated with a number of new Universalist and Unitarian societies at Northiam, Rye, Steyning, Reading, and Boston, and in &#145;the North Marches of Lincolnshire&#146;. He co-founded, with Richard Wright, the Unitarian Evangelical Society (1804) and the Unitarian Fund (1806) (from 1825 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, and from 1928 the general assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches). Their evangelical fervour did much to transform the conservative rational dissent of the eighteenth century into the more vigorous Unitarianism of the nineteenth. Meanwhile Parliament Court Chapel (from 1824 South Place Chapel, Finsbury) became the South Place Ethical Society (from 1927 at Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, London).<br>
<br>Vidler published <span class="italic">God's Love to his Creatures</span> (1799), in which he held that God's love extends to animals; <span class="italic">Letters to Mr. Fuller on the Universal Restoration</span> (1803); and new editions of Paul Siegvolk's <span class="italic">The Everlasting Gospel</span> (1795) and Winchester's <span class="italic">Dialogues on the Universal Restoration with a Memoir of its Author</span> (4th edn, 1799). He was also associated with Nathaniel Scarlett's <span class="italic">A Translation of the New Testament from the Original Greek</span> (1798).<br>
<br>On 7 September 1780 Vidler had married Charity Sweetingham (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1808), daughter of William Sweetingham of Battle. They had five children, three of whom survived him&#151;a daughter, who married William Smith, the Parliament Court organist; Ebenezer, a sailor; and William (<i>d</i>. 24 March 1861), missioner at Chapel Street Domestic Mission, London.<br>
<br>Vidler was excessively large and always booked two seats when travelling. While returning to London from Wisbech in 1808 to see his dying wife, the post-chaise in which he was travelling fell down a steep bank. Never fully recovering from the accident, he delivered his sermons from then on sitting down. He died on 23 August 1816 at his home in Spencer Street, Northampton Square, London. He was buried on 28 August in the graveyard of the Unitarian chapel at Hackney.<br>
