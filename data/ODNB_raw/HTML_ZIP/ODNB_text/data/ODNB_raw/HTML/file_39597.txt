<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamel,  Gustav Wilhelm</span>  (1889&#150;1914), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 25 June 1889, the only son in a family of four children of Dr Gustav Hugo Hamel (1861&#150;1922) and his wife, Caroline Magdalena Elisa (1864/5&#150;1960), a German-speaking Dane from Schleswig-Holstein. His father had been born in Hamburg and educated in Sweden and Switzerland, where he took his medical degree; he moved to London and built up a wide medical practice. One of his patients was Edward VII, and Dr Hamel was appointed MVO for medical services rendered to the king on the occasion of his visit to Hamburg in 1901. Edward VII was a regular visitor to the doctor's Grosvenor Square home, often after his daily ride, but Mrs Hamel, who retained her strong German accent all her life, would refuse to allow him to bring his terrier Caesar upstairs to the family drawing room. She died aged ninety-five at Robert Adam Street, London, in February 1960.<br>
<br>Hamel was educated at Westminster School from 1901 to 1907. Although his parents hoped he would take up medicine, Gustav was attracted to motor racing and enthusiastically followed the sport across Europe for two years. He made his first ascent in a balloon in the summer of 1909, flying from London to Peterborough. Attracted to the pioneering flights of the French aviators, by autumn 1910 he had become a pupil at the Bl&eacute;riot flying ground at Issy-les-Molineaux, France; he moved to Pau when the aviators went south for the winter in search of more favourable weather conditions. On his first flight, he was observed by M. Bl&eacute;riot, who remarked that he had never seen so apt a pupil.<br>
<br>Hamel obtained his brevet de l'Aero Club de France on 3 February 1911, certificate no. 358, flying a Morane monoplane. On 14 February, following his test flight on a Bl&eacute;riot monoplane, Hamel acquired his Royal Aero Club &#145;ticket&#146;, no. 64. He subsequently transported his own 50 hp Gn&ocirc;me Bl&eacute;riot from France to Britain and in March won first prize in a cross-country race from Hendon to Brooklands. He made his first flight to Brighton in April 1911, and landed on the lawns beside the seafront at Hove. From then until his untimely death, his flights were extensively reported in the national press. At Hendon on 11 May 1911 he was invited to demonstrate the military potential of aircraft in time of war before the parliamentary committee concerned with aerial defence. He flew to Farnborough and back carrying military dispatches, performing far faster than any cavalryman and out of reach of gunfire from the ground by arriving back over Hendon at 4000 feet.<br>
<br>Following the coronation of George V, and on the suggestion of Sir Walter Windham, permission was given by the postmaster-general for the first British aerial postal service. Hamel piloted a Bl&eacute;riot on the inaugural flight from Hendon to Windsor Castle on 9 September 1911, in adverse weather conditions. Mail flights continued for ten days and raised funds to endow the &#145;coronation aerial post bed&#146; at the King Edward Hospital, Windsor.<br>
<br>Hamel made his first cross-channel flight from Boulogne to Wembley Park on 12 October 1911, ferrying a Bl&eacute;riot from the Hardelot factory. On 2 April 1912 he flew from London to Paris in a two-seater Bl&eacute;riot monoplane with Miss Trehawke Davies, the first female passenger to be carried by air across the channel. They were entertained to lunch by Bl&eacute;riot and then flew on to Paris. She was to make a total of eight channel crossings with Hamel; he made twenty-one. By Good Friday he was back at Hendon, having achieved a new height record of 6000 feet. On 8 June 1912 he competed in the first aerial Derby, an 81 mile anticlockwise circuit of London, again with Miss Davies as passenger. His friend Thomas Sopwith finished ahead of him, but was disqualified for flying within one of the turning points, and the race was awarded to Hamel. On 12 June he flew to Ranelagh and, watched by the king and queen, gave exhibition flights over the polo grounds before landing and being received at the royal pavilion.<br>
<br>Many and varied were Hamel's exhibition locations, from demonstrations at local flower shows to meetings held on racecourses. Enormous crowds flocked to the venues, and in his Bl&eacute;riot, Hamel was able to land and take off from almost any open space. At each site local photographers produced sets of postcards depicting Hamel with his aircraft surrounded by the crowds, and the card sales proved extremely profitable.<br>
<br>Early in 1913 Miss Davies purchased her own two-seater Bl&eacute;riot and engaged Hamel as one of her aerial chauffeurs. He was extremely good-looking and debonair, and he possessed an engaging personality. To him flocked not only society's young ladies, but many of their mothers also. There was great competition to be photographed in his company and to obtain passenger flights at &pound;5 for a few minutes in the air. So many flew with him that he was called &#145;the society flyer&#146; and he was especially popular with people in the theatre, who discovered it was good publicity to be photographed in his company.<br>
<br>In April 1913 Hamel flew Frank Dupree, staff journalist on <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, to Cologne in four hours and fifteen minutes, and they were very well received by German officers. The departure from Dover had been kept secret from the rest of the press so that the flight preparations and take-off could be filmed. The flight was sponsored by <span class="italic">The Standard</span> and the imperial air fleet committee, with the intention of bringing to public notice Britain's need of a great imperial air fleet. The organizing committee felt that the Royal Navy's dreadnought programme overshadowed the country's lack of aircraft capable of military service in time of war. When Hamel arrived back at Charing Cross Station he was loudly cheered and carried shoulder high from the train to a motor car. The film was shown at the Scala Theatre. Hamel won the second aerial Derby in September 1913, coping in flight with a faulty petrol tap that vibrated loose and threw fuel over his face while he struggled to keep his finger over the leak for more than 30 miles.<br>
<br>By January 1914 a great new aviation stunt, &#145;looping the loop&#146;, had been brought to Britain by Adolphe Pegoud from France, and immediately it caught the public's attention. On 2 January Gladys Cooper (1888&#150;1971) was already strapped into Hamel's two-seater at Hendon and was about to be taken up for her first loop when Miss Davies, having learned that Hamel was to loop, rose from her sick-bed against doctor's orders, arrived at the aerodrome, and requested Miss Cooper to let her fly instead. Reluctantly she agreed, but was most disappointed on returning to London to see the evening papers proclaiming Miss Davies as the first woman to loop the loop. A special &#145;upside-down dinner&#146;, when all the courses were reversed, was held at the Royal Automobile Club to honour Hamel and the other looping exponent, B. C. Hucks. At the dinner Charles Coburn entertained guests by singing a verse of &#145;Two lovely black eyes&#146; while standing on his head. In early February 1914 Hamel was twice invited to lunch at Windsor Castle, and on the second occasion he performed fourteen loops. At the end of the month he flew to Worcester, being invited to join the countess of Dudley's house party at Witley Court, which included Lady Diana Manners. Hamel flew Lady Dudley over Worcester racecourse, performing a sequence of five loops. At Hendon on 12 March Hamel joined with Hucks in a display of looping and upside-down flying. Hamel's monoplane was painted jet black with large white circles on the tops of the wings, so that it could be clearly observed when the plane was inverted.<br>
<br>About this time Hamel took Marconi for several flights, during which they experimented with transmitting wireless messages on behalf of the naval and military authorities. Hamel's book, <span class="italic">Flying: some Practical Experiences</span>, co-written with the journalist and pilot C. C. Turner, was published in 1914. In May the same year Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, invited Hamel to be his guest on the Admiralty yacht <i>Enchantress</i>, off Sheerness. Churchill had been learning to fly with naval pilots since early in 1912, and acknowledged that Hamel was further ahead in the art of flying than any of the naval officers: &#145;If ever there was a man born to fly, three parts a bird and the rest genius, it was Hamel&#146;  (Churchill, 184). As well as demonstration flights for naval personnel, Hamel also took Churchill up in his plane.<br>
<br>Very early on the morning of Saturday 23 May 1914 Hamel set off from Villacoublay aerodrome near Paris to deliver a new racing Morane-Saulnier monoplane direct to Hendon, where he was to take part in the third aerial derby that afternoon. When he reached Hardelot weather conditions were still not favourable for the channel crossing. He set off for Hendon just after noon, but his plane crashed and he was drowned mid-channel. The race was abandoned because of bad weather and the shocking news that Hamel was missing in the channel. Extensive searches were made by the Royal Navy, but these were finally called off and the Admiralty issued its own special tribute to him. The manner of his death caused great distress, and the family received many condolences, including one from Buckingham Palace. Duff Cooper penned a poem &#145;In Memoriam&#146; and sent it to Lady Diana Manners; a slightly altered version was published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 29 May. Further poems and tributes appeared widely in the national press and in aeronautical and motor journals. A memorial service was held at the Grosvenor Chapel, London. French aviators paid tribute to him as &#145;le Garros anglais&#146;. Hamel was unmarried at the time of his death.<br>
