<span class="headword">Popham,  Alexander</span>  (1729&#150;1810), <span class="occ">politician and penal reformer</span>, the only son of Alexander Popham, rector of West Monckton, Somerset, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gatchell), was born on 18 July 1729. His family was closely allied to the Pophams of Littlecote, Wiltshire. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 11 November 1746 but migrated to All Souls, where he graduated BA in 1751 and MA in 1755. He was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1755, becoming a bencher of his inn in 1785, reader in 1793, and treasurer in 1800.<br>
<br>Popham was elected MP for Taunton in 1768. As chairman of quarter sessions he acquired an insight into the state of the county gaols, and during his first parliament an outbreak of fever killed eight out of nineteen prisoners at Taunton. On 17 February 1774 Popham brought forward a bill with a view to mitigating gaol distemper. It was framed in accordance with the disclosures and recommendations of John Howard, who, at Popham's instance, gave evidence before a committee of the House of Commons on 4 March 1774, and was afterwards called to the bar to receive the public thanks. Popham's bill was ultimately formed into two separate measures. The first of these abolished the fees demanded by gaolers from acquitted prisoners. The second provided for a more efficient control of the prisons by the magistrates: proper ventilation was to be provided, rooms were to be allotted for the immediate treatment and separation of the sick, arrangements were to be made for bathing, and, finally, a qualified, salaried surgeon or apothecary was to be appointed to each gaol, and to report to the justices at quarter sessions. The provisions of this last bill were very largely evaded, and little real progress was made until 1784, when the sale of alcoholic drinks in prisons by gaolers was prohibited, and gaolers were paid a fixed salary.<br>
<br>Unseated at the election of 1774, Popham was returned for Taunton on a petition in March 1775 but lost the election of 1780, only to return in 1784 and then hold his seat until 1796. In his early parliamentary career Popham had voted with the opposition, but came to support the Pitt administration in the 1780s and 1790s. In 1791 he introduced a poor-law amendment bill, a measure that many thought too radical and which was subsequently much amended.<br>
<br>Popham was married, although details are unknown, and had one daughter. He died at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 13 October 1810, and was buried in London at the Temple Church. Most of the &pound;80,000 he left in his will went to his grandson, Alexander Wadham Wyndham.<br>
