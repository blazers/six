<span class="headword">ffrench,  Charles Austin Thomas Robert John Joseph</span>, sixth Baron ffrench  (1868&#150;1955), <span class="occ">company director</span>, was born at Birchgrove, his maternal grandfather's house in co. Roscommon, on 20 June 1868, the elder son of the Hon. Martin Joseph ffrench (1813&#150;1893), of Frascati, Blackrock, Dublin, resident magistrate at Cashel in co. Tipperary (1846&#150;82), who succeeded his brother as fifth Baron ffrench in 1892; his mother was his father's second cousin, Catherine Mary Anne, daughter of John O'Shaughnessy. Two of his four sisters were nuns in teaching orders. The second baron had shot himself in 1814 following the failure of his ffrench Bank, and left his affairs so encumbered that his will was proved as late as 1915. Castle ffrench and the family's Galway land were alienated until the establishment of the Irish Free State, when they were repurchased by ffrench's sister-in-law, an admirer of Eamon de Valera and daughter of a Roman banker. The family was excluded from the Protestant ascendancy, and had no hope of employment in the Dublin Castle entourage; their Irish peerage did not carry a seat in the House of Lords. Charlie ffrench, whose paternal grandfather raised funds for the Catholic emancipation campaigns of Daniel O'Connell, inherited his title in 1893.<br>
<br>ffrench was educated at Clongowes Wood College, co. Kildare, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied philosophy and found a lifelong interest in the existential ideas of Kierkegaard. In 1892 he married Mary Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of Matthew James Corbally, of Rathbeal Hall, Swords, near Dublin; she was tubercular, as a result of which their only child, an infant son, died in 1894. ffrench also later contracted tuberculosis. To improve his wife's health he settled at Graaff-Reinet in Cape Colony before moving to Johannesburg around 1896. His friendship with Roger Casement, with whose Irish nationalism he discreetly sympathized, dates from this time. He was also in the set that promoted the Jameson raid.<br>
<br>In Rhodesia, ffrench met the former minister of mines and public works, George Pauling, who was in partnership with Rutherfoord Harris, formerly confidential agent of Cecil Rhodes. Pauling and Harris appointed ffrench as their agent in China, and from 1907 he struggled to negotiate railway-building contracts for them. The projects with which he was chiefly concerned were the Fakumen Railway in Manchuria (1907&#150;8), the Canton (Guangzhou)&#150;Hankow (Hankou) line (1908&#150;9), the Chinchow (Jinzhou)&#150;Aigun (1909&#150;11), the Canton&#150;Chungking (Chongqing)&#150;Lanchow (Lanzhou) (1911&#150;12), and the Yangtze (Yangzi)&#150;Singyifu (1913&#150;14). These schemes were all thwarted, either by Russian or Japanese animosity, or because of the exclusive British diplomatic support given in China to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. ffrench spent part of 1915&#150;16 in Russia where Pauling was building a railway from the ice-free port of Murmansk. The Russian authorities proved as frustrating as the Chinese. These reverses contributed to his pessimistic, sardonic outlook.<br>
<br>From 1918 until 1924 ffrench was chairman of a newly formed issuing house, British Stockbrokers Trust. BST represented a revolt by brokers from the great industrial areas of Britain who had long resented the way in which new capital issues were offered to them for subscription by London brokers. The trust formed subsidiary companies in five main catchment areas for provincial investment. Industrial issues became a less exclusive and metropolitan activity as a result of its success.<br>
<br>ffrench also accepted directorships from British Oxygen and other companies. As a result of financial reverses in the 1930s, he gave up his house in Kensington and returned to Dublin, living first with his sisters in Upper Leeson Street, afterwards at Rathbeal Hall, Swords, with his wife's sister-in-law Lady Mary Corbally, and latterly in a hotel suite at D&uacute;n Laoghaire. After his first wife's death in 1944, he married second, in 1951, Catherine Elizabeth, always known as Kay (<i>d</i>. 1960), fifth daughter of Sir Christopher Nixon, first baronet, a Dublin physician. Both his wives were highly strung and neither matched his intelligence. He died of heart failure in St Michael's Hospital at D&uacute;n Laoghaire, co. Dublin, on 4 March 1955 and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>ffrench had a cadaverous but imposing appearance, being very tall with a long, narrow nose and a goatee beard. He was a dedicated Roman Catholic who was sure of his opinions and cared little for those of others; the phrase with which he terminated a theological discussion, that he could not argue, but only instruct, was characteristically peremptory. He epitomized the mixture of intelligence and abstracted eccentricity meant by the Irish sobriquet, &#145;a queer hawk&#146;. Contemporaries were more impressed by ffrench's energy and title than by his acumen for business. An archetype of landless Irish nobility, his activities in China and elsewhere made him a significant player in the great game of financial imperialism.<br>
