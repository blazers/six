<span class="headword">White,  Eric  Milner-</span>  (1884&#150;1963), <span class="occ">dean of York</span>, was born on 23 April 1884 at Langholm, The Avenue, Southampton, the eldest son and first child of Henry Milner-White, barrister and chairman of Edwin Jones &amp; Co. of Southhampton, and his wife, Kathleen Lucy Meeres. From Harrow School, Milner-White went up to King's College, Cambridge, in 1903 to read history, and was awarded first-class honours in both parts of the historical tripos in 1905 and 1907. In 1906 he was the university's Lightfoot scholar. Following a year at Cuddesdon Theological College in 1907 Milner-White was ordained deacon in 1908 and priest in 1909 at Southwark. He served as curate at St Paul's, Newington, from 1908 to 1909 and St Mary Magdalene, Woolwich, from 1909 to 1912, when he was appointed chaplain of King's College, Cambridge, and lecturer in history at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>During the First World War Milner-White was chaplain to the forces at the western front and in Italy and was awarded the DSO for his service as senior chaplain and combatant officer in the 7th division in 1917. As army chaplain he contributed an essay, &#145;Worship and services&#146;, to <span class="italic">The Church in the Furnace</span> (1918); this reflected his belief that the ministry of army chaplains provided by the established church did not meet the needs of the troops in the trenches. In 1918 he was appointed fellow and dean of King's College, Cambridge. Milner-White enjoyed the freedom to experiment in order to find liturgical forms suitable for the particular context of King's College. In memory of those who had fallen in the war, and of his own delivery from death when under fire as an army chaplain, Milner-White transformed one of the side chapels of King's College chapel into a memorial chapel. In 1918 he instituted the annual service of nine lessons and carols, building on a form devised by G. H. S. Walpole in 1880 at Truro Cathedral, and this was first broadcast by the BBC in 1928. The service has been transmitted annually by the BBC (with the exception of 1930) ever since, and rapidly became a major national event. By the early 1930s the BBC was also broadcasting the service on overseas programmes. In 1934 Milner-White introduced the processional Advent carol service at King's College chapel. He was a founder member of the Oratory of the Good Shepherd and its superior from 1923 to 1938; from 1936 to 1941 he was a canon of Lincoln Cathedral. In 1937 he published a novel, <span class="italic">The Book of Hugh and Nancy</span>, originating in his experiences at summer camps with King's College choristers.<br>
<br>In 1941 the archbishop of York, William Temple, installed Milner-White as dean of York. He took a great interest in education and in Anglo-Catholic public schools in particular. In 1945 he became provost of the northern division of the Woodard Corporation. He was a patron of the arts with a strong interest in restoring and preserving the stained glass both in King's College chapel and in York Minster. Milner-White regarded stained glass as one of the chief media of teaching for the church. In 1948 he was made an honorary member of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers with freedom of the City of London. From 1944 to 1959 Milner-White was a member of the advisory council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was one of two vice-chairmen of the Advisory Council for the Care of Churches. He owned a large collection of modern ceramics, much of which he donated to Southampton Art Gallery, the City of York Art Gallery, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. As dean of York, Milner-White established the Borthwick Institute of Historical Research and the York Institute of Architectural Study. He enlarged the minster library and created a library endowment to ensure that it kept up with new publications. From 1948 to 1962 he was on the literary panel of the committee that produced the <span class="roman">New English Bible</span>. Milner-White was awarded a Lambeth DD in 1952 and made an honorary doctor of letters by the University of Leeds in 1962. In 1952 he was also awarded a CBE. A founder member of York Civic Trust, Milner-White was also involved with the founding of the University of York.<br>
<br>As dean Milner-White devised a number of services for special occasions in York Minster, such as an improved service for the enthronement of new archbishops and the wedding of the duke of Kent. He was a member of the liturgical commission of the Church of England from 1955 to 1962 and chairman of the commission on the recognition of saints. He published several liturgical source books, building on his experience of creating liturgies for regular and special occasions. These include <span class="italic">Memorials upon Several Occasions: Prayers and Thanksgivings for Use in Public Worship</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">My God, my Glory: Aspirations, Acts and Prayers on the Desire for God</span> (1954). The aim of liturgy, he wrote:<blockquote>is not to evoke the interest of the passer-by, but to achieve a common prayer before God of which the worshipping Church cannot tire &hellip; Thus gradually, inevitably the quality of prayer rises; its range widens; and liturgy continues to make its silent and immense contribution to the fullest worship of God, and thereby to the movement, along the deepest channels of all, to Christian unity. (Milner-White, 760&#150;62)</blockquote>Eric Milner-White died of cancer on 15 June 1963 at the deanery, York, and was cremated. His ashes were interred in York Minster. He never married.<br>
