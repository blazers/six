<span class="headword">Wright,  Charles Henry Hamilton</span>  (1836&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Hebraist and theologian</span>, was born at Dublin on 9 March 1836, the second son of the ten children of Edward Wright, barrister of Floraville, Donnybrook, co. Dublin, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Joseph Wright of Beech Hill, Donnybrook. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37035/', "Edward Perceval Wright")</script> was his eldest brother. Wright was educated privately, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 July 1852. As an undergraduate he actively engaged in religious controversy and propaganda for the protestant side, and in 1853 he wrote his first work, <span class="italic">Coming Events, or, Glimpses of the Future</span>, as well as an anonymous attack on Roman Catholicism, <span class="italic">The Pope the Antichrist</span>. He became interested for a time in Celtic philology, publishing <span class="italic">A Grammar of the Modern Irish Language</span> (1855), but soon turned to theology and oriental languages, which remained his lifelong interest. In 1856 he won the primate's Hebrew premium, and he graduated BA with a first class in the divinity testimonium examination in 1857. He was awarded the Arabic prize in 1859, and proceeded MA in the same year, BD in 1873, and DD in 1879. He became PhD at Leipzig in 1875.<br>
<br>Wright was ordained to the curacy of Middleton-Tyas, Yorkshire, in 1859, but though an earnest preacher he was unsuited to ordinary parochial work. On 23 June 1859 he married Ebba Johanna Dorothea, daughter of Professor Nils Wilhelm Almroth, governor of the royal mint in Stockholm. They had at least five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37032/', "Sir Almroth Edward Wright (1861&#150;1947)")</script>, pathologist; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37034/', "Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright (1862&#150;1940)")</script>, librarian; and Eric Blackwood Wright (1860&#150;1940), colonial judge. He was appointed in 1863 to the English chaplaincy at Dresden, where he became acquainted with F. J. Delitzsch and other German biblical scholars and became a member of the German Oriental Society. His trenchant protestantism made him popular with some of the English residents but it offended members of the high-church party, who successfully petitioned A. C. Tait, bishop of London, to appoint an additional chaplain. In 1868 Wright became chaplain of Trinity Church at Boulogne in France, where he served not only British seamen but also German prisoners of the Franco-Prussian War, 1870&#150;71. Thanks to his efforts the English church was repaired.<br>
<br>After returning to Ireland, Wright served successively as incumbent of St Mary's, Belfast (1874&#150;85), and of Bethesda Church, Dublin (1885&#150;91). In 1891 he accepted the benefice of St John's, Liverpool; he retired in 1898. In 1878 Wright was elected Bampton lecturer; his lectures &#145;Zechariah and his prophecies&#146; were published in 1879. In Dublin in 1880&#150;81 he delivered the Donellan lectures, entitled &#145;The book of Ecclesiastes in relation to modern criticism&#146;; these were published in 1883. He was also Grinfield lecturer in Oxford, on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, in 1893, and also from 1895 to 1897. In addition he acted as examiner in Hebrew for the universities of Oxford, London, Manchester, and Wales.<br>
<br>One of the last great militant protestants, Wright devoted himself with conspicuous ability to the cause of the Protestant Reformation Society, of which he was clerical superintendent from 1898 to 1907. His prolific writings against Roman Catholicism were published in pamphlet form and also in <span class="italic">A Protestant Dictionary</span> (1904), of which he was joint editor. While his abilities were recognized even by his opponents, his personality created barriers. He was never rewarded with a more leisured clerical office and died at his London house, 90 Bolingbroke Grove, Wandsworth Common, on 22 March 1909.<br>
<br>Wright's numerous biblical works included several Hebrew texts of books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, with notes, and some exegetical studies. His theology was mainly conservative, though he could accept an allegorical rather than a critical reading of the text at some points. His biblical works were not widely read. After his death a tablet was erected in St Mary's Church, Dublin, which described him, <i>inter alia</i>, as &#145;a knight of the North Star of Sweden&#146;.<br>
