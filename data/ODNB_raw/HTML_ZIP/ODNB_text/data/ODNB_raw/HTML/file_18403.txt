<span class="headword">Maxwell,  John</span>, fourth Lord Herries of Terregles  (<em>c.</em>1512&#150;1583), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born in Dumfriesshire, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18410/', "Robert Maxwell, fifth Lord Maxwell (c.1494&#150;1546)")</script>, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Drumlanrig. The Maxwells were one of the most powerful border families, and normally provided the wardens of the Scottish west march. Through ties of kinship and marriage, and also through bonds of manrent, they had created a sphere of influence which included the baronies of Caerlaverock and Granane, the hereditary stewardships of Annandale and Kirkcudbright, and the ecclesiastical lordships of Dundrennan, Tongland, Sweetheart, and Holywood abbeys. Their jurisdiction as wardens extended not only over the sheriffdom of Dumfries and the two stewardships but also over some parts of the sheriffdom of Wigtown.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1546 John Maxwell succeeded him as warden. He immediately came under conflicting pressures from the government of the earl of Arran, the Scottish regent, and from English officials, led by Thomas, Lord Wharton, who were endeavouring to bring the Scottish borders under their own control. Wharton was anxious to secure the Maxwell strongholds of Lochmaben and Caerlaverock, and he also looked for Maxwell's support against the powerful Douglas family, led by the earl of Angus. But he found that though Maxwell was prepared to accept an English pension, he could not be trusted to carry out the undertakings which justified its payment. In February 1548 an English expedition up Nithsdale was severely mauled near Drumlanrig, leading to suspicions that Maxwell had changed sides and warned Angus of Wharton's plans. The English warden responded by hanging a number of Scottish hostages.<br>
<br>Maxwell may well have been influenced in his manoeuvrings at this point by the offer made to him by Arran of the hand in marriage of his ward Agnes (<i>c</i>.1534&#150;1594), eldest daughter of William, third Lord Herries. The marriage took place in March 1548 and produced twelve children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18412/', "William Maxwell of Terregles")</script>, who succeeded as fifth Lord Herries, Robert, Edward, James, and John; and Elizabeth, Margaret, Agnes, Mary, Sarah, Grizel, and Nicola. Maxwell's courtesy right under Scottish custom to represent his wife's peerage was recognized only in December 1566, when he finally came into complete possession of the territorial barony of Herries, having purchased the lands and eliminated the claims which the Hamiltons had acquired from his wife's sisters.<br>
<br>Maxwell's casting in his lot with Arran led to his remaining march warden until March 1550. He held that office again several times, with short terms in 1552&#150;3 and 1554&#150;5; after his reappointment in 1557, at a time of great confusion (for much of 1559 the wardenship was unoccupied), he finally secured in 1560 an appointment which lasted until at least October 1567. The warden's office was a difficult and sometimes dangerous one, and came to be rewarded accordingly. In 1552 Maxwell became the first official to receive a supplement of &pound;500 to his basic annual salary of &pound;100. His being appointed several times as a border commissioner for negotiations with his English counterparts, together with a short spell as keeper of Liddesdale in 1554, indicates that his services were appreciated by both his own and the English governments. Indeed, when he returned briefly to office in 1579, Queen Elizabeth, informed by Lord Scrope of his endeavours, personally congratulated him on &#145;the administrations of justice and repairing and punishing on his side the disorders of those that seek to disturb the peace between England and Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 335). Earlier that year Maxwell, now Lord Herries, had presented a programme for administrative reform of the borders to Morton and his council. Its proposals included the suggestion that an armed force should be permanently based in the region, and the recommendation that the wardens should be assisted in their duties by representatives of the principal families within each march. This inevitably implied that the Maxwells would have to co-operate with the Johnstones, their great rivals in the west, and in January 1579, in acknowledgement that Herries was at least prepared to contemplate such a situation, Morton dismissed the existing warden, Lord Maxwell, and replaced him with his uncle. But the appointment was short-lived, for Herries was superseded by John Johnstone of that ilk in August, having presumably found that his advancing years made him unsuitable for such a demanding job.<br>
<br>Maxwell's loyalty to the Marian cause was an important aspect of his later career. This allegiance, like that of many other noblemen, flourished despite his own preference for the reformed religion, which in 1559 had resulted in his being incarcerated in Edinburgh Castle. Following his release he was a signatory of the treaty of Berwick, whereby English aid was forthcoming for the beleaguered lords of the congregation. Later in 1560 he subscribed to the first <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>. Maxwell was highly regarded by John Knox at this time; even when Maxwell began to display his Marian sympathies, Knox could still refer to him as &#145;a man stout and wittie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.459) and of &#145;great judgment and experience&#146;  (ibid., 2.351).<br>
<br>At the time of the chaseabout raid in 1565, Maxwell attempted to mediate between the earl of Moray and the queen, and when his efforts failed he encouraged Moray to retreat to England. Following Mary's enforced abdication his position was at first ambivalent. Initially he was prominent as the outstanding representative of the queen's party, and the English ambassador Sir Nicholas Throckmorton referred to him as &#145;the cunning horse-leech and the wisest of the whole faction; but, as the Queen of Scots says of him, there is nobody can be sure of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1566&#150;8</i>, 324). This equivocal judgement must have seemed justified when in December 1567 Herries spoke out in favour of those who, following Mary's refusal to separate from Bothwell, had imprisoned her at Lochleven, and let it be known that he had allied himself to the party of the infant James VI. But soon afterwards he emerged as one of the queen's staunchest supporters. On 13 May 1568, following the queen's escape from Lochleven, Herries commanded Mary's cavalry at the battle of Langside where, despite being numerically superior, the Marian forces were decisively defeated. Subsequently Herries emerged as the key figure in the events surrounding Mary's flight into exile. While the queen rested at Terregles he contacted the English commander in Carlisle for permission for the refugees to enter England, while Mary's last night in Scotland was spent at Dundrennan Abbey, where one of Herries's sons was commendator. On 16 May Herries and a few other loyal followers accompanied Mary across the Solway Firth to Workington, where she placed herself at the mercy of Queen Elizabeth. The latter, concerned about Mary's presence in England but reluctant to appear to be sanctioning her overthrow in Scotland, conceived the idea of an Anglo-Scottish conference to discuss the possibility of restoring the Scottish queen. Not surprisingly, when Mary's supporters assembled shortly afterwards at Dumbarton, Herries was nominated to be one of her representatives at the forthcoming conference.<br>
<br>When the enquiry got under way at York in October 1568, the two main spokesmen for the Marian cause were Herries and John Lesley, bishop of Ross. Similarly when the proceedings were moved to Hampton Court in December it was principally Herries and Lesley who acted in defence of the queen against the allegations presented by the earl of Moray, leader of the king's party. But despite their efforts Elizabeth delivered a judgment in January 1569 which, though ambiguously phrased, meant in effect that Mary remained a prisoner in England. In the civil war between the king's and queen's factions which broke out in 1570 and lasted until May 1573, Herries, like so many of Mary's allies, was initially very active on her behalf, so much so that he was arrested by Moray's government in April 1569 and confined within Edinburgh Castle, where he remained until after the regent's assassination on 23 January 1570. In April of that year he joined such other leading Marians as the earls of Huntly, Argyll, and Atholl, when they gathered in Edinburgh, and he attended the parliament which they held in the capital two months later. One repercussion of their activities, and also of their sheltering English refugees from the northern risings of 1569&#150;70, was that the king's party gave its approval to a retaliatory raid in the summer of 1570 by the earl of Sussex on the properties of Herries and other border families.<br>
<br>By 1571, however, Herries was becoming less involved in the Marian cause, though he continued to contact Elizabeth's government regarding the possibility of Mary's restoration, and warned the English queen that if she failed to adopt a more positive line he and his associates might look overseas for assistance. A year later he had recognized the inevitable; and while he was not himself present when Morton was elected regent, in November 1572, his son William, master of Herries, was. Shortly afterwards Morton's government repealed a number of statutes directed against Herries and his fellow Marians. Throughout Morton's regency Herries generally kept a low profile, and it was only when Morton lost office in 1578 that he reappeared on the scene. He was a member of the Argyll&#150;Atholl faction which forced the regent's resignation, being one of those who demanded the surrender of Edinburgh Castle. Herries became a privy councillor in the short-lived administration which replaced Morton, and was also a commissioner representing the new government in talks with the church over proposed reforms. The latter appointment was made despite his having been cited for non-payment of his thirds of benefices and his also being in receipt of a comfortable pension from the bishopric of Galloway. Following Morton's return to power in the summer of 1578, Herries was one of eight nobles nominated on 8 September to assist the king in working towards &#145;the repose and quietness of the troubled commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 26).<br>
<br>In 1581, unlike his nephew Lord Maxwell, who was a member of the jury which sentenced Morton to death, Herries took little part in the events which led to the ex-regent's execution. But he was a leading supporter of the duke of Lennox's faction, which briefly controlled Scottish affairs in the early 1580s, and, following the Ruthven raid of August 1582 which effectively ended the Lennox regime, he was a member of the delegation to James VI which sought (unsuccessfully) a meeting between the king and the fallen duke. It was one of his last recorded actions. Herries died in Edinburgh on Sunday, 20 January 1583, in &#145;an upper chamber of William Fowler's lodging&#146;, where, feeling too unwell to attend the afternoon's sermon, he had gone &#145;to see the boys bicker&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.232). He was buried in Terregles church. The house in which he died had once belonged to a prominent Edinburgh councillor who had also been a supporter of Queen Mary. His widow died at Terregles on 14 March 1594, and in her will asked to be buried beside her late husband.<br>
<br>Herries was the author of a text published in 1836, from a seventeenth-century abridgement, as <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of the Reign of Mary Queen of Scots, and a Portion of the Reign of King James the Sixth</span>. Covering the years 1542 to 1571, it is a work of considerable value, despite its Marian perspective, as one of the comparatively few contemporary accounts of this period. But although his writings assure Herries of a niche in Scottish historiography, there is no doubt that his greatest importance lay in his activities as an administrator of the borders, where he faithfully served both Mary of Guise and Mary, queen of Scots, for more than twenty years. Even his opponent the earl of Morton recognized his talents in that capacity, for not only did Morton in 1579 adopt many of the proposals put forward by Herries for the reform of border government, but he also gave him a final stint as march warden, when he was in his late sixties.<br>
