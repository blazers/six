<span class="headword">Manton,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1766&#150;1835), <span class="occ">gun maker</span>, was born in April 1766 and baptized on 29 April at St Wulfram's Church, Grantham, Lincolnshire, the youngest of six children of John Manton (1725&#150;1802), farmer, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Henry Gildon, yeoman, and his wife, Ann. He was apprenticed first to William Newton of Grantham and then to his elder brother, John Manton, at 6 Dover Street, London. He married Mary Ann Aitkens on 17 January 1792. They had nine children; of these, Frederick was sent out to India in 1822 where he established a gun making business in Calcutta, and Charles became master furbisher at the Tower of London in 1829. In 1789 Joseph Manton branched out on his own and by 1791 he was established in business at 25 Davies Street, Berkeley Square, London, where he remained until 1818. The possession of one of his guns was an object of ambition to sportsmen, many of whom frequented his shop. Colonel Peter Hawker was a great friend and admirer of Joe Manton, as he was almost universally called, and his <span class="italic">Instructions to Young Sportsmen</span> abounds with references to Manton's skill.<br>
<br>Manton took out twelve patents between 1792 and 1825 for a variety of ideas. These included an improved hammer and breeching; a spring to prevent the trigger from rattling; cartridges; a perforated hammer to allow air to escape when the charge was being rammed down; the &#145;elevated rib&#146; connecting the barrels of double guns; the &#145;gravitating stop&#146; to prevent accidental discharge; and the &#145;musical sear&#146;, by which a musical sound was produced on cocking the piece. Manton applied for a patent in 1790 for a machine for rifling cannon, and for an improved shot with a base of soft wood to take into the grooving. Experiments were carried out at Woolwich and he was offered a sum of &pound;500 for these inventions, which he declined. Finally in 1792 the patent was granted. Had he co-operated more closely with the authorities, Manton would have met with more success but he had already developed those characteristics of doggedness and determination which were to colour his whole life. In his best guns he introduced platinum touch-holes for preventing corrosion, and his barrels were proved by hydraulic pressure. He claimed that none of his guns had ever been known to burst. His famous reputation as the &#145;king of the gun makers&#146; was founded on the speed of ignition of his flintlocks and the overall excellence of his work. His other inventions comprised a method of enclosing clocks in exhausted cases to make them airless; airtight sliding tubes for telescopes; and a tool for boring holes in horses' feet, so that shoes might be attached by screws instead of by nails. Hawker claimed for Manton the introduction of the copper percussion cap, but this is not borne out by the evidence.<br>
<br>In 1816 Manton started to make guns with percussion ignition, first with a pellet lock and in 1818 with a tube lock. The quality was superb but they were very costly, and whereas in 1815 he had an annual production of 400 arms, by 1825 the figure was less than 100. Several legal actions for alleged infringements of his patents, one against his own brother John, were also a great expense and in 1825 he was imprisoned for debt. He was declared bankrupt in January 1826. He had recovered by June 1827, but was again imprisoned four times between 1828 and 1831. At the time of his bankruptcy he was carrying on business at 11 Hanover Square and at 315 Oxford Street but the next year he was in the New Road, Marylebone, then in Burwood Place, and in 1834 at 6 Holles Street, in partnership with his son John Augustus. Manton died at 4 Lyon Terrace, Edgware Road, Maida Hill, on 29 June 1835, aged sixty-nine, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, his epitaph being from the pen of Colonel Hawker, who printed it in his <span class="italic">Instructions</span>. Manton's business was carried on by his son at 6 Holles Street until 1838, when it was acquired by Messrs Charles and Henry Egg, also a name of repute in the gun trade. His brother <a name="cosubject_18007"></a><span class="headword">John Manton</span>  (1752&#150;1834) was also a <span class="occ">gun maker</span>, with a reputation little inferior to that of Joseph. He was born on 6 November 1752 at Grantham, the eldest son of John Manton (1725&#150;1802) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gildon. He was apprenticed in 1766 to John Dixon, gun maker, at Leicester, turned over in 1768 to W. Edson at Grantham, and from about 1774 worked for John Twigg of Piccadilly, rising to be his foreman. He and his wife, Catherine, whom he married about 1786, had four children. At Michaelmas 1781 he set up on his own at 6 Dover Street, Piccadilly, where he carried on business until his death. Between 1797 and 1821 he developed a flintlock with a V-shaped flash pan which was very successful, a single trigger action, a vertical sear, and a new breech system, all protected by patents. His business prospered despite a temporary set back in 1823&#150;4 when he continued with flint ignition while other makers were using percussion locks. Eventually he yielded to the increasing knowledge of the times and thereafter his trade recovered.<br>
<br>In 1814 John Manton took his son George Henry into partnership and the firm was known as John Manton &amp; Son. Shortly afterwards annual production was about 250 arms and Colonel Hawker gave this opinion: &#145;No one can dispute the excellence of Mr John Manton's guns, although he may have left to other members the risk or merit of trying experiments, and bringing out new patents or inventions.&#146; John Manton died at 6 Dover Street on 24 November 1834 and was buried at St George's, Hanover Square, bequeathing the whole of his business to his son George Henry.<br>
