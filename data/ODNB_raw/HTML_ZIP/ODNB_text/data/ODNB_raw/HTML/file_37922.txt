<span class="headword">Rudyerd,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1703&#150;1709), <span class="occ">builder of the second Eddystone lighthouse</span>, was one of a large and poor family. Little is known of his origins, except that he was born in Cornwall, probably near Plymouth. There he was in the service of a gentleman, who caused him to be educated.<br>
<br>In the early eighteenth century Rudyerd was in business as a silk mercer in Ludgate Hill, London, when he was engaged by Captain John Lovel or Lovet, the lessee, to act as &#145;architect and surveyor&#146; for a lighthouse on the Eddystone Reef near Plymouth, to replace the one built by Henry Winstanley, which had been swept away by a storm in 1703 after only five years. Assisted by Norcott and Smith, Woolwich shipwrights, he carried out a tremendous feat of engineering. Using a shore base at Empacombe, he first anchored his structure to the rocks in a novel and successful way. Then, using layers of oak balks between much thicker layers of granite to give mass for stability, he built the tower round a central timber mast, to a height of 61 feet. The whole was encased in heavy oak timbers, caulked and pitch-covered like a ship, to a total height of 92 feet.<br>
<br>The light, which had twenty-four candles, was first shown on 28 July 1708, and the lighthouse was completed in 1709. It stood successfully in its very exposed position until December 1755; it was then totally destroyed by fire, which started in the lantern roof and, despite the efforts of the keepers, spread down through the timbers, driving the men out upon the rocks, whence they were rescued next day.<br>
<br>John Smeaton expressed the greatest admiration for Rudyerd's work, which greatly benefited him when he built the third Eddystone light. Rudyerd was the builder of the first successful sea-rock lighthouse in the world, but nothing more is known of him. Smeaton presumed that he died soon after completion of the work.<br>
