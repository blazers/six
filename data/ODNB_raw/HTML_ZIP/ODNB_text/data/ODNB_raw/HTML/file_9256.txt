<span class="headword">Fell,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1674<span class="mult">x</span>80), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary</span>, was from Lancashire but his parents are unknown; he had a brother, Thomas. His surname was common in Lancashire and it has not been possible to establish his kinship (if any) with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9262/', "Thomas Fell")</script>, judge, of Swarthmoor Hall near Ulverston, and his wife, the Quaker pioneer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9260/', "Margaret Fell, n&#233;e Askew")</script>. Nevertheless, he clearly did have strong social ties with them, and was apparently Thomas's clerk. He probably became a Quaker when George Fox visited the Swarthmoor area in 1652. In 1653 he wrote, but did not publish, &#145;The standard of the Lord lifted against the Beast &hellip; or, An answer to a booke entitled <i>A Looking-Glasse for George Fox</i>&#146;.<br>
<br>By March 1655, when he held a meeting at Gravesend, Kent, Fell was travelling in the ministry. On 20 August 1656 he sailed from Bristol to the West Indies, arriving on Barbados on 7 October. There he held many meetings and experienced some difficulties with the Ranter Joseph Salmon. In late July 1657 he left the island. When the ship was approaching England it was captured by the Spanish and Fell was taken prisoner to Spain. He succeeded in escaping and reached London on 29 October 1657. In September 1658 he returned to Barbados, and from there went to Surinam, where he performed some service among the settlers and Indians. Arrested by the authorities, he was shipped back to Barbados in May 1659.<br>
<br>By October 1659 Fell was back in London. He was seriously ill-treated by some soldiers near Westminster Hall, and on 21 May 1660 he was imprisoned at Thetford and whipped as a vagrant a week later. The pass for conveying him back to Ulverston provides a brief description: &#145;a very suspitious Jesuited deluder &amp; one who denyeth the Oath of Allegeance &amp; Supremasy, a man of midle statur of some thirty yeares of age, with brown Curled haire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Short Journal</span>, xxi). Fell was rearrested when he returned to the town and preached again. He was released on 1 August 1660 and spent the rest of the year ministering in London, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Essex. He was in London in early January 1661 when he was caught up as an innocent bystander in Thomas Venner's Fifth-Monarchist rising and beaten up by soldiers as he was making his way to a Quaker meeting (Fox says that he would have been killed if the duke of York had not intervened). Fell was one of the twelve signatories to the important <span class="italic">Declaration &hellip; Against All Plotters and Fighters in the World</span>, issued on 21 January 1661, by which the Quakers disavowed the use of violence to achieve their ends.<br>
<br>In May 1661 Fell embarked with John Stubbs on a voyage to Egypt; their ultimate destinations were the country of the legendary Prester John (to whom before their departure they produced an address in Latin and English: <span class="italic">For Presbyter John and all his subordinate kings and princes, from the people of God in England &hellip; called Quakers</span>) and China. They set out on their journey with Richard Scosthrop and Daniel Baker. As no shipmaster would carry them, the Quakers got a warrant from the king, which the East India Company found means to avoid. They then went to the Netherlands and from there proceeded to Leghorn, and thence to Alexandria. The English consul banished them from the place as trouble-makers. &#145;The Quakers&#146;, he explained, &#145;did throw Pamphlets about the Streets in Hebrew, Arabick, and Latin, and if they had staid a little longer, it might have set them a burning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.469). They were compelled to return to England, travelling from Leghorn to Heidelberg, where they met their fellow Quaker William Caton, with whom they visited the elector palatine, Charles Louis.<br>
<br>Fell probably spent 1662&#150;4 at Swarthmoor Hall as scribe for Fox's &#145;Short journal&#146;. By 1665 he was back in Barbados, married and planning to leave for New York. He then had severe business problems, and was undergoing a period of spiritual crisis. His financial problems continued, and his last surviving letter, written from Barbados to Margaret Fell in March 1674, while it attested to his renewed faith also reported that his wife and child were planning to return to Bristol, but that he was a virtually a prisoner for his debts. He was dead by 1680, when his name appears on a list of deceased Friends. He died either in Barbados or North America.<br>
