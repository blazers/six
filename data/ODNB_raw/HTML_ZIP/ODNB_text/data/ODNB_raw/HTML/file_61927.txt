<span class="headword">Rees,  Thomas Percy</span>  (1899&#150;1963), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born in Bwlch, Carmarthenshire, on 16 March 1899, the son of Thomas Rees, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies, also from a farming family. After leaving school he served in the machine-gun corps during the First World War. He was then a medical student at the Welsh National School of Medicine, followed by clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He obtained the conjoint qualification in 1923 and graduated MB in the University of Wales two years later, having previously taken a BSc. He obtained the MRCP in 1926.<br>
<br>Rees first intended to undertake academic research in psychiatry,but instead he decided upon mental hospital work. From Napsbury Hospital he went in 1927 to Croydon Borough Mental Hospital (later Warlingham Park Hospital) as deputy physician superintendent. In 1935 he became superintendent, and his first act was to throw open the iron gates at the hospital entrance, after which they were never shut again. Over the next few years all ward doors were unlocked during the day, while nearly all restraint and isolation of patients were abolished.<blockquote>For Rees, however, the &#145;open door&#146; policy did not consist in a mere unlocking of doors; it implied a general attitude of enthusiasm, activism, fresh-mindedness, permissiveness and general friendliness, which exerted their beneficient effects not only in his own institution but in widening circles both in his own country and elsewhere. (MacKeith, 311)</blockquote>Among psychiatrists in other hospitals there was then a good deal of doubt that such a policy could be safe&#151;even frank incredulity that the ward doors were really unlocked. However:<blockquote>He would recall how, when he first went to the hospital, a long row of actively suicidal patients sat unemployed all day long behind a heavy table in the refractory ward with a male nurse at either end. This sight seems to have made a deep impression on him. (ibid.)</blockquote>Some of the male nursing staff were resistant to his innovations, and Rees did not hesitate to dismiss some on that account. Patients then had greater freedom of movement than was usual in mental hospitals of the time. According to E. H. Hare:<blockquote>Although he was inclined to attribute the origins of the new enlightenment in mental hospitals to the introduction of a useful treatment for general paralysis of the insane, Rees had little faith in the efficacy of physical treatment for most mental illness. Patients come to mental hospitals, he used to say, to learn to live with other people. (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1331)</blockquote>Yet he gave freedom to his medical staff to pursue their clinical interests, and pioneering work was done at Warlingham Park with insulin coma therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, prefrontal leucotomy, and the treatment of alcoholism; the first specialized alcoholism unit in Britain was established there by Dr Max Glatt in 1953. Rees also became consultant psychiatrist to Croydon General Hospital and the Croydon Child Guidance Clinic. In 1939 he was a member of the Feversham committee on voluntary mental health organizations, and subsequently became consultant to the National Association for Mental Health and to the London Marriage Guidance Council. He devoted much effort to health education, among both his hospital staff and people of all kinds in the community&#151;in Croydon and more widely&#151;being especially skilful in explaining psychiatric problems to lay people.<br>
<br>Following the inauguration of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948 Rees became a member of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and was appointed OBE in 1949. He was adviser in mental health to the World Health Organization, and in that capacity was a member of an expert committee which produced an influential report on the future of psychiatric hospitals in 1953. It was said that the ideal hospital described there was actually an account of Warlingham Park. This report was fairly negative on the relationship of psychiatry to general hospitals&#151;a view which Rees held fairly strongly himself. This emerged in &#145;Back to moral treatment and community care&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span>, 1956), the published version of his presidential address to the Royal Medico-Psychological Association and one of the very few papers that he wrote. Nor did he participate in systematic research.<br>
<br>One of Rees's most significant activities was membership of the royal commission on the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency, 1954&#150;7. Its report was largely embodied in the <span class="roman">Mental Health Act</span> of 1959, which revolutionized the legal and administrative basis of mental health care; it also provided an ideology of moving the emphasis of treatment and care into the community&#151;a process which remained slow and uneven due to financial limitations. Rees provided the main psychiatric influence within the commission.<br>
<br>In 1956, the year of his presidency of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association, Rees retired from the NHS and entered private practice in Harley Street. Congratulating him on his presidential address Dr Tom Main said that:<blockquote>whilst his work was based on the solid foundations of all that was best in past traditions of mental hospital work, he had not been content merely to follow established custom, but had made his own personal contribution by adventurously adopting the concept of the hospital as a therapeutic community. (<span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span>, 24)</blockquote>In the same year the county borough of Croydon acknowledged his service to the local community by awarding him the freedom of the borough, and the Royal College of Physicians made him a fellow (thirty years after his membership).<br>
<br>T. P., as he was universally known (distinguishing him from both J. R. and Linford Rees, who were equally well-known psychiatrists of the time), had a Welsh fluency of speech and conversational wit. He also had great energy and a personality which tended to dominate any group in which he was a member. He was acknowledged to be a highly influential figure in mental health care, but this influence was almost wholly administrative and institutional. His belief in the positive power of leadership was to become unpopular in the more egalitarian 1960s and the position of physician superintendent&#151;which he regarded as essential to the leadership role&#151;would then disappear in England and Wales. Indeed, the mental hospitals themselves would largely be gone by the end of the century.<br>
<br>Opinions of Rees as a person vary. His successor, Stephen MacKeith, believed he had &#145;high intelligence, flexible thinking and an intuitive flair for the management of men and women&#146;  (MacKeith, 311&#150;12). For Denis Martin, &#145;his authority was never oppressive &hellip; he was a chief who encouraged ideas and initiative, and gave his staff the freedom to work out any changes in the hospital which he thought might prove valuable&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1331). The anonymous obituarist of Munk's <span class="italic">Roll</span>, however, states that Rees, &#145;did not always endear himself to his colleagues; he could be dogmatic, and obstinate, give an impression of arrogance and seem to be too interested in his own ideas to listen carefully to another point of view&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>, 345). Some of his hospital staff described him as a pocket dictator, because of his style of decision making, but on the other hand, his office door was always open and he maintained that everyone had access to him there.<br>
<br>Rees was fortunate in his time and place in that they provided an ideal milieu for the positive exercise of his particular gifts. He was rightly critical of university teaching departments who did not concern themselves with the problem of the chronic patient. In 1932 he married Adeline Isabel, daughter of F. J. Stephens of the ink manufacturing family; they had one daughter and three sons. Rees died in the Westminster Hospital, London, on 2 June 1963. He was survived by his wife.<br>
