<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shrapnel,  Henry</span>  (1761&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer and inventor of the Shrapnel shell</span>, was born on 3 June 1761, the youngest son of the nine children of Zachariah Shrapnel (1724&#150;1796) from Midway Manor House, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and his wife, Lydia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Needham). The family name appears as Shrapnell in a number of contemporary sources, including Wellington's dispatches and editions of the <span class="italic">Army List</span>. Shrapnel was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on 9 July 1779; he served in Newfoundland from 1780 to 1784, and advanced to first lieutenant on 3 December 1781. After returning to England in 1785 he began to develop, at his own expense, an explosive shell capable of being fired from existing artillery pieces; the device was in the form of a hollow spherical case, filled with small, round shot and a charge of powder, which was ignited by a fuse of variable length inserted in the base of the shell. The released shot, he hoped, would lethally spray the enemy. Before his experiments had been completed he served in Gibraltar (1787&#150;91), where he was encouraged to find that mortar shells had been fired from 24-pounder guns over Spanish positions in the recent siege with similar intent and some success. Then, for two years, Shrapnel served in the West Indies, successively at Barbados, St Vincent, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua, and St Kitts.<br>
<br>Shrapnel was promoted captain lieutenant on 15 August 1793, and eleven days later he left England with the third Royal Artillery detachment to join the duke of York's expeditionary force in Flanders; he was wounded at the unsuccessful siege of Dunkirk in September. During the British withdrawal from there Shrapnel recommended that the wheels of gun-carriages be locked, so that they skidded over the sand, and that decoy fires be lit at night away from the army's true bivouac position to attract harmless enemy fire. He remained with the British force as it fell back towards Bremen, reaching Woolwich again on 8 May 1795. Shrapnel was promoted captain on 3 October 1795, brevet major on 29 April 1802, regimental major on 1 November 1803, and regimental lieutenant-colonel on 20 July 1804. Meanwhile he had resumed work on his invention, still at his own expense and in his own time. In 1799 he submitted a proposal to the Board of Ordnance that it be adopted for use in the army; this was eventually approved in 1803. Shrapnel became the first assistant inspector of artillery at Woolwich on 10 February 1804, with wide responsibility for ordnance research and development in addition to shells. Thus, in January 1807, he recommended to Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Viscount Wellington) new, large-calibre siege-guns from the Carron works in Scotland.<br>
<br>Shrapnel's shell received favourable reports after its use during the capture of Surinam in April&#150;May 1804; and in the light of operational experience further technical improvements were made to enhance its performance. In 1808 Wellesley wrote approvingly of its worth during his first campaign in Portugal; though he argued that for security reasons its novel nature should not be publicly revealed. This, he acknowledged, would deprive Shrapnel of overt recognition, but the &#145;ingenuity and the science which he has proved he possesses by the great perfection to which he has brought this invention&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) should in itself be sufficient reward. Wellesley confirmed to Shrapnel that his shell had been most effective in the battle of Vimeiro (21 August 1808); and, in another personal letter, Lieutenant-Colonel William Robe, commanding the Royal Artillery in the Peninsula, emphasized that its &#145;dreadful&#146; impact had been noted &#145;by the French and all our own general officers, in a way highly flattering to us&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Captain H. B. Lane described to Shrapnel the &#145;immense slaughter the enemy sustained&#146;  (Duncan, 2.277) from his shells at Busaco on 27 September 1810, an outcome confirmed separately by Major J. May. However, after his initial enthusiasm Wellington told the earl of Liverpool on 12 March 1812 that his opinion in favour of the shells had lately been much shaken. He believed that difficulty in judging distance meant that fuse lengths were incorrectly set and seldom readjusted. Furthermore the wounds inflicted were &#145;of a trifling description; and they kill nobody&#146;; he likened their effect to that of &#145;duck shot&#146;, which accidentally hit &#145;the face of a person&#146; and could be easily plucked out  (<span class="italic">Dispatches</span>, 8.659). Three weeks later, on 3 April 1812, Wellington revoked his extreme criticism, acknowledging that &#145;the spherical case shot called Shrapnell's [<i>sic</i>] shells&#146; had been &#145;very destructive of the enemy&#146; at the siege of Badajoz. Nevertheless he had directed that some shells in future be loaded with &#145;musket balls&#146; to counteract the fact that the wounds currently inflicted &#145;do not disable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches</span>, 9.28). In further letters to Shrapnel from the Peninsula on 9 May 1813 and 22 October 1814, Major A. Macdonald and Lieutenant J. Sinclair described how devastating the shells had proved against exposed French field batteries at Salamanca. Three days after the victory at Waterloo, Colonel George Wood, the artillery commander, underlined his approval of the shell to its inventor. Nor was the Royal Navy unimpressed. In 1813 Vice-Admiral Sidney Smith, following correspondence with Shrapnel, privately ordered 200 shells directly from the Carron works to compensate for a shortfall in official supplies.<br>
<br>Shrapnel married on 5 May 1810 Esther Squires (1780&#150;1852) at St Mary's Church, Lambeth, in the bride's parish; they had two sons and two daughters. Shrapnel was promoted brevet colonel on 4 June 1813, and regimental colonel on 20 December 1814. He complained to the Board of Ordnance on 10 September 1813 that he had spent several thousand pounds of his own money over twenty-eight years to develop his shell, but the board replied that it had &#145;no funds at their [<i>sic</i>] disposal for the reward of merit&#146;. In 1814, however, a pension of &pound;1200 p.a. for life was granted by the government, in addition to his service pay and allowances. In fact the award was deemed to apply to all his inventive work, not just the spherical case-shot. Furthermore a narrow, bureaucratic interpretation of the terms of the award ensured that, in reality, he enjoyed scant financial gain.<br>
<br>Shrapnel advanced to major-general on 12 August 1819, and retired from active service on 29 July 1825. Nevertheless he did not stop experimenting, and in 1834 patented a percussion lock for small arms. Indeed, in addition to this and his shell, Shrapnel compiled invaluable artillery range tables, invented the brass tangent slide, and improved the efficiency of mortars and howitzers by the introduction of parabolic chambers. He is credited with devising a duplex disappearing mounting for two pieces of ordnance, so that the recoil of one gun lowered it under cover as the second was raised into a firing position. Important advances in small arms, ammunition, and fuses were also ascribed to him during his time at Woolwich. He was appointed a colonel-commandant of the Royal Artillery on 6 March 1827, and became lieutenant-general on 10 January 1837. Shortly afterwards, at Brighton, he was a guest of William IV, who extolled the virtues of his achievements. On 23 April his private secretary wrote to Shrapnel, intimating that the king intended to bestow a baronetcy on him. William IV died in June, and nothing more was heard on the subject.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1842 Shrapnel died at his residence, Peartree House, Southampton; he was buried in the family vault at Bradford-on-Avon church, Wiltshire. Several military figures, including Major-General William Nott and Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Gough, expressed their high regard for Shrapnel to his eldest son, Henry Needham Scrope (1812&#150;1896), who later submitted unsuccessful claims to the government and to parliament for further recompense for his father's inventions, given that the special pension had terminated with his death. The generic term &#145;shrapnel&#146;, widely used to describe fragments of metal from explosives, has perpetuated Henry Shrapnel's name and until the end of the First World War shells were still being manufactured according to his original principles.<br>
