<span class="headword">Steuart,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1806), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was a highland Scot from Atholl, Perthshire. He is supposed to have been a Gaelic speaker, like his brother Charles, a landscape artist who exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1764 and 1790. George probably started his career as a house-painter, but from 1770 he practised as an architect, first in Berners Street and afterwards in Harley Street, London. Indebted throughout his career to patronage from the third and fourth dukes of Atholl, his first recorded commission was a town house in 1770 for the third duke of Atholl at Grosvenor Place.<br>
<br>Steuart is best-known for three major country houses, Barons Court, co. Tyrone (1779&#150;82), for the eighth earl of Abercorn, Attingham Hall, Shropshire (1783&#150;5), for Noel Hill, created Baron Berwick in 1784, and Stoke Park, Wiltshire (1786&#150;91), for Joshua Smith. Barons Court has since been twice rebuilt, leaving little of Steuart's work, and Stoke Park was largely demolished in 1950; so it is to Attingham Hall, the grandest eighteenth-century house in Shropshire, now a property of the National Trust, that we must turn to experience Steuart's personal style at first hand.<br>
<br>Attingham exhibits Steuart's characteristic trait of columns and windows with extremely attenuated proportions. The Ionic columns on the entrance portico are so tall and slender that they appear at first sight to be of metal. The house has an unusual plan, rather like a royal palace with separate suites on either side for king and queen. At Attingham the masculine suite is on the west side, leading from the library to the dining-room, and the feminine on the east, leading from the conservatory to the drawing-room. The two suites meet in the entrance hall, the whole disposition conforming with contemporary French notions of the expression of appropriate character in architecture and interior decoration. Lady Berwick's circular boudoir, indeed, is elegantly painted with Louis XVI-style decoration recalling interiors such as Marie Antoinette's cabinet de toilette at Fontainebleau. The attenuated proportions of Attingham recurred in Steuart's Lythwood Hall, Shropshire (<i>c</i>.1785; remodelled 1950), in his unexecuted designs of 1780 for Onslow Hall, Shropshire, and in his ambitious Stoke Park, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Steuart also designed two churches in Shropshire: All Saints', Wellington (1790), and New St Chad's, Shrewsbury (1790&#150;92), one of the most inventive churches of its date in the country. In the former, the slender cast-iron supports in the internal galleries have been removed, but they survive at St Chad's. This was a radical volumetric composition in which, rather in the manner of the contemporary French architect Claude-Nicholas Ledoux, Steuart overturned the unifying compositional methods of baroque architects. Instead, he broke up the building into disparate, self-contained parts in a kind of architectural egalitarianism. Above the Doric entrance portico rises an imposing west tower of three separate parts: the first stage, rusticated and square, supports an octagon which is surmounted by a domed cylindrical rotunda surrounded by detached Corinthian columns. A circular hall under the tower leads to an elliptical vestibule and so into the vast circular nave&#151;an unusual but practical solution to the problem of seating a large congregation focused on the pulpit. Steuart was one of the first architects since Sir Christopher Wren to give thought to the planning of a setting for Anglican liturgy. The excellent construction of the church, in local Grinshill stone, was supervised by John Simpson (1755&#150;1815), the engineer of the Caledonian Canal, who built bridges for Thomas Telford.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Steuart lived at Douglas on the Isle of Man, where the dukes of Atholl were the governors and principal landowners. In the 1790s he built the pier and lighthouse at Douglas, and the court houses at Douglas and Ramsey, his last work being Castle Mona, Douglas (1801&#150;6), for the fourth duke of Atholl. He died on 20 December 1806 at his home, Lough House, Douglas, and was buried in Kirk Braddan churchyard. Drawings by him survive at Attingham Hall and in the drawings collection of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
