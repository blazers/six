<span class="headword">Blow,  Detmar Jellings</span>  (1867&#150;1939), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 24 November 1867 at the Two Ashes, Forest Hill, Sydenham, Kent, the third of five children of Jellings Blow (<i>d</i>. 1898) and his German-born wife, Johanna Antoinette Finke (<i>d</i>. after 1910). His father was a merchant in the City of London and the family later moved to 96 Cheyne Row in Chelsea; his mother was taught to play the piano by Clara Schumann. Blow went to Hawtreys School before beginning his architectural education in 1883 at the South Kensington School of Art, where he met Edwin Lutyens. Articled for a four-year period to the firm of Wieson, Son, and Aldwinckle, Blow attended the Architectural Association evening classes from 1887. In June 1888 he was awarded the Architectural Association travelling studentship and, in November, first prize in the class of design.<br>
<br>On commencing his travelling studentship in France, Blow met John Ruskin by chance on 25 June 1888 at the T&ecirc;te de B&#339;uf in Abbeville. As a direct result Blow put off his studies at Beauvais Cathedral, and spent the next six months travelling with Ruskin, an experience that was to shape the rest of his career. Soon after his return he met William Morris and Philip Webb, whose principles as inculcated through the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) instilled in Blow the belief that architecture had to be undertaken at first hand, through a direct involvement in the building process. Like Morris, he considered architecture an art rather than a profession. Later he attended the master's deathbed in 1896. Decking a yellow harvest wagon with willow boughs and vine leaves, he drove Morris's coffin to the grave in a waggoner's smock.<br>
<br>In 1892 Blow won the Royal Institute of British Architects' Pugin scholarship with his drawings of Beauvais Cathedral and Barfreston church in Kent. Before this Webb had introduced him to his first client, Hugh Fairfax-Cholmeley, for whom he built Mill Hill (1891), a small house in Brandsby, Yorkshire. Under Webb's guidance Blow had determined to forsake the conventional architect's office for an itinerant lifestyle and he lived on site throughout much of the construction period, thus embarking on the first and perhaps most significant period of his career, as a wandering architect.<br>
<br>Webb introduced Blow to work on site for the SPAB also, as a result of which he repaired the church tower at East Knoyle, Wiltshire (1892). His involvement in other SPAB projects included the rescue of the Old Post Office (1896), a small medieval manor house in Tintagel, Cornwall (now belonging to the National Trust). He worked on site at Lake House, Wiltshire (1897), and on other church towers at Clare, Suffolk (1898&#150;9), and Amesbury, Wiltshire (1901). Blow's early clients included Lord Antrobus at Amesbury Abbey and he was on hand when one of the trilithons at nearby Stonehenge fell in a gale on the last day of 1900. Antrobus, then the owner of Stonehenge, worked in conjunction with Blow, the SPAB, and the Society of Antiquaries and, although the fallen stone was not re-erected until 1958, Blow straightened an adjacent leaning stone, all that remained standing of the largest of the trilithons, in 1901.<br>
<br>Detmar Blow's work as a wandering architect encompassed new work as well as old. Sharing a London base from 1897 with Alfred Powell&#151;another itinerant SPAB architect to emerge from under the wing of Philip Webb&#151;the two men worked on Long Copse, Ewhurst, Surrey, from 1895, with Powell taking the lead. From 1897 Blow worked in association with another of their friends, the architect and furniture designer Ernest Gimson. He built three cottages in the Charnwood Forest near Leicester to Gimson's designs. A larger-scaled product of their association, the flint-walled and thatch-roofed Happisburgh Manor, Norfolk (1900), is attributed solely to Blow.<br>
<br>Throughout this period Blow worked with a band of itinerant masons, two of whom&#151;Frank Green and James Neale&#151;had been with him from the start at East Knoyle and taught him their trade. Indeed both men continued to work for Blow into the twentieth century, Green being on site at Wilsford Manor (1904) near Salisbury and Neale at Little Ridge, later extended and known as Fonthill House, near Tisbury, Wiltshire (also 1904; dem. 1972). These new houses represent the culmination of Blow's wandering career: hand-built by craftsmen, they were made of local materials and by local building techniques. Both incorporated materials from earlier houses.<br>
<br>Blow's timeless way of working was swamped by demand. His meteoric rise as a society architect followed, and partnership with the Frenchman Fernand Billerey in 1905 added a fashionable <i>beaux-arts</i> dimension to the practice's output. Together they undertook an enormous number of commissions in the years leading up to the First World War, rivalling Lutyens in the country house market. Typical of the practice's output were the enlargement and alteration of Breccles Hall, Norfolk (1907; later altered again by Lutyens); Heale House, near Salisbury, Wiltshire (<i>c</i>.1910); and Broome Park, Kent (from 1911), for Lord Kitchener. New houses included Horwood, Buckinghamshire (1911). Blow and Billerey worked on many London houses too: their interior at 10 Carlton House Terrace and the enlargement of 34 Queen Anne's Gate both attracted attention.<br>
<br>On 5 November 1910 Blow married Winifred Gertrude, the second daughter of the Hon. Hamilton Tollemache, in St Paul's Cathedral. His itinerant mason friends were given pride of place in the front pews and the house Blow built from 1913 for his growing family (eventually consisting of two sons and two daughters) at Hilles, near Painswick, Gloucestershire, harks back to his earlier style. During the Edwardian years Blow became increasingly friendly with the maverick second duke of Westminster, freeholder of the Grosvenor estate in London. This led to considerable work for Blow and Billerey, including Mimizan, a hunting-lodge outside Bordeaux for the duke himself (1911), and buildings on his Mayfair estate. The commission for Government House, Salisbury, Rhodesia (1911), also came through the duke. During the First World War, Blow at first worked for Kitchener in France, but following the latter's death in 1916 he accepted a post as the duke of Westminster's private secretary, with an undefined overview of his London estates. This led to friction with the Grosvenor estate's surveyor, Edmund Wimperis. When Wimperis resigned in 1928, Blow succeeded him. Although he had given up architecture himself, he used his influence with the duke to promote Lutyens and his former partner Billerey as consultants for major development schemes on the Mayfair estate, notably the rebuilding of Grosvenor Square. In March 1933, however, Blow was abruptly dismissed, following unproven allegations of dishonesty. He retired with impaired health to Hilles, where he died from coronary thrombosis on 7 February 1939. Like Morris, he was carried to his hillside grave near by, overlooking Gloucester, on a farm cart.<br>
