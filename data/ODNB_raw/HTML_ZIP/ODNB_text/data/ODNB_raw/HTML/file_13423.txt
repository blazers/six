<span class="headword">Hodges,  Nathaniel</span>  (1629&#150;1688), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 14 September 1629 in Kensington, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66142/', "Thomas Hodges")</script>, dean of Hereford. He was a king's scholar at Westminster School, and in 1646 was awarded a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge. He transferred to Oxford in 1648, and was appointed by the parliamentary visitors to a studentship at Christ Church (BA 1651, MA 1654, MD 1659). In 1654 Hodges contributed to the Oxford volume of verse issued to celebrate the peace with the Dutch. He practised medicine from his house in Walbrook, London, where he was admitted as a candidate for fellowship of the College of Physicians in 1659; he was not admitted to fellowship until 1672, an unusually long delay.<br>
<br>When the plague broke out in London in 1665, Hodges remained in the City. The College of Physicians and the Society of Chemical Physicians disagreed on the causes and best treatment of the plague; while at Christ Church, Hodges had belonged to the Oxford Experimental Philosophy Club, and his own understanding of the plague set it within a largely Galenic framework of humoral medicine, but also showed the influence of Paracelsian ideas. It is significant that in 1656 he and either his father or his brother, also Thomas, translated from the Latin Michael Maier's <span class="italic">Themis aurea</span> (1618), dedicating it to Elias Ashmole. This work recommends the prudent use of chemical methods in drug preparation, so that the &#145;occult property&#146; of a substance may be extracted in its pure form. In 1666 Hodges published <span class="italic">Vindiciae medicinae et medicorum: an Apology for the Profession and Professors of Physic</span>, where he attacked both those who rejected all of chemistry and those who embraced chemical ideas at the expense of Galenism; a good physician, Hodges argued, was one who did not &#145;stiffly adhere to one or the other party&#146;. By 1666, having seen the lack of success of chemical remedies for the plague, Hodges reviled Paracelsians as &#145;these scandalous opposers of the college&#146;. A contagionist, he believed that the plague was spread by &#145;pestilential effluxes&#146; from person to person, but he considered that the availability of very cheap cherries and grapes had contributed to making bodies more open to such effluxes.<br>
<br>As medical adviser to the City, directing a group of physicians serving London during the outbreak, Hodges recommended the isolation of the sick and also, in separate accommodation, of those who had been in contact with them. He did not consider there was any benefit in shutting up the sick with the well, while isolation in one's own home could be fatal, as the healthy would shun the sick and normal neighbourly help would be withdrawn. Hodges believed that collective action by the City should be supported by personal responsibility for the maintenance of health. To prevent the plague, he recommended drinking sack, on the basis that it encouraged breathing through the pores and thus drew out any early infection. Twice during the epidemic Hodges felt as if he had been infected, despite his precautions of taking an anti-pestilential electuary before seeing patients in the morning, and burning a disinfectant on hot coals when entering a house where there was a plague sufferer, but after increasing his intake of sack he felt better. Drugs to bring on sweating were also prescribed for sufferers, as were open blisters and &#145;issues&#146; in the left arm and right leg, through which impurities could pass out of the body. Hodges criticized the prophylactic and curative use of amulets and tobacco, and also attacked old nurses who used human excrement as an antidote to plague. In 1671 he completed his account of the plague, which was published in 1672 as <span class="italic">Loimologia, sive, Pestis nuperae apud populum Londinensem grassantis narratio historica</span>. This was translated into English in 1720, but was edited by John Quincy to remove &#145;the most affected peculiarities and luxuriances&#146; from the prose style. There also survives, in a collection of pieces on the plague published in 1721, &#145;An account of the first rise, progress, symptoms and cure of the plague: being the substance of a letter from Dr Hodges to a person of quality&#146; (it is dated 6 May 1666).<br>
<br>Hodges was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians on 2 April 1672; he was censor in 1682 and delivered the Harveian oration in 1683. As censor he presented the college with a fire engine, for which he received a &pound;15 deduction in his subscription. This is the first hint of the financial difficulties which led to Hodges's imprisonment in Ludgate for debt; he died there on 10 June 1688. He was buried at St Stephen Walbrook, where his bust and inscription are still to be seen. Hodges's medical commonplace book survives in the British Library (Sloane MS 810); it contains over 1000 pages, most of them blank, apart from the headings. In addition to organizing material under such headings according to the pattern definition, signs, prognosis, and treatment, and including recipes and case histories from his practice dating from the 1650s, Hodges pasted in letters, including one from Thomas Willis. The book includes a chart of diseases (fol. 434).<br>
<br>Hodges's insistence on staying in London during the plague is an action for which he has been all but canonized by medical historians; his account of his practice in this period, cautiously used, remains one of the best sources of information on the medical and social effects of this disease.<br>
