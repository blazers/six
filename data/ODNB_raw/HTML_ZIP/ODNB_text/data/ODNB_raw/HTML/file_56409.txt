<span class="headword">Bradbury,  William Hardwick</span>  (1832&#150;1892), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76346/', "William Bradbury (1800&#150;1869)")</script>, co-owner of the printing and publishing firm Bradbury and Evans, and his wife, Sarah, was born in London in December 1832. After attending a private school in Brighton, he attended University College School in Gower Street, London, from 1843 to 1848. Originally intended for the bar, Bradbury soon gravitated to the family business, spending two years working in publishing and bookselling in Dublin before entering the Bradbury and Evans publishing house in Bouverie Street, London. It is said that Bradbury and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3168/', "Henry Riley Bradbury")</script> joined Frederick Evans, son of their father's partner Frederick Mullet Evans, in printing the sheets of Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> (20 parts as 19, May 1849&#150;November 1850), being careful to let no other employees know what the next instalment would contain.<br>
<br>Until summer 1858 the firm's relations with Dickens, one of their most profitable authors, remained cordial; they continued to publish his novels and his weekly serial, <span class="italic">Household Words</span>. But during spring that year Dickens separated from his wife, Catherine, and in June he published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (7 June) and in <span class="italic">Household Words</span> (12 June) a statement declaring that his &#145;domestic trouble&#146; had been &#145;amicably composed&#146;, and that rumours involving other people &#145;are abominably false&#146;. Though he never asked his publishers to insert the announcement in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, Dickens felt so aggrieved because it did not appear there that he initiated what proved to be a long and complicated severing of his contractual relations with the firm. In March 1859 Dickens announced a rival journal, <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, into which he folded <span class="italic">Household Words</span> when Bradbury and Evans auctioned it off two months later on 16 May. Dickens purchased the copyright and stock for &pound;3500. He estimated that the stock was worth about &pound;1600; he sold it, with some other stock and plates, to Chapman and Hall on 19 May for &pound;2500. Bradbury and Evans countered with a new periodical of their own, <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, edited by Samuel Lucas and illustrated by many of the leading <span class="italic">Punch</span> artists. But after encouraging initial sales and contributions from Harriet Martineau, Alfred Tennyson, and George Henry Lewes, among others, the circulation sank to about 35,000 by the mid-1860s. (It was eventually sold in 1869.) During this period Bradbury and Evans were entangled in complicated legal suits with Dickens, and Dickens's eldest son, Charley, was engaged to Evans's daughter Bessie 
    (Elizabeth Matilda Moule Evans, <i>d</i>. 1907)
  , whom he married on 19 November 1861.<br>
<br>In the midst of these troubles, on 2 September 1860, Bradbury's older brother Henry committed suicide. The family house at 13 Upper Woburn Place, Dickens reported to W. H. Wills, &#145;looked grim and dry, with all the blinds down, brooding in a hot, dusty, tearless, frozen kind of way, at the unsympathetic street&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 302, 4 Sept 1860). Henry had gone into business for himself as a &#145;nature printer&#146;, but he had often worked as well in his father's firm. After his brother's death W. H. Bradbury crossed over from the publishing side of the firm to assume the supervision of its extensive and demanding printing business. It was a bad time for the firm. Dickens cut his former publishers. He did not attend Charley's wedding and he never again spoke to Frederick Mullet Evans. When Dickens learned that Charley was going into partnership with Bessie's brother Frederick Moule Evans in the Postford Paper-Making Company, he was unhappy  (ibid., 508 and n. 3). During the 1860s several of the firm's periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Gardener's Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette</span> and <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, were sold off. And the founding partners grew weary. In 1865 both retired. W. H. Bradbury and Frederick Moule Evans took over from their fathers. Shortly after Henry's death Bradbury had married Laura, sister of the art dealer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30348/', "William Agnew (1825&#150;1910)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65633/', "Agnew family")</script>]. The couple had three daughters and one son. When Evans decided to withdraw from the firm in 1872, refinancing with Agnew money produced new family partners and a new company name: Bradbury, Agnew &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Bradbury, who assumed the position of chairman, kept <span class="italic">Punch</span>, but otherwise ceased to publish books and periodicals, although until 1885 he maintained the tradition of an annual dinner at the Bedford in September celebrating the publication of <span class="italic">Punch's Almanack</span>. He died at his home, Oak Lodge, Nightingale Lane, Clapham, Surrey, on 13 October 1892. His estate was proved on 9 December at &pound;33,034 0<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. His son W. Lawrence Bradbury succeeded as joint managing director alongside William Agnew.<br>
