<span class="headword">Fell,  Sheila Mary</span>  (1931&#150;1979), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 20 July 1931, at 69 Queen Street, Aspatria, Cumberland, where she was baptized in the Methodist chapel. Her home was in an area that was associated with agriculture and coalmining, an industry that was then declining. Her father, John (Jack) Fell (<i>d</i>. 1976), was a miner who came from a long line of farmers, and her mother, Anne Murray (<i>d</i>. 1982), was a seamstress. Both parents were intelligent and musical. Sheila Fell's account of her childhood is remarkable for its clear recall of her early visual memories, artistic nature, and acute sensitivity. She recalled &#145;the lozenge shapes, dots and daisy patterns&#146; on her mother's aprons, and the &#145;hard blue ovals, delicate green, pink or lemon smudges scrawled with thin lines, luminous and strange, they ran over the coverlet of my bed&#146; (a description of some tiny spiders in rolled-up leaves which her mother gave her and which fascinated her as she was recovering from a serious childhood illness)  (Goldman, 58, 60).<br>
<br>At five Sheila Fell went to the primary school in Aspatria; later she attended the Nelson Tomlinson Girls' Grammar School in Wigton. She took her music exams with no difficulty&#151;gifted in anything she attempted. A former teacher, Catherine Campbell-Taylor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Rooke), recalled that &#145;Her work was outstanding and she had fantastic concentration&#146;  (private information). Torn between studying music, ballet, or art, after a year in the sixth form she went to Carlisle School of Art. From the age of sixteen she felt a need to get away from Aspatria despite the pain of separation from her parents to whom she was close. In 1947 she travelled every day to and from Carlisle School of Art and it was suggested that she should study textile design. Sheila argued, &#145;I want to be a painter. I don't want to do design or teach or anything but PAINTING&#146;  (private information). She began reading about the lives of painters, sculptors, and poets. After taking the first part of her diploma she went to St Martin's School of Art, London (1949&#150;51). &#145;Bitterly homesick for years, longing for the holidays, living on nothing with little food&#146; were her memories of this period  (<span class="italic">Sheila Fell</span>, South Bank Centre, 42). Her mother used to send food parcels. Sheila could not afford paint so she drew a lot at that time.<br>
<br>Fell's capacity for work was enormous. Teachers included Vivian Pitchforth, John Napper, and Josef Herman, and in her many black and white studies of miners in Aspatria there is a strong connection with the work of Herman, whose drawings and paintings of Ystradgynlais miners are similarly rugged, bold, and economically stated. The work of C&eacute;zanne and Van Gogh was also important to her development as an artist. The painter Helen Lessore, who ran the Beaux Arts Gallery in London, saw some of her work in a friend's house and in 1955 offered Sheila the first of five exhibitions. Still under twenty-five years old, she was the youngest person to be given a one-man show there.<br>
<br>At her first show three of Fell's pictures were bought by L. S. Lowry, who became her lifelong friend and patron. He arranged to meet her after the show and then her parents, hiring a car to take him to their house in Aspatria. Hunter Davies in his interview with her in 1979 described the meetings. Lowry called her Miss Fell until nearly the end of her life and at their home referred to her as &#145;the child&#146;. &#145;Without the friendship of L. S. Lowry my life would have been infinitely poorer&#146;, she said  (<span class="italic">Sheila Fell</span>, South Bank Centre, 43).<br>
<br>In 1957 Fell was a prize-winner in the biennial John Moores exhibition in Liverpool, and in 1958 she travelled to Greece on a Boise scholarship and had her second exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery. She began teaching at the Chelsea School of Art. This year she also met the local GP in Aspatria, Dr Dalzell, and his wife, Kathleen, also a doctor, and both became for her important patrons and friends. Her early work, often on vertical canvases, rather than on the more frequent horizontal of later works, was immensely powerful and appeals to a deep level of consciousness. Her preoccupation with the landscape of north Cumberland forced out of her an intensity of feeling in snow scenes and mysterious dark charcoal drawings which reveal an intense search for expression.<br>
<br>In 1957 Fell had a baby girl, Anna. Articles began appearing about her work in major journals. In 1961 Kathleen Dalzell arranged an exhibition in Cockermouth. This was followed by one at Middlesbrough Art Gallery, 1962, and Maryport Educational Centre, 1964. In 1965 she began exhibiting at the Royal Academy besides holding exhibitions at Abbot Hall, Kendal, and in Leeds. In 1966 a show of her work was held at Hampstead New Art Gallery, and Melvyn Bragg made his first television film about her. In 1967 and 1969 she showed at the Stone Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, at the instigation of L. S. Lowry. The latter was delighted when she was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. In 1970 she received an Austin Abbey award. In 1974 she was elected Royal Academician and in 1976 exhibited in &#145;British painting, 1952&#150;77&#146; at the Royal Academy. Her last exhibition was in 1979 at the New Grafton Gallery, London.<br>
<br>Despite her great beauty, dynamic personality, and talent for friendship, Fell was prone to lonely bouts of depression, when she smoked and drank to excess. On 15 December 1979 she fell down the stairs at her home, 41 Redcliffe Square, London, and died. She was cremated on 24 December in London. In 1990 the South Bank Centre put on a touring exhibition organized by Caroline Collier showing seventy-six paintings selected from Fell's early work of 1949 and that of the next thirty years. Apart from charcoal sketches of miners, and a few brilliant portraits, for example those of her mother and father, her subject matter was mainly rural north Cumberland and its inhabitants, typified by <span class="italic">The Potato Pickers</span> (1960; Arts Council). She greatly admired Van Gogh. Occasionally she used watercolour, but usually worked in oil paint. At St Martin's College Sheila Fell had come into contact with other Beaux Arts artists, Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach, whose work she held in high regard. Perhaps her use of very thick paint resulted from the influence of their expressionist work. Although in her later pictures paint was applied more thinly it still retained its vibrancy.<br>
<br>Sheila Fell was &#145;one of the most outstanding landscape artists of her generation&#146; with a &#145;vision that ranges from the dark and fiercely oppressive to the tender and elegiac&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sheila Fell</span>, South Bank Centre, 43). The powerfully expressed relationships between sky and land, the intensity of atmosphere, and a &#145;monumental quality&#146;  (private information) are all conveyed in the beautiful quality of her paint. From the sculptural, unsentimental portraits of her mother, to the solid, timeless rolling landscapes of north Cumberland she used colour with supreme skill and the liquid effect of light on cloud, water, undulating ploughed fields, and harvests makes her a rare painter. Examples of her work are in the Tate collection; the Royal Academy, London; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Sheffield Art Gallery; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne; Abbot Hall, Kendal, Cumbria; the Government Art Collection; and the Arts Council collection.<br>
