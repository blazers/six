<span class="headword">Creed,  John Martin</span>  (1889&#150;1940), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born in All Saints' parish, Leicester, on 14 October 1889, the eldest son of Colin John Creed, vicar of All Saints' Church, and his wife, Etheldreda Wright, daughter of Frederick Robert Spackman, a doctor of Harpenden, Hertfordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32625/', "Sir Thomas Percival Creed")</script> was his brother. John Creed was educated at the Wyggeston grammar school, Leicester, and, from 1908, at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a scholar and obtained first classes in part one of the classical tripos (1911) and in part two of the theological tripos (1912). In 1913 he was ordained as assistant curate at St Paul's Church, Manningham, Bradford, and in 1914 was elected a fellow of Caius, where he returned as chaplain in 1915. From 1917 to 1919 he was a chaplain to the British forces in France.<br>
<br>After the First World War, in 1919, Creed was elected a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and appointed dean and lecturer in theology. Although not good with students, in 1926 he succeeded A. E. Brooke as Ely professor of divinity and honorary canon of Ely Cathedral. In 1927 Creed married May Geraldine, the younger daughter of Alfred Leslie Lilley, canon of Hereford. They had one son and three daughters, the youngest of whom died in childhood. Creed held his post as Ely professor and canon of the cathedral until his death, at the Evelyn Nursing Home in Cambridge, on 17 February 1940. He had been elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1939.<br>
<br>Creed's historical and theological outlook was very much that handed down by the so-called Cambridge &#145;triumvirate&#146; of J. B. Lightfoot, B. F. Westcott, and F. J. A. Hort. His main scholarly contributions were in the field of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies and the early Christian age; they included his <span class="italic">The Gospel According to St. Luke: the Greek Text with Introduction, Notes, and Indices</span> (1930), a critical commentary concerned especially with the composition of St Luke's narrative and its stage in the development of the gospel tradition, and journal articles, especially in the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, which he edited from the end of 1935. One of his more noteworthy articles was a discussion of the early Christian document known as the <span class="roman">Didache</span>  (<span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, 39, 1938, 370&#150;87). He was also increasingly interested in the history of religious thought of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which, although widely separated from the early Christian era, shed light upon it in his view, as was shown in his <span class="italic">Religious Thought in the Eighteenth Century Illustrated from Writers of the Period</span> (1934, written in collaboration with J. S. Boys Smith), and his Hulsean lectures delivered at Cambridge in 1936 and published in 1938 as <span class="italic">The Divinity of Jesus Christ: a Study in the History of Christian Doctrine since Kant</span>.<br>
<br>Creed was deeply interested in the history of the Church of England and in the meaning of Anglicanism and was considered a sound representative of Anglican values. He believed that a national church was a natural counterpart to the political and social order of a world in which the nation was the fundamental political and cultural unit. Being strongly pro-monarchist, he also thought that the association of church and state in England had fostered a wholesome contact between the sacred and the secular. This position, stated in a number of published articles and sermons, gave added weight to his views as a member of the archbishops' commission on Christian doctrine, the report of which was published in 1938 as <span class="italic">Doctrine in the Church of England</span>.<br>
