<span class="headword">Seymour,  Frederick Beauchamp Paget</span>, Baron Alcester  (1821&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 12 April 1821. He was the son of Colonel Sir Horace Beauchamp Seymour and his first wife, Elizabeth Malet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palk (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of Sir Lawrence Palk, bt; his grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25175/', "Lord Hugh Seymour")</script>, and his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25170/', "Sir George Francis Seymour")</script>. He received his early education at Eton College, and entered the navy in January 1834. He passed his examination in 1840; served as a mate in the <i>Britannia</i>, flagship of Sir John Acworth Ommanney, in the Mediterranean, and was promoted lieutenant on 7 March 1842. He was then appointed to the frigate <i>Thalia</i> (Captain George Hope) in the Pacific; and from 1844 to 1847 was flag-lieutenant to his uncle, Sir George Seymour, commander-in-chief in the Pacific. On 5 June 1847 he was promoted commander. In 1852 he served as a volunteer on the staff of General Godwin in Burma, and was four times gazetted for distinguished conduct. In May 1853 he commissioned the <i>Brisk</i> for the North America and West Indies station, from where he was recalled early in 1854 and sent to the White Sea in the squadron under Commodore Sir Erasmus Ommanney. In May 1855 he was appointed to the floating battery <i>Meteor</i>, which he took out to the Crimea, and brought back to Portsmouth in the early summer of 1856. In July 1857 he commissioned the <i>Pelorus</i>, which he commanded for nearly six years on the Australian station. Between January and April 1858 the <i>Pelorus</i> provided a naval brigade in Burma, playing a vital role in preventing the spread of the mutiny from India. From 1860 to 1861 he commanded the naval brigade in New Zealand during the war there, for which he was made a CB on 16 July 1861.<br>
<br>From 1868 to 1870 Seymour was private secretary to the first lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, and helped to keep the troubled Admiralty board from complete collapse. On 1 April 1870 he was promoted rear-admiral. From December 1870 to May 1872 he commanded the flying squadron, and from 1872 to 1874 was a lord of the Admiralty. From 1874 to 1877 he commanded the Channel Fleet; he was made a vice-admiral on 31 December 1876 and a KCB on 2 June 1877. In 1876 he agreed to a compact with Geoffrey Phipps Hornby and Astley Cooper Key: all three would refuse to accept the post of senior naval lord without securing certain specific reforms of the Admiralty. In 1879 Key took the post, without securing those reforms.<br>
<br>From 1880 to 1883 Seymour was commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and so, in 1880, commanded the European squadron sent to the Albanian coast following Turkish refusal to cede Dulcigno to Montenegro. On the dispersal of the fleet after the Porte had yielded, Seymour received the thanks of the government and was made a GCB, on 24 May 1881. In the following year he commanded at the bombardment of the Alexandria fortifications (11 July), and afterwards in the operations on the coast of Egypt. For this he was made Baron Alcester of Alcester in the county of Warwickshire, and received a parliamentary grant of &pound;25,000, the freedom of the City of London, and a sword of honour. From March 1883 to June 1885 he was again a lord of the Admiralty, and on 12 April 1886 was retired.<br>
<br>During the following years Seymour lived principally in London, where his genial nature made him a favourite in society, while his attention to his dress and appearance gained him the name of the &#145;Ocean Swell&#146;. Latterly his eyesight failed and his health deteriorated. He died at 3 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 30 March 1895, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery, near Woking on 3 April. He was unmarried, and at his death the title became extinct.<br>
<br>After an early career dominated by operations on shore, Seymour matured into an able and active flag officer, both afloat and at the Admiralty. He commanded, at Alexandria, the only battle fleet action between 1855 and 1914. He accepted his peerage, the first conferred for naval service afloat since 1856, on behalf of the service, rather than as a personal reward, and contributed to the efforts made in several quarters to raise the prestige of the service. He was one of the leading flag officers of his generation.<br>
