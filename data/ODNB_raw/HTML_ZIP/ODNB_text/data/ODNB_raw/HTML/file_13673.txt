<span class="headword">Hood,  Edwin Paxton</span>  (1820&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and writer</span>, son of Thomas Hood, an able seaman who had served under Nelson on the <i>T&eacute;m&eacute;raire</i>, and a maidservant to Bishop Beilby Porteous's brother, was born in the latter's home, Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, on 24 October 1820. The child was fostered by Mr Simpson, a heraldic painter, and his wife, of Deptford, members of Greenwich Road Tabernacle. Edwin attended Union Chapel, Lewisham, and then Midway Place Chapel, Deptford. He also sat at the feet of Thomas Binney at the King's Weigh House Chapel: here he imbibed the romantic, liberalized theology later conspicuous in his own preaching. He began to lead worship and to lecture on temperance and peace, and in 1840 became a full-time temperance worker. In York in 1847 he met and married Jane Wagstaff (<i>b</i>. 1824/5), who died in childbirth the following year. He was a delegate to the Paris peace conference in 1848. From 1852 to 1857 he was Congregational minister at North Nibley, Gloucestershire: he described this appointment as his &#145;college training&#146;. In 1853 he married Elizabeth Atkin Barnly (<i>b</i>. 1824/5) of Hull, but she died of consumption two years later. At Nibley he began to write hymns for Sunday school anniversaries, and these rank among his best compositions.<br>
<br>From 1857 to 1862 Hood served at Offord Road Church, Islington, a new cause which he built up as a thriving middle-class congregation with a strong working-class fringe. In 1857 he married his third wife, Lavinia, daughter of the Revd S. Oughton of Kingston, Jamaica&#151;she outlived him. Offord Road was troubled by a serious burden of debt, and in 1862 he moved to Queen Street, Brighton, where the church had to be enlarged to house his growing congregation. Surprisingly he returned to Offord Road in 1873, even though the surrounding area was deteriorating and the debt problem remained. In 1877 he was called to the prestigious pulpit of Cavendish Street, Manchester. He began badly by fiercely attacking Disraeli's foreign policy from the pulpit. This so divided his flock that his health became impaired and he resigned in 1880, preaching to his supporters for a short time in Hulme town hall. He visited the USA and then for four years pastored the historic Falcon Square Chapel, London, where he seems to have found a peace which had long eluded him.<br>
<br>Hood, a restless, quixotic and inspirational activist, wrote many books, popular biographies, temperance and peace literature, textbooks for young people, and appreciations of his own age. Two of these last are particularly notable: <span class="italic">The Age and its Architects</span> (1852), in which he famously defines and explores his own times as &#145;an age of experiment&#146; with an absence of &#145;all present faith and belief&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Throne of Eloquence</span> (1885), a keenly observed introduction to earlier, but especially Victorian, preachers and preaching. He was for eight years editor of the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span> and for two years edited the <span class="italic">Preachers' Lantern</span>. He played some part in putting the poetry of Robert Browning on the literary map. The British Library catalogue lists more than sixty of his publications. He was a great friend of, and fund-raiser for, the Hospital for Incurables, but after his death was best known as a hymn writer, particularly for children. He edited <span class="italic">Our Hymn Book</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">The Children's Choir</span> (1870). Though a later age found many of his hymns too cloying, some, especially &#145;I love to think though I am young&#146; and &#145;God who hath made the daisies&#146;, were still being anthologized in the mid-twentieth century.<br>
<br>He took his last services at Falcon Square Chapel on 7 June 1885 and then departed on a tour of Italy; he had reached only Paris when he died on 12 June 1885. He was buried in Abney Park cemetery.<br>
