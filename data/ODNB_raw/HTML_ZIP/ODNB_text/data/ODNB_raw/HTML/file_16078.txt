<span class="headword">Lascelles,  Henry</span>, second earl of Harewood  (1767&#150;1841), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Stapleton, Yorkshire, on 25 December 1767, the second son of Edward Lascelles, first earl of Harewood (1740&#150;1820), and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1805), daughter of William Chaloner. He was a descendant of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63019/', "Henry Lascelles (bap. 1690, d. 1753)")</script>, who had established the family's wealth, partly as a slave trader in Barbados. On 2 September 1794 he married Henrietta (1770&#150;1840), eldest daughter of Sir John Saunders Sebright. Queen Charlotte wrote, on his engagement: &#145;the gay Lothario is to wed the sedate and retired wife &hellip; beauty there is none nor fortune on the female side&#146;  (Harcourt, 6.44). Of their seven sons and four daughters, the eldest boy, Edward, died in 1839 and the second, Henry, succeeded to the title.<br>
<br>In 1796 Lascelles was elected unopposed as MP for Yorkshire, standing as a Pittite. He was re-elected in 1802, but did not stand in 1806, knowing that he would be opposed for his hostility to restrictions on woollen manufacturing. In 1807 he was again a candidate for Yorkshire in the first contested election which had occurred for sixty-six years. The struggle was also memorable on account of the vast expense that Lascelles incurred: nearly &pound;100,000. William Wilberforce, whose party almost entirely lacked organization, was head of the poll. Lascelles, who was opposed by clothiers threatered by the removal of protection for their trade, and subjected to polemic about his family's slavery interests, was beaten by Lord Milton; he sat instead for Westbury (bought by his father). On 6 October 1812 he was returned for Pontefract; but Wilberforce having retired from the representation of the county, Lascelles came in as his substitute on 16 October. Probably in consequence of the enormous sums he had expended in electioneering in the county, he chose to sit for the family borough of Northallerton in 1818. In the House of Commons he voted as a moderate tory and spoke fairly often. On 13 February 1800 he supported the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill</span>, and on 3 November 1801 voted for the preliminaries for peace with France. He seconded the appointment of Charles Abbot (afterwards first Baron Colchester) as speaker on 11 February 1802, and took the moderate side in the debate on the prince of Wales's debts on 4 March 1803. He moved the second reading of the <span class="roman">Woollen Manufacturers Bill</span> on 13 June 1804, the first of a series of efforts to liberalize the trade. The whigs tested him &#145;against the Opposition&#146; and he opposed parliamentary reform and, once in the Lords, Catholic emancipation. He supported modest change to the 1815 corn laws and was a moderate supporter of retrenchment. After the death of his elder brother in 1814 he was styled Viscount Lascelles, and when, in 1819, Earl Fitzwilliam was removed on political grounds from the lord lieutenancy of the West Riding, Lascelles was appointed in his place. On 3 April 1820&#151;while seeking a coronation peerage&#151;he succeeded his father in the earldom. He took little part in the debates in the House of Lords. He was opposed to the bill of pains and penalties against Queen Caroline. On 7 October 1831 he declared himself a moderate reformer, and favoured the extension of representation, but opposed the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. In the Lords he was of &#145;the middle or moderate party&#146;, a designation which reflected his general political posture.<br>
<br>Lascelles's chief interest lay in country life. He maintained the Harewood hunt and died, on 24 November 1841, at Bramham in Yorkshire, just after returning from a run with the hounds.<br>
