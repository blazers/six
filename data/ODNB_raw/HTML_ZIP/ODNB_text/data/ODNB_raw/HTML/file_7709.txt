<span class="headword">Dixon,  William Hepworth</span>  (1821&#150;1879), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born on 30 June 1821 at Newton Street, Great Ancoats, in Manchester, the son of Abner Dixon and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cryer, of whom little is known. He grew up in Over Darwen, where he was tutored by his great-uncle, Michael Beswick. He later became clerk to a merchant named Thompson at Manchester. He married, on 16 September 1844, Mary Ann McMahon. Dixon began writing at an early age, beginning with a play called <span class="italic">The Azamoglan</span>, which was printed privately. Between 1842 and 1846 he wrote for both the <span class="italic">North of England Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Illuminated Magazine</span>. In 1846 he became editor of the <span class="italic">Cheltenham Journal</span>. During his two months as editor he won two principal essay prizes in Madden's <span class="italic">Prize Essay Magazine</span>. Later in the same year he moved to London, where he entered the Inner Temple. He was not called to the bar until 1 May 1854 and never practised law.<br>
<br>After abandoning the law, Dixon began contributing to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, in which he published two series of bold articles, &#145;The literature of the lower orders&#146; and &#145;London prisons&#146;; the latter led to his first serious works, <span class="italic">John Howard and the Prison World of Europe</span> (1849, three editions) and <span class="italic">The London Prisons</span> (1850). At about the same time he was appointed a deputy commissioner of the Great Exhibition of 1851, held at the Crystal Palace in London, and helped to start more than one third of the committees then formed. His <span class="italic">Life of William Penn</span> was published in 1851, and this included answers to Macaulay's charges against Penn. Although Macaulay never responded to this work in print, a copy of Dixon's <span class="italic">Life</span> was found in his possession at his death.<br>
<br>In the same year, during a panic over fears of a French invasion, Dixon published an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The French in England, or, Both Sides of the Question on both Sides of the Channel</span>, which dismissed the possibility. In 1852 he also published a life, <span class="italic">Robert Blake, Admiral and General at Sea, Based on Family and State Papers</span>, which won popular acclaim but was not taken seriously by historians. After a long tour in Europe, in January 1853 he became editor of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>.<br>
<br>In 1854 Dixon began researching the life of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam. He published articles in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1860 and these were republished as <span class="italic">The Personal History of Lord Bacon from Unpublished Papers</span> in 1861. He also published <span class="italic">A Statement of the Facts in Regard to Lord Bacon's Confession</span> (1861) and the <span class="italic">Story of Lord Bacon's Life</span> (1862).<br>
<br>In 1861 Dixon travelled in Portugal, Spain, and Morocco, and edited the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Lady Morgan</span>, who had appointed him her literary executor. In 1863 he travelled in the Middle East, and on his return helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund, of which he eventually became chairman. In 1865 he published <span class="italic">The Holy Land</span>, a guide to the region then known as Palestine. In 1866 he travelled in the United States. During his trip he discovered in the public library at Philadelphia a collection of Irish state papers belonging to the English national archives, which had been missing since the time of James II and included the original manuscript of the memoirs of Ulick Bourke, fifth earl and marquess of Clanricarde, covering 23 October 1641 to 30 August 1643. At his suggestion, they were returned to the British government.<br>
<br>In 1867 Dixon published his <span class="italic">New America</span>, which went through many editions, not only in England, but also in France, Russia, Holland, Italy, and Germany. He also travelled through the Baltic provinces. In 1868 Dixon's controversial work <span class="italic">Spiritual Wives</span> brought accusations of indecency. He brought a libel action against the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, which had made the charge, and obtained nominal damages of 1 farthing on 29 November 1872.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1868 Dixon declined an invitation to stand for Marylebone. Although he spoke at many political meetings, he was not prepared to give up his career as a writer to go into politics. In 1869 he brought out the first two volumes of <span class="italic">Her Majesty's Tower</span> (vols. 3 and 4, 1871). In August 1869 he resigned as editor of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and soon afterwards was appointed justice of the peace for Middlesex and Westminster. In 1869 Dixon travelled for some months in the north, and wrote about his journey in <span class="italic">Free Russia</span> (1870). During that year he was elected a member of the London school board. In direct opposition to Dudley Francis Stuart Ryder, Viscount Sandon, he succeeded in carrying a resolution which established drill in all rate-paid schools in London. He worked hard as a member of the school board during its first three years. He spent most of 1871 in Switzerland, and then published <span class="italic">The Switzers</span> (1872). Shortly afterwards he was sent to Spain on a financial mission by a council of foreign bondholders.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1872 Dixon was created a knight commander of the Crown by the Kaiser Wilhelm. While in Spain he wrote most of his <span class="italic">History of Two Queens</span> (Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn) (1873, 1874). Before starting upon his next journey he began a campaign to open the Tower of London to the public free of charge. He obtained the support of then prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, and on public holidays Dixon personally conducted tours through the buildings. In September 1874 he travelled through Canada and the United States, which he described in <span class="italic">The White Conquest</span> (1875). Later that year he returned to visit Italy and Germany. In the following year he wrote &#145;The way to Egypt&#146; for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, as well as two other articles in which he suggested that the government should purchase from Turkey its Egyptian suzerainty. In 1877 he published his first romance, <span class="italic">Diana, Lady Lyle</span>. The following year he published <span class="italic">Ruby Grey</span> and the first two volumes of his four-volume work <span class="italic">Royal Windsor</span>. A fall from his horse while in Cyprus in 1878 broke his shoulder bone; from then on his health deteriorated. <span class="italic">British Cyprus</span> was published in 1879; he subsequently lost most of his savings, which he had unwisely invested in Turkish stock.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1874 Dixon's house near Regent's Park, 6 St James's Terrace, was completely wrecked by an explosion of gunpowder on the Regent's Canal. He suffered more distress at the death of his eldest daughter and the sudden death at Dublin, on 20 October 1879, of his eldest son, William Jerrold Dixon. He was revising the proof sheets of the concluding volumes of <span class="italic">Royal Windsor</span>, and on Friday 26 December 1879 made a great effort to finish the work. He died in his bed on the following morning from a seizure. On 2 January 1880 he was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Dixon took a leading part in improving accommodation for the poor and labouring classes. He was a popular writer, but his work was sometimes questioned for its accuracy. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and the Pennsylvania Society. His wife survived him. Among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56958/', "Ella Nora Hepworth Dixon")</script>, novelist and journalist.<br>
