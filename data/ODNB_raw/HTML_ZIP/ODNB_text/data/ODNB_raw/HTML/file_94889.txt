<span class="headword">Leach,  Bernard Howell</span>  (1887&#150;1979), <span class="occ">potter and writer</span>, was born on 5 January 1887 in Hong Kong, the only child of Andrew John Leach (1852&#150;1904), barrister and puisne judge, and his wife, Eleanor 
    (known as Nellie; 1862&#150;1887)
  , daughter of Hamilton Sharp of Manchester, headmaster, and his wife.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Three months after the death of his mother, who died while giving birth to Bernard, Leach was taken from Hong Kong to Japan by his maternal grandparents who were travelling to Kyoto to work as missionary teachers. About 1891 his father married a distant cousin of his mother, Jessie Sharp, a devout Catholic, and he came to Japan to take the four-year-old child back to Hong Kong and then to Singapore where Andrew Leach was appointed to the bench in 1894. While devoted to his father, Bernard Leach remembered his childhood as lonely, his only friend being his half-Irish, half-Chinese amah. Relations with his stepmother were difficult, and his father seemed distant and undemonstrative. Although there are no records of any early education Bernard discovered the joys of drawing as a child, spending hours sketching the boats in the harbour. <br>
<br>In 1897, at the age of ten, Leach was taken to England by a great-uncle, travelling across the United States by train, to attend Beaumont Jesuit College on the edge of Windsor Great Park, generally regarded as the &#145;Catholic Eton&#146;. Again he was lonely and isolated, and formed no lasting friendships within the school, an environment he found needlessly severe. While he made little impact academically he did excel in drawing and elocution, for which he was awarded prizes, and made the first eleven at cricket, a sport he continued to enjoy throughout his life. Religious ceremony and sacred music also offered some consolation for his continuing unhappiness. <br>
<br>Since Leach showed no inclination for an academic career in business or law his father reluctantly agreed to allow him at the age of sixteen to enter the Slade School of Fine Art at the University of London. Under the watchful if highly critical eye of Henry Tonks, who was in charge of drawing at the Slade, Leach's graphic skills blossomed, though his ability to handle paint proved elusive. After only three terms his father was diagnosed as having advanced cancer and Leach was forced to leave the Slade and to spend the final few months with his father at his home in Bournemouth. In a desperate bid to please him, Leach made a deathbed promise to enter the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and embark on a respectable and secure career. For a time he studied for his bank examinations in Manchester, staying with his uncle, William Evans Hoyle, director of the Manchester Museum, his aunt Edith (his mother's sister), and their daughter his cousin (Edith) Muriel (1885&#150;1955), with whom he fell in love. Her parents, however, did not approve of the relationship. <br>
<br>After returning to London Leach found work as a junior bank clerk intolerable. In complete despair he lost his belief and never returned to the Roman Catholic faith. Despite the promise made to his father, he resigned from the bank and at the age of twenty-one used his modest inheritance to attend the London School of Art where he came under the powerful influence of Frank Brangwyn who taught him etching. Brangwyn, who had worked for several years in William Morris's workshop, was a keen Japanophile, and may have impressed Bernard with ideas about the relationship between art and craft and with his fascination with Far Eastern culture. The return of his grandparents from Japan, and the vivid images of old Japan described in the accounts of the travels of Lafcadio Hearn, rekindled childhood memories and Leach decided to move to Japan, and try to make a living by teaching etching. His love for his first cousin Muriel had never wavered and eventually family objections were overcome and they made plans to marry in Kyoto. Leach moved to Japan in 1909, and lived in Tokyo; and he and Muriel married there later the same year.<h2>
<a name="MovetoJapan"></a>Move to Japan</h2>Much to his surprise Bernard Leach found it hard to adapt to Japanese life; tall, thin, with a mass of hair and a bushy moustache, he found the rooms were too small for his large frame and sitting cross-legged on the hard floor proved to be a trial. Despite this he had a traditional Japanese house built, although he sought to retain some Western customs by having a central well in the living room fitted with a table so he could avoid sitting cross-legged. He also designed furniture in a mixture of oriental, Western, and arts and crafts styles. Although critical of many aspects of Japanese culture, he was enthralled by the craftwork and the use of traditional techniques, but he felt that in the urge to Westernize many old and valuable customs were being lost or forgotten. His first child, <a href="#cosubject_94889">David Leach [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born in 1911, eventually followed by another boy and three girls. <br>
<br>Unfortunately few Japanese responded to the etching process, and far from finding himself continuing in the role of teacher Leach became a student, eager to learn about a culture that seemed so fundamentally different from anything he had encountered in the West. Through an involvement with a group of progressive young intellectuals known as the Shirekaba (White Birch) he became friends with Soetsu Yanagi, who later established and became director of the Folk Art Museum or Mingei Kan. In an attempt to escape the limits of traditional Japanese life the Shirekaba investigated the spiritual aspects of Western literature, poetry, and painting, and published their ideas in a journal of the same name. Like Leach they were concerned with the impact of industrial modernization, fearing that the values of new Japan would eliminate rather than free the spirit of man. Leach's involvement with the group was largely to introduce the work of European artists and writers such as William Blake and Augustus John. <br>
<br>It was through the Shirekaba that Leach was introduced to the magic of pottery for the first time. Invited to a raku party, he painted a biscuit-fired pot that was then covered with glaze and fired quickly in a small portable charcoal kiln. Enraptured, Leach decided to learn the craft and found an old potter, Urano Shigekichi (then living in the slum area of Tokyo), who held the title Ogata Kenzan VI, for he claimed descent from the poet, painter, and potter the first Kenzan. From Shigekichi, Leach learned the rudiments of pottery, the art of painting on pots, and the techniques of raku and high-fired stoneware and porcelain. Although the convention was to employ a skilled thrower who threw under direction, he acquired limited throwing skills working on a wheel that revolved clockwise, the opposite of Western wheels, a method that he would retain throughout his life. In 1914, prior to a move to Peking (Beijing) in China, Leach held his first one-person show of pots, paintings, fabrics, and furniture in Tokyo and published a book <span class="italic">A Review, 1909&#150;1914</span>. This contained poems, prose pieces, his credo and his belief in the unity of East and West, as well as illustrations of pots and reproductions of etchings. This was the first of a series of books in which he propounded his personal philosophy and aesthetic concepts, most notably in <span class="italic">A Potter's Outlook</span> (1928). <br>
<br>In China, under the influence of the mysterious and rather sinister German Dr Westharp, Leach sought to revive aspects of traditional Chinese teaching methods following the ideas of Maria Montessori. In 1917, realizing the futility of his quest, he and his family returned to Japan, thoroughly disillusioned with the search for social, philosophical, and educational fulfilment, accepting Yanagi's advice that his true vocation was to be a potter. Encouraged by friends he set up a workshop on Yanagi's land at Abiko in Chiba province. When this was totally destroyed by fire Viscount Koroda, a patron of the arts, came to the rescue by building a workshop and kiln for his use and supplying two skilled potters to work under his direction. For his final exhibition before returning to England Leach published another small book with essays by Yanagi and his friend and fellow potter Kenkichi Tomimoto among others.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland"></a>Return to England</h2>To enable his children to have an English education, and assuming that his work would find as enthusiastic a response as it had in Japan, Leach returned to England in 1920, bringing with him Shoji Hamada, a potter who had studied at a technical school in Tokyo. With financial help from a local philanthropist, Frances Horne, Leach set up the Leach Pottery on the outskirts of St Ives, Cornwall, building a large, oriental-type climbing kiln fired with wood, the first of its kind to be built in the West. Despite great technical problems local materials were found and they produced stoneware and porcelain that reflected oriental influence. In a smaller round kiln he fired earthenwares drawing on more Western styles, and also raku. In organizing a workshop and in the sort of pots that were produced the pottery played a pioneering role in establishing an identity for studio potters in the twentieth century. <br>
<br>Early exhibitions of both individual pots and tablewares in London attracted favourable reviews but limited sales, and until the standard range of tableware was introduced the pottery struggled financially. Fortunately regular shipments of pots and drawings to Japan were a continuing success and helped supplement the finances of the pottery at St Ives. Much to Leach's surprise the Japanese preferred earthenware pots with slip-trailed decoration, described by Yanagi as &#145;born not made&#146;, rather than the individual stoneware pieces that more closely emulated oriental wares. <br>
<br>Early students at the pottery included Michael Cardew, Katharine Pleydell-Bouverie, and Norah Braden, and contact with contemporary stoneware potters, who included William Staite Murray, proved useful in discussing technical and aesthetic problems. Several times the pottery teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and was eventually rescued by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst at Dartington who invited Leach to move the pottery to their estate in south Devon. In 1932 a combination of the breakdown of his marriage and worsening financial situation led Bernard to accept the offer and he settled in Dartington, where he set up a small pottery making earthenware, while continuing to operate the Leach Pottery at St Ives. At Dartington Bernard was introduced to the Baha&#146;i faith by the American painter Mark Tobey and in 1940 he proclaimed himself a believer in Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, a faith that strengthened to become more central in his life. On 7 July 1944 he married Laurie Gladys Annie Cookes (1895&#150;1976), who had worked as secretary and helper at the Leach Pottery. <br>
<br>From 1937 Leach's elder son, David, who joined the pottery in 1930, introduced a series of innovations that put the Leach Pottery at St Ives on a more stable footing, converting the kiln from the laborious process of firing with wood to oil, and introducing a range of repetition wheel-thrown tablewares that became known as standard ware. This was fired to high temperature with a white or black glaze on the inside only so that it contrasted pleasantly with the rich, toasted colour of the body. Leach standard ware was made by assistants like Bill Marshall, many of whom remained for many years. Production of standard ware continued until Leach's death, and was regarded by many as setting the classic standard for handmade high-fired pottery, and in time was widely emulated.<h2>
<a name="BeyondEastandWest"></a>Beyond East and West</h2>In 1934 Leach returned to Japan for a fifteen-month visit where he toured country potteries and collected material for <span class="italic">A Potter's Book</span> (1940), by far his most influential text. With its blend of philosophical thoughts on &#145;standards&#146; for studio pottery and sound practical advice on clay bodies, techniques, glazing, and kilns, the book became regarded as the &#145;potter's bible&#146; and is still in print. <br>
<br>Following the Second World War Leach felt confident enough to want to talk about his ideas, successfully touring Scandinavia in 1949, the United States and Canada in 1950, 1952 (with Yanagi and Hamada), and 1961, and later Australia and New Zealand, always accompanied by exhibitions of his pots. In talks, lectures, slide and film shows he advocated the need for work that involved the &#145;head, hand and heart&#146;, that was anti-materialistic and that looked to but did not seek to emulate tradition. An engaging speaker, Leach quickly got the feel of his audience. His manner tended to be conversational rather than declamatory and often involved much waving of arms. He could be generous in his praise though always wary of anything that might be construed as imitative or superficial. Favourite topics in his talks and lectures were based on his personal experience such as his impressions of Japan and his early training. In the alternative society of the 1960s Leach and &#145;life-style&#146; pottery had a great vogue. <br>
<br>Leach continued to make regular visits to Japan, often travelling round the country, making sketches of the landscape, and decorating with lively brushwork pots made to his design at country potteries. On 26 March 1956 he married his third wife, Janet Darnell (1918&#150;1997) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68816/', "Leach, Janet")</script>], an American potter he had first met in the States, who, following David Leach's departure in 1955 to set up his own workshop, took over the running of the Leach Pottery. His pots still received a muted reception in England but in Japan exhibitions of his work sold out almost instantly; in 1967 he was awarded the order of the Sacred Treasure, second class, the highest accolade the country could give to a non-Japanese person. In 1974 the Japanese Foundation awarded him the equivalent of the Nobel prize for services to East&#150;West understanding. Although there was an Arts Council retrospective exhibition &#145;Fifty years a potter&#146; in the council's London gallery in 1961, he was given no further major exhibitions in the UK until 1977 when a large retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum finally brought the full range of his achievements to wide public acclaim. Public honours included freeman of St Ives in 1968, the appointment as a CBE in 1966 and CH in 1974. With failing sight Bernard Leach stopped making and decorating pots in 1973&#150;4, when glaucoma was diagnosed, and he concentrated on writing. A book of his poems, <span class="italic">Drawings, Verse and Belief</span>, published in 1973, expounds the importance of his commitment to the Baha&#146;i faith, and it was followed in 1978 by a book of memoirs <span class="italic">Beyond East and West: Memoirs, Portraits and Essays</span>, a series of autobiographical writings about his life and his views on pottery and religion. Other books included a translation of Yanagi's writings, <span class="italic">The Unknown Craftsman: a Japanese Insight into Beauty</span> (1972), a study of Hamada, <span class="italic">Hamada: Potter</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">Kenzan and his Tradition</span> (1966). Leach died on 6 May 1979 in St Ives, and was buried there in Longstone cemetery.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>In his work as a potter Bernard Leach sought to unite the high-firing processes of oriental wares with a Western understanding, producing bottles, bowls, lidded boxes, and vases in stoneware or porcelain mostly thrown on the wheel. At their best the pots have a powerful sense of form enhanced with minimal decoration, many freely but surely painted or incised. Few pots over 12 inches were produced; most were smaller, so ensuring that their scale was essentially domestic. Preferred colours were muted creams, pale blues and greens, or dark intense glowing blacks and browns, intended to be objects of contemplation and quiet reflection. Some jug forms were based on medieval forms. Leach came closest to traditional English country wares in the range of large earthenware dishes in terracotta that he made in the 1920s and 1930s and again briefly in the early 1950s. Many were decorated with slip patterns, carried out with great freedom and assurance, which included the Mermaid of Zennor, reflecting Cornish folklore, while others offered powerful interpretations of Japanese landscape. <br>
<br>The influence of Bernard Leach, both nationally and internationally, lies in both his writing and his practice as a potter. As an author he attempted to &#145;set standards&#146;, whether in the quality of work made, or in discussing concepts of beauty. Pots were often imbued with human characteristics and references were made to the neck, belly, shoulder, and foot. &#145;The pot is the man&#146; was an oft-repeated maxim used when seeking to assess quality. Following William Morris's ideas, Leach believed that the nature of work affected the person who made it and should be a &#145;joy to the maker and to the user&#146;. Yanagi, who inclined towards Buddhism, introduced Leach to Zen Buddhist concepts and their intimate relationship with aesthetics. Leach attempted to look at the fundamental basis of the religion and how this related to the idea of beauty in pots. As a Western artist he often found the concept of rejecting self in favour of a wider and more anonymous creativity a great challenge. <br>
<br>For the form of his pots, Leach drew heavily on the classic bottle shapes of Korea rather than China or Japan, having seen them at first hand during visits to the country in 1918 and 1935, though always softened and muted rather than austere and sharp. He was a great initiator, more famous and influential than contemporaries such as Charles Vyse or William Staite Murray, partly because he courted publicity and partly because of the widespread success of <span class="italic">A Potter's Book</span> that combined theory and practice with personal experience. Leach saw himself as having a mission in bringing together the cultures of East and West, and to propound the value of hand as opposed to machine work. Following his death in 1979 Leach's reputation went into severe decline. After dominating the world of studio pottery for over fifty years there was a strong reaction against his oriental-inspired aesthetic of sombre tones and eastern forms in favour of more colour and a lighter mood. Leach's own pots also suffered from a series of fakes made in the early 1980s. More recently a large retrospective at the Crafts Council Gallery, London (1997) and a monograph (1999) have begun to offer a more balanced view of Leach and his undoubted position as the most influential figure of twentieth-century studio pottery. <br>
<br>Leach's elder son, <a name="cosubject_94889"></a><span class="headword">David Andrew Leach</span>  (1911&#150;2005), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born on 7 May 1911 in Japan, where (with the exception of a brief interlude with his parents in China) he spent the first nine years of his life, until the family settled in St Ives. He originally hoped to study medicine, but his family could not afford the fees. In 1930 he joined the Leach Pottery, but recognizing his own technical ignorance spent two years studying ceramics at Stoke-on-Trent, much to the disapproval of his father, who referred to it as &#145;the industrial devil&#146;. Luckily David Leach inherited his father's passion for ceramics but not his lack of business sense. He was instrumental in establishing the pottery on a firm financial footing, particularly through the introduction of repetition tablewares, and such other innovations as mail-order catalogues. On 23 April 1938 he married the 25-year-old (Mary) Elizabeth Facey, daughter of Surgeon Commander Samuel Henry Facey RN of Harting, Sussex. They had three sons.<br>
<br>During the Second World War David Leach served with the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry. He then returned to the Leach Pottery, whose growth he continued to nurture. He also helped establish potteries in Norway and at Aylesford in Kent (the latter for the Carmelite friars, in 1954). He began to acquire a reputation for his own pots, particularly after an exhibition at a St Ives art gallery in 1949. In 1955 David and his younger brother Michael left to start their own potteries, David founding Lowerdown Pottery at Bovey Tracey, Devon. There he produced many acclaimed examples of earthenware, and more especially stoneware and porcelain. He was an excellent thrower, and made some beautiful, and often very large, stoneware pots. His development in 1967 of a light, translucent porcelain (later widely used by other potters) enabled him to produce some exquisitely delicate, fluted pots and bowls. His work was acquired by more than forty public collections in Britain alone, and was exhibited in many countries.<br>
<br>David Leach was chairman of the Craftsmen Potters Association of Great Britain in 1967 and won the gold medal of the International Academy of Ceramics the same year. He was also a committed and talented educator. Having spent the year 1953&#150;4 running the pottery department at Loughborough College of Art, he continued teaching there until the mid-1960s. In 1963 he advised Harrow School of Art on its new two-year diploma in studio pottery, and in 1976 he was a key figure in the establishment of the Dartington pottery training workshop. He continued living in Bovey Tracey until his death, on 15 February 2005, at Torbay Hospital, Torquay, of a lower respiratory tract infection. He was survived by his wife of sixty-six years, Elizabeth, and their three sons.<br>
