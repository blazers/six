<span class="headword">Neilson,  Walter Montgomerie</span>  (1819&#150;1889), <span class="occ">railway locomotive manufacturer</span>, was born in Cowcaddens, Glasgow, on 28 November 1819, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19866/', "James Beaumont Neilson (1792&#150;1865)")</script>, engineer and inventor, and his first wife, Barbara Montgomerie (1796&#150;1843). Patent royalties from his father's invention of a process to convert blackband ironstone into pig-iron by introducing a blast of hot air into a furnace enabled the purchase in 1851 of the Queenshill estate in Kirkcudbright, which became the family seat for a century.<br>
<br>From the age of fourteen Walter Neilson attended the Andersonian Institution in Glasgow, where he excelled at technical topics. His father had plans for his eldest son to become, like him, a mechanical engineer and enter the family firm of Neilson and Mitchell, Hydepark Street, Glasgow. He was first apprenticed to the St Rollox foundry at seventeen, but two years later left to continue his apprenticeship at Neilson and Mitchell. In 1843 he became a partner in the family's firm, which under his direction built their first steam locomotive. His technical prowess was demonstrated in September 1849 when he obtained a patent for a &#145;saddle tank&#146; engine design.<br>
<br>Neilson harboured a passion to build locomotives in Scotland and to refocus his firm, from general engineering to specializing in engine manufacture for the country's burgeoning railway companies. He recorded in his memoirs:<blockquote>Seeing the number of Railways that were being made in Scotland and every thing for them got in England I determined to try to get some of the work for Scotland. I engaged William Tait as Foreman over the engine department, more particularly the Railway and Locomotive department in 1844. (Neilson, &#145;Dates and notes&#146;, 17)</blockquote>His vision was realized in 1852 when his firm was dedicated exclusively to manufacturing railway steam engines. He recognized from the outset that competition from established locomotive manufacturers in England would require him to address the export market at the earliest opportunity. Neilson and Mitchell exported their first engine to Cuba in 1852, through the firm's existing links for supplying sugar-cane processing equipment.<br>
<br>Neilson also recognized that in creating a locomotive manufacturing facility he would need to engage experienced staff, who resided in England. Gaining these proved initially to be difficult for him, and he employed James Reid (1823&#150;1894) who had no specialized knowledge. In 1858&#151;after Reid's departure and before he rejoined the firm in 1863 after gaining relevant experience&#151;Neilson employed Henry D&uuml;bs who had experience of locomotive construction and a knowledge of the market for engines in the south. Exports benefited from Neilson's travels to gain knowledge of overseas locomotive practice&#151;he visited the United States in 1856 and was deeply impressed by American engine-building techniques and performance capability&#151;as well as his excellent international reputation as a mechanical engineer (he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1860).<br>
<br>Business growth was sufficiently promising that Neilson purchased land in north-central Glasgow at Springburn, and he moved the firm there in 1862. At the London International Exhibition of April 1862 an &#145;eight-footer&#146; locomotive designed by Benjamin Connor and built by the Neilson firm for the Caledonian Railway was purchased by Sa&#145;id Pasha, viceroy of Egypt, leading to a succession of orders from Egyptian Railways. By 1874 the renamed Neilson &amp; Co. had &pound;61,500 of unfinished contracts in hand for locomotives to be delivered to railway companies in England, Scotland, Ulster, Italy, and India. By the second half of the 1870s Neilson &amp; Co. employed 1500 men and produced 120 engines a year. It supplied markets from the Argentine to New Zealand, enjoying a reputation for building locomotives to order for demanding requirements&#151;especially huge articulated locomotives for export.<br>
<br>Despite these achievements Walter Neilson lost the family firm in a lingering dispute with James Reid, who had succeeded Henry D&uuml;bs as manager in 1863. On reappointment Reid received a ten-year contract as a partner, with a clause to buy out Neilson at the end of this period. When a decade later he was prepared to leave the business, Neilson disputed the contract terms. He understood that old machinery and tools (which had been transferred to Springburn from the Hydepark works) would be negotiated separately from the purchase price of the works. An arbitrator named in the contract&#151;whom Neilson disliked and claimed was biased against him&#151;was brought in to value the entire firm, and the valuation led to further acrimony. Despite an impasse Neilson left the family firm in 1876. The parting was far from amicable as, in his view, he had been deserted by his family lawyer and let down by the arbiter. Consequently he felt that the enterprise he had created &#145;was given away to Mr. Reid for a mere nothing&#146;.<br>
<br>This blow for Neilson was compounded in the following year by the death in childbirth of his wife, Janet Ellen Henderson (1841&#150;1877), of Leghorn, Italy, whom he had married on 14 March 1867. They had a son and a daughter. His wife's family had shipping connections in Italy, and provided him with business contacts. A devout presbyterian, who supported the Free Church of Scotland both financially and as an active elder, Neilson purchased an estate in Tuscany to ensure that members of the (protestant) Waldensian movement in Italy, on leaving their traditional home at Torre Pellice in the Cottian Alps, would find employment and pastoral care without being scattered across the country. His other activities outside business included membership of the volunteer forces, in which he achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1873, before resigning in 1874. In 1861 he became a freemason, and he served as provincial grand master of Glasgow between 1873 and 1880. He inherited the Queenshill estate on his father's death in 1865.<br>
<br>Neilson recorded that he had had little time for relaxation and, indeed, he never retired. In 1884, at the age of sixty-five, he founded the Clyde locomotive works in Springburn sited, poignantly, across the railway tracks from the firm still carrying his family name that he had left eight years before. His second enterprise never thrived, largely due to fierce competition from domestic and overseas engine builders, and in 1888 he sold out to Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co. of Manchester, who relocated to Glasgow, which was becoming the centre for locomotive manufacturing in Britain. Within months of the sale he died, at Villa Bethanie, Florence, on 8 July 1889. His body was brought to Scotland and buried in the family mausoleum in Tongland kirkyard, Kirkcudbright, near Queenshill.<br>
<br>Walter Neilson was largely responsible for creating Glasgow's worldwide reputation for steam locomotive production. Through his endeavours he attracted skilled designers and works managers, some of whom went on to found locomotive enterprises themselves, thereby increasing the local manufacturing base and bringing employment and prosperity to Springburn. In 1903 three Glasgow firms, Neilson, Reid &amp; Co. (again renamed), D&uuml;bs &amp; Co., and Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co., merged to form the North British Locomotive Company, which traded until 1962. Its railway engines were one of Scotland's greatest engineering and commercial achievements: 28,000 locomotives were built, 18,000 of which went for export. Neilson's enterprising vision laid the foundation for this industrial success, and his name should be revered as a giant of the Scottish industrial revolution.<br>
