<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Joseph Havelock</span>  (1858&#150;1929), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born in Sunderland on 16 August 1858, the son of John Blenkin Wilson, a foreman draper, and his wife, Hannah Robson. After intermittent attendance at a local school and various short-term jobs, Wilson went to sea in 1870, remaining in the merchant marine until 1882. On 30 March 1879 he married Jane Ann Whatham from South Shields; they had two sons and one daughter. Together they ran a temperance hotel in Sunderland from 1884. This establishment became the meeting-place of a local seamen's trade society, of which Wilson assumed the presidency. In 1887, however, impatient with the failure of his fellow officials to expand the organization, he set up the National Amalgamated Sailors' and Firemen's Union. In 1889&#150;90, amid the rash of strikes accompanying the emergence of the &#145;new unions&#146;, he briefly achieved his ambition of forming branches in all major ports.<br>
<br>Wilson hoped to secure recognition for the union from shipowners across the country, in order to regulate employment (restricting that of foreign seamen) and to fix uniform standards of pay and conditions. His belligerent rhetoric and indiscriminate advocacy of sympathetic strikes served only to reinforce the hostility of employers, the great majority of whom were attached, after 1890, to the Shipping Federation. This body conducted a counter-attack which destroyed Wilson's union by 1894, and rendered its successor, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union (NSFU), almost nugatory. The limited improvements which Wilson secured in the safety and comfort of seamen over the next fifteen years were due primarily to the part which he played, in association with Samuel Plimsoll MP, in amending the merchant shipping bills of 1894 and 1906, and extending other industrial legislation to seamen. His faith in a combative tactic was partly justified by the successful waterfront strikes of 1911. But it was not until 1917 that, thanks to the artificial labour shortages resulting from the First World War, centralized collective bargaining was introduced through the National Maritime Board.<br>
<br>After the war, Wilson determined to preserve these gains. He endeared himself to the shipowners by his denunciations of unofficial strikes, by keeping his organization out of the general strike in 1926, and by insisting that wages and working hours must take account of economic depression and international competition. In return, he was allowed negotiating rights and closed-shop arrangements which largely extinguished opposition from small rival unions and rank-and-file dissidents. His control over his own society was strengthened by an arbitrary personal power to hire and fire officials. His policies, however, entailed a growing isolation within the labour movement, culminating in the disaffiliation of the NSFU by the Trades Union Congress in 1928.<br>
<br>Even in his militant years, Wilson remained a Liberal in politics. He gained a parliamentary seat at Middlesbrough in 1892 as an &#145;independent labour&#146; candidate, and held the seat from 1892 to 1895 and from 1906 to 1910 against Conservative and socialist opponents. His dislike of the Labour Party seems to have reflected distaste for the discipline imposed on its adherents. If later Wilson moved to the right, it was because he thought Labour was shifting leftwards. During the war he expressed antipathy for &#145;defeatist&#146; politicians, instructing his members to arrest the passage of Ramsay MacDonald and Fred Jowett, of the Independent Labour Party, to meet foreign socialists, including Germans, in 1917. He was one of the principal supporters of the pro-war British Workers' League, and joined in the attempt to prise the TUC away from the Labour Party in 1917&#150;18. His attachment to Lloyd George enabled him to represent South Shields as a Coalition Liberal from 1918 to 1922. He attributed much of the industrial unrest of the post-war years to Bolshevik influence, refused to assist the miners' lock-out of 1921, and gave financial support to the &#145;non-political&#146; unions in the coalfields after 1926.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1920s Wilson behaved more like an American union boss than a British labour leader. This should not be allowed to obscure the high reputation he had enjoyed in labour circles before 1914, when he had for long championed the cause of combination among seamen almost unaided. His resolute spirit, forensic talent, energy, and adaptability were widely acknowledged. Wilson was appointed CBE in 1917, and became CH in 1922. He retained a seat on the TUC parliamentary committee between 1890 and 1898 despite his union's weakness. His experiences fostered the belief, however, that organization among seamen was intrinsically fragile, and he had little capacity for co-operating closely with anyone who was not a client or a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. His growing ill health increased his remoteness, yet he never relinquished his position of command. He died at his home, 5 Westminster Bridge Road, Southwark, London, on 16 April 1929. He was survived by his wife.<br>
