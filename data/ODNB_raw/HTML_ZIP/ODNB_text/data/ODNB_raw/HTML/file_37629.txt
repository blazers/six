<span class="headword">Kempe,  Charles Eamer</span>  (1837&#150;1907), <span class="occ">artist in stained-glass and church decoration</span>, was born on 29 June 1837 at Ovingdean Hall, Sussex, the fifth son and seventh and last child of Nathaniel Kemp JP, who died when his son was six, and his second wife, Augusta Caroline, the daughter of Sir John Eamer, a former lord mayor of London. Kempe (he added the &#145;e&#146; in the 1860s) was educated at Rugby School, and Pembroke College, Oxford (MA 1862).<br>
<br>A severe stammer prevented his taking holy orders, and Kempe determined to devote his Anglo-Catholic fervour to the cause of ecclesiastical art. He gained practical experience and made designs for embroidery and furniture in the office of the young G. F. Bodley, son of the Kemp family physician, and a leading figure in the later phase of the Gothic revival in architecture. He studied briefly in the London stained-glass studios of Clayton and Bell, and in 1866 set up his own business in stained-glass and church decoration. Three years later he received his first major commission, to decorate Bodley's new church of St John, Tue Brook, Liverpool.<br>
<br>Thereafter Kempe's business prospered, and his work graces many cathedrals, including those in Wells, Lichfield, Southwark, Winchester, Durham, Gloucester, Canterbury, and York Minster. Of his many foreign commissions one of the most prestigious was the window ordered in 1877 by Princess Alice, grand-duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, for the royal mausoleum in Darmstadt, in commemoration of the death of her young son.<br>
<br>In 1875 Kempe bought an Elizabethan house, Old Place, Lindfield, Sussex, which he greatly enlarged and decorated lavishly with his growing collection of furniture and works of art. Although he is often characterized as retiring and eccentric, he entertained distinguished visitors in style, and studio staff were frequently welcomed to Old Place and treated with considerable generosity.<br>
<br>Never more than competent as a draughtsman himself, Kempe was adept at selecting and training young designers and craftsmen to carry out schemes under his direction. His early work was inspired by English fifteenth-century glass, and he was a pioneer in his appreciation of late medieval styles. By 1880 he was turning to German models, and as business increased (he is believed to have employed as many as a hundred men) production became stereotyped. In 1882 the eighteen-year-old (John) Ninian Comper was Kempe's pupil and already anticipated the view of most subsequent critics with his preference for Kempe's early work.<br>
<br>Kempe died, unmarried, at his home, 28 Nottingham Place, London, on 29 April 1907, and was buried in the family vault at Ovingdean. The business passed to his cousin, Walter E. Tower, and the weak derivatives of the Kempe formula produced until the studio's demise in 1934 did little to advance Kempe's reputation. Yet his role in the advancement of late nineteenth-century art and architecture was an important one. His adaptations of late Gothic and northern Renaissance styles were influential and had many admirers. That he had established an alternative path to Pre-Raphaelite styles was recognized by W. Owen Chadwick, who suggested in <span class="italic">The Victorian Church</span> (1966) that &#145;the art of stained glass reached its zenith, not with the innovations of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, but in the tractarian artist, Charles Eamer Kempe&#146;.<br>
