<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Ernest Hubert Francis</span>  (1909&#150;1969), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 29 March 1909 at 167 Tredworth Road, Gloucester, the eldest son of Hubert Charles Baldwin, organist and music teacher, and of his wife, Nellie Victoria Baldwin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hailes. He was educated at the Crypt Grammar School, Gloucester, and St John's College, Cambridge (1928&#150;30), where he was a prize and open exhibitioner. He obtained a first in both parts of the natural sciences tripos, including part two in biochemistry. After this he obtained various scholarships, including being a senior student of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 (1933&#150;5), which enabled him to remain in the Cambridge department of biochemistry. In 1933 he married Pauline Mary Edwards, daughter of Walter Bushby Edwards, with whom he had one daughter, Nicola, and one son, Nigel St John. Baldwin was a fellow of St John's (1936&#150;41). From 1936 to 1943 he was university demonstrator and subsequently he became lecturer in biochemistry (1943&#150;50).<br>
<br>During his time in Cambridge Baldwin was influenced by Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins's wide approach to biochemistry and applied himself to the comparative aspects of the subject, in particular, to the study of nitrogen metabolism and the phosphagens. He collaborated with such eminent biochemists as Joseph Needham and Dorothy Needham, and published a number of papers jointly with them. In 1937 he published a small book, <span class="italic">Comparative Biochemistry</span>, which became a classic introduction to the subject and went into four editions. During his time at Cambridge he acquired wide recognition as a gifted teacher; he had a sense of the modern and was a stimulating lecturer. During the Second World War much of the burden of the teaching of biochemistry in Cambridge fell on him. One result was the publication in 1947 of his <span class="italic">Dynamic Aspects of Biochemistry</span>, which in many respects was the first textbook of modern biochemistry. It gave a new and lucid interpretation of the metabolic interactions within the body and helped to take biochemistry from the thrall of natural-product chemistry on the one hand and physiological chemistry on the other, giving it a status of its own. The book received worldwide acclaim and over the years was translated into many languages and ran into five editions. The second edition (1952) was awarded the Cortina Ulisse prize.<br>
<br>In 1950 Baldwin was appointed to the chair of biochemistry at University College, London, where he developed the new first-degree course in biochemistry, an innovation for the University of London, and helped to oversee the move of his department into new, purpose-built accommodation. Baldwin continued his work on comparative biochemistry and, with collaborators, added much to our knowledge of nitrogen metabolism and the relation between ureotelic metabolism and water shortage. In this work he was as much or more regarded abroad than at home, as witnessed by his appointment as visiting professor at the University of California (1956&#150;7), and as Rose Morgan professor in the University of Kansas (1965). In 1962 he published a slim volume, <span class="italic">The Nature of Biochemistry</span>, intended to give senior-school pupils a feel for biochemistry. It went into two editions and was translated into a number of languages. His memoir of Gowland Hopkins was published in the same year. During his time in Cambridge and London Baldwin also published numerous scientific papers, most of them on aspects of comparative biochemistry.<br>
<br>Baldwin was a tall, slightly stooped figure, bearded, and with a quizzical expression. He was an accomplished pianist and, with his family, an able presenter of theatrical puppets. Always amiable, he was fond of giving sherry parties for his staff and students alike. He suffered from the genetic condition myotonic muscular dystrophy and his later years were dogged by frequent bouts of illness. He died suddenly of congestive heart failure at his home, 8 Crofters Road, Moor Park, Northwood, Middlesex, on 7 December 1969; his body was cremated at the Breakspear crematorium, Rickmansworth. He was survived by his wife.<br>
