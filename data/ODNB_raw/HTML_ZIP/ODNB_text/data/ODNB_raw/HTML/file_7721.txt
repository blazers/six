<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobson,  William Charles Thomas</span>  (1817&#150;1898), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 8 December 1817, the son of John Dobson, an English merchant, and a German mother. While Dobson's early years are obscure, it appears that financial concerns necessitated the family's move to London in 1826. Dobson's artistic training began under Edward Opie, the nephew of the portrait painter John Opie, and included diligent study in the gallery of antiquities at the British Museum by the age of fourteen. In 1836 Dobson entered the Royal Academy Schools and made sufficient progress to attract the attention and active encouragement of the academician and future president Charles Lock Eastlake. Dobson exhibited his work at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1842 and was soon appointed to a prominent position in the School of Design, recently established at Somerset House.<br>
<br>In 1843 Dobson was appointed headmaster of the Government School of Design in Birmingham, a post which he resigned after two years in order to further his artistic training in Italy, particularly in Rome. In 1846 Dobson sent a genre piece entitled <span class="italic">The Young Italian Goatherd</span> to the Royal Academy exhibition to advertise his Italianate training. He then made a less conventional choice and travelled to his native Germany, where he acquainted himself with the Nazarene school of painting, which may have given him the confidence to enter the 1847 Westminster Hall competition with two cartoons, <span class="italic">Lamentation</span> and <span class="italic">Boadicea</span>. While the precise length and timing of his continental sojourn is uncertain, Dobson exhibited a number of fanciful subjects such as <span class="italic">Saul with the Witch of Endor</span> in the 1848 Royal Academy exhibition, and <span class="italic">The Knight Huldbrand Relating his Adventures in the Enchanted Forest</span> in 1849, which sought to capitalize on his German experience.<br>
<br>Possibly recognizing the limited appeal of such works, Dobson began to focus on religious subjects, which firmly established his reputation in the Victorian art world. One of his greatest successes was <span class="italic">The Almsdeeds of Dorcas</span> (1855; Royal Collection) which was purchased by Queen Victoria as a present for Prince Albert on his birthday. Dobson's religious paintings combined the Raphaelesque roundness and finish of William Dyce and Charles Lock Eastlake with the &#145;primitive&#146; backgrounds of the Nazarenes. About 1854 Dobson had at least one painting student, Edward Poynter, who would become a highly celebrated neo-classical painter. Dobson returned to Germany, residing from approximately 1858 to 1860 in Dresden, where he again sought to master the techniques and styles of German painting. In 1860 one critic wrote,<blockquote>We cannot afford to see such a painter spending even a portion of his time upon the heads of little children, beautiful as these pictures are; nor can we desire to find, as some of his latest pictures have shown, the influence of the German school pervading his works. Mr Dobson has been passing several months recently in Dresden; we shall look with some anxiety to see what effect has been produced by his residence there. (Dafforne, 139)</blockquote>In 1878 Dobson served as a juror for the fine art department of the Paris Universal Exhibition, where he exhibited watercolour drawings. Throughout his career Dobson helped to bridge British and continental art.<br>
<br>Dobson did not entirely give up secular subjects, and, as the above critic notes, was well known for his idealized depictions of children. From his sentimental genre subjects to his most ambitious religious paintings, children were prevalent in Dobson's work, and they were central to his moral message of purity and innocence.<br>
<br>Dobson turned relatively late to watercolour, motivated by the desire to preserve it from the corrupting influences of body colour. Dobson attempted to preserve David Cox's transparent wash tradition, and this technical conservatism again allied him with the Nazarenes. This conservative tendency also applied to his oil painting technique where he used a restricted palette of ten pigments which went back to Sir Joshua Reynolds's working method. Dobson was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1870 and a full member in 1875. Dobson was also a member of the Etching Club, founded in 1842.<br>
<br>Based on his success as a painter of religious art, Dobson was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1860 and a full academician in 1872. Exhibiting 117 pictures at the Royal Academy over the course of a fifty-two-year career, Dobson retired from the academy in 1895; he was apparently well liked by his colleagues. A resident of Langham Chambers, Oxford Street, London, by 1858, Dobson had by 1884 acquired a country house, Gentils, Lodsworth, near Petworth, Sussex. He died at Undercliff House, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 30 January 1898. He left a widow, Caroline, and a son, Edmund Arthur Dobson.<br>
