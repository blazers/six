<span class="headword">Dove,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1664/5), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Henry Dove (<i>d</i>. 1616), mayor of Salisbury at the time of his death. John Dove was married with four children, but little else is known of his family. Perhaps a brewer by trade, he was an alderman of Salisbury and served as mayor in 1635. A zealous parliamentarian, he was elected MP for Salisbury in 1645 in place of the town recorder, Robert Hyde, an ejected royalist who was also a personal enemy. With his brother Francis (mayor in 1645 and 1650), Dove served on the Wiltshire county committee and most subsequent militia and assessment commissions. As an MP he was nominated to several parliamentary committees but took no part in the king's trial beyond attending when the sentence was agreed, on 26 January 1649. He also amassed considerable wealth, purchasing the manors of Fountell in Hampshire, Blewbury, Berkshire, and Winterbourne Earls, Wiltshire, from the sales of bishops' lands, plus other lands in Wiltshire. He was named colonel of foot in the Wiltshire militia on 10 August 1650. On 25 August 1651 the council of state commended him for his zeal in raising the militia against Charles II.<br>
<br>Dove was chosen high sheriff of the county in 1655, the year of the abortive royalist rising. On 14 March, Sir Joseph Wagstaffe, Colonel John Penruddock, and some 150 men entered Salisbury early in the morning, and seized Dove, Chief Justice Rolle, and Lord Nicholas, who were there for the county assizes. After the royal proclamation had been read Wagstaffe proposed hanging both judges and the sheriff on the spot. This violent proposal was overruled by the local gentry but Dove, for refusing to read the proclamation, was reserved for future punishment. He was carried to Yeovil, but after two days was allowed to return on parole to Salisbury, where he found that Major Boteler had freed the city. Dove's actions immediately afterwards graphically illustrated his vindictive and grasping nature. On 29 March he asked Thurloe that only those of the &#145;honest and well-affected party&#146; be allowed to serve on juries to try the rebels  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 3.319). Later, sixty-three citizens of Salisbury petitioned for clemency for a condemned rebel, John Lucas, who had intervened to save Dove's life. Lambert, Disbrowe, and Rous were sent to discuss this with Dove, but Lucas was duly hanged. When another rebel, Hugh Grove, was beheaded at Exeter on 14 May, he called from the scaffold for God to forgive, among others, &#145;Mr Dove and the rest for so falsely and maliciously swearing against me&#146;  (Hoare, 17&#150;18); perhaps significantly, Dove had been granted Grove's sequestered estate at Chisenbury Priors in 1650.<br>
<br>In September 1656 both Doves were listed among the aldermen and assistants to be removed from the corporation when the new charter reduced the numbers, their presbyterian faction having been outflanked by radicals. He took his seat in the restored Rump in 1659, while the recent borough charter was replaced by the old one in August of that year. At the Restoration Dove made an abject submission and was allowed to depart unpunished. He and his brother were still aldermen in 1662, when the <span class="roman">Act for the Well Governing and Regulating of Corporations</span> removed them. He retired to his estate at Ivy Church, Alderbury, Wiltshire, where he died between October 1664, when his will was made, and March 1665 when it was proved.<br>
