<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gold,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">astrophysicist</span>, was born on 22 May 1920 in Vienna, Austria, the son of Max Gold, a wealthy industrialist and a director of Austria's largest mining company, and his wife, Josefine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin, a former child actress. His early childhood was spent in a privileged environment, and it seemed natural that he would follow his father into business. However, the steep economic downturn in Europe at the end of the 1920s threatened the mining industry, so the family moved to Berlin, where his father took a more secure position as a metals trader. In 1933, after Hitler's rise to power, the family left Germany, Gold's father being Jewish, to spend four years travelling through Europe before settling in England in 1937. Gold was educated at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz in Switzerland, where he boarded. He then moved to England, where he spent one year learning Latin so that he could matriculate at the University of Cambridge. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1939 to read mechanical sciences, but received little teaching because within weeks the university was drained of its academic staff, who had been swiftly drafted into war work.<br>
<br>Hitler's rapid advance in Belgium and France in May 1940 led on 12 May to the internment of all men of German or Austrian descent who were resident in eastern England. Thus it was that Tommy Gold and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96022/', "Hermann Bondi")</script> (who had also fled Vienna) met behind barbed wire on a concrete floor, and immediately became good friends. They were transferred to a camp in Canada for several months, then released to return to Cambridge in 1941, where Gold completed his engineering degree, gaining a miserable result, an ordinary degree, in June 1942. By this stage Bondi had joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76123/', "Fred Hoyle")</script> on radar research for the Royal Navy. Bondi pressed Hoyle to hire Gold as a practically minded member of Hoyle's theory group. Thereafter Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold shared a rented house where they whiled away their evenings working speculatively in astrophysics. An unlikely chain of events that had commenced in 1933 led to Gold becoming an innovative scientist, rather than the entrepreneur his father had intended.<br>
<br>Gold quickly became an indispensable member of Hoyle's group, working on how the state of the sea affected the radar visibility for aircraft-mounted radar. He then solved the problem of how a large number of landing craft could accurately navigate by radar to their correct landing spots on D-day. His greatest contribution to the naval intelligence service was his discovery in early 1944 that the German navy was fitting snorkels to many of its submarines, enabling them to recharge their batteries without surfacing. He worked in naval intelligence until 1947, when he returned to Cambridge as a junior research fellow at Trinity College. The same year he married Merle Eleanor Tuberg, an American astrophysicist; they had three daughters, Linda, Lucy, and Tanya. That marriage was dissolved, and in 1972 he married Carvel B. Beyer, with whom he had a fourth daughter, Lauren.<br>
<br>In 1948 Gold, Bondi, and Hoyle proposed a new theory about the origin of the universe, which they named steady-state cosmology. Gold's contribution was in the setting of an intellectual puzzle: what properties would the universe need to have if its overall appearance were to remain approximately the same in all locations and at all epochs? Gold knew that such a model would require the continuous creation of matter in order to fill the voids left by the expansion of the universe. In the UK this steady-state cosmology seized the imagination of the general public, although it was never taken seriously in professional circles, despite the vociferous advocacy of its three proponents. With the discovery, in 1963, of cosmic microwave background radiation the rival big bang theory became the consensus cosmology, despite which Gold never lost his faith in steady-state cosmology.<br>
<br>Gold's interests always ranged widely, encompassing physiology, astronomy, geophysics, and engineering. The department of physics at Cambridge found this broad spectrum attractive, and had appointed him a demonstrator in 1949. This brought him into direct contact with Martin Ryle, head of the radio group at Cambridge, with whom Hoyle was already conducting furious public arguments. Gold rather unwisely joined the fray on Hoyle's side, loudly criticizing Ryle for the latter's belief that cosmic radio sources are stars in the Milky Way, rather than extragalactic objects. Gold's undisciplined behaviour led to his modest appointment not being renewed, and his future did not look promising. Nevertheless his luck changed remarkably when the astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, offered him the prestigious post of chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which had moved out of London to Herstmonceux on the Sussex coast. There Gold was given a free hand, and he moved into the new field of space research. He took the first steps in subject areas that would hold his attention: the nature of the lunar surface, and solar&#150;terrestrial relations. An opportunity to organize an expedition to watch an eclipse deepened his interest in the action of magnetic fields in space, and the ejection of high-energy particles in solar flares. In 1959 he coined the expression &#145;magnetosphere&#146; for the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles.<br>
<br>Gold resigned abruptly from the Royal Observatory in 1956, on finding that he could not work with the new astronomer royal, Richard Woolley. He had earlier taken the precaution of visiting several centres for astronomical research in the USA, which led to an invitation to spend a semester at Cornell. Consequently Gold and his wife left England for good in 1956. Harvard offered him a chair in radio astronomy in 1957. However, he and his family could not settle in Massachusetts, so when, in 1959, Cornell offered him the headship of its department of astronomy he accepted. This was his final move. At Cornell he founded, and directed for twenty-two years, the Center for Radio Physics and Space Research, the world's first institute dedicated to space research. He and his Cornell colleagues persuaded the US Defense Department to fund the construction of a giant radio telescope to observe the ionosphere. First operated in 1963, this instrument, located near Arecibo in Puerto Rico, was the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.<br>
<br>During preparations in the late 1960s for a lunar landing Gold became embroiled in controversy by asserting that a thick layer of dust on the lunar surface could pose a threat to astronauts. He had made no detailed calculations, but incautiously remarked that the dust could be several metres thick. This caused panic at NASA: a robotic craft was dispatched to check that the risk was small in the designated landing zone. Relations between NASA and Gold subsequently improved, and he served with distinction on NASA's science advisory committee. He strenuously opposed manned space flight programmes, and the development of the shuttle, on the grounds that robotic instruments could deliver the science at much lower cost.<br>
<br>The discovery of pulsars by the radio astronomy group at Cambridge in 1968 excited worldwide interest: what were these extraordinary objects? Ironically, when opposing Ryle seventeen years earlier, Gold had worked on the properties of small stars with very strong magnetic fields, and had suggested they would emit intense radiation. For him it was a small step to suggest that a pulsar is a rotating neutron star, an object the properties of which he had already predicted. His paper on this model was refused at the first international conference on pulsars, but the journal <span class="italic">Nature</span> published it immediately. Gold predicted that radio astronomers should be able to detect pulsars with shorter periods than when first discovered, and he concluded that a pulsar would slow down over time as it loses its rotational energy. Both predictions were quickly confirmed by the Arecibo telescope, with the discovery of a pulsar with a period of 0.033 seconds in the Crab nebula. Gold's success encouraged theorists, most notably Stephen Hawking, to work on even more extreme objects, black holes.<br>
<br>Gold became deeply fascinated by the origin of petroleum, a topic he had first pondered in the early 1950s, when he suggested a possible abiogenic cause. In 1980 he speculated that fossil fuels are not fossil at all, but rather that they are the result of the constant upwelling of hydrocarbons from deep below the earth's surface, where they have been trapped since our planet's formation 4.5 billion years ago. His conclusion was that the human race could meet its energy needs for thousands of years by the simple expedient of drilling ever more deeply. These speculations earned him the derision of geophysicists. Nevertheless he remained convinced, and in 1999 he elaborated further by suggesting that the biological markers present in petroleum have arisen from biological action on primordial methane, and that they are not evidence for a biological origin for petroleum.<br>
<br>Gold's many honours included being made a fellow of the Royal Society (1964), a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1974), and a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1974), and he was a recipient of the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985). He suffered a heart attack in 1985, and officially retired the following year. He died on 22 June 2004 at Cayuga Medical Center, Ithaca, New York, of heart disease, and was survived by his wife, Carvel, and his four daughters.<br>
