<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomas,  (William) Miles Webster</span>, Baron Thomas  (1897&#150;1980), <span class="occ">motor company and airline executive</span>, was born on 2 March 1897 at Garfield Villa, Cefn Mawr, near Ruabon, Denbighshire, north Wales, the son of William Henry Thomas, retired furniture dealer and restorer, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (Polly), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Webster, of farming stock from Derbyshire. William Thomas died of bronchitis shortly after the birth of his only child, leaving his widow to bring up her son on the slender income from the letting of small houses constructed by her late husband in Ruabon, eked out by help from her two brothers. Thomas was educated at Acrefair village school, Ruabon grammar school, and Bromsgrove public school. In 1913 he combined night classes at Birmingham University with a local engineering apprenticeship at Bellis and Morcom Ltd, engineers, of Birmingham.<br>
<br>In August 1914 Thomas enlisted as a private, served in the German East African campaign in armoured cars, transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, learned to fly, was commissioned and, in 1916, became an instructor at the Air Fighting School at Heliopolis. In 1917&#150;18 he saw active service as a pilot with 72 squadron in Mesopotamia, Persia, and southern Russia, and was awarded a DFC. In 1919 he resigned from the RAF to join Temple Press Ltd to become technical editor of <span class="italic">The Motor</span> and, in 1922, editor of the <span class="italic">Light Car</span>, at &pound;650 a year.<br>
<br>In January 1924 W. R. Morris (later Lord Nuffield) invited Thomas to join him at Morris Motors, Cowley, as commercial adviser. Six months later, on 2 June 1924, at Littlemore church, Oxford, he married Hylda Church, who had been Morris's secretary. A daughter, Sheila, was born in March 1925 and a son, Michael, in the autumn of 1926.<br>
<br>Working closely with &#145;the Boss&#146;, Thomas advanced rapidly through the Morris Motors hierarchy: sales manager and a director in 1927, general manager and a director of Morris Commercial Cars Ltd, Birmingham, in 1934, and of Wolseley Motors Ltd in 1937, vice-chairman and managing director of Morris Motors and its subsidiary companies in 1940 (he held these posts until 1947), chairman of the Cruiser Tank Production Group, a member of the advisory panel on tank production in 1941, and chairman of the British tank engine mission to the USA in 1942, by which time his income had reached &pound;20,000 a year. He was knighted in 1943.<br>
<br>After the Second World War Sir Miles, while president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, joined the board of the Colonial Development Corporation. That precipitated a growing disharmony with Lord Nuffield and a parting, in 1948, on generous terms. Almost at once he was invited by Lord Nathan, minister of civil aviation, to become deputy chairman of the state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), and to succeed Sir Harold Hartley as chairman from 1 July 1949 at &pound;7500 a year. So began eight years of hard but enjoyable toil and travel. Under Miles Thomas, BOAC became the world's first operator of jet aircraft&#151;the DH Comet&#151;and earned its first profits in 1952, with reduced staff numbers, while doubling its traffic. A natural communicator, Thomas raised staff morale and public pride in BOAC as one of the world's leading airlines.<br>
<br>In 1954 disasters to two Comets and the grounding of the Comet fleet, together with the loss of a Constellation and a Stratocruiser, brought heavy burdens on chairman and airline alike, further compounded in December 1955 when Sir Miles and the new minister of transport and civil aviation, Harold Watkinson, fell out over management responsibilities. In consequence, Sir Miles resigned from BOAC on 30 April 1956, with an offer of the chairmanship of the UK subsidiary of the large United States Monsanto Chemical Company.<br>
<br>During eight more comfortable years, and a salary back at more than &pound;20,000 a year, Sir Miles was able to add a number of other board appointments, including Sun Life, the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and Carbon Electric Holdings Ltd. In 1957 he purchased Remenham Court, Henley-on-Thames, and returned to the air transport industry as the non-executive chairman of Britannia Airways&#151;a substantial charter company. President of the National Savings Committee from 1965 to 1972 and its chairman in 1965&#150;70, Miles Thomas was created a life peer in 1971, as Baron Thomas of Remenham. He died at his home, Remenham Court, Henley-on-Thames, on 8 February 1980 at the age of eighty-two.<br>
