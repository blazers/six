</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Forte,  Charles</span>, Baron Forte  (1908&#150;2007), <span class="occ">caterer and hotelier</span>, was born on 26 November 1908 in the hamlet of Mortale, outside the village of Casalaticco, in an area of Italy known as the Ciociaria, the eldest son of Rocco Giovanni Forte and his wife, Maria Luigia, daughter of Michelangelo Antonio Forte. His parents were distantly related. The name of his birthplace was altered in his honour from Mortale to Monforte some eighty years later. People from the Ciociaria had been settling in Scotland since the 1880s; in 1911 Rocco Forte joined his brother and cousin, who had several small shops there. He opened a business, the Savoy Caf&eacute; in Alloa, that boasted the earliest American soda fountain and Italian espresso coffee-machine in Clackmannanshire. In 1913 Rocco's wife with her adored eldest child joined him there. The five-year-old had hitherto been called Carmine Forte, but his forename was soon Anglicized. He was educated in Alloa, briefly at a boarding-school run by Marist fathers in Dumfries, then at Collegio Scheppers and the Liceo Mamiami in Rome. In 1926 he took a six-month course in accountancy and bookkeeping in Scotland.<br>
<br>Forte first worked in an ice-cream parlour and sandwich bar in Weston-super-Mare, which his father owned with two cousins, and then in his father's caf&eacute;s in Bournemouth and Weymouth. In 1929 he became manager of the Venetian Lounge in Brighton, which his father had started in partnership with another cousin. In 1935 he opened his own milk-bar adjacent to Regent Street Polytechnic in London, and began serving a novelty called milkshakes. Failing to draw enough passers-by, he decided that he needed more conspicuous premises but lower costs. Accordingly he sacked three staff, and extended into an abutting shop. Thereafter he always understood that the sites of his enterprises were decisive to their success, and never relented in his strict costing. The Mayfair property dealers Howard and Basil Samuel helped him to find good sites for further milk-bars in Charing Cross Road, Oxford Street, and Leicester Square. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Forte had nine milk-bars in central London, and was saving 20 per cent on buying costs by supplying them from centralized premises where cakes, sandwiches, and fruit syrups were prepared.<br>
<br>When Italy entered the conflict as an axis ally in 1940, Forte was briefly interned as an enemy national on the Isle of Man. In January 1943 he married Irene Mary (1920/21&#150;2010), only daughter of Olga Chierico, a redoubtable Venetian widow who ran a delicatessen in Soho; her long-dead husband had been Giovanni Chierico. They had one son and five daughters. Forte became a British subject after the war.<br>
<br>During the depths of post-war austerity Forte began collaborating with a jovial cockney property developer, Joe Levy. Levy had an estate agent's credo: &#145;If you can't make a damned good living within three square miles of Piccadilly Circus, don't try in this profession. And never go into a back street&#146;  (Marriott, 182). Forte learned much from Levy, including the buying and leaseback of property. At Levy's prompting he bought the Lyons tea-room at Rainbow Corner on Shaftesbury Avenue, near Piccadilly Circus, with a &pound;35,000 loan from Prudential Assurance. By leasing part of the site to himself at a rent of &pound;4000 a year, and leasing the rest at &pound;8000, he achieved an annual income of &pound;12,000. Thereafter he enlarged his fortune by property deals as well as catering, and became known to the City pages as a property financier as much as a restaurateur. In 1950 he leased the resplendent Criterion building on the south side of Piccadilly Circus at an annual rent of &pound;12,000, used its Marble Hall restaurant as a cafeteria serving chicken Maryland, ice g&acirc;teaux and the like, and leased back other parts of the building. As an expert in mass feeding and the costing of cheap food he secured half of the catering concession for the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1953&#151;again advised by Levy&#151;he bought the Caf&eacute; Monico site at Piccadilly Circus from the Express Dairy. Finally, in 1953, he and Sir Leslie Joseph obtained a twenty-one-year lease from London county council to run a funfair in Battersea Park, and to turn the Cremorne beer garden into a restaurant (he severed his connection when the funfair gained an insalubrious reputation as a haunt of hooligans). These deals made Forte a millionaire. Journalists nicknamed him Mr Piccadilly  (Hennessy, 5).<br>
<br>In April 1954 Forte was co-opted onto the board of the Caf&eacute; Royal, and soon stretched his resources by buying its Regent Street building. At critical moments of expansion he dared to take on high leverage, and there were phases of his career in which he was personally short of money. The glamorous Caf&eacute; Royal was Forte's favourite property: for years he kept a private penthouse office there. In July 1954&#151;ten months after an earlier offer of 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per share had been rejected&#151;Forte paid 10<i>s</i>. per share to buy the entire Criterion site, including the Criterion Theatre. The deal cost about &pound;800,000. At the same time, after convoluted manoeuvres, he bought the caterers Slaters and Bodega, with a valuable property portfolio. In 1955 he formed a new subsidiary, Forte's Popular Restaurants, and received the first catering concession at Heathrow airport. In 1957 he went into partnership with Bernard Delfont to convert the London Hippodrome music-hall into a theatre restaurant called Talk of the Town. His ambition to have a luxury restaurant was satisfied by buying the Hungaria restaurant in Lower Regent Street.<br>
<br>Forte befriended the Labour politician Alf Robens, who introduced him as a potential sympathizer to the party leader, Hugh Gaitskell. Gaitskell, who described him in 1956 as &#145;<i>the</i> great caterer in the country&#146;, was delighted when Forte undertook to give an annual subsidy of &pound;5000 to the Glasgow socialist weekly <span class="italic">Forward</span> (<span class="italic">Diary of Hugh Gaitskell</span>, 470). In 1959 Gaitskell offered to recommend him for a peerage. Forte, who was by then expending his extra-business energies as chairman of the charity fund-raising National Sporting Club, declined, for he was far from a socialist and fixed in his resistance to union recognition in his operations. In 1980 only about 10 per cent of his staff was unionized: he frequently voiced his dislike of being bullied by union officials or anyone else.<br>
<br>Until 1948 Forte lived in flats off Portland Place, a short walk from that stretch of London, Regent Street between Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus, which was the focus of his interests. He then moved to 7 Greenaway Gardens in Hampstead, and installed his parents and other relations nearby. In 1970 he took over Chester House in Upper Belgrave Street from Lord Bruntisfield, and subsequently moved to nearby Lowndes House. A keen shot, in 1965 he bought the 1500 acre Ryde farm estate at Ripley in Surrey. His interests were controlled by his privately owned company, Forte Holdings, with headquarters at 251&#150;9 Regent Street, overlooking Oxford Circus.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Forte was chairman of the London Publicity Committee, a forerunner of the London Tourist Board (on which he also served). He envisaged a vast expansion of tourism, and recognized that this could not be accomplished while holiday visitors to London, &#145;the greatest city in the world&#146;, remained seasonal. His strategy to attract off-season visitors was to promote London's conference business by a publicity drive. In an article for <span class="italic">The Times</span> (25 March 1958), he wrote:<blockquote>Paris, Geneva, Brussels and many continental cities, most of which are not only smaller than London but have a fraction of London's amenities, do far better at encouraging conferences. We in this city are too complacent in a world which is becoming more publicity-conscious than ever &hellip; many Continental cities are vying to become the capital of a more united Europe. Why should this not be London?</blockquote>In the 1960s Swan Tours and Milbanke Travel became wholly owned Forte subsidiaries, and he held a stake in Thomas Cook until 1970. By 1978 almost half of Forte's guests in British hotels came from abroad.<br>
<br>In 1958 Forte bought his first hotel, the Waldorf Hotel at Aldwych, for &pound;600,000, which he raised by selling his lease of the Monico site in Piccadilly to Jack Cotton for &pound;500,000. He then arranged a sale and leaseback deal with Prudential Assurance on the Waldorf. The following year he bought the Quality Inn chain of restaurants and extended his ownership of lower-grade provincial hotels: there were about 100 in 1980. By 1960 Forte was a top table guest at Cotton's famous annual luncheon at the Dorchester Hotel. He did several property deals with Sir Isaac Wolfson, from whom he bought Jay's fashion store at Oxford Circus in 1961, and by 1962 Anthony Sampson was writing, &#145;the era of Nuffield and de Havilland is being succeeded by the era of Charles Forte and Jack Cotton&#146;  (Sampson, 499). In 1969 Forte bought the Frederick Hotels group, with eight hotels including the Russell in Bloomsbury. In 1970 he bought three Paris hotels, the George V, Plaza Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e, and Tr&eacute;moille. Subsequently he acquired the Ritz Hotel in Madrid and the H&ocirc;tel des Bergues in Geneva. His company built airport hotels at Heathrow, Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow as well as the Golden Sands Hotel near Famagusta in Cyprus. He bought three hotels in Bermuda from Sir Harold Wernher and another hotel in Jamaica, and erected a village of holiday cottages in Sardinia.<br>
<br>Forte's other acquisitions included the Kardomah coffee houses and Henekey wine-bar chains, Fuller's tea-shop and chocolate business (1959), Bellevue Stadium in Manchester (1962), the Mr Whippy ice-cream business (1962), and Joseph Terry, chocolate manufacturers, for &pound;4.3 million (1963). He invested &pound;50,000 in the publishers Sidgwick and Jackson in 1956, and joined the board: later the firm published his anodyne and forgetful memoirs, <span class="italic">Forte</span> (1986).<br>
<br>Forte successfully tendered to run the Newport Pagnell service-station cafeteria on the M1 motorway from London to Leeds, which opened in 1959. Another eight Forte motorway cafeterias were opened over the next twenty years, and damaged the Forte brand by the poor quality of the food. In 1961 he opened (outside Oxford) the first of his Travelodge chain of motels, with restaurants and petrol stations attached, sited on trunk roads. It was rumoured that Enrico Mattei, Forte's friend who was the controversial chairman of the Italian state oil company ENI, would join him in the motel business. In 1961 Forte became chairman of the wholly owned English subsidiary of AGIP, the marketing arm of ENI. AGIP began opening petrol stations on prime English sites. After Mattei's aircraft crashed in dubious circumstances in 1962 Forte was stunned into speechlessness for the only time in his life. He assisted the sale of AGIP's English petrol stations to Esso for about &pound;12 million, but did not take up share options worth &pound;1.5 million.<br>
<br>Forte looked distinctively Italian, standing five feet four inches tall, dapper, with a neat moustache, bristling energy, and formal punctilio. He was a smiling, courteous martinet. At home, he liked order and refinement: he was stern and exacting with his children. In business, he was a forceful, even imperious presence who vitalized, chivvied, and rewarded his employees. Always he was self-consciously dignified. Punctuality was a passion with him. He prided himself on working openly with a team of trusted deputies, strove to be considerate, and enjoyed the admiring dependence of his senior managers. Wages in his group were higher than average in the sector, but the annual turnover of his low-paid staff of about 70 per cent was also above average. He did not take defeat well, but never repined over reverses: his driving will spurred him forward to jump at the next challenge. The future for him was not problematic but promised satisfactions.<br>
<br>Forte Holdings was one of the largest privately owned businesses in Britain. In 1961 he agreed a &pound;30 million merger with Mecca, a publicly quoted company operating bingo halls, ballrooms, ice-rinks, and diners. This news delighted the stock exchange, which was eager for investors to get a stake in Forte's flourishing, fast-expanding business. The deal however collapsed because of the difficulties met by accountants in valuing the diverse components of Forte Holdings at a price acceptable to its owner. Speculators who bought heavily in Mecca shares as a way of getting a slice of Forte's earnings lost heavily when the amalgamation was discontinued. Mecca was subsequently acquired by Sir Max Joseph's Grand Metropolitan Estates. Despite this stumble Forte was impatient to stride into the motel business, and to develop his chain of steak houses, but with each motel costing about &pound;250,000 his organization's financial needs were too big for his resources. Forte Holdings was therefore floated on the stock exchange in 1962 to raise the necessary millions. The issue proved a resounding success, being heavily over-subscribed. Control of this holding company was retained by its founder's specially created private company, Forte Investments. Effectively he had 71 per cent voting control.<br>
<br>About this time Forte bought the City catering group Ring and Brymer (which catered for the lord mayor's banquet, Chelsea flower show, and Farnborough air show), the restaurant Gennaro's of Soho, and an amusements business, Fairwater Glides. In 1969 he bought Lillywhite's clothes store on the corner of Lower Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus. He took over the promenade piers at Blackpool, New Brighton, and Llandudno, and opened the Serpentine restaurant in Hyde Park. When Forte acquired provincial hotels their interiors were gutted, their furnishings were given a monotonous modernity that soon dated, their purchasing was centralized, their meals were ruled by &#145;portion control&#146;, and their prices were standardized. The beautiful gilt mosaic ceiling of the Marble Hall at the Criterion was hidden by a shoddy, lowered ceiling and forgotten for several decades under Forte's stewardship. His view was that his Little Chef and Happy Eater diners, and Travelodges, were reliable, hygienic, and affordable. Detractors complained of their soul-immolating uniformity, indifferent cooking, and stifling mediocrity.<br>
<br>By 1970 Forte's company employed 16,000 and had assets of &pound;70 million. It vied with Trust Houses, long known for its medium-sized provincial hotels with old-fashioned charm but embarrassing plumbing. Under an ambitious chairman, Lord Crowther, Trust Houses had lately developed a bland but lucrative chain of Post House motor-hotels. In 1970 it was agreed to merge the two businesses in a new company, Trust House Forte, which with assets of &pound;120 million surpassed Maxwell Joseph's Grand Metropolitan as Britain's largest hotelier. These assets included 215 hotels in Britain, thirteen foreign hotels, 250 restaurants and caf&eacute;s, and 1500 canteens, catering for fifty airlines, ten piers, seven motorway service areas, and four amusement parks. Trust House was strong in industrial catering and English hotels (including the Grosvenor House, Hyde Park, Brown's, and Cavendish hotels) while Forte's strengths lay in public catering and foreign hotels. Forte expected his own way: if someone submitted a carefully argued policy paper that went against what he wished to do, he ignored it. This attitude riled both Crowther and the Trust House management, whose methods Forte found cumbersome and bureaucratic. There were other tensions: Trust House headquarters staff left work at 5.30 sharp, but Forte's management was instilled with his habit of long, punishing hours. Crowther had intimated that he would retire after a year as chairman to be succeeded by his deputy chairman, Forte, but reneged on this deal. The two men came to loathe one another, and traded public insults: Crowther accused Forte of costing the company a million pounds a year in trappings and expenses. Whereas Crowther relied on the support of old Trust House directors Forte nominated Sir Charles Hardie and the Conservative Party chairman, Lord Thorneycroft (who had an Italian wife), to the merged board: their backing proved decisive.<br>
<br>In October 1971 Allied Breweries launched a &pound;128 million takeover bid which intensified the animosity. Forte outmanoeuvred Crowther by jockeying onto the board his friend Alf Robens (by then a peer), and thus obtained a majority among the directors. Recognizing that his grip on the chair was precarious, Crowther supported Allied's offer. Forte, who owned the largest stake in the company, borrowed &pound;2 million to outbid Allied for shares in the market: he mustered friends such as Delfont and Max Joseph to buy with him, and paid for an adroit public relations campaign to sway shareholders. Allied's bid was defeated, Crowther and his cohorts resigned, and Forte's merger with Trust House evolved into a delayed takeover. Crowther dropped dead a few days later.<br>
<br>Forte installed Thorneycroft as chairman of Trust House Forte and served as chief executive until he replaced Thorneycroft in 1978. (The two men were co-trustees of the Italian Hospital in Bloomsbury, which they abruptly shut in 1989.) During the 1970s Forte participated in several huge overseas hotel projects, notably the al-Jazira in Bahrain, the Plaza of the Americas in Dallas, and the Riyadh Palace in Saudi Arabia. In 1973 he acquired 460 American hotels and motels by purchasing TraveLodge International of California. The Pierre Hotel in New York was bought soon afterwards. In 1976 Trust House Forte paid &pound;25 million for the Lyons group of thirty-four hotels, including the Cumberland, Strand Palace, and Regent Palace hotels in London; in 1981 it bought the entertainment interests of Sir Jules Thorn's Thorn-EMI, including three London theatres; and in 1986 paid &pound;186 million for the hotel and catering interests of the Imperial group, which Lord Hanson had recently taken over. Forte injured his reputation by a prolonged attempt&#151;beginning in 1981 with the backing of Kuwaiti investors, and fizzling out in 1989&#151;to wrest control of the Savoy Hotel from interests led by Sir Hugh Wontner. Forte's siege of the Savoy and antagonism to Wontner were comparable to Tiny Rowland's siege of Harrods and loathing of Mohamed Fayed in 1981&#150;92. Both episodes were in all senses vain. Forte spent &pound;38 million to buy 69 per cent of Savoy's equity, but held only 42 per cent of voting capital.<br>
<br>Forte was knighted in 1970, and received a life peerage in 1982 on the recommendation of Margaret Thatcher. He was one of the entrepreneurs&#151;along with Kenneth Keith, Arnold Weinstock, Marcus Sieff, John King, and James Hanson&#151;who were promoted to the House of Lords in Thatcher's first term, and signalled the capitalism she admired: despite her commitment to reviving small businesses, her favourite businessmen were despotic rulers of colossal fiefs. Forte venerated Mrs Thatcher, who spoke at his eightieth birthday dinner, attended by 1200 guests, at the Grosvenor House Hotel. This gala was described in acidulous detail in Woodrow Wyatt's diary for 22 November 1988:<blockquote>Charles Forte made a speech, far too long. He kept on saying how much he loved his wife and how marvellous she was. Then came the cutting of the cake ceremony which was preceded by a fanfare of Household Cavalry trumpeters, or Life Guard trumpeters, with their great banners, all looking very royal &hellip; and somewhat overdoing it for vulgarity. Then we had Vera Lynn who sang the most appalling song, &#145;from all the women especially, and Irene Forte, to Charles Forte&#146;. (<span class="italic">Journals of Woodrow Wyatt</span>, 1.670)</blockquote>In 1983 Forte appointed his son Rocco as chief executive, while retaining the chairmanship. The corporate name was changed in 1991 to Forte plc. Sales in that year were worth &pound;2641 million, and shareholders' funds stood at &pound;2961 million&#151;of which nearly two-thirds represented freehold land and buildings. Institutional shareholders grew restive at his baronial style of management, and complained that Forte's board was a gerontocracy. Finally, in 1992, he relinquished the chairmanship to his son, and was named life president, but his renunciation was too late. After a fierce takeover battle, control of his vulnerable empire was seized by Granada for &pound;3.9 billion in 1996. Latterly, although physically hale, Forte was afflicted by senile dementia. He died at his London house, Lowndes House, Belgravia, on 28 February 2007, and was survived by his wife and their six children. His son Rocco and eldest daughter Olga had by then built up a chain of luxury hotels throughout Europe, Rocco Forte Hotels Ltd.<br>
