<span class="headword">Cooke,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1528), <span class="occ">mercer and benefactor</span>, was born in Minsterworth, a few miles west of Gloucester, the son of Thomas and Alice Cooke. The loss of Gloucester's early civic records means that little can be said of his career there, except that he prospered greatly in the town. He served as sheriff&#151;the equivalent of bailiff&#151;in 1494 and 1498, and became an alderman in 1501, the year in which he was first chosen to be mayor; he was elected again in 1507, 1512, and 1519. In June of 1513 he was involved, as mayor, in a dispute over common rights with the abbot of Gloucester. In 1524 he was by far the richest man in Gloucester, with an assessment of &pound;300 for that year's subsidy, more than double that of any other townsman. The source of his wealth was probably the generalized trading that went with his being a mercer, though since he bought a fulling mill at Ebley he may also have had a specialized interest in clothmaking. The provision he made in his will for the repair of the roads that ran out of Gloucester north-east to Evesham and east to Birdlip, on the way to Cirencester, may point to some of his preferred markets. He and his wife, Joan, lived in the parish of St Mary de Crypt, or Christ Church, one of two parishes in the town inhabited by a substantial proportion of Gloucester's &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>John Cooke fell ill in the spring of 1528. In his will, drawn up on 18 May, he requested burial in the chancel of St Mary's, at the north end of the high altar. Numerous bequests showed him to have been both charitable and conventionally concerned for the salvation of his soul. He left &pound;5 to a priest to celebrate masses in the church of St Nicholas, and no less than &pound;60 for distribution to the poor on the day of his burial, at his month's mind, and on the first anniversary of his death. Sixteen sets of vestments, at a cost of 26<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. each, were left to various churches, mostly in Gloucester but also to Minsterworth church. Numerous individual bequests showed him mindful of his godchildren and kinsfolk, suggesting that he had two or three sisters. And he also made provision both for his wife and for a school he planned to found in Gloucester. In this he was repeating the terms of a deed he had drawn up a few days earlier, on 12 May, whereby estates in Gloucester itself, in Badgeworth to the east of it, and in the neighbourhoods of Stroud and of Westbury-on-Severn, were conveyed to a group of ten leading townsmen, many of them past or future office-holders, who were themselves to convey them to his widow for her lifetime, with reversion on her death to a free grammar school that was to be founded in Gloucester.<br>
<br>John Cooke made it clear in his will that he had taken his wife into his confidence over his plans for a school, directing the trustees to act &#145;to such uses purpose and ententes as she shall declare thereof by hir lerned counsel to the performaunce of my wille as she do know my full mynde in these purpose&#146;, and ordering them to augment its endowment by buying lands worth &pound;20 per annum, &#145;as I have at several tymes before my death declared published and shewed to my said wife&#146;  (Austin, <span class="italic">Crypt School</span>, 140&#150;44). He died on 14 September 1528, and was buried as he had requested.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_94982"></a><span class="headword">Joan Cooke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1544/5) did all that her husband had required. Her own origins are unrecorded. Her husband's bequest of &pound;10 to his brother-in-law Thomas Messenger, and her own generous bequest to Robert Messenger, suggest that she was born into that family, but certainty is impossible. John expressed the hope that she would not remarry, and she did not do so. Instead she devoted her energies to fulfilling her responsibilities as executor of his will, and in particular to bringing to fruition his plans for a school. This process began soon after John's death, on 6 October 1529, when a portion of the churchyard of St Mary de Crypt was acquired as the site for the proposed school. However, several years passed before further action was taken, until on 12 May 1538 Joan Cooke purchased a mortmain licence from the crown enabling the mayor and burgesses of Gloucester to acquire land worth up to &pound;50 to support the new school. A few months later the dissolution of Llanthony Priory (which had hitherto claimed a monopoly on schooling in Gloucester) provided Joan Cooke and John's trustees with an opportunity to augment the endowment for the school provided by John's will. They made the most of it. On 5 September 1539, supported by a letter from Hugh Latimer, bishop of Worcester, to Thomas Cromwell, they completed the purchase from the crown of &#145;the manor or grange of Poddesmede&#146; (Podsmead in Hemsted, just west of the city) and other associated lands previously held by the priory for the use of the school, at a cost of &pound;266 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards, on 11 January 1540, Joan Cooke, the city of Worcester, and the mayor and burgesses of Gloucester executed a curious tripartite deed giving control of the school to the town of Gloucester, which for its part undertook to implement the provisions of John Cooke's will with regard to the school. This document makes it clear that the school had now been built, and provides a detailed plan for its functioning, including extensive stipulations concerning its funding. It also specifies the stipend the schoolmaster is to receive (&pound;10 per annum for a priest, who will also offer masses for the souls of the donors and their family, &pound;9 for a layman, who will not provide such services) and provides for his residence in rooms above the school; no space was to be provided for a wife or children. The mayor and burgesses of Worcester were to ensure that their opposite numbers of Gloucester fulfilled their obligations to the school under this deed; in this they were encouraged by the annuity of &pound;6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. subsequently granted to them for this supervision by Joan Cooke.<br>
<br>The school founded under John Cooke's will seems to have begun to function shortly afterwards, in a building which survives on the north side of the church. Dame Joan lived for another four years, during which she was troubled by pressure from the Gloucester authorities to hand over the title deeds for the school's endowment. Her health was beginning to fail, and she was said to have become &#145;soche an unwieldy womon for age and unweldynes that she could not ride&#146;, but she resolutely refused to surrender the documents, saying &#145;that for her tyme she was mystres of the rentes therof, and therefore wold have the kepinge of the evidences and at her death she said she wold delyver them&#146;, as indeed she did  (Austin, &#145;John and Joan Cooke's gift&#146;, 204&#150;5). She drew up her will on 1 May 1544, and it was proved on 25 February following. She requested burial &#145;in the same place where my husbande John Cooke was buried&#146;  (Austin, <span class="italic">Crypt School</span>, 162) and made very elaborate provision for the celebration of his obit, as well as leaving &pound;40 for distribution to the poor and making numerous bequests to relatives and godchildren. Perhaps surprisingly, her will makes no reference to the school.<br>
<br>John and Joan Cooke are commemorated by brasses in the north transept of St Mary de Crypt Church, and also by a joint portrait of uncertain authenticity painted after the couple's death and tentatively dated to the years immediately after 1598. But their most substantial monument is the Crypt School, which despite several changes of site continues to fulfil the intentions of its founders as a boys' grammar school, bearing out Joan Cooke's assertion, during her dispute with the Gloucester authorities, &#145;that her husband and she had lovyd the said towne&#146;  (Austin, &#145;John and Joan Cooke's gift&#146;, 219).<br>
