<span class="headword">Robinson,  John Armstrong</span>  (1925&#150;1998), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 18 December 1925 at 47 Lavender Gardens, Wandsworth, London, the son of Samuel Robinson, assistant principal in the Colonial Office, and his wife, Eleanor Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Motley. His education, at Westminster School (where he was a king's scholar) and Christ Church, Oxford, was punctuated by two years in the RAF (1944&#150;6). He graduated with a second-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1949, and joined the foreign service in August the same year. His first overseas posting was to New Delhi, in 1950. There he met Marianne Berger, a diplomatist in the Swiss service. They married in 1952, and had a son and a daughter. Robinson returned to the Foreign Office in the year of his marriage. He went subsequently to Helsinki (1953&#150;6) and to the commercial department of the British embassy in Paris (1956&#150;8). But it was when he returned to London to work on European economic affairs that he found his m&eacute;tier.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Whitehall was united in thinking European integration a pipe dream. The Foreign Office did not think that the German lion would ever lie down with the French lamb. The barons of the Board of Trade and the Treasury considered that freeing trade completely within Europe would never be acceptable, in particular to a France that had been protectionist since Colbert. The way forward, everyone in London agreed, was to reduce trade barriers modestly and multilaterally, thus enabling Britain to remain apart from Europe and to retain its preferential trading links with the Commonwealth and its special relationship with the United States. But a few of the post-war entrants to Whitehall began to challenge these assumptions. Robinson was foremost among them. When overseas economic questions came up for discussion in Whitehall, the Foreign Office line had been one of magisterial indifference. Suddenly this began to change. A young, forceful diplomat was challenging other departments on their own ground.<br>
<br>Robinson was a natural candidate for the delegation which, after Harold Macmillan's application in 1961, sought to negotiate Britain's entry into the European Community (EC). He moved to Brussels and played throughout the negotiations a role far more important than was warranted by his rank or years. Edward Heath, who as lord privy seal headed the negotiating team, thought particularly highly of him. After General de Gaulle vetoed the British application in 1963, Robinson stayed at the now strengthened, permanent United Kingdom delegation to the EC in Brussels, developing still further his knowledge of the community scene. &#145;To get into the Community&#146;, Sir Con O'Neill later wrote,<blockquote>this country had to follow an extremely strait and narrow path, maintaining the true objective, overcoming disappointments, above all resisting the temptations of plausible but inadequate alternatives. The man who did most for many years by rigorous argument and strong determination to hold us to this strait and narrow path is Mr John Robinson. (O'Neill)</blockquote>When negotiations for British entry into the EC started again in 1970, Robinson (who in 1968&#150;70 headed the European economic integration department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with the rank of counsellor) was an indispensable choice for a key role. He fulfilled this as in effect the deputy and troubleshooter of Sir Con O'Neill, appointed in 1970 the head of the delegation at official level. It was a negotiation of formidable complexity, not least because the EC had broadened and deepened its scope since the failure of Britain's previous attempt at entry. At home opposition was rife, and the difficulty of finding solutions acceptable to British domestic and overseas interests was never-ending. Robinson was a man of extraordinary vision. He saw from the outset how and at what pace the negotiations would evolve. Like a Roman prophecy, events unfolded as he had predicted. At the end of the negotiations O'Neill said that Robinson's contribution had been indispensable. &#145;He knew everyone, understood everything, foresaw everything, did everything&#146;  (O'Neill). &#145;I sought his advice many hundreds of times, and can scarcely remember an occasion when I failed to follow it&#146;  (O'Neill).<br>
<br>Robinson's later years as a diplomat were less happy. After spells as assistant under-secretary of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1971&#150;3) and as ambassador to Algeria (1974&#150;7), he moved to Washington in 1977 as minister and deputy to the ambassador, Peter Jay. Both were men of exceptional quality but a difference of temperament did not make for an easy working relationship. After a spell at the United Nations dealing with Palestinian problems Robinson was appointed ambassador to Israel in 1980. This was not an inspired appointment: the Israelis regarded him with suspicion after his successful dealings with Palestine in New York, and in 1981 he decided to take up an offer of early retirement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He became a market gardener outside Cordes in France, where he found contentment. Deteriorating health, though, finally forced his retirement to Switzerland. He died there on 16 January 1998. He was survived by his wife, Marianne, and their two children.<br>
<br>Robinson's more conventional colleagues saw him as having stumbled on the road to a knighthood and a major embassy. But he had no time for pomp and circumstance. He was by nature a doer, more akin to Milner's &#145;kindergarten&#146; in South Africa in the early 1900s than to the urbane diplomatic round. He had a lively sense of humour and could be the most charming of companions, but he had a steely edge and neither rank nor protocol would dissuade him from pressing his case when he thought it in the public interest. Hugo Young described him as the &#145;militant vanguard&#146; of the European cause in the Foreign Office. With his vision, knowledge, and relentless hard work, he made a bigger contribution to the integration of Britain in Europe than any other diplomat of his generation.<br>
