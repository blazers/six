<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hook,  James</span>  (1746&#150;1827), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in 1746, probably on 3 June, in the parish of St John, Maddermarket, Norwich, the son of a cutler. He was taught by Thomas Garland, organist of Norwich Cathedral, and possibly also by Charles Burney when Burney was resident at King's Lynn. He began playing in public concerts while still a boy&#151;he was performing concertos at the age of six&#151;and later taught music at a local boarding-school. About 1763 he moved to London and became organist at White Conduit House, a tea house in Clerkenwell, where he played daily. He soon established himself as a composer too, and won a Catch Club medal in 1765. On 29 May 1766 at St Pancras, Middlesex, he married Elizabeth Jane Madden (<i>d</i>. 1795), a miniature painter, and five months later they visited Norwich, where Hook played in a benefit concert for his widowed mother. Hook and his wife had two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13684/', "James Hook (1772?&#150;1828)")</script>, later dean of Worcester and father of the clergyman Walter Farquhar Hook, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13686/', "Theodore Edward Hook (1788&#150;1841)")</script>, a writer. In 1769 Hook became organist and composer at Marylebone Gardens and about this time also he was appointed organist at St John's, Horsleydown, Bermondsey. Five years later he moved to the more prestigious Vauxhall Gardens, where he became well known particularly for his keyboard concerto performances given each evening during the summer season.<br>
<br>Hook's output was extensive. Of about thirty stage works, written for the main London theatres as well as for the gardens, the operas <span class="italic">Il dilettante</span> (Marylebone, 1772), <span class="italic">The Lady of the Manor</span> (Covent Garden, 1778), and <span class="italic">The Double Disguise</span> (Drury Lane, 1784, to a libretto by his wife) are among the better examples, but Hook's dramatic sense was not well developed. His music for Vauxhall also included keyboard concertos, cantatas, and more than 2000 songs, some of them written in the fashionable Scottish folk style. His popularity there&#151;he stayed for almost half a century&#151;was dependent not least on his ability to turn out musical ephemera in the simple, light, easy-going idiom that suited the relatively unsophisticated tastes of the clientele. He kept abreast of continental compositional trends, from the new orchestral techniques of the Mannheim composers in the 1760s to the symphonic writing of Haydn thirty years later, and was quick to incorporate them in his own music, to the extent that he was considered by some to be little more than an expert plagiarist. Yet he was among the more accomplished English practitioners of the <i>galant</i> style, which, with its lucid phraseology and uncomplicated harmonic gestures, appealed to Vauxhall audiences, and, significantly, he was one of the first English composers of the period for whom the music of Handel ceased to be the main stylistic impetus. In 1768, at a concert in Hickford's room in Brewer Street, he performed a concerto on the newfangled pianoforte, perhaps the first person to do so in public in England, and some of his later keyboard works show a development towards a specifically pianistic technique. Hook was a prosperous teacher, and his <span class="italic">Guida di musica</span> instruction manuals, as well as the large amount of chamber and keyboard music he published, must have had a considerable impact on domestic music-making in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain.<br>
<br>With Vauxhall Gardens falling out of fashion, Hook left suddenly in 1820, and he died in Boulogne in 1827. His second wife, Harriet, whose surname may have been Horncastle (<i>d</i>. 1873), outlived him by many years, and they may have had a son. The oboist William Parke recalled Hook in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>: a good-humoured character, he walked with a limp, having been born club-footed, and was &#145;a very agreeable companion&#146;, an inveterate leg-puller who had &#145;a happy knack of punning&#146;  (Parke, 2.255).<br>
