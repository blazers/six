<span class="headword">Thornton,  James</span>  (1787&#150;1854), <span class="occ">cook</span>, was born on 15 March 1787, the sixth of the seven children of William Thornton (1747&#150;1814) and Ann Morris, at 17 Bryanston Street, Portman Square, London. After attending a local school he was apprenticed to a Mr Farrance, a prosperous cook at Charing Cross, at the age of thirteen, and then to John Escudier, a hotel-keeper in Oxford Street. James's employers were probably French &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the revolution. The pay was good and so were the prospects (male cooks were then employed by some four hundred wealthy families, the duke of York paying the highest salary, &pound;500). On 6 January 1809 Thornton married Sarah Oakley at St James's, Westminster. They had two children, James and Sarah, both cooks, as were four of the fourteen grandchildren.<br>
<br>Adventurous and restless, Thornton was engaged by Major Colin Campbell (1776&#150;1847) on 20 August 1811 to be the duke of Wellington's cook in the Peninsula, where the war was in its second year. Thornton's service to the commander-in-chief was his road to success, though his skills were not fully exploited by Wellington, a notoriously moderate eater. On 5 September Thornton sailed for Lisbon, joining Wellington in his winter quarters on the borders of Portugal and Spain. Few cooked luncheons were required, since Wellington preferred to carry a hard-boiled egg in his pocket. He breakfasted alone, but dinner was convivial, despite the monotonous &#145;cold meat&#146; after a specially long march  (Thornton, 27). Normally Thornton, assisted by the son of Lord Enniskillen's cook and a scullery-man, would serve two courses to Wellington and his staff, heaping their plates with food all mixed together, roasts with dessert. He would not have been encouraged to serve up to eight elegant, separate courses, as was the practice of leading French cooks. Thornton himself procured vegetables and fruit, paying the peasants for everything, whereas Napoleon's armies requisitioned their supplies, often provoking fierce retaliation. Thornton's later account provides many insights into Wellington's campaigning: descriptions of balls, earth ovens, and of Wellington's famous boots being kissed by admiring crowds. By 1814 victory was won and Thornton was sent home. He took a winter job with Sir Patrick Murray in Scotland and in 1815, after Napoleon's escape from Elba, Campbell again engaged him to cook for Wellington, in Brussels.<br>
<br>At 4 a.m. on 18 June 1815 Thornton was woken by the butler, did his marketing, rode to Waterloo and cooked Wellington's &#145;hot dinner&#146; after the battle. Soon after the duke's death in 1852, a French cook claimed the honour, but Thornton refuted him in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>:<blockquote>Having seen in your widely circulated paper that the late and ever-to-be-honoured Duke of Wellington had a French cook at Waterloo who is reported to have said, &#145;He knew that the Duke would return to his dinner&#146;. I beg most respectfully to inform you that I cooked his dinner on the day &hellip; his Grace rode up after the battle, and on getting off his horse Copenhagen he saw me and said, &#145;Is that you? Get dinner.&#146; (Thornton, 49)</blockquote>In 1818 the duke returned to England after being ambassador in Paris, where he &#145;kept French Cooks&#146;  (Thornton, 95). Thornton had rejoined his service, becoming steward at Apsley House in 1820, a prestigious post. However, he resigned on 29 December after a disagreement with the duchess, herself an embarrassingly inefficient housekeeper, over his alleged extravagance: 298 pounds of meat, excluding lamb, calves' feet, and sweetbreads, had been ordered for thirteen people for three days. He subsequently served as cook in a number of great households.<br>
<br>Documentary evidence of Thornton's later career is scarce, but he wrote from Lowther Castle, Westmorland, to his daughter on 21 October 1841, enclosing a recipe for white fish. He had been too busy to write sooner, having twenty for dinner most days and &#145;an Enormous Quantity of Servants to feed every Day&#146;. Recipes followed for curry and strawberries, with news of a wedding breakfast and a supper in Regent's Park on the same day. Thornton spent about five years as cook to Lord Frederick Fitzclarence, lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth in succession to Wellington's brother-in-law Sir Hercules Pakenham, and in 1852, during that time, he answered questions about his wartime experiences. When Thornton moved on, Fitzclarence recommended him highly in a character reference: &#145;I can not give him <i>too</i> good a character&#146;  (Thornton, 51).<br>
<br>Thornton's recollections of his time in Wellington's service were published in 1985, but much of his life remains obscure. His wife is presumed to have predeceased him. Thornton died on 12 August 1854, at 8 Caroline Street, Belgravia, London, thirty hours after contracting cholera.<br>
