<span class="headword">Johnston,  George</span>  (1764&#150;1823), <span class="occ">army officer and agriculturist in Australia</span>, was born on 19 March 1764 at Annandale, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, the son of Captain George Johnston, aide-de-camp to Lord Percy, later duke of Northumberland. There is no substance to the accusation made by Governor William Bligh that he was &#145;Percy's bastard&#146;, but the patronage of the Percys supported Johnston throughout his career and probably saved his life in 1811. On 6 March 1776, with his patron's help, Johnston secured a second lieutenancy in the 45th company of marines. He served in New York and Halifax, purchased a first lieutenancy, and then saw service in the East Indies against the French; he was severely wounded in an action in which his ship, HMS <i>Sultan</i>, was involved.<br>
<br>Following a period on half pay and in the absence of any war, Johnston decided that the distant penal colony of New South Wales offered full pay and some hope of promotion. He also had an interest in botany and zoology which could be furthered by a sojourn in the Antipodes, although later claims that he knew he would make his fortune are false. To Johnston this was indeed <i>terra incognita</i>. He sailed for the new colony aboard the first fleet in 1787. His ship, the 338 ton <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, carried female convicts, including the fifteen-year-old Jewish milliner Esther Abrahams, transported with her infant daughter, Rosanna, for stealing 24 yards of silk lace; from the time of the voyage she became Johnston's common-law wife. The couple were eventually married on 12 November 1814, probably as part of Governor Lachlan Macquarie's plan of moral example by officers. They had three sons and four daughters, and were a powerful couple&#151;sociable, intelligent, popular, and economically successful.<br>
<br>Johnston adapted well to Australian life. He avoided the endemic quarrels between the officers of the detachment, dodged his irascible superior, Major Robert Ross, and stayed on good terms with Governor Arthur Phillip, acting as adjutant of orders. Similarly, he was aide-de-camp to the second governor, John Hunter, a client of Lord Howe, and judiciously steered clear of the bitter personal quarrels which wracked this administration. When the marines returned home in 1790, Johnston chose to stay in the colony, commanding a company of his marines who had volunteered for service in the New South Wales Corps. His troops also included a number of emancipated convicts, later another source of conflict with Bligh.<br>
<br>Johnston's career suffered a set-back in 1800, when he was sent to England for illegal trading in spirits. However, he was never court-martialled, being protected by the Northumberland interest and the difficulty of obtaining witnesses in London, and he returned to Sydney in 1801. While away he had cemented his patronage links by gifts of Australian animals, flowers, plants, and birds; he also renewed his relationship with his former commander, Colonel Francis Grose, and through him met Grose's powerful patron, Henry Phipps, earl of Mulgrave, a link which he found critical in later years.<br>
<br>Despite friction with Governor P. G. King over the control of the corps and the status of the governor's ex-convict bodyguard, Johnston and the governor were on good terms. The relationship was strengthened in 1804 when Johnston crushed an armed insurrection organized by the United Irishmen. After leading his troops from Sydney&#151;they ran all night&#151;Johnston found the rebels near Vinegar Hill (later Rouse Hill) on the road to Windsor. He organized a meeting with the leaders of the insurgents, buying time until his troops were in position, then seized the rebels and ordered his men to cut their followers to ribbons. After hanging the leaders, summary justice heartily approved of by King, he had only one complaint&#151;&#145;the blood lust&#146; of his men, with whom he was immensely popular. Throughout the incident his own convicts, many of whom were Irish, remained loyal to their master and would have defended his farm against the rebels.<br>
<br>Johnston's actions in 1804 brought him closer to King and to Government House. However, the new governor, Bligh, caused him considerable irritation between 1806 and January 1808, largely because of the latter's attempts to interfere with the administration of the corps. Constant references by Bligh to Johnston's men as &#145;sons of bitches&#146; and vice-regal threats to remove the corps and separate the men from their &#145;whores and bastards&#146; further inflamed the situation, although Johnston counselled caution and calm. The storm broke late in January 1808, when, in the midst of an acrimonious court case against John Macarthur, Bligh threatened the six corps officers sitting as the court with charges of sedition. Johnston now acted, though the previous day he had told Bligh that an accident had made it impossible for him to move. With the support of the key economic and political groups in the colony, united in temporary coalition, on 26 January he drove in from his home at Annandale, 4 miles out, marched his men to Government House, seized control of the colony as acting governor, and placed Bligh under arrest.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Johnston's actions were manipulated by John Macarthur; he acted to defend the corps, the crown, and his officers. He also genuinely believed he was supported by the popular will, although his coalition shattered almost as soon as Bligh was removed from his residence, and Johnston found himself at the centre of the internecine quarrels which marked one of the most litigious places on earth. He was glad to hand over the governorship to his friend and superior, Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux, who arrived from Van Diemen's Land on 28 July 1808.<br>
<br>In June 1811 Johnston was court-martialled in London for his part in the overthrow of Bligh. His life was possibly in danger, but he had powerful interests&#151;Northumberland, Mulgrave, and Foveaux's patron, General Richard Fitzpatrick&#151;active on his behalf, as well as Fletcher Christian's family who had never forgiven Bligh for the <i>Bounty</i> affair. Although Sir Joseph Banks tried hard for Bligh, the weight of evidence swung behind Johnston and, as a result, he was sentenced only to be cashiered. He found support in the Colonial Office, and was free to return to New South Wales, where the new governor, Macquarie, was friendly. The action against Bligh cost Johnston his commission and upwards (he claimed) of &pound;6000. It convinced him that promises of support were rarely translated into action; in future he resolved to avoid politics, and, although close to Macquarie&#151;he gave the governor a stallion, Sultan, a gift from the Percys&#151;he played no further part in administration.<br>
<br>Johnston had begun farming in New South Wales in 1793, when he received a 100 acre grant from Grose, which he named Annandale. By the end of his life his holding amounted to more than 4000 acres, with land at Annandale, Bankstown, Cabramatta, and Lake Illawarra. A good farmer, Johnston favoured Irish convicts&#151;whom he believed were close to the land&#151;to work his properties; he was also a large grazier, preferring meat sheep to the fine wool breeds favoured by others, and benefiting from Northumberland's gifts of Teeswater ewes and a ram. His patron's gifts of horses added immeasurably to Johnston's colonial status.<br>
<br>A good family man, Johnston treated his wife's illegitimate daughter as his own and had strong links with all of his children. His love affair with his wife was enduring and his grief when his popular, highly intelligent son George junior, a favourite of Macquarie, who had tamed the &#145;wild cattle&#146; in the colony, was killed in a riding accident in 1820 shows a man of deep affection.<br>
<br>Johnston's death on 5 January 1823 was regretted by all sections of the deeply divided colonial society. Throughout his life the handsome officer had many friends and few enemies. He was popular with his colleagues, soldiers, and convicts. As a master he was generous and humane; he disliked the lash and used it rarely. Indeed, the most violent episode of his life in New South Wales was his hanging of the Irish insurrectionists in 1804. Johnston drank heavily but, by the standards of his own time, was not a drunkard; he read widely, liked dancing, music, and singing, and, judging by his children, he and his wife encouraged education. He was survived by his wife, who died on 26 August 1846 and was buried beside him at Annandale in the family vault designed by Francis Greenway.<br>
<br>Johnston had served the British crown with great distinction. Somewhat ingenuous and too trusting, nevertheless he made a lasting contribution to the land he came to love. He was, as his friend Macquarie said, &#145;a good, honourable man&#146;. In early New South Wales few could claim as much.<br>
