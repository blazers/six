<span class="headword">Bel,  Jean  le</span>  (<em>c.</em>1290&#150;1370), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and chronicler</span>, was of noble rank, according to the chronicler Jean d'Outremeuse. He was born about 1290 into a patrician Li&eacute;geois family with important dynastic links to the more rurally based nobility. His father was the armigerous Gilles le Bel, a money changer who became <i>&eacute;chevin</i> of Li&egrave;ge like his father and grandfather before him. The name of his mother is unknown, but she was descended from the noble Renier de Thys. His great-uncle, Jean de Cange, a canon of St Lambert and provost of St Jean at Li&egrave;ge, and a shrewd political operator, may have been a formative early influence. He had two younger brothers (Henri, who travelled with him to England and was knighted at Harwich in 1327, and Gilles, also a Li&eacute;geois cleric), and a sister who married a local knight. In old age he fathered&#151;and handsomely endowed&#151;twin sons, Jean and Gilles, the fruit of his liaison with a woman of noble descent, Marie le Hardy, from the des Pres family.<br>
<br>Le Bel's lifestyle was very much that of the worldly cleric, and the chronicler Jacques de Hemricourt provides a vivid description of his sumptuous, richly jewelled clothing, his hounds, hawks, and horses, comparing his appearance with that of a knight-banneret. His hospitality was legendary, and a retinue rivalling that of the bishop of Li&egrave;ge accompanied him to church on feast days. He saw active service in his youth in both war and tournament, and Hemricourt's description of his joyful, pleasure-seeking character, composing secular verse, is in many ways reminiscent of Chaucer's squire. His good sense and ability to manage men were turned to good account, not only in obtaining substantial pensions and grants of land with his versifying, but in the management of his household and the bringing-up of squires there.<br>
<br>By 1313 le Bel had become a canon of St Lambert, and from 1331 to 1361 he was also provost of St Jean. He became actively involved in local and regional politics, and was evidently an able negotiator: documentary references reflect his close links with the Hainault comital family, as well as the duchy of Brabant, and Jean de Luxembourg, king of Bohemia (<i>r</i>. 1310&#150;46). In 1327 he formed part of the retinue of John of Hainault, the count of Hainault's brother, who was aiding Edward III against the Scots. It is impossible to assess whether and how often he accompanied John of Hainault in the latter's wide-ranging activities in the Low Countries, but the recording of capitular business transacted in the chronicler's house at Li&egrave;ge from time to time after the mid-century may reflect an increased degree of residence there.<br>
<br>Le Bel's narrative, usually known as his <span class="italic">Chronique</span>, was intended as an accurate relation of the wars and events of 1326&#150;61, focusing predominantly on the great achievements of the kings of England and France. Although his method requires further analysis, the first section, covering 1326&#150;40, is generally believed to have been written between 1352 and 1356; the second (1340&#150;58) in 1358; and the final chapters (1359&#150;61) piecemeal, as he noted events. According to d'Outremeuse, John of Hainault was responsible for initiating the <span class="italic">Chronique</span>, specifically requiring an accurate and objective account and (with other witnesses) correcting it.<br>
<br>Le Bel's narrative of the campaign of 1327 against the Scots is essentially an eyewitness account, and includes invaluable details&#151;notably of the miseries inflicted by terrain and climate, Scottish military practices, and tensions among the lower ranks. Le Bel is also an important source for dealings between the Low Countries and England in 1338&#150;40, besides detailing the diplomatic activities that resulted in Edward III's accession in 1327 and his marriage to Philippa of Hainault in the following year.<br>
<br>Le Bel himself repeatedly emphasizes both the superior accuracy of his prose account and his endeavours to obtain information, a claim supported by d'Outremeuse. Nevertheless, he should be used with caution, for despite his evident regard for accuracy and his plain style there are occasions where his reliance on oral testimony is misleading, resulting not simply in factual error but reflecting any bias in his source or uncorroborated stories then current and generally accepted as true. The exaggerated notion of Robert d'Artois's influence in England in 1334 is such an area (a misconception shared by another Low Countries chronicler, &#145;Le Bourgeois de Valenciennes&#146;), and his account of Edward III's supposed rape of the countess of Salisbury may similarly reflect a tale current and accepted in le Bel's milieu. His narrative perspective was inevitably influenced by the defection of Jean of Hainault, Edward III's uncle by marriage and long-standing ally, to Philippe VI of France, as well as by the links of Li&egrave;ge with Philippe's ally, the king of Bohemia. It is no coincidence that his account of the battle of Cr&eacute;cy (1346) focuses on the heroism of the blind Jean de Luxembourg. Much of Froissart's <span class="italic">Chronique</span> is heavily dependent on le Bel's; however, some later versions depart considerably from le Bel's narrative. Although ultimately overshadowed by his successor, le Bel nevertheless remains a vital source for the early decades of the reign of Edward III.<br>
<br>According to Jacques de Hemricourt, who knew him well, Jean le Bel enjoyed robust good health until the end of his long life, and this is borne out by the wording of his will. He died at Li&egrave;ge on 15 February 1370, and was buried in the cathedral church of St Lambert, where he was commemorated by a chantry and an epitaph until these were destroyed in 1793.<br>
