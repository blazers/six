<span class="headword">Willoughby,  Digby</span>  (1845&#150;1901), <span class="occ">soldier and adventurer</span>, left England for South Africa in 1871 to seek his fortune. In the Zulu campaign of 1879 Willoughby was with the Natal native contingent, and was in command of the native mounted corps. He then for a time acted as auctioneer's assistant, subsequently becoming partner in the firm of Willoughby and Scoones at Pietermaritzburg. After a brief period with a theatrical company, he raised and commanded a troop of irregulars, Willoughby's Horse, which saw service in the Basuto War in 1880. In January 1884 he went to Madagascar, where, gaining the confidence of Queen Ranavalomanjaka III and her husband, the prime minister, he was appointed general commander of the Hovas or Madagascar forces (18 May). On the outbreak of the war between France and Madagascar next year he mustered a well-drilled army of 20,000 soldiers. The Hovas, however, suffered from a lack of serviceable ammunition, and were severely defeated. At the close of the war in December 1885 he helped in negotiations which established a French protectorate, and went to London charged as minister-plenipotentiary with a special mission on behalf of the Malagasy government. Although he was cordially received in England, the authorities refused to recognize him as an envoy, as he was a British subject.<br>
<br>Wearing the spurious uniform of a British field marshal, Willoughby conducted a military spectacle at the Chicago Exhibition of 1893. In October of the same year, after the start of the Matabele (Ndebele) campaign, he went to Rhodesia. The war was almost over, but he went up country by way of Kimberley, Vryburg, and Palapye. On the journey he conferred with Rhodes, and reached Bulawayo just before the end of the campaign. On the declaration of peace he helped in the administration of Rhodesia. Next year (1894) he was in London, lecturing on the Matabele campaign, but on the outbreak of the Matabele uprising, in March 1896, he was one of a council of defence at Bulawayo, under the acting administrator of Rhodesia. He revisited South Africa on the outbreak of the war there in 1899, but took no part in the fighting, and soon returned to England. Willoughby, who had made a wealthy second marriage, was then in ill health, and had lost an eye. He died at Goring-on-Thames on 3 June 1901. Willoughby was a popular and lively raconteur. His courage and soldiership were unquestioned, but showmanship and love of adventure were his most salient characteristics.<br>
