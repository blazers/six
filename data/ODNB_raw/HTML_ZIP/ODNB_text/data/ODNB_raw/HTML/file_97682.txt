<span class="headword">Bingley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Vick]</span>,  Juliet Martin</span>, Lady Bingley  (1925&#150;2005), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 18 July 1925 at St Clere's Hall, Danbury, Essex, the third of four daughters of Reginald Martin Vick (1884&#150;1971), consulting surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and his wife, Mary Kate (<i>b</i>. 1891), elder daughter of Sir Reginald James Neville Neville, first baronet, barrister and judge, of Sloley, Norfolk. She grew up with her three sisters in London in one of only two family houses in Harley Street. She attended King Alfred's School, Hampstead, which was co-educational and run without punishments or homework. Among her activities she attended spirited and energetic country dancing sessions at Cecil Sharp House. At the London School of Economics, then evacuated to Cambridge, she studied social administration. A life-changing experience was her placement with the Personal Services Society in Liverpool. For the first time she met racism, religious persecution, and poverty. She qualified as an almoner (medical social worker) in 1945 and started work at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.<br>
<br>On 7 August 1948 Juliet Vick married Alexander Noel Campbell (Alec) Bingley (1905&#150;1972), a captain in the Royal Navy, and son of Robert Noel Glanville Bingley, tea planter. After their marriage they bought Hoddesdonbury, in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, a farm mentioned in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. There she created a family home to which she was devoted for the rest of her life. She and her husband had three children: twins&#151;William and Charlotte Elizabeth 
    (Liza; <i>b</i>. 1950)
  &#151;and Penelope 
    (Polly; <i>b</i>. 1954)
  . In 1959 her husband, by now an admiral, was knighted KCB and appointed commander-in-chief, Mediterranean. The family went to live at Admiralty House in Valletta, Malta, where Juliet Bingley found full expression for her many talents. She became closely involved in reform of aspects of the Maltese health and social care system. The first president of Malta later said that her memorial was the change in attitude there to the importance of proper social welfare systems, especially for the old. She had met and become friends with Dom Mintoff, the prime minister, before she went to Malta. He was at odds with the British government, and she became an unofficial envoy, or &#145;messenger&#146; as she put it, between him and the government. She continued to fulfil this role in the 1970s and 1980s, long after leaving the country, and for this and her work in promoting social welfare in Malta the Maltese government granted her its highest award, the companionship of Honour, in 1976.<br>
<br>In 1961 Sir Alec Bingley was appointed commander-in-chief, Portsmouth, and Juliet Bingley became involved in improvements of the naval family welfare services. Two years later he retired from active service and returned to Hoddesdonbury. Juliet Bingley then began a long involvement with the National Association of Mental Health (later MIND), which culminated in four tumultuous years from 1979 as its national chairman. During this period the association changed from being an organization dominated by professional interests to one focused on the rights of those with mental health problems. MIND made a major contribution to the drafting of the <span class="roman">Mental Health Act</span> of 1983. Another important development was an increased emphasis on the contribution of volunteers.<br>
<br>In 1972 Alec Bingley died suddenly, at the age of sixty-seven, a devastating blow to his wife. Four days after his death Juliet Bingley decided that she should return to work as a medical social worker after an interval of twenty-four years. She obtained a part-time post at a small hospital in London, St Mark's, which specialized in disorders of the intestinal tract, and which was associated with St Bartholomew's. Many patients suffered from chronic or recurrent inflammatory bowel disease, and others suffered disorders of bowel function with an important emotional component. Juliet Bingley's warm and empathetic personality captivated patients and staff alike. She built up a close working relationship with both medical and nursing staff, and also with a psychotherapist. Her concern extended to the welfare of every member of the hospital staff, and she chaired a heads of staff committee. For this work she was awarded the Ellison Nash prize by St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1988, and was appointed MBE in 1990.<br>
<br>In 1979 Juliet Bingley was a founding member of the National Association for Colitis and Crohn's Disease (NACC) and served on its governing council for twenty-three years, including a period as vice-chairman. During this time membership increased to 30,000. One of her particular contributions was the development of NACC In-Contact, a telephone enquiry and support service run by trained sufferers for sufferers. She also instigated and helped to run a welfare fund for those in financial need, and established a system of competitive awards for research into the psychological and social consequences of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
<br>Juliet Bingley was well built, with a fresh, open face and blue eyes. She was outgoing and fun to be with. She had a kind of inner radiance that brought out the best in those she came into contact with, and gave them the self-confidence to do themselves justice. People felt that she cared and that they could trust her implicitly. However, she had a steely resolve as well as charm and good humour in pursuing her goals. In later years she discovered a love of writing poetry and enjoying it with the Ware Poets Group. She published a volume of her poems, <span class="italic">What It Was and What It Was Not</span> (2002), and circulated privately some charming books of illustrated stories written for her grandchildren. She collected Staffordshire figures and took great delight in the practical details of running Hoddesdonbury, and creating there a place of welcome for her family and wide circle of friends.<br>
<br>After retirement from St Mark's in 1990 Juliet Bingley worked for twelve years as counsellor for a large general practice in Welwyn, and later for Danesbury, a unit providing care, rehabilitation, and respite for adults, especially young adults with serious physical illness. She supported innumerable local activities and good causes. The local newspaper in its obituary called her &#145;the People's Champion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hertfordshire Mercury</span>, 21 Jan 2005). She died on 16 January 2005, at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, Welwyn Garden City, following a stroke. Hoddesdon parish church was packed for her funeral, as was Christ Church, Spitalfields, London, for her memorial service on 17 October that year. She was survived by her three children.<br>
