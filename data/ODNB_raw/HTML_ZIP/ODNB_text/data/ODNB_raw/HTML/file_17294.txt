<span class="headword">Lysaght,  Edward</span>  (1763&#150;1811), <span class="occ">poet and wit</span>, was born on 21 December 1763, the son of John Lysaght of Brickhill, co. Clare, a protestant gentleman, and Jane Eyre, daughter of Edward Dalton of Deerpark in the same county. He was educated at Dr Patrick Hare's school at Cashel, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA. His degree was incorporated at Oxford in 1787, and a year later he proceeded MA from St Edmund Hall, Oxford.<br>
<br>Lysaght complemented his academic work with legal study. In 1784 he became a student at the Middle Temple in London, and also at the King's Inns in Dublin. He was called to the English bar during the Easter term in 1788, and joined the profession in Ireland later that year. Initially, he practised English law, being employed as counsel in many election petitions, including, in 1784, the petition arising out of the celebrated Westminster contest with Charles James Fox.<br>
<br>Lysaght's legal career in London did not prosper, however, and he therefore decided in 1797&#150;8 to return to Ireland to become a member of the Munster circuit, where, for a time, he enjoyed a considerable practice, being appointed a commissioner of bankruptcy, and, later, a police magistrate for Dublin.<br>
<br>In Dublin, Lysaght also increasingly became a notable society figure, particularly in literary and theatrical circles, where he achieved a considerable reputation as a <i>bon vivant</i>, satiric wit, and improvisatore. At the time of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, he hired himself out as a political squib writer and pamphleteer, whose Swiftian anti-English satires in <span class="italic">The Lantern</span> made him enemies determined to blacken his name. Jonah Barrington, for example, states without authority in his <span class="italic">Personal Sketches</span> (1827&#150;32) that, although posing as an opponent of the Union, Lysaght in reality took money from Castlereagh to write in the government interest.<br>
<br>Lysaght did not, however, manage his money well, and his social popularity did not prevent him from dying impoverished in 1811. His collected poems were published in the year of his death, prefaced by a memoir. A subscription raised by the bench and bar of Ireland for the benefit of his widow and two daughters raised over &pound;2000. His patriotic ballads and often sentimental and bawdy love songs were also recalled with affection in Ireland throughout the nineteenth century, and were continually anthologized. Lysaght's wit was also not soon forgotten. In 1829, in Sydney Owenson's popular novel <span class="italic">The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys</span>, a flirtatious woman is informed that her behaviour warrants an epigram in the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> &#145;from Curran or Lysaght&#146;  (Deane, 2.870). Lysaght's most famous poem, &#145;The Man who Led the Van of the Irish Volunteers&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing</span>.<br>
