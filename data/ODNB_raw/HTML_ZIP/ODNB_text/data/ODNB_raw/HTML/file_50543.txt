<span class="headword">Blandford,  Thomas</span>  (1861&#150;1899), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist</span>, was born on 19 August 1861 in Curragh, co. Kildare, to a father of Scottish extraction and a mother of Irish descent. Blandford's parents are recorded in one source as strolling players and this is consistent with the limited record of his early life. The family settled in Newcastle upon Tyne where Blandford obtained employment in a warehouse. By 1881 he had moved to London, finding new opportunities both in employment&#151;he became a foreman in a wholesale house&#151;and in education. Blandford attended lectures at the Men's and Women's College, Queen Square, where his interest in economics was developed by James Bonar; such was his appetite for learning that he temporarily gave up his warehouse work to study in the British Museum.<br>
<br>Blandford's interest in labour conditions and co-operative production led him to join the Labour Association in 1885. This recently formed educational and propagandist body promoted principles of co-partnership including profit-sharing and worker participation in the ownership and administration of business. Blandford served as president of the association for two years and was vice-president at the time of his death. He was also involved in specific co-operative productive ventures, including the Co-operative Bookbinders and the London Productive Society. Blandford's perception of productive societies' need to display their output to potential customers led to involvement with the Co-operative Festivals Association which held its first annual event at Crystal Palace in 1888. Blandford also served on the Co-operative Congress Exhibitions committee which organized other festivals in northern and midland England and Scotland during the 1890s.<br>
<br>In 1894 Blandford took up a full-time post as the general secretary of the Co-operative Productive Federation, a group founded in 1882 and to which the Labour Association owed its origins. The federation aimed to assist producers' co-operatives, acting as a central agency providing capital and opening up markets for co-operative output. Initially its concrete achievements were few; under Blandford, however, the organization did begin to fulfil some of its original objectives. He established a loan department to assist the capitalization of producers' co-operatives, and had some success in reviving trade union support for such ventures. Blandford was also a relentless propagandist and spoke at over 200 trade union branches urging support for co-operative production. He was equally active in print, establishing <span class="italic">Labour Co-Partnership</span>, a monthly journal, in 1894 and producing the <span class="italic">Co-Operator's Year Book</span>. Producers' co-operation remained under-developed in Britain by comparison with the success of the consumers' movement. It did, however, undergo modest expansion in the later 1890s, with twenty new societies applying to join the Co-operative Productive Federation between 1896 and 1899. This revival of interest was at least in part associated with Blandford's charm, idealism, and energy in promoting the cause.<br>
<br>Blandford was involved in the international development of co-operation. By virtue of his birth he took an interest in the development of agricultural co-operation in Ireland. Blandford served as chairman of the trading relations committee of the International Co-operative Alliance and was delegated to attend congresses in Paris (1896) and Delft (1897). This, however, increased the strain on Blandford's health, and as early as 1897 friends expressed concerns about his physical well-being. He suffered from consumption and incipient heart disease, as well as the mental stress suffered by a private, contemplative man driven to a public role by a sense of duty. Blandford refused to curtail his work, and even while convalescing in Devon in 1899 visited trade union branches. He returned home to Camden Town while still far from recovered, and died there of influenza on 25 February 1899. He was buried in Highgate cemetery three days later. Blandford was unmarried; he was survived by a sister, also resident in London. On his death he was hailed as a martyr for co-operation, and his work was commemorated in the naming of the Blandford Congress Memorial Fund.<br>
