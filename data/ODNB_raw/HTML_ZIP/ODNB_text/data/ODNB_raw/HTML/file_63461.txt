<span class="headword">Sandford,  Daniel Arthur</span>  (1882&#150;1972), <span class="occ">army officer and adviser in Ethiopia</span>, was born at Landkey vicarage, south Devon, on 18 June 1882, one of the seven sons and two daughters of the Revd Ernest Grey Sandford (1839&#150;1910) and his wife, Ethel M. R. Poole. His father, who had been an Oxford athlete, and was later canon and archdeacon of Exeter, had served as chaplain to Archbishop Frederick Temple. As a result of this connection young Daniel, on attending St Paul's School, lived with the Temples at Fulham Palace. On finishing school he adopted a military career. He attended the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned in 1900 in the Royal Artillery. Transferred to India, he served in Bombay and Karachi until 1906. He was then posted to Aden, took a gunnery course in Britain, and returned to Aden in 1909. There, as a young subaltern, he took leave, sailed across the Gulf of Aden, and, entering Ethiopia, hired mules at Diredawa, and rode across the country to Sudan. These travels greatly enamoured him with Ethiopia, and made him determined to return to the country. This he did in 1910 when, joining the Sudan civil service as a contract officer, he was posted to the British legation in Addis Ababa.<br>
<br>Dan Sandford, as he was generally known, rejoined the army in 1913. He served in France, where he was wounded, mentioned in dispatches, and was made a member of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur and DSO and bar. On 14 November 1918 he married Christine (1893&#150;1975), daughter of Hubert Stanley Lush, a solicitor. The marriage, which was to last fifty-four years, was a happy one. Throughout her life Christine identified herself closely with her husband's career and interests. They had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In 1919 Sandford accompanied Lord Lugard on the latter's visit to Addis Ababa to inspect the work of a private British company, the Abyssinian Corporation, and was appointed its general manager. He held this post until the company's liquidation in 1921. By then deeply attracted by life in Ethiopia, he retired from the army in 1922 and leased a piece of land at Mulu, 30 miles north of Addis Ababa. Until the world slump of 1931, from which Ethiopia suffered greatly, he farmed at Mulu, grew strawberries for local sale, exported, mainly coffee and hides and skins, and for two years practised as an advocate.<br>
<br>In 1935, after Emperor Haile Selassie's accession to power and ensuing efforts to suppress slavery and the slave trade, the Ethiopian ruler appointed Sandford adviser to the Ethiopian governor of Maji. This territory, on the Kenyan border, was a major centre of the slave trade which the emperor wished to suppress, and was planned by him to become a model province. However, not long after Sandford's arrival there, fascist Italy began its brutal invasion of Ethiopia. Learning of the emperor's defeat and departure for Europe, Sandford made his way south to Kenya, and returned to England where, through his Church of England connections, he became appeals secretary for Guildford Cathedral.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Sandford joined the officers' emergency reserve, and was shortly afterwards sent to Cairo as a member of the Middle East intelligence centre. There, as an expert on Ethiopia, he was involved in planning British support for the Ethiopian patriots, who had been resisting the Italians for over four years. After Mussolini's declaration of war on Britain and France in June 1940, Sandford, then aged fifty-eight, entered Ethiopia's Gojjam province on 12 August with the rank of colonel as head of the British &#145;Mission 101&#146;. Its object was to encourage and unify the efforts of the Ethiopian patriots, and thereby tie down the Italian forces. The latter then enjoyed considerable numerical superiority over the British and for a time seemed to threaten the entire British position in east Africa. Sandford's mission, though sometimes almost forgotten by the British higher commands in Cairo and Khartoum, was a considerable success: it laid the basis for the subsequent visit of another British officer, Colonel Orde Wingate, who was flown into Gojjam on 20 November 1940, and hence also for the emperor's arrival in the province from Sudan on 30 January 1941.<br>
<br>After Haile Selassie's return to Addis Ababa on 5 May 1941, and Wingate's departure shortly afterwards, Sandford became, unofficially, the emperor's principal foreign adviser. This was a difficult position in that the interests and policies of the British and Ethiopian governments often greatly diverged. Sandford's brother-in-law, Brigadier Maurice Lush, was then deputy British political officer for British-occupied Ethiopia, and Sandford's loyalties were inevitably divided. His position as adviser was, however, formalized in May of the following year when, following the signing of the Anglo-Ethiopian treaty of 31 January 1942, he was officially appointed adviser to the Ethiopian ministry of the interior. He was in 1945 made director-general of the Addis Ababa municipality, a position which he held until 1948.<br>
<br>Sandford retired from Ethiopian government service in 1948, devoting his energies thereafter to his farm at Mulu, which after the emperor's restoration had once again been leased to him. He also took an interest in Addis Ababa's English School (later the Sandford School), which his wife Christine had founded in 1942, and which was reckoned the best private secondary school in the country. He died on 22 January 1972 at his home, Mulu Farm, Ethiopia, and was buried on 24 January at the Commonwealth war cemetery in Addis Ababa, in the presence of the emperor.<br>
