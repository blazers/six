<span class="headword">Ballantine <span class="st"> [Bannatyne]</span>,  William</span>  (1617/18&#150;1661), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was probably born at North Berwick, Haddingtonshire, the second son of Thomas Ballantine 
    (or Bannatyne; <i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1574, <i>d</i>. in or before 1639)
  , Church of Scotland minister, and Margaret Cockburn, his wife. From 1621 his father was minister of Douglas, Lanarkshire, where William had his schooling until in 1635 he matriculated at Edinburgh University. He did not graduate but travelled on the continent and became a Catholic in Paris. Having been a student at the Scots College there, he entered the Scots College, Rome, in 1641. He completed his studies with distinction, was ordained priest on 3 December 1645 and in March 1646 went to Paris to prepare for missionary work. After arriving in Scotland in January 1649, he quickly realized the need for some co-ordination among the secular priests, who were few in number and lacking in cohesion compared with the Jesuits. After only a short stay he went to Paris, where he conferred with five other secular priests. It was decided to petition the congregation of Propaganda in Rome to provide a superior and financial help, with William Leslie (one of them) acting as their Roman agent. Ballantine returned to Scotland in February 1650 and was appointed prefect of the Scottish secular priests on 13 October 1653. He lived with the marquess of Huntly.<br>
<br>About this time Ballantine journeyed to France and back. When he went again in the summer of 1656 he was arrested on his return to England in September and held in confinement in London for twenty-two months. He apparently established friendly relations with the secretary of state, John Thurloe, while Cromwell seemed interested in using his services and indeed paid for his journey to France when he was banished in July 1658.<br>
<br>Ballantine was then prefect of studies in the Scots College, Paris, and during this time he compiled a spiritual work, <span class="italic">A Preparation for Death</span> (1672, reprinted 1715) from the writings of a French Jesuit, Jean Suffren. In May 1660, having written a full report for Propaganda, he returned to Scotland and lived in Elgin with the widowed marchioness of Huntly. He fell ill in July 1661 and died, at Elgin, six weeks later on 2 September aged forty-three. After funeral rites in the house the body was taken in a torchlight procession to Elgin Cathedral and buried in the Huntly aisle. Quite remarkably, the Elgin magistrates and a large gathering attended the funeral.<br>
<br>Though described as tall and comely, Ballantine was apparently not robust and he never recovered from his confinement in London. He comes across as a spiritual man as well as being liked and respected. Although he made a number of notable converts while in Scotland, he realized that the greatest need was to build up an organized body of priests and accordingly he made journeys to Paris for business and sent students there. The editor of his book declared that &#145;his Memory ought to be in perpetual Benediction, amongst all good Catholicks of this Kingdom&#146;  (preface to W. Ballantine, <span class="italic">A Preparation for Death</span>, 1715, x).<br>
