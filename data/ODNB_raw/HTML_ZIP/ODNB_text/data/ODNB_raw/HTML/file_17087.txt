<span class="headword">Lowe,  Richard Thomas</span>  (1802&#150;1874), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 4 December 1802 in Derbyshire, the only child of Thomas Lowe (<i>d</i>. 1803/4), a naval officer, and his wife, Susanna Dorothy (1778/9&#150;1841). He was educated at Brewood School, Staffordshire, and in 1821 entered Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1825 he graduated BA as senior optime, and in the same year took holy orders. In 1831 he graduated MA, and in 1843 was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford. At university he acquired a fondness for natural history from his friend, the botanist Miles Joseph Berkeley (1803&#150;1889), who introduced him to the professor of mineralogy at Cambridge, John Stevens Henslow (1796&#150;1861). Henslow, a founder of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, was responsible for organizing botanizing tours of the local countryside for a number of students, including Charles Darwin (a devoted beetle hunter) and Lowe's lifelong friend, the entomologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29840/', "Thomas Vernon Wollaston (1822&#150;1878)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1827 Lowe was awarded a travelling bachelorship for a year. It enabled him to visit Madeira with his mother in May 1828&#151;a visit partly intended to improve his health. On arriving at Funchal Lowe took up rooms at the Quinta da Lavada, and soon began attending the English church there. His botanical field trips and collecting of specimens began almost immediately. He sent copies of his work, along with specimens, to the professor of botany at Glasgow, William Jackson Hooker (1785&#150;1865).<br>
<br>In 1830 Lowe returned to England owing to his mother's ill health, and in November that year the Cambridge Philosophical Society agreed to publish his work, &#145;Primitiae faunae et florae Maderae et Portus Sancti&#146;, in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In January the following year he returned to Madeira, again accompanied by his mother. Soon after arriving he was offered the chance to stand in for the Anglican chaplain, and about 1832/3 he took up the post on a permanent basis. On reading <span class="italic">Tract Number One</span>, a pamphlet of the Oxford Movement, Lowe became the cause's first and most &#145;notorious&#146; combatant abroad. His support for the movement and Tractarianism led him into a prolonged conflict both at home and with a number of his fellow islanders on Madeira.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1835 Lowe once again visited England. He published papers on the flora of Madeira in several periodicals; his &#145;Novitiae florae Maderensis&#146; (1838), also published in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Philosophical Transactions</span>, was perhaps his most valuable contribution. Lowe's mother died in 1841. In 1843 he again returned to England, to organize the publication of his work <span class="italic">A History of the Fishes of Madeira</span> (1843). While in England, on 5 July 1843, he married Catherine Maria (<i>bap</i>. 1802, <i>d</i>. 1874), eldest of seven children of the Revd Joseph Guerin (<i>d</i>. 1863), rector of Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>In January 1844 Lowe and his wife travelled to Madeira. In the winter of 1847 Wollaston visited the island, and accompanied Lowe on one of his explorations of its flora and fauna. While Lowe worked on describing new species, Wollaston concentrated on examining species variation and distribution. Lowe was still embroiled in conflict with some of his parishioners, and with the church in England&#151;a situation which Queen Adelaide attempted to resolve during her 1847 visit to the island. However, on 22 December Lord Palmerston removed Lowe from his position as chaplain, to be replaced by Thomas Kenworthy Brown within a couple of months. On 28 March 1852 Lowe and his wife sailed back to England.<br>
<br>On his return to England Lowe accepted the living at Lea, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, given to him by Sir Charles Anderson, a cousin of his wife. Wollaston was a frequent visitor to Lea, and Lowe also paid visits to his botanist friend Berkeley, who lived nearby at King's Cliffe. Lowe made a further journey to Madeira in January 1855, returning to England in August the same year. At Lea he set to work on <span class="italic">A Manual Flora of Madeira and the Adjacent Islands of Porto Santo and the Desertas</span>, of which the first part of volume one appeared in 1857; the fifth (and concluding) part of the volume appeared in 1868. In August 1857 Lowe returned to Madeira to collect more botanical specimens. He made further journeys to his beloved island and its neighbours in 1860, 1863, 1865, and 1871. He also made trips to the Cape Verde and Canary Islands. He continued work on his <span class="italic">Manual Flora of Madeira</span>, but did not publish more than the first part of the second volume, which was issued in 1872.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1874 Lowe and his wife sailed from Liverpool for Madeira on the steamship <i>Liberia</i>. However, the ship never reached its destination. In the following month the <i>Volta</i> arrived in Liverpool with news of <i>Liberia</i> wreckage observed 200 miles off the Isles of Scilly; it was assumed that the <i>Liberia</i> sank with all hands at some time between 11 April and mid-May 1874. Wollaston, as executor of Lowe's will, carried out his friend's wishes to destroy all his notes (scientific and religious), but Lowe's botanical collection was presented to the herbarium at Kew, and the British Museum. The botanist John Lindley (1799&#150;1865) dedicated the rosaceous genus <i>Lowea</i> (which has subsequently been absorbed in <span class="italic">Hulthemia</span>) to him, and a memorial was erected in the English cemetery at Funchal, in honour of both Lowe and his wife.<br>
