<span class="headword">Fennell,  John Greville</span>  (1807&#150;1885), <span class="occ">artist and writer on angling</span>, was born at sea between Ireland and England. He began his artistic career by winning the silver medal offered by the duke of Sussex for a drawing of Hercules. He was a student at the school of engraving run by the Finden brothers, and met Hablot K. Browne (Phiz). As a young man Fennell found his humorous paintings sold well but later in life he was fonder of landscapes. In some of these, however, he was very careless, and his work was always uneven. He drew pictures of the tournament at Eglinton Castle for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. His interest in natural history displayed itself chiefly in observations on the habits of fish and waterside birds. These he carried on while angling, of which he was an excellent practitioner. He was especially fond of the Thames and his writings helped to popularize coarse fishing there. He was a member of the <span class="italic">Field</span> staff from the start of that paper in 1853, and, as Greville F., wrote regularly on fishing subjects; he was also a frequent contributor, as Creel, to the <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> and other sporting papers on angling and outdoor pursuits. In 1870 he wrote <span class="italic">The Book of the Roach</span>, an exhaustive treatise on angling for that fish. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Rail and the Rod</span>, a guidebook to the angling resorts within 60 to 80 miles of London which could be reached by railway.<br>
<br>Fennell was never so happy as when relating to a circle of friends reminiscences of Dickens, Thackeray, Douglas Jerrold, Mackay, and Harrison Ainsworth, with all of whom he had been on intimate terms. Indeed he wrote the angling portions of Dickens's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Thames</span>. He was a freemason. He lived long at Barnes, and late in life at Henley-on-Thames. Fennell died suddenly at his home, Jessamine Cottage, Church Street, Rotherfield Greys, near Henley, on 13 January 1885. He was buried in Trinity churchyard, Henley. His widow, Sarah Florence Savage Fennell, and their daughters survived him. His epitaph from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> was appropriate: &#145;The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament&#146;.<br>
