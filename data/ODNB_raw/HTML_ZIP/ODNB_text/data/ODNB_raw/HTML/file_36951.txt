<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Charles William</span>  (1836&#150;1905), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at 8 Wesley Street, Princes Park, Liverpool, on 14 March 1836, was second son of Edward Wilson JP and his wife, Frances, daughter of Thomas Stokes of Hean Castle, Pembrokeshire, which Edward Wilson later bought from his wife's brother. Charles began his education at St David's School, Pembrokeshire, in 1844, then spent seven years at Liverpool Collegiate Institution (1845&#150;52), and two years at Cheltenham College, which he left as head of the military and civil department in June 1854. He then had a year at Bonn University. Because of the Crimean War a special open competitive army examination was held on 1 August 1855; Wilson, youngest of forty-six candidates, passed second to Robert Murdoch Smith. The two obtained the only commissions given in the Royal Engineers, Wilson becoming lieutenant on 24 September 1855.<br>
<br>After instruction at Chatham, Wilson was posted to Shorncliffe in April 1857. From 16 October 1857 he was employed on the construction of defences at Gosport. In February 1858 he was made secretary and transport officer of the commission to delimitate the boundary between the Canadian colonies and the United States, along the 49th parallel from Boundary Bay to the eastern Rocky Mountains at 114&deg; W longitude. With Captain J. S. Hawkins RE, the British commissioner, Wilson arrived, via Col&oacute;n and Panama at Esquimalt, on Vancouver Island, on 12 July. For the next four years Wilson was engaged in marking a straight boundary through swamp, prairie, and primeval forests, over mountains and in an extreme climate. Astronomical stations were constructed at suitable points. The field work was completed at the end of 1861 in the hardest winter known, with temperatures falling to -30&deg; F at night. The commission reached England on 14 July 1862 to draw up the reports and plans.<br>
<br>After eighteen months on the Thames and Medway defences, and being promoted captain on 20 June 1864, Wilson volunteered to survey Jerusalem and the surrounding country as part of a scheme for provision of pure water. The secretary of state for war had agreed to appoint an engineer officer, without paying his expenses. Several officers refused the post, but Wilson reached Jerusalem on 3 October 1864, and the work progressed steadily. At the request of Colonel Sir Henry James, director of the Ordnance Survey, he ran a line of levels to ascertain the difference in height between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. He returned home in July 1865. This survey led Sir George Grove to initiate a scientific exploration of the Holy Land by the formation of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Wilson became its first director and undertook the preliminary work, starting for Palestine on 8 November 1865. A general reconnaissance which he made of the country from Beirut via Damascus to Hebron showed how little was known of the antiquities of Palestine. Elected a member of the executive committee of the fund on his return in June 1866, Wilson continued one of its most energetic supporters, becoming chairman in 1901.<br>
<br>From October 1866 to October 1868 Wilson was at Inverness in charge of the Ordnance Survey in Scotland. He was also, in the summer of 1867, an assistant commissioner, under the Parliamentary Boundary Commission, in the English west midlands. He married in London on 22 January 1867, Olivia (<i>d</i>. 19 May 1911), daughter of Colonel Adam Duffin of the 2nd Bengal cavalry, and they established their home at Blythfield near Inverness. They had four sons and a daughter. Between October 1868 and May 1869 Wilson was surveying the Sinai peninsula, coverage of which was very defective on existing maps.<br>
<br>On 16 May 1869 Wilson was appointed executive officer of the small and moribund topographical and statistical department (under Sir Henry James of the Ordnance Survey) of the War Office. Appalled at its condition, he recommended change. In 1870 the department was separated from the Ordnance Survey, and he became the former's director. Supported by Cardwell he restructured and revived the department, improving its (non-covert) collection, analysis, and distribution of military intelligence. Following Wilson's suggestion, and the Prussian victory over France, Cardwell in 1873 established the intelligence branch of the War Office. Wilson's department was incorporated in it and Wilson became the deputy, designated an assistant adjutant-general, to its chief (Major-General Sir Patrick MacDougal), and contributed to its improvement.<br>
<br>From August 1876 until 1879 Wilson was director of the Ordnance Survey in Ireland. Promoted major on 23 May 1873, he was created CB, civil division, in 1877. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, in 1872 became a member of council of the society, and in 1874 was elected FRS. In 1875 he completed a map of Afghanistan for the India Office. The autumn of 1878 Wilson spent in Serbia as British commissioner of the international commission to demarcate the new frontier under the treaty of Berlin, and in February 1879 he was appointed British military consul-general in Anatolia, as part of Disraeli's anti-Russian strategy of military support to Turkey. Wilson was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel for his services in Serbia (19 April 1879). From headquarters at Sivas, Wilson divided Anatolia into four consulates, each with a military vice-consul. He travelled much in Anatolia, reporting to the Foreign Office through the British ambassador at Constantinople. Much of his data on the area he embodied in handbooks for <span class="italic">Asia Minor</span> and <span class="italic">Constantinople</span> (1892, 1895). In summer 1880, directed by G. J. Goschen, special ambassador to the Porte, Wilson investigated the situation in Eastern Rumelia, Bulgaria, and Macedonia  (&#145;Further correspondence&#146;). He returned to Anatolia in November. In 1881 he was created a KCMG for services in Asia Minor and Eastern Rumelia.<br>
<br>In August 1882 Wilson was summoned to Egypt to serve under Sir Edward Malet, the British consul-general. He arrived at Alexandria on 3 September 1882, when the British army was in the field against Arabi Pasha. He was next appointed military attach&eacute; to the British agency in Egypt, and took charge of the Egyptian prisoners of war, including Arabi Pasha. Wilson watched for the British government the trial of Arabi and his associates, and later arranged for sending the exiles to Ceylon. Resuming his duties on 1 April 1883 at the head of the Ordnance Survey in Ireland, he was promoted brevet colonel on the 19th, and was made an honorary DCL of Oxford in June.<br>
<br>Appointed chief of the intelligence department in the Gordon relief expedition of September 1884, Wilson reached Dongola on 11 October, and on 15 December, accompanied Lord Wolseley to Korti. Later in December he was in the desert column, commanded by Sir Herbert Stewart. After the death of Burnaby, Stewart's designated successor, and the fatal wounding of Stewart on 18 January, command devolved on Wilson, who had never commanded troops in action. He delayed, apparently unnecessarily, sending the steamers, with a small force, upriver to Khartoum. The steamers left on 24 January, Khartoum fell and Gordon was killed on the 26th, and the steamers arrived there on the 28th, then withdrew.<br>
<br>In the bitter controversy over the failure to save Gordon, Wilson was both blamed and defended. Even before the news of Gordon's death, Wolseley believed &#145;Wilson has proved a great failure as a soldier&#146;  (Preston, 128), and others who blamed him included Evelyn Baring and Charles Williams, the war correspondent (notably in &#145;How we lost Gordon&#146;, <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, May 1885). Among those who publicly defended him was Lord Hartington, the war minister, and in 1885 he was made KCB, military division. He published his own version in <span class="italic">From Korti to Khartum</span> (1885). A more effective commander might have saved Gordon. However, Wilson's delay was only the last and the shortest in the series of delays caused by Gladstone, Wolseley, Buller, and others: if Wilson was to blame, he was not solely to blame. Queen Victoria, who blamed Gladstone for Gordon's death, summoned Wilson to tell her his story. In the spring of 1886 he was made an honorary LLD of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Wilson resumed his Ordnance Survey work in Ireland on 1 July 1885. In November 1886 he was appointed director-general of the Ordnance Survey in the United Kingdom, and saw out his service at Southampton. Normally, as colonel, he would have retired in early 1893, but was retained a further year. He was president of the geographical section of the British Association at Bath in 1888. From November 1889 he served a year on the council of the Royal Society. In 1893 he was given the temporary rank, then on 15 February 1894 the permanent rank, of major-general. From the end of 1894 to 14 March 1898 he was director-general of military education at the War Office.<br>
<br>In February 1899, and in March 1904, he revisited Palestine and devoted much time to the controversy over the sites of Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre. He published his arguments in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Statements of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span> (1902&#150;4), which he edited, then in <span class="italic">Golgotha and the Holy Sepulchre</span> (1906). His other publications included contributions to reference works and the reviews. After an operation he died at his home, 16 Calverley Crescent, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 25 October 1905, and was buried at Tunbridge Wells.<br>
