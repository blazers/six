<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Bartholomew</span>  (1772&#150;1837), <span class="occ">college head</span>, born at New Ross, co. Wexford, on 5 February 1772, was descended from a Welsh family which, about the end of the seventeenth century, settled in co. Wexford. He was the eldest son of Humphrey Lloyd (1735&#150;1786), himself the son of the Revd Bartholomew Lloyd of the Abbey House of New Ross. His father died while he was still a boy, and an uncle, the Revd John Lloyd, rector of Ferns and Kilbride, to whose care he had been committed, did not long survive, so that he was left to struggle for himself. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1787 as a pensioner. In 1790 he gained first scholarship, in 1792 graduated BA, and in 1796 obtained a junior fellowship on passing a remarkably high examination. He graduated MA in the same year, BD in 1805, and DD in 1808. In July 1799 he married Eleanor, daughter of Patrick McLaughlin of Dublin, and had a family of four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In 1813 Lloyd was appointed Erasmus Smith's professor of mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin, on the resignation of William Magee, afterwards archbishop of Dublin. In 1822 came a further appointment, as Erasmus Smith's professor of natural and experimental philosophy in succession to William Davenport. His publications, <span class="italic">A Treatise on Analytic Geometry</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">An Elementary Treatise of Mechanical Philosophy</span> (1826), were not the result of original work. In both his chairs, however, he introduced radical change into the methods of teaching. Immediately after his appointment to the mathematics chair, he began to bring in the new analytical methods of French mathematics. In revolutionizing the curriculum, he has been reckoned &#145;the founder of the distinguished Dublin mathematical school of the nineteenth century&#146;  (McDowell and Webb, 159). His versatility and the wide range of his attainments are shown by the facts that in 1821 and again in 1823 and 1825 he was elected regius professor of Greek in the university, and in 1823 and again in 1827 Archbishop King's lecturer in divinity. His <span class="italic">Discourses, Chiefly Doctrinal, Delivered in the Chapel of Trinity College, Dublin</span> were published in 1822.<br>
<br>In 1831 Lloyd was elected provost of the college, in succession to Samuel Kyle. He embarked on a programme of academic reform including the foundation of new chairs, and alterations in the tenure of existing chairs to allow holders more opportunity to undertake advanced teaching and original work. A new undergraduate course in logic and ethics was introduced. His reorganization of the academic year and establishment of a division between pass and honours courses lasted for over a century.<br>
<br>The magnetic observatory of the college was founded through Lloyd's influence. In 1835 he was appointed president of the Royal Irish Academy, in the affairs of which he took an active interest; and in the same year he acted as president of the British Association meeting at Dublin. His inaugural address dealt mainly with &#145;the correspondence of the objects of science with divine revelation&#146;. His house in Dublin was a meeting place for men of science. Lloyd died suddenly in Dublin of apoplexy on 24 November 1837, and was buried in the chapel of his college. The Lloyd exhibitions were founded by subscription in 1839 in his memory. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16840/', "Humphrey Lloyd")</script>, became provost of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1867.<br>
