<span class="headword">Mead,  Robert</span>  (1615/16&#150;1653), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born at the Black Lion, Fleet Street, London, the son of Robert Mead (<i>d</i>. 1658), who was later four times master of the Stationers' Company (1644&#150;5, 1645&#150;6, 1649&#150;50, and 1656&#150;7). The younger Mead was educated at Westminster School, where he became a king's scholar in 1630. In 1633 he contributed a commendatory sonnet to his schoolfellow Abraham Cowley's <span class="italic">Poetical Blossomes</span>. In the following year, at the age of eighteen, he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, from where he graduated BA on 11 April 1638 and proceeded MA on 22 May 1641.<br>
<br>While at Oxford Mead wrote a comedy entitled &#145;The combat of love and friendship&#146;. The play was acted by the students at Christ Church, but was not printed until after Mead's death. The address to the reader prefixed to the 1654 edition indicates that Mead wrote the play &#145;when his youth was willing to descend from his then higher Contemplations&#146;  (Mead, sig. A2<i>r</i>), which implies a date of composition between 1634 and 1638. The comedy details the struggle of Lysander to remain loyal to his best friend and faithful to his mistress. Forced to choose between the two, the hero opts to deceive his mistress, but is then betrayed by his friend. The play ends happily when the hero himself proves unfaithful, allowing a series of pragmatic marriages to take place. In 1638 a poem by Mead was included in <span class="italic">Death Repeal'd</span>, a volume of verse published by Christ Church students in remembrance of Viscount Bayning of Sudbury. The same year Mead contributed a further elegy, &#145;Our bayes (me thinks) are withered&#146;, to <span class="italic">Jonsonus virbius</span>, a poetical miscellany published as a tribute to the late Ben Jonson.<br>
<br>From 1639 Mead appears to have relinquished literature. In 1640 he was made a captain in Charles I's army. He later distinguished himself at the siege of Oxford, took part in the assault on Abingdon in the spring of 1646, and was one of the commissioners for negotiating the surrender of Oxford to parliament in May 1646. He was created MD on 23 June 1646, the day before the surrender, but was later expelled from his studentship by the parliamentary commission of 1648. Eager to continue in the king's service, Mead travelled to Ireland, where he served briefly in the Munster forces under Lord Inchiquin. Following the defeat of Inchiquin's troops, Mead travelled to Jersey, and soon afterwards proceeded to G&ouml;teborg in Sweden as Charles II's agent. From there he wrote to Sir Edward Nicholas in February 1650, expressing Queen Kristina's dissatisfaction at hearing so little of the king's activities. He subsequently submitted a diplomatic note from Charles to the queen, and entered into Charles's project of visiting Stockholm. In 1651 Lord Inchiquin appears to have appointed Mead his son's tutor. In 1652 Mead travelled up the Rhine into Switzerland, and then via Strasbourg, Speyer, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Mainz to Cologne. In a letter to Edgeman dated September 1652, but wrongly transcribed as 1654 in the Clarendon state papers, Mead offers a brief account of his travels. He next sailed from Amsterdam to England, where he lodged at his father's house in Fleet Street. There Mead himself fell victim to a malignant fever. He died on 21 February 1653 and was buried two days later in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>Mead's friends attempted to secure for him a posthumous reputation as a gifted poet and playwright. Removed from the historical context of late Caroline England, Mead's published writings fail to substantiate this claim. However, for his contemporaries at Oxford, Mead's reputation for talent and discernment may well have owed as much to his political allegiance as his literary ability. As the anonymous publisher of Mead's <span class="italic">The Combat of Love and Friendship</span> (1654) explains, Mead was &#145;a stout and learned man, and excellent in the faculty of poetry and making plays. His eminent general abilities were also such that they have left him a character precious and honourable to our nation&#146;  (Mead, sig. A2<i>r</i>).<br>
