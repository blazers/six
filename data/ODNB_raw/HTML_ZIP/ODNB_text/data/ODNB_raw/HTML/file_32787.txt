<span class="headword">Dent,  Edward Joseph</span>  (1876&#150;1957), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born at Ribston Hall, Wetherby, Yorkshire, on 16 July 1876, the fourth and youngest son of John Dent, barrister and for many years an MP, and his wife, Mary Hebden, daughter of John Woodall, of Scarborough. A scholar at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, Dent gained a third class in part one of the classical tripos in 1898. However, he had studied music, at which he excelled, at Eton under C. H. Lloyd; and at Cambridge, where he was a pupil of Charles Wood and Charles Stanford, he gained the MusB in 1899. From 1902 to 1908 he was a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and lectured on music history, also teaching harmony, counterpoint, and composition. During this time he became absorbed in research on Alessandro Scarlatti, who was the subject of <span class="italic">Alessandro Scarlatti</span> (1905), his first book and perhaps his most notable achievement. This research was based largely on the study of manuscripts, involving travel throughout Italy, and was followed soon afterwards by major articles on Leonardo Leo, eighteenth-century Italian opera in general, and Orazio Vecchi's <span class="italic">Amfiparnaso</span>. These publications established Dent as the leading British musicologist of his day, and the first to gain an international reputation.<br>
<br>Following Charles Wood's death in 1926, Dent was appointed professor of music at Cambridge University, a post which he held until 1941. He was responsible for reorganizing the teaching of music on a broader basis, as the prerogative not only of organists and organ scholars but of those interested in all branches of music. He particularly encouraged performances of early music, especially baroque. His interests focused on Scarlatti; seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italian opera, on which he published articles in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, the second edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, and the Riemann Festschrift of 1909; and Mozart. His <span class="italic">Mozart's Operas</span> (1913), published at a time when most of Mozart's operas were still almost completely unknown in England, became the standard work in any language on this subject and demonstrated Dent's ability to form keen critical judgements on the basis of close scholarship. Opera meant more to Dent than any other form of music. He made new translations of Mozart's <span class="italic">Le nozze di Figaro</span>, <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>, and <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span>, and supervised a celebrated student production of the last of these at Cambridge in 1911. His later translations included several of Verdi's operas, Berlioz's <span class="italic">Les Troyens</span>, and Beethoven's <span class="italic">Fidelio</span>. He also edited many of Purcell's works and produced these at Cambridge, the Old Vic, the Glastonbury festival, and elsewhere; he made a new edition of <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> in 1924.<br>
<br>From 1919 Dent was the music critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, remaining after its amalgamation in 1921 into <span class="italic">The Nation and Athenaeum</span> (until 1924). He was also active in the formation of the British Music Society. But he remained essentially international in outlook. He was responsible for the fact that the International Festival of Contemporary Chamber Music, held in 1922 at Salzburg, developed into the International Society of Contemporary Music; this body has branches in many countries and gives annual festivals of modern music. He became its first president, a post he held until 1938 and again in 1945&#150;7. In 1927 he became vice-president of the newly formed International Society for Musicology, of which he later became president. He also served on the board of directors of Sadler's Wells Theatre, of which he became a governor. When the Covent Garden Opera Trust was set up in 1946 he became a director and showed a very active interest in presenting opera of all kinds in English. In 1950 he became the first president of the Liszt Society.<br>
<br>Dent had a strong rebellious streak, and delighted in expressing outrageous opinions about music that he felt had been accepted with unthinking reverence. His chapter on modern English music in Guido Adler's <span class="italic">Handbuch der Musikgeschichte</span> (1924; 2nd edn, 1930) caused some controversy, as he devoted considerably more space to the music of Sir Hubert Parry and Sir Charles Stanford than to that of Sir Edward Elgar, writing that &#145;for English ears Elgar's music is too emotional and not quite free from vulgarity&#146;. In 1931 a protest against Dent's remarks, signed by many well-known musicians and others, was sent to the Press Association, leading to a flood of highly charged correspondence in various papers. For the 1929 edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford History of Music</span> Dent wrote a chapter entitled &#145;Social aspects of music in the middle ages&#146;, and he later served on the editorial board of the <span class="italic">New Oxford History of Music</span>. He was an honorary doctor of music of Oxford (1932), Harvard (1936), and Cambridge (1947) universities. He was also, in 1953, one of the first two musicians elected a fellow of the British Academy. His other books include <span class="italic">Foundations of English Opera</span> (1928) and a masterly biography of Ferruccio Busoni (1933), a composer whom he knew well as a personal friend. His prolific writings included many articles, forewords to books, and programme notes.<br>
<br>Dent composed a few original works, of which the most important are a set of polyphonic motets. He also made an arrangement of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> and a practical edition of one of the earliest oratorios, the sacred drama <span class="italic">La rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo</span> of Emilio de' Cavalieri. His scholarship was a living activity; he was always interested in promoting live performances of music which interested him, not merely in writing articles about it in learned journals. He revived a great deal of early music at a time when there was relatively little interest in it, while at the same time being keenly involved in contemporary music. He left his mark on many fields of music, not only in Cambridge, but in the whole international scene. In recognition of his contribution to musicology the Royal Musical Association, of which he was president from 1928 to 1935, instituted the Dent medal, which is awarded annually to recipients selected for outstanding achievement in this field. Dent, who was unmarried, died at his London home, 17 Cromwell Place, on 22 August 1957.<br>
