<span class="headword">Manuche,  Cosmo</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1673?), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was baptized on 24 October 1613 at St Andrew's, Holborn, in the liberties of the City of London, the eldest surviving son of James Manuche (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;1633), a painter, and Katherine, who lived near the Windmill in Shoe Lane, Holborn. His grandfather Jacomo Manuche (<i>d</i>. 1593), first went to England some time before 1573 and worked for many years in England and abroad in Sir Francis Walsingham's intelligence-gathering network. In 1577 he was rewarded by the queen with a &pound;40 annuity for life. James Manuche, a middle child of Jacomo, was a member of the Painters' Stainers' Guild, having been apprenticed to John de Critz the elder about 1610.<br>
<br>In 1626 Cosmo Manuche entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, a few years after John Webster, the future dramatist, whose family were near neighbours of the Manuches in Shoe Lane. He probably would have left school in 1631 or 1632. There is no record that Cosmo Manuche matriculated at either Oxford or Cambridge, the course one might expect, but it must be admitted that university registers for this period are notoriously incomplete. Family difficulties may have prevented him. On 7 March 1633 his father, James Manuche, &#145;a man a painter&#146;, was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, &#145;out [of] his house near the Windmill in Shoe Lane&#146;  (parish register, St Andrew's, Holborn, Guildhall Library). There is evidence that Cosmo Manuche continued to live in the family home in Shoe Lane in the early 1630s, and on 19 January 1636 he married Anne Cooley (<i>d</i>. 1641) at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. There is no record of any children of the couple being baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn. They almost certainly continued to live there, for when Anne was buried on 11 April 1641 she was buried in this parish. On 27 October 1648 in the parish of St Bartholomew-the-Less, London, Manuche married his second wife, Frances Brewster. There were certainly offspring from this marriage, as Manuche says in the dedication to the earl of Northampton of his play <span class="italic">The Feast</span> (<i>c</i>.1664) that the manuscript is being carried by his daughters and he hopes Northampton will be able to help them to get on in the world.<br>
<br>When the civil war broke out Manuche joined the forces of the king. Surviving records indicate that he was a serving officer, probably of a company of foot initially, from 1642 until at least 1645, though there is circumstantial evidence that he continued serving until the final collapse of the king's cause. Whatever his initial rank, he eventually rose to the rank of major. On 19 October 1645 Major Cosmo Manuche and Lieutenant Francis Manuche, probably a cousin, and serving under the ultimate command of Sir John Berkeley, governor of Exeter, were taken prisoner by the army of Sir Thomas Fairfax at the siege of Tiverton. However, Cosmo Manuche must have been soon released or exchanged, for on 12 December 1661 Lord John Berkeley of Stratton, Sir Gilbert Talbot, and Sir Lewis Dyves, his commanders in the west during the civil war, testified that he continued to fight in Ireland and the Isles of Scilly for as long as any sort of armed resistance lasted  (BL, Egerton MS 2623, fol. 34).<br>
<br>What happened to Manuche after the final defeat of the royalists is not clear, but it seems likely that he had some patronage from the earl of Northampton, although Northampton too was suffering from the deprivations laid on him by parliament. Another play, <span class="italic">Love in Travell</span> (<i>c</i>.1650), a tragicomedy, was dedicated to Northampton:<blockquote>The former favours I have received by your honours free and noble acceptation of my weak endeavours (the productions of a disturbed brain, through want); in point of gratitude and duty (with my soul's affection), could no less than present the first fruits of my last endeavour to your honour. (BL, Add. MS 60275, fol. 3<i>r</i>)</blockquote>This dedication indicates a previous connection, and all of Manuche's known works, save <span class="italic">The Bastard</span> (1652), are dedicated to Lord or Lady Northampton, or both together.<br>
<br>There is an implication in the testimony of his former commanders given on 12 December 1661 (previously cited) that Manuche was imprisoned in London several times in the 1650s, but what is certainly known is that he published three plays in 1652: <span class="italic">The Bastard</span>, <span class="italic">The Loyal Lovers</span>, and <span class="italic">The Just General</span>, the first a tragedy and the latter two tragicomedies. Various entries in the state papers suggest that Manuche boarded, and perhaps taught, scholars in the country, possibly in Kent, between 1652 and 1656. But Manuche, clearly in need of funds, followed the example of some other royalists and made a sort of peace with the interregnum government. On 4 June 1656 &#145;Capt.&#146; Cosmo Manuche petitioned Cromwell for money for having turned in several seditious persons. He was paid &pound;10 for his &#145;publique service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655&#150;6</i>).<br>
<br>In 1659 and early 1660 Manuche composed <span class="italic">The Banished Shepherdess</span>, a political pastoral comedy about the impending restoration of Charles II. In the play the dowager queen, Henrietta Maria, is the banished shepherdess and her son Charles II is Charilaus, but the composition cannot be later than the early spring of 1660 since the restoration is hinted at but clearly has not happened yet. Manuche produced two very careful presentation copies in his own hand, one for Henrietta Maria  (Hunt. L., MS EL 8395) and one for the earl of Northampton  (BL, Add. MS 60273). When Charles II offered small financial rewards for those officers who had served the crown loyally during the civil war, one who came forward was Cosmo Manuche on 27 June 1661, when he was awarded &pound;20 (<span class="italic">Treasury Books</span>).<br>
<br>Manuche's sixth and last play, another tragicomedy, is <span class="italic">The Feast</span> (BL, Add. MS 60274; Worcester College, Oxford). Its date of composition can be no earlier than January 1665 since it contains references to Sir Samuel Tuke's <span class="italic">Adventures of Five Hours</span>, performed either on 15 or 23 December 1664, and to John Dryden's and Sir Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span> which opened on 25 January 1664. On 7 November 1673 a Major Mullinax was buried in the Dark Cloister of Westminster Abbey, and it is likely that this was Cosmo Manuche, for on 11 January 1676 Mrs Frances Manuche was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey as well  (Chester, <span class="italic">Westminster Abbey Registers</span>).<br>
