<span class="headword">Overton,  John</span>  (1763&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and evangelical apologist</span>, was born at Monk Fryston in Yorkshire, where his father, George Overton, was a small landed proprietor. He belonged to an ancient Yorkshire family which early in the fourteenth century settled at Easington Hall in Holderness, and which included Major-General Robert Overton, though the estates were sold to the Milner family at the end of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Overton was educated at the village school at Monk Fryston, and in 1786 matriculated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1790 and MA in 1803. Overton was well thought of at Magdalene, which was just beginning to become established as an evangelical stronghold, and worked hard for exams, although he fell ill just before finals and took a pass degree. After ordination he became assistant curate to William Richardson, vicar of St Michael-le-Belfry in York and one of the leaders of the evangelical party in the north of England. He remained with Richardson until 1802, when he was appointed, through the influence of William Wilberforce, to the chancellor's livings of St Crux and St Margaret's in York. Like most early evangelicals he was a strong tory in politics and a great admirer of Pitt, and he took an active part in promoting the election of Wilberforce for the county of York.<br>
<br>In 1792 Overton married Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stodart (<i>d</i>. 1827), of Reeth in the Yorkshire dales, whose father was agent to the lairds of Arkendale. They had four daughters and eight sons, four of whom&#151;John, William, Thomas, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20969/', "Charles Overton")</script>&#151;became clergymen, two others becoming lawyers, and two doctors.<br>
<br>It was Overton's <span class="italic">The true churchmen ascertained, or, An apology for those of the regular clergy of the establishment who are sometimes called evangelical ministers</span> (1801) which brought him to public notice. In this work he tried to prove from an examination of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> that the evangelicals were the true churchmen and their opponents the real dissenters from the Church of England. This provoked a vigorous response from several churchmen, particularly Charles Daubeny&#151;one of those criticized by Overton&#151;in his <span class="italic">Vindiciae ecclesiae Anglicanae</span> (1803). Even the recently established evangelical periodical, the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, had reservations about Overton's book, to which he replied in <span class="italic">Four Letters to the Editor of the Christian Observer</span> (1805). However, prominent evangelicals such as Charles Simeon welcomed <span class="italic">The True Churchmen Ascertained</span> as an able and manly defence of their position. Overton also published a few other works, mostly sermons, but none of these sparked controversy. He died at York on 17 July 1838, and was buried in a vault alongside his wife in the chancel of St Crux.<br>
