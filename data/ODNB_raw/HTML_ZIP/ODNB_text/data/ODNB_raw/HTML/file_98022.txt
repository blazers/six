<span class="headword">Harrison,  Edward Frank</span>  (1869&#150;1918), <span class="occ">analytical chemist and army officer</span>, was born at 264 Albany Road, Camberwell, London, on 18 July 1869, the third child of William Harrison (1822/3&#150;1878), a Home Office clerk, and his wife, Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lawson. His father died when he was nine and his mother opened a small school, which enabled her sons to be educated at the United Westminster Schools. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a pharmaceutical chemist in north London, after which he was an assistant pharmacist in Croydon. In 1890 he gained a Pharmaceutical Society Bell scholarship and entered the School of Pharmacy in 1891. He spent long hours in the research laboratories of the Pharmaceutical Society and made ends meet by working at a pharmacy each evening and as an assistant lecturer at the school. His parents were Particular Baptists but his scientific education and a rigorous critical outlook caused him to replace religious conviction with a belief in research for its own sake. Hard work, seriousness, and a strong moral purpose were evident from an early age.<br>
<br>In 1894 Harrison was made a fellow of the Royal Chemical Society. With the aim of earning enough to marry he took a position with Brady and Martin, pharmaceutical chemists, of Newcastle upon Tyne. On 4 November 1895 he married Edith Helen (1872&#150;1937), a schoolteacher, the daughter of John James Wilson, timber merchant. They had two sons. About 1899 he was appointed head of the analytical department of Burroughs, Wellcome &amp; Co. at Dartford. During this time he prepared for his BSc examination at the University of London. Graduating in 1905, he formed a partnership with Charles Edward Sage as an analytical and consulting chemist, and also taught at Sage's Central School of Pharmacy. The partnership was dissolved in 1906 and Harrison took up independent practice in Chancery Lane, London. He was assisted by Percy Arthur William Self and by 1914 traded as Harrison and Self. His reputation for careful and thorough research led the British Medical Association to commission him to analyse a variety of proprietary medicines to prevent deception of the public. The results were published in 1909 as <span class="italic">Secret Remedies: what they Cost and what they Contain</span>, followed in 1912 by <span class="italic">More Secret Remedies</span>. That year, as chief witness for the British Medical Association, he gave effective evidence to the select committee of the House of Commons on patent medicines.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War Harrison made repeated attempts to enlist in the forces. He succeeded in May 1915 in joining the 23rd (1st Sportsman's) battalion, Royal Fusiliers, as a private, reducing his stated age by two years to meet the limit of forty-five. In April 1915 the Germans carried out an attack in Belgium using chlorine gas. This led to the formation of a chemists' corps of the Royal Engineers, in which he was commissioned temporary second lieutenant, in July 1915, to work on anti-gas research. Like most of his profession he regarded the German use of poison gas as a perversion of chemical science; he also had no doubt that the allies should reply in kind.<br>
<br>Harrison joined the staff of the anti-gas department, initially at the Royal Army Medical College at Millbank, London, which had the task of devising protection for British forces. The situation was one of the utmost urgency, as the allies had no form of respirator. The design and production of masks to protect against chlorine was comparatively simple but by July 1915 the problem was to devise a single mask which could keep out potentially over seventy gases. Hydrogen cyanide and phosgene emerged as the most likely to be used. Harrison's experience and intuition enabled him to make rapid decisions when scientists with a purely academic background tended to be overly cautious and deliberate in their investigations. There was a high degree of self-experimentation and scientists working on the project during this most critical phase were at times incapacitated, often to the point of unconsciousness.<br>
<br>The War Office wanted improved protection to be achieved through modification of the existing chemically impregnated flannelette hood. Although these hoods had some success against phosgene they were penetrated by high concentrations and were not suitable for adaptation to meet new threats. Almost immediately, in July 1915, Harrison and a small team began developing a respirator in which the protective chemicals were layered in a filter box, initially an adapted army water bottle. Soda lime permanganate granules, developed by Bertram Lambert at Oxford University, were capable of providing protection against a very wide range of substances but broke down into a dust that choked the wearer. Hardening the granules rendered them ineffective until, after forty-nine attempts, Harrison discovered a successful formula. Initially known as Harrison's tower, the respirator developed by the end of 1915 comprised a filter box connected to a facepiece with inlet and exhalation valves. Adopted by the army as the large box respirator, 200,000 were issued to artillerymen and machine-gunners between February and June 1916. A compact version, the small box respirator, was made a universal issue from August 1916. The design meant that the filter box could be modified to protect against new agents; regarded as the most effective gas mask of the war it was adopted by American forces in a modified form.<br>
<br>Harrison emerged as the most able researcher in solving the complex problems of both design and production and made frequent visits to France to meet chemists working at the front. In January 1917 he became head of the anti-gas department and in June was appointed CMG. On 1 November 1917 the anti-gas department became part of the chemical warfare department of the Ministry of Munitions and Harrison was appointed an assistant controller of the department, responsible for anti-gas apparatus. In July 1918 he was appointed deputy controller and in October controller, and in the same month he was appointed officer of the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>By October 1918 Harrison was weakened by two and a half years of constant work and the gas inhaled during the early stages. He succumbed to influenza and, after suffering from pneumonia, died at the premises of Harrison and Self at 57 Chancery Lane, London, on 4 November 1918. His wife and younger son survived him (his eldest son had been killed in action, aged nineteen, on 30 July 1916 during the battle of the Somme). Buried with full military honours at Brompton cemetery on 8 November, Harrison was the subject of lengthy tributes emphasizing his abilities, personality, and organizational genius, which led to the saving of many lives. Memorials to him were unveiled by the Pharmaceutical Society in Bloomsbury Square, and the Chemical Society at Burlington House, and both organizations continue to award prize medals in his memory.<br>
