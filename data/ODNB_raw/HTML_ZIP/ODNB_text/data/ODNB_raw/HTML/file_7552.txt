<span class="headword">Despenser, Sir  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1223&#150;1265), <span class="occ">justiciar</span>, was a middle-ranking baron who became a leading supporter of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, and the last holder of the office of justiciar of England re-established after the baronial seizure of power in 1258. He inherited his estates, which were mainly in Leicestershire, from his father, Hugh Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1238), who was a hereditary officer of Earl Ranulf of Chester, and high in the favour of Henry III. In recognition of his father's faithful service, the king in February 1238 permitted Despenser to marry as his friends thought best for his advancement. His wardship was bestowed on his uncle Geoffrey Despenser, he was given respite of knighthood in July 1244, and in the following January he received two casks of wine for the feast to celebrate his knighthood. Other marks of royal goodwill included gifts of timber in 1247 and 1249, and of free warren on an estate in Rutland in 1253.<br>
<br>From the late 1250s Despenser began to figure increasingly prominently in public affairs. In 1255 he was appointed constable of the royal castle at Horston, Derbyshire, for five years, and between April and September 1257 he was a member of the retinue of the king's brother Richard of Cornwall on his visit to Aachen for his coronation as king of the Romans. Next year he was included in the baronial twelve appointed to help draw up the provisions of Oxford, and under its terms he became a member of the committee of twelve chosen to represent the baronage at parliaments, and was reappointed constable of Horston Castle. He had been a friend of Simon de Montfort since at least 1256 when the two men undertook with others to arrange the politically sensitive marriage of Henry, son and heir of Edmund de Lacy, and on 1 January 1259 Montfort named him as an associate executor of his will, but this is not necessarily evidence of firm political loyalties. By early 1260 Despenser was married to Alina, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1643/', "Philip Basset")</script>, an influential magnate also involved in the Lacy covenant and a member of the parliamentary committee of twelve, who increasingly sided with the king. Moreover in August 1260 Despenser was one of the nobles summoned to London even though known supporters of Montfort were omitted, and the following month he was a member of the Lord Edward's household. His son and heir <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7553/', "Hugh Despenser")</script>, the ill-starred favourite of Edward II, was born on 1 March 1261.<br>
<br>For unexplained reasons Despenser never took up his duties as justice on the special eyre in Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire in November 1259. Nevertheless about 20 October 1260 a committee of five chosen by the royal council rejected the king's own nominee and chose instead Despenser to replace Hugh Bigod, the brother of the earl of Norfolk, as justiciar and keeper of the Tower of London, with an annual salary of 1000 marks. He thus became the chief administrative and judicial officer of the king, one of the appointments that caused Henry III to complain that the new baronial officials &#145;were wholly ignorant of their offices&#146;  (Treharne and Sanders no. 30, 215). Regardless of this Despenser discharged the omnicompetent duties of his predecessor and was particularly active trying cases on the special eyre in Sussex in the winter of 1260&#150;61. Together with Philip Basset, his father-in-law, he was also retained as a member of the king's household in December 1260. About 12 June 1261 however, after Henry III had regained his authority, he was dismissed as justiciar and keeper of the Tower, despite his protests that he could not be removed against the wishes of the barons, and replaced by Basset. He was not among the king's tenants-in-chief summoned to London in October 1261, and in June 1262 he was deprived of Horston Castle. By then Despenser's family was irreconcilably divided. Basset sided with the king, but Despenser himself, his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38272/', "John fitz John")</script> (who was also the nephew of Hugh Bigod), his cousin John Despenser (son of his former guardian), and John's half-brother, Roger de St John (who was probably married to Hugh Despenser's sister), supported Simon de Montfort.<br>
<br>When Montfort regained the ascendancy, Despenser was reappointed justiciar and keeper of the Tower, between 15 and 18 July 1263, on the usual salary, and later that year, between 23 September and 7 October, acted as regent during the king's visit to France. By the end of October, however, as disorder spread, he ceased to function as justiciar, although he seems to have kept control of the Tower. On 13 December 1263 he was one of the king's opponents who agreed to submit the baronial cause to the arbitration of Louis IX, but he rejected the king's abrogation of the provisions of Oxford. In March 1264, as keeper of the Tower, he led an angry crowd of Londoners who sacked Richard of Cornwall's manor of Isleworth, Middlesex, but in April he gave refuge in the Tower to the City's Jewish community which was being despoiled by, among others, John fitz John. At the battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264 Despenser fought in the front rank of the victorious rebel army, and forced his wounded father-in-law to surrender. No doubt it was at the request of his solicitous sons-in-law that Basset received a royal grant of venison and conies three weeks later. Despenser was also probably behind moves to secure the release of his cousin John, who had been captured fighting the king at Northampton.<br>
<br>With Montfort's triumph Despenser became a leading figure in the new government. He resumed his duties as justiciar on the customary salary, and was promised a staff of a hundred knights or serjeants to distrain offenders against the church. Although not formally a member of the new ruling Council of Nine, which included Roger de St John, he participated in its discussions, attended parliaments, authorized writs, and witnessed numerous royal charters. He was present at Westminster on 3 November 1264, when Henry, prior of St Radegund, took up his duties as treasurer, and on 25 February 1265, when Thomas de Cantilupe was appointed chancellor, the king himself folding the writ. He was also in attendance at Hereford on 7 May 1265 when special arrangements were approved for Cantilupe's absence from court.<br>
<br>Despenser was given a key role in co-ordinating the defences of the country to meet the threat of invasion by the king's supporters who had fled abroad. He assembled troops at London and ships at Sandwich, had custody at different times of the castles of Devizes, Oxford (later committed to Roger de St John), Orford, and Nottingham, and was given special responsibility for the defence of the coastline of East Anglia. As the threat of invasion passed he became increasingly active in the desperate search for a settlement with the king. On 11 and 15 September 1264 his name was included in panels to amend the new form of government, and on 24 September he went to France as a baronial envoy to inform the papal legate Guy Foulquois, cardinal-bishop of Sabina, that the barons were prepared to modify the <span class="roman">Provisons of Oxford</span> if the king would promise to expel aliens and rule through natives. Despenser was among those who were excommunicated on 20 October when they refused to submit.<br>
<br>Despenser profited considerably from his alliance with Montfort, despite the view of some that he was never fully rewarded for his support. In September 1264, eight years after the Lacy agreement, he was allowed to purchase the wardship on preferential terms. Robert de Pierpoint, who had been captured at Lewes, was kept in Despenser's prison until he undertook to pay a ransom of 700 marks, and Marmaduke Thweng, another of his prisoners, also had to be ransomed. Despenser, for his part, could be relied on to use his authority in favour of the Montfort family. On 30 June 1264 he headed a court that awarded vindictive damages of 10,000 marks, to be paid within ten days, against William (VI) de Briouze for allegedly ravaging one of the younger Simon de Montfort's manors, and on 18 November he was an obvious choice for the committee to adjudicate on the difficult problem of Eleanor de Montfort's dower.<br>
<br>Leaving his wife in the Tower, Despenser accompanied Montfort on his last campaign in the marches in the summer of 1265, and with John fitz John and others tried unsuccessfully to resolve the dispute between the earl and his fellow triumvir Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester. The collapse of Montfort's power brought disaster for Despenser and most of his relatives. John Despenser was captured at Kenilworth, and in the battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265 Roger de St John was slain, and Despenser himself, having refused to flee, was killed, reportedly by the thrust of a dagger. With the king's permission, his body was buried, with that of Montfort, at the foot of the steps before the high altar of the abbey church, where his remains were reported to have performed miracles, curing blind and disabled people. His widow surrendered the Tower before seeking the protection of her father, who was given Despenser's lands for his services to the king. Alina married as her second husband, by October 1271, Roger (III) Bigod, earl of Norfolk, the brother of the man Despenser had replaced as justiciar in 1260. She died in 1281.<br>
