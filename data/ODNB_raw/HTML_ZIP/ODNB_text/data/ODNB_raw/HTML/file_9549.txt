<span class="headword">Clinton,  Elizabeth  Fiennes de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald]</span>, countess of Lincoln <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Elizabeth  Fiennes Browne, Lady Browne; <em>called </em>Fair Geraldine]</span>  (1528?&#150;1589), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Grey. Her mother, the daughter of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset, and granddaughter of Edward IV's queen, Elizabeth Woodville, was Henry VIII's first cousin. Lady Elizabeth's early childhood was spent in her father's great household at Maynooth, which was wealthy, cultivated, and devout, the seat of Kildare ascendancy in Ireland. In October 1533 Lady Kildare returned to England, followed by her husband in February 1534, in response to a royal summons. In their absence, official threats to Kildare supremacy precipitated the rebellion of Lord Offaly (&#145;Silken Thomas&#146;), Lady Elizabeth's half-brother, and culminated in the destruction of the house of Kildare. The title was forfeited, the estates confiscated, and the family proscribed. The countess withdrew with her children&#151;except Gerald, who was in exile&#151;to Beaumanor, Leicestershire, the estate of her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11551/', "Lord Leonard Grey")</script>, who was himself executed in 1541. In the late 1530s Lady Elizabeth joined the household of her royal cousins, the princesses Mary and Elizabeth, and by June 1539 had entered the service of Princess Elizabeth.<br>
<br>At visits of the princesses' household to Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, and Hampton Court, Henry Howard, the poet earl of Surrey, first saw Lady Elizabeth. He wrote a sonnet, &#145;From Tuscan cam my ladies worthi race&#146;, to &#145;Geraldine&#146;, praising her descent, her education with a &#145;kinges child&#146;, and her beauty of form and spirit:<blockquote>
<div>Bewty of kind, her vertues from above;<br>
</div>
<div>Happy ys he that may obtaine her love.<br>
</div> (Howard, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 9)</blockquote>Surrey's father, the third duke of Norfolk, had offered support at court to the earl of Kildare in the early 1530s, and now Surrey offered chivalrous protection to the earl's daughter in the shipwreck of her family. Another sonnet, &#145;The golden gift that nature did thee geve&#146;, was, in the second edition of Richard Tottell's <span class="italic">Songes and Sonnettes</span> (1557, known as <span class="roman">Tottell's Miscellany</span>), addressed to &#145;Garret&#146;. There Surrey, or his poetic persona, wrote as &#145;thy frende &hellip; who seekes alway thine honour to preserve&#146;, and offered a cautionary warning: since her gifts were divinely given<blockquote>
<div>Do not deface them than wyth fansies newe,<br>
</div>
<div>Nor chaunge of mindes let not thy minde infect.<br>
</div> (ibid., 8)</blockquote>On 12 December 1542 Lady Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3665/', "Sir Anthony Browne (c.1500&#150;1548)")</script>, master of the horse, one of the grandest and wealthiest of Henry VIII's courtiers. She used the influence that this marriage gave her to restore the fortunes of her family; writing in July 1547 for a command in Scotland for her brother Edward, and arranging the marriage of her stepdaughter Mabel to her brother Gerald. Gerald Fitzgerald returned to England, was received into favour by Edward VI, and was knighted and restored to his Irish estates in April 1552. Sir Anthony Browne died in 1548. Lady Elizabeth bore him two sons, Edward and Thomas, who both died in infancy, and never bore another child.<br>
<br>In 1552 Lady Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5679/', "Edward Fiennes de Clinton, ninth Baron Clinton and Saye (1512&#150;1585)")</script>, lord high admiral. He was created earl of Lincoln in 1572. In 1569 Gerald, eleventh earl of Kildare, his brother, Edward, and three sisters, Margaret, Elizabeth, and Cecily, petitioned the queen, successfully, to be restored to their blood and lineage. Suits to the countess of Lincoln show that she was believed to have influence with Queen Elizabeth. In his will of July 1584 Clinton made his wife executor, but also attempted to guard her from attempts by his son Lord Henry Clinton to dispute the will. Three days before his father's death on 16 January 1585 Henry Clinton wrote to Lord Burghley complaining of the machinations of the countess to deprive him of his inheritance, and of her maligning him to the queen. Elizabeth, countess of Lincoln, died in March 1589 and was buried beside her second husband in St George's Chapel, Windsor, where she had already erected an elaborate monument to his memory.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Fiennes de Clinton had been a figure of some political influence, with a compelling pride in her Fitzgerald blood, but her posthumous reputation was as the Fair Geraldine, the object of the earl of Surrey's Petrarchan adoration. In Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">The Unfortunate Traveller</span> (1594) Surrey is seen writing her love poetry in the tradition of courtly love and, travelling in Italy, challenging all comers in defence of the beauty of his Fair Geraldine. Both the journey and the challenge were fictive. Michael Drayton used Nashe's fiction in <span class="italic">Englands Heroicall Epistles, Henry Howard Earle of Surrey to Geraldine</span> (1597), and told of Surrey's love for Geraldine. Sir Walter Scott followed Nashe's tale of Surrey's consultation of Cornelius Agrippa in Venice and his sight of Geraldine in a magic mirror in his &#145;Lay of the Last Minstrel&#146; (canto 6, stanzas 16&#150;20).<br>
