<span class="headword">Donnet, Sir  James John Louis</span>  (1816&#150;1905), <span class="occ">inspector-general of hospitals and fleets</span>, born at Gibraltar, was the son of Henry Donnet, a Royal Navy surgeon. After studying at the University of Paris, where he graduated B &egrave;s L, and at Anderson College, Glasgow, he became LSA of London in 1838, LRCS of Edinburgh in 1840, and MD at St Andrews in 1857. He entered the navy as assistant surgeon in the <i>Benbow</i> in 1840. He was at once appointed to the <i>Vesuvius</i> and sent to the Mediterranean, where, on the coast of Syria, he had his first experience of war; and after the capture of Acre he was placed in charge of the wounded in a temporary hospital established on shore. In 1844 he was medical officer and secretary of an embassy to the emperor of Morocco under Sir John Drummond-Hay, who was appointed consul-general in 1845.<br>
<br>Donnet was promoted surgeon, and in 1849 was in the <i>Calypso</i> in the West Indies during a virulent outbreak of yellow fever. Clements Markham, who met him at this time, described him as &#145;handsome, with a slender aquiline nose and clear cut features, being slightly built. &hellip; His manner was gentle and quiet, he was well-read with considerable conversational powers and the best of mess-mates&#146;  (Markham, &#145;Story of my service&#146;). In 1850&#150;51 he was surgeon of the <i>Assistance</i> in the Arctic with Captain Sir Erasmus Ommanney, and helped to break the tedium of the long winter by editing &#145;an excellent periodical, entitled the <span class="italic">Aurora Borealis</span>, to which the men as well as the officers contributed&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 113). He married in 1852 Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of James Meyer; they had no children. In 1854 he was surgeon of the <i>President</i>, flagship in the Pacific, and in her was present at the disastrous attacks on Petropavlovsky in Kamchatka, Siberia, on 29 August and 7 September  (Clowes, 6.429&#150;32).<br>
<br>As staff surgeon at the Port Royal Hospital in Jamaica in 1866&#150;7 Donnet prepared a detailed study of yellow fever at a time when an epidemic of the disease was raging. The study was published in the <span class="italic">Health Report</span> of 1867. Donnet thus laid the foundation of modern medical practice in dealing with this disease. Later he published <span class="italic">Notes on Yellow Fever</span>. In May 1867 he was promoted deputy inspector-general.<br>
<br>In 1870 he was appointed honorary surgeon to the queen, and in 1873&#150;4 he was placed in charge of the medical wards of Haslar naval hospital, Gosport, which was crowded with cases of smallpox, enteric fever, and dysentery after the Anglo-Asante War. On 14 April 1875 he was promoted inspector-general. After this he was employed on various committees and commissions, including one in 1876 to select a site for a college for naval cadets and one in 1877 to inquire into the causes of the outbreak of scurvy in Sir George Nares's Arctic expedition (1875&#150;6). He was awarded a good-service pension in 1878, and was made KCB at Queen Victoria's 1897 jubilee. During his last years he resided at Bognor, and he died at his home, 3 Sidlaw Terrace, Clarence Road, Bognor, on 11 January 1905.<br>
