<span class="headword">Tappenden,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1742, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">lawyer, banker, and ironmaster</span>, was baptized on 13 October 1742 at St Mary's Church, Faversham, Kent, the only surviving child of James Tappenden (1707&#150;1745), hoyman and mayor of Faversham (1743), and his wife, Mary Jones, daughter of Captain Isaac Jones, of the same town. Educated at King's School, Canterbury (1752&#150;4), he was articled to Faversham attorney Thomas Buck in 1757, and took over his practice when Buck died in 1779. In 1765 he married Mary Frances Beckwith (1745&#150;1771), with whom he had three children, one of whom died in infancy. In 1780 he married his cousin Margaret Tappenden, with whom he had four sons and four daughters, one of whom married George Giles Vincent, son of the dean of Westminster. Tappenden had four separate but overlapping careers, in local government, law, banking, and industry. He was an excellent example of a general type of eighteenth-century men of affairs.<br>
<br>In local government Tappenden took all the important posts: he was appointed town clerk of Faversham and clerk to the wardmote (borough) court in 1779; he was clerk to the justices of the upper division of the lathe of Scray, giving him influence beyond the ancient borough. His regional influence was reinforced by his stewardship of the manor and hundred of Faversham and of the manors of Leysdown and Chilham and, by 1812, his chairmanship of the key audit committee of the Cinque Ports. He was, not surprisingly, also clerk to the vestry.<br>
<br>Tappenden was Faversham's leading attorney. In 1814 a judge in Doctors' Commons thought Tappenden &#145;a considerable guarantee of the fairness of the transaction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 May 1814). The town's nineteenth-century historian E. Crow noted that &#145;few men stood higher in legal knowledge, or was consulted upon more various subjects&#146;  (Crow). He was also a scrivener&#151;a specialist in property conveyancing and mortgages&#151;a skill he put to his own advantage as he acquired considerable property in east Kent with his increasing wealth.<br>
<br>In 1789 Tappenden brought together his close knowledge of other people's affairs, and built on the confidence people had in him, by establishing the Faversham Bank. His choice of partner, William Bennett, a well-known local merchant, was wise, as it brought a valuable London trade dimension to the town's first bank. It survived twenty-five turbulent years, supported by its London agent, Williams &amp; Co., and was held in high esteem by individuals and institutions in the area.<br>
<br>In 1801 Tappenden and his relatives invested &pound;40,000 in a co-partnership in a new ironworks in Aber-nant, in Glamorgan, which was to lead to his financial collapse and disgrace. In 1807, when the investment had risen to &pound;70,000 for no financial return, his Welsh partners (Jeremiah Homfray and James Birch) withdrew. Tappenden's ambitious attempt to build an integrated and competitive business included the construction of three furnaces, 8 miles of tramroad from Aber-nant to the head of the Neath Canal, and a 100-ton-per-week rolling mill at Pontypridd, the latter undoubtedly a stimulus to the development of that place. Tappenden's son called the Welsh enterprise a &#145;gigantic concern&#146;  (Centre for Kentish Studies, U1823/17 C1 T16&#150;21). But just as the company's operating costs increased, aggravated by the loss of a protracted lawsuit against the Neath Canal Company, so the price of pig and bar iron weakened. This put intolerable strain on a business by then too reliant on credit.<br>
<br>Williams &amp; Co. petitioned for the bankruptcy of the Abernant Iron Company in December 1814, at the same time stopping the Faversham Bank. Creditors of the Welsh business claimed debts of &pound;270,000. These claims were in addition to the claims on the Faversham Bank, and to the &pound;130,000 invested by Tappenden, suggesting that total claims were upwards of &pound;500,000. Thus Tappenden ranked among the largest business failures of the period; embarrassing questions as to where such large sums had gone went unanswered.<br>
<br>The people of Faversham were shocked by the downfall of their leading citizen and, in an immediate gesture of support, elected his son Charles to all his public offices; here, too, their trust was misplaced, for Charles was imprisoned for felony in 1818. Tappenden died, insolvent, at Milbank Street, Westminster, on 5 April 1841.<br>
