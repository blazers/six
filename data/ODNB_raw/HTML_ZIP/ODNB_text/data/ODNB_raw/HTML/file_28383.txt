<span class="headword">Wade,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1825), <span class="occ">surgeon, physician, and botanist</span>, was the son of John Wade (<i>d</i>. 1799), a Dublin apothecary (a descendant of Henry Wade of Clonebraney, co. Meath, Ireland) and his wife, Katherine. He was probably educated in Dublin, and was then apprenticed to a surgeon. By 1776 he was in practice as a surgeon and man-midwife in Bolton Street, Dublin, and from 1781 in Capel Street where his father had his pharmacy. On 25 July 1777 ten of Dublin's most eminent physicians, including Dr Edward Hill and Sir Nathaniel Barry, signed a testimonial  (MSS, University of St Andrews muniments) recommending that he merited a &#145;Diploma to Practice physick&#146; because they either had &#145;certain proofs of [his] capacity, skill and attention in his attendance on many persons committed to his care in the medical line&#146; or had &#145;reason to believe him a person of medical experience&#146;. On 27 June 1786 the senate of the University of St Andrews agreed to confer on him the degree of doctor of medicine on the basis of this nine-year-old testimonial. On 30 October that year, and on the following 23 April, he was examined by the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, after which he was admitted a licentiate.<br>
<br>From the late 1780s Wade became prominent as a botanist, not a difficult achievement as there were few botanists active in Ireland at the time. He was an active member of the Experimental Society of Dublin for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge. In 1787 he tried unsuccessfully to publish by subscription <span class="italic">Flora Dubliniensis</span>, a handsome, illustrated work modelled on William Curtis's <span class="italic">Flora Londinensis</span> (1775?&#150;1798). During 1789 he advertised public lectures in his Capel Street house on midwifery and on botany.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1790 a petition from Wade was presented to the Irish House of Commons by the solicitor-general, John Toler, &#145;that the Establishment of a Publick Botanical Garden in this City, or its Environs, on an enlarged plan, would be of the greatest National Advantage&#146;  (Wade). With the powerful support of the speaker, John Foster, Wade's scheme succeeded when, after much delay, on 25 March 1795 the Dublin Society's Botanic Gardens were founded at Glasnevin. Wade had assiduously cultivated the Dublin Society, ingratiating himself by presenting various botanical manuscripts, and was elected an honorary member in 1792. He was invited to undertake the layout of the new garden, and in 1796 was elected the society's professor of botany. He remained in control of the gardens until his death.<br>
<br>Wade held other positions simultaneously, including physician to the Dublin General Dispensary and lecturer in botany at the Royal College of Surgeons. He failed on two occasions (1800, 1809) to obtain the chair of botany in the University of Dublin. He was ambitious, and careful to maintain the patronage he enjoyed from John Foster (1740&#150;1828), who was a skilful politician and a passionate gardener. The first of Wade's publications, <span class="italic">Catalogus systematicus plantarum indigenarum in comitatu Dublinensi</span> (1794), was dedicated to Foster, who was to eulogize his prot&eacute;g&eacute; as &#145;a man of great worth, zeal and knowledge &hellip; no man could excel him in his perfect knowledge [of botany]&#146;  (Foster to Dublin Society, 7 Nov 1825, Belfast RO, Foster/Massereine MSS). On the other hand, Erinensis (Dr Peter Hennis Green) jibed that Professor Wade was &#145;an old-fashioned <i>prig</i> &hellip; an old coxcomb&#146;  (Erinensis, 255). Wade was elected an associate of the Linnean Society of London (1792), a member of the Royal Irish Academy (1811), a fellow of the Royal Society of London (1811), and an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (1811). He was deputy grand master of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Ireland (1794&#150;9).<br>
<br>Wade visited various parts of Ireland in search of plants: in 1796 and 1805 he was in co. Kerry, and during 1801 in Connemara where he discovered pipewort (<i>Eriocaulon aquaticum</i>). His published works include the earliest catalogues of the plants cultivated in the botanic gardens, two sets of lecture notes on grasses (1808), an English edition of Fran&ccedil;ois Michaux's treatise on oaks (1809), and a monograph on willows (1811).<br>
<br>Wade married Mary Chambers (1733/4&#150;1831), a Quaker, in 1781; she was disowned by the Society of Friends for marrying a man &#145;not of our Society&#146;  (Nelson and McCracken, 23). The couple had no children. He died at Dublin on 25 July 1825, at which time he was described by a contemporary as an octogenarian.<br>
