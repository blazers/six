<span class="headword">Birdsall,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>John Augustine]</span>  (1775&#150;1837), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born on X27 June 1775 at Liverpool, the son of Cottam Birdsall (1743&#150;1829), a grocer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1744&#150;1818). His childhood was spent in Liverpool but his parents eventually settled in Richmond, Yorkshire, where they stayed for the rest of their lives. Birdsall was educated at the English Dominican school at Bornhem, in Flanders, which was closed by the incursion of the French Revolution in 1794. In 1795 he entered the novitiate of the English Benedictine abbey of Lamspringe in the bishopric of Hildesheim. He made his solemn profession there on 6 November 1796 and was ordained priest on 30 May 1801. In September 1802 he became prefect (as the headmaster was known) of the small school at Lamspringe, where his pupils included Peter Augustine Baines (1787&#150;1843), who was later to play a crucial part in his life. He returned to England after the seizure of Hildesheim by Prussia and the suppression of his monastery on 3 January 1803. After some time at Ampleforth College, Yorkshire, where most of the Lamspringe students were relocated, he was appointed assistant priest to the Benedictine mission at Bath, where he resided from 1806 to 1809. Birdsall pursued two careers simultaneously: he was on the one hand an active missioner and builder of chapels, while on the other he acted as head of a religious congregation struggling for survival after the seemingly disastrous closure of its continental houses during the French Revolution.<br>
<br>Cheltenham, a town in which population increased from 3000 to 20,000 in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, was to be the centre of Birdsall's activities for most of his active life. An attempt to establish a Benedictine mission in 1805 under Dom James Calderbank (1770&#150;1821) had failed, and the Cheltenham Catholics had to rely on visits from the resident priest at Gloucester and, from 1807, on the ministrations of Abb&eacute; Nicolas Alexandre C&eacute;sar Robin (<i>d</i>. 1811), an exiled priest from the French diocese of Laon, who celebrated mass in hired rooms. Birdsall was appointed to the town in 1809 and through the use of his <i>peculium</i>, the personal pension allowed to monks on the mission, and donations from family and friends, was able to open a chapel in Somerset Place on 3 June 1810. With various later extensions it had a seating capacity of some 500. Attached to it was a clergy house and, from 1827, a charity school. Birdsall's early years at Cheltenham were marked by quick and solid progress but, after 1824 with the appointment of the evangelical Francis Close (1797&#150;1882) as curate (and from 1826 incumbent) of Cheltenham, he became increasingly involved in controversy with the established church. &#145;We Catholics are said to be idolaters of images,&#146; he once remarked characteristically, adding, as he pointed to the two carved angels that flanked the altar-steps of his chapel, &#145;Now I gave &pound;4.16s for those two statues, and if anybody will send me a five-pound note for the pair I'll let him have them with pleasure. <i>That's</i> how I worship them&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Lamspringe's buildings, which Birdsall revisited in 1828 and 1830, suffered very little as a result of its closure, but its community was dwindling and scattered. Birdsall sought to revive it at Broadway, Worcestershire, where he established a mass centre in 1826. A property was acquired in 1828, the foundation-stone for a monastic house laid in 1830, and the first mass in the newly completed chapel celebrated in 1831. In his last years he spent an increasing proportion of his time at Broadway in his &#145;German College&#146;, conducted, as <span class="italic">The Laity's Directory</span> (1836) put it, &#145;by the Gentlemen formerly of Lamspringe&#146;.<br>
<br>Cheltenham and Broadway formed the relatively stable base for Birdsall's national work. From 1814, when he was elected a definitor of the southern Benedictine province, until his death he was at the centre of the struggle for survival and identity within the English Benedictine congregation. In 1822 he was elected provincial of Canterbury by general chapter and was re-elected in 1826. In the same year he became president-general, which he was to remain until 1837. In 1829 he was pro-vicar apostolic of the western district for the ailing Bishop Peter Bernadine Collingridge (1757&#150;1829). He received the titular dignities of cathedral prior of Winchester in 1826 and abbot of Westminster in 1830.<br>
<br>The period of Birdsall's office was a difficult one. The Catholic community was coming to terms with the institutional and financial implications of emancipation. The Benedictines in their two principal centres at Ampleforth and Downside were fighting for survival, faced with dwindling numbers and the loss of many continental houses during the French Revolution. One of the most well-known Benedictines, Bishop Baines, vicar apostolic of the western district 1829&#150;43, wanted to use the manpower and finance of his monastic congregation to create what he thought would be an effective church structure adapted to the needs of the time. He aimed to depopulate his own monastery at Ampleforth, close Downside, and transfer the rich mission of Bath to his own jurisdiction. Prior Park in Bath was to be developed as the magnificent setting for his episcopate. Birdsall's severe, headstrong, and determined personality led him to resist Baines on all levels. Baines conceded that Birdsall's election as president-general was because of his ability &#145;to wage war with a bishop&#146;  (O'Donoghue, 19). Birdsall &#145;continued throughout life&#146;, as his unsympathetic biographer Dom Athanasius Allanson put it, &#145;to be much opposed to the arbitrary dealings of others&#146;  (Allanson, 2.248). His ultimately successful confrontation with Baines probably saved the English Benedictines from extinction. His influence on his fellow monks was not merely defensive.<br>
<br>Like Baines, Birdsall was a man of vision who gave great encouragement to those such as Dom Bede Polding (1794&#150;1877) who were establishing the Australian mission, the great enterprise of the nineteenth-century English Benedictines. Birdsall saw the Australian mission as part of the Catholic contribution to the British empire. &#145;For our Island&#146;, he wrote in 1820 to Nicholas Wiseman, then in Rome, &#145;is in constant intercourse with all the countries of the East by means of their commercial relations, and might be made a sort of Head Quarters from which the Church would be able to exercise its authority and disperse its blessings to all around us&#146;  (Birdsall to Wiseman, 15 Aug 1829, Wiseman MSS).<br>
<br>Birdsall's activities left him little time for writing, although he published <span class="italic">Christian Reflections for every Day in the Month</span> in 1822, a translation from an eighteenth-century French original. A portrait of him, showing a solid figure in middle age, is housed at Downside. Birdsall died at the college in Broadway on 2 August 1837. A memorial tablet at Cheltenham did not survive the rebuilding of his chapel, while the inscription on his tomb in the Catholic graveyard at Broadway, or Vialta (the Roman form he used in his diary), is now difficult to decipher.<br>
