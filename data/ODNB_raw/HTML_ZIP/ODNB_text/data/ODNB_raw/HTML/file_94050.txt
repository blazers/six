<span class="headword">Roberts,  Edward</span>  (1845&#150;1933), <span class="occ">tidal computer</span>, was born at the Broadway, Deptford, Kent, on 30 April 1845, the son of John Roberts, dealer in glass and earthenware, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spearing. He attended Greenwich proprietary school, where he was taught by Thomas Goodwin, and gained many prizes mainly in chemistry and mathematics. After leaving school in 1860 he obtained a place on the staff of the Royal Greenwich Observatory through an introduction from the astronomer Robert Main. In addition to the routine work of computing and observing, G. B. Airy, the astronomer royal, engaged him on additional projects. On 8 February 1864 he married Louisa Mary Ann (<i>b</i>. 1845), daughter of George John Webb, a cooper, of Bermondsey, with whom he had eleven children.<br>
<br>Roberts had been enabled to marry by his transfer in 1864, on Airy's recommendation, to the nautical almanac office of the Admiralty. He remained there until his retirement. On account of his numerical skill Roberts was commended to the pioneering work being undertaken by Sir William Thomson in the field of tidal prediction. In 1867 Thomson had advanced a theoretical solution to the problems of tidal prediction, but his harmonic method required an immense amount of calculation for the analysis and particularly for the prediction, a task of computation that Roberts undertook. The scale of these computations was an obstacle to the success of Thomson's solution and by 1872 he had concluded that a mechanical device (proposed earlier by a Cambridge mathematician, Francis Bashforth, in 1845) would resolve the problems, although none had yet been built. Roberts, after consultations with Thomson, who had procured funds from the British Association, produced in 1873 a two-component model with the instrument makers A. L&eacute;g&eacute; &amp; Co. This prototype summed two cosines. Months later, the British Association funded a ten-component machine to deal with the main computing part of Thomson's new method of tide prediction. Even this model was too small to deal with all the complex calculations, and most of the world's tides remained beyond reliable prediction. For its geodetic demands the Indian government then commissioned a twenty-component machine from Roberts and L&eacute;g&eacute;, which was built in 1878, and became the key to the success of Thomson's harmonic method. When Roberts described this new machine as his own design, Thomson took exception, and snubbed him publicly, both in person and in exchanges in <span class="italic">Nature</span> in March and April 1881.<br>
<br>With Roberts as its computist, the astronomer John Couch Adams and the mathematical physicist George Howard Darwin headed this British research programme from 1879. Although they resolved tides across the globe, their main output was <span class="italic">Tide Tables for the Indian Ports</span>, of which Roberts was co-author from first publication in 1880 until 1906. In 1905 Thomson procured the relocation of the Indian tides work to the recently founded National Physical Laboratory, but the superintendent of the nautical almanac office regarded Roberts as too valuable to allow him to leave at the ordinary superannuation age, and obtained permission to retain him in the department for a further two years. Roberts retired as chief assistant in 1907 and was appointed to the Imperial Service Order.<br>
<br>At his own expense Roberts commissioned L&eacute;g&eacute; in 1906 to build a new predictor that was twice the size of the Indian machine. More than 2 metres high and several tonnes in weight, the machine was built and used at the Lewisham home of his son, Herbert William Thomson Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1930), with whom he entered into the business of tidal prediction on a private basis. With this machine, which in 1908 won the Franco-British Exhibition grand prix, they computed tides commercially, continuing <span class="italic">Holden's Liverpool Almanac</span> and gaining new contracts at the expense of the National Physical Laboratory. On the outbreak of war in 1914 Roberts was brought back within the Admiralty hydrographic department to compute the tides of German naval ports, Ostend, and Panama. During this period, in collaboration with the younger workers Harold Warburg and Arthur Doodson, he helped in the final perfection of Thomson's harmonic method. In 1926, with Roberts in old age and the health of his son in decline, the tide predictor machine was sold to the Liverpool Tidal Institute, of which Doodson was associate director, and where the machine was later used for predicting the D-day tides.<br>
<br>Roberts served as secretary to the ships stability (Admiralty) commission 1871, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1872 and fellow of the Statistical Society in 1882. His meticulous numeracy was held in high regard. Airy had commended him to the nautical almanac office as &#145;the best for hunting out an error by irregular examination&#146;  (Royal Greenwich Observatory, 6/207/125). Thomson commented that &#145;He enters into the principle of the calculation in such a way as to give much more value to his work than if he were a mere calculator&#146;  (CUL, Add. 7656 K.169). Several admired the extraordinary neatness of his work and the beauty of his figures, both of which features he combined with extraordinary speed. He represented an important link in the development of modern tidal science: through Airy he knew the work of the first Admiralty tide tables of 1833; his twenty-component Indian machine (now in the Survey of India Museum at Dehra Dun) anticipated the advanced American machine of 1882, the highly independent Australian machine of 1897, and then crucially the copy made in Germany in 1915; while the machine made to his own final design (and now in the World Museum, Liverpool) influenced the best and last of the mechanical tide predictors built in the United States in 1911, Germany in 1938, and Britain in 1953. Together his machines constituted a pioneering family of functional analogue computers.<br>
<br>In his later years a justice of the peace, Roberts died at 20 St John's Park, Greenwich, on 4 August 1933. The nuclear physicist Tony Hilton Royle Skyrme was his grandson.<br>
