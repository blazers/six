<span class="headword">Tate,  James</span>  (1771&#150;1843), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born at Richmond in Yorkshire on 11 June 1771, the only surviving son of Thomas Tate, a working maltster originally from Berwick, and his wife, Dinah Cumstone, who came from a family of small farmers in Swaledale. In May 1779, after attending two private schools, James entered the grammar school at Richmond, where his ability was recognized by the master, the Revd Anthony Temple. On Temple's recommendation, Tate became in 1784 amanuensis to Francis Blackburne, rector of Richmond and latitudinarian controversialist. Enjoying access to Blackburne's library, Tate owed much to the stimulus of this early influence and, with Temple's help, he obtained a sizarship at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1790, graduating BA in 1794 as sixth senior optime and proceeding MA in 1797. He was from 1795 to 1796 a fellow of his college before, on 27 September 1796, he was appointed master of Richmond School, the fulfilment, it was said, of a childhood ambition. Two days later he married, at Kensington parish church in London, Margaret, second daughter of Feilding Wallis, the actor. He was ordained deacon in 1795 and priest in 1800, held the perpetual curacy of Bellerby, Yorkshire, from 1800 to 1808, and was in October 1808 appointed rector of Marske, near Richmond, a living which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Tate transformed Richmond School (of which he was master until January 1833), into one of the leading classical schools of his day, attracting boys from throughout the country. Between 1812 and 1833 six pupils a year on average proceeded to the universities. Their successes at Cambridge earned them the title of &#145;Tate's invincibles&#146;  (Wenham, 68); thirteen were elected to fellowships at Trinity College. At his instigation the school buildings were considerably enlarged in 1815. Rejecting corporal punishment and refusing to rule by fear, Tate succeeded instead in inspiring his pupils, as one of them recalled, &#145;with that passion for learning by which he was himself animated&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1843), encouraging the most promising boys during walks with them in the Yorkshire dales. Himself trained in mathematics, he applied the same precise methods to classical teaching, instilling habits of rigid accuracy. He was a widely respected classical scholar. Robert Surtees, the Durham antiquary, recalled that on the occasion of their first meeting they spent the night in quoting the <span class="italic">Iliad</span>  (G. Taylor, <span class="italic">Memoir of Surtees</span>, 1852, 128), and Sydney Smith, who by chance travelled in the same coach as the master of Richmond, declared to a friend that he had fallen in with &#145;a man dripping with Greek&#146;. Most of Tate's published works were schoolbooks: they included an edition of James Moor's <span class="italic">Elementa linguae Gracae</span> (1824) and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Principal Greek Tragic and Comic Metres</span> (1827; 4th edn, 1834). With George Dunbar, professor of Greek at Edinburgh University, he added to Andrew Dalzell's <span class="italic">Collectanea Gracea majora</span> (1805&#150;20). His most important work was <span class="italic">Horatius restitutus</span> (1832), an attempt to arrange the books of Horace in chronological order, applying the method of Richard Bentley. Reaching a third edition, it was favourably noticed by H. H. Milman in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>  (62, Oct 1838), and later by W. B. Donne in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>  (92, Oct 1850).<br>
<br>Like his father, Tate was a strong whig, advocating Catholic emancipation in an assize sermon delivered in 1825. During the long period of tory ascendancy, his politics debarred him from the preferment which he sought to relieve the burden of his large family (seven sons and four daughters); he was among the unsuccessful candidates at the time of Thomas Arnold's appointment as headmaster of Rugby School in 1827. His fortunes improved on the return of a whig administration. In January 1833 Lord Grey appointed him canon of St Paul's, and by virtue of his canonry he became incumbent of the parish church of Edmonton in Middlesex. Tate died at Clifton, Bristol, on 2 September 1843 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. When, in 1850, Richmond School moved to a new site, the building, paid for by 140 subscribers, was a Tate memorial. His eldest son, James Tate (1801&#150;1863) succeeded him as master of the school.<br>
