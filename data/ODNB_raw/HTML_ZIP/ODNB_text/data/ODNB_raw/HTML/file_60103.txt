<span class="headword">Coleman,  Donald Cuthbert</span>  (1920&#150;1995), <span class="occ">economic historian</span>, was born on 21 January 1920 at Martlesham, Long Lane, Finchley, Middlesex, the son of Hugh Augustus Coleman, civil servant, and his wife, Marian Stella Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cuthbert. Educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School, he left in 1939 to enter the London insurance industry. He served in the Royal Artillery from 1941 to 1946, seeing service in the Mediterranean and rising to the rank of major. He then entered the London School of Economics (LSE) and was awarded his PhD for a thesis on seventeenth-century Kent. This research served as a bridgehead for other studies and for his first book, <span class="italic">The British Paper Industry, 1495&#150;1860</span> (1958). It also set the pattern of work, using primary sources (helped here by excise and customs records) and following the evolution of an industry over the long run, marking transformations of materials, technology, and markets. His next book, <span class="italic">Sir John Banks, Baronet and Businessman: a Study of Business, Politics and Society in Later Stuart England</span> (1963), closed in to focus on the importance of kinship in business. The relations between industry and the state, and between merchants and government in policy matters, were always central to his interests.<br>
<br>Recognition of Coleman's scholarship led to his appointment in 1951 to a new lectureship in industrial history at LSE, and after spending the academic year 1957&#150;8 in the USA, at Yale, he rose to a readership in 1958. He married on 5 February 1954 Jessie Annie Matilda (Ann) Child, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevens, a divorcee ten years his senior. His appointment as historian of Courtaulds brought links with the Pasold fund for textile history and in 1969, with the publication of the first two volumes of <span class="italic">Courtaulds: an Economic and Social History</span>, came a personal chair at LSE. His academic standing was considerably enhanced by his joint editorship of the <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span> from 1967 to 1973. He was a notably firm, even authoritarian, editor, whose judgements markedly increased the status of the <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span> as it expanded from three to four issues annually.<br>
<br>The concept of proto-industrialization which gathered momentum during the 1970s was being proposed by some scholars as a universal stage in the historical process. This was not to Coleman's liking; he profoundly distrusted such all-embracing methodologies, whether from the left or the right of the political spectrum, and preferred &#145;middle-order&#146; theorizing from an empirical foundation. He challenged its claims on the grounds of chronology and universality in an article whose title, &#145;Proto-industrialisation: a concept too many&#146;, characteristically did not end in a question mark  (<span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>, 2nd ser., 36, 1983, 435&#150;48). He was concerned with the origins of the industrial revolution in England; in <span class="italic">The Economy of England, 1450&#150;1750</span> (1977) he examined the ways in which political, social, intellectual, agrarian, commercial, and industrial change in England had diverged from the situation in other European countries, so that industrialization began in England in the eighteenth century, rather than elsewhere. Many of his numerous papers examined aspects of this process in greater depth.<br>
<br>With his long view of industry Coleman also entered the debate over failings in the British economy after 1850. His principal contribution was &#145;Gentlemen and players&#146; (<span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>, 2nd ser., 26, 1973, 92&#150;116). The industrial revolution had been driven by &#145;those who were not gentlemen&#146; but subsequently business and industrial leaders succumbed to the values of the older &eacute;lite and &#145;too many of the revolutionaries became too busy becoming gentlemen&#146;. Thus a fatal link was forged between the &#145;educated amateur&#146; and the &#145;practical man&#146; which excluded professionalization for the &eacute;lite with dire consequences.<br>
<br>Coleman was intensely interested in the practical and financial world of his day and sympathetic in principle to those who made it work. He admired achievement and success attained through hard work, commitment, intelligence, and insight. That he was able to overcome the potential conflicts of interest between his role as adviser to firms about their history, and that of the independent and objective academic, and to win the respect, if not always the affection, of both parties, testifies to his strength of character.<br>
<br>The qualities Coleman admired in others were also his own; he disliked privilege and pomposity&#151;whether social, political, or academic&#151;and was liable to speak out against pretentiousness, with a lack of reticence that any friends had to accept. His own beliefs were sometimes less prominent than his castigations of false nostrums offered by others. He opposed any lowering of professional standards, and this opposition, coupled with a long memory, made his views forthright and often acerbic. Yet the standards he expected of others were also those he applied to himself, and he earned the unremitting affection and loyalty of his research students.<br>
<br>With work at LSE and life in London losing their attractions in difficult years, Coleman's move in 1971 to a chair in Cambridge and a professorial fellowship at Pembroke College brought him new personal and professional satisfaction. He was elected FBA in 1972. Life at Over Hall, Cavendish, Suffolk, in his spacious old vicarage and handsome garden, became increasingly congenial. He mellowed, became more relaxed with his visitors, devoted in caring for his wife as she became more frail, and generous even in his judgement of the failings of others.<br>
<br>With undergraduate teaching becoming more tedious and lecturing a painful duty which he saw no need to endure further, Coleman retired from the chair in 1981, keeping his fellowship. His great delight now was to work in his upstairs study at Cavendish, encompassed by his library. His academic priority was to write, while responding to invitations to help and advise. His own commitment to the Pasold fund continued until two years before his death: he was its governor from 1977 and chairman from 1985 to 1993. He died at the Evelyn Hospital, Cambridge, after a long and painful illness, the result of cancer, on 3 September 1995. His wife survived him, dying several years later.<br>
