<span class="headword">Lancaster,  John</span>  (1569/70&#150;1619), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Waterford and Lismore</span>, was a native of Prescot, Lancashire, and probably the third son of Thomas Lancaster of Rainhill, Lancashire. Educated at Eton College, he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, on 28 August 1587, aged seventeen, graduated BA in 1592, proceeded MA in 1597, and held a college fellowship during 1590&#150;97. A chaplain to James I, he arrived in Ireland in 1607 bearing a letter from the king directing that he be granted the first available bishopric. On 5 January 1608 he was nominated to Waterford and Lismore, a see long held <i>in commendam</i> by the pluralist Miler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel.<br>
<br>Lancaster was Waterford's first resident bishop for nearly thirty years. Churches and communities had been devastated in the uprisings of Elizabeth's reign, and much of the see land had been alienated by the four previous bishops, especially in the west, where the episcopal manors of Lismore and Ardmore were now held by Richard Boyle, earl of Cork. Lancaster's episcopate was marked by a determined effort to increase the revenues of his diocese, which he calculated at no more than &pound;40 for Waterford and &pound;60 for Lismore. In 1610 he was awarded a grant <i>in commendam</i> of various benefices in his own and adjacent dioceses, to which in 1614 was added the vicarage of Mothel, co. Waterford. He introduced a bill into the Irish House of Commons to have his predecessors' sales of diocesan property declared null and void, but, owing to the intervention of the earl of Cork, &#145;by a general clamour and consent [it] was cast out of the house&#146;  (Grosart, 2.101). In 1618 he succeeded in obtaining for his diocese a grant of 546 acres of escheated land in co. Wexford.<br>
<br>In Waterford the great majority of the citizens were Roman Catholic, and the city was imbued with the spirit of the Counter-Reformation. Lancaster built a new episcopal residence, provoking the hostility of the mayor by using timbers and other materials from St Peter's Church. His determination to assert his authority by refusing to allow the mayor to hold up his sword of office in the cathedral precincts resulted in an angry complaint to the government. In March 1618, successive mayors and sheriffs having refused to take the oath of supremacy, the corporation was abolished, the city being placed under direct rule from Dublin.<br>
<br>Lancaster appears to have been twice married. By his first marriage he had two sons. The elder, John, was precentor of both Lismore and Waterford. In 1616 Boyle granted him the vicarage of Mothel, &#145;and he promised me to assure his mother-in-law [i.e. stepmother] &pound;30 a year during her life&#146;, to commence after the bishop's death  (Grosart, 1.125). The younger John Lancaster married Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir Edward Harris, justice of the common pleas, and had a son, John, admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1638 aged fifteen. He died on 18 April 1630. There is a monument to his wife in Kinsalebeg churchyard near Youghal. The bishop's younger son, Joshua, of Grange, co. Tipperary, married Mary, daughter of Gilbert Waters of Cullen, co. Tipperary, and had a daughter, Elizabeth. He died in October 1634.<br>
<br>In 1619 Lancaster was at Ardfinnan attempting to wrest the episcopal manor from Miler Magrath's daughter when fire destroyed the hut containing his personal effects and records, including the 1487 rental of the diocese known as the black book. Magrath commented acidly that its destruction was a greater loss to the church than if all the protestant bishops of Munster had been drowned. Shortly after this (at some time between April and July 1619) Lancaster died; he was buried in Waterford Cathedral.<br>
