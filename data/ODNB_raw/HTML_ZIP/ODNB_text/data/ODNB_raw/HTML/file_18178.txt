<span class="headword">Martin,  Elias</span>  (1739&#150;1818), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and baptized there at St Gertrud Church on 8 March 1739, which was probably also the date of his birth. His parents were master joiner Olof Martin and Ulrica Haupt. He was the eldest of four brothers, one of whom was the engraver <a href="#cosubject_18196">Johan Fredric Martin [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Elias Martin was educated in his father's joinery workshop and after that by Friedrich Schultz, a master of the Stockholm painters' guild. Between 1763 and 1765 Martin was at Sveaborg Castle in Finland, where he designed ornate figureheads for warships and taught military and topographical drawing. Carl August Ehrensv&auml;rd was among his pupils and Martin was taught the techniques of engraving by Ehrensv&auml;rd's father, commandant Augustin Ehrensv&auml;rd. In 1766 Martin went to Paris where, with the help of Alexander Roslin, he began to study under Joseph Vernet at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. In 1768 he went to London and the following year became a student at the Royal Academy of Arts of which in 1771 he became an associate. On 31 July 1770 he married Augusta Lee (<i>c</i>.1753&#150;1810) in London.<br>
<br>The work of English landscape painters began to influence Martin's work. Painting to order, he worked, from 1771, in watercolours, probably under the influence of Paul Sandby although in terms of style he was nearer to J. R. Cozens and Richard Wilson. About 1772 or 1773 Martin altered his technique; rather than making outline drawings in wash which were then coloured he began to use direct juxtapositions of pigments in order to heighten the power of the colours in his paintings. The high skies and unbroken horizons of his landscape paintings are reminiscent of Canaletto's compositions. Martin was particularly interested in representing the meeting of town and country, for example in <span class="italic">Stockholm from Mosebacke</span> (<i>c</i>.1795; City Hall, Stockholm). An important watercolour of the iron bridge at Coalbrookdale under construction in 1779 shows nature juxtaposed with heavy industry and, when rediscovered in 1997, threw important light on the construction of this pioneering industrial structure (Masreilez Rooms, Stockholm).<br>
<br>Martin drew warm and sympathetic sketches of everyday life, and his portraits and caricatures are often very expressively rendered. However his figures, which were enlivened by his calligraphic style, were also exaggerated in their proportions, as for example in <span class="italic">The Two Murderers in Macbeth</span> (1770s; National Museum, Stockholm), and led Horace Walpole to criticize Martin's technical ability in 1779. As an engraver he worked for, among others, the print publisher John Boydell.<br>
<br>Martin returned to Sweden in 1780 and the following year he became a member of Konstakademien, the Swedish Royal Academy of Arts, and in 1785 professor of landscape painting there. He lived with his family at Regeringsgatan 74. Gustav III commissioned many paintings from him, for example <span class="italic">Gustav III's Visit to the Academy of Arts</span> (1782; Drottningholm Palace, Bromma).<br>
<br>In 1780 he planned a series of prints for wide circulation, Sweden's first <i>voyage pittoresque</i> with Swedish views presented as coloured line etchings. They were etched by his brother Johan Fredric Martin, with whom he also collaborated on the publication of a number of other paintings and drawings.<br>
<br>Between 1788 and 1791 Martin was again in England, resident mainly in London and Bath, but little is known of his activities during this period. Back in Sweden in the 1790s his Romantic landscapes became &#145;increasingly pantheistic with a sublime treatment of light and dark&#146;  (Mawer, 485), but he also did a series of paintings of folk-life. Another important theme during this period was the dramatic depiction of industrial processes in furnaces and foundries. His last-known works date from 1808. In the last ten years of his life his reputation diminished considerably and he fell into ever greater obscurity. A household inventory taken after the death of his wife shows their house still to have been comfortably furnished in 1810, but Martin was later reduced to poverty, his circumstances made worse by blindness.<br>
<br>Martin took part in the Royal Academy's exhibitions of 1769&#150;74, 1777, 1779&#150;80, and 1790 and also in exhibitions arranged by the Society of Artists and the Free Society. Works by him were exhibited in the Swedish Academy of Arts exhibitions in Stockholm in 1794, 1799&#150;1800, 1804, 1806, 1809, and 1822. From 1804 to 1809 he had permanent exhibitions in his home on Kungsbacken. Martin died at his home, Kungsbacken 19, Stockholm, on 25 January 1818.<br>
<br>Martin brought to Sweden the English Romantic discovery of nature and in so doing broke the French stylistic hegemony over Swedish art; it was an approach that led his paintings to be described in Swedish as landscape portraits. His work has aroused conflicting assessments, but after being almost completely forgotten for a century his work became ever more highly prized in the twentieth century. The largest collections of Martin's works are to be found in Stockholm in the National Museum and the Royal Library, in Uppsala University Library, and in the Art Museum in Gothenberg.<br>

<a name="cosubject_18196"></a><span class="headword">Johan Fredric Martin</span>  (1755&#150;1816), <span class="occ">copperplate-engraver and etcher</span>, and brother of Elias Martin, was born in Stockholm and baptized there on 8 June 1755, which was probably also the date of his birth. From 1770 to 1780 Johan Fredric lived with his brother Elias in London, where he studied engraving with, among others, Francesco Bartolozzi and William Woollett. After returning to Sweden he worked on the portrait series <span class="italic">Swedish Gallery</span> (1782&#150;3) and the etchings of his brother's landscape sketches <span class="italic">Swedish Views</span> (1805&#150;12). His work consisted of about 300 prints, often in &#145;the manner of red chalk&#146; (exhibition catalogue of the Society of Artists, 1774; Fr&ouml;lich, 69).<br>
<br>From 1785 Johan Fredric was economically and artistically independent of his brother. In 1792 he married Christina Charlotta Westerberg (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1774). In 1815 he was appointed professor in graphic arts in the Konstakademien in Stockholm. He died on 28 September 1816 at Regeringsgatan 74, Stockholm, having taken over the house from his brother in or after 1788; he was survived by his wife.<br>
