<span class="headword">Fisher,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>1611/12, <em>d.</em> in or after 1656), <span class="occ">political and religious controversialist</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Fisher (<i>d</i>. 1654), knight, of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of Sir Thomas Challoner. On 25 August 1627, aged fifteen, he was admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating BA on 10 April 1630. The following year, it is recorded, there was &#145;Given by Edward Fisher Bachelor of Artes, a great Colledg pott&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brasenose College Quatercentenary Monographs</span>, 5, p. 18). At university Fisher acquired a reputation for his knowledge of ecclesiastical history and his skill in ancient languages. He supported the royalists in the civil war, issuing (anonymously) in autumn 1643 his <span class="italic">Appeal to the Conscience</span>, a work of some political sophistication. Here he sought to demonstrate the illegality of rebellion against the sovereign, and to rebut a range of counter-arguments, on the basis of religious, political, and legal principles, citing both an impressive range of scriptural precedents and such authorities as Bracton, Sir John Fortescue, and even Sir Edward Coke. Fisher may have moved to the royalist headquarters at Oxford, issuing there in 1644 <span class="italic">The Feast of Feasts, or, The Celebration of the Sacred Nativity</span>, a defence of the festivals of the church, especially Christmas, against puritan charges of popery, in which he pilloried the parliamentarian side as &#145;a rabble of all opinions&#146;, most of them heretical  (p. 2). Here and in <span class="italic">A Christian Caveat to the Old and New Sabbatarians</span> (1649) he also attacked sabbatarianism.<br>
<br>Fisher's whereabouts after the civil war are uncertain, but he may soon have returned to Gloucestershire. He was certainly there soon after his father's death on 29 December 1654, tangling with George Collier of Bocking over the power of ministers to refuse communion to the ignorant and scandalous of their flock; Collier mentions Fisher's having attended a religious lecture at Chipping Campden in March 1656. In <span class="italic">An Answer to Fifteen Questions Lately Published by Edward Fisher</span> Collier wrote to his friend Thomas Overbury of Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire, that Fisher had &#145;sent abroad these questions, containing a parecel of passionate and bitter insinuations against suspending ministers as he calls them&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>). Fisher opportunistically sought to curry favour with Independent opinion, by presenting the practice of exclusion as an aspect of &#145;binding and loosing&#146;: it was &#145;a sinful usurpation, and a high presumption for any man under the fictitious title of church officer&#146; thus to exclude  (Fisher, <span class="italic">Questions Preparatory to the Better, Free, and More Christian Administration of the Lords Supper</span>, 1655, 2). This startled his opponent, who knew Fisher's Anglican record: &#145;with me, tis a wonder, that he should once question this practice, since the Service book and Canons warrant, nay require it&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">An Answer</span>, 9). Fisher had inherited his father's estate at Mickleton but it was heavily encumbered with debt, and in 1656 he sold it to a Richard Graves. This did not put an end to his financial difficulties. Fisher decamped to Carmarthenshire, where he taught a school, but his creditors tracked him down, and he fled to Ireland. Anthony Wood was told that he died there at an unknown date, his wife (whose name is unknown) having predeceased him, and that his body was taken to London for burial.<br>
<br>Despite earlier controversy among historians, it cannot now be seriously doubted that Edward Fisher of Mickleton must be distinguished from <a name="cosubject_52753"></a><span class="headword">Edward Fisher</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1626&#150;1648), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, author of <span class="italic">The Marrow of Modern Divinity</span> (1645). In the 1640s the book's concessions to Arminianism won the approval of many who were challenging orthodox Calvinism from the Independent and sectarian left. Its republication by James Hog of Carnock led to bitter controversy within the Church of Scotland, in the course of which James Hadow suggested that its author had been a barber by trade, and therefore unqualified to pronounce on such matters. Hogg quoted Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxoniensis</span> to &#145;prove&#146; that Fisher was actually the man from Mickleton, but there is good reason not only to doubt this identification, but to believe that Hadow's claim, which may be traceable to the London&#150;Scottish presbyterian circles of the 1640s, was well founded.<br>
<br>Authorship of <span class="italic">The Marrow</span> was claimed by the person who wrote <span class="italic">A Touchstone for the Communicant</span> (1647) and <span class="italic">London's Gate to the Lord's Table</span> (1648), both concerning the question of exclusion from the sacrament. (The same man probably also wrote <span class="italic">Faith in Five Fundamental Principles</span> of 1650, a contribution to the common front of orthodox Christians against those radicals who were questioning the fundamentals of the faith.) He appears in these works as &#145;E. F.&#146;; his surname is known only from an allusion to it in Samuel Pretty's preface to the second edition of <span class="italic">The Marrow</span>. The prefatory addresses in this work by Pretty, Joshua Sprigge, William Strong, and Jeremiah Burroughs indicate that the author was a zealous puritan of their acquaintance, and therefore not identifiable with Edward Fisher of Mickleton. In <span class="italic">A Touchstone</span>, &#145;Simon&#146; tries to persuade his minister to exclude his neighbour &#145;Zacheus&#146; for sinfulness and ignorance; but Zacheus has committed only one great sin, of which he has repented. The minister is made to respond that Simon has &#145;come hither with a high conceit of himself&#146; as a man reputed to be &#145;of great knowledge and strict life&#146; but that he has &#145;too nearly resembled the Pharisees crowing over and undervaluing of the poor publican&#146;, and that he himself is unworthier of the sacrament  (pp. 54&#150;5). Here and in <span class="italic">London's Gate</span> the author seeks to articulate zealous, Independent reservations about the rigours of presbyterian discipline.<br>
<br>In his epistle to <span class="italic">The Marrow</span>, Fisher says he is &#145;a poor inhabitant of London&#146;, yet he had resources enough to acquire and study an impressive number of books for <span class="italic">The Marrow</span>. His reference to a consultation, after twelve years in error, with Thomas Hooker, the puritan minister who had fled England for the Netherlands in 1631 before taking ship two years later to New England, suggests a man already mature in the early 1630s; he nowhere claims to be a clergyman, but records that he was an ordinary member of a congregation. On 14 November 1626, an Edward Fisher was made free of his master Richard Marshalsey of the Company of Barber&#150;Surgeons, and this was certainly the Edward Fisher who appears in the poll tax returns for 1641, as a barber and member of that company, resident in the parish of St Sepulchre. This was the only person so named recorded among members of all the London companies in the returns of that year. It seems likely, in the light of Hadow's later assertion, that this was indeed the author of <span class="italic">The Marrow</span>.<br>
<br>Very little more can be hazarded about Fisher. Two of his patrons in the late 1640s were Sir Henry Rolle, chief justice of common pleas, and Colonel John Downes, MP for Arundel, Sussex. Fisher wrote in 1648 that Rolle had accepted &#145;the office of a ruling elder when you were chosen, in that congregation whereof you have been pleased to admit me a member&#146;, making the writer a lay member of a gathered congregation in or near London&#151;but nothing more is known at present about his life  (E. F., <span class="italic">London's Gate</span>, preface).<br>
