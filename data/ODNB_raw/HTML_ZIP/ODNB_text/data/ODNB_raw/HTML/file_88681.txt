<span class="headword">Besch,  Anthony John Elwyn</span>  (1924&#150;2002), <span class="occ">opera director</span>, was born at 193 Chatsworth Road, Kilburn, London, on 5 February 1924, the son of Roy Cressy Frederick Besch, chartered accountant, and his wife, Annie Gwendolen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones, both of 90 Fordwych Road, West Hampstead. He was educated at Rossall School, Lancashire, and then went up for a year to Worcester College, Oxford, before being enlisted in the artillery in 1943. He served in Sussex, Kent, India, and Malaya. On demobilization he returned to Oxford, where he completed his degree in English literature, graduating with a first-class degree in 1949.<br>
<br>In 1947, while still an undergraduate, Besch directed a successful production of Mozart's <span class="italic">Idomeneo</span>, then a rarity, for the Oxford University Opera Club. He followed this up the following year with <span class="italic">La clemenza di Tito</span>. He started his professional career in 1950 as assistant to Moran Caplat, general manager of Glyndebourne, a post he held until 1953, working with Carl Ebert and G&uuml;nther Rennert. He then staged two productions for Welsh National Opera in Cardiff, the world premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Menna</span> by Arwel Hughes in 1953 and Verdi's <span class="italic">The Sicilian Vespers</span> in 1954. In the latter opera he demonstrated outstanding ability for working with the chorus, then entirely amateur. For the Bath festival of 1955, he directed Gr&eacute;try's <span class="italic">Z&eacute;mire et Azor</span>, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. He returned to Glyndebourne in 1957 to direct Mozart's one-act <span class="italic">Der Schauspieldirektor</span>, and to Bath in 1959 to stage Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span>. That same year he directed <span class="italic">Rodelinda</span>, with Joan Sutherland in the title role, for the Handel Opera Society, and the British premi&egrave;re of Luigi Dallapiccola's <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span> for the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells Theatre. A busy year ended with two new productions for Sadler's Wells Opera (later English National Opera), Giordano's <span class="italic">Andrea Ch&eacute;nier</span> and Wagner's <span class="italic">Tannh&auml;user</span>.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Besch staged several notably successful productions for Sadler's Wells, including Bizet's <span class="italic">The Pearl Fishers</span> and Donizetti's <span class="italic">Don Pasquale</span> in 1960. These were followed by Strauss's <span class="italic">Ariadne on Naxos</span> in 1961 and Rossini's <span class="italic">Count Ory</span> in 1963. <span class="italic">Count Ory</span> was immensely popular and was revived again and again, even after the company moved to the much larger London Coliseum. Another Rossini opera, <span class="italic">The Thieving Magpie</span>, and Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">Queen of Spades</span> were well received in 1966. In 1963 Besch had begun a fruitful collaboration with Scottish Opera (under the directorship of Peter Hemmings) by staging Verdi's <span class="italic">Otello</span>, followed by Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span> in 1964 and Britten's <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span> in 1966. These were all popular, but his production of Mozart's <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> with Scottish Opera in 1967, starring Janet Baker and Elizabeth Harwood, was judged one of the finest opera productions of the decade and was revived over many years. During this period he also directed two first performances for the Aldeburgh festival, Lennox Berkeley's <span class="italic">The Castaway</span> in 1967 and Harrison Birtwistle's controversial <span class="italic">Punch and Judy</span> in 1968.<br>
<br>Besch was much in demand abroad. He travelled to Auckland for Bizet's <span class="italic">Carmen</span>; to Buenos Aires for Verdi's <span class="italic">Attila</span> and Strauss's <span class="italic">Elektra</span>; to the Wexford Festival for Gounod's <span class="italic">Mireille</span>, Rossini's <span class="italic">Otello</span>, and Puccini's <span class="italic">La rondine</span>; to Washington for Cavalli's <span class="italic">L'Ormindo</span>; to San Francisco for <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span>: and to New York City Opera for Charpentier's <span class="italic">Louise</span> and Britten's <span class="italic">Albert Herring</span>. He was director of the opera school at Toronto University for a year, during which he staged Rossini's <span class="italic">Turco in Italia</span> and Humphrey Searle's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>.<br>
<br>Besch continued to work with Scottish Opera throughout the 1970s, and some of his finest productions dated from that period. Britten's <span class="italic">Turn of the Screw</span> in 1970 toured to Iceland, and Strauss's <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> scored a triumph in 1971. Monteverdi's <span class="italic">Coronation of Poppea</span> was almost equally successful in 1973. The premi&egrave;re of Iain Hamilton's <span class="italic">Catiline Conspiracy</span> and a production of Gluck's <span class="italic">Alceste</span> made an interesting contrast in 1974, while <span class="italic">Ariadne on Naxos</span> in 1975 was very popular. Besch added Britten's <span class="italic">Rape of Lucretia</span> to the repertory in 1976, and in 1980 Puccini's <span class="italic">Tosca</span>, controversially set during the Second World War, annoyed some people but pleased most. Such departures from traditional staging were rare for Besch, who usually followed the example of his mentor, Carl Ebert, with imaginative but uncontroversial productions. However, his choice of operas to direct was often untraditional, as his work with the New Opera Company demonstrated. He staged magnificent productions of Shostakovich's comic opera <span class="italic">The Nose</span> and of Szymanowski's <span class="italic">King Roger</span>. He directed the British premi&egrave;res of Alberto Ginastera's <span class="italic">Bomarzo</span> in 1976 and Bohuslav Martin&#367;'s <span class="italic">Julietta</span> in 1978, both given excellent performances by the New Opera Company in conjunction with English National Opera at the Coliseum. Meanwhile, in 1974 Besch directed an acclaimed production of <span class="italic">La clemenza di Tito</span> for the Royal Opera at Covent Garden, and the same year staged the German premi&egrave;re of Britten's <span class="italic">Death in Venice</span> at the Deutsche Oper, Berlin. He followed a popular production of <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span> for English National Opera in 1975 with a successful <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> in 1976. Abroad, he worked in Houston, Miami, and St Louis; and in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane.<br>
<br>From 1986 to 1989 Besch was head of opera studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. During his tenure there he staged notable productions of Martin&#367;'s <span class="italic">Julietta</span>; the first British performance of Rossini's <span class="italic">Il viaggio a Reims</span>; Bizet's <span class="italic">La jolie fille de Perth</span>; Offenbach's comic opera <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>; Musgrave's <span class="italic">Voice of Ariadne</span>; and Rossini's <span class="italic">La pietra del paragone</span>. In 1993 he directed a particularly enjoyable production of Haydn's <span class="italic">L'infedelta delusa</span> for Garsington Opera. After his retirement Besch lived in Richmond, Surrey. In 1999 he suffered a mild stroke, which slowed him down to an extent he found frustrating. He died on 23 December 2002 at Bridge House, 64 High Street, Twyford, Berkshire, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his long-term partner, the Australian production designer John Stoddart.<br>
