<span class="headword">Fall,  James</span>  (1646/7&#150;1711), <span class="occ">university principal and Church of Scotland and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born of unknown parents, who were related to merchants in Leith and Dunbar. He graduated MA at Edinburgh University in 1665. After serving as governor in the family of Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall he accompanied the sons of Sir George Mowat of Ingliston to France in 1672. Later he attended Lord Charles Bruce at Utrecht and Paris. The bishop of London ordained him deacon in 1678 and priest in 1679. From 1680 to 1683 Fall acted as governor to the earl of Queensberry's two eldest sons in France and Italy and left an account of their travels, eventually published as <span class="italic">Memoires of my Lord Drumlangrig's &hellip; Travells Abroad</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Fall's acquaintance with Catholic and protestant scholars and divines in France broadened his theological and ecclesiastical outlook, and reinforced the pietistic influence of Archbishop Robert Leighton. Scottish friends and patrons consulted him about their foreign book purchases. Thanks to Queensberry he became historiographer royal in 1682, but although he translated some Italian histories, he is not known to have written any historical work.<br>
<br>Appointed principal of Glasgow University in June 1684 Fall was created doctor of theology at St Andrews on 6 August. As principal he made a lasting contribution by improvements to the buildings and precincts. Losing the favour of the duke of Perth in 1686 he was replaced as historiographer by Christopher Irvine. In 1689 he was an important agent representing the grievances of the rabbled and deprived episcopal clergy at court. Although a Williamite and generously latitudinarian, he could not conform to the re-established presbyterian system nor subscribe to the confession of faith. When reluctantly depriving Fall of office in September 1690 the commissioners of visitation of the university acknowledged his good management and his improvement of its revenues.<br>
<br>It was owing to the archbishops of Canterbury and York, rather than to his old friend Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, that Fall was appointed precentor of York Minster in February 1692. In this refuge he gladly adapted to Anglican ways, leading the daily offices, modulating his accent, and becoming a respected member of the cathedral community and of antiquarian circles. His friend Sir Robert Sibbald described him as &#145;of great learning, of a penetrating mind, and of a solid judgement, one that knoweth the world, men and business well&#146;  (Maidment, 135). As executor of Robert Leighton, Fall edited and published his commentaries and discourses on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and the first epistle of <span class="roman">Peter</span> in 1693 and 1694. He maintained warm friendships across the confessional divide in Scotland, and revisited Scotland to help the trustees of Leighton's library at Dunblane.<br>
<br>Appointed archdeacon of Cleveland in 1700 Fall also enjoyed the wealthy rectory of Londesborough, 1707&#150;8. Having bequeathed his fine French and Italian books to the minster library, he died unmarried at his home in Minster Yard, York, on 12 June 1711, aged sixty-four, and was buried in the lady chapel of the minster.<br>
