<span class="headword">Ashton, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1354&#150;<em>c.</em>1398), <span class="occ">soldier and landowner</span>, was the son and heir of Sir John Ashton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1360) of Ashton under Lyne, Lancashire, and of Margaret, a daughter of Robert del Leigh of Adlington, Cheshire. His mother's second marriage, to William Radcliffe of Todmorden, Lancashire, took place while Ashton was still a child, and intensified an existing struggle for control of his estates. He had barely reached the age of twelve when his stepfather sought to tighten his grip on the property by arranging for him to marry into his own prolific and influential family. By <i>c</i>.1366 Ashton had married his first wife, Joan, the daughter of William Radcliffe of Smithills, Lancashire, and they eventually had five sons and a daughter, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/773/', "Sir John Ashton (d. 1427)")</script>, soldier and administrator, whose careers Ashton assiduously fostered, although during his early life he showed little interest in county society or the dynastic politics of the local gentry. Instead, following the example of his father, who had fought with distinction overseas, he assumed the profession of arms.<br>
<br>As a mere youth, in 1369, Ashton served in France with John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and was still under age when, in 1373, he accompanied Sir William Windsor, the governor, to Ireland. Ashton entered his inheritance some two years later, being then old enough to sue his former guardians for revenues optimistically valued at &pound;100 per annum, misappropriated during the fifteen years in which they had managed his affairs. Such unambiguous evidence about his adolescence, together with the fact that he was not knighted until later, renders suspect any identification with the Sir John Assueton &#145;a very valiant and able man&#146;, said by Froissart to have performed various feats of arms at the siege of Noyon in 1370. Yet he was already a seasoned campaigner when Gaunt retained him formally, as a belted knight, at &pound;20 a year in 1377; and he soon returned to France under the ducal banner.<br>
<br>The support of so powerful a patron must have been invaluable to Ashton in his legal battles, while he, in turn, was able to perform many services for the duke. Gaunt's pursuit of a claim to the throne of Castile required financial backing from an unenthusiastic House of Commons, and in October 1382 Ashton managed to be returned to parliament by the electors of Lancashire so that he could promote the venture. It would, however, be mistaken to regard him as a placeman without a voice or mind of his own. On the contrary, he was eminently qualified, in terms of age, property, and experience, to represent the county of his birth. Nor was he afraid to incur the duke's displeasure. Once the Commons had rejected Gaunt's unpopular proposal in favour of a &#145;crusade&#146; to be led by Bishop Henry Despenser against the schismatics in Flanders, Ashton actually took the cross and joined the rival expedition himself. Neither this ill-fated exercise (supported by few other Lancastrian retainers), nor an equally unsuccessful invasion of Scotland led by Richard II in 1385 brought any glory to Sir John or the other participants. His defection to the bishop may, moreover, have soured relations between him and his patron, for, when Gaunt left for Spain in 1386, he stayed behind on his Lancashire estates. Given, however, that he continued to associate with other members of the ducal entourage and also to draw his annuity, the breach cannot have been too serious.<br>
<br>Having already taken a seat on the local bench in 1384 and served occasionally as a royal commissioner, it seems that Ashton now wished to lead the life of a country gentleman, perhaps disillusioned by his recent experiences in the field. He attended two more parliaments, in September 1388 and January 1390, and died shortly before Gaunt, about 1398. His connection with the house of Lancaster was continued by four of his sons, each of whom found favour under Henry IV; and it is worth noting that this attachment was shared by the family of his second wife (whose name is unknown), a daughter of Robert Staveley of Cheshire.<br>
