<span class="headword">Calcutt, Sir  David Charles</span>  (1930&#150;2004), <span class="occ">barrister and college head</span>, was born on 2 November 1930 at Berkeley Nursing Home, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the only child of Alfred Henry (Harry) Calcutt (<i>d</i>. 1972), pharmacist, and his wife, Christine Linda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Young. His early life was shaped by his musicality. A chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, he was a music scholar at Cranleigh School, and a choral scholar at King's College, Cambridge. At university he achieved a unique simultaneous double of a BMus and an LLB, an achievement only faintly impaired by his position in the third class in law.<br>
<br>This inauspicious start proved no handicap to Calcutt's successful legal career, which was fuelled by a combination of a fine voice and robust common sense. After national service in the army, during which he attained the rank of captain, he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1955. He took silk in 1972 and four years later became the head of his chambers in Lamb Building in the Temple which he ran until 1988 as, in the words of a senior colleague, a &#145;despot but as benevolent a despot as one could find&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 14 Aug 2004). His most notable case was before the European Court of Human Rights in 1981 when he appeared for three railwaymen dismissed by British Rail for refusing to join a union, a breach of article 12 of the European convention on human rights which guarantees freedom of association but also, as he successfully argued, freedom not to associate (<i>Young v. UK</i>, 1981). In 1970 Calcutt became deputy chairman of the Somerset quarter sessions and he was a recorder between 1972 and 1989. Chairman of the Bar Council (1984&#150;5), he served as treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1998 and between 1978 and 2000 was a judge of the Courts of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.<br>
<br>Nomination to the Channel Islands appellate judiciary is conventionally accorded to those destined for a seat on the High Court bench or to those who have had, but rejected, that opportunity. Calcutt was one of a small but growing number in the second category who saw the benefits of a portfolio life outside the confines of the law courts, and indeed beyond London. In 1986 he was appointed as master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he had taught law courses during the 1970s. During his six highly successful years as master he led the college, the last in Cambridge to have an all-male membership, to become co-educational. He compensated for waning fee income by waxing fund-raising, and extended the college estates on both sides of the River Cam. Above all he had a natural affinity with the young that was noteworthy given that his marriage&#151;on 23 August 1969, to Barbara Ann Walker (<i>b</i>. 1929/30), a psychiatric social worker and daughter of William Vivian Walker, businessman&#151;was childless. Both Calcutt and his wife attached great importance to Magdalene's undergraduates, and the quality of their time at the college: &#145;It's the kids who matter here; they come first&#146;, was a typical comment  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 14 Aug 2004).<br>
<br>While Calcutt's college duties took precedence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they were not exclusive. His reputation for fairness and his authoritative presence made him a natural choice for important quasi-judicial posts. He had previously acted as an inspector for the Department of Trade (1974&#150;7) in the wake of the secondary banking crisis and as chairman of the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal (1979&#150;84). In 1984 he conducted his first government inquiry into a fire at a hospital in the Falkland Islands, followed by reports on security procedures in Cyprus and Northern Ireland. While master of Magdalene College he was appointed president of the Lloyds of London Appeal Tribunal (1987&#150;97), chair of the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (1989&#150;2000), and a member of the Interception of Communications Tribunal (1986&#150;2001), and later sat on the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (2000&#150;04). For twelve years from 1989 he was the Home Office's assessor of compensation for miscarriages of justice&#151;a position where the absence of guiding precedent compelled the exercise of a responsible judgement that he possessed in full measure. In that capacity he awarded almost &pound;1 million to Patrick Hill, one of the Birmingham six who was held to have been wrongly convicted in 1975 for the bombing of two public houses the previous year, and released on appeal in 1991. Calcutt sought to explain every award, even if his explanations did not always satisfy either the beneficiaries or the public&#151;proof, it may be said, of his even-handed approach. He also fixed compensation for victims of crime on behalf of the Criminal Injury Compensation Board, though his own fee of &pound;20 per case was scarcely an incentive to perform this complex function.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Calcutt had supplemented his income as a reporter for, and later editor of, <span class="italic">The Times</span> law reports. In 1989 he revived his connection with the press when he became chairman of the committee on privacy and related matters, which was set up in response to concerns over media intrusion and calls by some MPs for laws to protect personal privacy. Calcutt's report called for the creation of a new offence of invasion of privacy (which was not accepted by the government) and the establishment of a self-regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission, which came into being in 1991. Calcutt was conscious that press liberty could become press licence, and that self-regulation ran the risk of becoming self-preservation. Eighteen months later he undertook a review of self-regulation in action. Critical of what he saw as a body &#145;set up by the industry &hellip; dominated by the industry &hellip; and over-favourable to the industry&#146;, he recommended that the commission be replaced by a statutory tribunal  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Jan 1993). His proposal, which drew strong criticism and some personal attacks in the press, was again not taken up by the government.<br>
<br>Alongside law, music remained Calcutt's passion throughout his life. In 1956 he co-founded the Edington music festival in Wiltshire, and was its director until 1964, as well as the deputy chairman of the Royal College of Music (1988&#150;90). A practising member of the Church of England, he served as chancellor of the diocese of Exeter and of Bristol from 1971 and of Europe (formerly Gibraltar in Europe) from 1983. He was knighted in 1991. In his later years he suffered from Parkinson's disease and he died at his home, Twitchen Cottage, Porlock, near Minehead, Somerset, on 11 August 2004 from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage. He was survived by his wife.<br>
