<span class="headword">King, Sir  Alexander Boyne</span>  (1888&#150;1973), <span class="occ">cinema manager and booking agent</span>, was born on 24 October 1888 at 113 McLean Street, Govan, Glasgow, the only son of James L. King, clerk, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyne. He was educated at Rutland Crescent School, Glasgow. His father died when King was just twelve years old. With his mother to provide for, he started working at a bakers in the morning and as a programme seller at the Royal Princess's Theatre in the evenings while still attending school in between. A story that as a programme seller he collected discarded programmes at the end of each performance and took them home, where his mother ironed them so that he could resell them the next evening, turned out to be a myth stemming from a tale told by his friend the music hall star Harry Lauder. In later life he recalled that his greatest thrill was when he handed his first wages to his mother.<br>
<br>On leaving school King worked at the Clyde Navigation Trust, while still at the Princess in the evenings. Rich Waldon built the Palace Theatre next door and appointed King as head programme boy. He then found evening work at the Grand Theatre in Cowcaddens, as ticket tearer and cashier. His enthusiasm and hard work led to swift promotion to assistant manager. Experience at the Grand led him, together with some friends, to invest in the Lorne Cinema in 1914. He booked films with big names like Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, which drew crowds and established the Lorne as &#145;one of the best of Glasgow's numerous cinema entertainments&#146;, according to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Observer</span> in 1915  (Peter, 89). By 1920 his cinemas were known as the King Circuit (with King on the board of some and booking films for all of them), and he was a member of the Scottish branch of the Cinematographer Exhibitors' Association; by 1924 he was elected as Scottish delegate to the association's national council. On 24 April 1919 at Burlington House, Glasgow, he had married Helen Craig (1892/3&#150;1965), daughter of John Craig, shipping clerk, of Glasgow. They had two daughters, Eleanore and Xandra.<br>
<br>In 1928 Caledon Pictures Ltd became the new owners of the Lorne Cinema and King became a director. By this point he was responsible as booking manager for many of Glasgow's independent cinemas. He took over the Lyceum in Govan, where twelve years earlier he had been turned away when scouting for work. There his entrepreneurial skills became evident when screenings of <span class="italic">The Man in Mexico</span> were attended by usherettes and ushers donned in ponchos and sombreros, much to the delight of audiences. Soon King became booking manager for the Inverness-based Caledonian Associated Cinemas, helping to expand the business from nine cinemas in the north-east in 1935 to forty-nine throughout Scotland by 1950, by when it was a rival to the ABC franchise.<br>
<br>King's light, cheery manner endeared him to film artists on both sides of the Atlantic, making him an ideal publicist for many Scottish events. Accordingly he was made chairman of the special attractions committee for the Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston in 1938. He was responsible for publicity and managed to entice the likes of Gracie Fields, Anna Neagle, Eddie Cantor, and Charles Laughton. He later recounted his difficulty in introducing Gracie Fields to a crowd of 80,000 people. After he made several attempts at an introduction, Fields shouted out, &#145;Come on baldy, speak up!&#146;  (House, 3).<br>
<br>In 1937 King was appointed CBE. As film officer for Scotland he directed the Scottish evacuation film scheme for the Department of Health in Scotland at the outbreak of the Second World War, which provided cinema entertainment for evacuees. He later took up the post of chairman of the Scottish advisory committee of the Ministry of Information, in which he proved his skills in international relations, providing hospitality for overseas troops visiting Scotland. He was knighted in 1944 in recognition of his wartime activities with the Ministry of Information and his great works of charity in support of the war effort. He received this accolade in an air raid shelter under Buckingham Palace.<br>
<br>By the mid-1940s King was booking for about ninety cinemas throughout Scotland. A strong believer in worthy causes, by 1954 he had raised over &pound;100,000 for Scottish charities. He relentlessly and tirelessly campaigned for a reduction in the entertainment tax imposed on cinema exhibitors, outraged at the unfair rates, then set at seven times those on theatres and music halls. His aim was for cinemas to pay the same amount as theatres, and he had already succeeded in a reduction in tax on seats costing up to 6<i>d</i>. by the mid-1930s, which helped smaller independent exhibitors. When he became annual president of the Cinematographer Exhibitors' Association in 1949 he championed the cause of the British Film Producers Association, winning the support of producers as well as exhibitors and renters. He also served as chairman of the Films of Scotland Committee, which had existed briefly from 1938 until the Second World War broke out, then was revived in 1954, lasting until 1982. This was an important body in which, as chairman, King encouraged the promotion of Scottish life and culture through film, helping producers to get their films made and even helping Walt Disney when he made a film about Scotland for his <span class="roman">People and Places</span> series. He assisted the producers of <span class="italic">The Lilt and the Kilt</span>, the first cinemascope film on Scotland, and helped to have a film made about Burns country. As a leading independent distributor he ensured that Scottish films would have access to distribution.<br>
<br>In the 1950s King was made vice-chairman and treasurer of the Scottish Tourist Board, where he supervised the worldwide distribution of documentary films about Scotland. In 1960 he also became chairman of Grampian Television for eight years. He received an honorary doctorate in law from Glasgow University in 1957, as well as an honorary fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. His lifetime ventures and achievements were all conducted with an enthusiasm and humour that never waned. He was a great supporter of Scottish causes, although, as reported in the <span class="italic">Kinematograph Weekly</span> in 1949, &#145;I've never in my life owned a kilt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kinematograph Weekly</span>, 15 Dec 1949). He died on 12 February 1973 at 309 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, following a heart attack, and was survived by his two daughters.<br>
