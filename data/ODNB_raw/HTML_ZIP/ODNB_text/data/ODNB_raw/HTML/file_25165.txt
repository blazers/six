<span class="headword">Seymour,  Edward James</span>  (1796&#150;1866), <span class="occ">physician</span>, third son of William Seymour of 65 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, London, and his wife, Thyphena Letithoea, eldest daughter of Daniel Foulston of London, was born on 30 March 1796, and baptized at the church of St Nicholas, Lower Tooting. His father, a member of a family settled in Lincolnshire in the middle of the seventeenth century, was a solicitor, who lived in Brighton for thirty years and who also practised as a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Sussex, and chairman of the quarter sessions. Edward Seymour received his education at Richmond School, Surrey, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in January 1816, MA in 1819, and MD in 1826. He received a licence <i>ad practicandum</i> from his university in 1822. He also studied medicine in London, Edinburgh, and Paris; he was admitted an inceptor candidate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1823, a candidate in 1826, and a fellow in 1827. At the college he subsequently held the posts of Goulstonian lecturer in 1829, censor in 1830, Croonian lecturer in 1831, and <i>consiliarius</i> in 1836. On 4 September 1817 Seymour married Maria Searancke of Clapton, London, and they had a family of six sons and four daughters. The eldest son, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Frederick Seymour CB, of the 84th regiment, was acting adjutant-general at the siege of Lucknow.<br>
<br>The first years of Seymour's career were spent in Italy, mainly at Florence, where he had a large income and made some influential friends who were of use to him on his return to Britain. In 1823 he settled again in England, and established himself at 23 George Street, Hanover Square, London, soon acquiring a high-class practice. On 28 November 1828 he was elected physician to St George's Hospital; he held the post until 1847, and rose to be senior physician. Seymour had an aptitude for bedside teaching. Shortly after settling in London he became physician to the hospital ship <i>Dreadnought</i> at Greenwich, and he subsequently became consulting physician to the Royal Naval Hospital. He was also physician to the duke of Sussex. From 1 September 1831 to 1839 Seymour was a metropolitan commissioner in lunacy; he came to devote much of his attention to cases of insanity, and was one of the first to use opium freely in the treatment of the insane. In 1859 he published a letter, which he addressed to the earl of Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">On the laws which regulate private lunatic asylums, with a comparative view of the process &#145;de lunatico inquirendo&#146; in England and the law of France</span>. The letter contains a few observations on the causes of insanity and on the improvement in the treatment of mental diseases during the preceding twenty-five years. On 17 June 1841 Seymour was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; he was also a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and a member of the Royal Medical Society and the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh, and of the Imperial and Royal Academy of Science of Siena.<br>
<br>Seymour was an accomplished man outside the range of his professional practice. His main works were <span class="italic">Diseases of the Ovaria</span> (with a volume of plates, 1830); <span class="italic">Observations on the Medical Treatment of Insanity</span> (1832); and <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Treatment of Several Severe Diseases of the Human Body</span> (1847). Seymour suffered from poor health and financial misfortune in his later years and died at his residence, 13 Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 16 April 1866, from organic disease of the stomach and liver. He was survived by his wife.<br>
