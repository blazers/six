<span class="headword">Sangster,  John Young <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1896&#150;1977), <span class="occ">motorcycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 29 May 1896 at Northfield, near Birmingham, the second of three sons of Charles Thomas Brock Sangster, a Birmingham engineer and businessman of Scottish origin and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wicks. He was educated at Hurstpierpoint College in Sussex. Then it is believed he underwent apprenticeship in French and German cycle and car factories, where he acquired linguistic ability. The outbreak of war terminated this training and he served in the City of Birmingham battalion of the 14th Royal Warwickshire regiment from 1914 to 1918.<br>
<br>About 1896, Sangster's father had joined the Cycle Components Manufacturing Company in Birmingham, becoming managing director in 1897. This firm acquired the Ariel Cycle Company, also in Birmingham, and the first Ariel motor tricycle was exhibited in 1898, followed by a car in 1900 and a motorcycle in 1905. After the war, Jack Sangster, as he was known, developed a motor quadricycle at a factory in Tyseley belonging to his father's company. The design was taken over by the Rover Company in Coventry and became the Rover Eight car, a &#145;simple, yet efficient, little air-cooled, flat-twinned&#146; 1000 cc or 8 hp car  (Holliday, 63). Rover gave Sangster a job in Coventry producing the car where &#145;he won a good name for himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 March 1977). He left in 1923 to join his father at Components and by 1930 was its joint managing director with his father. The Ariel Nine and Ten cars were his idea though inappropriate for a firm already doing badly in the depression and facing competition from Morris and Austin.<br>
<br>A better future appeared to lie with motorcycles. Edward Turner, Val Page, and Bert Hopwood were on the design staff at this time. However, Components was driven into receivership in 1932, and Sangster was able to buy the machinery and part of the premises at Dale Road in Bournbrook, Selly Oak, beside the university, to form Ariel Motors. He was the chairman and main shareholder, assisted in a minor way by his brother Harvey; his father died in 1935. Ariel went on making motorcycles, for the army during the war, until Sangster sold out to the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1944 for &pound;376,257. The factory closed in 1963.<br>
<br>Sangster's ambition led him to acquire other, bigger, interests. In 1935 he bought the Triumph motorcycle business (not the car side) and its Priory works in Coventry for &pound;50,000 from the receiver. He was chairman from 1936 to 1964. He brought across Edward Turner and Bert Hopwood from Ariel as manager and designer. Sangster drove the Triumph Engineering Company hard: staff either left or took a pay cut, sales managers were pushed out on to the road to sell, and new models were produced, including the famous Speed Twin and the Tiger. One model, in 1937, could do 90 m.p.h. In 1936, the New Imperial motorcycle company was absorbed. Success was achieved.<br>
<br>The war brought changes. Priory works was only 200 yards from Coventry Cathedral and was destroyed during the same air raid in November 1940. Production continued in temporary premises and a new works was built at Meriden on the edge of Coventry in 1942. Peace brought a modest expansion at Meriden and the firm went from strength to strength. Triumph produced 5000 motorcycles a year very profitably (in contrast to BSA which produced 50,000 much less profitably).<br>
<br>However, Sangster became concerned at the impact his death duties could have on the firm and he and Turner decided to sell out to BSA in 1951 for &pound;2.5 million. Sangster became a director, bringing much needed motorcycle expertise to the BSA board, then chaired by Sir Bernard Docker and managed by James Leek. Sangster and Leek led the attack on Docker's mistaken emphasis on the Daimler car side and his (and his wife's) flamboyant extravagances. As a result, Sangster became chairman from 1956 until 1961, retiring when he reached sixty-five. Although he guided BSA through a period of good profitability, he failed to update the technology in production and design or to expand production sufficiently to meet demand, let alone the potential demand that subsequent new models and sympathetic marketing generated in the 1970s. As a result, BSA and Triumph gradually yielded their place as world leaders to France and Italy (in mopeds and scooters) in the 1950s and to Japan (in under-350 cc and finally the 500&#150;1000 cc motorcycles) in the 1960s. The failure seems to have lain with the main board and not with middle management. Apart from Sangster, Edward Turner and Sangster's successor, Eric Turner, have a great deal to answer for in this decline to extinction in the early 1970s. Sangster remained as a director of BSA until he was seventy-two. However, he had been living in London from about 1953 and so was seldom seen at either BSA's works at Small Heath or Triumph's at Meriden.<br>
<br>Bob Holliday described Sangster as having a &#145;clever head for business with a trained mechanical mind, attributes that enabled him to select the right men as his lieutenants and to evaluate the potentialities of a good design when he saw one&#146;  (Holliday, 63). Even Hopwood considered him &#145;needlesharp&#146;  (Hopwood, 13) and <span class="italic">The Times</span> called him &#145;a formidable leader of design and production teams&#146;. Subsequent history casts some doubt on whether this acumen continued into the late 1950s. A rather different impression is given by the <span class="italic">Birmingham Mail</span>'s &#145;shy millionaire&#146; dictum of 1 June 1956 .<br>
<br>Motorcycling was one of Sangster's recreations, along with motoring, skiing, and yachting. He married three times, first in 1923 to Kathleen Burns; they had one daughter, Heather. His second marriage was in 1951, to Phyllis, daughter of Frederick K. Hamer, a retired colonel, and the third, in 1963, to Margery, daughter of Robert Cheney Hart, a company director. Margery and Heather survived him. He died of cancer at his home, 34 Ennismore Gardens, Westminster, London, on 26 March 1977.<br>
