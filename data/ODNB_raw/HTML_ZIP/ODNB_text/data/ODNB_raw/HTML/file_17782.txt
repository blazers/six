<span class="headword">Magill,  Robert</span>  (1788&#150;1839), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and poet</span>, son of George Frederic Magill and Sarah Boyd, was born on 7 September 1788 in the village of Broughshane, near Ballymena, co. Antrim. When he was ten years old the United Irish rising broke out, and his manuscript autobiography contains some vivid pictures of the scenes which he witnessed. After attending local schools, he himself became a teacher, first at Ballyportre, near Loughguile, in his native county, and afterwards in Broughshane. In 1811, having determined to study for the church, he placed himself under the tuition of the Revd John Paul (1777&#150;1848), of Carrickfergus. In 1813 he entered the University of Glasgow, walking, according to the custom of Ulster students of that day, to Donaghadee, a distance of over 30 miles; after a twelve-hour passage to Portpatrick, he spent three days walking to Glasgow. He graduated MA at the university in 1817, and in addition to his proper professional studies attended several of the medical classes. His poetical gifts had already manifested themselves, and two poems which he wrote while at college, &#145;The Fall of Algiers&#146; and &#145;Currie's Elegy&#146;, were thought worthy to be recited by the public orator. During the long vacations he taught in Broughshane.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1818 Magill was licensed by the presbytery of Ballymena, in connection with the synod of Ulster, and on 20 June 1820, having received a unanimous call after four Sundays on &#145;trial&#146;, was ordained in Antrim as assistant and successor to Alexander Montgomery, minister of Mill Row Presbyterian Church. He soon acquired the reputation of being a talented preacher. &#145;He had a vivid imagination, and certain tones of his voice were so exquisitely tender that when touching on particular subjects he could almost at once melt an auditory into tears&#146;  (Reid, 3.555). His congregation increased greatly under his care, and a very large new church had to be built. Magill was married, on 11 December 1823, to Ann Jane (<i>b</i>. 1803), daughter of Samuel Skelton. They had a son and a daughter. His wife died on 14 September 1832 and he subsequently married Ellen, daughter of James Liggat, on 11 June 1838.<br>
<br>In the church courts, which were then agitated over the Arian controversy, Magill sided strongly with the orthodox party. At the suggestion of Dr Henry Cooke, the leader of the evangelicals, he wrote <span class="italic">The Thinking Few</span> (1828), the work by which he is best known. It is a satirical poem of considerable power, directed against the Arians, and had a very large circulation. It was published anonymously. Six years later he published his <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects, Chiefly Religious</span> (1834), some of which are marked by a deep vein of poetic sentiment. He died in Antrim on 19 February 1839, and was interred in the churchyard of Donegore after an initial burial in Templepatrick.<br>
