<span class="headword">Lowe,  Elizabeth</span>  (1829&#150;1897), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 18 May 1829, at St Vincent Street, Liverpool, the daughter of James Lowe (1795&#150;1834), a successful Liverpool solicitor, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parry (1803&#150;1887). The second of three surviving children, Elizabeth Lowe and her younger sister, Anne, were fortunate that their parents considered it important for the girls to share an education at home with their brother, James. They had tutors in classics, mathematics, and modern languages. However, the premature death of their father, when the children were still young, left the family in straitened circumstances. James took up journalism while Elizabeth spent three years travelling in France, Germany, and Italy before returning to England to find work.<br>
<br>By this time her brother was editor of <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. For Elizabeth Lowe, like many women journalists of her day, the encouragement, position, and contacts of a brother were to prove invaluable in starting out. James Lowe trained his sister in journalism and then commissioned her to supply book reviews and articles about art to <span class="italic">The Critic</span> and later <span class="italic">The Queen</span>. This journal, originally founded by Samuel Beeton, was bought in 1862 by Serjeant Cox, owner of <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. The following year Cox bought its rival, the <span class="italic">Ladies' Paper</span>, and the two then merged. Elizabeth Lowe was thus associated from the start with the new, enlarged magazine, called <span class="italic">The Queen: the Lady's Newspaper</span>, and in 1864 was offered the editorship of the combined journals while Horace Cox, nephew of Serjeant Cox, retained overall responsibility as manager and head of the enterprise.<br>
<br>When Lowe first took over, the magazine contained sixteen pages and was a rather prim society journal. By the time of her death it numbered 144 pages, including some ten pages of advertisements, and had become one of the most important magazines primarily for rich and leisured women, steering their sphere of interest towards politics and social matters without in any way neglecting the practical and domestic. Key elements in its success were the high-quality coloured fashion plates included in every issue as well as paper patterns as supplements, with designs for a variety of handwork such as decorative fretwork, lace, and Berlin woolwork. However, the success was not immediate. It was not until Lowe introduced the idea of dividing the paper into departments&#151;dress, home decorations, fashion, gardening, cooking, charities, women's employment&#151;and answered readers' queries on all these, that the circulation picked up. It then increased dramatically, although no figures have been kept. The response was enormous and a lively correspondence began between Lowe and her readers on almost all issues.<br>
<br>One of Lowe's most important editorial skills was an ability to attract very high profile contributors. She managed, for example, to secure original sketches by Queen Victoria for publication in the magazine, as well as articles and short stories by Mrs Lynn Linton, Walter Besant, and several princesses. At the same time she acquired a reputation as a generous supporter of struggling writers and artists and an editor who inspired her staff with her composure, strong personality, and powers of leadership. However sympathetic an ear she proffered to female journalists, she did not put aside her sound editorial judgement merely because a woman needed work. &#145;They make me feel like a brute because I must cut down or return their articles&#146;, she once said in a rare interview  (<span class="italic">The Queen</span>, 12 June 1897).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lowe must have moved effortlessly in the top echelons of British society to produce the journal which <span class="italic">The Queen</span> became, and yet she steadfastly avoided making herself well known to a wider public. She refused nearly every request for an interview or for her portrait to be published. Her own magazine admitted in an obituary notice that a picture of its former editor would be of great interest to its readers, yet refused to publish one, adding that &#145;she retained her good looks and fine presence to the last&#146;.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Lowe lived for her work and had little recoverable private life beyond it. However, she had regular Sunday afternoon At Homes where a large circle of friends would gather. She would never discuss politics on these occasions, but was a born raconteur with a shrewd and racy humour. In <span class="italic">The Queen</span> too, she retained an objectivity on political matters and refused to give a platform to any one view. The last issue she produced carried an article on the subject of women's suffrage in New Zealand, which commented:<blockquote>That the influence of women in politics and their voting will not be different from that of their husbands and brothers may be regarded as foregone conclusion, and should this much debated reform come into actual operation in the UK it is probable that it will not produce the effects that are hoped for by its promoters and apprehended by its adversaries. (1 May 1897)</blockquote>Elizabeth Lowe died at Victoria House, 46 Gillingham Street, London, on 1 June 1897, from a skin and ear complaint after an illness lasting some five months. She was sixty-eight. She was buried on 4 June at Brookwood cemetery, Woking, in Surrey, in the same grave as her brother, James, who had died, aged thirty-seven, in November 1865. Her sister's husband, Richard Stott Deane, was with her when she died, and the editorship of <span class="italic">The Queen</span> passed to his daughter, Lowe's niece, Ethel Deane. From the poverty of her young womanhood, Lowe acquired a considerable fortune, leaving more than &pound;20,000 in her will.<br>
