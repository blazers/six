<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Isham,  John</span>  (1525&#150;1596), <span class="occ">merchant and gentleman</span>, was born in August 1525, probably at Ringstead, Northamptonshire, the fourth surviving son of Euseby Isham (<i>d</i>. 1546) and Ann, daughter of Giles Poulton, esquire. In spite of their father's modest circumstances (John received only &pound;3 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. by the terms of his father's will) the children were successful. Of John's brothers, Giles (<i>d</i>. 1559) trained in the law and became steward to Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, while Robert (<i>d</i>. 1564) entered the priesthood and became a chaplain to Mary I. Gregory (<i>d</i>. 1558) and Henry (<i>d</i>. after 1595), like John, were destined for commercial careers, all three being apprenticed in the Mercers' Company of London.<br>
<br>John Isham was apprenticed to Otwell Hill, mercer and merchant adventurer, in 1542, but on the death of his master the following year he was transferred to Thomas Gigges to serve the rest of his nine-year term. He later recalled that he did not refuse &#145;servile works&#146; such as &#145;caryinge the water tankard bockets to the Temes&#146;  (Ramsay, 170), but he was clearly properly trained in mercantile arts, and seems to have spent time in Antwerp working as a factor. He became free of the company in 1551, and very shortly afterwards, on 6 October 1552, married Elizabeth Barker (<i>d</i>. 1594), the widow of Leonard Barker, a fellow merchant adventurer. The marriage was critical to the establishment of his fortunes, for he became trustee of the bulk of the Barker fortune (Barker's moveables had been valued at &pound;1195 net on his death) on behalf of his wife's infant sons. John also benefited from the fact that his brother Gregory, who became free of the Mercers in 1546, and with whom John was probably in partnership, had already established a successful business and was in the process of acquiring an estate in land worth &pound;400 p.a.<br>
<br>The Ishams traded on the London&#150;Antwerp axis, concentrating on the exchange of Suffolk, Somerset, and Wiltshire broadcloths and Yorkshire kerseys for silks and luxury cloths. They were among the middle-ranking exporters: in the year from Michaelmas 1553 John exported 386 cloths and Gregory 428; in 1556&#150;7 John exported 556 cloths and Gregory 466. The business operations required John to make regular visits to the dealers in kerseys at Halifax, but the Antwerp end of the business seems to have been handled by a succession of factors. The 1560s were more difficult years for trading because of successive disruptions of the Antwerp mart arising from political problems, and Isham began to reduce the scale of his business. He also increased his investment in the wool trade, drawing on his Northamptonshire connections and selling wool to the clothiers in exchange for their cloths. These years brought him the beginnings of civic recognition, with his election as renter warden of the Mercers' Company in 1567, and the opportunities for liberal hospitality arising from the company's feast, for which he provided thirty-three bucks, many of them through his Northamptonshire connections. &#145;Not one man before his tyme nor sens &hellip; had the lyke by a great many&#146; claimed his biographer  (Ramsay, 171).<br>
<br>Isham resided successively at Bow Lane and (from 1560) St Sithe's Lane in the London parish of St Antholin's, with a suburban retreat at Tottenham. But in 1560 he took a key decision in acquiring from Sir William Cecil the manor of Lamport in Northamptonshire for &pound;610. The purchase had required financial help from his brother Robert, who seems to have been opposed to John's schemes for the enclosure of the estate, but he died in 1564, and John was able to buy out the executors' interest. In 1570 he began the process of enclosure by a series of agreements with the tenants, and the process accelerated with his decision to leave London and settle permanently at Lamport in 1572. As his biographer recalled, &#145;heer he aplyed him self to plantinge, buildinge, makinge of poales, includeinge of grounds and all other woorkes of good husbandry, as though he had been brought up in them from his infancy&#146;  (Ramsay, 171). In 1568 he had acquired the long lease of the profitable rectory, along with its parsonage house which he converted into a manor house. Although he was farming on a large scale (by August 1583 he had 1572 sheep) his gross annual income (at about &pound;500 p.a.) was lower than that he had enjoyed as merchant. He had, however, made the effective transition from merchant to country gentleman, serving as justice of the peace for Northamptonshire from 1576, and as sheriff in 1581&#150;2.<br>
<br>Isham's last years were difficult. He refers in his will to losses by expensive litigation, dearth of cattle, and fire. His health was poor for the last twelve years or so of his life. According to his son's memoir he suffered from &#145;an issue of bloud running from his privy member&#146;  (Ramsay, 173&#150;4), which first manifested itself after a fall from his horse. He died at Lamport on 17 March 1596, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church two days later.<br>
<br>Isham was perhaps unusual in making the leap from mercantile to gentry status in one generation. He was determined that the estate should be transmitted intact to his eldest son, Thomas (1555&#150;1605), who was blind from at least the age of twelve. The settlement of the estate in 1588 had ensured this, but left the younger sons, Henry (1561&#150;1628) and Richard (1565&#150;1618), dependent on small annuities and cash bequests. John Isham died as the well-established squire of Lamport, but he had not forgotten whence his fortune came. In his will he requested that his gravestone should be embellished at the corners with four brass plates bearing the coats of arms of the City of London, the Merchant Adventurers' Company, the Mercers' Company, and the Ishams,<blockquote>with suche other armes, superscriptions, verses and posies &hellip; to testifie to posteritie of what house I discend bothe of my father and my mothers side, that I was a Merchaunt Adventurer of the Cittie of London and free of the Company of Mercers and by that meanes with the blessing of God received my preferrement and was enhabled to purchase the mannor of Langporte and patronage of the churche therof.</blockquote>There are few more powerful testimonies to the role of sixteenth-century London commerce as a social escalator.<br>
