<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Tate</span>  (1739&#150;1803), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 27 October 1739, the son of the Revd John Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1757) and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tate (<i>d</i>. 1763), the daughter of an alderman of Carlisle. His father was chaplain to the Savoy, chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, rector of Coyty in Glamorgan, and curate of Wise in Kent. Wilkinson's own life and the anecdotal sweep of his colourful stage career can be found recorded, in considerable detail, in the four volumes of his <span class="italic">Memoirs of his Own Life</span> (1790) and in the four volumes of <span class="italic">The Wandering Patentee, or, A History of the Yorkshire Theatres from 1770 to the Present Time</span> (1795).<br>
<br>Wilkinson's early education was provided by the schooling of a Mr Bellas in Church Lane, and later that of a Mr Tempest, near Wandsworth. He might have been expected to follow dutifully the example of his father and enter the church, but at the age of ten he became unexpectedly stage-struck. The theatre housekeeper of Covent Garden, a family acquaintance, allowed him privileged access to rehearsals and productions in what must have seemed to the young boy the most hallowed of secular surroundings. At the age of thirteen he was sent to Harrow School, where the zeal he now displayed for things theatrical found outlet in his skill at mimicry and in the performance of roles such as Lady Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span> and Romeo. When he was seventeen his father was sentenced to fourteen years' transportation to America for the illegal conduct of marriages by his own licence at the Savoy, and in March 1757 his father died when storms forced the convict ship to put in for shelter at Portsmouth. Although Wilkinson and his mother were close to destitution, the young man now surprised and offended Jonas Hanway, a close friend of his father, by spurning the security of an arranged commission in the army. Wilkinson, ambitious for a stage career, applied instead to John Rich, manager of Covent Garden Theatre, who offered him some instruction then promptly admonished him as being incapable of acting. The prospect of employment with Rich was further diminished by making an enemy of Covent Garden's renowned leading lady, Margaret Woffington. Believing she had heard Wilkinson mimic her one evening, Mrs Woffington had insisted on his dismissal. Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> capture the off-stage drama of the green room confrontation with Woffington:<blockquote>Mr Wilkinson, I have made a visit this morning to Mr Rich to command and to insist on his not giving you any engagement whatever&#151;no, not of the most menial kind in the theatre.&#151;Merit you have none&#151;charity you deserve not,&#151;for if you did my purse should give you a dinner &hellip; I heard you echo my voice when I was acting, and I sincerely hope in whatever barn you are acting as an unworthy stroller, that you will fully experience the same contempt you dared last night to offer me.</blockquote>Ned Shuter, a comic player and friend of Wilkinson's, invited him, however, to play a role, that of the Fine Gentleman, in Garrick's farce <span class="italic">Lethe</span>, staged for Shuter's benefit performance on 28 March 1757. Wilkinson was introduced &#145;as a person who had never appeared&#146;. On the second evening, playing the same role in a benefit for the actor James Bencraft, he was taunted and hissed off the stage. A few weeks later he was present as an onlooker in the wings when Woffington suffered the collapse and paralysis that was to end her career. He went to the assistance of the actress and later recorded the incident in his memoirs, recalling her kind words as he helped her from the stage.<br>
<br>With the help of aristocratic patrons, Wilkinson managed to gain an audience with David Garrick, the revered actor&#150;manager of Drury Lane. Garrick was so taken with his mimicry and impersonation of his rival Samuel Foote that he engaged him for Drury Lane's autumn season 1757&#150;8 at 30<i>s</i>. a week. At this same time Wilkinson also joined a company under the management of Wignall in Maidstone, Kent, opening as Aimwell in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>. He played other roles without much success and on appearing at Drury Lane under Garrick was given only walk-on parts. The unpredictable Garrick, now cold towards Wilkinson, encouraged him to leave for Ireland with Foote. Towards the end of 1757 he appeared with Foote at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, under Sheridan, playing the part of Puzzle in Foote's then popular entertainment <span class="italic">Tea</span>. The role gave Wilkinson scope for his imitations of contemporary performers, which proved a great success with Dublin audiences. The suggestion to Sheridan that he now add an imitation of the manager himself was, however, coldly received. Sheridan dismissed Wilkinson from the stage until his contracted benefit performance on 25 February 1758. The measure, though, of his popularity was in the considerable takings of 130 guineas. He returned to London, flushed with his Irish success, to find himself still denied acceptance by Garrick. With the help of influential friends he managed to find employment from 9 June to 14 August 1758 in Portsmouth, where the fleet was then stationed. With the Portsmouth company he extended his repertory with roles such as Romeo, Hotspur, Richard III, Lear, Hamlet, and Orestes.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's first appearance under Garrick at Drury Lane took place with Foote in October 1758 in Foote's two-act farce <span class="italic">Diversions of the Morning</span>. In the role of Bounce, Wilkinson again gave a range of imitations of well-known actors, to the delight of audiences. One of his victims, the actor Luke Sparks, complained to Garrick and demanded that the imitations be withdrawn. Garrick consented to this, but the reaction of the audience to the censorship of the imitations was so riotous that Garrick immediately capitulated. In an attempt to pacify feelings in the theatre community, Garrick submitted now to Wilkinson's additional impersonation of Garrick himself. Garrick's outrage was softened, however, by the obvious success at the box office. At the close of the season in May 1759, for his benefit performance, Wilkinson played his imitation of Foote, and also acted Othello, to a crowded, distinguished, and appreciative audience.<br>
<br>Wilkinson continued to enjoy theatrical success in Dublin and Winchester. In November 1760 he made his first appearance at Covent Garden in Foote's <span class="italic">The Minor</span>, a satirical comedy which made fun of Sheridan's schemes to set up an academy and which played in direct competition with Foote's own production at Drury Lane. As well as parodying Foote's style of playing, Wilkinson also imitated Garrick to such effect that Garrick never again spoke to him.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's fame was now spreading, and for three years, from 1762 onwards, he lived a peripatetic life with appearances at Birmingham, Bath, Chester, London, Portsmouth, and Bristol. He also played for the first time at Norwich and York, and in February 1765 in Edinburgh, once again performing in <span class="italic">The Minor</span>. In York he had come into contact with Joseph Baker, the owner and manager of a newly built and unlicensed theatre, who had once been an actor as well as a painter of church interiors and theatrical scenery. This relationship proved to be one of the most significant in Wilkinson's life. Baker's warmth and affection towards him was such that he came to feel like an adopted son. Baker was heavily in debt, partly due to investment in a new theatre, when it was suggested that he consider taking on Wilkinson as a business partner. At the age of twenty-six, Wilkinson joined Baker's enterprise, eventually investing some &pound;1400, attending to refurbishment, reordering costumes with richer fabrics, and generally improving the theatrical stock. He also developed an ethical approach to the employment and working practice of the acting profession, introducing much needed reforms such as an end to the custom of actors knocking on doors to solicit for their benefit performances.<br>
<br>On 11 October 1768 Wilkinson married Jane Doughty in York, and in August 1769 the first of their seven children was born. Baker died in 1770, leaving Wilkinson sole manager of the York circuit, a mixture of Yorkshire-based theatre buildings, including, additionally, those of Hull and Newcastle. Wilkinson abandoned Newcastle a year or two later but built and opened, at considerable expense, a new theatre in Leeds in 1774. Company performances were given in the race week at Doncaster and, at other times, in Beverley, Halifax, Pontefract, Sheffield, and Wakefield. But managerial responsibilities did nothing to diminish Wilkinson's appetite for acting. He continued to make visits and appearances in Dublin, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Norwich, and elsewhere. In January 1778 he returned to Covent Garden at the invitation of Mr Harris, his friend and manager of the theatre:<blockquote>This journey with others, was the occasion of my adopting the title of the WANDERING PATENTEE, as from my quitting my Yorkshire home to trip to Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other places, occasioned Mr Woodfall's whimsically favouring me with that appellation. (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">The Wandering Patentee</span>, 278)</blockquote>In 1780 Wilkinson took an additional responsibility for the management of the Edinburgh theatre, resulting in his command now of three patent theatres, his royal trio of York, Hull, and Edinburgh. In 1788 he broke his leg and suffered feverishly for many months. Although he continued to move around the circuit in pursuit of his duties, sometimes carried in a litter, his more active and juvenile roles had now to be abandoned and visits to fellow managers limited. A bad attack of gout in 1792 signalled deteriorating health. By the mid-1790s he was quite worn down with the stress of management and excessive travel, and he made use of the enforced rest to pursue his writing and reminiscences for <span class="italic">The Wandering Patentee</span>. He also contributed a series of articles, with lively anecdotes of actors, to the theatrical periodical the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>. None of this, after such an active and varied life, could quite prevent the tendency to bouts of depression in his final years.<br>
<br>Wilkinson still acted on occasion until 1801 and continued to control the affairs of his northern circuit until his death, in York, on 25 August 1803. He was buried shortly afterwards at All Saints' Church, York. (His monument inscription remains at All Saints' Pavement.) He left five surviving children, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38587/', "John Joseph Tate Wilkinson")</script>, like himself an actor, succeeded him in the management of the York circuit. Little exists by way of critical commentary on Wilkinson's achievements as an actor. His reputation was founded on enormous popularity as a gifted mimic of exceptional skill and ability. He caught the very appearance of the people he imitated, even if they were young women. His friend Stephen Kemble once called him &#145;the ugliest man he ever saw&#146;. George Anne Bellamy, however, described him as &#145;tall, his countenance rather sportive than beautiful, and his manners agreeable&#146;. In retrospect it may be Wilkinson's remarkable thirty-seven years' tenure as a theatrical manager that stand as his most formidable achievement. As Highfill points out: &#145;Few indeed were the British actors of the latter half of the century who were not at some point in their careers beneficiaries of the alternate cosseting and scolding of &#147;the wandering patentee&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">BDA</span>). In his lifetime, Wilkinson came to be admired and respected for his probity and his fairness in the conduct of a profession that had long endured fraudulent practice, exploitation, and desperate insecurity.<br>
