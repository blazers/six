<span class="headword">Bradbrook,  Muriel Clara</span>  (1909&#150;1993), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 27 April 1909 in Glasgow, the eldest child of Samuel Bradbrook (<i>d</i>. 1928) and his wife, Annie Wilson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harvey (<i>b</i>. 1872). Samuel Bradbrook was superintendent of HM water guard, first at Glasgow and then at Liverpool. Muriel Bradbrook was educated at Hutchesons' Girls' Grammar School, Glasgow, and at Oldershaw School, Wallasey, from where she proceeded to Girton College, Cambridge. She graduated with a double first in English in 1930 and was Ottilie Hancock research fellow at the college from 1932 to 1935. In 1935 she was made an official fellow.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Bradbrook worked in London for the Board of Trade, and returned to Cambridge as university lecturer in 1945. Even before that she had already published five books of literary criticism: <span class="italic">Elizabethan Stage Conditions</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Themes and Conventions of Elizabethan Tragedy</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The School of Night: Study of the Literary Relationships of Sir Walter Ralegh</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Andrew Marvell</span> (1940), written in collaboration with Gwyneth Lloyd Thomas, and <span class="italic">Joseph Conrad: Poland's English Genius</span> (1941). While busy in London with her war work she managed to write one more book, <span class="italic">Ibsen the Norwegian: a Revaluation</span>, published in 1946. Having learned Dano-Norwegian so as to be able to read Ibsen's early work in the original, Bradbrook placed great emphasis on the poetic power of his language. She devotes a chapter to some of his more significant lyrical poems and links the themes of several of them with particular aspects of some of the plays written later. In the preface she wrote, &#145;The book was written during the intervals of war work in London, where many of Ibsen's countrymen shared the night watches with me, and on one occasion rescued me and my manuscript from the debris of a flying bomb.&#146; This book, and two or three others of hers, are telling testimonies to the breadth of her range. There is, for example, an excellent commentary on Beckett's <span class="italic">En attendant Godot</span> in chapter 1 of <span class="italic">Literature in Action</span> (1972). Although a specialist in Elizabethan and Jacobean literature (especially dramatic literature), Bradbrook saw poetry, from Aeschylus to Beckett, as being all of a piece, the finest and truest expression of the human spirit.<br>
<br>Bradbrook was one of the earliest of twentieth-century critics to begin the rehabilitation of Elizabethan drama <i>as drama</i>, that is to say to undertake the task of restoring it, whole and undiluted, to the theatre. She was herself an avid theatregoer, trenchantly critical of productions that did less than justice to the text but quick and eager to praise moments of truth perceived and visual poetry realized. Often, both in her writing and in her lectures, she expressed her disapproval of the nineteenth-century tendency to regard Shakespeare as &#145;mere literature&#146;: even the great A. C. Bradley comes under her lash in this regard. The essay for which she won the Harness prize was the basis of her first book: <span class="italic">Elizabethan Stage Conditions</span> (1932). For the second edition in 1962 she wrote a brief prefatory note:<blockquote>Some sentences in this essay may sound less than just to that great Shakespearean, Harley Granville Barker. When as a youthful student I wrote them, I knew that Granville Barker was one of the adjudicators for the Harness Prize, and was determined not to curry favour. So I slapped the examiner. I have not forgotten his genial kindness then and would like to say now how much I have always admired his work.</blockquote>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Bradbrook's work on Shakespeare and the Elizabethans continued to be greeted with superlatives by the best critics of the day: &#145;The sanest and most stimulating book about Shakespeare to have appeared since the war&#146;, said Kenneth Muir about <span class="italic">Shakespeare and Elizabethan Poetry</span> (1951); Frank Kermode, in 1962, described <span class="italic">The Rise of the Common Player</span>, published in that year, as &#145;A highly original book, which constantly illuminates the drama of the period &hellip; A rich, rewarding book&#146;. And James Reeves said the same book &#145;has the merit of integrating literary history with sociology, instead of separating it off in the manner of earlier writers on the theatre&#146;.<br>
<br>The University of Cambridge appointed Bradbrook reader in 1962 and professor of English in 1965 (the English faculty's first woman professor). In 1968 she was appointed mistress of Girton. At various times during her career she held visiting professorships at Santa Cruz (California), Kuwait, Seoul, Tokyo, Kenyon College (Ohio), and Rhodes University, South Africa. Reputed to have been tentative, and even somewhat disorganized and vague in everyday matters in her early days at Girton, when she became chairman of the English faculty she very quickly established a reputation for vigorous action and firm decision (with, perhaps, just a touch of the authoritarian). Her clashes with Dr George Steiner, for instance, are still part of Cambridge folklore. But her capacity for clarity of vision, imaginative planning, and sheer hard work was never anywhere in question.<br>
<br>At the personal level Bradbrook was kind, patient, generous to a fault, and quite without any arrogance or pretentiousness. Her judgement was shrewd without being shrewish, her conversation witty without being facetious. To dozens of her professional colleagues and scores of her former students she was affectionately known as Brad; to her many friends outside her immediate Cambridge circle she was Mollie, though she always wrote as M. C. Bradbrook. In 1969 she had written a history of Girton under the ironic title, <span class="italic">The Infidel Place</span>. Girton was, in a very special sense, her second home, the centre of her life and of her remarkable career. She never married. She retired in 1976 and was recognized by Girton as a life fellow.<br>
<br>In all Bradbrook wrote some seventeen books, several quite brilliant and none negligible. She died at her home, 91 Chesterton Road, Cambridge, on 11 June 1993, and was cremated in Cambridge on 22 June. She left an estate of &pound;705,250, much of it bequeathed in trust for her brother Samuel J. Bradbrook for life, but reverting absolutely to Girton College on his death.<br>
