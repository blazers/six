<span class="headword">Thornton,  Samuel</span>  (1754&#150;1838), <span class="occ">merchant and bank governor</span>, was born on 6 November 1754, the eldest son in the family of three sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27358/', "John Thornton (1720&#150;1790)")</script>, a merchant, of Hull and Clapham, and his wife, Lucy, the daughter of Samuel Watson, a Russia merchant of Hull. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27357/', "Henry Thornton (1760&#150;1815)")</script>, philanthropist and economist, was his younger brother. Samuel married on 12 December 1780 Elizabeth, the only daughter of Robert Milnes, of Fryston Hall, in Yorkshire; they had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1790, worth about &pound;600,000, Samuel Thornton succeeded him as head of the family business in Hull, which was engaged in trade with the Baltic countries. He was appointed a director of the Bank of England in 1780, a post he held for fifty-three years, serving as deputy governor between 1797 and 1799 and governor from 1799 until 1801. He became an assistant of the Russia Company in 1778 and governor from 1810 until his death. He was also an assistant of the Eastland Company from 1795 and deputy governor from 1810 until his death.<br>
<br>In March 1784 Thornton was returned as a tory member of parliament for Hull, together with his cousin William Wilberforce. He held this seat until 1806. In May 1807 he was returned for Surrey, where he had bought an estate at Albury in 1800, defeating Lord William Russell, who had held the constituency in five parliaments. Thornton himself was defeated at the general election in 1812, but was returned at a by-election in the following year. He was defeated in 1818, and then decided to retire from public life.<br>
<br>In the House of Commons Thornton was an informed, and often influential, speaker on commercial and business affairs, especially when they related to the Bank of England. He took, for example, a leading part in the debates on the <span class="roman">Bank Restriction Bill</span> of 1797, a bill which, when eventually passed, authorized the suspension of cash payments. He usually, although not always, supported William Pitt, and privately approved of Pitt's proposed income tax as beneficial to the state. He defended the policy of the bank when it issued exchequer bills during the commercial crisis of April 1793.<br>
<br>As governor, Thornton moved the renewal of the bank's charter in 1800, some twelve years before it expired&#151;part of measures adopted to prevent the founding of a rival institution&#151;saying that the banknotes issued by the bank were both valid and adequate. He opposed the resumption of cash payments in 1811, but insisted in 1815 that the bank was anxious to resume cash payments as soon as possible. As late as 1818, however, in his last important speech before his retirement, Thornton said that such a step would be dangerous, in view of the number of foreign loans and a recent run of bad harvests. He defended on numerous occasions the steps taken by the bank to prevent the forgery of its notes.<br>
<br>Although widely regarded as a member of the Clapham Sect, Thornton did not wholeheartedly maintain all of its views. He supported Wilberforce's campaign against the slave trade, was in favour of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, and opposed public lotteries. He voted in favour of Catholic relief in 1816 and again in 1817. In 1796 he supported plans for a wet dock in London, citing the example of the new schemes at Hull, which at first were unpopular, but in 1802 he came top of the poll at Hull, where the dock schemes were proving successful. He was both surprised and offended to lose his seat there in 1806.<br>
<br>By about 1810 Thornton was experiencing financial difficulties. The failure of the business firm of Watson of Preston cost his own firm &pound;50,000, and the depressed state of the trade with the Baltic brought the London branch of his firm to a temporary halt in 1810. He sold his Albury estate in 1811 for &pound;72,000.<br>
<br>Thornton was a governor of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and president of Guy's Hospital, and in 1798 became lieutenant-colonel of the Clapham Volunteers. He died at his house in Brighton on 3 July 1838.<br>
<br>His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_27359"></a><span class="headword">John Thornton</span>  (1783&#150;1861)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 31 October 1783. He graduated BA at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1804 and MA in 1809. In 1807 he married Eliza, the daughter of Edward Parry; they had six sons and four daughters. She published <span class="italic">Lady Alice: a Ballad Romance</span>, in 1842, <span class="italic">The Marchioness, a Tale</span>, in the same year, and a third novel, <span class="italic">Truth and Falsehood, a Romance</span>, in 1847. John Thornton became successively commissioner of the boards of audit, stamps, and inland revenue, as well as treasurer of the Church Missionary Society and of the Bible Society. He died at Clapham on 29 October 1861.<br>
