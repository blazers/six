<span class="headword">Hunt,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1696), <span class="occ">author</span>, published <span class="italic">Demonstration of astrology, or, A brief discourse, proving the influence of the sun, moon, and stars, over this terraqueous globe</span> (1696), in which he describes himself as &#145;a Lover of the Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy&#146;  (Hunt, title-page). As the preface was written in Alconbury, Essex, he may have lived there at the time. The work was dedicated to Charles, Viscount Mandevill and earl of Manchester, with thanks for his support. Otherwise, biographical details of Hunt are conjectural. Since it seems probable that he had a university education, he may have been the William Hunt, born the son of William Hunt at Sutton, Cambridgeshire, who attended a private school there and matriculated from Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 7 August 1674, aged nineteen, and who probably graduated LLB from Trinity Hall in 1679. This man's father may be identified as the Oxford-educated clergyman William Hunt who was ejected from his living at Sutton in 1662, but who remained there as a schoolmaster and was licensed as a presbyterian minister in 1672; his two sons, William and John, entered the ministry. A William Hunt of Little Beddow, Essex, &#145;minister of the gospell&#146;, drew up his will on 2 March 1698, mentioning his two brothers, Edward and John, also &#145;minister of the gospell&#146;, two daughters from his first marriage to &#145;E. T.&#146;, and a son, John. The executor was his (second) wife, Abigail, and the overseers included Francis Barrington, esquire. The will was proved on 19 April the same year.<br>
<br>Hunt's treatise was part of a general movement at the time among the better-educated astrologers to rescue the subject from its parlous state, which he described as &#145;now so sullied over with Innovations and Superstitions, that it's hard to find the Truth from the Falsehood&#146;  (Hunt, v&#150;vi). As a result, there were left &#145;but few students or lovers of this art&#146;  (ibid., A3). Other tracts from this period with the same aim (if not always the same means) include John Goad's <span class="italic">Astro-Meteorologica</span> (1686), John Partridge's <span class="italic">Opus reformatum</span> (1693) and <span class="italic">Defectio geniturarum</span> (1697), and Robert Godson's <span class="italic">Astrologia reformata</span> (1697). Hunt claimed that &#145;I through my diligent Study and Observation have gained more select Arcana's than ever were known to the late (tho Learned) Dr. Goad&#146;  (ibid., iv) and, like Goad, he sought to rectify the disrepute into which partisan and sectarian astrologers had brought their subject by concentrating upon &#145;chiefly this most useful and innocent Part, the Knowledg of the Weather&#146;  (ibid., A2).<br>
<br>Hunt's particular contribution was his claim to ground astrology &#145;on the Fundamental Rules of the Copernican System and Philosophy. &hellip; Whereby the Art is rendered almost Mathematically Demonstrable&#146;  (Hunt, title). It was not original, however; Joshua Childrey's <span class="italic">Indago astrologica</span> (1652) and Vincent Wing's <span class="italic">Harmonicon coeleste</span> (1651) had both attempted to give astrology a new footing in the heliocentric cosmos. The &#145;almost&#146; of his title gives away the enormous gap between Hunt's ambition&#151;which is what it might have taken actually to re-establish astrology as a reputable subject&#151;and his accomplishment. So too does his appendix, &#145;treating of this Summer's Effects. &hellip; Wherein we have great cause to fear, that the Sword, Pestilence, and Famine, will annoy our European Territories this ensuing Summer&#146;: just the kind of prognostication that had brought astrology into lasting disfavour among the intellectual, religious, and political &eacute;lites of the day.<br>
