<span class="headword">Waldegrave,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1603/4), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was the son of Richard Waldegrave, yeoman, of Blackley, Worcestershire. He was apprenticed to William Griffith, stationer, of London, for eight years, starting on 24 June 1568, by which date his father was dead. Waldegrave would have gained his freedom by 1576, a year for which the Stationers' Company records have been lost, but the first record of him as a licensee occurs on 17 June 1578, when he was licensed to publish a book of prayers, <span class="italic">The Castle for the Soule</span>, printed for him by Thomas Dawson in the same year. This first licence was a taste of what was to come during a long career of printing and publishing religious and theological texts.<br>
<br>Waldegrave printed in London for ten years, mostly at premises &#145;Without Temple Bar in the Strand&#146;, near Somerset House, although in 1583 he was briefly located at Foster Lane and in the late 1580s occasionally published at The Crane in St Paul's Churchyard. His device was a swan within an oval medallion. Although printing overtly until 1588, he quickly gained a reputation as a printer of puritan material. Books by dissenting English clergymen, such as Dudley Fenner, Laurence Chaderton, and the leading presbyterian John Field were printed by Waldegrave, as were editions of Luther, Calvin, and Knox. According to later anonymous tracts printed by Waldegrave, he was imprisoned twice in the 1580s in the White Lion prison at Southwark, the longest spell being one of twenty weeks in 1586&#150;7 (a date sometimes confused with autumn 1588 when he was clearly at liberty). In fact there is no supporting evidence for the longer imprisonment, and it must be remembered that Waldegrave had a taste for dramatic propaganda. None the less he was despised and pursued by the episcopacy in England, and Thomas Cooper, bishop of Winchester, described him as &#145;a notorious disobedient and godelesse person&#146;  (Cooper, 41). Clerical influence in Star Chamber secured a decree in February 1588 aimed at ending his press activity. On 16 April the officers of the Stationers' Company entered his premises and confiscated his press and most, though not all, of his type, along with anonymous copies of John Udall's <span class="italic">The State of the Churche of England Laid Open &hellip;</span> (otherwise known as <span class="italic">Diotrephes</span>), a tract extremely offensive to the bishops. A month later the books were burnt and his printing materials destroyed, but Waldegrave himself retreated underground and avoided arrest.<br>
<br>Even before these events Waldegrave had decided to begin covert printing activity and he received encouragement from the puritan John Penry. In May&#150;June 1588 Waldegrave and Penry took sanctuary at the East Molesey home of Mrs Elizabeth Crane, the widow of Anthony Crane, master of the queen's household, conveniently sited near John Udall's parish in Kingston upon Thames. There Waldegrave printed anonymously some tracts by Penry and Udall and also in October the first mocking pamphlet under the pseudonym <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73908/', "Martin Marprelate")</script>, Penry's <span class="italic">Oh Read over D. John Bridges</span> (known as <span class="italic">The Epistle</span>). As the officers of the Stationers' Company began searching the area, in November Waldegrave, his family, and materials moved to Northamptonshire and to the home of the puritan supporter Sir Richard Knightley at Fawsley. There Waldegrave disguised himself as Knightley's clerk and printed <span class="italic">The Epitome</span>. However, to keep ahead of the authorities, at the turn of the year the press was again on the move, this time to the house of another sympathetic patron, John Hales of Coventry. There in March 1589 Waldegrave's last Marprelate tract <span class="italic">Hay any Worke for Cooper</span> was printed, and it reveals much bitterness at his treatment by the authorities. Then, either out of fear of arrest or because he tired of tactics now disowned by some puritans, Waldegrave abandoned Marprelate activity in spring 1589, leaving it to some lesser printers who would not be so lucky in avoiding authority. Subsequently Waldegrave is known to have arrived in Scotland by the spring of 1590, but the intervening period is something of a mystery. He may have gone briefly to Devon and more likely on to La Rochelle in France, where he may have printed books by Penry and Job Throckmorton. Penry himself reported Waldegrave in La Rochelle in May 1589. The fact that puritan activists at this time tended to leave false trails to protect themselves from arrest makes it difficult to be certain of his movements. None the less the fact that Waldegrave was awarded a printing licence in Edinburgh in March 1590 confirms that he was by then in Scotland.<br>
<br>Long before he arrived in Scotland Waldegrave had direct and indirect contacts with that country. Both Penry and Udall had strong Scottish associations, Penry joining Waldegrave in Scottish exile in 1589. Moreover Waldegrave had earlier printed for the Scottish reformed church, including Knox's confession of faith in 1581. When he came to Scotland he was welcomed as the first printer of the puritan <span class="italic">Booke of the Forme of Common Prayer</span> (1584&#150;5), a book banned by the English Star Chamber. But Waldegrave impressed James VI as well as the kirk, and on 9 October 1590 he was appointed to the vacant position of king's printer and came under royal protection. Over the next thirteen years, at an undiscovered Edinburgh address, he printed over 100 works, making him the most prolific Scottish printer of the sixteenth century. His &#145;puritan&#146; output did not cease overnight and he produced two anonymous editions by Penry (1590) and openly printed the works of committed Scottish presbyterians like John Davidson and James Melville. As well as the writings of puritans and presbyterians, Waldegrave published William Welwood's <span class="italic">The Sea-Law of Scotland</span> (1590), the earliest British book of maritime jurisprudence, John Napier's popular millenarian work <span class="italic">A Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of Saint John</span> (1593), and much else. His press is best known, however, as the mouthpiece of the major works of King James: his <span class="italic">Poetical Exercises</span> (1591), <span class="italic">Daemonologie</span> (1597, reprinted 1600), <span class="italic">The Trew Law</span> (1598), and <span class="italic">Basilikon doron</span> (1599, reprinted 1603).<br>
<br>Waldegrave's &#145;pirated editions&#146;, such as Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span> (1599), were not pirates in the Scottish market. Nevertheless, these editions were resented by the Stationers' Company, just as his Edinburgh-produced puritan tracts were by the English government. Both types of production were subject to confiscation when they crossed into England. In general Waldegrave introduced a measure of Anglicization to the Scottish press, both in language and manners, such as the greater incidence of printed dedications. He suffered little government interference in Scotland, though King James was angered by some of Davidson's views. None the less, in February 1597 Waldegrave was charged with &#145;tressonabill imprenting&#146; an act of parliament  (Pitcairn, 2.2). He was, indeed, the only Scottish printer to be tried for treason. Waldegrave's crime was to print, without permission, a version of the so-called <span class="roman">Golden Acts</span> of 1592 authorizing presbyterianism, and in a form too embarrassing for the increasingly Erastian regime of 1597. He was found guilty by the high court of justiciary, but the charge was set aside when it was found that a clerk of register had furnished him with the act.<br>
<br>Leaving his wife to continue printing in Edinburgh, in 1603 Waldegrave followed King James to London. This was a return he had hoped for during all his years in Scotland, but it was to be brief. He obtained a licence with the Stationers' Company in June that year, but had died by February 1604. The following month his widow sold certain of his Scottish printing privileges to Thomas Finlason, who also took possession of Waldegrave's printing materials. His office of royal printer, held for life only, reverted to the crown. In spite of generalized information conveyed by the Marprelate pamphlets very little is known in detail about his family. Presumably he married his wife Mary <i>c</i>.1580, as they had six children before they came to Scotland. A seventh child, Robert, was born in Edinburgh in September 1596. No will and testament has survived and his place of burial is unknown.<br>
