<span class="headword">Wagstaffe,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1633&#150;1677), <span class="occ">writer on witchcraft</span>, was born in Cheapside, London, the son of John Wagstaffe of London; his mother's name may have been Elizabeth. He was educated at St Paul's School and went up to Oriel College, Oxford, as a Pauline exhibitioner in 1649; he matriculated in 1650, graduated BA in 1653, and proceeded MA in 1656. In 1660 he contributed a Greek poem and a Latin acrostic to the volume of verses published at Oxford to celebrate the Restoration. He incorporated at Cambridge in 1668. On the death of an uncle, who died without male children, Wagstaffe inherited his estate at Hasland, Derbyshire; he never married.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe's first book, entitled <span class="italic">Historical reflections on the bishop of Rome, chiefly discovering those events of humane affaires which most advanced the papal usurpation</span>, published in 1660, gave a rather cynical account of the means by which papal hegemony was achieved at the expense of the susceptible barbarians in the early middle ages. His most famous work was his <span class="italic">The Question of Witchcraft Debated</span> (1669; 2nd edn, 1671). This offered a robust critique of the belief in witchcraft, appealing to reason and invoking sarcasm to make his case that the power of witches was illusory. The thrust of his case was threefold: &#145;1. That the opinion of Witchcraft is not to be found in Scripture. 2. That Politique interest hath founded it on fables. 3. That those fables discover themselves to be so, by their impossibility&#146;  (pp. 144&#150;5). Echoing the theme of his earlier <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, he took the view that witch beliefs had been consciously embroidered by the clergy as a means of self-aggrandizement; in his view such priestly manipulation capitalized on the fact that &#145;all men have fear implanted in them by nature, the very strongest of all their passions&#146;  (p. 125), a notion almost certainly derived from Hobbes. In making his case he took a confident and iconoclastic line, appealing to &#145;any sober unbiased person; especially if he be of such ingenuity, as to have freed himself from a slavish subjection, unto those prejudicial opinions, which Custome and education, do with too much Tyranny impose&#146;  (p. 147). Moreover, alluding to the empirical evidence by which such store was set by contemporary defenders of witch beliefs like Joseph Glanvill, he argued: &#145;it is far more easie, and far more rational to believe, that witnesses are lyars and perjured persons, than it is to believe; that an old Woman can turn her self, or any body else into a Cat&#146;  (p. 146).<br>
<br>Wagstaffe's book was attacked by one R. T. in a book entitled <span class="italic">The Opinion of Witchcraft Vindicated</span> (1670), and by the veteran scholar Meric Casaubon in his <span class="italic">Of Credulity and Incredulity; in Things Divine &amp; Spiritual</span> (1670), both of whom asserted a more traditional view of the subject. The result was that in 1671 Wagstaffe brought out a greatly extended second edition of his book. In it he elaborated his case and, in his preface, defended himself against the &#145;ridiculous slander&#146; that he was an &#145;atheist&#146;  (sig. A2), which evidently owed much to contemporary anxieties about the corrolaries of sadducism&#151;scepticism about witchcraft&#151;though it is also understandable in the light of Wagstaffe's iconoclasm and his somewhat deistic religious views.<br>
<br>The importance of Wagstaffe's work as one of the very few open attacks on witch beliefs in its period is illustrated by the fact that it was twice reprinted in the early eighteenth century, first in 1712 as part of the controversy over the conviction as a witch and subsequent pardoning of Jane Wenham and then in 1736 in connection with the repeal of the <span class="roman">Witchcraft Act</span>; in each case it provided the sole exposition of a strongly sceptical viewpoint. It was also translated into German in 1711.<br>
<br>Apart from the notoriety associated with this book, relatively little is known about Wagstaffe's life. A few personal details come from Anthony Wood, who notes that he was &#145;a little crooked man, and of a despicable presence&#146;; indeed, he looked &#145;like a little wizard&#146;, and his book on witchcraft accordingly caused mirth among the wits at Oxford. He died, according to Wood, aged forty-four or thereabouts, in London at his lodgings in Holborn, opposite Chancery Lane, on 2 September 1677, &#145;in a manner distracted, occasion'd by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a continual bibbing of strong and high tasted liquors&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1114). He was buried in the Guildhall chapel, City of London.<br>
