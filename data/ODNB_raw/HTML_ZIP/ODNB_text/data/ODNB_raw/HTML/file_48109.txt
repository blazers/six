<span class="headword">Platt family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1815&#150;1930), <span class="occ">textile machinery manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_57877"></a><span class="headword">Henry Platt</span>  (1793&#150;1842)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 20 March 1793 in the Pennine village of Dobcross, the son of John Platt (1767&#150;1830). On 20 March 1815 Henry married Sarah Whitehead (1792&#150;1860) and they raised four sons and six daughters. He took over the business of his father, a prosperous machine maker, and carried on the manufacture of wool-processing machinery. In 1821 he moved from Dobcross to the rapidly expanding cotton town of Oldham and there he began to manufacture cotton machinery, especially carding engines, in order to meet the rising demand for preparing the cotton. In 1822 he formed a partnership with the wealthy Elijah Hibbert (1801&#150;1846), under the name of Hibbert and Platt. The business prospered and they opened Hartford works at Greenacres Moor in 1829&#150;30.<br>
<br>Henry's son <a name="cosubject_37856"></a><span class="headword">John Platt</span>  (1817&#150;1872)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 15 September 1817, learned the ironmoulder's trade, and was admitted to the partnership in 1837. On 9 March 1842 he married Alice Radcliffe (1823&#150;1902), daughter of Samuel Radcliffe (1780&#150;1838) of Lower House, who had been Oldham's leading cotton manufacturer. John Platt became the senior partner in the firm after the successive deaths of his father in 1842, of his elder brother Joseph (1815&#150;1845), and of Elijah Hibbert in 1846. He became a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange in 1842 and so secured admission to the world's largest assembly of users of cotton machinery. His mechanical ability became apparent in his first patent, taken out in 1846. He proved to be a man of great business faculty, of broad and far-reaching perception, and of astute judgement, especially of character. He became the prime mover in the operations of the firm at the most propitious of times, when statutory restrictions on the export of machinery were abolished in 1843. His achievement was to establish the supremacy of the firm in the newly opened markets of Europe. During the late 1840s Hibbert and Platt surpassed Dobson and Barlow of Bolton in size to become the largest textile machinery firm in Lancashire as well as the largest employer of labour in Oldham. During the 1850s it became the largest machinery maker in the world. The firm supplied the domestic market as well as the export trade, especially the mills of Oldham, whose spindleage expanded sixfold in thirty years (1842&#150;72) to establish its pre-eminence as the largest mill town in the world. Oldham lay on the Pennine frontier of Lancashire and had few intrinsic advantages for the development of manufacturing industry. John Platt supplied ample compensation for its shortcomings and provided its mills with an external economy of unrivalled efficiency. If any one man may be credited with founding the industrial power and commercial prosperity of Oldham then it should be John Platt, under whose dynamic aegis the town established its world primacy in the two staple trades of cotton spinning and engineering. The number of hands employed by the firm increased twelvefold in thirty years, from 500 in 1843 to approximately 7000 in 1872. By 1871 its payroll supported over 40 per cent of the borough's population of 82,619, assuming an average household size of five persons.<br>
<br>John Platt secured the invaluable support of his younger brother James Platt (1824&#150;1857), who possessed supreme engineering and marketing ability and who in 1857 became the first engineer to be elected to the House of Commons. They expanded capacity at the Greenacres works to meet the growing demand and then in 1845 they opened the Hartford new works at Oldham's new railhead, where they adopted the use of machine tools as well as the railway. John Platt moved his own residence to nearby Werneth Park in 1848. The increased use of machine tools aroused opposition among the operative engineers. John Platt organized the Central Association of Employers of Operative Engineers and defeated the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in a four-month lock-out in 1852. Thereafter he developed the use of self-acting tools to the fullest extent, so economizing on the use of skilled labour. He favoured the restriction of union functions to the payment of benefits and the extension of the franchise, coupled with the secret ballot, in order to free operatives from the influence of &#145;turbulent and unscrupulous&#146; union leaders  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 1871, col. 613).<br>
<br>The brothers bought out the Hibbert interest in the firm in 1854 and renamed it Platt Bros. &amp; Co., the style by which it was henceforth known. They recruited men of outstanding technical and managerial ability, promoted them to the rank of manager and, from 1854, admitted them as partners. Their new policy generated an unrivalled <i>esprit de corps</i> and prevented the firm from becoming a recruiting ground for rivals. The brothers had in effect subordinated the interests of the Platt family to the higher interests of the firm. Together they transformed the firm from an assembler of parts into a fully integrated engineering enterprise. The firm established control over its supply of raw materials by adding a foundry in 1854 and a forge in 1857 and by undertaking the manufacture of rollers, spindles, flyers, and tin-plate as well as, from 1859, brick-making machinery. During the boom of the 1850s in power-loom weaving it added, in 1857, looms to its range of machines. Thereby it became the only firm able to offer clients a full line of machinery, excluding only flax-processing and finishing machinery. In order to maintain its reputation in foreign markets the firm manufactured machinery of the highest quality, undertook the continuous improvement of its staple lines, used iron instead of wood in construction, maintained close ties with the steam engine makers of Bolton, and supplied an after-sales service through the dispatch abroad of skilled machine erectors. Above all, it employed enterprising foreign agents, especially Adolphus Sington (1810&#150;1887) and Ludwig Knoop (1821&#150;1894), known as &#145;the Arkwright of Russia&#146;. It captured the Russian market after 1843, the Indian market after 1854, and the Japanese market after 1867. After a sensational success at the Great Exhibition in 1851 it used international exhibitions as an important technique of marketing, winning an unparalleled series of thirty-three exhibition honours between 1851 and 1924.<br>
<br>John Platt responded effectively to the challenge created by the cotton famine, becoming a member of the Central Executive Committee in 1862. He helped to found the Manchester Cotton Company Ltd (1860&#150;64) in order to develop the supply of cotton from India. His works embarked on the manufacture of cotton gins adapted to the short Indian staple and adapted the industry's preparatory machinery to the use of short stapled Surat. He encouraged the mills of Oldham to replace American by Indian cotton and so to steal a march on other mill towns. He endowed the town with the most advanced system of technical education in the region outside of Manchester. He established a works library in 1848, a new science and art school in 1865, and a works school in 1866, making attendance compulsory as a condition of employment. In 1859 he became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and in 1866 contributed to its proceedings its first paper on cotton spinning machinery. In 1861 he became a fellow of the Society of Arts and a guarantor of the International Exhibition of 1862, aiming to encourage the use of Indian cotton. He served as president of the Oldham Lyceum from 1865 to 1868 and helped in 1868 to endow a chair of engineering in Owens College. The incorporation of the company in 1868, with a capital of &pound;912,306, enabled him to make his managers into fellow directors and gave the engineering industry its first limited company. Under his management the firm made average annual profits of 13.7 per cent between 1842 and 1872.<br>
<br>John Platt became as active in the political sphere as in the economic. He became chairman of the Oldham Liberal Party in 1847 and so embarked on twenty-five years of public service. He was the prime mover in securing the incorporation of Oldham as a borough in 1849. He became the first of the Platts to serve on the borough council (1849&#150;62) and the first Liberal mayor, holding that high office for three terms (1854&#150;5, 1855&#150;6, 1861&#150;2) and ushering in forty years of Liberal control of the council. He established municipal control over the supply of gas and water and was mainly responsible for the construction between 1856 and 1863 of rail links to Oldham, serving from 1862 to 1867 as a director of the London and North Western Railway Company. A convinced radical in politics, he served as MP for Oldham from 1865 until his death. In 1871 he was publicly commended for twenty-five years of civic service in an address signed by 8000 working men, assembled in the Co-operative Hall. He had become a member of the Anti-Corn Law League in 1843 and he remained a lifelong advocate of free trade, helping Richard Cobden to negotiate the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1860.<br>
<br>In religion John Platt abandoned the Congregational faith of his fathers and became an Anglican, perhaps on the occasion of his marriage in 1842. He remained, however, an Anglican of the radical variety, favouring disestablishment and even disendowment. In 1857 he acquired a country estate at Bryn-y-Neuadd, Llanfairfechan, which he transformed from a hamlet into a summer resort and endowed with a railway station in 1861 as well as a church in 1864, adding the much larger neighbouring estate of Gorddinog in 1869. He became a JP and deputy lieutenant of Caernarvonshire and in 1863 high sheriff as well as JP and deputy lieutenant of Lancashire. On 18 May 1872 he died suddenly from typhoid in Paris at the age of fifty-four. The funeral was attended by 20,000 people and by 21 clergy. In 1878 a bronze memorial was inaugurated outside the town hall, giving Oldham its second public statue. His estate was valued at under &pound;800,000, where his father in 1842 had left under &pound;10,000, Elijah Hibbert under &pound;30,000, and his brother James &pound;137,589. In thirty years of marriage his wife had given birth to six daughters and seven sons.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48109"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Radcliffe Platt</span>  (1845&#150;1902)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 1 July 1845, the second son of John Platt and his wife, Alice. He began work at the age of seventeen, organizing the exhibition of the firm's machinery at the International Exhibition of 1862 in London. He proved to be the only one of the seven brothers with a decided mechanical bent and passed through every department of the works between 1862 and 1865. He became a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange in 1866, a partner in Platt Bros. in 1867, a director in 1868, and, in 1872, the youngest chairman in the firm's history. He maintained the impetus given by his father by making his own tours of world markets between 1865 and 1876 and by extending the influence of senior managers and leading hands. He continued his father's policy of appointing the best managers as directors and from 1872 he made the best foremen into shareholders. He doubled the number of hands from over 6000 in 1872 to 12,000 in 1902, when Howard and Bullough of Accrington employed 6000, Dobson and Barlow of Bolton 4000, and Asa Lees of Oldham 2500. The process of vertical integration was completed with the extension of operations into coalmining in 1874, so safeguarding the interests of the firm against any recurrence of such a &#145;coal famine&#146; as that of 1872&#150;3. The boom of 1873&#150;5 in the formation of joint-stock spinning companies was financed in part by well-paid mechanics, who ensured that orders for machinery were placed with local firms. That boom transformed Oldham into &#145;the metropolis of cotton spinning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oldham Express</span>, 24 June 1882) or &#145;Plattington&#146;  (B. Brierley, &#145;Out of work&#146;, <span class="italic">Tales and Sketches of Lancashire Life</span>, 6, 1885, 5&#150;12). It also sealed the doom of the spinning trade of north-east Lancashire, so that the cotton industry segregated its main processes between the spinning district of south Lancashire and the weaving district of north Lancashire. The firm's profits averaged 11.4 per cent over the thirty years from 1873 to 1902 and its dividends 18 per cent, reaching a relative peak of 37 per cent in 1876&#150;7. The firm established a research department, probably in the 1870s, and manufactured, between 1866 and 1902, four successive models of the new ring spinning frame, becoming in 1888 the largest manufacturers in the world of that machine. Platt Bros. supplied an estimated 36 per cent of the world's increment in cotton spindleage installed between 1880 and 1913. It supplied machinery to the first spinning mills in Venice in 1882, in Turkey in 1888&#150;90, in Guatemala in 1889, in Hanoi in 1893, in Shanghai in 1894, in Cochin in 1895, and in Alexandria and Canton (Guangzhou) in 1900. After 1878 its rivals ceased in chagrin to display their products at international exhibitions. Platt Bros. were the sole British exhibitors at Milan in 1881 and at Chicago in 1893.<br>
<br>S. R. Platt became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1867 and of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1873. He subscribed for 2500 &pound;10 shares in the Manchester Ship Canal Company and served as a director of the company (1885&#150;91), believing that &#145;the trade of the country must centre in Manchester&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oldham Standard</span>, 21 Feb 1891). He carried the company's directors on his yacht, <i>Norseman</i>, on the inaugural voyage of 1 January 1894 along the new waterway. He was elected president of the Oldham chamber of commerce on its formation in 1883 and as such became an <i>ex officio</i> director of the Manchester chamber of commerce. He was elected president of the Oldham District Engineering Trades Association and served as one of Oldham's three representatives on the executive board of the Engineering Employers' Federation established in 1896. Emerging victorious from the strikes of 1897 and 1897&#150;8, he was elected in 1900 to the council of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He fostered the development of technical education and commemorated his father by establishing at Owens College the Platt exhibitions first awarded in 1875, and by enlarging the Oldham School of Science and Art between 1878 and 1881. He became the fourth and last member of the family to join the borough council (1882&#150;92), twice serving as mayor, in 1887 and 1888. He became a county magistrate in 1873, a borough magistrate in 1886, and in 1897 deputy lieutenant and high sheriff of Lancashire. He remained a staunch Liberal, a dedicated Unionist from 1886, a stalwart free-trader, and a confirmed Anglican.<br>
<br>Samuel Platt also developed interests in cricket, music, drama, and foreign travel. He became chairman of the Werneth cricket club from its foundation in 1864, bringing to Oldham an All-England eleven in 1866 and the Australian eleven in 1878 on their first overseas tour. He organized works orchestras in 1865 and 1873 and works choirs in 1878 and 1884. He also gave employment in the works office to the bass baritone Charles Walton, the future father of the composer William Walton (1902&#150;1983). In 1892 he became a founder member and trustee of the Royal Manchester College of Music as well as founder and president of the Oldham School of Music. From 1895 he served as president of the Oldham Orchestral Society, established in 1891. He married into the Irish gentry, taking as his bride on 28 May 1884 Helen May Hodder Roberts (1863&#150;1926), with whom he had two sons and two daughters. In 1897 he became the first member of the family to appear in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as well as in a dictionary of musical biography, which omitted any mention of his business interests. On 5 September 1902 he died on board his yacht in the Menai Strait, at the age of fifty-seven. He was commemorated in the S. R. Platt scholarship at the Oldham School of Music.<br>
<br>Platt Bros. dated its foundation from the years when operations were transferred from Dobcross to Oldham and enjoyed a singularly long lifespan of 161 years (1821&#150;1982). It also established a worldwide reputation, the name of Platt being transliterated into Russian as &#145;Blatt&#146; and into Japanese as &#145;Pratt&#146;. More than any other firm it supported the role assumed during the nineteenth century of &#145;Cotton as a world power&#146;  (J. A. B. Scherer, <span class="italic">Cotton as a World Power</span>, 1916, 1969). In the process it generated wealth for its mechanics and its managers as well as for its owners. Howard and Bullough may well have supplied the industry's first millionaire in the person of John Bullough (1838&#150;1891), who left &pound;1,228,184. The Platts had, however, enlisted the co-operation of their managers as Howard and Bullough had singularly failed to do and reduced the shareholding of the Platt family in Platt Bros. from 82 per cent in 1867 to 52 per cent in 1881. As a direct result of that policy the firm itself paid an average annual dividend of 9.5 per cent (1903&#150;74).<br>
<br>S. R. Platt became the last of the Platts to reside at Werneth Park and to chair the board of directors. He was succeeded by John Dodd (1837&#150;1912), the last of John Platt's lieutenants, under whom production reached its all-time peak level during 1906. The firm experienced two distinct climacterics, in the 1890s and in the 1920s. During the 1890s its golden age came to an end as it was surpassed in size by other firms both at home and abroad. Dividends reached an absolute peak in 1891&#150;2 and profits fell off sharply from 1894 as competition increased in the market for ring frames from Tweedale and Smalley of Rochdale, as well as from Howard and Bullough. Exports of looms reached their peak in 1879 and exports of spindles in 1896. The vast works had by then become too large to be managed efficiently but still underwent extension down to 1929. In the First World War the firm converted its operations to the manufacture of munitions, but the Platt family suffered the loss of four members of the rising generation. The elder son of S. R. Platt, John Rookhurst Platt (1890&#150;1916) of Youlston Park, Barnstaple, Devon, was killed at Ypres on 27 March 1916 and Henry Evelyn Arthur Platt (1884&#150;1916), younger son of John Harold Platt, was killed on 15 May 1916. The only son of Sydney Platt, Lionel Sydney Platt (1885&#150;1917) of St Bruno, Sunningdale, Berkshire, died on 13 April 1917. Maurice Cedric Platt (1892&#150;1918), the younger son of S. R. Platt, died on 26 November 1918, fifteen days after the armistice, at the British legation, The Hague.<br>
<br>It may be doubted whether the fallen officers would, had they survived, have enlisted in the service of the firm. It remains certain, however, that the last member of the family to chair the board was a nephew of John Platt. His sister Louisa Platt (1835&#150;1904) had married William Hall (1825&#150;1887) in 1862 and with him had three sons and one daughter. Her eldest son, Henry Platt Hall (1863&#150;1949), joined the firm in 1880 at the age of seventeen and became a director in 1897, succeeding as chairman from 1920 to 1924. He acquired a Welsh estate at Pentreheylin Hall in Montgomeryshire, became an eminent numismatist and left &pound;138,777, where his father had left only &pound;10,353. His son William Reid Hall (1893&#150;1968) became an engineer and served as a director (1924&#150;62); he also acquired an estate in Montgomeryshire, at Melyniog, and left &pound;70,240. On two occasions, in 1924 and again in 1930, the directors had to recruit a chairman from outside their own ranks. The firm lost the support supplied by an expanding domestic market after the cotton industry reached a climacteric in 1926. It paid no dividends during the black decade of 1927&#150;36, became in 1930 a constituent of Textile Machine Makers Ltd, and passed under the administration of the Prestons, Sir Walter R. Preston (1875&#150;1946) and Sir Kenneth H. Preston (1901&#150;1995), who served as chairman respectively from 1930 to 1946 and from 1946 to 1967.<br>
<br>The three Platts who had created the firm did not, unlike Henry Platt Hall, enjoy a long span of life. They did, however, enhance the status of the family by enormously enlarging its resources. In consequence advantageous marriage alliances could be formed with such families as the Radcliffes and the Duncufts of Oldham and then with the Sykeses and the Wellesleys. It proved much more difficult, however, to provide for the succession to the management of the firm. Only one of Samuel's brothers, James Edward Platt (1856&#150;1928), took an active part in the family business. He became a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange at the age of nineteen in 1876. Then during the 1890s he abandoned business in favour of sport, and acquired a villa at Cannes. Samuel's older brother Henry Platt (1842&#150;1914), after the same education as Samuel, continued it with three years at St John's College, Cambridge. Henry remained a large shareholder in the firm, but never joined the board and spent most of his life outside Oldham, becoming a landowner and a banker. In 1872 he inherited the estate at Gorddinog and became a keen farmer, acquiring a special interest in the breeding of cattle. He built up a fine herd of Welsh black cattle, founded the Welsh Black Cattle Society in 1873, and published <span class="italic">Notes on Black Cattle</span> in 1885. He became high sheriff of Caernarvonshire in 1873 and of Anglesey in 1879. He was twice mayor of Bangor in 1883&#150;5 and in 1884 became a colonel of the fourth battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He became CB in 1897 and was granted arms in 1899, after the sale of the Bryn-y-Neuadd estate, but suffered a defeat in the Caernarfon election of 1900 at the hands of Lloyd George. He was elected principal grand master of the north Wales freemasons in 1905 and left &pound;407,540. His son, Major Eric James William Platt (1872&#150;1946), was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and became high sheriff of Anglesey in 1907. He was the only Platt to survive active service in the First World War and became the last member of the direct male line of the Werneth branch of the family. On the death of his widow the Gorddinog estate was sold in 1956.<br>
<br>John Platt's younger sons received a more conventional education than their two eldest brothers. Apart from James Edward, they became country squires and developed an interest in country sports, so reverting to the rural traditions of the family. Frederick Platt (1849&#150;1906) became a country squire at Barnby Manor near Newark in Nottinghamshire. He acquired interests in four other counties, becoming a major in the Duke of Lancashire's Own yeomanry, deputy lieutenant for Herefordshire, JP for the North Riding of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, and high sheriff and JP for Kesteven, Lincolnshire. In 1883 a grant of arms was made to him and to other descendants of his father, the family motto appearing as &#145;<i>virtute et labore</i>&#146;. He left &pound;243,696, while his son Algernon John Frederick Platt (1875&#150;1912) left &pound;10,233. Joseph Arthur Platt (1852&#150;1904) was educated at Harrow School and St John's, Cambridge, and resided at Brocton Lodge in Staffordshire. John Harold Platt (1855&#150;1912) was also educated at Harrow and St John's. He married into the Irish gentry in 1879 and became a JP and deputy lieutenant for Kent as well as a JP for Anglesey. He died in Belgravia. Sydney Platt (1861&#150;1937) was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. He lived at Bryn-y-Neuadd until 1898 and became high sheriff for Caernarvonshire in 1888. He moved to the south of England after 1898 and finally retired to the Villa Beatrix in the winter resort of Pau in the far south of France, with its congenial clutch of English institutions including the <i>cercle anglais</i>, a fox hunt, a racecourse, and a golf club. He left &pound;567,295.<br>
<br>S. R. Platt bequeathed &pound;200,000 apiece to his two sons and &pound;100,000 each to his two daughters. The lives of the daughters followed divergent patterns: one achieved high social status, the other great material wealth. The elder daughter, Angela May (Angel) (1885&#150;1973), married in 1909 Francis Cecil Brownlow (1870&#150;1932), younger son of Baron Lurgan  (Burke, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>); she had two sons and one daughter and left &pound;339,786. Her daughter, the Hon. Daphne Angela Brownlow (1917&#150;1995), also married into the Irish gentry when she became the bride in 1942 of Lieutenant-Colonel George Edward Brian Brazier-Creagh of the Royal Artillery. She died on 29 July 1995, leaving &pound;1,475,344. The younger daughter of S. R. Platt, Nancy Quenelda Platt (1895&#150;1993), proved to be the longest-lived member of the whole family. She never married but developed an avid interest in the history of the Radcliffe family. Her grandmother Alice had been a Radcliffe and two of her aunts had married Radcliffes. Her interest may have been influenced by the decision of her elder sister to prefer the style of Angela May to her given name of Alice, which was that of her grandmother. That interest culminated in the formal change of her own name, presumably by deed poll, from Platt to Radcliffe-Platt. She died at the age of ninety-seven on 28 April 1993 and was interred at Witherslack, Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria, where her favourite aunt, Emily Bertha Radcliffe (1858&#150;1950), had resided until her death at the age of ninety-one, leaving &pound;5345. The estate of Nancy Quenelda Radcliffe-Platt totalled &pound;8,235,256: in real terms, when adjustment has been made for the depreciation in the value of the pound, it was much less than the estate left by John Platt in 1872. S. R. Platt himself enjoyed a belated commemoration in 1990 when a public house and restaurant named the Samuel Platt was inaugurated on the new Salford Quays by John Camilleri, an enthusiast for the Manchester Ship Canal and an admirer of Samuel Platt. In 1973 the head offices of the firm at Werneth had become one of the first listed buildings in the borough of Oldham.<br>
