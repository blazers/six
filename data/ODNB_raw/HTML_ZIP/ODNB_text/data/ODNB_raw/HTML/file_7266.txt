<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1712&#150;1785), <span class="occ">bookseller and actor</span>, is of unknown origins. He attended the University of Edinburgh between 1728 and 1729 to prepare for one of the learned professions, but left, presumably to become an actor. His first known appearance on the stage was at the theatre in the Haymarket, London (then under the management of Henry Fielding), where on 26 May 1736 he originated the role of Young Wilmot in George Lillo's domestic tragedy <span class="italic">The Fatal Curiosity</span>. Although the reviewer in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> (28 May) observed that the play was acted &#145;with the greatest applause that has been shewn to any tragedy for many years&#146; and that the &#145;scenes of distress were so artfully worked up, and so well performed, that there scarce remained a dry eye among the spectators&#146;  (Van Lennep and others, 3/1.588), the performance did not enable Davies to find steady work as an actor. Shortly afterwards he attempted bookselling at Duke's Court and Round Court, but when the business failed he once more turned to the theatre, and for several years belonged to various companies in York, Dublin, and Edinburgh. While in York he met and married Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1801), actress and daughter of Joseph Yarrow, an actor and writer; her &#145;beauty was not more remarkable than her private character&#146;, which &#145;has ever been unsullied and irreproachable&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 5). The couple returned to London and for the 1753 season were engaged at Drury Lane Theatre, &#145;where they remained for several years in good estimation with the town, and played many characters, if not with great excellence, at least with propriety and decency&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Believing that Davies and his wife earned &pound;500 a year from the stage Samuel Johnson considered it &#145;folly&#146; when Davies left the profession to return to bookselling in 1762. Johnson believed that Davies had been driven from the stage by a line in Charles Churchill's <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span> (1761)&#151;&#145;He mouths a sentence, as curs mouth a bone&#146;&#151;and wondered &#145;what a man is he, who is to be driven from the stage by a line?&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.223). An early biographer of Davies thought that &#145;Churchill's indiscriminate satire&#146; had &#145;endeavoured to fix some degree of ridicule on Mr. Davies's performance; but the pen of a satirist is not entitled to implicit credit&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 5). Davies himself blamed his leaving the stage on Garrick's &#145;warmth of temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.385n.). Whatever the cause he set up as a bookseller at 8 Russell Street, Covent Garden, where he lived until his death. There, in the back parlour of the bookshop, James Boswell first met Johnson, on 16 May 1763. When Boswell published his <span class="italic">Life of Samuel Johnson</span>, twenty-eight years later to the day, he added a note to the passage, describing the first meeting: &#145;No. 8.&#151;The very place where I was fortunate enough to be introduced to the illustrious subject of this work, deserves to be particularly marked. I never pass by it without feeling reverence and regret&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.390n.).<br>
<br>In conversation with John Nichols, Davies described how he had published &#145;a silly pamphlet&#146; in 1742 and then &#145;was smit with the desire of turning author&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 9.665), but it was not until the 1770s that he turned seriously to writing. Johnson's remark that &#145;the biographical part of literature &hellip; is what I love most&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.425) applies equally to Davies, all of whose writings&#151;apart from <span class="italic">Love Poems</span> (1761), <span class="italic">Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces</span> (1773&#150;4), and his catalogues of books for sale&#151;are biographies, contain biographies, or provide materials for future biographies. Davies edited important editions of the works of William Browne (1772), Sir John Davies (1773), Dr John Eachard (1774), George Lillo (1775), and Philip Massinger (1779), all with biographies of varying lengths. In addition he wrote <span class="italic">The characters of George the First, Queen Caroline, Sir Robert Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, Lord Hardwicke, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Pitt, reviewed. With royal and noble anecdotes: and a sketch of Lord Chesterfield's character</span> (1777) and <span class="italic">A genuine narrative of the life and theatrical transactions of Mr. John Henderson, called the Bath Roscius</span> (1777). His most important biography was <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of David Garrick</span> (1780), in two volumes, which had gone through three editions by the following year. It is a wide-ranging &#145;life and times&#146;, but with important information, not only about Garrick but also about Johnson and other contemporaries. Johnson himself contributed the opening sentence, information on Garrick's early life in Lichfield and London, and many anecdotes.<br>
<br>Johnson's assistance to Davies with the memoir was part of a larger attempt to help him to recover from bankruptcy in 1778. Nichols reports that Davies's &#145;great and good friend Dr. Johnson &hellip; exerted all his power on his behalf&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), rallying friends to contribute to make it possible for Davies to recover his household belongings and prevailing on Richard Brinsley Sheridan, patentee of Drury Lane Theatre, to allow him a benefit. On 27 May 1778 Davies returned to the stage one last time, after an absence of sixteen years, to play Fainall in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>.<br>
<br>Davies's financial problems appear to have been of long standing, and one of his schemes for making money has become legendary. In autumn 1773, when Johnson was touring the Hebrides with Boswell, Davies published the first two volumes of <span class="italic">Miscellaneous and Fugitive Pieces</span>, which he advertised as &#145;By the Authour of the Rambler&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.270&#150;71), without Johnson's knowledge or consent. The volumes included some early, uncollected writings by Johnson but also pieces with which he had no connection. Johnson reported to Mrs Thrale (Hester Lynch Piozzi) that when he confronted Davies &#145;I was a fierce fellow, and pretended to be very angry, and Thomas was a good-natured fellow, and pretended to be very sorry: so <i>there</i> the matter ended: I believe the dog loves me dearly&#146;  (Piozzi, 78).<br>
<br>The success of the memoir of Garrick encouraged Davies to publish the three-volume <span class="italic">Dramatic miscellanies: consisting of critical observations on several plays of Shakespeare &hellip; with anecdotes of dramatic poets, actors, &amp;c.</span> (1783&#150;4), which drew on a lifetime of experience and interest in the theatre. After Johnson's death, on 13 December 1784, Davies was thought to be among those undertaking a life. Although his own death would preclude such a project he did provide information for Boswell's life, as well as for William Shaw's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Late Samuel Johnson</span> (1785). He also, according to Nichols, continued to produce miscellaneous writings, &#145;fugitive pieces without number, in prose and verse, in the St. James's Chronicle, and almost all the public newspapers&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
<br>Davies was a member of the club of major booksellers that met monthly at the Shakespeare tavern, where, according to Nichols, &#145;the germ of many a valuable publication&#146; originated, including the life of Garrick, the <span class="italic">Dramatic Miscellanies</span>, and the ideas that led to the publication in 1779 of <span class="italic">Works of the English Poets with Prefaces, Biographical and Critical, by Samuel Johnson</span>  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.325). Davies was one of three booksellers who had visited Johnson to propose the project. Nichols, who &#145;knew Mr. Davies well; and for several years passed many convivial hours in his company at a social meeting; where his lively sallies of pleasantry were certain to entertain his friends by harmless merriment&#146;, describes him as &#145;a man of uncommon strength of mind, who prided himself on being through life a companion for his superiors&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). Boswell described him as &#145;a man of good understanding and talents, with the advantage of a liberal education. Though somewhat pompous, he was an entertaining companion; and his literary performances have no inconsiderable share of merit&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.390&#150;91). Johnson praised him as having &#145;learning enough to give credit to a clergyman&#146;  (ibid., 4.13) but also thought that no one could &#145;bring more amusement on his tongue, or more kindness in his heart&#146;  (ibid., 4.231).<br>
<br>On Davies's last visit to the club &#145;he wore the appearance of a spectre; and, sensible of his approaching end, took a solemn benediction&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). He died on 5 May 1785 and was buried in the vault of St Paul's, Covent Garden. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 February 1801.<br>
