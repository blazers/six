<span class="headword">Dineley <span class="st"> [Dingley]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the son of Thomas Dineley or Dingley, controller of customs at Southampton. Having attended the school kept by the dramatist James Shirley in Whitefriars, London, in August 1670 he became a student at Gray's Inn, but in the following year joined the household of Sir George Downing, on his appointment as ambassador to the states general of the United Provinces.<br>
<br>Thereafter Dineley travelled extensively in the British Isles and on the continent, recording his trips in manuscript journals illustrated by vigorous pen-and-ink drawings, such as <span class="italic">Travails through the Low Countreys, 1674</span> and <span class="italic">Observations in a Voyage in the Kingdom of France, 1675</span>. His work is typical of that of many antiquaries of the late seventeenth century, not only in that none of it was published during his lifetime, but also in its shift over time in perspective and choice of subject matter. His journey to Ireland in 1680, possibly undertaken in a military capacity, provided a very detailed description (written the following year) of what he saw there, which also records what Dineley clearly considered to be the outlandish customs and behaviour of its people. Less prone to his personal prejudices and more &#145;archaeological&#146; in approach&#151;and thus more reliable from an antiquarian perspective&#151;is the account he wrote of Wales as he accompanied Henry Somerset, first duke of Beaufort, in his 1684 progress through the principality as lord president of the council in the marches of Wales. The information and drawings of churches, castles, country houses, and other historic sites contained in this diary formed the basis for Theophilus Jones's <span class="italic">A History of the County of Brecknock</span>, published in two volumes in 1805 and 1809, while a substantial part of Dineley's own journal was privately printed as <span class="italic">Notitia Cambro-Britannica</span> for the eighth duke of Beaufort in 1864.<br>
<br>Of equal antiquarian interest is Dineley's manuscript &#145;History from marble&#146;, the last observation in which is dated 30 April 1684, containing many fine drawings and short accounts of country houses as well as church monuments and inscriptions. In geographical spread it concentrates on Bath, Oxford, and the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, providing much of the material used in Richard Rawlinson's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the City and Cathedral Church of Hereford</span> (1717) and Treadway Russell Nash's <span class="italic">Collections for the History of Worcestershire</span> (2 vols., 1781&#150;2).<br>
<br>Virtually nothing is known of Dineley's personal life, other than that when not travelling he lived at Dilwyn, Herefordshire, and that he died at Louvain, Flanders, in May 1695. At this time he seems to have been unmarried: his heir was his niece, the daughter of his sister, Eliza, wife of William Melling.<br>
