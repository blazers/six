</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">D'Israeli,  Isaac</span>  (1766&#150;1848), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 11 May 1766 at 5 Great St Helen's, London, the only child of Benjamin D'Israeli (1730&#150;1816), merchant, and his second wife, Sarah Syprut de Gabay Villa Real (1742/3&#150;1825). D'Israeli's father was born at Cento, Ferrara, emigrated to London in 1748, and began business on his own there in 1757 as an importer of Italian goods, especially the fashionable Leghorn straw hats. From 1776 he was also in business as a stockbroker, and in 1801 he became an English denizen and a founder member of the London stock exchange. On his death his estate was valued at &pound;35,000. D'Israeli's mother was the daughter of one of her husband's business associates. His father seems to have been sociable and generous, and his mother withdrawn and difficult.<br>
<br>Isaac was &#145;a pale, pensive child, with large brown eyes, and flowing hair &hellip; timid, susceptible, lost in reverie, fond of solitude, or seeking no better company than a book&#146;  (Disraeli, &#145;Life and writings&#146;, xi). He was sent to a school kept by a Scotsman named Morison, near Enfield, Middlesex, where his father had a country house. The elder D'Israeli hoped his son would go into business, and in 1780&#150;81 sent him to stay with his agent in Amsterdam; but he showed no aptitude for business, began to acquire a wide knowledge of modern languages and literatures, and came home determined to be a poet and man of letters. His mother ridiculed his ambition, and his father urged him to join a commercial house at Bordeaux, so he wrote a satire on commerce, which he left at Bolt Court hoping for Dr Johnson's approval, but Johnson was ill and the manuscript was returned unread. D'Israeli's first critical article was a vindication of Johnson's character in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for December 1786. His first published poem was a panegyric on Richard Gough the topographer, an Enfield neighbour, in the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> for 20 November 1787, to which Gough wrote a sarcastic reply. His father's patience was exhausted, and in 1788&#150;9 D'Israeli was sent abroad again, to travel in France, Germany, and Italy. He became an enthusiast for French philosophy and, for a time, the French Revolution. In July 1789 he achieved some notoriety by publishing an anonymous satire on the popular satirist Peter Pindar (Dr John Wolcot) in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Wolcot attributed the satire to the poet William Hayley and published a counterblast, whereupon D'Israeli acknowledged the authorship and was befriended not only by some of Wolcot's earlier victims but also by Wolcot himself. The friendly intervention of Henry James Pye, the poet laureate, may have persuaded the elder D'Israeli to acquiesce in his son's adoption of a literary career; D'Israeli's first volume of verse, <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span> (1790), was dedicated to Pye. As a poet his most ambitious work was <span class="italic">Narrative Poems</span> (1803). His neo-classical manner was by then hopelessly outmoded, but being a poet of sorts himself he had a sympathetic understanding of the poetical temperament.<br>
<br>In 1791 D'Israeli inherited the whole fortune of his maternal grandmother Esther Syprut, and so became financially independent. He took rooms in James Street, Adelphi, then a haunt of literary men, and began to frequent the British Museum, where he met Francis Douce and other scholars. In the same year he published anonymously the first volume of <span class="italic">Curiosities of literature, consisting of anecdotes, characters, sketches, and observations, literary, critical, and historical</span>. This compilation followed the fashion for biographical anecdotes, and was an immediate success. A second volume, with the author's name on the title-page, was added in 1793; a third in 1817; and a <span class="italic">Second Series</span>, in three more volumes, in 1823. The work was often revised (13th edn, 1843) and gradually became more like a collection of essays. Between 1794 and 1796 D'Israeli apparently suffered a nervous breakdown, certainly enjoyed a convalescence at Exeter, and wrote <span class="italic">An Essay on the Literary Character</span> (1795), and <span class="italic">Miscellanies, or, Literary Recreations</span> (1796), which he dedicated to his medical adviser Dr Hugh Downman. By now his books had made a name for him in London, and in 1796 he was the subject of a highly respectful &#145;Biographical sketch&#146; in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>. Expanded versions of the <span class="italic">Essay</span>, under the title <span class="italic">The Literary Character</span>, appeared in 1818, 1822 (2 vols.), and 1828 (2 vols.). It developed into an influential study of the characteristics of men of genius, and a romantic assertion of their importance to society. Offshoots were <span class="italic">Calamities of Authors</span> (2 vols., 1812) and <span class="italic">Quarrels of Authors</span> (3 vols., 1814).<br>
<br>D'Israeli for a time fancied himself as a writer of prose fiction. His <span class="italic">Romances</span> (&#145;Mejnoun and Leila: a Persian Romance&#146;, &#145;Love and Humility: a Roman Romance&#146;, and &#145;The Lovers, or, The Birth of the Pleasing Arts: an Arcadian Romance&#146;) were published in 1797 (3rd edn, 1807). &#145;Mejnoun and Leila&#146; was the most elaborate of these, and its flowery orientalism had some influence on Benjamin Disraeli. D'Israeli's first novel, <span class="italic">Vaurien, or, Sketches of the Times</span>, also appeared in 1797. <span class="italic">Flim-Flams! or, The Life and Errors of my Uncle</span> followed in 1805 (2nd edn, 1806) and <span class="italic">Despotism, or, The Fall of the Jesuits</span> in 1811. <span class="italic">Vaurien</span> was a satire on William Godwin and other English Jacobins; <span class="italic">Flim-Flams!</span> in a more frivolous vein satirized various contemporary literary men, scientists, and inventors; <span class="italic">Despotism</span> was a melodramatic historical novel comparing the despotisms of the Jesuits and Napoleon. D'Israeli pioneered types of subject-matter and modes of presentation which were more effectively used by Thomas Love Peacock, Benjamin Disraeli, and others, but his novels lacked interesting characterization and artistic unity.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1802 D'Israeli entered &#145;the matrimonial state of literature&#146; (a chapter heading in <span class="italic">The Literary Character</span>). His wife, Maria Basevi (1774/5&#150;1847), belonged to another Italian-Jewish family living in London, and was the aunt of the architect George Basevi (1794&#150;1845). The marriage was a happy one. The D'Israelis went to live at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, where their five children were born: Sarah (1802&#150;1859); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7689/', "Benjamin Disraeli (1804&#150;1881)")</script>, the statesman and novelist; Naphtali (<i>b</i>. 1807, died in infancy); Ralph (1809&#150;1898); and James (1813&#150;1868). The children were named according to Jewish naming customs, and the boys were circumcised. D'Israeli was a member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue, and an annual contributor to its funds, but not a regular attender at its services. In 1813 the elders elected him warden, anticipating that he would refuse to serve and pay a fine. D'Israeli told them the office was &#145;repulsive to his feelings&#146;; he could &#145;never unite in your public worship because, as now conducted, it disturbs, instead of exciting, religious emotions&#146;  (Picciotto, 297&#150;8). He refused to pay a fine, and after a long quarrel withdrew from the synagogue in 1821. In a chapter in <span class="italic">Vaurien</span>, an essay on Moses Mendelssohn (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 6, July 1798, 38&#150;44), and especially in <span class="italic">The Genius of Judaism</span> (1833), D'Israeli argued for the emancipation of the Jews rather than their conversion to Christianity, and for the Jews themselves to educate their children as &#145;the youth of Europe, and not of Palestine&#146;  (D'Israeli, <span class="italic">The Genius of Judaism</span>, 1833, 265). On the advice of his friend the historian Sharon Turner, all his children were baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, in 1817, but apparently membership of the Church of England was valued for its social advantages. In the same year the family moved to a larger house in Bloomsbury Square near the British Museum, and in 1829 they moved to Bradenham House near High Wycombe. This part of Buckinghamshire attracted D'Israeli by its many literary and historical associations.<br>
<br>D'Israeli was well known in several literary circles. Pye introduced him to the poet Samuel Rogers, who enviously remarked, &#145;There is a man with only half an intellect; and yet he makes books that can't help living&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</span>, 4.265). He was for a while on the fringe of the Jacobin group associated with the publisher Richard Phillips and the bookseller Joseph Johnson, and was one of the early customers for William Blake's illuminated books. But D'Israeli's own books were mostly published by John Murray II, and through him he met Murray's other authors and contributors to the tory <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Among these was Sir Walter Scott, who at their first meeting is said to have repeated one of D'Israeli's poems, adding &#145;if the writer of these lines had gone on, he would have been an English poet&#146;  (Disraeli, &#145;Life and writings&#146;, xxv). Lord Byron greatly admired <span class="italic">The Literary Character</span> and told Murray &#145;I don't know a living man's book I take up so often or lay down more reluctantly&#146;  (Smiles, 152). When a defence of the poetry of Pope appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> in 1820 Byron was delighted and recognized D'Israeli as the author by the style. Robert Southey thought D'Israeli &#145;thoroughly good-natured, the strangest mixture of information and ignorance, cleverness and folly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</span>, 3.352). D'Israeli dedicated the fourth edition of <span class="italic">The Literary Character</span> to him, remarking that knowing each other primarily through their books they had long enjoyed &#145;an intimacy, without the inconvenience, often resulting from a personal acquaintance&#146;  (Ogden, 126). D'Israeli also met through Murray the poet Thomas Moore, the critic John Wilson Croker, and the antiquary Thomas Crofton Croker. Moore he also met at the Athenaeum, and Crofton Croker at the Society of Antiquaries. Murray quarrelled with the D'Israeli family in 1826 when with some reason the publisher thought himself caricatured in Benjamin's novel <span class="italic">Vivian Grey</span>. But Benjamin introduced his father to another admirer, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who dedicated to D'Israeli the fourth book, <span class="italic">View of the Intellectual Spirit of the Time</span>, of his <span class="italic">England and the English</span> (1833). When he was in his seventies his son introduced him into Lady Blessington's circle, where he met Walter Savage Landor. D'Israeli, then, was a more sociable and forceful character than his son's memoir suggests.<br>
<br>In his own time D'Israeli had a considerable reputation as a historian. In 1816 he published <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Literary and Political Character of James I</span>, and between 1828 and 1830 the five volumes of <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Life and Reign of Charles I</span>. <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> marked an advance in historical research, as D'Israeli consulted many unpublished manuscripts, but his claims to objectivity were exaggerated. Both works defend the Stuart kings against the whig historians; he concedes that they had their faults, but argues that James was no fool and Charles was a man more sinned against than sinning. The effect was to support a tory view of history, and so to influence the ideas of Benjamin Disraeli and the &#145;Young England&#146; group. <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> was attacked for its implicit toryism by Lord Nugent in his <span class="italic">Memorials of Hampden</span> (1832), and D'Israeli immediately replied with the pamphlet <span class="italic">Eliot, Hampden, and Pym</span>. All three of these were reviewed by Robert Southey, who described <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> as &#145;by far the most important work&#146; on its subject in recent times  (<span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 47, 1832, 470). It was as the defender of Charles I that D'Israeli was created honorary doctor of civil law by Oxford University later in the same year.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Commentaries</span> distracted D'Israeli from his ultimate project, a history of English literature. In 1833 he returned to work on it, but by January 1835 he feared the deterioration of his eyesight would prevent its completion. Another problem was a controversy with the antiquarian Bolton Corney, who in <span class="italic">Curiosities of Literature Illustrated</span> (1837) exposed many of D'Israeli's mistakes in the original <span class="italic">Curiosities</span>. D'Israeli replied with <span class="italic">The Illustrator Illustrated</span> (1838), but Corney's attacks continued in further publications, and D'Israeli admitted that &#145;a voluminous miscellany, composed at various periods, cannot be exempted from slight inadvertencies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Curiosities</span>, 11th edn, 1839, &#145;Preface&#146;). Towards the end of that year he suffered &#145;a paralysis of the optic nerve&#146;  (Disraeli, &#145;Life and writings&#146;, xxxv), or acute retinal degeneration, and became almost blind. But with the help of his daughter he was able to publish <span class="italic">Amenities of Literature</span> (3 vols., 1841), which he originally intended to call &#145;A fragment of a history of English literature&#146;. In an unsystematic way <span class="italic">Amenities</span> carries the subject down to the early seventeenth century. It includes much curious information, appreciative essays on Chaucer, Skelton, and Spenser, and in the essay on Shakespeare an early protest against bardolatry. D'Israeli's enthusiasm saves him from the pedantry and dogmatism of some later authorities. <span class="italic">Amenities</span> was his last book, but he lived long enough to see his son's first successes in literature and politics. He found Disraeli's <span class="italic">Tancred</span> (1847), a novel about the reconciliation of Judaism and Christianity, &#145;faultless in composition, profound in philosophy&#146;  (Monypenny and Buckle, 1.865). Isaac D'Israeli died at his home, Bradenham House, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 19 January 1848, a victim of influenza, and was buried in the churchyard at Bradenham.<br>
<br>D'Israeli's reputation in the nineteenth century was founded on his talent for popularizing literary and historical research. He read widely and in some fields deeply, and Bulwer-Lytton remarked that often what looked like gossip was really philosophy, especially in <span class="italic">The Literary Character</span>. Benjamin Disraeli edited new editions of <span class="italic">Curiosities</span> in 1849, of <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> in 1851, and of the complete literary and historical <span class="italic">Works</span> (other than <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>) in 1858&#150;9. <span class="italic">Curiosities</span> and the <span class="italic">Works</span> were frequently reissued in popular editions both here and in the United States. Before the development of secondary and higher education, these books were for many readers exciting introductions to new areas of knowledge and speculation.<br>
