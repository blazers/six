<span class="headword">Pestell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was baptized on 9 October 1586 at St Martin's, Leicester, the eldest of five children of Thomas Pestell, tailor, and Sarah Fawkoner (<i>d</i>. 1610), who had married the previous April. He matriculated from Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1602, graduated BA in 1606 and proceeded MA in 1609. Two years later he was presented by Sir Thomas Beaumont to the rectory of Coleorton, Leicestershire. Probably in 1612 he married Sarah Carr (<i>d</i>. in or after 1647), daughter of an Essex clergyman, thereby &#145;disappointing&#146; a Mistress Stacy and initiating a lengthy feud with her family. The Pestells' eldest son, <a name="cosubject_22010"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Pestell</span>  (1613&#150;1690)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Coleorton on 1 May 1613; their other children included William (1615&#150;1696), Margaret, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1623), Lettice (<i>bap</i>. 1627), and Walter (<i>bap</i>. 1628).<br>
<br>Over the next decade Pestell published <span class="italic">The Good Conscience</span> (1615) and two assize sermons which castigated the love of money and the oppression of the poor, <span class="italic">Morbus epidemicus, or, The Churles Sicknesse</span> (1615), dedicated to Beaumont, and <span class="italic">The Poore Mans Appeale</span> (1620), dedicated to Sir Henry Hobart, chief justice of common pleas. In 1615 he became chaplain to Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, and may have written the Spenserian &#145;Coleorton Masque&#146; performed in 1618 to celebrate the wedding of Essex's sister. About this time he was mocked in a verse letter by Edward Catlin for the enthusiasm with which he sought the patronage of Elizabeth Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, through whose influence he also became vicar of Packington in 1622. Regarding himself as &#145;a poor retired Vicar in an obscure angle of the Countrey&#146; he published nothing more until persuaded by Alderman James Ellis of Leicester to issue a sermon preached at an ordinary visitation of the town; <span class="italic">Gods Visitation</span> (1630) was dedicated to his friends the mayor, recorder, and corporation. In 1633 he produced two elegies for the countess of Huntingdon, and his work must have had a wider currency since in 1636 he acknowledged Queen Henrietta Maria's appreciation of his poetry.<br>
<br>Pestell was a controversial figure, capable of arrogance and even violence. By 1633 he had been accused of ecclesiastical irregularities before the court of high commission by Joseph Johnson and one of the Stacy family, but charges against him in the 1640s point to at least a degree of conformity in the previous decade, and Pestell was acquitted, although ordered to apologize to his patrons and pay damages to others. His credit was sufficient to gain him a royal chaplaincy: between 1641 and 1644 he appeared on the monthly rota for September.<br>
<br>Pestell's two older sons followed him into the ministry. Thomas the younger matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, on 29 August 1628, moved to Queens' College, graduated BA in 1633, and proceeded MA in 1636. He may have written the Latin play <span class="italic">Versipellis</span>, performed at Queens' in 1632, as well as other writings usually attributed to his father. William matriculated from Queens' in 1631, graduated BA in 1634, and proceeded MA in 1638. In or before 1644 Pestell resigned the Packington and Coleorton rectories to Thomas and William respectively, remaining as curate in the former parish.<br>
<br>The villages were at the heart of civil-war engagements in Leicestershire: Pestell's house was apparently looted eleven times. In April 1646 he and his elder son were charged before the parliamentary committee, on the accusation of Johnston and Stacy, among others, with a variety of offences including officiating according to the prayer book, employing scandalous curates, keeping hunting beagles which damaged neighbours' property, and living in the royalist garrison at Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Both denied many of the charges and the younger Thomas explained his presence at Ashby as necessitated by his being chaplain to the earl of Huntingdon. None the less, they were sequestered, and Thomas senior was ejected from Packington by soldiers; William suffered the same fate at Coleorton in 1652. Several times imprisoned, Pestell senior was dependent thereafter on charity, assuming the pointed pseudonym Perditus. Both he and Thomas the younger contributed to <span class="italic">Lachrymae musarum</span> (1649), in memory of Henry Hastings, Lord Hastings, and the father went on to write prefatory verse for Edward Benlowes's <span class="italic">Theophila, or, Loves Sacrifice</span> (1652). His <span class="italic">Sermons and Devotions Old and New</span> (1659), published &#145;as an oblation of gratitude to all such of the nobility, gentry and clergy as retain the noble conscience of having ministred to the weak condition of the author, now aged 73&#146;, also contained a discourse on duels. In 1658 he had acquired the patronage of Sir Justinian Isham, and the following year he became vicar of St Mary's, Leicester.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Pestell became rector of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and confrator of Wigston's Hospital, Leicester. He died there about 30 June 1667 and was buried in the chapel there on 2 July. Thomas Pestell the younger was restored to Packington in 1662, became rector of Markfield on 1 October 1677, and died in 1690. William was restored to Coleorton in 1660, published <span class="italic">A Congratulation to his Sacred Majesty</span> (1661), and became rector of Ravenstone, Leicestershire, in 1667. He died in 1696 and was buried at Coleorton on 31 January.<br>
