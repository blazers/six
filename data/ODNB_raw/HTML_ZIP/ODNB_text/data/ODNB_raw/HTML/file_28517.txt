<span class="headword">Walker,  Anthony</span>  (1726&#150;1765), <span class="occ">etcher and engraver</span>, was born at Thirsk, Yorkshire, and baptized there on 19 March 1726, the son of John Walker (<i>d</i>. 1763), an exciseman; he was apparently the sixth son in a family of ten children. Having been apprenticed in the Goldsmiths' Company to the London engraver and printseller John Tinney on 2 May 1740, he became free of the company on 5 April 1753. During this period he also studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy.<br>
<br>Walker was one of the most gifted engravers of the period, known for topographical views, religious and genre subjects, portraits, and book illustrations. Individual plates were exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1760 onwards, and he produced a number of fine large-scale prints for the publisher John Boydell, sometimes in collaboration with William Woollett. Walker's technique was heavily reliant on etching rather than pure engraving, a means that gave his work its characteristic fluidity of line. It was not a technique, however, which produced plates capable of prolonged use, and his work is best judged from the earliest impressions that may be found. Walker also has claims as an original artist, and he designed original frontispieces and illustrations of great verve and style. His illustrations for Tobias Smollett's <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves</span>, serialized in the <span class="italic">British Magazine</span> (1760&#150;61), are believed to be the earliest magazine illustrations for any serialized novel.<br>
<br>Working from premises originally in Great Kirby Street and by 1763 at the corner of Nevils Court, Fetter Lane, Walker numbered among his apprentices Joseph Ryland, Thomas Cook, and Joseph Collyer. Little record survives of his personal life and character. Horace Walpole, who admired his work, expressed exasperation at Walker's reluctance to tackle more ambitious subjects. Walker's reported response, that &#145;he had got fame enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.19), although considered &#145;shameful&#146; by Walpole, may equally have been expressive of any emotion from an innate modesty to an irritation at being told his business by a man of leisure. Walker died at Kensington, London, on 9 May 1765 and was buried in the parish churchyard. Administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Mary Walker, of whom nothing further is known.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28517"></a><span class="headword">William Walker</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the younger brother of Anthony Walker and the seventh son in the family, was baptized at Thirsk on 4 December 1729. After serving an apprenticeship with a dyer he went to London and was trained by his brother. He was a gifted artist responsible for a wide variety of engraved portraits, historical scenes, and views, including landscapes after Paul Sandby, and his neat work graced many of the most handsome illustrated books of the period. Like his brother, he engraved larger plates for Boydell, but this connection was discontinued when Walker returned a painting which he considered obscene. He was the inventor of the &#145;rebiting&#146; technique much employed by Woollett, who claimed never to complete a plate without a renewal of gratitude. Walker was noted for his serene temperament and the domestic felicity of his marriage of thirty-four years. His final years were spent in seclusion and he died at his house in Rosoman Street, Clerkenwell, on 18 February 1793.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28497"></a><span class="headword">John Walker</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1784&#150;1802), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the only son of William Walker, was responsible for <span class="italic">The Copper-Plate Magazine, or, Monthly Cabinet of Picturesque Prints</span> (1792&#150;1802), a much esteemed compilation which he engraved and published and which gave employment to the young J. M. W. Turner. Walker had learned his craft under his father, with whom he frequently worked in collaboration.<br>
