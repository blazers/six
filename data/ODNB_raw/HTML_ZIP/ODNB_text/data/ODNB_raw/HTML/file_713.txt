<span class="headword">Arundel <span class="st"> [Fitzalan]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1353&#150;1414), <span class="occ">administrator and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9534/', "Richard (II) Fitzalan, third earl of Arundel and eighth earl of Surrey (c.1313&#150;1376)")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1372), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12959/', "Henry, earl of Lancaster")</script>, and widow of John, Lord Beaumont. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/718/', "Sir John Arundel")</script> was his elder brother.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandearlycareer"></a>Childhood and early career</h2>The course of Arundel's life was determined by his high birth. He was the youngest of three sons, and his early career in the church was planned from birth, for his father had served as an envoy at the papal curia and was in a position to promote his son's interests. Arundel's first benefice at Taunton in July 1370 was a royal presentation, and by March 1372 he held a wide range of benefices. Thanks to parental pressure, the co-operation of Edward III, and the assistance of Pope Gregory XI (<i>r</i>. 1370&#150;78), Arundel was provided to the bishopric of Ely on 13 August 1373 at the age of twenty. He was consecrated on 9 April following, and the temporalities were restored on 5 May 1374. The pope himself subsequently declared that &#145;no-one so young has been appointed to a see&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 4.129).<br>
<br>Arundel's career at Oxford had begun about 1369 or 1370, though the earliest evidence of his presence there comes from some time before May 1372, when he was appointed to settle a dispute over the election of proctors. He was resident in Oriel College in June 1373, and, with the assistance of his father, endowed the college chapel in November 1373. Family pressure prevented his progressing beyond the rank of BA. His mother died in 1372, and by 1374 his father was infirm and Arundel was required to deputize in the management of the family estates in Sussex and Surrey. He was later appointed the chief executor of his father's will. Earl Richard's death, on 24 January 1376, nevertheless freed the young bishop from paternal domination, and allowed him to concentrate on a career in church and state.<h2>
<a name="OpponentofRichardII"></a>Opponent of Richard II</h2>After his father's death, the shape of Arundel's career, especially his role in high politics, was determined by the influence of his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9535/', "Richard (III) Fitzalan, fourth earl of Arundel")</script>, an outspoken critic of Richard II's government. Thomas provided more measured criticism. In October 1386 he visited the king with Thomas, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1397), and outlined the rights and privileges of parliament <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the king. When Richard II threatened to summon French aid, Arundel claimed that the people had a right by ancient statute to depose with common consent a king who alienated his people, and to appoint a new person from the royal line. Parliament secured the removal of the chancellor, the earl of Suffolk, whose place Arundel took on 24 October 1386. A committee of fourteen was appointed to act as the king's continual council for a year, led by Arundel. Its function was to reform government and restrict the influence of informal royal advisers. The king responded by leaving Westminster, and by 1387 he was in open conflict with Richard (III) Fitzalan and Gloucester. Arundel tried to mediate between them, but a number of the king's courtiers were arrested. Arundel then opened parliament (the Merciless Parliament of 1388) with a sermon explaining how the great debates and disorders existing by reason of lack of good government could be ended. Because of his ecclesiastical position, Arundel took no part in the actual trial in parliament of Richard's favourites, but he was translated to the see of the exiled archbishop of York, Alexander Neville (<i>d</i>. 1392), on 3 April 1388.<br>
<br>In 1389 Richard II regained control of government, and Arundel lost his office as chancellor on 4 May; but while his brother, the earl of Arundel, became increasingly isolated, Thomas Arundel's prestige was such that he was reappointed chancellor on 27 September 1391. It is possible that his influence as archbishop of York was behind the king's decision to move the chancery, king's bench, and certain departments of the exchequer to York in 1392. When Richard II went to Ireland in 1394&#150;5, affairs of church and state twice led Arundel to visit him there, and he helped to negotiate the king's marriage to Princess Isabella of France in late summer 1396. On 25 September of that year he was translated to succeed William Courtenay as archbishop of Canterbury, and resigned as chancellor two days later. By this time he was possibly falling out of royal favour and could have been behind the petition in parliament in February 1397 of a former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Thomas Haxey, complaining of excessive expenditure in the royal household. Haxey's arrest for treason signalled moves in September 1397 against all those involved in measures against Richard II's household in 1388: Richard Fitzalan was tried in parliament for treason and beheaded, while Thomas Arundel was condemned on 25 September as a traitor for his part in the events of 1386&#150;8. He was barred from attending to defend himself; the speaker, Sir John Bussy (<i>d</i>. 1399), was reported to have said &#145;his cunning might outwit us all&#146;  (&#145;Annales Ricardi secundi&#146;, 210). Richard II disliked Arundel, fearing what was described in parliament as the archbishop's &#145;untrustworthy and vengeful character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Adam of Usk</span>, 27). His temporalities were confiscated, and he was sent into exile and translated to the (schismatic) see of St Andrews. Arundel went to Rome to plead his case, then to Florence, Cologne, Utrecht, and other cities, before joining Henry Bolingbroke, earl of Derby (exiled in September 1398), in Paris&#151;in spite of royal orders forbidding such communication.<br>
<br>Arundel accompanied Bolingbroke on his return to England at Ravenspur on 4 July 1399. It is likely that he influenced Bolingbroke's declaration, sworn on oath at Doncaster before the earl of Northumberland, that he did not intend to take the crown but to control the king by appointing officials and reforming the household&#151;measures that looked back to those of the October parliament of 1386. The deposition of Richard was probably discussed between Bolingbroke and Arundel, but only as one option among several at this stage; however, it became a more feasible option as Bolingbroke found Richard's administration collapsing before him. According to an eyewitness, Jean Creton, the king sent an envoy from Conwy to Bolingbroke at Chester to explore his purpose; Arundel held a prominent place in discussions with Bolingbroke about the reply, but probably did not go to Conwy himself. Among other things, Northumberland proposed referring the trial of Richard's unpopular counsellors to parliament, to be followed by a recrowning of Richard. As this alluded to events occurring at the end of the Merciless Parliament it is likely that Arundel was behind this programme. As Richard then rode to meet Bolingbroke he was ambushed and taken to Flint Castle where, according to Creton, Arundel spoke to the king, and told him not to be afraid, that no harm would come to his person. Richard was then taken in captivity to London. Arundel now drew closer to Bolingbroke, discussing preparations that lay behind the king's enforced abdication on 29 September and the schedule of accusations that justified Richard's deposition and Bolingbroke's recognition as his successor the following day. The leading part played by Arundel in the revolution that set Henry IV on the throne culminated in the assembly of 30 September, when Arundel directed proceedings, and preached a sermon based on God's choice of Saul as leader of the Israelites. The archbishop opened the next parliament on 6 October, and crowned the new king one week later.<h2>
<a name="ServantoftheLancastriandynasty"></a>Servant of the Lancastrian dynasty</h2>Arundel could have found intellectual justification for his role in the deposition of Richard II during his exile in the thought of the chancellor of Florence, Coluccio Salutati, whose treatise <span class="italic">De tyranno</span> appeared in 1400. According to Salutati, anyone who did not rule justly and according to law was a public enemy, who could lawfully be resisted. But in his sermon to parliament of 6 October 1399 Arundel attempted to distance the new regime from Richard's autocracy on more traditional grounds, criticizing the deposed king's dependence on favourites, and declaring that Henry IV intended to govern not through his own will, but with the consent of those of honourable descent. Arundel's main priority during the first half of Henry IV's reign, however, was the church. By 1 October he had resumed his archiepiscopal authority, although this was not formally restored until the 19th. He now absented himself for long periods from less formal participation in government and politics and from the court. In 1400, when there was no parliament, he was only in London for two months of the year. He was still consulted on such matters as using the crown jewels as security for a loan (September 1402) and he made intermittent appearances in council meetings. Between October 1399 and February 1403, indeed, he attended a quarter of recorded council meetings, and this increased during the following four years, as he spent more time in the capital.<br>
<br>However, during the latter period there seems to have been a cooling in relations between Arundel and Henry IV; as dissent grew towards the new regime, the archbishop could not escape suspicion of involvement. In January 1405 rumours of a plot against King Henry on behalf of the Mortimers led to aspersions being cast on Arundel's loyalty, and he had to kneel publicly before the king and demand that his accusers bring their charges against him. Then in June 1405 his friend and fellow archbishop, Richard Scrope, raised an army outside York in support of a Percy-led insurrection. A manifesto attributed to Scrope called for a removal of the burdens falling on the clergy. Arundel must have been compromised to some extent, for if there was a national movement against the abuse of the rights and privileges of the church he would have been its leader: less than a year earlier, in the Coventry parliament of 1404, the Commons had proposed the alienation of the temporalities of the church for the king's use for one year, and Arundel had delivered such a stinging rebuke (backed up by Scrope) that the clergy managed to escape the imposition.<br>
<br>When Arundel heard of Scrope's surrender and capture outside York, and the king's intention to execute the archbishop, he rode all day and the following night from London in a bid to prevent this. On 8 June he warned Henry IV of the consequences of laying hands on an archbishop, and advised him to leave judgment to the pope, or at least to a trial in parliament. The king assured Arundel that nothing would be done without his consent, but while the exhausted prelate slept Scrope was tried and executed. Arundel reacted to this deception with a physical collapse, while Innocent VII (<i>r</i>. 1404&#150;6) pronounced sentence of excommunication on the perpetrators of the deed; once again Arundel was compromised because of his family (the trial was presided over by his nephew, the young Thomas, seventeenth earl of Arundel), and also through his desire to preserve the stability of the new dynasty. He decided to rescue Henry from a difficult situation by neglecting to publish the sentence of excommunication. This pragmatic decision marked a drawing together of king and archbishop in a more formal association.<br>
<br>In the parliaments of the years that followed, which Arundel regularly attended, Commons and council discussed ways of achieving better government, especially in the fields of financial management, defence, and the maintenance of the resources of the monarchy through the controlling of grants and the management of the household. On 22 May 1406, in the course of a parliament that sat intermittently from March to December, Henry IV accepted a bill of thirty-one articles appointing an advisory council to assist him in the business of government. Two days later Arundel, acting as its spokesman, declared that his newly constituted council would only serve if supplied with sufficient revenue. His dominant position among the king's advisers was formally endorsed when on 30 January he was appointed chancellor. Arundel's tenure of the great seal was a means by which the king, whose health was beginning to fail, held on to his full prerogative in the face of challenges from Prince Henry and the Beaufort family. At the Gloucester parliament of late 1407 he preached on the appropriate text, &#145;Honour the King who Honours God&#146;. But by 21 December 1409 the king's position had become so weak that the prince was able to force Arundel to resign as chancellor and thereby gain control of the council. In late 1411 the king reasserted his authority, dismissing the prince and his associates from council, and on 5 January 1412 Arundel was reinstated as chancellor. Then on 21 March 1413 Henry V became king; he dismissed Arundel from the chancellorship the same day.<br>
<br>Arundel's role in government under Henry IV was consistent with the position he had taken up under the appellants in 1388. Loyal to the interests of his family, the Fitzalans, despite his defence of Henry IV's prerogative, he nevertheless sought to make the crown financially solvent through good counsel, upholding a style of administration whereby the king could be subjected to criticism and direction from lords lay and ecclesiastical demanding a say in government. It is therefore no surprise that Arundel should have antagonized both Richard II and the future Henry V, both in their different ways autocrats; ultimately the future lay with them.<h2>
<a name="Pastoralreformer"></a>Pastoral reformer</h2>As a leader of the church Arundel was responsible for revitalizing an institution in crisis. He was, as far as his governmental responsibilities allowed, a largely resident bishop of Ely and archbishop of York and Canterbury and a conscientious administrator; and he was also a pastoral reformer. If Archbishop John Thoresby (<i>d</i>. 1373) and his staff had been concerned with raising standards of literacy and religious awareness among the laity and clergy, Arundel and the next generation of northern clerks met the challenge of an increasing lay piety and the growing popularity of contemplative literature and the teachings of recluses. While bishop of Ely Arundel was patron of a number of northerners, including Richard Scrope, the future archbishop of York, John Newton, who became treasurer of York Minster, Henry Bowet (<i>d</i>. 1423), also a future archbishop of York, and Walter Hilton (<i>d</i>. 1396). These men, all Cambridge-educated canon lawyers, were employed by Arundel in the Ely consistory court, the most important instrument of diocesan administration. Yet they were also among the first students and readers of the mystical writings of their fellow Yorkshireman, Richard Rolle (<i>d</i>. 1349). Such men did not find it easy to reconcile the conflicting claims of spiritual aspiration and pastoral administration. Arundel himself, while preaching in 1394, expressed a desire to &#145;leve up his office of chaunceller and forsake the world&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 425, fol. 2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), while in 1409 he joined the Mount Grace fraternity.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, on the basis of an understanding of the spiritual problems of lay people acquired through pastoral work, Arundel and his servants were able to adapt the eremitical teachings of Rolle and his followers to the leading of a &#145;mixed life&#146;, combining action and contemplation. Less concerned with the dissemination of religious knowledge than with creating doctrinal and social orthodoxy out of the growing religious enthusiasm and independence of the period, they were able to impose structure and order on the piety of the north. The most striking expression of their outlook was the <span class="italic">Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ</span>. A paraphrase of the pseudo-Bonaventuran <span class="italic">Meditationes vitae Christi</span>, this was a biography of Christ that concentrated on the emotions to be found in human relationships. Nicholas Love presented this work to the archbishop in 1411 and it was approved by him for wider use.<br>
<br>Central to the furtherance of a socially responsible reaction to Christ's passion was devotion to the mass, and Arundel and his clerks placed special significance on the eucharist, and on the dignity and importance of the clergy in its celebration; this was set out in such pastoral manuals as John Burgh's <span class="italic">Pupilla oculi</span>. Arundel's own reverence for the host, noted by the St Albans chronicler in 1405, was based on a realization of its potential as a symbol of social harmony. He rebuked courtiers for turning their backs on the host when it was carried through the streets of Coventry, objecting to the antisocial implications of the increasingly private and austere religion of a group of courtiers of puritanical (and in Sir John Cheyne's case Lollard) sympathies, and contrasting it unfavourably to the great processions of the eucharist he had witnessed in the streets of Italian towns. In the <span class="italic">Treatise on the Eucharist</span>, appended to Nicholas Love's <span class="italic">Myrrour of the Blessed Lyf of Jesu Christ</span>, the host is seen as the earthly body of Christ within a community held together by the charity Christ showed in his passion.<br>
<br>Despite such provisions, there were anxieties over the way laymen and laywomen attempted to live like recluses without episcopal supervision and approval, simplifying and distorting the teachings of Rolle and his followers. Arundel's clerks examined self-appointed preachers. None the less, Arundel gave Margery Kempe a sympathetic hearing in 1413 in his garden at Lambeth Palace as she described to him her contemplative experiences and her gift of weeping. His approval was couched in the same language as used in Hilton's <span class="italic">Epistle on the Mixed Life</span>: he &#145;was ryght glad that owyr mercyful lord first schewyd swech grace in owre days&#146;  (Kempe, 37).<h2>
<a name="Opponentofheresy"></a>Opponent of heresy</h2>Arundel and his clerks also attempted to disentangle genuine piety from the new English Lollard heresy, as it developed from the 1380s onwards. A visitation of King's Hall, Cambridge, which Arundel made as bishop of Ely in July 1383, because of the negligence of the warden and general defects among scholars, may have been intended to forestall heresy in the college. He and his former Cambridge clerks were equally active against heresy, as an important part of their pastoral work, after they left Cambridge. Hilton's tract in defence of images reached its final form during his time at Thurgarton, and may have been used by Arundel, who imposed an oath on four Nottingham suspects in 1395 that &#145;From this day forward I shall worship images with prayers and offerings to them in worship of the saints that they be made after&#146;  (Wilkins, 3.225). Arundel and his followers countered Lollard emphasis on the written word by defending the use of images as books for illiterate laymen and as aids to devotion. When in 1407 he examined the iconoclast William Thorpe, Arundel was reported to have asked &#145;were it a fair thing to come into a church and see there none image&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. C.208, fol. 48<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Concerns about the dissemination of Lollard doctrine had been expressed in March 1395, when Arundel went to Ireland and requested the king to return as quickly as possible, to defend the church from Lollards whose twelve <span class="italic">Conclusions</span> had recently caused a stir during the Lent parliament. The archbishop began to be concerned about Lollard opinions in court circles when Sir John Cheyne (<i>d</i>. 1414) was appointed speaker of the House of Commons in October 1399. Addressing the Canterbury convocation, Arundel singled Cheyne out as one of a group of parliamentary knights hostile towards the church; and he encouraged the clergy to forestall anti-clerical attacks by promulgating measures against blatant forms of pluralism.<br>
<br>Arundel's subsequent response to the Lollard heresy was essentially <i>ad hoc</i>, meeting each threat from each new case of unlicensed preaching as it came up. In January 1401, opening the Canterbury convocation, he announced the main business was to tackle the problem of heresy among clergy and laity. William Sawtre, a priest and relapsed heretic, was brought before Arundel and convocation in February, and examined on his teaching on transubstantiation. After Sawtre refused to accept the church's authority on the matter, Arundel pronounced him a heretic, stripped him of his orders, and handed him over to the king in parliament. Heresy was now recognized as a crime against the state as well as the church. This was a test case in preparation for the trial of Nicholas Purvey on 28 February 1401. Purvey recanted forthwith. Yet only by a statute in March, <span class="italic">De haeretico comburendo</span>, was the death penalty ordained for heresy (Sawtre was executed by a retrospective application). No one was to preach without episcopal licence or produce a book that contradicted Catholic faith. All suspect books were to be surrendered to the diocesan bishop within forty days and obdurate heretics were to be handed over to the secular authorities for execution.<br>
<br>In 1407 Arundel interrogated a priest, William Thorpe. A lengthy and apparently authentic account by Thorpe survives. Arundel comes through as a surprisingly patient and humane interrogator, prepared to debate with Thorpe as an intellectual equal. Arundel pointed out that Lollards were greedy for worldly advancement, that Purvey's recantation secured a benefice and Philip Repyndon's a bishopric. To Thorpe's puritanical rejection of music and images as a distraction, Arundel gave an impassioned defence, arguing that pilgrims needed singers and pipers to keep up their spirits on a journey, and organs and good songs were better than sermons.<h2>
<a name="DealingswithOxford"></a>Dealings with Oxford</h2>In the conflict against heresy Oxford required special treatment. In the 1390s Arundel commissioned the fiercely orthodox William Woodford (<i>d</i>. 1397) to expound eighteen condemned passages from Wyclif's <span class="italic">Trialogus</span>, and in June 1397 Richard II upheld the right of the archbishop of Canterbury to visit the university. But Arundel continued to feel the need for comprehensive measures against Oxford, and in 1407 enacted a set of thirteen constitutions there. These remained operative for a year, before being finally promulgated at St Paul's on 14 January 1409 and the April following. Copies were forwarded to bishops and published in every diocese in England. They included such provisions as: no one was to preach without permission of the bishop of the diocese in which he was operating; every provost and warden in Oxford University was to conduct a monthly inquiry into what scholars were teaching and if it was contrary to the church they were to be expelled; schoolmasters were not to teach anything contrary to orthodox faith and scholars could not dispute matters of faith. A firm system of censorship was instituted. No works of Wyclif or anyone else were to be read in schools unless approved as orthodox; no one was to translate scripture into English on pain of excommunication, unless passed by a local bishop. Finally, in the summer of 1411, Arundel attempted to impose his authority on a defiant Oxford University. A hearing was held before the king, who endorsed Arundel's right of visitation, to imprison its proctors in the Tower of London and remove Richard Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1415) from his office of chancellor, and to have some scholars flogged.<br>
<br>This visitation of the university had been preceded by a public demonstration of the church's strong stand against heresy. At the opening of parliament on 27 January 1410 Arundel faced a House of Commons backing the prince of Wales's attacks on the royal prerogative and calling for disendowment of the church. Arundel succeeded in publicly putting the prince, whose close relationship with the House of Commons and friendship with the well-known heretic, Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417), implied an equivocal attitude to Lollard heresy, into a corner by bringing an obscure fanatic, the artisan, John Badby (who had been in prison for a year), to trial for denying transubstantiation. On 5 March, in St Paul's Cathedral, Arundel pronounced Badby guilty of heresy and of being in league with the devil, and handed him over to lay jurisdiction. The burning of Badby took place at Smithfield in the presence of the prince and Arundel. The prince, possibly in an attempt to subvert the proceedings, upstage Arundel, and regain some of the initiative he had lost towards an old opponent, interrupted the burning to offer Badby clemency and a pension if he recanted. Badby remained obdurate and the prince, for once outmanoeuvred and foiled, was forced to return the heretic to the flames. Arundel had succeeded in obtaining the prince's endorsement for the church's position on heresy; thereafter Henry was wholehearted in his support for the church. The new king's reign was therefore marked by Arundel's successful attempt to bring Henry V's friend, Oldcastle, to trial for heresy in September 1413. Arundel pressed Oldcastle on his views on transubstantiation and when he failed to convince the court of his orthodoxy the archbishop excommunicated him and handed him over to the secular power for burning. Oldcastle escaped to lead a rebellion against the king, and the successful suppression of this revolt on 13 January (seven of the thirty-eight men executed were burned as heretics) marked the new co-operation between Arundel and the king. At a service at St Paul's on 15 January before Henry V, Arundel offered litanies of intercession and prayers of thanksgiving.<h2>
<a name="Churchandstate"></a>Church and state</h2>A statesman&#150;bishop, Arundel directed a church to which the Lancastrian dynasty tied itself closely. He gave that dynasty his full support, claiming the revolution enjoyed divine approval and was divinely ordained, and so helping to enable Henry IV to claim the throne through &#145;that ryght that God of his grace hath sent me&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.422&#150;3). But Arundel also had strong reforming tendencies, and became increasingly independent of the papacy. His decision to break with the Roman pope, Gregory XII (<i>r</i>. 1406&#150;15), and to support the decision of the Council of Pisa to heal the papal schism by deposing Gregory and his Avignon counterpart, and electing a new incumbent, was as radical as anything Wyclif had proposed.<br>
<br>However, Arundel was also a vigorous and formidable defender of ecclesiastical liberties. The Lollard heresy was part of a larger trend of anti-clericalism in the late fourteenth century that affected members of the lay nobility. Henry IV could not meet his promises to reduce heavy lay taxation, raising the likelihood that he would exploit the wealth of the church. Arundel warned the Canterbury convocation, meeting at the same time as Henry's first parliament, that certain members of parliament were ill-disposed to the church. He lectured the king on the irreverence of his knights at the Coventry parliament of 1404. During this parliament the Commons proposed that crown lands granted to the church since 1366 should be returned, and knights of the king's entourage asserted that they had been fighting rebels and enemies of the king while the clergy were idle; Arundel retorted that the church gave tenths as often as the laity paid taxes; that its tenants were as active in military service; and that the clergy prayed and celebrated masses for the benefit of their secular brethren. When the speaker questioned the value of the church's prayers, Arundel asserted that the wish to seize the church's possessions stemmed from a questioning of the value of the church itself and he threatened any who did so with excommunication. The Commons capitulated.<br>
<br>Arundel's reputation as a churchman rests on the recovery of nerve that laid the foundations for the revival of the English church in the fifteenth century. The support that church could provide for an increasingly strong state was the basis for the achievements of Henry V. King and primate were alike reformers who were conservative and authoritarian by temperament. Arundel revitalized the church, restoring its prestige and authority; and after Badby's execution Henry V was to do the same as king. It was Arundel's securing the support of the state over the issue of heresy that laid the foundations of this achievement. The established church became an efficient organ of ecclesiastical discipline and inquisition. The principle of visiting the universities and supervising the nature of religious debate and education was established. Yet if the pastoral office was conceived in inquisitorial terms and control was exerted over the dissemination of religious literature, there was also a less punitive, positive dimension to Arundel's pastoral achievement. He was the patron and leader of a group of Cambridge-educated northern clergy who provided a pastoral alternative to Lollardy which, apart from its emphasis on <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading, was primarily a negative ideology defined largely in terms of its criticism of orthodox religion and its emphasis on the separation of its predestined elect followers from the rest of society. Arundel, besides giving an articulate defence of orthodox, ritualistic religion, prevented a collision between crown and clergy, during a time of heresy and costly foreign war, over the control of ecclesiastical wealth. It is probably significant that the Commons' proposals for a radical, confiscatory, solution to the issue of the church's contribution to national taxation came in the parliament of 1410, when Arundel's resignation as chancellor took place; even if the proposals were largely anti-clerical propaganda, they still illustrate the problems that confronted the head of the English church in this period.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>Arundel was a volatile and emotional man. He is reported to have shed tears on hearing of Scrope's execution and at Oldcastle's trial. He stormed against Master Richard Flemming, a university student, and four other Oxford scholars who dabbled in Wycliffite ideas, describing them as &#145;beardless blabbing boys&#146; and promised them, in a pun upon the Latin word <i>arundo</i> (&#145;a reed&#146;), that he was no &#145;Arundel shaken with the wind&#146;  (Wilkins, 3.322). A man of strong convictions, he saw himself as one chosen to defend the church against heresy, boasting to William Thorpe in 1407, &#145;God as I woot wel has clepid me agen and brought me into this lande for to distrie thee and the fals sect that thou art of, and bi god I schal pursue you unto a cle, so that I schal not leue oo stap of you in this lande&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. C.208, fol. 88<i>v</i>). Although he left Oxford as just a bachelor of arts, he was scholarly and civilized. During his exile he visited Rome and Florence. He confessed to Salutati that one of his main worries on returning to England was the fate of his library. Salutati promised to send him his treatise <span class="italic">De nobilitate legum et medicinae</span> and Arundel promised to lend the chancellor of Florence his copy of Augustine's treatise on music, <span class="italic">De musica ratione</span>.<br>
<br>For such an emotional, volatile man it is striking how successful Arundel was as a mediator, and it was his ability to compromise that enabled him to give such good service to both church and state, even if it may also have induced a sense of self-betrayal. Richard II used Arundel to secure the surrender of his brother, Earl Richard, in 1397, offering a safe conduct. It is unlikely Arundel was fooled again when in September 1399 he promised Richard at Flint that he would come to no harm. And in any case, even if Arundel was not present at Conwy, and did not think Bolingbroke was going to take the throne (though following his involvement in the events of 1386&#150;8 this possibility must have been often on his mind), he was still guilty of perjury in the sense that he told the estates of the realm that the king had not yielded under duress in London, but voluntarily and cheerfully at Conwy when he was at liberty; he was also behind, and subscribed to, the lies and propaganda that formed the preamble to the act and process of September 1399. This, and his failure to publish the sentence of excommunication against those responsible for killing his friend and fellow archbishop Richard Scrope, may explain the self-contempt expressed in his penitential will in 1414, when he described himself as a miserable sinner, an unworthy and lukewarm minister, and ordered a lowly funeral for his fetid, putrid cadaver. The parallels between this puritanical preamble and the wills of the Lollard knights, his friendship with the conscientious and austere (and former Wycliffite) Philip Repyndon, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1424), and his dedication to the educational role of the clergy, show that although his views diverged widely from those of Wyclif on essentials, Arundel at least shared the heresiarch's sense of pastoral duty and perhaps his sense of contrition. For his skills as a pragmatic mediator he probably paid a high personal price.<br>
<br>Thomas Arundel died on 19 February 1414, after a stroke which deprived him of the power of speech. His will, which must have been prepared well before, shows not only a preoccupation with penance and personal unworthiness, but also a concern for the provision of masses for his soul and for the distribution of his books; many of the latter were of a pastoral character, for instance a volume containing the complete works of St Gregory. He had been a notable benefactor of Canterbury Cathedral, being responsible for the completion of the nave (by 1405), and for the beginning of work on the north-west tower. And it was in the cathedral that he was buried, in a chapel erected under the third most easterly arch of the nave's north arcade. The spot was marked by a tomb chest carrying a brass. However, both tomb and chapel were destroyed by Archbishop Cranmer in 1540, apparently in belated revenge for Arundel's repression of heresy.<br>
