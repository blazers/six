<span class="headword">Baret,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, became a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1551, but then moved to Trinity College. He took the degree of BA in 1554&#150;5 and MA in 1558, and became a fellow of Trinity in 1560.<br>
<br>Baret's dictionary, <span class="italic">An Alvearie, or Triple Dictionarie, in Englyshe, Latin and French</span>, was published in 1574. The work was dedicated to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and the Cambridge scholar and linguist Sir Thomas Smith, and Alexander Nowell may have assisted with its expense. Others, such as &#145;Maister Powle, &amp; Maister Garth&#146;, also encouraged Baret to publish  (<span class="italic">Alvearie</span>, preface). Dedicatory verses were supplied by Richard Mulcaster and Arthur Golding, among others. Baret's preface mentions that he had been abroad &#145;for language and learning&#146;, and had also been &#145;conversant about the Innes of Court&#146;, where some former pupils had gone  (ibid.).<br>
<br>This was the third triple dictionary in English, the first having been published by John Veron in 1552 (Latin&#150;English&#150;French), and the second being John Higgins's revision of Richard Howlet or Huloet's dictionary (English&#150;Latin&#150;French). Baret's dictionary also contained a modest number of Greek equivalents. In the preface he explains that he taught Latin in Cambridge &#145;about eyghteene yeres agone&#146;, that is, about 1555, since the preface is dated 2 February 1574  (<span class="italic">Alvearie</span>, preface). The dictionary, he claims, was compiled from his and his students' notes by inverting the order to English&#150;Latin; it is actually largely based on Thomas Cooper's <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, as well as Robert Stephanus's <span class="italic">Dictionarium Latino-Gallicum</span>. Many other minor sources have been identified. Baret seems to have been teaching in London during work on the dictionary.<br>
<br>The term &#145;hard words&#146; (words too learned or obscure for ordinary readers), the basis of early monolingual English lexicography, first appeared in the prefatory material of Baret's <span class="italic">Alvearie</span>. He thought it best to concentrate on these hard words rather than familiar ones. The work has indexes and numbers for cross-reference in the main dictionary, so that the reader can find the equivalent of any Latin or French word. Baret also supplies grammatical information, gives indications of stress, and discusses spelling reform.<br>
<br>In 1577, shortly before his death, Baret was admitted MD at Cambridge, though there is no known evidence that he actually practised; he is described as &#145;Doctor in physick&#146; in his will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/60, sig. 38, fol. 293<i>v</i>). Legitimizing an existing medical practice by taking an MD degree much later was, however, a common practice.<br>
<br>Baret died in 1578 at some point between 6 October, when he drew up his will, and 31 October, when the will was proved, but not before revising the dictionary for a new edition, published in 1580, which considerably expanded the work, adding material from new sources, and greatly supplementing the Greek material. A dedication in this edition laments the author's recent death, and an elegiac by Mulcaster also appeared. Other contributors included Abraham Fleming and Thomas Speght.<br>
<br>Baret left his estate to his brother, Richard, also his executor. There is no indication of its extent; the only other bequest was &pound;20 to one Matthew Kenne in the event of his marriage to Baret's niece, Elizabeth. Neither wife nor children are mentioned.<br>
