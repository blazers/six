<span class="headword">Wakefield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bell]</span>,  Priscilla</span>  (1750&#150;1832), <span class="occ">author and philanthropist</span>, was born on 20 November 1750 in Tottenham, Middlesex, the eldest of six children of Catherine Barclay (1727&#150;1784) and Daniel Bell (1726&#150;1802), coal merchant. She was a great-granddaughter of the Quaker martyr Robert Barclay, author of <span class="italic">An Apology for the True Christian Divinity</span>; the maternal &#145;Barclay blood&#146; was said to have produced many strong women with force of character. Priscilla was raised in Stamford Hill, Tottenham High Cross, a semi-rural and prosperous Quaker centre 4 miles north of London. Educated at home under maternal supervision she learned Latin and Greek and, as the eldest daughter, she helped to teach her sisters; her brother recalled that they were considered &#145;a knot of clever women&#146;  (Bell, 40). On 3 January 1771, aged twenty, Priscilla married Edward Wakefield (1749&#150;1826), a merchant from a Quaker family with Irish connections. He inherited a business from his father in London, where he and Priscilla lived from 1771 to 1796. During that time three children were born to them: Isabella (1773&#150;1841), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28414/', "Edward Wakefield (1774&#150;1854)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28413/', "Daniel Wakefield (1776&#150;1846)")</script>. Having returned to Tottenham High Cross in 1796 the family lived at Ship Yard, in the High Street, for the next two decades. Grandchildren lived with them at various times, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28415/', "Edward Gibbon Wakefield")</script>. When scant family finances and health matters forced Priscilla and Edward to move in 1812 they found a haven near their daughter, Isabella Head, in Ipswich, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Wakefield wrote seventeen books, principally moral tales, introductory works of natural history, and travelogues. She was well known as an author for the rising generation at a time when the developing field of children's literature offered welcome opportunities to women. Her career began in the early 1790s, when she was more than forty years old and her husband's business was in difficulty; by the end of 1798 she had four books in print. Financial need and legal costs from the unhappy marital entanglements of both her sons led her to put pen to paper for the next twenty years. Proud of the fruits of her own industry she continued writing even when immediate business pressures eased. A busy writer who learned on the job, she published first with Elizabeth Newbery and Joseph Johnson, and then extensively with the Quaker firm of Darton and Harvey; many of her books also appeared in American editions.<br>
<br>Wakefield succeeded because she produced improving and didactic works of non-fiction that middle-class parents were choosing to buy. Unlike Romantic writings that celebrated imagination and fantasy Wakefield's books have a deliberate moral tone, are filled with information, and focus on real-life experiences in the present day. Characteristically they have a family setting and promote a new-style progressive pedagogy based in domestic conversations; mothers often teach their own children, and girls receive attention as much as boys. Wakefield's books were meant for reading in the home schoolroom but also for leisure. She shaped several age-specific miscellanies that combined moral tales and substantive knowledge. In <span class="italic">Mental Improvement, or, The Beauties and Wonders of Nature and Art</span> (3 vols., 1794&#150;7; 13th edn, 1828) children from the ages of nine to sixteen have evening conversations with their parents that serve as &#145;rational amusements&#146; and exemplify moderation, diligence, and toleration. In &#145;Conversation 12&#146; the father says, &#145;Endeavour, children, to increase your stock of useful knowledge daily, by attention to everything you see and hear&#146;  (p. 94). Their topics for discussion include whales, sugar, slavery, glassmaking, and woollen manufacture. Wakefield continued this successful and popular format in other books. <span class="italic">Domestic Recreation, or, Dialogues Illustrative of Natural and Scientific Subjects</span> (1805) features a mother and her daughters talking about such topics as the human eye, rainbows, and sea anemones. When the daughters wonder how to spend their time one rainy evening mother replies: &#145;None but the idle need want employment: there is always a great variety of pursuits, that are both useful and agreeable, for those who are disposed to fill their leisure properly&#146;  (p. 96).<br>
<br>Wakefield also wrote expository natural history books that are part of the Enlightenment history of disseminating science to new audiences. <span class="italic">An Introduction to Botany</span> (1796) is an account of Linnaean botany in the form of letters between sisters; in print until 1841 it was adapted for the American market and translated into French. Wakefield continued that successful format in <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Natural History and Classification of Insects</span> (1816). She was most widely known, however, as a pioneering travel writer for young readers. <span class="italic">The Juvenile Travellers</span> (1801; 19th edn, 1850) initiated a series of six books about an English family journeying around Europe to promote the general improvement of their children. Wakefield was only an armchair traveller but she did her research, cites sources, and includes maps. <span class="italic">A Family Tour through the British Empire</span> (1804; 15th edn, 1840) is replete with geographical details about England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Other books take the young people of the Middleton family around London and to America, Canada, Africa, and Asia.<br>
<br>Personally and politically Wakefield shied away from radicalism but she advocated reform in many areas of public and private life. Her books contain extended criticisms of the slave trade and cruelty to animals; letters to magazines weigh in on social topics such as the plight of apprentices and equal wages for women and men. Wakefield believed that education was the key to the improvement of individuals and society. In <span class="italic">Reflections on the Present Condition of the Female Sex</span> (1798; 2nd edn, 1817), her one book for an adult audience, she called for more educational and occupational opportunities for women. Advocating economic self-sufficiency she offered practical and vocational suggestions, such as establishing institutions to train teachers and encouraging women to be farmers. Wakefield did not contest the division of society into social classes; she directed her ideas about female improvement to women of the nobility, the middle classes, and the labouring poor. Nor did she contest gendered ideas about the &#145;female character&#146;. She wrote:<blockquote>There are many branches of science, as well as useful occupations, in which women may employ their time and their talents, beneficially to themselves and to the community, without destroying the peculiar characteristic of their sex, or exceeding the most exact limits of modesty and decorum. (P. Wakefield, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 8&#150;9)</blockquote>Nevertheless she worked hard to make the benefits of education available to all and was disappointed that a reviewer of <span class="italic">Reflections</span> thought her ideas applied only to women. Like Mary Wollstonecraft she believed that improvements in education and employment opportunities for women brought benefits to men as well.<br>
<br>The Friendly spirit of usefulness and social service that characterizes Wakefield's writing was evident in her philanthropic work on behalf of children, women, and the poor. Starting in 1791 she organized maternity charities to cover expenses for midwives and provide bags of linen to lying-in women. She supported the educational system of Quaker Joseph Lancaster for teaching reading and writing to the labouring poor, and regularly visited a school for the daughters of poor parishioners. In October 1798 she established a female benefit club at Tottenham High Cross to give pensions to the labouring poor at the age of sixty-five; honorary members paid 12<i>s</i>. annually and benefited members paid 6<i>d</i>. or more monthly, depending on their age. In that same year she formed a penny bank, into which children deposited &#145;any sum above one penny&#146;. She also established a &#145;frugality bank&#146; to encourage deposits from labourers and servants; the bank received sums above 1<i>s</i>. and gave 5 per cent interest for every 20<i>s</i>. held for one year. Because these philanthropic projects gave practical form to ideas that had been circulating in England at that time Wakefield can be considered the founder of the first English savings bank. In 1847 her son Edward organized a campaign to erect a monument to her as a founder of savings banks.<br>
<br>Priscilla Wakefield was a lifelong Quaker but disagreed with some Quaker habits of dress, language, and behaviour. &#145;True religion is of sterling value&#146;, she wrote in her journal for 27 June 1799, &#145;but I long to be set free from the slavish shackles of the prejudices of my infancy and the false lights of enthusiasm&#146;. She was spunky and resilient, and loved theatre and dancing. An engraved portrait shows a small woman with a lively and direct gaze. Oral tradition records that when their house caught fire her husband, who was given to &#145;hysterics&#146; in times of stress, fled to a corner in tears and she, &#145;with her usual energy&#146;, organized the rescue efforts.<br>
<br>Illness, increasing lameness, invalidism, and widowhood characterized the final years of Wakefield's long life. She died at her daughter's home, Albion Hill, Carr Street, in Ipswich, on 12 September 1832 and was buried on 20 September in the Quaker burial-ground of the New Meeting-House in Ipswich.<br>
