<span class="headword">Simpson,  James</span>  (1781&#150;1853), <span class="occ">advocate and author</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the son of William Simpson, minister of the Tron Church, Edinburgh, and his wife, Jean Douglas Balderston. His grandfather James, and great-grandfather John Simpson were also ministers of the Church of Scotland. James was called to the bar in 1801. In early life he was acquainted with Sir Walter Scott, and was among those to whom <span class="italic">Waverley</span> was submitted for criticism before publication.<br>
<br>In 1815 Simpson visited Waterloo immediately after the defeat of the French, and then proceeded to Paris, at that time in the hands of the allies. In the same year he published a vivid description of the scenes in the neighbourhood of the battlefield, entitled <span class="italic">A Visit to Flanders and the Field of Waterloo</span> (1815), which rapidly went through nine editions. In 1853 he published an account of his experiences in Paris, under the title <span class="italic">Paris after Waterloo</span>, which included a tenth edition of his earlier work. His impressions of Paris are interesting, and include some recollections of Sir Walter Scott. In 1823 Simpson was associated with George Combe and his brother in establishing the <span class="italic">Phrenological Journal</span>, to which he was a constant contributor until it ceased to appear in 1847.<br>
<br>Simpson took a deep interest in the movement for better elementary education. He was one of the founders of the Edinburgh modern infant school, in which he attempted to solve the problem of religious education by allowing parents to select religious instructors themselves. Failing to receive adequate support, however, the school was ultimately sold to the kirk session of New Greyfriars. Simpson continued devoted to the cause of non-sectarian education, and lectured on the subject throughout Britain. In 1837 he appeared as a witness before the House of Commons select committee on education, and his examination lasted seven days. He expressed his views on the need for educational reform in several publications including <span class="italic">The Necessity of Popular Education as a National Object</span> (1834), and <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Education</span> (1836). He also wrote <span class="italic">Hints on the Principles of a Constitutional Police</span> (1822), and <span class="italic">The State of the Representation of Edinburgh in Parliament</span> (1824). Simpson died on 2 September 1853, at his house, 33 Northumberland Avenue, Edinburgh.<br>
