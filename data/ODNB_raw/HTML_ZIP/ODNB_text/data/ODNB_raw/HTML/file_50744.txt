<span class="headword">Macpherson,  Annie Parlane</span>  (1825&#150;1904), <span class="occ">promoter of child emigration</span>, was born on 2 June 1825 in Campsie, by Milton, Stirlingshire, and baptized there on 26 June 1825, the eldest of the seven children of James Macpherson (<i>d</i>. 1851), a shoemaker, teacher, and member of the Society of Friends, and his wife, Helen Edwards. She was educated in Glasgow and trained in Froebel's educational methods at the Home and Colonial Training College, London. When her father was appointed superintendent of the Ockham Industrial Schools, Surrey, she acted as his secretary. At the age of nineteen she experienced a religious conversion, possibly connected to the tragic death of her fianc&eacute;. Influenced by the revivalist Reginald Radcliffe, she was inspired to undertake evangelical work among the coprolite diggers in Eversden, Cambridgeshire, where she lived from 1858. In 1865 she moved to London. Here she met Clara Lowe and Lady Rowley, who introduced her to mission work in the East End among the young female matchbox makers, whose plight she highlighted in <span class="italic">The Little Matchbox-Makers</span> (1866). Following an invitation from the Society of Friends to give lectures at the Bedford Institute, she included boys in her rescue mission. She opened a series of &#145;Revival Homes&#146;, named after the evangelical newspaper whose readers supported them, and in 1868 the Home of Industry, at 60 Commercial Street, was acquired to offer work, food and shelter, and basic education and religious instruction.<br>
<br>By 1869 Annie Macpherson had become convinced that emigration was the answer to chronic unemployment, and the Home of Industry assisted 500 people to emigrate to Canada. On a visit to the United States in 1866 she had met charity workers who assisted destitute New York children to move out west, and she adopted a similar plan to send children to homes in rural Canada, a project she outlined in <span class="italic">The Christian</span>. Sufficient funds were raised for 100 boys to leave for Canada in May 1870. They were accompanied by Annie Macpherson and by Ellen Bilborough, who remained in charge of the Canadian home established at Marchmont, Belleville, Ontario. In 1871 further homes were opened in Ontario at Galt and Knowlton.<br>
<br>Annie Macpherson's homes acted as distributing homes for several other charities, including those of Dr Thomas Barnardo, who had worked with the children at the Home of Industry in its earliest years, and William Quarrier, whom she encouraged to open children's homes in Scotland. When the emigration of poor-law children was approved in 1871 she was also invited by boards of guardians to place pauper children. By 1893, 5730 boys and girls had emigrated through her homes.<br>
<br>Pauper emigration was suspended in 1875 following a critical report by Andrew Doyle to the Local Government Board. It revealed shortcomings in the training and supervision of the children placed by Annie Macpherson and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35896/', "Maria Rye")</script>, another important figure involved in the emigration of children. Their organizations operated in parallel, but their approach was very different and they never co-operated. Maria Rye had the ear of establishment figures and appealed for funds through <span class="italic">The Times</span>; Annie Macpherson believed in the power of prayer and received donations in response to letters and reports published in <span class="italic">The Christian</span>. Of the two, Annie Macpherson was the less controversial figure, and her operation was larger, more efficient, and more sympathetic to the children in her care. Although she was less well known in her day, Annie Macpherson's contribution to the history of juvenile emigration was arguably more influential.<br>
<br>An important element of Annie Macpherson's evangelical mission was the training of young Christian workers who helped at the Home of Industry and preached in the East End on Sundays. She established the Bridge of Hope refuge for women, was involved in many other missions, and for more than twenty-five years held a weekly sewing meeting for poor widows. Her sisters were closely involved in her work; Rachel Merry and her family were associated with the Canadian homes, and Louisa Birt ran the Liverpool Sheltering Home. The Macpherson homes were ultimately absorbed into Dr Barnardo's.<br>
<br>Annie Macpherson was a good-looking, warm-hearted woman with a magnetic personality and the power to inspire others. She also &#145;had her sting and used it, not always wisely, and sometimes too well&#146;  (Lowe, 235). She retired in 1902 to Hove, Sussex, where she died at her home, 9 Sackville Road, on 27 November 1904 from bronchitis. A service was held at the Home of Industry, 29 Bethnal Green Road, and she was buried on 3 December 1904 in the City of London cemetery, Ilford, Essex.<br>
