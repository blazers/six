<span class="headword">Widdrington, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1664), <span class="occ">politician and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest son of Lewis Widdrington (<i>d</i>. 1630) of Cheeseburn Grange, Stamfordham, Northumberland, who was the &#145;base-begotten&#146; scion of a venerable Northumbrian family. Widdrington's mother was Catherine, daughter and heir of William Lawson of Little Usworth, co. Durham. The scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29355/', "Ralph Widdrington")</script> was a younger brother. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in April 1617, and graduated BA at Easter 1620. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 14 February 1619, called to the bar in 1625, and from 1625 to 1631 reported cases in the court of king's bench. In January 1632 he was appointed recorder of Berwick upon Tweed upon the recommendation of Sir John Fenwick, and in 1633 delivered a loyal speech to the king, who had stopped in the town on his way to Scotland. The following year Widdrington married Frances (1612&#150;1649), daughter of Sir Ferdinando (later second baron) Fairfax, with whom he had six children. Through this alliance he became linked with the Fairfax family's wide network of friends and kinsmen in Yorkshire, which included Thomas, Viscount Wentworth (the future earl of Strafford). In April 1637 Widdrington was appointed recorder of York upon the recommendation of Sir Richard Hutton, and on 30 March 1639 delivered another fulsome address to the king in which he referred to the Scottish covenanters as &#145;rebels&#146;  (Johnson and Bell, 1.348). He was knighted two days later. That same year he was retained as a counsellor-at-law by Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland, who commanded Charles's navy in the first bishops' war, and was on close terms with both Wentworth and the Fairfaxes. He also became a bencher and ancient at Gray's Inn in 1639, and on 10 November 1641 was appointed the society's treasurer.<br>
<br>Widdrington was elected MP for Berwick on 11 March 1640, and contributed to several of the debates in the Short Parliament, usually to clarify legal points. In the autumn he stood for election at York as Strafford's nominee, but was rejected by the corporation. He was returned again for Berwick on 3 October. Though never prominent in debate he was one of the most active members of the Long Parliament. Before Pride's Purge he was nominated to almost 300 committees, made numerous reports to the house, managed twenty-three conferences, and was entrusted with drafting almost sixty bills and ordinances. One of his first tasks was to help prepare the Commons case against his former patron, Strafford. He also played a leading role in the attack on the new canons and the Laudian episcopate, and was named to numerous committees for godly reformation and the suppression of recusancy. Having drawn up the articles of impeachment against Bishop Wren, he presented them to the Lords on 20 July 1641, with a &#145;smart, aggravating speech&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.350) in which he accused Wren of suspending &#145;painful ministers&#146; and of introducing &#145;dead and venomous ceremonies&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary &hellip; History</span>, 9.492, 493). When Charles arrived at York in March 1642 Widdrington was reportedly on hand with an address urging the king &#145;with great boldnesse and vehemencie&#146; to &#145;condescend unto &hellip; Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Kings Entertainment at Yorke</span>, fol. 3/63). Over the next few months he helped to forward parliament's military preparations, but after being granted leave of absence on 22 July did not return to the house for two years. He spent much of the intervening period in royalist-held York, where he advised the corporation in its dealings with the royalist commander, the earl of Newcastle. In February 1643 he addressed the queen on her arrival at York, urging her to &#145;bend herselfe, with all her faculties, to a peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 7&#150;14 March 1643, 86, BL, E 93/6). His abandonment of parliament may have stemmed from hostility towards inviting in the Scottish covenanters&#151;a scheme mooted in senior parliamentary circles since 1642. Once the solemn league and covenant had been agreed, however, he may have come to regard Scottish intervention as a necessary evil in reclaiming the north for parliament and counterbalancing the king's use of Irish troops.<br>
<br>Widdrington was readmitted to the Commons on 3 June 1644, and three days later chaired a committee of the whole house concerning the Westminster assembly rules of ordination. He figured prominently in parliament's efforts to settle a godly ministry, and was added to the committee for plundered ministers in November 1644. Through his chairmanship of the northern committee and its successor, the northern association committee (the Commons' standing committees for northern affairs) he also played a major role in sustaining the parliamentarian war effort. Similarly, he was a key figure in the establishment and maintenance of the New Model Army, under his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and on 8 May 1645 was added to the committee for the army. His links with the Fairfaxes and apparent dislike of the Scots inclined him strongly towards the anti-Scottish, &#145;Independent&#146; faction at Westminster, of which Northumberland was a leading member. Perhaps his greatest service to this group was as chairman of the committee of the whole house that drew up the Newcastle propositions over the winter of 1645&#150;6. These were correctly perceived by the Scots as a repudiation of their confederalist terms for settlement in Britain and Ireland.<br>
<br>Appointed a parliamentary commissioner to the army on 12 June 1647, Widdrington was at Fairfax's headquarters when presbyterian rioters &#145;forced&#146; the two houses late in July, and probably returned to Westminster with the New Model Army early in August. His continuing alignment with the Independents is suggested by his appointment in March 1648 as a commissioner of the great seal&#151;the new commissioners allegedly being chosen &#145;by the private junto of Cromwell's party beforehand&#146;  (Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 2.277). According to his friend and fellow commissioner Bulstrode Whitelocke, Widdrington was far less reluctant to accept the post than he was himself. On 12 October Widdrington was raised to the degree of serjeant-at-law and made one of the king's serjeants. By this stage, however, he was troubled by the increasingly radical turn of army politics, and though he and Whitelocke retained their seats at Pride's Purge, they were &#145;sad to see such doings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 225), and had &#145;no great mind to sit in the House &hellip; as it was then constituted&#146;  (Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 2.478). At Cromwell's urging&#151;he having consulted the two men and William Lenthall on 18 and 21 December&#151;they attempted to devise a moderate settlement that would be agreeable to the army, and on 23 December they took part in a fruitless conference at the speaker's house about &#145;settling the kingdom by the Parliament, and not to leave all to the sword&#146;  (Whitelocke, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 2.481).<br>
<br>The two men resolved to have nothing to do with Charles's trial and decided to retire to Whitelocke's house in the country for its duration. Nevertheless, they attended the house on 8 and 23 January 1649, and took the &#145;dissent&#146;, the repudiation of the December vote to continue negotiations with Charles, used as a test for continued membership, just two days after the king's execution. On 8 February they were appointed commissioners of the great seal, but at this point Widdrington's scruples finally got the better of him and he declined the post on grounds of conscience. In respect of his former services he was allowed to practise within the bar and voted an extra quarter's salary. He was named to just thirty committees in the Rump, many of them to do with legal reform or northern affairs. He was appointed serjeant for the Commonwealth on 6 June 1650, and a councillor of state on 10 February 1651. At a meeting called by Cromwell late in 1651 to discuss the settlement of government he advocated some form of monarchy, suggesting the duke of Gloucester as king. On 19 April 1653, at a conference at Whitehall, he spoke strongly against the army's intention of dissolving the Rump.<br>
<br>Regarded by Cromwell's court as a &#145;very serviceable&#146; man  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 5.196), Widdrington was made a commissioner of the great seal on 4 April 1654 and a treasury commissioner the following August. In summer 1654 he was returned MP for York, and supported the Cromwellian interest at Westminster. He faced another moral dilemma in 1655 over the bill for reforming the chancery. Like Whitelocke he regarded the bill as detrimental to the public interest and his oath of office. While insisting that they were &#145;very unhappy not to satisfy his Highness&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655</i>, 152), the two men refused to execute the ordinance and on 8 June they were removed from office. Widdrington retained Cromwell's favour, however, being appointed chancellor of the county palatine of Durham on 3 September 1655. In summer 1656 he was returned MP for both York and Northumberland, and opted to sit for the latter. When parliament assembled on 17 September, John Lisle moved that Widdrington be made speaker, as a &#145;person of great integrity and experience &hellip; and every way qualified for that service&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 7.423). In fact he proved a poor choice&#151;he was often indecisive, showed a poor grasp of procedure, and was frequently indisposed through ill health. He acquitted himself better on large ceremonial occasions, as, for example, in his speech to Cromwell on 23 January 1657, congratulating him on his deliverance from Sindercombe's plot. His address to Cromwell on 31 March at the presentation of &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146; was &#145;at once grave and eloquent and long and prolix&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1657&#150;9</i>, 37). He urged Cromwell to accept the crown, arguing that it was &#145;well-known to the nation, agreeable to their constitutions, and necessary to the temperament of the people&#146;  (ibid.). He repeated this exhortation in similar addresses on 8 April and 25 May. The high point of his speakership came on 26 June, when he presided at Cromwell's investiture as protector. Exactly a year later he was appointed lord chief baron of the exchequer. He was active in the restored Rump in 1659&#150;60, and was nominated to both the December 1659 and the February 1660 councils of state. On 18 January 1660 he was transferred from the court of exchequer to the post of principal commissioner of the great seal.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Widdrington lost all the offices and honours that he had gained since the civil war but he was restored to the post of serjeant-at-law on 1 June 1660, and appointed temporal chancellor of the bishopric of Durham on 21 December. He was returned for Berwick and York to the Convention Parliament, and chose the latter seat. He was among those MPs thought to favour a presbyterian church settlement and imposing restrictions on the king's prerogative as the price of his restoration. He also moved (unsuccessfully) that former royalists or their sons be expelled from the house. He was returned for Berwick to the Cavalier Parliament, but by that stage he had effectively retired from public life. He resigned as recorder of York in December 1661, having given up the recordership of Berwick in 1658. He died on 13 May 1664, and was buried in the chancel of St Giles-in-the-Fields, near his wife and his daughter Dorothy, three days later. His only son, Thomas, had died at The Hague in May 1660, and thus Widdrington's Northumberland estate, valued at &pound;800 per annum, passed to his brother Henry. The rest of his property, which was mainly in Yorkshire, was divided among his four surviving daughters. Despite receiving large salaries in his various employments during the interregnum, he died with debts of &pound;2350. The royalist Sir Philip Warwick sums him up as &#145;a good lawyer, but naturally a cautious and timorous man&#146;  (P. Warwick, <span class="italic">Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I</span>, 1701, 381). Widdrington wrote, in or about 1660, &#145;Analecta Eboracensia&#146;, a description and history of York, which remained unpublished until the nineteenth century when it appeared in 1897, edited by C. Caine.<br>
