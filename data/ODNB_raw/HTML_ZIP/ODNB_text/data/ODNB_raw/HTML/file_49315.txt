<span class="headword">Leese, Sir  William Hargreaves</span>, second baronet  (1868&#150;1937), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at Send Holme, Send, near Guildford, Surrey, on 24 August 1868, the eldest son of Sir Joseph Francis Leese, first baronet (1845&#150;1914), cotton spinner and later recorder of Manchester (1893&#150;1914) and MP for Accrington (1892&#150;1910), and his wife, Mary Constance Hargreaves (<i>d</i>. 1928). He was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1887&#150;90), where he developed a keen interest in cricket and acting, which he retained for the rest of his life. His own desire was for a military career but instead he followed his father's wishes and became a barrister of the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar in 1893, the year in which he married Violet Mary Sandeman (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of Albert George Sandeman (1833&#150;1923), head of the Sandeman drinks business (1868&#150;1923), a director of the Bank of England (1868&#150;1918), and its governor (1895&#150;7). There were three sons and a daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>In his early years at the bar, Leese forged his own link with the Bank of England through its solicitors, Freshfields, who instructed him as junior to Sir Charles Matthews in a number of prosecutions for forgery. A closer connection was offered to Leese when Freshfields invited him to join them as a partner, an invitation he accepted. He was disbarred, admitted a solicitor, and became a partner in Freshfields in 1906.<br>
<br>From the beginning Leese worked, as intended, on Bank of England matters which had been, since 1819, always conducted by a member of the Freshfield family. Dr Edwin Freshfield, who had recruited him, was senior partner of the firm and was at this time in his seventies. Neither his son, Edwin Hanson Freshfield, nor his nephew James William Freshfield, though both partners in the firm, had shown the interest in or dedication to the practice of law of the family's three previous generations. Following the death of Dr Freshfield in 1918 and the retirement from practice of his son in 1921, Leese became the senior partner of the firm. He succeeded his father as second baronet in 1914.<br>
<br>Under Sir William's leadership the firm was modernized. The telephone was brought out of the basement, a lift was installed, and considerable refurbishment of the offices at 31 Old Jewry (which the firm had occupied since 1898) was carried out. Sir William's own room, with its handsome mahogany desk, thick carpet, and walls hung with choice watercolours, was apparently much admired in the City&#151;such tasteful luxury being at that time unusual in the offices of City solicitors. He had style; Sir Godfey Morley of Allen and Ovary recalled (in 1978) a visit to Freshfields in the 1930s when he was an articled clerk: &#145;It was a hot summer's day and Sir William was sitting without his jacket (unusual in those days) wearing a most beautiful silk shirt&#146;  (Morley, 9).<br>
<br>From 1914 to 1930 Sir William bore sole responsibility for the Bank of England's legal work. This included acting for the trustees of the loans developed to ease the payment of German reparations, and for the Securities Management Trust which held the bank's interest in the merged firms of Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co. and Vickers Ltd. In the 1930s, as the bank's involvement in industrial organization became greater and Sir William also became involved in the international loans made to Austria and Hungary under the auspices of the League of Nations, other Freshfield partners were appointed to take on parts of the bank's work. In 1935 Leslie Peppiatt was recruited from the British American Tobacco Company to understudy Sir William's work for the bank.<br>
<br>Despite such a busy professional life&#151;and Sir William was an active member of the Council of the Law Society&#151;for many years he found time to give free legal advice at Cambridge House in the East End and to take an interest in the Boy Scout movement. He was widely respected in the City and beyond, not least for his ability to find solutions to difficult problems with common sense, tact, and friendliness.<br>
<br>Sir William's sporting interests encompassed golf, horse-racing, and dry-fly-fishing as well as cricket. His enthusiasm for the stage never faltered and he continued to participate in the dramatic productions of the Old Stagers and the Windsor Strollers. He died suddenly of heart failure on 17 January 1937 while on holiday at the Victoria Hotel, Sidmouth, Devon. He was succeeded as third baronet by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31346/', "Oliver William Hargreaves Leese")</script>.<br>
