<span class="headword">Cooke, Sir  George</span>  (1768&#150;1837), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son and heir of George John Cooke of Harefield, Middlesex, and his wife, Penelope, only daughter of Sir William Bowyer, third baronet; he was a grandson of George Cooke (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1768), protonotary of the court of common pleas and MP for Middlesex from 1750 to 1768, and great-grandson of Sir George Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1740) of Harefield, protonotary of the court of common pleas. The naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6158/', "Edward Cooke (1772&#150;1799)")</script> was one of his two brothers. His second sister, Penelope Anne, married Robert Brudenell, sixth earl of Cardigan, and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3765/', "James Thomas Brudenell, seventh earl")</script>. Cooke was educated at Harrow School, and at Caen in Normandy. He was appointed ensign in the 10th foot guards in 1784, and lieutenant and captain in 1792. In March 1794 he joined the flank battalion of the guards in Flanders, and in June was appointed aide-de-camp to Major-General Samuel Hulse. He was present when the combined armies took the field and attacked the French posts in April, in the actions of 17 and 18 May, and at the affair at Boxtel on 15 September. In 1795 he joined the brigade of guards at Darley camp and became aide-de-camp to Major-General Edmund Stevens. In 1798 he was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel in his regiment, and in August 1799 he went with it to the Netherlands. He was present in the action at the Zuype on 10 September, and in the battle on 19 September, when he was severely wounded.<br>
<br>From 1803 until the spring of 1805 Cooke was assistant adjutant-general in the north-west district. In 1806 he went to Sicily, returning to England in December 1807. On 25 April 1808 he received the brevet rank of colonel, and in July 1809 he was employed in the expedition to the Schelde, from where he returned sick in September.<br>
<br>In April 1811 Cooke went to Cadiz, and on 4 June attained the rank of major-general, and succeeded to the command of the troops stationed there, which he retained until his return to England in July 1813. In November he returned to the Netherlands with the brigade of guards. He commanded the 1st division of the guards at Waterloo, and lost his right arm in the battle. He was appointed KCB on 22 June 1815, and colonel of the 77th foot on the following day. He also received for his share in the engagement the order of St George of Russia (third class) and the order of Wilhelm of the Netherlands (third class).<br>
<br>On 20 October 1819 Cooke was appointed lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth, a post which he resigned a few years later. On 19 July 1821 he obtained the rank of lieutenant-general, and on 23 December 1834 he was transferred to the command of the 40th regiment. His health was shattered by his military career, and he died of influenza, unmarried, at his house, Harefield Park, Harefield, Middlesex, on 3 February 1837. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, &#145;the poor of the village have lost in him a most benevolent and kind-hearted friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 657).<br>
