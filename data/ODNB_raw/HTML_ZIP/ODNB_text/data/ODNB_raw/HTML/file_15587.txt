<div class="para">
<span class="headword">King, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1730&#150;1806), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Gosport, Hampshire, on 10 August 1730, the third but first surviving son of Curtis King (<i>d</i>. 1745), master in the navy and afterwards master-attendant at Woolwich Dockyard, and Mary (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1700&#150;<i>c</i>.1750), daughter of Lieutenant Benjamin Barnett RN (<i>d</i>. 1703), and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1477/', "Commodore Curtis Barnett")</script>.<br>
<br>King entered the navy in 1738 on the <i>Berwick</i> (70 guns), of which his father was master, but he was soon moved to the <i>Dragon</i> (60 guns), commanded by his uncle, Barnett, whom he accompanied to the Mediterranean. He returned to England in the summer of 1742. In March 1744 he joined Barnett in the <i>Deptford</i> (60 guns), and in January 1745 took part in the capture of three French East-Indiamen in the Strait of Banca, which the governor of Batavia bought for &pound;92,000. Probably as a result of this action King was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1745. Other prizes followed before Barnett reached Madras where he died in April 1746. King returned to England at the end of the war, but in 1754 he again went to the East Indies, as lieutenant of the <i>Tiger</i> (60 guns), from which he was moved by the commander-in-chief, Rear-Admiral Charles Watson into the flagship <i>Kent</i> (70 guns) as first lieutenant. King was thus at the taking and destruction of the pirate stronghold of Gheria in February 1756, capturing stores, money and valuables to the value of approximately &pound;130,000; and on 23 July 1756 he was promoted commander of the fireship <i>Blaze</i>, bought by the admiral the previous day. Unfortunately the <i>Blaze</i> sprang a leak and was sent to Bombay for repairs so that King was merely a volunteer, though an active one, in the capture of Calcutta Fort in December 1756.<br>
<br>King took an equally active part and commanded the boats and landing party at the capture of the city of Hooghly, 30 miles north of Calcutta, on 10 January 1757. His courage and promptitude pleased Watson who, in February, as a mark of favour, sent him home with dispatches, in the sloop <i>Pilot</i>, with a strong recommendation to Earl Temple, the first lord of the Admiralty. King made an exceptionally swift passage, never stopping until he reached England in July 1757. The first lord, now Lord Anson, appreciative of zeal and activity in an officer, immediately ordered King to the West Indies in the sloop <i>Bonetta</i>, from which he was posted, by Commodore John Moore, to the frigate <i>Rye</i> (24 guns) on 29 January 1759. Moore's squadron, reinforced in January 1759 for an attack on the French islands, made an unsuccessful attack on Martinique but captured Guadeloupe in May. In that month King was moved to the <i>Ludlow Castle</i> (40 guns) and sent home with a convoy; and in the following January he was appointed to the frigate <i>Argo</i> (28 guns), in which he cruised with some success on the coast of France and in the North Sea.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war with Spain in 1762 an attack on the Philippines was planned and King was chosen to convey General Draper to the East Indies, where he arrived in June. He took part in the expedition to Manila, which set sail on 6 October, and on 31 October, with Captain Hyde Parker, he captured the <i>Santissima Trinidad</i>, an immensely rich galleon from Manila. Parker and King had hoped to take the annual Acapulco galleon, the <i>Santa Philippina</i>, but, missing her, had chanced on an almost equally golden prize. The total prize money was estimated at $3 million (more than &pound;600,000), and King's personal share was more than &pound;30,000. In 1763 he returned, with the galleon, to England, commanding the <i>Grafton</i> (68 guns). It was this fortune and the consequent rise in status which enabled him, on 30 November 1769, to marry Susannah Margaretta Coker (<i>d</i>. 1794), daughter of William Coker of Mappowder, Dorset. The couple had three daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15589/', "Richard King")</script>, naval officer.<br>
<br>During the Falklands crisis with Spain in 1770 King commanded the <i>Northumberland</i> (68 guns). Following a series of short-term commands in early 1778 he was appointed to the <i>Pallas</i> (36 guns) in which he convoyed the Quebec trade to Canada; he then formed part of a successful expedition, with Commodore John Evans, against the French islands of St Pierre and Miquelon, before returning to England in command of the <i>Europe</i> (64 guns). In January 1779 he was appointed to the <i>Exeter</i> (64 guns), part of Sir Edward Hughes's squadron which sailed in March for the East Indies and captured the French west African trading station of Goree <i>en route</i>. On arrival King was ordered to wear a broad pennant as an established commodore and second in command. Thereafter he was at the taking of Negapatam in November 1781 and of Trincomalee from the Dutch in January 1782, and in all Hughes's actions with the French commander Suffren. In that off Sadras, 17 February 1782, the <i>Exeter</i> was the rearmost ship of the English line. For some time she was attacked by four French ships and severely mauled, being almost entirely dismasted, receiving several shot below the waterline, and having ten men killed and 47 wounded. As the flag captain, Reynolds, was killed, his brains were dashed in King's face, temporarily blinding him. The master, seeing two more enemy ships bearing down on the <i>Exeter</i>, asked what they should do. Wiping his face with his handkerchief, King replied, &#145;There is nothing to be done but to fight her till she sinks&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). A lucky shift of wind, however, allowed the British van to tack to the assistance of their rear, the <i>Exeter</i> was rescued by the <i>Hero</i>, and the French withdrew. The other actions between Hughes and Suffren were on 12 April, 6 July, and 3 September 1782&#151;in this last the <i>Exeter</i> was again engaged by four French ships&#151;and 20 June 1783. The <i>Exeter</i> played a distinguished part in all these naval battles, having a total of 178 men killed and wounded. King himself was unhurt, though in the action of 20 June a shot struck the speaking trumpet out of his hand. So badly damaged was the <i>Exeter</i> that, on the passage home with nine sail of the line, she was condemned at the Cape of Good Hope as unseaworthy, and King moved to the <i>Hero</i> for the remainder of the passage. He arrived in England in May 1784, and was knighted on 2 June.<br>
<br>Peace brought unemployment, but on 24 September 1787 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white. In September 1789 he applied to William Pitt for a baronetcy, &#145;in consideration of long and faithful service at sea and a firm attachment to his Majesty's person and government&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 4.337). On 24 June 1790 he wrote again, urging his attachment to the present government, in the recent election. King had gone to Portsmouth to vote for the government candidate, despite a fever. Ignoring both comfort and dignity he made the journey from the Downs in the sloop <i>Wasp</i> &#145;because the captain had a vote for the county, that he might be in a convenient situation to attend the election&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Whether this was decisive or not, King was promoted rear-admiral of the red on 21 September 1790 and commander-in-chief at the Downs. In the mobilization of the fleet at Spithead in 1791 he was given a junior command in the <i>St George</i>. He was made a baronet on 18 July 1792 and appointed governor and commander-in-chief at Newfoundland until 1794. In the same year he was returned unopposed as MP for Rochester. King is reputed to have spent about &pound;5000 in these elections, and on standing again in May 1796, when he won handsomely, he referred to his exertions on behalf of his constituents, but he made no impact in the Commons and retired in 1802.<br>
<br>King had repeatedly applied to Pitt for promotion and in 1796 he made an unsuccessful application for the governorship of Greenwich Hospital. Having become vice-admiral of the red in July 1793, he was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 June 1795, admiral of the white on 14 February 1799, and finally admiral of the red on 9 November 1805. This was a considerable achievement for someone of King's social background, and illustrates how connections, courage, and luck could make a naval career the path to professional and social advancement. King's naval career had been distinguished and lucrative. He invested in East India Company stock and at his death was worth approximately &pound;35,000. He died on 27 November 1806 at his London house, 39 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, and was buried at Marylebone church on 4 December.<br>
