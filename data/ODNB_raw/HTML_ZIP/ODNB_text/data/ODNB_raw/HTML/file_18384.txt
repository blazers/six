</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maurice,  (John) Frederick Denison</span>  (1805&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born at Normanton, near Lowestoft, on 29 August 1805, the fifth child and only son of Michael Maurice and his wife, Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurry, daughter of a Yarmouth merchant. Michael Maurice was preparing for the dissenting ministry at an academy at Hackney, Middlesex, when a shift in his opinions led him to Unitarianism, a decision which cost him the inheritance of an estate. In 1792 he was elected evening preacher at the Unitarian chapel in Hackney where Joseph Priestley preached in the mornings. Two years later he married, residing at Normanton until 1812, when he moved first to Clifton, and then, in the following year, to Frenchay, near Bristol. Besides Frederick, the family now consisted of seven sisters, three older and four younger than he, as well as a nephew and a niece of Mrs Maurice. The deaths of the two latter, on 18 October 1814 and 3 January 1815 respectively, greatly affected the elder sisters, to the extent indeed of bringing about a change in their religious convictions from Unitarianism to Calvinism. The eldest, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1795), joined the Church of England, whereas the third, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1799), became a Baptist. Eventually their mother also embraced the Calvinistic doctrine. Unfortunately the religious persuasions which thus divided the family gave rise to vehement disagreement. That the young Frederick was confused and distressed by these disputes is of little wonder, and as he came to understand how matters stood he began to sense that need for religious unity which was to be a guiding principle of all his subsequent thinking. It likewise left him with the impression that, as he afterwards put it, &#145;a society merely united in opinion has no real cohesion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.276).<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Maurice's education and upbringing by his father were on puritanical lines: reading novels was not, in the main, allowed; <span class="roman">Bible</span> study was insisted upon. He appears to have been an exemplary child, responsive to teaching and always dutiful. He read a good deal on his own account, but had little inclination for games. Serious and precocious, he even at this time harboured ambitions for a life of public service.<br>
<br>In 1821 Maurice's mother finally left the Unitarian body, her son also having found its tenets and its narrowly sectarian outlook on life unappealing  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.175). No longer the dissenting ministry but the legal profession was his preferred option now. But in order to enhance his general education he judged a course at a university to be necessary, and chose Cambridge, where no religious test was imposed on entrance. Accordingly, in the October term of 1823, he took up residence at Trinity College, attending Julius Hare's lectures on the Greek drama and on Plato. Hare had little personal contact with Maurice, but sufficient to recognize in him an aptitude for philosophy. Maurice's official tutor was Frederick Field. He joined eagerly in university activities, spoke at the union, and was among the founders of the Apostles, another original member being Alfred Tennyson, whose lifelong friend he became. He also formed a close companionship with John Sterling (1806&#150;1844), a favourite pupil of Hare's and a great admirer of Coleridge, whose talk at Hampstead had fascinated him. With Sterling he transferred in October 1825 to Trinity Hall, where fellowships were tenable by barristers and awarded for a good degree in law. Here he read for the LLB course. He moved to London to study for the bar in the long vacation of 1826, returning to Cambridge the following term for his final examination, gaining a first class in civil law. On the strength of this he stood an excellent chance of a college fellowship, but felt himself unable to subscribe to the Church of England's <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, then still requisite for proceeding to a degree. He would not, he said, &#145;hang a bribe round his neck to lead his conscience&#146;, and removed his name from the college books.<br>
<br>While still at Cambridge, Maurice revealed a capacity for intellectual leadership, although by nature he was far from self-assertive. With the help of a friend he started the <span class="italic">Metropolitan Quarterly Magazine</span>, which ran for four issues, he himself contributing a fair proportion of the articles, including appreciative pieces on contemporary authors. Highly critical of Jeremy Bentham's views, his readiest praise was reserved for Coleridge, whose influence upon his thinking was already marked. In 1827 and 1828, and now living in London, he contributed to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> and made the acquaintance of J. S. Mill. With Sterling he also edited the lately founded <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, to which he gave a clearly reformist tone. Unfortunately it did not pay, and he was disturbed by troubles at home. His father had lost money through unsound investments and was no longer able to take in pupils. The family moved to Southampton and to a smaller house, where Frederick joined them. In the meantime his religious beliefs had undergone change; the Unitarianism of his upbringing was rejected and he resolved on ordination in the Church of England. Preparation for this meant a return to university life, and he now chose Oxford, entering Exeter College in 1830, where a friend of Sterling's, as college tutor, was able to arrange for his Cambridge terms to count as residence. But his funds were severely limited, and although he hoped to meet his expenses by means of a novel he was trying to get published, his position proved difficult. In the end he was saved by a small legacy that happened to come his way.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Maurice joined an essay society in which he came to know William Ewart Gladstone and James Bruce, afterwards eighth earl of Elgin. It was the latter who introduced him to the writings of the theologically minded Scottish laird Thomas Erskine (1788&#150;1870) of Linlathen, whose ideas, like those of Coleridge, were to prove a guiding influence on his thought, and who became a firm friend. He admitted that one of Erskine's books&#151;<span class="italic">The Brazen Serpent</span>&#151;was of &#145;unspeakable comfort&#146; to him  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.108, 121). Many years later he dedicated one of his own volumes, <span class="italic">The Prophets and Kings of the Old Testament</span> (1853), to Erskine. He was also interested, as Erskine was, in the activities of Edward Irving and his congregation at the Regent Square Chapel in London. On 29 March 1831 he was baptized, thus becoming formally a member of the Church of England. In November of the same year he graduated, with a second class. The death in July 1832 of his favourite sister, Emma, at whose bedside he had attended for months, caused him much sadness.<h2>
<a name="Ordinationandministry"></a>Ordination and ministry</h2>Maurice's ordination by the bishop of Lichfield took place on 26 January 1834, to an assistant curacy at Bubbenhall, near Leamington. Shortly afterwards his novel, <span class="italic">Eustace Conway, or, The Brother and Sister</span>, at last saw print, but although it won Coleridge's esteem it was not a commercial success. His first theological publication was his pamphlet <span class="italic">Subscription No Bondage</span> (1835), appearing under the pseudonym Rusticus, in which, somewhat paradoxically in view of his own experience, he undertook to defend the obligation of subscribing to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> on matriculating at the University of Oxford. His contention was that such subscription was no more than a declaration of the terms on which the institution professed to teach its students and they in turn agreed to learn. It was, he considered, fairer to state those terms openly than to conceal them. Later (1853) he changed his mind and advocated the abolition of tests. It was while a curate at Bubbenhall that he set to work on composing an article, &#145;Moral and metaphysical philosophy&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, a task which, with its successive revisions for later editions, was to occupy him on and off for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In January 1836 Maurice accepted the chaplaincy of Guy's Hospital in London, where in addition to his ordinary pastoral duties he lectured the students twice weekly on moral philosophy. His sister Priscilla kept house for him, and he also received a pupil, Edward Strachey (1812&#150;1901), whose friendship he retained over the years. He saw much of Sterling and came to know Thomas Carlyle, with whom, however, he found a good deal to disagree on, especially his alleged pantheism  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.276&#150;82). If the Scottish sage judged, even then, that Maurice's ideas were &#145;mainly moonshine and <i>Spitzfindigkeit</i>&#146;, Maurice could be equally caustic on Carlyle's own &#145;silly rant about the great bosom of nature&#146;  (ibid., 282). In 1836 the master of Downing College, Cambridge, offered him a lectureship there, but he declined the post. Soon afterwards he allowed himself to be named as a candidate for the chair of political economy at Oxford, a move supported by Newman and Pusey, who approved of his opinions on subscription. Maurice, on the other hand, was not drawn to the Tractarian theology&#151;at least as represented by Pusey's doctrine of baptism as an instantaneously transforming act, instead of, as he himself saw it, a witness to the truth of the continuing presence of Christ in the life of humanity. On perceiving how Maurice really stood on this matter the two decided to vote against him, and his name was withdrawn.<br>
<br>In June 1837, when staying with Julius Hare at his Herstmonceux rectory, Maurice met not only Sterling, who for a short time was Hare's curate, but Sterling's sister-in-law Anna Barton, whose acquaintance he had already made. He became engaged to her, and the couple were married at Clifton on 7 October 1837, Sterling himself officiating at the ceremony.<br>
<br>It was in this year that Maurice published certain letters addressed to his friend Samuel Clark, at that time a member of the Society of Friends but afterwards an Anglican clergyman. They subsequently appeared as <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</span> (1838), one of his most significant works. A second edition, considerably revised, with a dedication to the Revd Derwent Coleridge, was published in 1842. The subtitle of <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</span> was <i>Hints on the principles, ordinances, and constitution of the Catholic church</i>, and like the contemporary <span class="roman">Oxford Tracts</span> it expounds a firmly ecclesiastical theology grounded in scripture and tradition, while seeking to avoid what its author regarded as the dogmatic rigidity and party spirit of the Tractarians. It examines in turn the beliefs of a Quaker, an orthodox protestant, a Unitarian, and a rationalist philosopher, revealing notable insight and understanding in each case. Maurice's aim is to affirm the positive principle in the position criticized, but to show also how its overemphasis and systematic development generate error. He then looks for those signs of &#145;a spiritual and universal Kingdom&#146; by which one-sidedness could be transcended. Indeed Christ's kingdom, he claims, already exists, since it is constituted by the whole body of those who witness to Christ. The signs of this spiritual society are the sacraments of baptism and the eucharist, to which must be added the creeds, the liturgy, the episcopate, and the scriptures&#151;in fact, all the marks of catholicity as exemplified in the Church of England. However, the book was not well received by the religious press, and was to prove the ground of a sustained criticism that lasted throughout Maurice's career; to his great regret, he felt misunderstood and misrepresented, both personally and as a writer. Unfortunately his views were not easily grasped by the average reader, who was apt to find him obscure and confusing.<br>
<br>In September 1839 Maurice assumed part editorship of a new periodical, the <span class="italic">Educational Magazine</span>, his concern for national education having been heightened by the growing social unrest of the time, spearheaded, in the next decade, by Chartism. The following year he became sole editor, continuing to press the argument that the responsibility for schools should remain the church's, through agreement by the government with the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor. But the magazine was short-lived, ceasing publication in 1841. In June 1840 Maurice was elected to a professorship in English literature and history at King's College, London. The work appealed to him strongly, and his manner of lecturing was undoubtedly impressive from all accounts, but the effect of his discourses, it seems, was to elevate more than inform. Some of his students perhaps were able to understand him, though for the most part his lofty generalizations were inaccessible. That he was a man of distinction none would have questioned.<br>
<br>Maurice was fully alive to the ecclesiastical issues of the day. The joint Anglican&#150;Lutheran bishopric in Jerusalem, a proposal which greatly offended Newman and his associates, he found good reason to support, as he explained in his <span class="italic">Three Letters to the Rev. William Palmer</span> (1842). He saw it as a token of the true catholicity of the church, a wider conception than that of strict institutional unity. On the other hand, when E. B. Pusey was suspended by the vice-chancellor's court from preaching in Oxford because of his sermon at Christ Church extolling a high eucharistic doctrine, which his critics deemed heterodox, he protested vigorously in a letter to the evangelical leader Lord Ashley (afterwards earl of Shaftesbury), who had presided over a meeting to denounce the Tractarian teachings. And again, in 1844, after W. G. Ward's <span class="italic">Ideal of a Christian Church</span> had caused such a stir in Oxford, he likewise protested, in <span class="italic">Two Letters to a Non-Resident Member of Convocation</span>, against a statute which permitted the author to be deprived of his degree.<br>
<br>John Sterling's wife died on 18 April 1843, and Sterling himself, whose health had been failing, on 18 September 1844. Anna Maurice's own death was to follow on 25 March 1845, leaving two sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34949/', "John Frederick Maurice")</script>, was to compose, many years later, his father's biography. This succession of bereavements affected Maurice deeply. He also blamed himself for having been, as he thought, unsympathetic to Sterling in the loss of his religious faith.<br>
<br>At the end of 1843, when both the principalship of King's College, London, and the preachership of Lincoln's Inn were rendered vacant by the appointment of their existing holder, Dr John Lonsdale, to the see of Lichfield, Julius Hare was hopeful that Maurice would succeed him. Maurice himself was less sanguine. Ecclesiastically he was no party man, and he was regarded with suspicion by both evangelicals and Tractarians; he feared too that the other professors would by no means welcome him as their head and might even resign. He did not, in fact, desire any sort of prominence in the church, nor was he academically ambitious. The post therefore went to R. W. Jelf. In July 1845 he was nominated Boyle lecturer by the archbishop of York, and in August Warburton lecturer by the archbishop of Canterbury. The lectures he delivered at Lincoln's Inn on the latter foundation contained the substance of his book on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>; when this was published in 1846 it carried a preface in which Newman's theory of doctrinal development came under very critical review. The Boyle addresses appeared in 1847 as <span class="italic">The Religions of the World in their Relation to Christianity</span>, and in his lifetime were to be the most popular of his works. The choice of Maurice for these lectureships by the two archbishops seemed, in spite of what he himself might have apprehended, to indicate ecclesiastical favour, and when, in 1846, a theological department was established at King's, Jelf made him one of its professors.<br>
<br>In June of the same year Maurice was elected chaplain of Lincoln's Inn with a stipend of &pound;300 a year, thus affording him an opportunity to resign from his Guy's Hospital duties, which some felt to be putting a strain on his health  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.361). His new responsibilities comprised the reading of morning prayers at the Inn, with a full service on Sunday afternoons. His sermons at once proved a draw and were consistently well attended, especially by the younger barristers. Among his hearers were Thomas Hughes and J. M. Ludlow, soon to be associated with him in the Christian socialist movement. He had already in 1844 made Charles Kingsley's acquaintance, and the two men were by now on very friendly terms. In 1846 he and other members of the staff at King's founded Queen's College for the higher education of women, particularly of intending governesses, in whose needs his sister Mary, herself a teacher, was interested.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1844 Julius Hare had married Maurice's younger sister Esther. Some five years later, on 4 July 1849, Maurice himself remarried, taking as his wife Georgina Hare-Naylor, Julius Hare's half-sister.<h2>
<a name="Christiansocialism"></a>Christian socialism</h2>The year 1848 brought repeated news of revolutionary movements on the European continent and of Chartist agitation in England, the latter reaching its climax on 10 April with the much feared, but in the event abortive, march on parliament. Maurice's thoughts turned more and more to what he beheld as the &#145;spiritual destitution&#146; of the times, and to the need, as he perceived it, of moral and social regeneration. Indeed, until the twentieth-century revival of interest in Maurice as a theologian he was chiefly remembered as the protagonist of Christian socialism, supported by his friends Charles Kingsley, parson, novelist, and publicist, and John Malcolm Ludlow (1821&#150;1911), a barrister he had come to know at Lincoln's Inn and who, through his upbringing in France, had acquired first-hand knowledge of socialist and revolutionary groups in Paris. Moreover Ludlow possessed what Maurice lacked, an understanding of the requirements of effective political action. Others who joined them with a view to some kind of reformatory effort were Edward Vansittart Neale (1810&#150;1892), who devoted a considerable part of his personal fortune to the cause, and Thomas Hughes, the future author of <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span>. Maurice was from the first recognized as the spiritual leader of this group of Christian socialists, as they came to be called, and was looked to even for its necessary practical direction. With Ludlow, he edited a newspaper, <span class="italic">Politics for the People</span>, which managed to survive for some months despite financial loss. It began publication on 6 May 1848 and rose to a circulation of about 2000 copies. The contributors included Kingsley who, choosing the pen-name of Parson Lot, assumed the role of fire-eating journalist, happy to proclaim himself a Chartist too  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.101). But the articles were most effective when Ludlow, radical and clear-headed, was their author. He cared nothing for the susceptibilities of the established political parties, believed in a large extension of the franchise&#151;although he was opposed to universal suffrage&#151;and favoured big increases in direct taxation.<br>
<br>In 1850 Maurice publicly accepted the designation Christian socialist for his movement. It committed him, he declared, &#145;to the conflict we must engage in sooner or later with the unsocial Christians and the unchristian Socialists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.35). The same year (12 November) saw the publication of another periodical, carrying the name <span class="italic">Christian Socialist</span>, Ludlow being both founder and editor. Maurice was somewhat dubious about it, however, and left Ludlow with a free hand. Its aim was to present a view of society at once Christian and socialist, since Christianity, it was claimed, had by its very nature a social mission, and as things were, the alternative to a Christian socialism was a godless one. But whereas by socialism Ludlow meant socialism as he understood it&#151;collective control of the economy&#151;Maurice's ideal was vaguer and more utopian. He himself was no democrat in the populist sense, and certainly no egalitarian: hierarchy he thought essential to society&#151;a token, it could be said, of his instinctive Platonism. He disliked competition as fundamentally unchristian, and wished to see it, at the social level, replaced by co-operation, as expressive of Christian brotherhood. But politically he was a long way from radicalism, and his attitude more nearly approximated to a mild tory paternalism. He was, by disposition, impractical, and he disliked organizational activity. Basic principles were his terrain. As he once wrote to Ludlow: &#145;Let people call me merely a philosopher, or merely anything else &hellip; my business, because I am a theologian, and have no vocation except for theology, is not to build, but to dig, to show that economics and politics &hellip; must have a ground beneath themselves, and that society was not to be made by any arrangements of ours, but is to be regenerated by finding the law and ground of its order and harmony, the only secret of its existence, in God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.137). Ludlow shared Maurice's high moral aspirations, but doubted whether the existing churches were capable of promoting them.<br>
<br>Maurice held <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes and addressed meetings attended by working men who, although his words carried less of social and political guidance than moral edification, were invariably impressed by the speaker. But the actual means by which the competitiveness of the prevailing economic system was to be mitigated was judged to be the creation of co-operative societies, a conviction reinforced by what Ludlow had learned of French <i>associations ouvri&egrave;res</i> from a recent visit to Paris. Maurice saw in them a modern application of primitive Christian communism. Twelve workshops were to be set up in London for builders, tailors, shoemakers, and other artisan trades, liberally subsidized by Vansittart Neale and helped by the subscriptions of middle-class sympathizers. The workers' own efforts were also salted by teaching on the duties of citizenship and the responsibility of the franchise. For a time the societies thrived and gained the widespread approval of working-class sentiment. Regrettably, market profitability did not match social idealism, with the inevitable result, and personal friction brought discord to the fraternal harmony. In any case, Maurice's own interest really lay in education rather than economics. Kingsley's ebullient Chartist rhetoric, moreover, did not strengthen confidence in Christian socialist objectives among his fellow churchmen, as witness the public denunciation of his views on 22 June 1851 by the incumbent of St John's, Charlotte Street, G. S. Drew (1819&#150;1880), immediately following the sermon delivered there by Kingsley as guest preacher. This event caused a sensation and compromised Maurice's own reputation. The principal of King's College wrote to him hoping that he would disown Kingsley's utterances, which he deplored as &#145;reckless and dangerous&#146;. Indeed Maurice's leadership of the movement was no insignificant factor in his eventual dismissal from King's. But by then the movement itself was in decline, those who had created it feeling an increasing divergence in their personal concerns and goals. Maurice, for all his high-mindedness and attractiveness of character, was hardly fitted to head a venture dependent above all on practicability of aim. By 1854 its course was run.<h2>
<a name="Theologicalcontroversyeternalpunishment"></a>Theological controversy: eternal punishment</h2>Christian socialism did not, however, deflect Maurice from his vocation and tasks as a &#145;pure&#146; theologian. In 1853 he published his <span class="italic">Theological Essays</span>, a work which, it has to be said, even his admirers have found less than satisfactory. Not well written&#151;R. W. Church complained of its &#145;tormenting indistinctness&#146;&#151;it none the less is of first importance as a statement of Maurice's views, and in particular of his convictions on the doctrine of the eternal punishment of impenitent sinners, one which theological orthodoxy, protestant as well as Catholic, held to be indispensable for belief. Maurice denied it; at least he denied that &#145;eternal&#146; and &#145;everlasting&#146; are synonymous terms. His own conception, he explained, was founded on <span class="roman">John</span> 17: 3, &#145;This is life eternal, that they should know thee, the one true God, and him who thou hast sent, even Jesus Christ.&#146; Eternal life is therefore a quality of life attainable in this world. Not to know God is to forfeit that quality, to suffer the alienation from him which is spiritual death. The notion of duration in time is irrelevant. &#145;I cannot&#146;, he said, &#145;apply the idea of time to the word eternal. I must see eternity as something altogether out of time.&#146; Not that Maurice was a universalist, holding that in the end all would be saved: &#145;I dare not pronounce what are the possibilities of resistance in a human will to the loving will of God.&#146; &#145;But&#146;, he added, &#145;I know that there is something which must be infinite in the abyss of love beyond the abyss of death&#146;  (F. D. Maurice, <span class="italic">Theological Essays</span>, 1853, 406; cf. <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.15). He could not bring himself to believe that impenitence at death necessarily meant the soul's damnation and consignment to everlasting torments.<br>
<br>These scruples and hesitations failed to satisfy the many, especially among evangelicals, who, further offended by Maurice's ideas on the atonement, feared that tampering with the former doctrine would have grave practical implications in weakening the sanctions of personal morality. Jelf was perturbed. A lengthy correspondence ensued between himself and Maurice, from which he could only conclude that if his professor of theology did not believe in eternal punishment then it was unsuitable that the future training of clergymen should remain in his hands. He confronted him therefore with the choice of either resignation or dismissal. At a meeting of the college council on 27 October 1853 the bishop of London, C. J. Blomfield, had to consider a motion duly thanking Maurice for his past services but requiring his departure. Gladstone moved an amendment that &#145;competent theologians&#146; should be asked to examine the <span class="italic">Essays</span>, but he lost it, and on 11 November the council, poorly attended, declared Maurice's offices vacant. It grieved him that he was not even allowed to finish his lecture courses. But he received many and warm expressions of sympathy, and Alfred Tennyson marked the occasion with a poem addressed to him in January 1854. Even if to the majority of the public who had at all considered the matter his teachings remained unclear, it was widely felt that he had not been well used. The benchers of Lincoln's Inn declined to accept his offer to resign his chaplaincy, and although he did resign his chairmanship of the committee of Queen's College, he resumed it in 1856 at the unanimous request of its members.<br>
<br>Disappointed as he was at this abrupt termination of his own academic career, Maurice's concern for the education of the artisan class was nevertheless undiminished. In February 1854 he drew up a scheme for a working men's college, to some extent on the model of a &#145;people's college&#146; established in Sheffield back in 1842. It opened on 31 October 1854 in Red Lion Square, London, with some 120 students and with Maurice as its principal. Later it moved, first to Great Ormond Street and then to Crowndale Road. Besides Maurice's friends Vansittart Neale and Tom Hughes, the Tudor historian J. S. Brewer helped with the teaching, as too did John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It was a product of Christian socialism and an expression of its ideals.<h2>
<a name="Theologicalcontroversydivinerevelation"></a>Theological controversy: divine revelation</h2>Maurice himself deemed the most important controversy of his life to be his clash with Henry Longueville Mansel (1820&#150;1871), Waynflete professor of moral and metaphysical philosophy at Oxford and later dean of St Paul's. At issue was the fundamental theological question of the nature of man's knowledge of God. In 1858 Mansel delivered the Bampton lectures on &#145;The limits of religious thought examined&#146;, in which, with incisive clarity, he sought to defend the idea of divine revelation by means of a philosophical agnosticism. The finite mind, he contended, cannot comprehend the infinite. The revelation embodied in the dogmas of orthodox Christianity affords no knowledge of God as he is in himself, such being inaccessible to the speculative reason, but a knowledge which is &#145;regulative&#146; only, as adapted to the limitations and needs of the human condition. Revelation must therefore be accepted by believers simply as it is, on the substantiating evidence of miracle and prophecy, and attempts to rationalize its content on philosophical grounds are as vain as the claim to know God directly. To not a few of Mansel's hearers his arguments sounded like a final answer to all rationalist assaults on Christianity. But it stung Maurice into a quite violent rejoinder, published as <span class="italic">What is Revelation?</span> (1859). To him revelation was not oblique talk about God but a disclosure of God himself, in his love and mercy. He believed Mansel's procedure was a total misrepresentation of the real nature of both revelation and faith. To describe God's personal action merely as an imparting of propositions that can be used but never properly understood was, he objected, a travesty of the divine purpose. Unfortunately Maurice weakened his case by his blustering indignation. Even his friends were disconcerted. Mansel countered Maurice's strictures in a characteristically skilful <span class="italic">Examination</span> of them, which Maurice in turn answered with his <span class="italic">Sequel to the Inquiry, What is Revelation?</span> This restates his position in more moderate language but without showing any clear conception of what Mansel was about. The truth is that he failed to grasp the metaphysical problems inevitably raised by the claim to know God by immediate apprehension. Maurice may have had a deeper mystical sense, but Mansel was the better philosopher.<br>
<br>In July 1860 Maurice was presented to the living of St Peter's, Vere Street, which he was to occupy over the ensuing decade. But the appointment displeased the evangelical organ <span class="italic">The Record</span>, and an address signed by twenty-two clergymen was sent to the bishop of London, A. C. Tait, protesting against his institution. This move, however, was countered by another address, promoted by J. M. Ludlow, W. F. Hook, dean of Chichester, and others, bearing 332 clerical and 487 lay signatures, congratulating him on this &#145;tardy recognition&#146; of his services to the church. Among the signatories were Gladstone, Tennyson, and Connop Thirlwall, the learned and liberal-minded bishop of St David's.<br>
<br>Nevertheless a new difficulty soon beset Maurice. William Colenso, bishop of Natal, and a friend of Maurice's, consulted him when working on his book on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>. Maurice was much disturbed by the bishop's radical conclusions and suggested that people could even deem it right, in view of them, that he should resign his bishopric&#151;to which Colenso retorted that they might well think a like course to be appropriate for Maurice himself. The latter, alarmed by the outcome of the <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1860) furore, sensed that his own position could indeed become untenable, and judged that resignation, despite the protests of his sympathizers, would be preferable to deprivation. Although Tait would have been reluctant to accept the resignation, Maurice himself came to feel that his own insistence on it might be unfair to Colenso, whose personal confidence he had received. He therefore decided to hold on to his benefice, even though some members of his congregation were critical of what seemed to them a fussy scrupulosity  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.553) and took themselves elsewhere. In 1863 he replied to Colenso's newly published work, in which the bishop, in his own rather idiosyncratic way, not only denied the Mosaic authorship of the first five books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> but also their compositional unity and, in some respects, their historical authenticity in a series of open letters published as <span class="italic">The Claims of the Bible and of Science</span>, an act which led to some estrangement between the two men  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.485).<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>On 25 October 1866 Maurice was elected to the Knightbridge professorship of casuistry, moral theology, and moral philosophy at Cambridge, on the vacancy caused by the death of John Grote. The electors, who were all but unanimous in their decision, had evidently as much assurance of Maurice's theological orthodoxy as of his competence as a philosopher. He remained principal of the Working Men's College, though he attended there less often, as he likewise retained the Vere Street cure. But the journey to London each week for the conduct of the services proved too taxing and in October 1869 he resigned his charge on medical advice. All the same, he accepted the offer of St Edward's, Cambridge, in the gift of Trinity Hall. No stipend was attached to it and pastoral work was minimal, but it provided an opportunity for preaching to an intelligent audience. He was assiduous in his academic duties, and notwithstanding his natural shyness did his best to get to know the undergraduates personally. Besides completing his <span class="italic">Metaphysical and Moral Philosophy</span> (2 vols., 1871&#150;2), he published his university lectures as <span class="italic">The Conscience: Lectures on Casuistry</span> (1868) and <span class="italic">Social Morality</span> (1869). His health, however, was visibly declining. Even so, he did not refuse the bishop of London's offer of the Cambridge preachership at Whitehall, delivering sermons there in the winter months of 1871&#150;2, as well as two university sermons in Cambridge. On 30 March he resigned from St Edward's, being very weak and mentally depressed. Two days later he lost consciousness, regaining it sufficiently to murmur a blessing before he died, on 1 April 1872 at 6 Bolton Row, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>A proposal was made that Maurice should be buried in Westminster Abbey, but it was the unanimous view of his family that he would not have wished it. He was, accordingly, interred at Highgate cemetery, in the vault where the remains of his parents and sisters lay.<h2>
<a name="Mauriceandhisintellectuallegacy"></a>Maurice and his intellectual legacy</h2>Maurice was a man whose presence impressed all who met him. Of slightly less than medium height and somewhat reserved in manner&#151;if always markedly courteous&#151;his bearing was not only dignified but, by all accounts, expressive of the spiritual and moral integrity which was felt by his friends and acquaintances to be the defining quality of his character. Kingsley thought him &#145;the most beautiful human soul&#146; he had known. Others did not hesitate to describe him as &#145;saintlike&#146;. Yet he was certainly a controversial figure. He would not retreat before an issue that stirred his convictions, as in his famous but mainly unfortunate dispute with Mansel. In the last decade of his life, however, his public esteem was high, especially among laymen. Thus Sir Thomas Acland wrote to him: &#145;For more than a quarter of a century you have been helping Englishmen to see through the theories and systems which have been invented to prop up, restore, develop or narrow the ancient edifice of their national Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.541). He was also prescient, with little of the complacent Victorian optimist about him: &#145;Are we to live&#146;, he asked, &#145;in an age in which every mechanical facility for communication between man and man is multiplied ten-thousandfold, only that the inward isolation, the separation of those who meet continually, may be increased in a far greater measure?&#146;  (F. D. Maurice, <span class="italic">The Lord's Prayer: Nine Sermons</span>, 5.24).<br>
<br>As a theological thinker Maurice had depth and unquestionable originality. By his own admission his aim was &#145;to dig&#146;, to penetrate to the spiritual roots of human life. He had no time for mere eclecticism, but he distrusted and disliked system building. As he described it, &#145;dexterity is shown, not in detecting facts, but in cutting them square&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lectures on the Ecclesiastical History of the First and Second Centuries</span>, 1854, 222). His cast of mind was naturally Platonist. In addition to the influence of Plato's dialogues, that of the seventeenth-century Cambridge Platonists, and of Coleridge, is obvious. His Platonizing view that &#145;Christ is in every man&#146; as the head of redeemed humanity, and that salvation is essentially the recognition of this, together with its corollary that a theology whose starting point is the fall and sin, rather than grace and redemption, is misdirected, offended evangelical belief&#151;one of his sharpest critics was the Wesleyan Methodist divine Dr J. H. Rigg&#151;just as it distanced him also from the Tractarians, whose exclusivist doctrine of episcopacy likewise he would have wished to qualify. Yet he firmly declined to regard himself as broad church, a position which, in its attempt to commend religious faith to contemporary thought, he considered to involve a dilution of the church's formularies, on adherence to which he, as a committed Anglican, would not compromise. He believed firmly in the role of the Church of England as a national church, at once Catholic and protestant, which he did not see as incompatible principles but as complementary aspects of the faith, with their respective truths as constitutive elements in a vital unity. What he might have learned from the broad-churchmen was a keener appreciation of the significance of historical criticism for biblical exegesis, while the possible implications of Darwinism for religious belief, which much concerned them, seemed scarcely to interest him.<br>
<br>Although the eminent Unitarian thinker James Martineau held that Maurice had no superior among contemporary theologians in consistency of thought and precision of language, many of his readers found his ideas somewhat mystifying, with distinctions urged where they themselves could discern no differences, or unity &#145;revealed&#146; where they saw only contrariety. Lucidity, it has to be conceded, was not the prime virtue of his literary style. It may well be judged that he published too much, and with insufficient discrimination. Again, despite the fact that he was the author of a copious work entitled <span class="italic">Metaphysical and Moral Philosophy</span> (1871&#150;2), he was not a philosopher in the sense that connotes rigorous intellectual analysis. Even as a theological thinker it was less the elucidation of principles that interested him than their application to the needs and opportunities of life. Yet his influence on later nineteenth-century Anglican thought, as the instances of F. J. A. Hort and his Cambridge associates testify, was pervasive. Even the post-Tractarians did not escape it, as the publication in 1889 of <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span>, or the foundation in the same year of the Christian Social Union, also demonstrate. He was indeed a seminal figure in this respect. After some decline in his reputation in the first half of the twentieth century, revival of interest accelerated, thanks to the studies of A. R. Vidler, Bishop Michael Ramsey, and others, as the centenary of his death approached. He is now recalled as one of the outstanding contributors to the English, and especially the Anglican, theological tradition.<br>
