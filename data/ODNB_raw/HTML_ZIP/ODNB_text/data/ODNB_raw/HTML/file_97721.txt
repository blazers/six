<span class="headword">Cadbury,  Peter Egbert</span>  (1918&#150;2006), <span class="occ">aviator and businessman</span>, was born on 6 February 1918 at 6 Kimberley Terrace, Great Yarmouth, the elder son of Sir Egbert Cadbury (1893&#150;1967), then a flight commander in the Royal Naval Air Service, and his wife, Mary Forbes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips. He attended Leighton Park School, the Quaker establishment founded by his grandfather George Cadbury, a member of the Cadbury chocolate family, and then went to Trinity College, Cambridge. But his interests were fired more by the exploits of his father, a First World War air ace who shot down two zeppelins and was promoted air commodore before becoming managing director of the chocolate business (and being knighted in 1957).<br>
<br>Cadbury was taught to fly by his father at the age of seventeen and in 1940 he joined the Fleet Air Arm. He was seconded to the Ministry of Aircraft Production, where he became one of the test pilots assigned to test the new Meteor jet aircraft. It was a high-risk profession and many of his colleagues died. But Cadbury survived to become a caricature of the dashing pilot, rarely without a fast car, a pretty girl, and a gung-ho quip, and always looking for an argument. He rejoiced in his nickname, the Cad. When he married Eug&eacute;nie Benedicta Down-Byrne at Westminster register office on 13 December 1947 the legendary fighter pilot Douglas Bader was best man. Cadbury's first wife was three years younger than him, daughter of Major Ewen Cameron Bruce, army officer, and the former wife of St John Down-Byrne. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1945 Cadbury had accepted an invitation from the Liberals to contest Stroud in the election of that year, because of his family's traditional links with the party. He reputedly told the electors, &#145;If you don't like any of [my views], I can change them because I only learned them yesterday&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 April 2006). Nevertheless he still managed to win 30 per cent of the vote. Soon afterwards he joined his natural home, the Conservative Party, and spent eight years at the bar (1946&#150;54). This included a spell as an assistant prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, where he accompanied his godfather, the formidable Norman Birkett. He showed no interest in working for the family business and his own high-profile commercial exploits were later a contrast, and often an embarrassment, to the rigorous standards of corporate governance associated with his more strait-laced Cadbury cousins.<br>
<br>Cadbury's business career began in 1954 when he borrowed &pound;75,000 from his father to buy the Keith Prowse ticket agency. Block bookings by Prowse could determine success or failure in the West End theatre and when Cadbury, who backed his own middlebrow tastes, declared that he only supported shows that his mother would like, John Osborne bemoaned the fact that plays should depend on &#145;catching the fancy of a tasteless man's tasteless mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 April 2006). He floated the business in 1960 for &pound;1.5 million, a rapid profit. He remained chairman until 1971, in spite of a rebellion by his fellow directors about his autocratic style in 1964.<br>
<br>Cadbury was attracted by the profits in commercial television, launched in 1955 and memorably described by Lord Thomson as &#145;a licence to print money&#146;. He became a director of Tyne Tees in 1957. Then he sought what the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> called &#145;the last big plum&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, 17 Dec 1959), the west country franchise. He had few local connections and later described himself as driving down with only a copy of <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. He still assembled a formidable consortium including the TUC, lord lieutenants, and Daphne du Maurier. It beat eleven other bids. Westward Television was launched on 29 April 1961. But extravagant spending on local promotion and an overrun on purpose-built studios combined with a new government-imposed advertising duty to bring an early crisis and lay-offs. Cadbury fulminated publicly against the duty and the encroachment of neighbouring franchises, and demanded the expansion of the region to take in Bristol. In 1970 the board voted him out; one member said he was &#145;sick and tired of his wild statements&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 April 2006). However, he was back eight days later thanks to his control of the majority of voting shares.<br>
<br>Cadbury's control of Westward brought him to public notice. The station made a genuine connection with its region and was consistently regarded as the friendliest, if sometimes the most amateur, of the ITV stations. He ran it mainly from London. When he drove down to Plymouth in one of his fast cars&#151;a Ferrari or a Bentley&#151;he would head for the bar, the pretty girls, and the fruit machine. Many of the staff idolized him and he treated them with a mixture of challenging demand &#145;if at first you don't succeed, you are fired&#146;  (private information)&#151;and encouraging delegation. As one producer put it, &#145;he was good to work for particularly when he wasn't there&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>As television became more regulated, however, Cadbury's autocratic style and choleric behaviour, usually in full public view and often in the newspaper letter columns, led to problems. Speeding led to confrontations with the police, and he began a vendetta against the local chief constable, attempting to keep him off Westward transmissions. He was charged with wasting police time over an anonymous letter alleging local authority corruption and also for shooting protected geese. It didn't help that his letters were routinely written on Westward notepaper. When, in frustration with local airline services, Cadbury founded his own airline on the Westward budget, the licence renewal due in 1980 looked increasingly unlikely. His solution was to bring in Lord Harris of Greenwich, a former minister in the Home Office (which allocated the licences). The tactic backfired as Harris sniffed the political wind and told Cadbury that with his behaviour, they did not stand &#145;a snowball's chance in hell&#146; of renewal. Harris persuaded the board to vote him out but the staff petitioned for reinstatement. Cadbury reluctantly decided not to force the issue and left the company in early 1980. When the franchise was refused, he sent Harris a telegram asking what it was like &#145;to be a snowball in hell&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 April 2006). Later he attempted and failed to buy MG and the Playboy Club but bizarrely acquired a loss-making magazine, <span class="italic">Working Woman</span>, where he sacked the feminist editor and soon closed it.<br>
<br>Cadbury's first marriage was dissolved in 1968 and on 15 April 1970, at Kensington register office, he married Jennifer Mary Victoria Morgan-Jones (later well known as the businesswoman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/89968/', "Jennifer D'Abo (1945&#150;2003)")</script>), whom he had employed at Keith Prowse. The daughter of Michael William Vernon Hammond-Maude, land agent, she had already supported him through Westward crises and he later explained their divorce in 1976 by saying that &#145;she was a better entrepreneur than I am&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 April 2006). On 29 July 1976 he married, as his third wife, at Chelsea register office, (Angela) Jane Mead, a 36-year-old divorcee, and daughter of Harry St George, army officer. They had two sons. Cadbury meanwhile ran through a succession of grand country houses, where he regularly quarrelled with neighbours, at Preston Candover, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, where he had his own airstrip, at Lyneham House in Devon, where he complained of &#145;police harassment&#146;, and finally at Upton Grey Lodge, Upton Grey, also near Basingstoke. When it was burgled in 1994, he resigned from the Conservative Party criticizing its failure on law and order, and announced that he slept with a shotgun under his pillow. In 1999 thieves broke in again and their haul included his shotgun. He replaced it with a crossbow. Over 400 of his former staff turned out at a dinner in his honour in 2001, and others regularly visited after he suffered a major stroke in 2004. He died of a further stroke at Upton Grey Lodge on 17 April 2006, and was survived by his third wife, Jane, and five children.<br>
