<span class="headword">Hill,  Adam</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1595), <span class="occ">religious writer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was a native of Salisbury, where he was one of the clever youths trained by Bishop John Jewel. He continued his education at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated on 5 April 1568 and was elected a fellow in the same year. He proceeded MA in 1572 but resigned his fellowship on 12 January 1573. He appears to have earned his living for some time as a schoolmaster, but also sought preferment in the church. In 1577 he became vicar of Westbury, and on 8 March 1578, aged about thirty, he was ordained priest by John Aylmer, bishop of London. In 1579 he was presented to the Wiltshire vicarage of Bishop's Lavington. The patron for this turn was Lord Burghley, which suggests that Hill was now regarded by the authorities as a man with a future. He resigned this second living in 1580 but in 1579 or 1580 obtained two further preferments in Dorset and Wiltshire. On 4 April 1582 he was instituted to the prebend of Gillingham Minor in Salisbury Cathedral, where on 16 January 1584 he became succentor. In the meantime he continued his studies, proceeding both BTh and DTh at Oxford on 2 July 1591.<br>
<br>The fruits of his learning are apparent in Hill's published writings. <span class="italic">The Crie of England</span>, a sermon denouncing the vices of the age, delivered at Paul's Cross in September 1593 and printed in 1595 at the request of the lord mayor and aldermen of London, to whom it is dedicated, is lavishly illustrated with citations from sacred and secular sources. And his learning is still more apparent in <span class="italic">The Defence of the Article</span> (1592), the article in question being the dogma of Christ's descent into hell, which Hill defended against Alexander Hume, an exiled Scottish presbyterian then employed as a schoolmaster at Bath. Here he deploys a massive array of authorities, classical, biblical, patristic, and contemporary, in a controversy which became increasingly acrimonious. When Hill complained of being traduced as &#145;a Bishopling and a time-server&#146;, Hume responded acidly &#145;Is truth a reveiling?&#146;  (Hume, 148).<br>
<br>The charge was an easy one for Hume to make. The <span class="italic">Defence</span> is dedicated to Archbishop Whitgift, and in it Hill stands forth as a defender of both religious orthodoxy and ecclesiastical authority. He attacks the attempt to allegorize the disputed article both because it undermines &#145;a most comfortable doctrine that Christ doth deliver us from hell&#146;  (Hill, <span class="italic">Defence</span>, 68<i>v</i>), and also because it leaves the way open to the free interpretation of all the fundamental doctrines of the church, creating a situation in which &#145;every man will be a head, no man a foote, every man a tung, no man a eare&#146;  (ibid., 30). Hume came back strongly, with a rejoinder (dedicated to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex) whose title-page accuses his opponent of at least 600 &#145;fallacies and deceits in reason&#146;, but Hill had no chance to retaliate in kind, for he died about 16 February 1595 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 19 February. His exchanges with Hume reveal in passing that Hill had been an active preacher in Wiltshire, at various times taking the pulpit in Laycock, Trowbridge, and Chippenham, and engaging in a lively dispute in Salisbury with a fellow prebendary, Abraham Conham, that had to be settled by the bishop. Such activities, combined with his evident learning and his readiness to defend the church establishment, give some support to Wood's belief that had Hill &#145;not been untimely snatched away by death, he would have been advanced to an high degree in the church&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.623).<br>
