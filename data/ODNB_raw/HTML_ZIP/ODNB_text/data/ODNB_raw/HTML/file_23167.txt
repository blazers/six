<span class="headword">Rauzzini,  Venanzio</span>  (1746&#150;1810), <span class="occ">singer and music teacher</span>, was born in Camerino in the Roman Apennines on 18 December 1746 and studied singing and composition at Rome. During the carnival seasons in 1764&#150;6 the handsome young castrato sang in intermezzos at the Teatro della Valle, taking female roles, for in Rome women were not allowed to appear on the public stage. He sang the title role in Pietro Guglielmi's opera <span class="italic">Sesostri</span> in the Ascension festival at Venice in 1766 and entered the service of the elector of Bavaria, who spent lavishly on opera at Munich. Rauzzini was permitted to sing in opera at Vienna and Venice in 1767 but otherwise remained in Munich, where Charles Burney found him &#145;a charming singer, a pleasing figure, and a good actor&#146; as well as an excellent performer on the harpsichord and a skilful composer of comic operas and <i>opera seria</i> arias  (Burney, <span class="italic">Present State</span>, 1.128). Rauzzini's brother <a name="cosubject_23167"></a><span class="headword">Matteo Rauzzini</span>  (1754&#150;1791), <span class="occ">composer and singing teacher</span>, was also in Munich; Matteo later worked in Venice and in Dublin, where he died. According to Michael Kelly, Venanzio Rauzzini was advised to leave Munich in 1772 after &#145;an exalted personage became deeply and hopelessly enamoured of him&#146;  (Kelly, 1.10) and he appeared in operas at Milan, Venice, Padua, and Turin. In Milan he created the role of Cecilio in Mozart's <span class="italic">Lucio Silla</span>, first performed in December 1772, and Mozart then composed the virtuoso solo motet <span class="italic">Exsultate, Jubilate</span> for him.<br>
<br>Rauzzini made his London d&eacute;but at the King's Theatre in November 1774 as Rinaldo in the pasticcio <span class="italic">Armida</span>, singing arias which he himself had composed. He sang with &#145;the disadvantage of a terrible cold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney</span>, 2.187), but &#145;his taste, fancy, and delicacy, together with his beautiful person and spirited and intelligent manner of acting, before the season was over, gained him general approbation&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 4.501). David Garrick, impressed by Rauzzini's acting in the title role of Antonio Sacchini's <span class="italic">Montezuma</span>, is said to have rushed backstage to embrace him. Rauzzini remained as primo uomo at the King's Theatre for three seasons and also composed for the company. His most successful opera, the two-act tragedy <span class="italic">Piramo e Tisbe</span>, had its premi&egrave;re on 16 March 1775, with Rauzzini as Piramo, and was revived in three later seasons. His pastoral <span class="italic">L'ali d'amore</span> was produced in 1776 and 1777, with his pupil Nancy Storace as Cupido. Rauzzini also sang at concerts in aid of the Fund for the Support of Decayed Musicians and the Lock Hospital, at the Three Choirs meetings in 1775&#150;7, and festivals at Oxford, Winchester, and Salisbury.<br>
<br>In autumn 1777 Rauzzini was replaced by Francesco Roncaglia as principal man at the opera, but he was in demand as a performer in private concerts and as a teacher of gifted amateur and professional singers. From autumn 1777 he worked with the violinist Franz Lamotte in three winter subscription series in Bath, at the Rotunda in Dublin (summer 1778), and in two spring subscription series in London. Lamotte, in debt, fled to the continent in summer 1780 leaving Rauzzini in financial difficulties for the next few years. In London in 1781&#150;2 he sang at benefits for his pupil, the composer and pianist Jane Guest, and had his own concert series in spring 1781. That September and Christmas he took part as composer and singer in lavish entertainments given by the young William Beckford at Fonthill, Wiltshire. During the next few years he composed four operas, an act of a pasticcio, and ballet music for the King's Theatre. The 1781&#150;2 season was marred by a dispute with his colleague Sacchini over the authorship of some opera arias. The company was in artistic and financial disarray and Rauzzini's last opera, <span class="italic">La vestale</span> (1 May 1787), had only two performances. After this he lived permanently in Bath, having been in sole charge of the concerts there since at least January 1781.<br>
<br>Rauzzini lived in a town house in Bath and in the summer at Perrymead Villa, Widcombe, overlooking the city. Haydn visited him there in August 1794 and composed the canon &#145;Turk was a Faithful Dog&#146; as a gift for his host, taking the words from the garden memorial to Rauzzini's favourite dog. Rauzzini was acknowledged as &#145;the father of a new style in English singing, and a new race of singers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, 1807, 232), teaching Elizabeth Billington, John Braham, Elizabeth Clendining, Charles Incledon, Rosemond Mountain, and Nancy Storace. In Dublin in 1778 he had given lessons to the tenor Michael Kelly and advised him to study in Italy; Kelly writes glowingly of Rauzzini's hospitality and the devotion of his pupils, telling of how Mrs Billington renounced profitable engagements to perform gratis at Bath. Rauzzini remained a prolific composer of instrumental pieces and vocal music in English and Italian. In 1808 he published <span class="italic">Twelve Solfeggi</span>, with an introduction &#145;To my Scholars&#146; which is full of sound advice. He died at his home, 13 Gay Street, on 8 April 1810, while preparing for the Bath June music festival. Four days later the <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span> wrote:<blockquote>In private life few men were more esteemed; none more generally beloved. A polished suavity of manners, a mild and cheerful disposition, and a copious fund of general and polite information, rendered him an attractive and agreeable companion. &hellip; In Mr. Rauzzini, this city has sustained a public loss.</blockquote>He was buried in Bath Abbey, where there is a memorial to him erected by &#145;his affectionate Pupils Anna Selina Storace and John Braham&#146;.<br>
