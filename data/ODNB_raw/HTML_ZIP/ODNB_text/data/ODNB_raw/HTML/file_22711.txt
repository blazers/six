<span class="headword">Pratt, Sir  Thomas Simson</span>  (1797&#150;1879), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Captain James Pratt and Anne, daughter of William Simson, and was educated at the University of St Andrews. He was gazetted an ensign in the 26th regiment on 2 February 1814, and served in the Southern Netherlands in the same year as a volunteer with the 56th regiment. He was present at the attack on Merxem on 2 February and the subsequent bombardment of Antwerp. He purchased his captaincy on 17 September 1825. Pratt married, in 1827, Frances Agnes, second daughter of John S. Cooper; they had two sons and one daughter. He was with the 26th regiment in the China expedition, and as brevet major commanded the land forces at the assault and capture of the forts of Chuenpe (Chuanbi) on 7 January 1841, and again at the capture of the Bogue (Humen) forts on 26 February. In the attacks on Canton (Guangzhou), from 24 May to 1 June, he was in command of his regiment, and was present also at the demonstration before Nanking (Nanjing), and at the signing of the treaty of peace on board HMS <i>Cornwallis</i>. On 28 August 1841 he was gazetted lieutenant-colonel, and on 14 October 1841 was made a CB. From 5 September 1843 to 23 October 1855 he was deputy adjutant-general at Madras.<br>
<br>In October 1858 Pratt was promoted major-general, and in 1859 appointed to command the troops in Australia and New Zealand. He reached Melbourne in January 1860. When, in early July, he learned of the serious reverses suffered by British troops in the Waitara district of Taranaki, New Zealand, he himself went, with reinforcements, to direct operations. His operations were cautious. Avoiding his predecessor's mistake of fighting in the open, he reduced the Maori <i>pa</i> with minimum casualties by using earthworks to provide cover. This was slow, unspectacular, and successful. The New Zealand command was separated from that of Australia, and a new commander arrived early in 1861; by then the Taranaki revolt had been suppressed. Pratt returned to Australia in April, and continued to command there until 1863, when he returned to England and was appointed to the colonelcy of the 37th regiment. For services in New Zealand, he was made KCB on 16 July 1861. In the first ceremony of its kind in Australia, he was publicly invested on 15 April 1862 by Sir Henry Barkly, governor of Victoria, who in 1860 had married Pratt's daughter, Anne Maria. He was promoted general on 26 May 1873, and in October 1877 retired from active service. Pratt died at his residence, 13 Cavendish Place, Bath, on 2 February 1879.<br>
