<span class="headword">Adams,  Henry Cadwallader</span>  (1817&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 4 November 1817 at 6 Great James Street, Holborn, London, the third son of John Adams, of St Pancras, an assistant judge, and his second wife, Jane, daughter of Thomas Martin of Nottingham. He was educated at Westminster School and Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford, and then at Magdalen College, where he graduated BA in 1840 (second class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>) and proceeded MA in 1842. In June 1843 he was appointed an examiner in the responsive schools and then in July he was elected a probationer-fellow of Magdalen. He was appointed master of Magdalen College School on 22 March 1844 but resigned a month later to take up an appointment as master at Winchester College, a post he retained until 1851. He was ordained a deacon on 20 December 1846 and a priest in 1852 by the bishop of Oxford. He was appointed curate of Greinton, Somerset, in 1852. Upon his marriage to Esther Pell Edmonds, the second daughter of Richard Edmonds, rector of Woodleigh, Devon, on 6 July 1852, Adams resigned his Magdalen fellowship. He became chaplain to Bromley College, Kent, in 1855, a post he held until 1867 when he resigned to become vicar of Dry Sandford with Cothill, Berkshire, where he remained until 1878. On 15 July of that year he was installed by the bishop of Chichester as vicar of Old Shoreham, Sussex, where he stayed until 1896.<br>
<br>Adams was a prolific writer (in Allibone's supplement forty-seven works are listed), his works dividing into four principal categories: religious commentaries, Greek and Latin grammars, school stories, and historical tales such as <span class="italic">The Boy Cavaliers, or, The Siege of Clidesford</span> (1868), <span class="italic">Friend or Foe: a Tale of Sedgemoor</span> (1870), or <span class="italic">Tales of the Prophets</span> and <span class="italic">Tales of the Kings</span> (both 1872). Adams's forte, however, was as a writer of boys' school stories. He extolled the monitorial system, and he was one of the first of the Victorians to treat this subject seriously with such stories as <span class="italic">Tales of Charlton School</span> (1851) or <span class="italic">Schoolboy Honour</span> (1861). In the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> his history of Winchester College, <span class="italic">Wykehamica</span> (1878), is praised partly as a collection of school stories that will be popular among boys but &#145;its higher value, as the author perceives, lies in its record of the birth and development of the English system of public schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 47/1214, 1 Feb 1879, 148). Adams was also a passable poet. He died at his home, West Uplands, Portsmouth Road, Guildford, Surrey, on 17 October 1899.<br>
