<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kilham,  Alexander</span>  (1762&#150;1798), <span class="occ">a founder of the Methodist New Connexion</span>, was born at Epworth, Lincolnshire, on 10 July 1762, the third son of Simon Kilham (<i>d</i>. 1801/2) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1785). His father was a linen weaver who later extended his business to include the making of sacking. His parents were zealous Methodists, but the young Alexander left his parents' faith and was careless for a time until, at the age of eighteen, when working at Owston Ferry, not far from his home, he was converted during a revival at Epworth and joined the local Methodist society, where he helped in prayer meetings and other work, until he became a local preacher in 1782, preaching his first sermon at Luddington, Lincolnshire. He came to the notice of the squire of Raithby, Robert Carr Brackenbury, who had just been accepted by Wesley as one of his travelling preachers. After travelling for a short time in Lincolnshire, he accompanied Brackenbury to Jersey, where they were successful in establishing the first Methodist society in spite of much local opposition. They returned to the mainland in the summer of 1784.<br>
<br>In spite of a natural reluctance to lose his son from the family business, Alexander's father raised no objections to his offering his services to Wesley, whom Alexander had met at Nottingham in 1783. Two years later he was received into full connection and was appointed to Horncastle (1785) and Gainsborough (1786) in Lincolnshire. Then followed some years in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and periods in Scarborough (1787&#150;8), Pocklington (1789), and Whitby (1790). He married Sarah Grey (<i>d</i>. 1797) of Pickering at Easter 1788; they had one daughter, Sarah, who survived to adulthood, and two sons who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Kilham had early shown his independent mind when in Grimsby he had registered as a dissenter under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> in order to obtain a preaching licence to protect himself against the opposition of the vicar of Skendleby, Edward Brackenbury, his patron's brother. With the death of Wesley his mind found further scope for expression.<br>
<br>Stationed at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1791, Kilham's superintendent was Joseph Cownley, a supporter of greater freedom for Methodist preachers, who had administered the sacrament of the Lord's supper to his congregation. This had hitherto been forbidden to travelling preachers who had not been ordained, in the interest of the established church. Other calls for greater freedom were made after Wesley's death. In May 1791 the Hull circuit published a circular advising Methodists not to rank themselves as dissenters, to meet only out of church hours, and to receive the sacrament only in the parish church. Cownley had opposed this plea, for which he was strongly criticized. Kilham rushed to his defence in a pamphlet published under the pseudonym Truman and Freeman, which drew on him the censure of the conference in 1792. He was appointed to the Aberdeen circuit, presumably to remove him from the mainstream of Methodist life, but it only served to strengthen his convictions, for the life of the surrounding presbyterian churches was strongly anti-episcopal and anti-Church of England. From the conference point of view, it could hardly have been a more unfortunate appointment. Henceforth a steady stream of &#145;reform&#146; pamphlets issued from his pen under pseudonyms such as Aquila and Priscilla and Martin Luther.<br>
<br>Kilham remained in Aberdeen for three years, during which time he clarified his dissenting principles and called for complete separation from the Church of England if Methodists were to gain their &#145;Gospel privileges&#146;. In his pamphlets he argued not only for the right of Methodists to receive the sacrament at the hands of their own preachers, in their own chapels, but for the right of lay members to have a share in the running of the circuits, and that lay delegates should represent their circuits in conference. Furthermore, he utterly rejected the idea of making some preachers into Methodist bishops.<br>
<br>The turmoil throughout the connexion was such that in 1795 conference agreed to the &#145;plan of pacification&#146;, which granted some of Kilham's requests, though not those relating to the place of laymen in the life of the church. The plan was accepted by all preachers present except Kilham and four or five others, who saw it as only a temporary remedy, arguing for further reforms. At the end of the year Kilham issued another pamphlet, this time under his own name, <span class="italic">The Progress of Liberty amongst the People called Methodists</span>. In this he elaborated his proposals for the participation of laymen in the governing of the church, especially in the appointment of preachers, both local and travelling. This gave rise to such hostility that Kilham, now stationed at Alnwick, was arraigned first before the district meeting and then before the conference, which dismissed him as a preacher on 28 July 1796.<br>
<br>Kilham now felt free to act. In that year he started the issue of a magazine, the <span class="italic">Methodist Monitor</span>, in which he set forth the need for a root and branch reform of Methodism. At the following conference of 1797 at Leeds a &#145;people's delegation&#146; met, asking for the reforms Kilham had proposed; conference made some minor concessions, but would not move on the subject of nominations of membership or the possibility of meetings taking place without a travelling preacher. The reformers could not accept this, and at that conference three other preachers seceded or were expelled, and these with others met in the Baptist Ebenezer Chapel, Leeds, which they bought as the first chapel of the &#145;new itinerancy&#146;, or the Methodist New Connexion, as it was soon called. William Thom became its first president and the ever indefatigable Kilham its secretary, this of course in addition to circuit duties in Sheffield, to which circuit he had been appointed by the first Methodist New Connexion conference in that year. The organization of the new connexion, which gained 5000 members in the first year, was completed at the conference of 1798. Kilham was sent to the Nottingham circuit, the connexion's largest.<br>
<br>Immediately Kilham set about seeking to extend and build up the new church, which was particularly strong in south and west Yorkshire, north-east Cheshire, and Tyneside. On 12 April 1798 he married his second wife, Hannah Spurr (1774&#150;1832) of Sheffield, who as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15526/', "Mrs Hannah Kilham")</script> worked as a missionary and scholar of unwritten African languages; they had one daughter, Mary, who died in 1802. Travelling both as reformer and evangelist clearly took up much of Kilham's time, and contributed to his ill health. In the autumn of 1798 he set out, in spite of sickness, on a visit to Wales, but caught a severe chill and returned home to Nottingham. He tried to struggle on with his circuit and other engagements, but his heavy work load had completely exhausted him. He died in Nottingham on 20 December 1798, after expressing his zeal for evangelism in his deathbed plea, &#145;Tell all the world that Jesus is precious.&#146; He was buried in Hockley chapel, Nottingham.<br>
