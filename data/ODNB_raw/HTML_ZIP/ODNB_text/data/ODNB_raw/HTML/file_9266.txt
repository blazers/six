<span class="headword">Fellowes,  Robert</span>  (1770&#150;1847), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, born on 15 May 1770 at Gay Bowers, Danbury, Essex, was the son of William Fellowes (1740&#150;1778) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1772), the daughter of Samuel Harris of London, and the grandson of William Fellowes of Shottesham Hall, Norfolk. Educated for the church at St Mary Hall, Oxford (BA 1796, MA 1801), he took orders, but seems to have held no preferment. For more than six years (1804&#150;11) he edited the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>. He was the intimate friend of Samuel Parr (1747&#150;1825), who introduced him to Queen Caroline, whose cause he embraced. He is said to have written all her replies to the numerous addresses presented to her in 1820.<br>
<br>At his death in 1824, Francis Maseres, cursitor-baron of the exchequer, left Fellowes nearly &pound;200,000. Fellowes erected to the memory of Maseres a monument in Reigate churchyard, with a eulogistic inscription in Latin, and used his fortune with great generosity, both in helping private individuals and in forwarding benevolent schemes. In 1826 he gave benefactions to encourage the study of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University, and he was one of the promoters of the London University. Out of gratitude for the professional services of Dr John Elliotson, who held a chair of medicine in University College, he provided there two annual gold medals, the Fellowes medals, for proficiency in clinical medicine. Fellowes also interested himself in the opening of Regent's Park to the public, and in the emancipation of the Jews. In politics, he was an advanced liberal, although he opposed universal suffrage. In 1828 he purchased <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, an important organ of intellectual radicalism, and made Albany Fonblanque editor.<br>
<br>Fellowes published many religious and theological works of his own, including <span class="italic">A Picture of Christian Philosophy</span> (1799) and <span class="italic">Religion without Cant</span> (1801); in these volumes he always advocated practical philanthropy. Gradually he abandoned the distinctive tenets of the Anglican church, and in his most mature work, <span class="italic">The Religion of the Universe</span> (1836), he advanced a deistic view of religion which stressed the value of scientific knowledge. He lectured at the opening of the chapel of Barber Beaumont's philosophical institution in 1841.<br>
<br>Fellowes married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Annabella, the daughter of Aeneas Mackenzie; his second wife was Sophia (<i>d</i>. 11 April 1836), the daughter of John Parmenter, of Castle Hedingham, Essex. He died at his home in Dorset Square, London, on 6 February 1847, leaving two daughters and two sons, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 13 February.<br>
