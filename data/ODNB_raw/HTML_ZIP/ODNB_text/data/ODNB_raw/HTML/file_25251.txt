<span class="headword">Shaw,  Henry</span>  (1800&#150;1873), <span class="occ">antiquary and illuminator</span>, was born in London on 4 July 1800; nothing is known of his family or education. A precocious architectural draughtsman, he published details of ornament from English medieval churches in 1823 (<span class="italic">A Series of Details of Gothic Architecture</span>) and supplied John Britton with drawings of Wells Cathedral for plates dated 1824 and 1825 included in the fourth volume of <span class="italic">Cathedral Antiquities</span>, eventually published as a series in 1836; Shaw's view of the interior was remembered as &#145;one of the best plates&#146;  (Britton, 2.134). He contributed to a number of de luxe publications promoted by antiquarian enthusiasts, among them <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Chapel at Luton Park, a Seat of the &hellip; Marquess of Bute</span> (1829&#150;30), <span class="italic">The history and illustrations of a house in the Elizabethan style of architecture, the property of John Danby Palmer</span> (1838), Thomas Alcock Beck's <span class="italic">A Description of Furness Abbey</span> (1845), and, most impressively, William Sidney Gibson's <span class="italic">History of the Monastery Founded at Tynemouth</span> (1846&#150;7).<br>
<br>Shaw marketed prints from these publications from at least June 1830. His prints of details of illuminated manuscripts, artefacts, and ornament of the middle ages and later periods were published by William Pickering. Sets of prints were published as books, the first as <span class="italic">Illuminated ornaments selected from manuscripts and early printed books from the sixth to the seventeenth centuries</span> (1833), with an introduction by Frederic Madden. A similar publishing formula was adopted for other categories of artefact: works on Elizabethan architectural decoration appeared in 1834&#150;5, on medieval furniture in 1836, on ornamental metalwork in 1836, on dresses and decorations of the middle ages in 1843, on alphabets in 1843, and on the medieval decorative arts in general in 1850. Plates were engraved for Shaw and mostly finished with hand-colouring, for which he employed assistants, especially after about 1840. Shaw designed initial letters based on medieval forms that were used in the printing trade. He provided initials and ornament for the prestigious <span class="roman">New Testament</span> published by Longman in 1864 with engravings of works by artists from Fra Angelico to Raphael.<br>
<br>Shaw was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1833. His reproductions of medieval and Renaissance artefacts and manuscripts established standards of finish, colour, and form that the originals themselves had to match to satisfy Victorian taste. By 1845 he had assistants making facsimiles in the British Museum Library under his supervision for sale. John Ruskin was among his customers. In 1866 he organized an exhibition of illuminated drawings, facsimiles of famous illuminated manuscripts dating from the ninth to the sixteenth centuries; the works were sold at Christies on 6 June of that year, prices ranging from &pound;4 to over &pound;90. The South Kensington Museum ordered further copies of works in this sale for its own collections. A review of Shaw's <span class="italic">Handbook of the Art of Illumination</span> (1866) described him as &#145;an authority on a peculiar and most beautiful department of the Arts of the Middle Ages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 28, 1866, 342), one of a group who had brought this art to the attention of the educated public. Shaw justified use of wood-engravings in his <span class="italic">Handbook</span> by its cheapness: he had employed chromolithography in earlier publications, but considered hand-colouring alone capable of faithful reproduction. He is reported to have supplied to order illuminated addresses, documents produced for ceremonial purposes that from the 1860s were offered to honoured persons on public occasions, to celebrate coming of age, marriage, retirement, or official visits.<br>
<br>Shaw's mission was educational as well as antiquarian. His <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Ornament</span> (1842) aimed to provide models for &#145;artist or manufacturer&#146; and to encourage &#145;enlargement of correct taste&#146;. Though lacking a theoretical or systematic approach, this was a precursor of Owen Jones's <span class="italic">Grammar of Ornament</span> (1856), a work that underpinned the national system of design education elaborated by Henry Cole and the South Kensington Museum. In the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Museum of Medieval Art Collected by the Late L. N. Cottingham, FSA, Architect</span> (1850), Shaw expressed the hope that the government might acquire Cottingham's copies either for the School of Design or as the nucleus of a national and medieval museum as a means of improving the education of workmen and designers. The catalogue of his 1866 exhibition states that, &#145;for purposes of instruction, [facsimiles of illuminated manuscripts] &hellip; may &hellip; be considered more satisfactory than the original drawings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catalogue of Illuminated Drawings</span>, 3&#150;4), a point he made to the South Kensington Museum in 1864 when asked to evaluate its collection of &#145;illuminations&#146;.<br>
<br>Shaw died on 12 June 1873 at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. The executors of his will were Alfred Maples Jeaffreson and Edward Warren, the son of his niece and an assistant at the British Museum respectively. The estate was valued at nearly &pound;3000, the chief beneficiaries being Shaw's nieces Mary Warren, Eliza Westropp, Louisa Gray Compton, and Blanche Jeaffreson (the wife of Alfred Jeaffreson and the youngest daughter of Louisa Compton).<br>
