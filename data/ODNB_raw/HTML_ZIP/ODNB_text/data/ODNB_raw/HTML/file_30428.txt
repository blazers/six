<span class="headword">Arber,  Edward</span>  (1836&#150;1912), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 4 December 1836 at 29 George Street, Hanover Square, London, the youngest of five children of Thomas Arber, architect, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Newell). He was educated first in London, then at the Institution Bellaguet, Paris (1852&#150;3,) and King's College School, Strand, London (1853&#150;4). He worked as a clerk in the Admiralty (1854&#150;78), and entered night school at King's College, London, in 1858 where Henry Morley had a lasting influence on him. He became an associate of the college in 1867.<br>
<br>On 4 December 1867 Arber announced a series of the English classics, &#145;designed to place the Masterpieces and the minor works of our mighty Past, in their original dress, within the easy reach of every reader of the English tongue&#146;  (advertisement in Milton's <span class="italic">Areopagitica</span>, 1868). The first <span class="roman">English Reprints</span> (30 vols., 1868&#150;71) &#145;price sixpence: post free, seven stamps&#146;  (ibid.) were published by Alexander Murray &amp; Son, but in January 1869, Arber told W. C. Hazlitt that he no longer had &#145;business transactions&#146; with Murray, &#145;only friendly relations&#146;, and in July he announced to the trade: &#145;Mr Arber is about to publish as well as edit [his <span class="roman">English Reprints</span>] and has taken a house, no. 5 Queen Square &hellip; for the purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, July 1869).<br>
<br>So friendly were the relations between publisher and editor that on 11 August 1869 Arber married Murray's daughter, Marion (<i>b</i>. 1838/9). They had two sons, Edward Newell Arber (<i>d</i>. 1918), a Cambridge palaeobotanist, and Thomas Henry Arber, a clergyman.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">English Reprints</span> were followed by <span class="roman">An English Garner: Ingatherings from our History and Literature</span> (8 vols., 1877&#150;96); <span class="roman">The Scholar's Library of Old and Modern Works</span> (16 vols., 1880&#150;84); <span class="roman">The British Anthologies</span> (10 vols., 1899&#150;1901); <span class="roman">Selections from the English Poets</span> (10 vols., 1901); and finally, <span class="roman">A Christian Library: a Popular Series of Religious Literature</span> (3 vols., 1907), the last of which displayed a fervent evangelical bias. Arber's aim throughout was to spread culture and love of English literature.<br>
<br>On resigning from the Admiralty in 1878, Arber was appointed lecturer in English literature under Morley at University College, London, and when the Mason Science College (later the University of Birmingham) was founded in 1881 he became professor of English. He looked on teaching as an extension of his &#145;share in the great march forward, of the last 15 years in the availability of literature through cheap reprints, I [now] endeavour to carry out this work by <i>speech</i>&#146;  (Arber to Henry Bradshaw, July 1884, CUL, Bradshaw MSS). He started with a mere handful of students&#151;&#145;Birmingham is more scientific than literary&#146;, he told Bradshaw  (ibid.) but he worked with dedication, introduced Old and Middle English texts into the syllabus and in 1891 wrote:<blockquote>Our English department &hellip; now numbers 100 systematic students; to whom I am giving this Session 500 lectures in nine months &hellip; next session the number will be 140 or 150; 100 of whom will be women. Add to this, my share in the Examination of 4000 candidates annually &hellip; at the London University, and I think you will wonder that I have thought or effort for <i>any</i> printing work. (Arber to Bradshaw, 25 Jan 1891, CUL, Bradshaw MSS)</blockquote>Arber was made honorary fellow of King's College, London, in 1880 but in 1889 he failed to obtain the chair of English at University College, London.<br>
<br>Arber resigned from Birmingham in 1894 to return to London and devote his time to research and publishing; Birmingham made him professor emeritus and he continued to examine for Manchester University and King's College, London. For many years he read for his friend James Murray's <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span> and supplied the earliest uses of hundreds of words, technical as well as literary. Arber encouraged the despondent lexicographer in many ways; an enthusiast for new technology, he advised that a typewriter &#145;would keep down the frightful cost of corrections &hellip; I consider this suggestion as good as giving you &pound;100 towards the cost of the dictionary&#146;  (Arber to Murray, 29 Nov 1884, Bodl. Oxf., MSS Murray).<br>
<br>In 1873 Arber took over the task from F. J. Furnival, with limited encouragement from the Stationers' Company, of transcribing the earliest registers and court books (1554&#150;1640), amplifying them by a wealth of contemporary documents in the British Museum, Public Record Office, and elsewhere. He had to decide, against his principles, on a limited edition of 230 copies issued on subscription. Four volumes were in print by 1877, but the final index volume waited until 1894. He then turned to the early booksellers' quarterly lists, the &#145;term catalogues&#146;, which he considered &#145;a continuation of the literary record of &hellip; your Company's Registers, 1553&#150;1640&#146;  (Arber to the master, 1 Oct 1900, Stationers' Company Archives). It was &#145;a great undertaking for a single-handed Scholar to carry out unaided&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Term Catalogues</span>, 1.x) involving the checking of &#145;some 30,000 personal names&#146;  (ibid.) of printers, booksellers, and authors against copies of the books in the British Library, Lambeth Palace Library, the Bodleian Library, and Cambridge University Library. <span class="italic">The Term Catalogues, 1668&#150;1709</span> was privately printed in three volumes (1903&#150;6). In 1905 Oxford made him a DLitt in recognition of his work.<br>
<br>Arber's vast output of cheap reprints of literary works, both the well known and the obscure, filled the kind of student need later supplied by cheap facsimiles, but his reprints were overtaken by more scholarly editions and have become of mainly historical interest. <span class="italic">The Transcript of the Stationers' Registers</span> and <span class="italic">The Term Catalogues</span> are another matter; edited without the guidance and resources now available to scholars, they are, for all their idiosyncratic arrangement and typography, enduring research tools and a monument to Arber.<br>
<br>Edward Arber was knocked down by a taxi on Kensington High Street, London, on 23 November 1912, and died of his injuries on the way to hospital. His burial took place six days later in Putney Vale cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
