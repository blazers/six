<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spedding,  James</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">literary editor and biographer</span>, was born on 26 June 1808 in Mirehouse, Cumberland, the son of John Spedding and Sarah Gibson, eldest daughter of Henry Gibson of Newcastle upon Tyne. After attending grammar school at Bury St Edmunds, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he won a prize for a declamation delivered on commemoration day 1830. Although he was a good classical scholar, and in the second class of the classical tripos of 1831, his greater merits were recognized by his contemporaries. As one of the Apostles at Cambridge, he became a lifelong friend of Lord Houghton, Edward Fitzgerald, Arthur Hallam, Archbishop Trench, W. M. Thackeray, and Alfred Lord Tennyson, who said of Spedding, &#145;He was the Pope among us young men&#151;the wisest man I know&#146;  (Hallam, Lord Tennyson, <span class="italic">Alfred Lord Tennyson: a Memoir by his Son</span>, 1867, 1.38). In 1835, in an appointment made by James Stephen, Spedding entered the Colonial Office where he established a reputation with &#145;quite a genius for business&#146;. The appointment was never made permanent and Spedding left in 1841 and spent the next year in the United States as secretary to the Ashburton commission negotiating a settlement of the boundary dispute between that country and Canada. After that period, Spedding began what was to be his main employment for over thirty years, his edition of the works of Francis Bacon, refusing in 1847 the office of permanent under-secretary of state for the colonies and serving on the civil service commission only when it was first instituted in 1855 and resigning when the office was in working order. The first result of his Bacon studies, <span class="italic">Evenings with a reviewer, or, A free and particular examination of Mr Macaulay's article on Lord Bacon</span>, written in 1845 but not published until 1848, demonstrates a precise method contrasting the generalized attacks and misrepresentations of Macaulay with quiet humour and a shrewd critical faculty which, to a careful reader, make the book more interesting than its rival. By 1847 Spedding had negotiated with Robert Leslie Ellis and D. D. Heath to bring out a complete edition of Bacon. Ellis, the editor of the philosophical works, was soon disabled by illness, leaving completion of his task to Spedding in 1853. Although Heath edited the legal texts, Spedding took on almost all the other editing of <span class="italic">The Letters and the Life of Francis Bacon</span> from 1857 to 1859 and was solely responsible for volumes 8&#150;14 which appeared from 1861 to 1874. As Victorians themselves recognized immediately and all generations have since, Spedding's labour of a lifetime became a model of complete and precise scholarship and editing. If he did not prove Bacon a model hero of the kind Victorians and the nineteenth century tended to worship, he revealed an intelligible Bacon out of careful documentation and critical realism. A new cultural model thus appeared not from the grandeur and dramatic wills the century sought in its heroic models but from unflagging industry (slowed down only about 1863 when Spedding had to take a long rest), familiarity with every possible source of information, and slow but sure-footed judgement based on the most careful balancing of evidence. A new kind of hero thus emerged, the ambiguous and mixed hero of the twentieth century, to which Spedding's scholarship and editing was a clear prelude. Writing to Spedding's close friend the poet and translator Edward Fitzgerald in 1874, Thomas Carlyle, whose heroes tended towards the Victorian ideal, praised the volumes of <span class="italic">The Letters and the Life</span> as &#145;the hugest and faithfullest bit of literary navvy work I have ever met with in this generation&#146; for in these texts, &#145;Bacon is washed clean down to the natural skin&#146; so that, for Carlyle, &#145;There is a grim strength in Spedding, quietly, very quietly, invincible, which I did not quite know of before this book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.175&#150;7). The result of such labour revealed the human figure behind the cultural and scientific origination the Victorians ascribed to Bacon. In one of his brilliant prefaces, to the philosophical and autobiographical work by Bacon in middle age, <span class="italic">De interpretatione naturae proemium</span>, Spedding could be exact about one of Bacon's failures and reveal its ironic genesis in his own greatest talents:<blockquote>Bacon failed to devise a practicable method for the discovery of the Forms of Nature, because he misconceived the conditions of the case; he expected to find the phenomena of nature more easily separable and distinguishable than they really are; a misconception into which a discursive intellect, an enterprising spirit, and a hopeful nature, would most naturally fall.</blockquote>This open understanding of human character was found in Spedding's entire life, whether in his personal relationships or his final essays in his 1879 <span class="italic">Reviews and Discussions, Literary, Political, and Historical not Relating to Bacon</span>, where he discusses the authorship of Fletcher and Shakespeare in the play <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> and reveals not only his ardour for the novels of Jane Austen, for example, but also his liberal politics (although rarely roused to enthusiasm after the Hungarian struggle of 1848&#150;9). In the last year of his life Spedding published <span class="italic">Studies in English History</span> (1881), a volume co-authored by the historian James Gairdner. A lifelong bachelor, he occupied chambers from 1835 until 1864 at 60 Lincoln's Inn Fields, just around the corner from the Public Record Office and only a short walk from the British Museum and library, his main centres of research. For his friends from the whole spectrum of Victorian intellectual society, Spedding's quiet sense of humour and incisive perceptions of their world always made him a delightful companion. Physically noteworthy (as revealed in the Victorian photograph by Julia Margaret Cameron) for his high-domed bald head, he was a good swimmer, walker, and player of archery and billiards, though not a brilliant performer of either. On the resignation of Charles Kingsley in 1869, Spedding was offered the professorship of modern history at Cambridge; in 1874 the university offered him an honorary degree. He refused both, accepting only an honorary fellowship at his beloved Trinity College. From 1864 on, he lived with a niece at Westbourne Grove. On 1 March 1881 Spedding was knocked down by a hansom cab and taken to St George's Hospital, where he died on 9 March. Tennyson, whose poems Spedding read in manuscript and reviewed in 1842 in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and whose early drawing by Spedding appeared in Tennyson's son's biography of the poet, rushed to the hospital but was refused admission. The end of Spedding's life revealed his essential nature. While still conscious, he was characteristically anxious to make it clear that he considered the accident that was killing him due not to the driver, but to his own deafness and carelessness.<br>
