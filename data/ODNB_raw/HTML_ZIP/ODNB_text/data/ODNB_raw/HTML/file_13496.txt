<span class="headword">Holding,  Henry James</span>  (1833&#150;1872), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, the youngest son of Henry Holding, an amateur painter, was born at Salford, Lancashire, in November 1833. At an early age he was employed as a pattern designer to calico printers, but he soon began his career as an artist, following the example of three of his brothers. All the members of the family were artists, but none received any regular art training. While still a teenager he exhibited in Manchester, Liverpool, and London, his favourite subjects being marine landscapes and scenes featuring torrents, which he painted in both oil and watercolours. He was also noted for his historical scenes, especially his Tudor subjects. His last work, <span class="italic">Betws-y-coed</span>, exhibited in 1872, was considered his best. Another highly regarded picture, <span class="italic">Finding of the Body of Rufus by the Charcoal-Burners</span>, was exhibited in 1862. He died of consumption on 9 August 1872 in Paris while on a sketching tour, which had been expected to restore him to health. He was buried in the English cemetery (des.) at Paris. As his death left his wife and children in financial difficulties, an exhibition was held in Manchester for their benefit.<br>
<br>Holding's elder brother <a name="cosubject_13496"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Holding</span>  (1817&#150;1874), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, born probably in Manchester, lived in Manchester for most of his life and painted watercolours, showing much skill in figure drawing. He also worked as an illustrator; the 1864 edition of Robert Southey's <span class="italic">Battle of Blenheim</span> includes some of his designs. Towards the end of his life he was the scene painter at the Theatre Royal and the Prince's Theatre in Manchester. He died in 1874, probably in Manchester. There is a Shakespearian scene by him in Manchester City Galleries.<br>
