<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry Algernon George</span>, Earl Percy  (1871&#150;1909), <span class="occ">politician and traveller</span>, was born at 25 Grosvenor Square, London, on 21 January 1871, the eldest of the six sons of Henry George Percy, Earl Percy (1846&#150;1918), who became the seventh duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Lady Edith Campbell (1849&#150;1913), daughter of the eighth duke of Argyll. Until 1899 he was known as Lord Warkworth. From 1884 to 1889 he attended Eton College, where he won the prize for English verse, and then Christ Church, Oxford, obtaining first-class honours in classical moderations in 1891 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1893. At Oxford he also won the Newdigate prize for English verse in 1892, writing on the subject of St Francis of Assisi.<br>
<br>In the 1895 general election Warkworth stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate for Berwick upon Tweed. But later in that year he was successful at a by-election in South Kensington, and he represented this constituency until his death. In 1895 he also first visited Turkey and the other areas of the Near East which were to form an abiding personal and political interest for him. He travelled to the area again in 1897, and wrote of his experiences in <span class="italic">Notes of a Diary in Asiatic Turkey</span> (1898), in which he stated that he had &#145;no desire to conceal my sympathy with the Turks&#146;  (p. xii). He visited again in 1899, subsequently writing <span class="italic">The Highlands of Asiatic Turkey</span> (1901), in which he began to expound more fully his views on the political situation in the region, concluding his work with the chapter &#145;Wanted, a policy&#146;. Earl Percy (as he was known from 1899, when his father succeeded to the dukedom) promoted an alliance between Germany and Britain over Turkey to promote stability and stem Russian influence.<br>
<br>By the time Percy was invited, in July 1902, by the new prime minister, Balfour, to become parliamentary under-secretary for India, he was acknowledged as &#145;a well-known expert on Middle Eastern problems &hellip; [and] one of the leading Turcophiles on the conservative side&#146;  (Steiner, 59). He moved much more effectively into his area of interest when he was appointed under-secretary to the foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne, the following year. In this role Percy was unusually independent of his chief, particularly in connection with issues related to the Near East. With his perhaps excessive sympathy for Turkey, Percy regarded the issue of Macedonia as &#145;one of the most important with which he had to deal&#146; and he took a &#145;rather different&#146; standpoint on this matter from that being promoted generally within government  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Dec 1909, 11).<br>
<br>Despite disagreements on policy, Percy's talents were well recognized by party leaders. He has been widely credited as the author of the proposal to renew and strengthen the Anglo-Japanese alliance, which resulted in this &#145;decisive step&#146; being taken by the government in 1905  (Monger, 180). After losing office with the fall of the Conservative government in 1905, Percy contributed forcefully to the debates concerning Indian reform; he was particularly concerned to see that Muslims in India were not disadvantaged by proposed electoral arrangements. The committee of the London branch of the All-India Muslim League later expressed their thanks to Percy &#145;whose consistent friendship towards the Musulman subjects of his Majesty had won their grateful regard and esteem&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Jan 1910, 11).<br>
<br>Percy's abilities and his political potential were highly respected both within the Conservative Party and more broadly across the parliament. Balfour said of his &#145;dear friend&#146; that he was &#145;destined to play a very great and leading part in the history of his country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Dec 1909, 7), while the Liberal Asquith described Percy as &#145;one of the most distinguished of the younger men amongst our opponents &hellip; in the first rank as a public and parliamentary speaker. He had shown in office great administrative talents&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Jan 1910, 5). Percy became a trustee of the National Gallery in 1901 and in 1907 received the degree of DCL from the University of Durham. While travelling through France he contracted pneumonia, and he died on 30 December 1909 at the Gare du Nord Hotel, Paris. He was buried in the Lesbury churchyard, near Alnwick, Northumberland, on 4 January 1910. He was unmarried.<br>
