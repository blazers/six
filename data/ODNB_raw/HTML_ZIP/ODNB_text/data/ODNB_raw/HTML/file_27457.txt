<span class="headword">Timberlake,  Henry</span>  (1730&#150;1765), <span class="occ">army officer in America and writer</span>, was born in Hanover county, Virginia, the son of Francis Timberlake and Sarah Austin. He received &#145;almost as good an education as Virginia could bestow&#146; on him  (Timberlake, 5). His father died when he was young and, finding that his inheritance could not support him, he turned first to commerce and then to soldiering. Henry Timberlake joined the &#145;patriot blues&#146; for their campaign of 1756 against the French and their Indian allies but saw no action. In 1758 he was appointed ensign and simultaneously cornet of light horse in the regiment of William Byrd III, with which he saw action against the French at Fort Duquesne. In the following year he served under John Stanwix who put him in command of Ford Burd, also called Fort Necessity, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In spring 1761 he joined Byrd's regiment, which was to relieve the Cherokee siege of Fort Loudon on the Little Tennessee River. When peace had been made the Cherokee asked that an officer visit them: Timberlake volunteered and was sent in the company of Sergeant Thomas Sumter.<br>
<br>They made their way by canoe down the Holston and up the Little Tennessee rivers, a difficult journey of twenty-two days through uncharted waters in territory where hostile Indians were known to move. After arriving at their goal they spent three months with the Overhill Cherokee; Timberlake was the personal guest of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74574/', "Ostenaca")</script>, who saw Timberlake's visit as a chance to recover some of the ground he had lost among the Cherokee to the rival leader Attakullakulla. Timberlake formed an attachment to Ostenaca's daughter Sakinney, who later gave birth to their son, Richard Timberlake.<br>
<br>Ostenaca demanded to go to London to meet the king, as Attakullakulla had done some thirty years earlier. It was agreed that Timberlake and Sumter would accompany Ostenaca and two other Cherokee (Pouting Pigeon and Stalking Turkey) with their interpreter, and the party left in the summer of 1762. The party, less the interpreter who died <i>en route</i>, were f&ecirc;ted in London and had audience with the king, after which the Indians returned immediately to Virginia, leaving behind Timberlake who, now married against his bride's father's wishes, was prevented from returning by lack of funds. Eventually the couple reached America, where Timberlake was promoted lieutenant in the 42nd regiment but put on half pay. This added to his financial woes and he was obliged to sell the land and slaves he had inherited. In 1764 Timberlake accompanied to England a second group of Cherokee who hoped to secure the king's protection against English settlers who were encroaching on their lands. This time the king refused them an audience since they were not chiefs and their mission was unofficial; in March 1765 the party returned home.<br>
<br>In London in 1765 Henry Timberlake published his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. His end seems to have been to raise money, but he pursued it very maladroitly. His tone is querulous and peevish as he constantly seeks to justify his actions and particularly to rebut suggestions that he profited from the visits of the Indians. This was not the way to secure sales, and the book was not reprinted in Britain, though a German and a French translation appeared in 1769 and 1796 respectively (the London edition was reissued on microcard by the perhaps appropriately named Lost Cause Press of Louisville, Kentucky, n.d.). Later authors, however, have valued his memoirs highly for his fine map of the river system of the Overhill country and his often perceptive descriptions of the Cherokee. He says, for example, of the Cherokee custom of burying the dead with their possessions: &#145;This custom was probably introduced to prevent avarice and, by preventing hereditary acquisitions, make merit the sole means of acquiring power, honour and riches.&#146; He then describes how the custom was bolstered and made acceptable by being given a spiritual or, as he had it, a superstitious significance  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 68). He does not casually assume European superiority, writing rather enviously for example, that &#145;The sole occupations of an Indian life, are hunting, and warring abroad and lazying at home. Want is said to be the mother of industry, but their wants are supplied by an easier rate&#146;  (ibid., 76). Robert Southey used the memoirs in compiling his epic <span class="italic">Madoc</span> (1805), which tells of the twelfth-century Welshman supposed to have reached America and encountered the Cherokee.<br>
<br>Timberlake died in London on 30 September 1765, before his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> appeared. His wife survived him and in recognition of his service was in December 1765 granted a full pension despite his having been on half pay at the time of his death. They are not thought to have had children. In 1819 Henry's illegitimate son Richard Timberlake accepted a reserve in Hamilton county, Tennessee, under a treaty with the Cherokee. This treaty enabled individual Cherokee to remain on land which the nation had earlier ceded to Americans. Richard Timberlake and others who accepted the reserves became the core of the eastern band of the Cherokee.<br>
