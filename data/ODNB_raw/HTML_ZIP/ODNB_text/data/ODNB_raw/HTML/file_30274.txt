<span class="headword">Young,  John Radford</span>  (1799&#150;1885), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born in London in April 1799. Little is known of his background. According to <span class="italic">Men of the time</span> his parents were of &#145;humble&#146; status, and he was &#145;almost entirely self-educated&#146;. At an early age he became acquainted with Olinthus Gilbert Gregory, who perceived his mathematical ability and assisted him in his studies. In 1823, while holding a post at a private establishment for deaf people in Walworth Road, Young published <span class="italic">An Elementary Treatise on Algebra</span>, with a dedication to Gregory. Young's prolific output of elementary books contributed to the movement, led by Robert Woodhouse, to disseminate continental methods of mathematical analysis in Britain. Young's works covered subjects which included geometry, trigonometry, calculus, mechanics, equations, mensuration, logarithms, and navigation and nautical astronomy. His <span class="italic">Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry</span> (1833) contained an appendix by Thomas Stephens Davies. His <span class="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Arithmetic</span> (1858) reached ten editions.<br>
<br>In 1833 Young was appointed professor of mathematics at Belfast College. In 1849, on the opening of Queen's College, the presbyterian party which controlled the professorial nominations prevented his reappointment as professor in the new establishment. From that time he devoted himself more completely to the study of mathematical analysis, and made several original discoveries. In 1844 he had discovered and published a proof of Newton's rule for determining the number of imaginary roots in an equation. In 1866 he completed his proof, publishing in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> a demonstration of a principle which in his earlier paper he had assumed as axiomatic. His contributions to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span> included a memoir in 1868 &#145;On the imaginary roots of numerical equations&#146;. In the 1860s, he wrote several theological tracts, such as <span class="italic">Science Elucidative of Scripture and not Antagonistic to it</span> (1863).<br>
<br>Young was married and had at least one child. He died at Peckham on 5 March 1885.<br>
