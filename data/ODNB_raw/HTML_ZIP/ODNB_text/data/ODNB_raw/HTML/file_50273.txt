<span class="headword">Murray,  David</span>  (1842&#150;1928), <span class="occ">lawyer and antiquary</span>, was born at Glasgow on 15 April 1842, the eldest son of David Murray, a writer to the signet in Glasgow, and Ann Hunter Guthrie. He attended Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, and the University of Glasgow from 1857. He graduated MA in 1863 and was apprenticed in a solicitor's office. When he qualified in 1863 he went into partnership with his father's surviving partner George Smith. Four years later he formed a new partnership with David T. Maclay and John A. Spens to form the firm of Maclay, Murray, and Spens&#151;known to generations of Glaswegians as &#145;Delay, Worry and Expense&#146;. The new firm specialized in commercial and property work. In 1872 Murray married Frances Porter (<i>d</i>. 1919), of Broadfield, Renfrewshire, daughter of Arthur Francis Stoddard, a carpet maker. They had a son and three daughters, the youngest of whom was the suffragist and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56247/', "Eunice Guthrie Murray")</script>.<br>
<br>Murray acted as solicitor to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54002/', "Lewis Potter (1807&#150;1881)")</script>, a prominent director of the City of Glasgow Bank. After the bank's collapse in 1878 he prepared Potter's defence against charges of fraud. This involved meticulous research in the bank's archives and the preparation of volumes of exhibits, work much to Murray's taste. The trial early in 1879 was widely reported and Potter was sent to prison for eighteen months. In the wake of the trial Murray, as solicitor to the company, became involved in the immensely complicated task of winding up the bank's affairs and the sequestration of Lewis Potter's own estate. His chief task was to help to reconstruct the New Zealand and Australian Land Co. Ltd Reduced, managed by Potter, and of which the City of Glasgow Bank held a large number of shares as collateral. The company, founded in 1866, was merged with the Canterbury and Otago Association Ltd to form a new New Zealand and Australian Land Company, controlling some 2 million acres in New Zealand and in Australia. The new firm immediately started selling land, disposing of nearly 1 million acres over the next ten years. Murray, as solicitor to the company, was responsible for the Scottish end of all the transactions, along with the management of the remaining properties. This strategy did not solve the company's financial problems and in 1888 Murray had to prepare a massive petition to the High Court in London to reduce the capital further.<br>
<br>This expertise in company law won Murray many company clients, including the Paisley thread manufacturers J. and P. Coats, Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. Ltd, the Dowanhill Estate Company (which became the longest liquidation case in Scottish history), and Wylie and Lochhead, the Glasgow cabinet-makers. As lawyer to J. and P. Coats he was engaged in the registration of patents and trademarks throughout the world, and their protection in the courts. He was the legal adviser when Coats amalgamated with its rival, Clarks of Paisley, in 1896. This commercial work also brought him many private clients, including members of the Coats family, Sir James T. Whitelaw (a Glasgow wine and spirit merchant), Frank Dubs, the Glasgow locomotive builder, and Sir William Arrol, the engineer. He was regularly called on to defend the property interests of his corporate and private clients against proposed legislation, for example the <span class="roman">Glasgow and Suburban Railway Bill</span> in 1887 and the <span class="roman">Glasgow Building Regulations Bill</span> in 1892.<br>
<br>Murray was an expert on Scottish property and building contract law, writing two books on the subject and acting for the Glasgow and South Western Railway in an important contract case between 1908 and 1917 that went to the House of Lords three times. He served as dean of the faculty of procurators in Glasgow from 1895 to 1898. He wrote books on the history of his own profession in the west of Scotland and of accountancy more generally. He was also deeply interested in Scottish history, writing widely in the field and acting as president of the Glasgow Archaeological Society (1895&#150;6 and 1904&#150;7) and vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries in Scotland from 1900 to 1902. A committed member of the Church of Scotland, he served on many committees, particularly those concerned with the reform of church law. He started collecting books when he was eight, and by the end of his life had accumulated a huge library, largely relating to Glasgow and the west of Scotland, and law, mostly bequeathed to the University of Glasgow. He served on the university court from 1896 to 1899 and from 1903 to 1928, where his views were often cautious. He was made an honorary LLD by the university in 1888. In 1927 Murray published his <span class="italic">Memories of the Old College of Glasgow</span>, describing the institution before it abandoned its original site in the High Street. His son, Anthony Stoddard Murray, was killed in March 1918, and his wife died the following year. David Murray died at his home, Moore Park, Cardross, on 2 October 1928, and was buried at Cardross.<br>
