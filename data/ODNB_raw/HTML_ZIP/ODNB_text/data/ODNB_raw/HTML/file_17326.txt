<span class="headword">Macalister,  Arthur</span>  (1818&#150;1883), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born in Glasgow, the son of John Macalister, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scoullar. Trained as a solicitor, in 1839 he emigrated to Australia with his newly wed wife, Elizabeth Wallace Tassie. After holding a couple of minor government posts and running a Sydney store, he began working for a solicitor in Sydney and in 1850 was admitted to practice. He then moved to Ipswich (near Brisbane) and soon entered local politics. He twice failed to win a seat in the New South Wales parliament, but he was a supporter of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales and when this was effected he was elected for Ipswich in the first Queensland parliament in 1860, and quickly became one of the most prominent public men in the colony.<br>
<br>Appointed secretary for lands and works in Robert Herbert's government in 1862, from February to July 1866 Macalister succeeded Herbert as premier. During the next ten years he held various ministerial positions, was premier twice more (1866&#150;7 and 1874&#150;6) and speaker in 1870&#150;71. In 1863 he was largely responsible for establishing the narrow gauge (3 feet 6 inches) for Queensland's railways, with the construction of the line to Toowoomba. He always backed railway extension, but his land policy was more variable. His land act of 1863 allowed pastoralists longer leases on easier terms but, when he was premier in 1875, his ministry's land act restricted pastoral leases in settled areas and encouraged agricultural settlement by resuming much pastoral land. As a liberal, he was critical of cheap imported labour, supporting measures to control both Pacific islanders and Asians. As a Presbyterian, a mason, and chairman of the Board of Education from 1862 to 1867, he opposed sectarian schools, his ministry being responsible for introducing the &#145;secular&#146; <span class="roman">State Education Act</span> in 1875.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Macalister's health was failing and, after an &#145;apoplectic&#146; (or &#145;epileptic&#146;) fit in 1875, he visited England, ostensibly to enquire into the selection of immigrants. While there he was appointed CMG, but in June 1876, three months after his return to Queensland, he resigned as premier. He was then appointed agent-general, based in London, acting as Queensland commissioner at the Philadelphia International Exhibition on the way over. He resigned this post in November 1881 and returned to the neighbourhood of Glasgow where he died, bankrupt, on 23 March 1883. Known as Slippery Mac, he often broke his promises and changed his attitudes and allegiances, but he was an able administrator as well as an astute politician and his tergiversations were no greater than those of many others. His wife died in Brisbane on 14 September 1894, survived by two sons and three daughters out of their nine children.<br>
