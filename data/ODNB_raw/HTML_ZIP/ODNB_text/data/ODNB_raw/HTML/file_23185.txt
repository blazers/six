<span class="headword">Rawlin,  Richard</span>  (1686/7&#150;1757), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was probably the son of Richard Rawlin, the dissenting minister at Linton, Cambridgeshire, and subsequently at St Neot's, Huntingdonshire, and Stroud, Gloucestershire. He received his ministerial training at the small private academy run by William Payne at Saffron Walden. After completing his studies there he was appointed domestic chaplain to the family of Andrew Warner of Badmondisfield, Suffolk, where he also ministered to a congregation meeting in a registered barn on Warner's estate. In 1716 he accepted the invitation to become pastor of the Independent meeting at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, commencing his ministry there on 5 November. He was a popular preacher and has been described by Walter Wilson as &#145;a judicious, practical and experimental devine; a serious, affectionate and solid preacher&#146;  (Wilson, 2.456). According to the <span class="roman">Evans List</span> he had a congregation of 600 hearers and 40 county voters. He remained at Bishop's Stortford until 1730 when he succeeded Thomas Tingey as minister at the Independent meeting in Fetter Lane, London.<br>
<br>Rawlin continued as minister at Fetter Lane for the remainder of his life. After he had been there for two years a new and larger meeting-house was built for him on the opposite side of the street. The congregation continued to grow and a succession of ministers was engaged to assist Rawlin. The first was John Farmer, followed by Edward Hitchen and finally Edward Hickman. In 1738 Rawlin was chosen to succeed Robert Bragge as one of the six Merchants lecturers at Pinners' Hall. His first contribution was a series of seven sermons on the doctrine of justification. These were subsequently published under the title <span class="italic">Christ the Righteousness of the People</span> (1741), which ran to several editions. However, this was one of only two published works by Rawlin, the other being an address delivered at the ordination of Thomas Gibbons at Haberdashers' Hall in 1743.<br>
<br>Rawlin died in St John's Square, London, on 15 December 1757 and was buried in the same vault in Bunhill Fields as his wife (1693&#150;1749), a daughter of Joseph Brooksbank of Hackney, who had died in 1749. His funeral sermon was preached by John Guyse at the chapel in New Broad Street.<br>
