<span class="headword">Cobham,  John</span>, third Baron Cobham of Cobham  (<em>c.</em>1320&#150;1408), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65264/', "John Cobham, second Lord Cobham of Cobham (d. 1355)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52781/', "Cobham family")</script>], and his first wife, Joan, daughter of John, first Lord Beauchamp of Somerset. He came from the senior branch of the family at Cobham, Kent, noted for public service since the days of Henry II. He was first summoned to parliament in September 1355 on his father's death. His wife, Margaret, the eldest child of Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon, and Margaret de Bohun, was betrothed to him in 1333 (when he may have been thirteen and she six years of age) and the couple probably married in 1345: records show property was settled on them at these times. Margaret died in 1395, and their only child, Joan, predeceased them leaving a daughter, also Joan. One of Cobham's brothers-in-law was William Courtenay, archbishop of Canterbury (1381&#150;96).<br>
<br>Cobham became a prominent national figure. He was frequently a judge in the court of chivalry, notably at the Scrope&#150;Grosvenor trial in May 1389, and in 1392 in the Lovel&#150;Morley dispute. He was regularly a trier of petitions for England from 1379 and for Gascony from 1382. In 1363 he was given safe conduct to Calais to take charge of hostages who had broken parole. Few records remain of his military career, but he served in France in 1359&#150;60, 1366&#150;7, and 1369 (perhaps frequently until 1377); he was probably made a banneret in 1353, and confirmed in 1370 with an annuity of 100 marks. In 1378 he was a member of the commission appointed to receive the castle of Brest from the duke of Brittany.<br>
<br>Cobham frequently went on embassies. He was ambassador to the curia in June 1367 to promote the marriage of Prince Lionel with Violante Visconti and William Wykeham's appointment as bishop of Winchester, and to question the pope's deprivation of the king's clerks' benefices. He was frequently appointed to treat for peace with France: he accompanied John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, to negotiate a year's truce in February and September 1375 (remaining in Bruges over the winter), and went on similar embassies in June 1376, and October 1377, April 1379, May and December 1381, and February and June 1392. He accompanied Gaunt to treat for peace with the count of Flanders in 1383; in September 1379 and in April 1380 he was engaged in negotiations for a royal marriage alliance with France.<br>
<br>Cobham's most important political involvement was as adviser to the young Richard II, to his own ultimate disadvantage. On 17 July 1377 he was elected by the lords to a continual council set up to advise the ten-year-old king and raise money for the French wars; Cobham advanced &pound;100. He was paid &pound;40 for his service and dropped from the council in October, but in April 1379, at the Commons' request, a committee of ten, including Cobham, was appointed, &#145;to examine the estate of the king&#146;  (Tout, <span class="italic">Admin hist.</span>, 3.347) and among other matters, the royal household expenses. From June 1379 to February 1380, moreover, Cobham was appointed &#145;to remain in the household for the safeguard of the king's person&#146;  (Tout, <span class="italic">Admin hist.</span>, 3.349). In 1385 and 1390 he was appointed to supervise payments by crown officials. His most significant appointment was to the commission of thirteen, deeply resented by Richard II, which was set up by parliament in November 1386 with powers that virtually gave it control of government for a year.<br>
<br>Parliament continued to place much confidence in Cobham's discretion. He was supervisor of the collection of the subsidy of 1385 and controller of the subsidy of 1390. In the crisis of 1387&#150;8 he was first one of the intermediaries between the king and the lords, and then one of five lords spiritual and secular appointed in January 1388 for the king's continual guidance. The Westminster chronicle claims that during the Merciless Parliament of February 1388, it was Cobham and the duke of Gloucester who dragged Chief Justice Sir Robert Tresilian from a house within the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey to parliament, where he was condemned to execution. In March, at Richard's request, Cobham interceded unsuccessfully with the Commons for the life of Sir Simon Burley, the king's former tutor, because he was so ill; however, Burley was executed in May, and Cobham signed the order. In March Cobham was appointed to a committee of five who were to attend continually on the king until parliament met again in September: Richard was to do nothing without their consent, and Cobham was to oversee the king's personal affairs. In May 1388 Cobham was appointed by the king to sell manors and goods forfeited by those sentenced in parliament.<br>
<br>It has been suggested that Cobham sided with the lords appellant in 1388 because he resented Burley's growing power in Kent. But Cobham also had connections with the royal party: the father of one of his major feoffees, Arnald Savage, had been in the household of Richard's mother, Joan of Kent, and he himself had been one of her executors in 1385, while his cousin John Cobham of Hever was a king's esquire by August 1388. However, he had family associations with the appellants too; his wife's mother, like Bolingbroke's wife, was a Bohun, and in 1380 his cousin Reginald Cobham of Sterborough married into the family of the earl of Arundel. For over forty years from the 1350s Cobham was heavily engaged in local government in Kent, where he was a major landowner. He served regularly as a JP (in 1385 and 1386 alongside Geoffrey Chaucer), a commissioner of array, a commissioner of oyer and terminer, and a commissioner for the defence of the realm, responsible for protecting the Thames estuary marshes against French invasion. In 1367 he was granted an annual fair and weekly market at Cobham itself, and he financed and supervised much building work, both of his own property and elsewhere. In 1381, following the French and Spanish raid on the Thames estuary in 1379, he obtained licence to crenellate his manor house at Cooling, near Gravesend, for the realm's defence. It was completed in 1385. The architect Henry Yevele prepared plans and was quantity surveyor for the gatehouse (1381&#150;4), on which an inscription in Kentish dialect survives:<blockquote>
<div>Knouwyth that beth and schul be<br>
</div>
<div>That I am mad in help of the cuntre<br>
</div>
<div>In knowyng of whyche thyng<br>
</div>
<div>Thys is chartre and wytnessyng.<br>
</div> (Robertson, 134)</blockquote>With Yevele, Cobham supervised the restoration of the walls of Canterbury in 1385, and used Yevele's designs for restorations in 1381 to the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, near Cobham's town house in Tower Street.<br>
<br>In 1383 Cobham and Yevele were on the commission of inquiry for rebuilding the recently collapsed wooden bridge at Rochester, which was rebuilt between 1388 and 1391 in Kentish ragstone, supervised and financed by Cobham and Sir Robert Knolles. Knolles was with Cobham when Brest was taken under English control in 1378, and his London inn in Seething Lane was near Cobham's. Cobham formed a consortium including two relatives to acquire properties to endow the bridge, and at his own expense built a bridge chapel at the Rochester end in 1392, endowed as a chantry in 1395: his wife was among the deceased commemorated. In 1362 he refounded the parish church of Cobham, endowing it as a chantry college of priests; Cobham College was dissolved in 1535, but refounded on the same site in 1598 as an almshouse, still in use, by William Brooke, Lord Cobham, a descendant in the female line.<br>
<br>Cobham was still attending parliament in the 1390s, and was at a great council held at Eltham in 1395. In the Shrewsbury parliament on 28 January 1398 he was impeached and accused of membership of the commission of 1386, and of sending Sir Simon Burley and Sir James Berners to execution without the king's assent and in his absence. He defended himself on both counts: he was not guilty of making the commission of 1386 and had acted on it by the king's command&#151;to which Richard responded that he had himself acted under constraint&#151;and he had been told that the executions were the king's will. Gower commends his frankness; he says that Cobham was taking &#145;refuge&#146; with the Carthusians when arrested in September 1397, but he was probably at the cell of Nutley Abbey in Maiden Bradley, where his chaplain was held during his imprisonment. He was sentenced to be drawn, hanged, beheaded, and quartered, forfeited and disinherited. Richard II, however, commuted the death sentence to banishment for life, with his cousin Reginald Cobham of Sterborough, to Jersey; if he escaped, the sentence would have full effect. By this date Cobham was about eighty, and responded that eternal life meant more to him than the reprieve. Cobham's banishment was one of the articles in Richard's indictment in 1399.<br>
<br>When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in June 1399 and claimed the throne, Cobham was recalled. The Monk of Evesham's statement that Cobham landed at Ravenspur with Henry may, however, refer to Reginald. By October John Cobham had returned, and he spoke at length in parliament of the need to punish those responsible for the evils of recent times, declaring that under Richard the English had sunk even lower than the heathens; the king had been rightly deposed and parliament should judiciously determine punishment for him and his counsellors. Disclaiming any desire for revenge for himself, according to Thomas Walsingham he observed: &#145;I stand for common justice and declare that if my own father who engendered me were guilty of crimes like these, I would without hesitation declare to you that he should be punished for them&#146;  (&#145;Annales Henrici quarti&#146;, 307). He was present at Richard's abdication.<br>
<br>In 1403 Cobham was executor for Reginald Cobham of Sterborough, and attended parliament in 1406 to subscribe to the entailing of the crown on Henry IV's sons. He died in the severe winter of 1407&#150;8, on 10 January in Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, where he had lived very simply. He was buried in Cobham church, where his monumental brass shows him in armour and bearing a model of Cobham collegiate church, with an inscription recording his role as founder. The heir to Cobham's estate, consisting of lands, rents, and advowsons in Kent, Wiltshire, Surrey, and London, was his granddaughter, Joan, in her own right Lady Cobham. She married five times. The fourth of her husbands (whom she married in 1409), was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20674/', "Sir John Oldcastle")</script>, the Lollard; he took the title Lord Cobham in his wife's right, and has sometimes been confused with the third baron. John Gower called Cobham &#145;noble, long-suffering, compassionate and kindly, efficient and fair-minded, firm in strength of character &hellip; a true friend of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 326), and for Walsingham he was &#145;straightforward and unaffected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ypodigma Neustriae</span>, 379).<br>
