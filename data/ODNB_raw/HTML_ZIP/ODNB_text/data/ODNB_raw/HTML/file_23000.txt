<span class="headword">Rae,  Alexander</span>  (1782&#150;1820), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London in May 1782. After the death of his father in 1787 he was educated under the Revd W. Lloyd, and in his sixteenth year entered the office of a Mr Campbell, an army and East India agent in the Adelphi. He was offered by his employer an appointment in India, which he declined. Instead he decided to adopt the theatrical profession, and made his first appearance at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. In 1806 he set out for Bath with an introduction from Richard Cumberland to Dimond, the manager of the Bath theatre. His first appearance there was on 28 January 1806 as Hamlet, a part which remained his favourite and which he was said to play with a beautiful settled melancholy. Rae also performed in Bath as Octavian in George Colman's <span class="italic">The Mountaineers</span>, Wilding in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Liar</span>, and Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. His good looks and pleasing style, rather than any conspicuous display of talent, recommended him to Colman, who engaged him for the Haymarket, where he appeared on 9 June 1806 as Octavian.<br>
<br>During the season, besides repeating Hamlet, Rae played Gondibert in <span class="italic">The Battle of Hexham</span>, Count Almaviva in <span class="italic">The Spanish Barber</span>, Captain Beldare in <span class="italic">Love Laughs at Locksmiths</span>, Frederick in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, and Sir Edward Mortimer in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, and was the original Edward in Dibdin's <span class="italic">Five Miles off is the Finger Post</span>, a part in which he was badly received. He was said at the time to have been genteel, with an expressive face but a bad voice, to have caught something from Kemble and more from Elliston, and to have the vice of expressing strong passion by hysterical &#145;guzzles&#146; in the throat. At the close of the season he went to Liverpool, where he stayed for four years, declining invitations from the Lyceum and from America. In Liverpool he played the lead both in tragedy and comedy, except for a time when he supported John Kemble. Rae won some commendation from Sarah Siddons, with whom he frequently acted. In the slack season he often visited Dublin and Scotland.<br>
<br>In November 1812, as Rae from Liverpool, he made, on the introduction of Mrs Siddons, his first appearance at Drury Lane, playing Hamlet. Norval in <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, Romeo, George Barnwell, and Hastings in <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> followed, and in January 1813 he was well received as the original Don Ordonio in Coleridge's <span class="italic">Remorse</span>. He was Bassanio to the Shylock of Edmund Kean on the latter's first appearance at Drury Lane, and also Othello to his Iago and Macduff to his Macbeth; when, in February 1814, Kean played Richard III for the first time, Rae was Richmond. Rae later played Horatio in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Norfolk in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, Hotspur, Alonzo in Edward Young's <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>, Ford in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Francesco in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">The Duke of Milan</span>, and Rashleigh Osbaldistone in the first production of <span class="italic">Rob Roy the Greygaract</span>, Soame's adaptation from Scott (March 1818). He is last traced at Drury Lane on 19 June 1820, when he played Irwin in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Everyone has his Fault</span>.<br>
<br>On the death of Raymond some few years previously, Rae became stage-manager at Drury Lane. After the promotion he left his home and family to live with an actress who induced him to make what proved a crowning mistake. He quit Drury Lane and undertook in 1820 the management of the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, where he opened as Sir Edward Mortimer in Colman's <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>. Here he played the tragic parts of which at Drury Lane Kean had dispossessed him. The experiment was a failure, salaries were unpaid, and Rae was ruined. He then underwent an operation from which he never recovered. Attended by his wife, he died on 8 September 1820. He left a son and two daughters, one of whom also went on the stage, working mainly in Edinburgh. A performance for the benefit of his widow and three children was given at Drury Lane in October 1820.<br>
<br>Rae's most pronounced gift was elegance; he had penetration and judgement, but lacked intensity and inspiration. He was handsome, about 5 feet 7 inches in height, dark-haired and a little bald, a fair singer, a good fencer, and from all accounts a fascinating companion.<br>
