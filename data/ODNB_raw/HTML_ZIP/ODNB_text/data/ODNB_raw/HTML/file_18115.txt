<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsh,  Narcissus</span>  (1638&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born on 20 December 1638 at Hannington, near Highworth, Wiltshire, the son of William Marsh, who owned an estate worth &pound;60 p.a., and Grace Colburn. He was the youngest of his family, with two brothers and two sisters. He was educated in a series of five local schools and noted in his diary that &#145;in all of which schools I was never so much as once whipt or beaten&#146;. At sixteen he was entered as a commoner at Magdalen Hall in Oxford. He studied &#145;Old philosophy, Mathematics and Oriental languages&#146;, graduated BA (1658), was elected to a Wiltshire fellowship in Exeter College (1658), and proceeded MA (1660), BD (1667), and DD (1671), being incorporated at Cambridge in 1678. As an undergraduate he reported that he kept &#145;an entire fast every week, from Thursday, six o'clock at night, until Saturday, eleven at noon, for which God's name be praised&#146;, though possibly only during Lent.<h2>
<a name="Clericalcareerandwritings"></a>Clerical career and writings</h2>Marsh was under age when ordained priest by the bishop of Oxford in March 1662 and, troubled, noted &#145;The Lord forgive us both, but then I knew no better but it might be legally done&#146;. Appointed chaplain to Seth Ward, bishop of Exeter, who offered him the living of Swindon, he discovered he was expected to marry a daughter of a friend of the bishop. He was horrified, as he had no intention of ever marrying. Ward, furious, demanded his resignation as his chaplain. Marsh thanked God &#145;for delivering me out of the snare which they laid for me&#146; and returned to Oxford. In 1664 he delivered his first sermon, at St Mary's, Oxford, and in 1665 was made proproctor of the university. He learned to play the bass viol and reported that &#145;after the Fire of London, I constantly kept a weekly consort (of instrumental musick and sometimes vocal) in my chamber on Wednesday in the afternoon, and then on Thursday, as long as I lived in Oxford&#146;. He worked even harder at his studies but felt guilty over his recreation&#151;&#145;Yet O Lord I beseech Thee to forgive me this loss of time and vain conversation.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1665 Marsh was appointed chaplain to Lord Chancellor Hyde who advised him to continue with his studies. At this period &#145;he had many advantageous offers for marriage&#146;, &#145;one who had &pound;800, to her portion, another &pound;1500, another &pound;2400 and another of meaner fortune than either, but all very desirable (I might rather have said beautiful lovely persons)&#146;. He was not tempted by these offers and also refused appointment as domestic chaplain to the lord keeper, Orlando Bridgeman, in order to continue his studies. Instead he was interrupted by agreeing to the request of the vice-chancellor, Dr Fell, to revise the notes and supervise the printing of Belsamon's and Zonaras's <span class="italic">Comments on the Canons of the Greek Councils</span> (1672), a monumental task which took almost a year. He had earlier gained some experience of this type of work when he revised Du Trieu's <span class="italic">Logick</span> (1662), which he later had published for the benefit of Dublin University students as <span class="italic">Institutio logicae in usum juventutis academicae Dubliniensis</span> (1679). He also wrote an &#145;Essay touching the sympathy between lute or viol strings&#146;, printed by Robert Plot in his <span class="italic">Natural History of Oxfordshire</span> (1676). In 1673 Fell and the chancellor, the duke of Ormond, appointed him principal of St Alban Hall. His success in this position, and his administrative and organizational abilities, encouraged Ormond and Fell, now bishop of Oxford, to suggest his appointment as provost of Trinity College, Dublin.<h2>
<a name="CareerinIreland"></a>Career in Ireland</h2>Marsh was invested as provost on 24 January 1679. He recorded in his diary his<blockquote>finding this place very troublesome partly by reason of the multitude of business and impertinent visits the Provost is obliged to, and partly by reason of the ill education the young Scholars have before they come to College, whereby they are both rude and ignorant; I was quickly weary of 340 young men and boys in this lewd and debauch'd town; and the more so because I had no time to follow my allways dearly beloved studies.</blockquote>Despite his complaint he oversaw some important changes in the college, including the building of a new hall and chapel. He reorganized the library, improving the classification, shelving, and numbering of books, revising the regulations, and demanding greater accountability from the junior fellow annually appointed as librarian, but he was unable to change the statutes which entitled only the provost and fellows to study there unattended.Marsh discovered that under the statutes thirty of the seventy scholars chosen each year had to be natives, and that while these scholars could speak Irish they could not read or write it. He employed, at his own expense, a former Catholic priest, Paul Higgins, to teach Irish and to preach in Irish once a month. The lectures and sermons, which he attended, were a great success but were severely criticized for promoting the Irish language, among others by the primate, who drew attention to an act of parliament to abolish the language. Marsh ignored these warnings and continued with his work.<br>
<br>Marsh's next project at Trinity College was the preparation for printing of Bishop William Bedell's Irish translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. With the help of a number of associates he prepared the transcripts which they then sent to Robert Boyle in London. Marsh gives an interesting description of their work:<blockquote>when a quantity of sheets was transcribed, I got Dr Sall, Mr Higgins, Mr Mullen and some gentlemen well skilled in Irish to compare the transcript with the original copy, then to render the Irish into English, whilst I had the Polyglott <span class="roman">Bible</span> before me, to observe whether it came up to the original [Hebrew] and where any doubt did arise, after a debate, and their agreement upon a more proper expression, twas written in the margin, and left to Mr Boyle to advise with Mr Reilly thereupon. But I think very few alterations were made in the impression. (<span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span>)</blockquote>The Irish translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was printed in London in 1685. Marsh's interest in the Irish language, which had led him at one time to attempt the publication of an Irish grammar, was mainly with a purpose to propagate the reformed religion through the language of the majority in Ireland.<br>
<br>On 6 May 1683 Marsh was consecrated bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, with the rectory of Killeban <i>in commendam</i>. Before he took up his appointment he became a member of the newly formed Dublin Philosophical Society and contributed a paper, &#145;An introductory essay to the doctrine of sounds, containing some proposals for the improvement of acousticks&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (1684). Although the Oxford Philosophical Society thought the article of &#145;great consequence&#146;, a later assessment notes few original conclusions but points to Marsh's use of new words&#151;&#145;diacoustics&#146; to describe the study of refracted sound and &#145;catacoustics&#146; for that of reflected sound, and his being the first scientific writer to use the word &#145;microphone&#146;  (Hoppen). Marsh was also interested in comets and scientific instruments, and invented a lamp to enlighten a large hall or church. To William Molyneux, who had invented the Dublin hygroscope for indicating moisture in the air, he suggested substituting a lute string for the more fragile whipcord Molyneux was using. He tried to discover a more reliable and logical method of insect classification, incorporating classification by follicles and aurelias. Some years later he was made a vice-president of the Dublin Philosophical Society.<br>
<br>Marsh did not stay long in his diocese. Following the accession of James II he was subjected to threats by disorderly soldiery and, after briefly staying in Trinity College, fled to England. In 1690 he preached before Queen Mary at Whitehall and before the University of Oxford. Bishop Lloyd of St Asaph appointed him vicar of Gresford, Denbighshire, and he was made a canon of St Asaph. He noted the hospitality and financial assistance he received in England, and in return assisted many of his fellow clergymen. In his diary Marsh recorded:<blockquote>my time for many days have been in hard study, especially in knotty Algebra, to divert melancholy thoughts these sad calamitous times wherein I am forced to live from home; and do hear almost every day of the murther of some [or] other Protestant, yet my heart and hope is always steadfastly fixed on the Lord my God and I trust it shall never be moved.</blockquote>He gives vivid accounts of his dreams, illustrating his fear of the pope and the Catholic church. In August 1690 he returned to Ireland and was promoted archbishop of Cashel in February 1691.<br>
<br>As archbishop Marsh forbade preaching in private houses, warned clergy not to praise the dead overmuch, and laid down that every incumbent should preach every Sunday. He worked extremely hard in his diocese and recorded long, difficult journeys to visit and inspect his clergy and parishes. If he was distressed at the consecration of William Fitzgerald as bishop of Clonfert, glad he did not participate and noting &#145;may I never be concerned in bringing unworthy men into the Church&#146;, he was obviously pleased at the consecration a few weeks later of Nathaniel Foy, who would prove an influential bishop of Waterford and Lismore.<br>
<br>Marsh was translated to Dublin in 1694 and enthroned on 26 May. On six occasions between 1699 and 1711 he served as one of the lords justices&#151;effective governors in the absence of the lord lieutenant. To this involvement in &#145;worldly business&#146;, which he hated, was added his service in the House of Lords, including membership of the committee for religion and grievances, and chairmanship of the committee for temporary acts. He appears to have taken a leading part in the drafting of legislation in 1697 including the <span class="roman">Banishment Act</span>, directed against Catholic bishops and regular clergy, the act against intermarriage of protestants and Catholics, and the act confirming the treaty of Limerick. He was unsympathetic towards the Limerick articles, fearing &#145;the effect of the unhappy conditions that (I know not how or why) have been granted to a rebellious people that were not able to defend themselves&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1703 Thomas Emlyn, removed by his fellow Presbyterians from his ministry for unitarian views, was charged with publishing a blasphemous book; Marsh sat on the bench at the trial. Emlyn was sentenced to a year's imprisonment with the condition he not be released until he had paid a &pound;1000 fine. When, after two years, his friends secured the reduction of the fine to &pound;70, Marsh demanded a shilling in the pound of the original fine as queen's almoner, though he was eventually persuaded to a reduction to &pound;20. He personally instituted a case against a Mr Fleming, Presbyterian minister at Drogheda, but the case was withdrawn due to the then government's sympathetic policy to dissenters. In contrast to his treatment of Catholics and Presbyterians he was sympathetic towards Huguenots, some of whom had been given permission to worship in the lady chapel in St Patrick's Cathedral, on condition they were bound by the discipline and canons of the Church of Ireland. Yet Marsh approved and praised the alternative discipline, with a much more liberal interpretation of conformity, which the French congregation prepared and submitted to him.<h2>
<a name="FoundationofMarshsLibraryandreputation"></a>Foundation of Marsh's Library and reputation</h2>When at Trinity College, Marsh wrote to his friend Dr Thomas Smith that the booksellers' shops were furnished with nothing but &#145;new Triffles and Pamphlets and not well with them&#146;. He noted the lack of a library for the public in the capital and that<blockquote>twas this and this consideration alone that at first mov'd me to think of building a library in some other Place (than in the College) for publick use, where all might have free access, seeing they cannot have it in the college. (<span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span>, 764)</blockquote>Almost twenty years later he had the opportunity, building his library in the grounds of the palace of St Sepulchre, which he held as archbishop. Designed by the surveyor-general of Ireland, Sir William Robinson, it was influenced by the design of the Bodleian Library and was furnished with dark oak bookcases each with carved and lettered gable topped by a mitre. Four main collections were obtained, the most important being the library of nearly 10,000 books of Edward Stillingfleet, bishop of Worcester, which Marsh bought for his library in 1705 for &pound;2500. He donated his own books, reflecting his special interest in books in Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew, Russian, and oriental languages, but bequeathed his oriental manuscripts to the Bodleian. The first librarian at Marsh's Library, a Huguenot refugee, Dr Elias Bouh&eacute;reau, donated his books, mainly relating to France, on his appointment in 1701, and in 1745 John Stearne, bishop of Clogher, bequeathed his collection to Marsh's Library.<br>
<br>In February 1703 Marsh was promoted to the Irish primacy. In Armagh he repaired the cathedral and rebuilt churches at his own expense. He bought in impropriated tithes and restored them to the church, and instituted and largely endowed the almshouses for the widows of clergymen in the Armagh diocese. He also contributed large sums of money to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He died on 2 November 1713 and was buried four days later in the churchyard of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, adjoining his library. The large monument erected to him, the work of Grinling Gibbons, was damaged by the weather, and in 1728 the governors and guardians of the library decided to move it inside the cathedral.<br>
<br>Marsh's contemporaries took a fairly sympathetic view of him. Archbishop William King thought Marsh &#145;though an excellent person and a scholar is yet too modest and unacquainted with the world&#146;  (McCarthy, 21), while the bishop of Oxford described him as a man of &#145;learning, virtue, gravity and diligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Church of Ireland Gazette</span>, 9 Dec 1927, 714). The exception was Jonathan Swift, who blamed Marsh for his having to produce his &#145;penitential letter&#146; for his lack of promotion in the church and, unfairly, for removing him from the management of the petition for first fruits for the church just short of success. Swift, a member of the lower house of convocation, unsuccessfully opposed the act setting up Marsh's Library on the grounds that laymen on the library's governing board might become a majority and have authority over the precentor or treasurer of St Patrick's, to one of which posts that of librarian was to be annexed. About 1710 Swift wrote a spiteful &#145;Character of Primate Marsh&#146;:<blockquote>Doing good is his pleasure; and as no man consults another in his pleasures, neither does he in this &hellip; without all passions but fear, to which of all others he hath the least temptation, having nothing to get or to lose; no posterity, relation, or friend to be solicitous about; and placed by his station above the reach of fortune or envy. &hellip; He is the first of the human race, that with great advantages of learning, piety and station ever escaped being a great man. (McCarthy, 26)</blockquote>Whatever Marsh's failings he was, in great contrast to many of his contemporaries, an exemplary prelate, pious, and sincere&#151;if not effective&#151;as a reformer. He is remembered for his generosity in building the first public library in Ireland, one of the few eighteenth-century buildings in Dublin still used for its original purpose.<br>
