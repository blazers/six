<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oakeley, Sir  Herbert Stanley</span>  (1830&#150;1903), <span class="occ">composer and organist</span>, was born on 22 July 1830 at the vicarage, Ealing, the second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20424/', "Revd Sir Herbert Oakeley, third baronet (1791&#150;1845)")</script>, and his wife, Atholl Keturah Murray (1801&#150;1844), the daughter of Lord Charles Murray Aynsley (whose father was John, third duke of Atholl) and his wife, Alicia. Educated at Rugby School (1843&#150;6) and at Christ Church, Oxford, he graduated BA in 1853 and proceeded MA in 1856. A talented keyboard player, he took lessons in harmony at Oxford from Stephen Elvey, organist of New College. Though his intention had been to take holy orders in the Church of England, music came to occupy him more and more. Visits to Canterbury, Durham, Norwich, and Winchester confirmed in him a love for cathedral music. His circumstances enabled him to travel widely: he studied the piano with Ignaz Moscheles and Louis Plaidy (Leipzig, 1855) and organ with Johann Schneider (Dresden, 1863), and met leading musicians including Liszt and Meyerbeer. As music critic of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> from 1858 to 1868 he wrote on musical events at home and abroad.<br>
<br>In 1865, to the surprise of many in the musical world, Oakeley was appointed Reid professor of the theory of music at the University of Edinburgh in succession to John Donaldson. A carriage accident in the Swiss Alps in June 1872 left his right leg permanently impaired, although he continued to give organ recitals and conduct. He was knighted on 17 August 1876, following the unveiling of the Albert memorial in Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, at which he directed the music: Queen Victoria observed that &#145;Professor Oakeley &hellip; is a wonderful musician, and plays beautifully on the organ&#146;  (Victoria, 327). On 19 September 1881 she conferred on him the title of &#145;Composer of Music to Her Majesty in Scotland&#146;. His first music degree was a doctorate from the archbishop of Canterbury (1871). Later he received honorary degrees from many universities; other honours included membership of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna (1888) and the Accademia di Santa Cecilia of Rome (1892).<br>
<br>Oakeley directed the resources of the Reid chair towards &#145;the promulgation of musical art&#146; in Scotland. An excellent organist with a flair for improvisation, he gave 200 recitals between 1866 and 1891 on the fine organ by William Hill &amp; Sons (1861, rebuilt 1869) in his classroom. Under his administration the Reid memorial concerts were transformed into artistic events of high quality, at which many major works received their first performances in Scotland. In 1867&#150;8 August Manns was engaged to conduct; from 1869 to 1891 the concert became the centrepiece of a Reid festival given by Charles Hall&eacute; and his orchestra. Soloists included Clara Schumann, Alfredo Piatti, Therese Tietjens, and George Henschel; a piece by Oakeley was usually included in the programme. Another innovation was the founding of Edinburgh University Musical Society. From 1871 Oakeley conducted annual concerts of its male students' chorus and a semi-professional orchestra. He also encouraged the formation of similar societies at Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Glasgow. When in 1876&#150;7 John Stuart Blackie attacked him in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> for neglecting Scottish song he responded with his <span class="italic">National Melodies</span>, dedicated to the university musical societies of Scotland. The <span class="italic">Scottish Students' Song Book</span> (1891) owed much to his enthusiasm, and includes his songs for Edinburgh (&#145;Alma mater&#146;, 1884) and St Andrews (&#145;Carmen saeculare&#146;, 1890).<br>
<br>Oakeley's efforts to develop music as an academic subject at Edinburgh made less headway. Classes were held (including from 1884 one for women) and certificates awarded, but comparatively few students enrolled. In his inaugural lecture (1866) Oakeley looked forward to the time when students might matriculate &#145;for the especial purpose of obtaining aid in cultivating music, and to <i>graduate</i> in that subject&#146;  (Oakley, 23&#150;4), and he argued the case for musical degrees before the Scottish universities commissioners in 1877 and 1890; but the syllabus eventually introduced in 1894 was Niecks's, not his. Ill health and increasing deafness, coupled with the impending institution of music degrees and Sir Charles Hall&eacute;'s decision to withdraw from the Reid concerts, precipitated Oakeley's early retirement from his professorship in 1891. During his last years he lived in Dover, but continued to travel. He died at 53 Grand Parade, Eastbourne, on 26 October 1903 and was buried at Eastbourne parish church.<br>
<br>As a composer Oakeley won respect as &#145;an earnest and conscientious artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, 17, 1875&#150;6, 206). But apart from hymn tunes such as &#145;Abends&#146; and &#145;Dominica&#146;, his compositions, like much Victorian music, made no impact on the twentieth century. His best work is perhaps to be found in his songs: he wrote to the music critic Joseph Bennett (23 February 1887) that he hoped he had earned &#145;a place as a representative composer of this kind of music&#146;  (U. Edin. L., MS Dk.7.38<sup>5</sup>). Other pieces loyally marked occasions such as the duke of Edinburgh's marriage (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Festal March</span>, Liverpool festival, 1874) and Queen Victoria's golden jubilee (<span class="italic">A Jubilee Lyric</span>, Cheltenham festival, 1887). After retiring he devoted his energies particularly to writing anthems, such as <span class="italic">The Glory of Lebanon</span> for the 800th anniversary of Winchester Cathedral (1893). Among his prized possessions was the autograph of Bach's prelude and fugue BWV 544 for organ.<br>
