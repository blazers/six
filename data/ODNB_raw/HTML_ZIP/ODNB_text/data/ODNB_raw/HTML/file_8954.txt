<span class="headword">Evans,  Edward</span>  (1789&#150;1835), <span class="occ">printseller</span>, was probably born in London. He was the founder of a noted London print dealership which was eventually inherited by his two sons. Almost nothing is known of Evans's early life except that he trained as a compositor at the printers Nichols &amp; Son in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street. His <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary records that the firm of Nichols &amp; Son quickly elevated him to the more senior position of reader on account of his efficiency and speed. Despite this advancement, Evans was obviously a man of determination. Having saved a small capital sum he decided to set himself up in business as a printseller with a specialist interest in engraved historic portrait heads. Although published without a date, Evans's <span class="italic">Catalogue of a Collection of Engraved Portraits</span> indicates the extensive stock of upwards of 20,000 English and foreign portrait prints that was available at his Great Queen Street shop. Evans was particularly well suited to this trade. First he was remembered for his &#145;cleverness and industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1860, 434) in arranging his complicated stock into a taxonomy which met the needs of his customers and, second, as an &#145;amiable, good-tempered man&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1835, 105), he was able to develop close relationships with a number of collectors and literary men. For example, the antiquarian Mark Noble frequently consulted him on matters of biographical research and, in return, Evans supplied him with detailed accounts of the information inscribed on various prints.<br>
<br>The enterprise prospered, and following Edward Evans's death, at Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 24 November 1835, his wife, Anne, continued the business with their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_8954"></a><span class="headword">Edward David Evans</span>  (1818&#150;1860)<span class="occ"></span>. He too attained a reputation for his knowledge of rare portrait prints. Edward David Evans died on 15 August 1860, at the age of only forty-two, at his home, 3 Circus Road, St John's Wood. He was survived by his wife and four children, and the business continued trading, as A. E. Evans &amp; Son, under the guidance of his brother Albert Evans, from new premises at 403 Strand.<br>
