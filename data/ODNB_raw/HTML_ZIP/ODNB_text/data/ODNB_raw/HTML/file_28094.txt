<span class="headword">Leemput,  Remigius <span class="st"> [Remy]</span>  van</span>  (1607&#150;1675), <span class="occ">painter and art collector</span>, was of Flemish or possibly French origin and was baptized at Antwerp in December 1607. He was received into the guild of St Luke in Antwerp in 1628&#150;9. By October 1635 he had settled in England and was living in Covent Garden, London. Van Leemput is listed in various contemporary inventories as Remee, Remy, and Old Remy. He was associated with the studio of Sir Anthony Van Dyck and established a reputation as a copyist. Series of small copies of Van Dyck's portraits, known as &#145;closet&#146; pictures, were much in demand in the seventeenth century. They exist at Weston Park, Hampshire; Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire (of the children of the fourth earl of Bedford); and in the Royal Collection. The latter two groups were both previously attributed to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24296/', "Theodore Russell (bap. 1614, d. 1689)")</script>, with whose works van Leemput's have been confused, but have subsequently been convincingly re-attributed to van Leemput (although several hands may have been at work in the Woburn series). A particularly fine example from the Woburn series, attributed to van Leemput, is the small portrait of Anne, Lady Digby, painted <i>c</i>.1641. The Royal Collection series, which includes copies after Sir Peter Lely and Samuel Cooper, as well as Van Dyck, was recorded in the reign of Queen Anne as by van Leemput and located in her bathing room. By the reign of George III they were associated with Russell but the traditional attribution to van Leemput is more convincing. Van Leemput was also paid &pound;150 by Charles II for a life-size copy after Holbein's mural <span class="italic">Henry VII, Elizabeth of York, Henry VIII and Jane Seymour</span> (1537), originally commissioned by Henry VIII for Whitehall Palace. The Holbein wall painting was destroyed by the Whitehall fire of 1698 and van Leemput's copy of it and another one he executed (the latter now at Petworth House, Sussex) are the only records of the original full composition. Van Leemput also painted individual independent works such as the <span class="italic">Portrait of an Unknown Officer and Servants</span> at Lennoxlove, East Lothian.<br>
<br>As well as painting van Leemput was a collector and dealer, a leading figure in the London art world and he purchased a number of important works at the sale of Charles I's collections, including Van Dyck's famous <span class="italic">Charles I with M. de S Antoine</span> of 1633 (Royal Collection). Van Leemput attempted to sell the portrait in Antwerp but failed to find a buyer and the work was eventually reclaimed from him by the crown at the Restoration. The painting was widely copied and some of the smaller versions, such as that in the Museo del Prado, Madrid, have been attributed to van Leemput. A copy of one of Van Dyck's portraits of Queen Henrietta Maria, attributed to van Leemput, is in Dulwich Picture Gallery, London, described in the actor William Cartwright's original inventory as &#145;coped by oul Reme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mr Cartwright's Pictures</span>, 34). His quirky, distinctive style is unmistakable in such works.<br>
<br>Van Leemput died in 1675 and was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 9 November, where his son Charles had been laid to rest on 19 September 1651. Another son, Giovanni Remigio, made a reputation for himself as a copyist in Italy and his daughter Mary also showed a talent for painting. She married Thomas Streeter, nephew of the serjeant-painter Robert Streeter. To his wife Anna Maria, van Leemput left all his estate including &#145;my house at Antwerpe upon the Meere and two small parcells of Land being near the said city of Antwerpe&#146;  (will). Van Leemput's considerable collection of works of art was sold at Somerset House on 14 May 1677.<br>
