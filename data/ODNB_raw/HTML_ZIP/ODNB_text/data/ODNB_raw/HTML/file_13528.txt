<span class="headword">Holland,  James</span>  (1799&#150;1870), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 17 October 1799 in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, the illegitimate son of Martha Holland (1777&#150;1847). His father is believed to have been Timothy Edge (1776&#150;1838), whom Martha Holland married in 1800, and who was employed in the Holland family pottery at Hill Top in Burslem. At the age of twelve James was taken on by John Davenport at Longport Hall as an apprentice pottery and porcelain painter, where he developed his skill in flower and bird painting. His apprenticeship was completed in the spring of 1819 and he decided to seek a career as an artist in London, while supporting himself through continued pottery painting. He found employment at one of the works in Deptford, which was at that time well outside London itself, and on 24 January 1820 he married a local girl, Elizabeth Mary Evans, at St Paul's parish church. By 1823 his circumstances had improved sufficiently to enable him to give up pottery painting, and to move to Marylebone, which was much closer to central London. A year later he moved again, this time to the St Pancras area of the city where, apart from an extended period in Greenwich, he was to spend the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Holland's first exhibition success came in 1824 when he had a flower painting accepted by the Royal Academy and thereafter he became a regular exhibitor both there and at the exhibitions of the Society of British Artists and the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Although his marriage was only brief&#151;his wife died in 1828&#151;they had three sons and two daughters; only the daughters survived into adulthood. In 1831 he travelled abroad for the first time, to Paris with fellow artist John Scarlett Davis, and in 1835 made the first of many trips to Venice, a city that he painted extensively, especially in watercolour. This work largely established his reputation. That same year, he was elected to the Society of Painters in Water Colours. About this time he met Charlotte Martha Morrant (1817&#150;1909), with whom he had a relationship for the rest of his life, fathering a son who died in infancy and two daughters both of whom survived him. In 1837 he was commissioned by the <span class="italic">Landscape Annual</span> to travel to Portugal and produce illustrations for their forthcoming traveller's guide to that country. Many other overseas painting trips took him as far afield as Egypt, in addition to which he travelled and painted extensively throughout mainland Britain.<br>
<br>In 1842 Holland resigned from the Society of Painters in Water Colours to concentrate his efforts on gaining election to the Royal Academy which, curiously, he never achieved; he rejoined the society in 1856. His last continental painting trip was again to Venice in 1865 and thereafter he mainly worked only from his studio. He last had works accepted for exhibition at the society's winter exhibition in Pall Mall, London, in February 1870. He died on 13 February 1870 in his house, 8 Osnaburgh Street, St Pancras, of cirrhosis of the liver and exhaustion, and was buried in the family grave at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. Well over two hundred of his works were exhibited during his lifetime, and several hundred were still in his studio when he died. Although best known as a watercolourist, he was equally talented in oils and is generally regarded as one of the finest artists of the English school, both a contemporary and an equal of the likes of R. P. Bonington and W. H. Hunt. His works can be found in most of the major collections in Great Britain, and many abroad, with particularly fine examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the City Art Gallery and Museum, Stoke-on-Trent; and the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.<br>
