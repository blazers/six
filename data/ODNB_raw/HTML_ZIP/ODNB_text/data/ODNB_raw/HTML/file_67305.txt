<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Crowe, Dame  Sylvia</span>  (1901&#150;1997), <span class="occ">landscape architect</span>, was born on 15 September 1901 at 30 Oxford Road, Neithrop, Banbury, Oxfordshire, the daughter of Eyre Crowe, a box and cabinet manufacturer who, because of ill health, retired early to become a fruit farmer near the village of Felbridge, Sussex, and his wife, Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stockton. Crowe's own childhood was also marred by ill health, for after attending Berkhamsted Girls' School in Hertfordshire from 1908 to 1912 she had to stay at home receiving only spasmodic lessons as a result of her suffering from tuberculosis. None the less her memories of childhood were happy. Her parents were devoted to the countryside, their farm was in a delightful part of England beside the shores of a lake, and they often travelled in France and Corsica, where she remembered her &#145;fourth birthday in a Corsican forest sitting revelling in the carpet of wild cyclamen&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 31). While kept away from school in her teens she helped on her father's farm and wandered in the landscape. In her early twenties she spent several years in the beautiful countryside of Italy with her parents. She attended Swanley Horticultural College (1920&#150;22), became a pupil of the landscape gardener Edward White (1926&#150;7) and then worked as a garden designer for William Cutbush &amp; Son's nurseries in Barnet. The sensitivity of her garden designs was recognized when she won a gold medal at the Chelsea flower show in 1937 for a contoured bluebell wood from which a stream flowed into a naturalistic pond. During the Second World War she served first with the Polish army in France as a volunteer ambulance driver, and then in motor transport, becoming a sergeant in the ATS. In later life she always liked to be driven by others.<br>
<br>After 1945 Crowe entered private practice as a landscape architect, sharing an office, but never as partner, with Brenda Colvin, whose ideas she was soon to put into practice with startling effectiveness and perception. In 1956 she wrote: &#145;I gratefully acknowledge my debt to all who have contributed to the present school of thought on landscape, and in particular to Brenda Colvin &hellip; and to G. A. Jellicoe&#146;  (Crowe, foreword). Crowe was the great achiever of the landscape profession in the second half of the twentieth century. Her humanity, her common touch, and her charm, combined with vigour and clarity of purpose, enabled her to persuade her numerous clients to put her ideas about landscape into practice. She wrote:<blockquote>The object of my work and writing is to reconcile the needs and aspirations of men with the welfare of the natural order and to create beauty out of the fusion of the human spirit and the workings of nature. I try to enter into the spirit of each landscape and to express its individual character. (Emanuel, 180)</blockquote>She worked in Great Britain (except for once in India and a plan for the Commonwealth Gardens in Canberra, Australia), from a small office at 182 Gloucester Place, London, assisted by Wendy Powell and a few others. The 1950s to 1970s, when she was at her most productive, were a period when minimalism was important in artistic thought. Many of her works were reticent in displaying her own artistic endeavour, so that her designs for huge modifications of the landscape for human purposes have been perceived as part of the natural order of things. Many of her works were indeed great in scale. One of her first tasks after the Second World War was to work on the reclamation of sand dunes in Lincolnshire damaged by wartime gun emplacements and so by eroding.<br>
<br>In 1948 Crowe became consultant on landscape design at Harlow New Town, where she made real the green spaces on Sir Frederick Gibberd's master plan. This work led to work in other new towns, including Basildon in Essex, Washington in co. Durham, and Warrington in Lancashire. She was the landscape consultant for nuclear power stations at Trawsfynydd, in Snowdonia, where she had refused to support the principle of a power station in a national park, and at Wylfa head, Anglesey. In both these projects her interest in creating artificial hills helped to mask smaller elements and create a large-scale setting for the huge generators. She designed and saw completed numerous landscapes adjacent to buildings, university courtyards in Oxford, hospital grounds, churchyards, and training colleges. Her gardens at the Cement and Concrete Association Research Station at Wexham Springs in Buckinghamshire, the Scottish Widows' Fund offices in Edinburgh, and the Commonwealth Institute in London, were particularly well known. She also greatly enjoyed designing landscapes for reservoirs, including Bewl Bridge and Bough Beech in Kent and Wimbleball in Somerset: &#145;it is very largely the recreational side I have to worry about, because the water is there anyway&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 51). A masterpiece was her design for Rutland water, a project to which she was personally attached. The landscape was planned around this beautiful lake to benefit engineering, wildlife, visitors, and nearby residents in equal measure in a new place of serenity and harmony, &#145;created with the three great landscape elements of landform, trees and water&#146;  (Crowe, 63).<br>
<br>Crowe's greatest achievement was her work as the first landscape consultant to the Forestry Commission from 1964 to 1976. &#145;One had to use discretion and diplomacy in the early days until gradually good landscape became accepted within the Commission &hellip; I believe that planting should be made to talk the same language as the terrain&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 44&#150;5). She completely changed the ethos of the commission from a narrow specialism to a body able to balance the needs of timber production with wildlife, recreation, and beauty of landscape. Her ideas, communicated with an infectious smile and lucid exposition, came to be embraced by all from foresters in the field to senior civil servants. Her slim and influential book <span class="italic">Forestry in the Landscape</span> (1966) expounded her ideas on this subject. It was one of many books, including <span class="italic">Tomorrow's Landscape</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Garden Design</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Landscape of Power</span> (1958), <span class="italic">The Landscape of Roads</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Space for Living</span>, which she edited (1961), <span class="italic">Shaping Tomorrow's Landscape</span>, which she co-wrote with Zvi Miller (1964), <span class="italic">The Landscapes of Forests and Woods</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">The Pattern of Landscape</span> (1988).<br>
<br>Crowe was founding honorary secretary (1948), vice-president and secretary-general (1953&#150;9), and president (1969) of the International Federation of Landscape Architects, president of her professional body, the Institute of Landscape Architects, later the Landscape Institute (1957&#150;9), chairman of the Tree Council (1974&#150;6), and a founder member of the environmental planning committee of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. She received honorary doctorates from the University of Newcastle (1976), Herriot-Watt University (1976), and the University of Sussex (1978), honorary fellowships of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Institute of Chartered Foresters, and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, and the special honours of the president's medal of the American Society of Landscape Architects (1988), the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society (1990), and the gold medal of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (1990). She was created CBE in 1967 and DBE in 1973, the first landscape architect to be so highly honoured since Sir Joseph Paxton 122 years earlier. She lived for more than fifty years in a small basement flat in Ladbroke Grove, London, fading slowly but gracefully until her death from bronchopneumonia at St Mary's Hospital, Westminster, on 30 June 1997. She never married. Her beautiful features and earthy laugh expressed contentment with life: &#145;I have enjoyed being a landscape architect; I would not have wanted to be anything else&#146;  (Harvey, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 51).<br>
