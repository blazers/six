<span class="headword">Knapp,  John Leonard</span>  (1767&#150;1845), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 9 May 1767 at Shenley, Buckinghamshire, the youngest son of the Revd Primatt Knapp, rector of Shenley, and Keturah, third daughter of Nathaniel French of Antigua. After attending school at Thame in Oxfordshire he went at an early age into the navy. He was present at an engagement with John Paul Jones (1747&#150;1792) the pirate, and sailed under Captain Philip Carteret (<i>d</i>. 1796), but ill health caused him to leave the navy while he was still young. He had joined the Herefordshire militia by September 1792 (when he became a lieutenant) and was present with that regiment during the riots at Bristol Bridge in September 1793. In 1795 he became a captain in the Northamptonshire militia, but resigned later that year. Until about 1805 he lived mainly at Powick, near Worcester.<br>
<br>From an early age Knapp took an interest in natural history. Later, for a number of years he took long summer botanical excursions. On one of these he visited Scotland with George Don and collected several of the rarest species of British grasses. He published <span class="italic">The Gramina Britannica</span> in 1804 using many of the specimens from his botanical tour of Scotland; it contained 119 coloured plates of grasses drawn by Knapp. Unfortunately a fire at the printing works of T. Bensley at Bolt Court destroyed all of the impressions except for a hundred copies that were with the binder. It was reprinted by Mr Strong of Bristol in 1842 with little alteration of the original text and no addition of species.<br>
<br>In October 1804 at Walcot, Bath, Knapp married Lydia Frances (1772/3&#150;1838), youngest daughter of Arthur Freeman, a plantation owner in Antigua. They had seven children, of whom three lived to survive Knapp. In 1805 he went to live at Llan-ffwyst, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, and from there during the spring of 1813 he made his last move, to Alveston near Bristol, Gloucestershire, where he owned some farmland.<br>
<br>In 1818 Knapp published anonymously a poem, <span class="italic">Arthur, or, The Pastor of the Village</span>, also printed by Bensley. Between 1820 and 1830 he wrote a series of articles for the <span class="italic">Time's Telescope</span> under the title of &#145;The naturalist's diary&#146;. These formed the germ of his most successful work, also anonymous, <span class="italic">The Journal of a Naturalist</span> (1829), which reached a fourth edition. The book is an account of the natural history, country life, and agriculture along the escarpment from Alveston to Thornbury in Gloucestershire and was inspired by Gilbert White's <span class="italic">Natural History of Selborne</span> (1789).<br>
<br>Knapp's last years were spent at Alveston where he was a churchwarden. His time was now spent almost entirely in the pursuit of natural history and the cultivation of his garden, even up to the day before his death, at his home, Old Alveston House, on 29 April 1845. He was buried six days later at the old St Helen's Church, Ridgeway, Alveston (now disused). Knapp was a fellow of the Linnean Society (from 1796) and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was elected an honorary member of the Bristol Philosophical and Literary Society in 1824. J. W. White described Knapp as &#145;a charming botanist and traveller through the inexhaustible regions of nature&#146;  (White, 85). The genus of grasses previously named <i>Milbora</i> by Adanson was called <i>Knappia</i> by Smith.<br>
