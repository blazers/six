<span class="headword">Wadsworth,  Thomas</span>  (1630&#150;1676), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and religious writer</span>, was born in the parish of St Saviour's, Southwark, on 15 December 1630, the son of Thomas Wadsworth, who was a friend of Samuel Bolton, master of Christ's College, Cambridge, and lecturer at St Saviour's. Wadsworth attended school in Southwark, where he was taught by a Mr Woodward. On 22 June 1647 he was admitted as a pensioner to Christ's College, Cambridge, with a Mr Harrison and then William Owtram as his tutor. He graduated BA in 1651 and proceeded MA in 1654. He was elected a fellow of Christ's before Christmas 1652, but resigned his fellowship to take up the position of minister to St Mary's parish, Newington Butts, Surrey, to which he was appointed on 16 February 1653. He was ordained by the eighth London classis in the church of St Mary Axe.<br>
<br>Young and inexperienced, Wadsworth wrote to Richard Baxter asking for his advice. Baxter later wrote that he &#145;had long much communication by Letters&#146; with Wadsworth &#145;before I ever saw his face&#146;  (Baxter, foreword, sig. A4). Wadsworth organized his ministry along lines suggested by Baxter: &#145;with prayers and tears, not only publickly, but from one house to another, I have beseeched you to be reconciled unto God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exhortation</span>, sig. A3). According to Baxter, to Wadsworth's:<blockquote>constant Publick Preaching he added this work of <i>Personal</i> and Family Instruction; not only to visit the sick, but to teach and Exhort his Flock in health, to prepare for death, <i>and work out their Salvation</i>, To Catechize them, and help them understand the words, and to get down the sweetness and power of the matter upon their hearts. (Baxter, foreword, sig. A7<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Wadsworth even &#145;hired another to help in that work; gave <span class="roman">Bibles</span> to the poor People of his Parish, and expended &hellip; his Estate on these Works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.95).<br>
<br>Wadsworth published several expanded sermons and treatises, beginning in 1660 with <span class="italic">A Serious Exhortation to an Holy Life</span>. The same year, however, on 29 September, he was forced to resign the living at St Mary's in favour of James Meggs, who had been sequestered by parliament on 20 June 1643, although he did retain a Saturday morning lectureship at St Antholin's, as well as a Monday evening lectureship at St Margaret's, New Fish Street Hill. On 29 January 1662 he was chosen by the parishioners of St Laurence Pountney in London to fill the perpetual curacy that was in their patronage, but was ejected when the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> came into effect on 24 August 1662. Wadsworth's first wife, whose name is unknown but who was a younger daughter of Henry Hastings from Newington Butts, died during childbirth on 13 October 1661. In November 1663 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of Henry Gibs from Bristol, and widow of Thomas Sharp, a London merchant. Margaret had a son named Thomas from her previous marriage, but she and Wadsworth had no surviving children.<br>
<br>&#145;His health calling him to abide most in the Country&#146;, Wadsworth moved to Theobalds in the parish of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, where he preached privately to a congregation of dissenters  (Baxter, foreword, sig. B4). At the request of members of his former parish in Southwark he also quietly gathered a congregation there which met in Globe Alley. Wadsworth divided his time between these two congregations, but took no salary from either, living instead off his own income. He owned lands and properties in Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire, and Pickle Herring Stairs, Globe Alley, and Deadman's Place, all in Southwark. He was also active in raising money to support the families of ejected ministers.<br>
<br>During the plague of 1665 Wadsworth continued to minister in the London area, and after the fire of 1666 a timber meeting-house was built for his congregation in Deadman's Place. He resumed publishing with <span class="italic">The Immortality of the Soul</span> and <span class="italic">Faith's Triumphs over the Fear of Death</span>, both in 1670, and <span class="italic">Separation yet No Schism</span> (1675). His wife Margaret died on 3 January 1668, and in 1671 he married Anna, daughter of Colonel Markham; they had two sons, Thomas and Nathaniel, and two daughters, Anna and Hester. After Charles II's indulgence of 1672, Wadsworth was licensed on 1 May 1672 to be &#145;a Presbyterian Teacher&#146; in Jonathan Pritman's house in Theobalds, which was also licensed as a &#145;Presbyterian Meeting-place&#146;  (Urwick, 509).<br>
<br>Several weeks before his death Wadsworth moved from Theobalds back to his house at Pickle Herring Stairs in Southwark. He had suffered for some time from kidney and bladder stones, and was in poor health and constant pain. He died on 29 October 1676 and was buried at St Olave's, Southwark, on 6 November; his wife, Anna, survived him. His funeral sermon was preached by his Theobalds assistant, Robert Bragge, and published as <span class="italic">The Life and Death of the Godly Man</span> (1676). Several of Wadsworth's works were published posthumously including <span class="italic">Mr. Thomas Wadsworth's Last Warning to Secure Sinners</span> (1677), <span class="italic">Wadsworth's Remains</span> (1680), and <span class="italic">A Serious Exhortation unto Self-Examination</span> (1687).<br>
