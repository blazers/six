<span class="headword">Cassels,  Walter Richard</span>  (1826&#150;1907), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, fourth son of Robert Cassels, for many years British consul at Honfleur, and his wife, Jean, daughter of John Scougall of Leith, was born in London on 4 September 1826. The family, which liked to trace its pedigree to Alfred the Great, was of mercantile capacity.<br>
<br>Walter, who early showed literary ability, with two volumes of poetry published (1850, 1856), became partner with his brothers Andrew and John in the firm of Peel, Cassels &amp; Co. at Bombay. That position he held until 1865, publishing <span class="italic">Cotton: an Account of its Culture in the Bombay Presidency</span> (1862). From 1863 to 1865 he was an active member of the legislative council of Bombay. Referring to a debate in the council on 8 September 1864, the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazette</span> distinguished Sir William Rose Mansfield and Cassels as &#145;men known not only throughout India but in England for the knowledge and ability they have shown in discussing the most important questions of commercial law and practice&#146;. Returning to England, Cassels lived in London, save for an interval spent in the neighbourhood of Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1874 Cassels published anonymously two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Supernatural Religion: an Inquiry into the Reality of Divine Revelation</span>, in which he impugned the credibility of miracles and the authenticity of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. This publication, which was calculated to provoke antagonism, was a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>. The wildest conjectures as to its author were rife; it was attributed among others to a nephew of E. B. Pusey, and to Connop Thirlwall. Joseph Barber Lightfoot, moved by what he deemed its &#145;cruel and unjustifiable assault &hellip; on a very dear friend&#146;, began in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> a series of nine articles entitled &#145;Supernatural religion&#146;, which appeared at intervals up to May 1877; though left unfinished, these articles materially reduced the anonymous writer's pretensions to scholarship, and were regarded as giving new strength to the defence of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> canon; they were collected into a volume of <span class="italic">Essays</span> in 1889.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Cassels's book passed through six editions by 1875; in 1877 a third volume was added; a revised edition of the complete work appeared in 1879; popular editions in one volume, after compression and further revision, were issued in 1902 and 1905. To Lightfoot's first essay the author had replied anonymously in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (January 1875); this and other rejoinders he collected in <span class="italic">A Reply to Dr Lightfoot's Essays by the Author of &#145;Supernatural Religion&#146;</span> (1889). Lightfoot reverted to the controversy in a paper in the <span class="italic">Academy</span>, the last he wrote (21 September 1889), to which Cassels replied anonymously in the <span class="italic">Academy</span> (28 September). In 1894 appeared <span class="italic">The Gospel According to Peter: a Study by the Author of &#145;Supernatural Religion&#146;</span>. The secret of this authorship was marvellously well kept: Lightfoot wrote in 1889 that he knew neither his name nor &#145;whether he is living or dead&#146;. On the appearance in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (April 1895) of an article, &#145;The Diatessaron of Tatian&#146;, signed Walter R. Cassels, the statement was made in the <span class="italic">Manchester City News</span> (20 April 1895) that Cassels (described as &#145;a Manchester poet&#146;) &#145;has now avowed himself the author of &#145;Supernatural religion&#146;&#146;. There was no public avowal. Further articles appeared in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> entitled &#145;The virgin birth of Jesus&#146; (January 1903) and &#145;The present position of apologetics&#146; (October 1903) and signed Walter R. Cassels, yet the public was slow to connect them with the author of <span class="italic">Supernatural Religion</span>.<br>
<br>Cassels was long a collector of pictures. Five were sold at Christies on 30 June 1906; they had cost him &pound;1685 5<i>s</i>., and they realized &pound;8547. Among them was Turner's <span class="italic">Rape of Europa</span>, which he had bought in 1871 for 295 guineas and which sold for 6400 guineas, and the portrait of John Wesley by Romney. Cassels died, unmarried, at his house, 43 Harrington Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 10 June 1907.<br>
