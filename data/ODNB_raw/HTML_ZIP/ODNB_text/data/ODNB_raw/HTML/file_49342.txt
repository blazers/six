<span class="headword">Walker,  Thomas Andrew</span>  (1828&#150;1889), <span class="occ">civil engineering contractor</span>, was born on 15 October 1828 at Kerrymore, Brewood, Staffordshire, the first of three children of Robert Walker, land agent of Brewood, and Ann Hay. In 1845, after a brief course in applied science at King's College, London, he began his professional career by undertaking work on parliamentary surveys. Walker became one of the most important civil engineering contractors of the nineteenth century, demonstrating exceptional management abilities in undertaking some of the largest contracts of his day. In 1847 he was employed by Thomas Brassey on the North Staffordshire Railway and remained with him until 1854 working on the Royston and Hitchin, and Newcastle and Ashbourne, railways, and for the last two years on the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. On 6 January 1852 Walker married Fanny Beetlestone; they had four surviving daughters. In 1854 he began his own contracting career in Canada, building railways for the government of the Lower Provinces for a further seven years.<br>
<br>Walker returned to England in 1861. Then, as assistant to P. Pritchard Baly, in 1863 he made a survey for the Oryol and Vitebsk Railway in Russia. During 1864&#150;5 he made extensive railway surveys for Charles Manby in Egypt and the Sudan. He returned to England in 1865 and managed the contracts for the Metropolitan Railway extension and the construction of the Metropolitan District line. He undertook these works, from Edgware Road to the Mansion House, jointly with Peto and Betts, Kelk, and Waring Brothers, completing the work by 1 July 1871. From this date to his death he was engaged, at first in partnership with his brother Charles and then alone, in a series of contracts for some of the largest engineering projects of the late nineteenth century. He undertook the extension of the East London Railway from the north end of the Thames Tunnel to its junction with the Great Eastern line at Shoreditch. This work involved tunnelling under the London docks and was completed in 1876. The engineer for the East London line, Sir John Hawkshaw, was so impressed with Walker's work that he entrusted him with the construction of the Severn railway tunnel, designed to shorten the Great Western route from Bristol to south Wales. Work had begun on the tunnel in 1873, but, after slow progress, was handed over to Sir John Hawkshaw as chief engineer and Thomas Walker as contractor on 18 December 1879. Characteristically, Walker employed a great deal of steam-powered machinery on this job. The work was one of great difficulty owing to the irruption of water, but was completed in 1889, when the tunnel was opened to goods traffic. Walker spoke of the &#145;ever-varying and strangely contorted strata, and the dangers from flood above and flood below&#146; and said &#145;one sub-aqueous tunnel is quite enough for a lifetime&#146;  (Walker, preface). During the tunnel works he was also engaged on the Deal and Dover Railway (1880); the Elham Valley Railway (Canterbury&#150;Folkestone, 1889); completion of the Prince of Wales Dock, Swansea (1881); extension of Penarth Dock (1884); Barry Dock (1889), and part of the Barry railway; and completion of the Lisvane Reservoir for Cardiff corporation (1886).<br>
<br>Walker's last undertaking was his greatest work. In June 1887 he obtained the contract for the whole works of the Manchester Ship Canal, at &pound;5.75 million. As soon as he had possession of the land the chief engineer said that Walker &#145;showed great energy in commencing to erect huts, hospitals, and chapels for the workmen&#146;  (Williams, 419). Walker was renowned for the care and provisions made for his army of navvies. He established the administrative structure and amassed the largest group of steam-powered contractor's plant assembled for one contract up to that time. This included locomotives, waggons, cranes, and excavating machinery, and the first &#145;steam navvy&#146; was at work in December 1887. Unfortunately within two years of starting work Walker died, and the ship canal company took over the work and the construction plant, valued at over &pound;860,000. Walker died, of Bright's disease, at his home, Mount Balan, in Caer-went, Monmouthshire, on 25 November 1889. He was buried at St Stephen's Church, Caer-went. Walker's success as a contracting engineer is indicated by the fact that his estate was valued at nearly &pound;1 million.<br>
