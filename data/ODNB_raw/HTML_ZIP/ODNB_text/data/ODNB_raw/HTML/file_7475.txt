<span class="headword">Dene,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1317&#150;1354), <span class="occ">supposed chronicler</span>, may have been the author of BL, Cotton MS Faustina B.v, which comprises the <span class="italic">Registrum Roffense</span>, the author of which declares himself to be a public notary  (BL, Cotton MS Faustina B.v, fol. 12<i>v</i>), and the <span class="italic">Historia Roffensis</span>. The former contains a detailed account of the disputed election of Hamo Hythe (<i>d</i>. in or after 1357) as bishop of Rochester. William Dene, a public notary, was one of those sent by the bishop-elect to cardinals Gaucelin and Luca at Durham in August 1317 with a papal commission to confirm his election. When the cardinals then remitted the case to the papal curia, Hythe sent William Dene and Dr Michael Berham as his proctors to prosecute his claim there. At Avignon Dene was physically threatened by Jean de Jargeau, the proctor of Queen Isabella, who was supporting another candidate. Back in England, after his election had been confirmed, Hythe handed the papal bulls confirming his election to Dene on 29 November 1319; and Dene was present when Hythe made his profession to Walter Reynolds, archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1327), and when he performed homage to the king at York in early December 1319. Dene's name occurs in the long series of documents arising out of the dispute between Hythe and Walter Reynolds over sums due to Hythe from the long vacancy of the latter's see; but so does that of another public notary, Gilbert Sedgeford, who has therefore also been considered a possible author of the manuscript. John Joscelyn (<i>d</i>. 1603) did not differentiate between the <span class="italic">Registrum</span> and the <span class="italic">Historia</span> when asserting that William Dene was the author of the manuscript.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Historia Roffensis</span> provides a chronological narrative moving between information of local interest and national importance from 1320 to 1350. Part of it was printed by Henry Wharton, <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> (1691), while folios 34<i>v</i> to 36<i>v</i>, describing the events of the Westminster parliament of 1321, have been published in <span class="italic">Parliamentary Texts of the Later Middle Ages</span> (ed. N. Pronay and J. Taylor, 1980). Other passages provide insight into the diplomatic activity resulting from the War of St Sardos. The revolution that led to Edward II's deposition, the deposition itself, and the coronation of Edward III are well covered. The chronicle is one of the richest sources for the career of the little-known Archbishop Simon Mepham (<i>d</i>. 1333), about whom Dene is critical, probably reflecting Bishop Hamo's attitude. Despite Hythe's reluctance to attend parliaments in the 1330s, the chronicle provides valuable information about Edward III's wars in Scotland from Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill to Nevilles Cross. Concern that Scottish campaigns were making the realm vulnerable to French attack is at times discernible. Events leading to the Hundred Years' War and the burden of taxation that the war brought with it are detailed, as are major military and naval events: Sluys; the siege of Tournai (about which the chronicler incorporates an extensive news bulletin); Cr&eacute;cy; and the siege of Calais. Other lengthy insertions include evidence pertaining to the bishop of Rochester's claim to jurisdiction over the church of Isleham in the diocese of Norwich; a sympathetic account of the assumption of power in Rome by Rienzi, whose death in 1354 is the last securely dated event to be referred to; and legislation consequent upon the black death.<br>
<br>Like the <span class="italic">Registrum</span>, the <span class="italic">Historia</span> was almost certainly written by someone who was in the entourage of Hamo Hythe while he was bishop of Rochester between 1319 and 1352, and who was alive in 1354. It is possible therefore that the William Dene who was provided to the archdeaconry of Rochester at the bishop's request in September 1323, and who resigned that office in June 1359, was the author. However, in Bishop Hamo's register, this William Dene is described as <i>magister</i> when instituted to the church of Maplescombe, Kent, in September 1321, whereas the William Dene in the <span class="italic">Registrum Roffense</span> is never so described.<br>
