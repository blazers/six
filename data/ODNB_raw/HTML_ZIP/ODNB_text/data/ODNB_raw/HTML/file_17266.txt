<span class="headword">Lynford,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1724), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at St Benedict's, Cambridge, on 30 October 1650, the son of Samuel Lynford (1609&#150;1657?), prebend of Exeter. Lynford's father was ejected from his living and died before the Restoration. Lynford was educated under Mr Leeds at Newark and then at Bury St Edmunds grammar school before being admitted sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 16 July 1666. He graduated BA in 1670&#150;71 and proceeded MA in 1674. He was ordained in March 1674 and that year became curate at Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire. The following year he became vicar of Great Ellingham, Norfolk, which he resigned in 1676. Lynford was now a tutor in Cambridge, one of his pupils being Robert Perceval, a nephew of Sir Robert Southwell, whom Lynford took pains to impress as a possible future patron. In July 1675 Lynford was made a fellow of Christ's College, although there appears to have been some initial opposition to his election. He was incorporated at Oxford in July 1676. By 1679 he had made sufficient contacts in London to preach a sermon before the lord mayor. In December 1685 Lynford became rector of St Edmund the King, Lombard Street, in the City of London and consequently resigned his fellowship in 1686. During James II's reign he wrote the <span class="italic">Ninth Note of the Church Examined</span>, which was republished by Bishop Edmund Gibson in <span class="italic">Preservative Against Popery</span> (1738), and published several other anti-popish tracts.<br>
<br>In October 1689 Lynford was created DD during William III's visit to Cambridge. He was licensed on 25 November to marry Elizabeth Dillingham (1666/7&#150;1744?) of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. They had no children. In 1695 he was living in the parish of St Gregory by Paul's. After presentation by the king, in April 1700 Lynford was installed as a prebend of Westminster. The founding charter of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in June 1701 described Lynford as a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. In September 1709 he was collated as archdeacon of Barnstaple. Lynford was an opponent of Francis Atterbury, dean of Westminster and bishop of Rochester, in his attempt to build a new dormitory for Westminster School, which involved him in the resulting cases in chancery and before the House of Lords. Lynford served as subdean of Westminster in 1723. He died on 11 August 1724.<br>
<br>As chaplain to William III, Queen Anne, and George I, Lynford published a few sermons, but evidently had no great opinion of his own literary merit for his will, written in April 1724, instructed his nephew, Dr William Herring, not to publish anything he found after his death &#145;because I am sure nothing deserves it&#146;  (will, fol. 69<i>v</i>). This self-effacement continued with his funeral instructions which ordered burial in St Edmund's, Lombard Street, at midnight &#145;without Sermon, without Escutcheons, without any Bearers but the Common Bearers of the Parish&#146;  (will, fol. 68<i>v</i>). His books were divided among his wife, Christ's College, Sion College, the deans and chapters of Westminster and Exeter, and Herring. Most of his estate was left to his wife, whose will was proved in 1744.<br>
