<span class="headword">Bonny,  Anne</span>  (1698&#150;1782), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was born near Cork in Ireland. Evidence from her descendants suggests that she was the illegitimate daughter of William Cormac, lawyer, and his maidservant. Cormac, who raised his daughter as a boy, found his legal practice so affected by his affair that he decided to go abroad. Taking Anne and the maid with him, he sailed to South Carolina, where he became a successful merchant and purchased a plantation.<br>
<br>Anne grew up to be a fierce-tempered and headstrong young woman. In 1718 she married a penniless sailor called James Bonny; this so upset her father that he turned her out of his house. Bonny and Anne made their way to the island of New Providence in the Bahamas, where they hoped to find employment. There Anne was courted by the pirate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37875/', "John Rackam (d. 1720)")</script>, a bold and reckless character whose colourful clothes had earned him the nickname Calico Jack. Rackam had arrived in the Bahamas in 1719 in order to take advantage of the royal pardon which had been extended to pirates. He persuaded Anne to leave her sailor husband and go to sea with him. When she became pregnant he took her to Cuba, where she gave birth to their child. Soon afterwards he sent for her and she rejoined his crew, dressed as usual in men's clothing. Rackam had resumed his life as a pirate and Anne took part in a series of attacks on shipping in the Caribbean.<br>
<br>Around this time another female sailor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45454/', "Mary Read (c.1695&#150;1721)")</script>, joined Rackam's crew. She too had been brought up as a boy, had spent some years as a soldier in Flanders, and after her husband's death had joined a merchant ship bound for the West Indies. Bonny and Read became close friends and, according to witnesses at their subsequent trial, were the fiercest members of the crew: &#145;they were both very profligate, cursing and swearing much and ready and willing to do any thing on board&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 137/14). On 5 September 1720 Captain Woodes Rogers, the governor of the Bahamas, issued a proclamation, printed in the <span class="italic">Boston Gazette</span>, which announced that Rackam and twelve others, &#145;including two women, by name Anne Fulford alias Bonny, &amp; Mary Read&#146;, had stolen the <i>William</i>, a 12-ton sloop armed with six guns, from Providence roads and had committed several acts of robbery and piracy. Within a few weeks Rackam's ship was intercepted and captured off Negril Point, Jamaica, by a heavily armed privateer commanded by Captain Jonathan Barnet. The pirates were taken ashore and confined in the gaol at Spanish Town.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1720, at an Admiralty court presided over by Sir Nicholas Lawes, governor of Jamaica, Rackam and the ten men in his crew were found guilty of piracy. They were hanged a few days later. Bonny and Read were tried by the same court on 28 November and were also found guilty and condemned to death. However, they revealed that they were both pregnant and were reprieved. Mary Read died in gaol and was buried on 28 April 1721. Evidence provided by the descendants of Anne Bonny suggests that her father managed to secure her release from gaol and bring her back to Charles Town, South Carolina, where she gave birth to Rackam's second child. On 21 December 1721 she married a local man, Joseph Burleigh, and they had eight children. She died in South Carolina, a respectable woman, at the age of eighty-four and was buried on 25 April 1782.<br>
