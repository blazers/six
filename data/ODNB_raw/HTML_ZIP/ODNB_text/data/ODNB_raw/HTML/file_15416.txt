</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kenrick,  William</span>  (1729/30&#150;1779), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was the son of Robert Kenerick, staymaker, of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary (1708/9&#150;1789). A member of a Baptist family, Kenrick attended probably either Philip James's Baptist school or Thomas Squire's Quaker school. Apprenticed in 1745 to Thomas Bennett, a mathematical instrument maker in London, Kenrick abandoned his apprenticeship after three years, in favour of a career in literature.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Kenrick's verse satire, <span class="italic">The Town</span> (1748), was followed by the much more complex but still essentially juvenile <span class="italic">Old Woman's Dunciad</span> (1751). He also issued two equally unmemorable prose satires on his literary contemporaries and a further verse satire, <span class="italic">The Pasquinade</span> (1753), ridiculing John Hill. Never one to limit his options, Kenrick resorted to panegyric in a bid for patronage, with his <span class="italic">Monody to the Memory of &hellip; Frederick Prince of Wales</span> (1751), but neither abuse nor flattery earned him much public recognition.<br>
<br>However, Kenrick's fluent pen quickly found an appreciative welcome in the periodical press. By 1750 he was editing a monthly literary miscellany, <span class="italic">The Kap&eacute;lion</span>, with Francis Stamper. They became embroiled in (or invented) a paper war with Christopher Smart's rival publications, <span class="italic">The Student</span> and <span class="italic">The Midwife</span>. Kenrick was also significantly involved in the production of an opposition newspaper, <span class="italic">Old England</span> (April 1751 &#150; February 1753). His literary and political views came together when he turned to the stage to lampoon Henry Fielding, whose political views had already made him a target for <span class="italic">Old England</span>. The performance was suppressed by the lord mayor of London, but published under the title <span class="italic">Fun: a Parodi-Tragi-Comical Satire</span> (1752).<br>
<br>In February 1753 Kenrick published his most popular work, <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Woman</span>. Resurrecting a late seventeenth-century title to capitalize on the success of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Oeconomy of Human Life</span>, Kenrick's guide to female conduct went through at least five editions in his lifetime and remained popular well into the next century. This uncharacteristic work may have been a purely commercial venture undertaken to support his new family. On 12 March 1752 he had married Mary Edge (<i>b</i>. 1726/7) with whom he had two daughters and three sons. The eldest son, William Shakespeare Kenrick, succeeded his father as editor of the <span class="italic">London Review</span> in 1778.<br>
<br>Between 1753 and 1756 Kenrick ventured abroad, though he returned periodically, as the births of his second and third children testify. He may have studied in the Netherlands, and he certainly mastered French and German during this period. He penned a defence of English foreign affairs, <span class="italic">L'Observateur observ&eacute;, ou, Lettre d'un Hollandois &agrave; un de ses amis</span> (The Hague, 1756), but later complained that his one venture into political writing had proved fruitless.<br>
<br>Perhaps Kenrick's travels inspired him to a more philosophical view, expressed in his <span class="italic">Epistles to Lorenzo</span> (1756; substantially expanded as <span class="italic">Epistles Philosophical and Moral</span>, 1759). The epistles, in blank verse, were initially acclaimed; the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> hailed Kenrick as &#145;a genius whose temperament and disposition more resembled the immortal Author of the &#147;Essay on Man&#148; than any other poet&#146;  (vol. 16, quoted in Brewer, 48). Thus Kenrick was understandably annoyed when his 1759 version met with a far less warm reception. He took the reviewers to task in <span class="italic">A Scrutiny, or, The Criticks Criticis'd</span> (1759), then abandoned longer poems and turned reviewer in revenge. By July 1759 Kenrick was imprisoned in the king's bench. Since he was taken in by the actress Jane Lessingham upon his release in late 1761 or early 1762, it would appear that his wife had died in the interim.<h2>
<a name="Reviewerandtranslator"></a>Reviewer and translator</h2>Armed with a good knowledge of European languages and in need of a steady income, Kenrick replaced Oliver Goldsmith as the chief reviewer for Ralph Griffiths's <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. Soon afterwards he wrote an exceptionally cruel review of Goldsmith's <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe</span> (1759) for which Griffiths forced him to apologize. Kenrick also sent an anonymous letter to the <span class="italic">St James Chronicle</span> in 1767 accusing Goldsmith of plagiarism, a charge Goldsmith successfully refuted. From 1758 to 1766 Kenrick gruellingly subjected almost all foreign-language publications to an &#145;admirable, if frenzied, astuteness&#146;  (Fussell, 43). Kenrick also took over from Robert Lloyd (who was himself imprisoned for debt) as editor of the <span class="italic">St James Magazine</span> from February 1764 until its demise in June.<br>
<br>While in the king's bench and subsequently immersed in foreign literature for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, Kenrick undertook translations to supplement his income. He began with Rousseau's <span class="italic">La nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</span>, published as <span class="italic">Eloisa</span> in 1761, and by 1767 had translated virtually all of the French philosopher's works (fourteen volumes). Kenrick was clearly interested in Rousseau's ideas, but he and his booksellers were also responding to public demand, which they satisfied with translations of the works of Salomon Gessner (<span class="italic">Rural Poems</span>, 1762) and of Voltaire (<span class="italic">Treatise on Religious Toleration</span>, 1764). While translation was standard fare for the denizens of Grub Street, Kenrick was unusually talented: &#145;Never an enthusiast, he was fully aware of weaknesses in Rousseau's position; but he also saw the futility of dogmatic abuse, and his criticism throughout was the most analytical and unbiased of any of the contemporary commentators upon Rousseau&#146;  (Sewell, 62).<br>
<br>These translations represented the zenith of Kenrick's intellectual reputation. As translator, his name clearly had selling power, for in 1771 his name alone adorned the title-page of <span class="italic">Elements of the History of England, from the Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of George II</span>, even though Gilbert Stuart and John Langhorne each contributed a quarter of the translation from the work by Abb&eacute; Millot. Even more significantly, his efforts brought him scholarly acknowledgement when he was created doctor of laws by the faculty of Marischal College, Aberdeen, in February 1772. With John Murdoch he translated <span class="italic">A Natural History of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals</span> (1775) from the French of Buffon and at his death he was editor of a fourteen-volume translation of Voltaire's works (1779&#150;81).<br>
<br>Having regained some semblance of financial security through his employment on the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, Kenrick was able to marry again; on 5 May 1764 he wed Elizabeth Piercy Perrins (<i>bap</i>. 1744). The couple had no children, and Elizabeth died two years later. During this period Kenrick often visited Thomas Worlidge, the painter responsible for the only known portrait of Kenrick. When Worlidge died in the same year as Elizabeth, Kenrick published several elegiac poems and composed the artist's epitaph.<h2>
<a name="Theatricalworksandmoreliteraryfeuds"></a>Theatrical works and more literary feuds</h2>Either distraught from grief or emboldened by an arrangement to edit a ten-volume edition of Shakespeare for 100 guineas per volume, Kenrick forsook the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> for the theatre, presenting a Shakespearian-inspired comedy entitled <span class="italic">Falstaff's Wedding</span> (1766). Kenrick prefaced his play with a typically arrogant and ironically contemptuous remark to the critics:<blockquote>The author foresaw that these mice would necessarily be nibbling; he has therefore, purposely left some rotten holes in the cheese, that the poor little animals may be kept doing; for, considering them as real objects of pity, he would by no means have them starve for want of employment. (p. vi)</blockquote>Although <span class="italic">Falstaff's Wedding</span> played only one night, Garrick permitted Kenrick to stage a second comedy, <span class="italic">The Widow'd Wife</span>, the next season, which ran for nine nights and was translated into German in 1773.<br>
<br>Kenrick's larger ambitions, however, were severely disappointed when George Steevens agreed to compile a Shakespeare edition without payment and Kenrick's lucrative agreement was cancelled. This loss added poignancy to Kenrick's appearance in September 1766 at the Shakespeare jubilee as Shakespeare's ghost. Modest stage successes kept Kenrick solvent through this period, but he returned to periodical publishing in November 1768 with the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Journal</span>, which survived only a fortnight, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Universal Museum</span> and, after 1773, to the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span>. By the end of January 1769 Kenrick was editing <span class="italic">Critical Memoirs of the Time</span> and was a founding editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> that same year. He also published individual poems in literary magazines, many of which were ultimately collected in his <span class="italic">Poems; Ludicrous, Satirical and Moral</span> (1768; with additions, 1770).<br>
<br>During this period Kenrick also sought to engage Samuel Johnson in controversy. In an exceptionally long review, later published separately (1765), Kenrick meticulously catalogued the imperfections in Johnson's edition of Shakespeare, then issued his <span class="italic">Defence of Mr Kenrick's Review</span> (1766) in response to an essay by Johnson's supporter James Barclay. When Kenrick subsequently published his own <span class="italic">New Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1773), with a guide to pronunciation, he drew almost entirely on Johnson's efforts and must have further galled the great lexicographer. Kenrick also composed <span class="italic">An Epistle to James Boswell, Esq.</span> (1768), accusing Johnson of immoral cynicism and offering Rousseau as a moral guide superior to Boswell's admired Pasquale Paoli. In response to these provocations Johnson maintained a stoic silence.<br>
<br>Unable to incite Johnson, Kenrick contemplated a similar assault on William Warburton. In 1769 Kenrick wrote to John Wilkes, with whom he was on good terms, asking for notes on Pope because &#145;The publication of a new edition affords so fine an opportunity of mauling the Bishop of Gloucester, that I would not lose it for the world&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30870, fol. 116<i>r</i>). Wilkes ultimately passed his notes to Joseph Warton, and Warburton was spared Kenrick's ire.<br>
<br>The sole controversy in which Kenrick's arguments prevailed concerned his views on adultery and divorce, originally published anonymously in 1771 to support Richard Grosvenor's lawsuit against his wife for her liaison with the king's brother, Henry, duke of Cumberland. Kenrick is reputed to have received &pound;500 for this slim volume, probably his most lucrative publication, and later expanded his views in <span class="italic">Observations, Civil and Canonical, on the Marriage Contract</span> (1775).<br>
<br>During these years Kenrick also continued to write for the stage, though his relations with the dramatic companies were never easy. His plays were all reasonably entertaining, but his incessant arguments with the patentees meant that his productions rarely came to the boards without much delay and rancour. After the production of <span class="italic">Falstaff's Wedding</span> Kenrick and Garrick disputed the distribution of the final night's proceeds and by 1771 Kenrick was corresponding with George Colman about an opera for Covent Garden, despite having quarrelled with Colman in print a few years earlier. Colman, who had accepted a Kenrick comedy for the 1772&#150;3 season, opted to stage Goldsmith's new play, <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, instead. Kenrick replied with a libel in the <span class="italic">London Packet</span> that insulted not only Goldsmith but also a female friend; for this affront Goldsmith assaulted the publisher and had to donate &pound;50 to charity to avoid prosecution, while Kenrick reportedly played the part of innocent bystander. Kenrick's <span class="italic">Duellist</span> was presented later in 1773, but the first performance was complicated by an argument over Charles Macklin's employment and the play closed, though it too was later translated into German.<br>
<br>Kenrick's most famous, and shameful, controversy arose in 1772, when he published <span class="italic">Love in the Suds</span>, accusing Garrick of a homosexual relationship with the disgraced Isaac Bickerstaff. The pamphlet went through five editions in the year, until Kenrick, fearing imprisonment for libel, finally suppressed the work and issued an apology in November. Kenrick's resentment stemmed from delays in producing his plays, not from any moral qualms, and the tasteless cruelty of the attack ensured his opprobrium and forced him to confine his opinions to the pages of the <span class="italic">London Review</span>.<h2>
<a name="Otherschemes"></a>Other schemes</h2>Having lost the contract to edit Shakespeare, Kenrick instead collected his friend Robert Lloyd's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1774). That same year, unwilling to let his Shakespearian insights languish, Kenrick converted his critical notes into a series of successful lectures on the bard. Although he twice had to move to larger venues to accommodate the crowds, the series faltered after March 1774 and then metamorphosed into a much grander proposal to establish &#145;A Public Academy, for the Investigation of the English Language, and the Illustration of British Literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, 20 Aug 1774).<br>
<br>The school never eventuated, but its intended curriculum formed the basis for Kenrick's final venture, the <span class="italic">London Review of English and Foreign Literature</span>, which first appeared in January 1775 and survived its founding editor by six months. As editor and chief writer, Kenrick finally exercised complete sovereignty over a critical empire. Although the magazine did not uphold its initial promise of illustrative plates and coverage of all new publications, it rivalled the established reviews and became known for its extended critiques and philosophical interests.<br>
<br>Amid all these publishing ventures Kenrick also found time to develop his long-standing fascination with perpetual motion. As early as 1761 Kenrick (with the support of Thomas Bennett, his former master) had sought a patent for a perpetual motion machine, but refused to supply the details requested by the attorney-general. He claimed to have experimented with the design for more than fifteen years before he presented his arguments in two publications and displayed his device at a series of three lectures in 1770&#150;71. Even the physics of his day recognized the impossibility of such an invention, and Kenrick found few subscribers for a proposed stock offering, though he attracted much notoriety and ridicule. He none the less remained undaunted, returning to the attorney-general in May 1779, less than a month before he died, still in search of a patent.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Throughout the final decade of his life, incessant financial demands required Kenrick to pursue an impressive variety of undertakings. He needed to sustain a new family with his third partner, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1818), with whom he had three daughters between 1770 and 1775. The two apparently never wed, though her 1818 obituary refers to her as his &#145;relict&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1818). On 27 June 1776 Kenrick was back at the altar, this time with Frances Gymer. The two had no children, but this may have been just as well since Kenrick spent most of 1777 and half of 1778 in the Fleet prison for debt when a warehouse fire consumed most of an issue of the <span class="italic">London Review</span>. In 1778 Kenrick finally saw the performance of his only opera, <span class="italic">The Lady of the Manor</span>, and at the end of the year he closed his theatrical career with a Christmas farce, <span class="italic">The Spendthrift</span>. By the beginning of 1779 he could no longer sustain the pace and called upon his eldest son to assist him with the <span class="italic">London Review</span>.<br>
<br>The lingering illness that led to his death, on 10 June 1779, aged forty-nine, remains unidentified. His funeral and burial took place on 13 June, in Chelsea Old Church. The church has been substantially altered and no memorial remains. The probate record a year later lists him as &#145;late of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields&#146;. Frances survived him.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>From his early engagement with his literary contemporaries in the 1751 paper war to his 1778 <span class="italic">Observations on Soame Jenyns's &#145;View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion&#146;</span>, Kenrick was rarely without a public enemy. He relished controversy and always sought the last word. If no one would oppose his views, he was not above writing replies to himself, as he did in a theological tract (<span class="italic">The Grand Question Debated</span>, 1751) and its reply. He dismissively described himself as &#145;a pretender to almost all kinds of writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Pasquinade</span>, 20n.), and his career typified the life of a professional writer, working at various times, frequently simultaneously, as periodical reviewer and editor, translator, dramatist, poet, controversialist, and inventor. Kenrick achieved notoriety in several fields, but sullied his reputation through unjustified attacks on more famous contemporaries. His almost boundless energy and broad learning were impressive, but his unwavering arrogance and irascible temper vitiated his accomplishments. As Alexander Chalmers judiciously concluded almost two centuries ago:<blockquote>Dr. Kenrick was really a man of talents, and deficient only in the knowledge of making a proper use of them; it was his misfortune likewise to settle upon no regular plan of study, and to fancy himself equal to any task which his necessities imposed upon him. (Chalmers, 19.324)</blockquote>
