<span class="headword">Fournier,  Robert Charles Privett</span>  (1915&#150;2008), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born on 16 March 1915 at 5 Mount Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, the son of Alphonse Robert William Fournier (1884&#150;1954), a woodworking engineer who helped to build aircraft in the First World War and later motor cars, and his wife, Helen Maude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Privett (1890&#150;1965), who became a Labour alderman. It was a happy childhood. At grammar school Fournier did well in art and also composed poetry, which astonished his teacher who refused to believe he had written it. In Fulham he became a member of an amateur dramatics company where, in addition to acting, he painted the scenery. Keen to live in the country, he moved to Hertfordshire with his then partner, Sylvia, but their plans to settle were thwarted when they bought a piece of land from a con man and lost all their money. For a time he and Sylvia worked as farm labourers, horrifying their neighbours by living together in a shed.<br>
<br>Having refused to enlist following the introduction of conscription in the Second World War, Fournier was arrested and imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs prison, where, as the bombs fell on London, he helped to write and produce the prisoners' magazine. The death of his only brother, Victor, a navigator in the Royal Air Force, in a plane crash over Wales, served to confirm his pacifist beliefs. Intent on pursuing a career in art he modelled animals seen in London Zoo. Enthralled by clay, on his release from prison he attended evening classes at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, coming under the watchful eye of Dora Billington, an outstanding teacher and potter. Far from following the established approach that was based on an aesthetic of quietude advocated by Bernard Leach, she encouraged a more eclectic, challenging view that included Mediterranean and industrial wares. Finding it difficult to afford the fees, Fournier took a job as a technician at the school, becoming Billington's assistant.<br>
<br>In 1946 Fournier set up Ducketts Wood Pottery in Hertfordshire where he produced slipware, tin-glaze, and later mosaics. In 1948 he established the pottery department at Goldsmiths' College, London. There he met Sheila Lord (1930&#150;2000), one of his students, a divorced schoolteacher, and daughter of Robert Cook, railway clerk. They married on 22 July 1961. For a time they had a studio in Greenwich before moving to Castle Hill in Kent in 1965, where they produced tableware as well as making individual pieces. Aware of the growing educational interest in ceramics, Fournier issued 500 colour slides of historical ceramics, then a revolutionary educational aid much used by schools and individual potters. In 1971 they settled in the beautiful village of Lacock in Wiltshire, leasing, on a peppercorn rent, an old workhouse owned by the National Trust, carrying out much needed extensive renovation.<br>
<br>At Lacock Fournier consolidated his ceramics, producing what became his signature pieces, a range of &#145;pebble&#146; pots that were based on natural form. With a sure understanding of the organic structures of stones, rocks, and plants, he translated these into clay through the use of simple, hand-built or moulded dish shapes or tall flattened bottles. These were decorated with areas of unglazed clay and poured textured white glaze, and dotted with small patches of rich, saturated colour. He was particularly renowned for producing a vibrant turquoise blue. The pots were successfully shown at galleries in Britain, Germany, and France.<br>
<br>In addition to potting, Fournier pursued his interest in writing. A book on building electric kilns with clear instructions and much practical advice dispelled the mystique around constructing simple but efficient structures. As an inveterate compiler of information relevant to studio pottery he was assiduous in scouring available technical texts, bringing it together and presenting it in dictionary form. Titles included <span class="italic">The Illustrated Dictionary of Practical Pottery</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Illustrated Dictionary of Pottery Form</span> (1981), and <span class="italic">The Illustrated Dictionary of Pottery Decoration</span> (1986). Later he collaborated with Eric Yates-Owen on <span class="italic">British Studio Potters' Marks</span> (1999), a thoroughly researched and comprehensive survey of the stamps and marks used by studio potters in Britain. Ever curious about the history and diversity of studio ceramics, he collaborated with John Anderson to make films of Rosemary and Denise Wren, Ladi Kwali, and David Leach. He also filmed Isaac Button, one of the last surviving makers of traditional terracotta garden pots. In line with his interest in film, as a founder member and council member of the Craftsmen Potters Association he arranged three successful film festivals showing potters' films from round the world. These were exhilarating events in introducing diversity and thought into what was often seen as the narrow world of studio pottery. He also organized the Craftsmen Potters Association archive at Aberystwyth University.<br>
<br>In 1987 the Fourniers retired from potting and settled in a more convenient if less exciting semi-detached property in Market Lavington, near Devizes. Visits to ancient sites in Crete and other Mediterranean islands enabled them to pursue their interest in early ceramics, while, as ardent wine buffs, they enjoyed wine tastings. Following Sheila's death in 2000 Robert Fournier continued to write, completing several novels and starting a memoir, which remained unfinished. He did, however, record his life story for the British Library National Sound Archive.<br>
<br>Slightly built and with a mischievous look, Robert Fournier was an amusing and wry companion, his success as a writer often overshadowing his fine and inventive work as a potter. By their very nature some potters are lifelong rebels, often selecting their profession because of its quirky, &#145;alternative&#146; lifestyle. Such is the case with Fournier. He was a lifelong pacifist and atheist, whose decision to become a potter was, in part, a refusal to compete in what he saw as an increasingly consumer-led society. He died in Market Lavington on 19 January 2008.<br>
