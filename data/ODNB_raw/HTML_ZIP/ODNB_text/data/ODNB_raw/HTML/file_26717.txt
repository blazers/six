<span class="headword">Stuart, Sir  John</span>  (1761&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Colonel John Stuart (1718&#150;1779) and his wife, Sarah Fenwick of Charles Town, South Carolina, was born in Georgia. His father was superintendent of Indian affairs for the southern department. A prominent loyalist in the American War of Independence, he died at Pensacola, Florida. At the end of the war his property was confiscated by the American government.<br>
<br>Young Stuart was educated at Westminster School and obtained a commission as ensign in the 3rd foot guards on 7 August 1778. He took part in the War of Independence, serving under Lord Cornwallis in the Carolinas; he was dangerously wounded in the battle of Guilford on 15 March 1781. On 6 November 1782 he was promoted lieutenant in the 3rd foot guards and captain in the army.<br>
<br>Ten years later, following the outbreak of war with revolutionary France, Stuart went with his regiment to Flanders as part of the force commanded by the duke of York (March 1793). On 25 April he was promoted to be captain in the 3rd foot guards and lieutenant-colonel in the army. His regiment formed part of the guards brigade which distinguished itself at Famars, Valenciennes, and Linselles. It also took part in the siege of Dunkirk, abandoned in October, and shared in the victory of Lannoy, won on 28 October; it then went into winter quarters. When hostilities resumed the following spring Stuart commanded his battalion in the assault on Landrecies and in subsequent battles around Tournai and Tourcoing. After the British army was forced to fall back on the line of the Waal, Stuart's battalion held Nijmegen until forced out on 9 November. He accompanied it in its retreat in the winter of 1794&#150;5 and its evacuation from Bremen on 14 April 1795.<br>
<br>Stuart was promoted brevet-colonel on 1 May 1796. On 30 November he was appointed to a command, with the rank of brigadier-general, in a force sent to Portugal under command of Sir Charles Stuart. He stayed with it until he joined an expedition to Minorca, again commanded by Sir Charles Stuart, in November 1798, being gazetted brigadier-general on the 10th of that month. When Minorca's garrison surrendered on 15 November it included 1000 ex-Austrian prisoners (mostly Germans and Swiss). They were enlisted into a regiment known as &#145;the Minorca&#146; (renamed in 1801 &#145;the Queen's Germans&#146;) and Stuart was given command of it.<br>
<br>Stuart accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby's force to Egypt in 1801, in command of the 5th brigade. This consisted of three foreign regiments, including the Minorca. It distinguished itself in the battle on 21 March fought on the plain of Alexandria. Its repulse of a cavalry charge ensured a British victory and received a commendation in general orders. The campaign over, Stuart was sent on a political mission to Constantinople and then returned to Egypt to command the troops left in Alexandria. He received the order of the Crescent from the sultan of Turkey for his services. He was promoted major-general with effect from 29 April 1802 and returned to England in that year.<br>
<br>On 17 October 1803 Stuart was appointed to command a brigade in the force stationed on the coast of Kent against a threatened French invasion. He held the command until 24 March 1805 when he accompanied Lieutenant-General Sir James Craig, who had been given command of all British land forces in the Mediterranean. The expedition, 5000 strong, which arrived at Malta on 18 July, was destined to assist the kingdom of Naples, in conjunction with a Russian force, with the aim of driving the French from Italy. Both forces landed in the Bay of Naples on 21 November 1805. Overall command was given to the Russian general Lacy, but Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz caused the tsar to order Lacy to re-embark his troops and return to Corfu. Craig, seeing no point in remaining, obeyed his instructions to safeguard Sicily, where he took his force in January 1806. It disembarked at Messina on 17 February, when the king of Naples allowed it to land, he and his family having fled to Palermo.<br>
<br>In April 1806 Craig, on grounds of ill health, resigned his command, which passed by seniority to Stuart. Stuart's naval counterpart, Vice-Admiral Sir Sydney Smith, reinforced the Neapolitan garrison at Gaeta, which still held out against the French, and captured the island of Capri, off Naples. Stuart supported the admiral's action by sending a regiment under Colonel Lowe to relieve the naval garrison of Capri. Stuart was allowed by King Ferdinand to raise a corps of Sicilian fencibles, clothed and paid by the British, organize a flotilla of Sicilian gunboats to protect the straits of Messina, and take command of the coastal area stretching from Milazzo to Cape Passaro.<br>
<br>Learning that the French forces in Lower Calabria that threatened Sicily with invasion were seriously depleted on account of the continuing siege of Gaeta, Stuart decided to strike a surprise blow. His aim was to drive the French from the province, destroying their batteries and magazines. With a force of 5200 men he landed in the Bay of Santa Eufemia on 30 June 1806. General Reynier did not wait to be attacked but unwisely abandoned a strong position below the town of San Pietro di Maida. The battle that ensued was won by the British, though Stuart was scarcely responsible, the victory being entirely due to the action of his subordinates and the skill and bravery of his troops. Yet Stuart got all the credit for it, receiving the thanks of both houses of parliament and a pension of &pound;1000 a year for life. He was made a knight of the Bath, created count of Maida by King Ferdinand, and received from the City of London its freedom and a sword of honour.<br>
<br>Reynier's army had been shattered, but Stuart was unable to pursue it to destruction. His troops were exhausted by the great heat and he lacked the necessary transport and cavalry. In any case his primary task remained the defence of Sicily and he had embarked on the operation without ministerial authorization. Stuart was a cautious general and, having overseen the capture of Scylla, which commanded the narrowest part of the straits, and placed a garrison in both it and Reggio, he was content to return to Messina.<br>
<br>Relations between Stuart and Sydney Smith, both vain men and both competing for the favour of Ferdinand's queen, were worsened when Stuart learned that Sydney Smith had been given viceregal powers in Calabria. There the admiral gave every encouragement to the local people to revolt. Stuart had issued a proclamation urging the Calabresi to join him, but once aware of their brutal treatment of prisoners of war, and that their primary interest was to wage class war in pursuit of plunder, he made public his disapproval, and Sydney Smith's viceregal commission was cancelled.<br>
<br>Stuart returned to Sicily to discover that command of land forces in the Mediterranean had passed to General Henry Fox, who had already arrived at Messina. On learning that Fox's second in command was to be Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, expected shortly with strong reinforcements, Stuart decided to resign. He had no wish to be subordinate to a man of whom he was bitterly jealous, Moore having won at Alexandria the fame to which Stuart felt himself entitled.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, on 11 February 1808 Stuart was again sent to the Mediterranean to assume command of the land forces there, Fox having resigned and Moore posted to another assignment. On 25 April Stuart was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. On arrival in Sicily he was confronted with the prospect of a serious French invasion attempt now that Joachim Murat was ruling in Naples. When the latter captured Capri in October 1808 morale in Sicily was badly affected. Stuart was partly to blame for the loss, having reinforced the island's garrison with an unreliable foreign regiment which surrendered to the French with little fight.<br>
<br>In 1809 Stuart was placed in a difficult situation by the British government: told first to send away regiments to Spain, in support of Wellesley's peninsular campaign, and then, when Austria re-entered the war, urged to make a major military diversion aimed at freeing the whole of Italy. In May he embarked a force numbering upwards of 11,000, but delayed sailing until 11 June. This delay caused great discontent among his subordinate officers with whom he was already very unpopular, but was caused by Stuart's extreme caution. He had learned of Austrian defeats in Bavaria and the withdrawal of their forces from northern Italy. When the expedition eventually sailed it was delayed by calm weather and arrived in the Bay of Naples only on 24 June. There it captured, with little resistance, the islands of Ischia and Procida. Stuart's further hesitation about what to do next afforded Murat the opportunity of concentrating his troops round Naples and making an assault on the city unwise. Urged by Admiral Collingwood to land his force on the Roman coast, from which French troops had been withdrawn, Stuart waited until too late. News of Napoleon's victory at Wagram and Collingwood's warning that the British fleet could not ensure the safety of the convoy if a French squadron escaped from Toulon, caused him to abandon the enterprise and withdraw at once to Sicily. This action embittered his relations with Palermo&#151;ones that were already under great strain.<br>
<br>Three months later, under pressure from Collingwood, Stuart dispatched a force of 1700 to capture four Ionian islands. Lord Liverpool, the war minister, approved Stuart's action if it protected Sicily better, but insisted that the islands' garrisons be reduced. In March 1810 Stuart was ordered to send four regiments to Gibraltar in exchange for three raw and sickly battalions, but he declined to obey the order. It was clear that Murat was preparing an invasion of Sicily. On remonstrating with London about the dangers Sicily was facing, not least the feared treachery of Ferdinand's queen and the court's refusal to allow him a unified command of British and Sicilians, Stuart was permitted to retain his regiments. He was told, however, that once the danger was past he must obey the original order.<br>
<br>Murat's abortive attempt at invasion took place on the night of 17 September. Thirty-five hundred French troops landed on the Sicilian coast 7 miles to the south of Messina. They were successfully repulsed by the British troops and Sicilian peasants. The major attack across the straits of Messina never took place as the French commanders, on Napoleon's orders, refused to run the risk of defeat. Though Murat removed the bulk of his forces Stuart felt sure the danger remained. Liverpool was unconvinced and renewed the order to send away troops. Stuart thereupon resigned on 16 October 1810. His resignation was accepted in April 1811. Despite his strained relations with the Sicilian court, the king offered him, on his departure, the order of knighthood of San Germano&#151;an honour he decided to refuse, in view of the delicacy of his position.<br>
<br>Having returned to England Stuart was appointed lieutenant-governor of Grenada. On 10 June 1813 he was given command of the western district but resigned on grounds of ill health on 24 June 1814. He was an outspoken critic of flogging in the army. On 3 January 1815 he was made a military knight grand cross in the Order of the Bath. He died at Clifton on 1 April 1815 and was buried in the south aisle of Bristol Cathedral on the 13th. A small marble slab marks the spot.<br>
