<span class="headword">Heyman, Sir  Peter</span>  (1580&#150;1641), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 May 1580, the eldest son of Henry Heyman (<i>d</i>. 1613) of Sellinge, Kent, and his wife, Rebecca, the daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13792/', "Robert Horne")</script>, bishop of Winchester. Admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1597, he studied under the puritan William Bedell. Shortly afterwards he served as a volunteer in Ireland, and was rewarded by the queen with some land there. By 1606 he had married Sarah (<i>d</i>. in or before 1613), the daughter and coheir of Peter Collett, a Merchant Taylor of London, with whom he had four children. Heyman was probably the William Hamond knighted on 20 December 1607. He married again in November 1613, when he took as his wife Mary, the daughter and coheir of another Merchant Taylor, Randolph Wolley, with whom he had six children. He succeeded to his patrimony in 1614.<br>
<br>Heyman was returned to the 1621 parliament as member for Hythe, the borough closest to Sellinge, after being recommended for the seat by the lord warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord Zouche. During the winter sitting he expressed dissatisfaction at the absence from the Commons of one of its leading figures, Sir Edwin Sandys, suspecting that it stemmed from the king's displeasure. Although the house received an assurance on 23 November from secretary of state Sir George Calvert that Sandys had not been committed for anything he had said or done in parliament, Heyman, on 27 November, repeated his demand that Sir Edwin be sent for. Consequently, he and William Mallory were dispatched to fetch Sandys or to obtain from him a written statement signifying whether his commitment was connected with parliament. The paper with which they returned was never reported because the king reiterated the assurance already given by Calvert, and on 19 December Heyman was ordered by the house to burn the document.<br>
<br>Heyman courted further royal displeasure in early 1622, when he was summoned before the council for refusing to contribute to the benevolence raised for the defence of the Palatinate. As a punishment&#151;and since he also declined to serve as a soldier at his own expense&#151;he was made to accompany Sir Arthur Chichester's eleventh-hour diplomatic mission to Heidelberg. He represented Hythe again in the Commons in 1624, when he seconded Mallory's proposal of 1 March to forbid the clerk of the Commons from entering the names of members responsible for motions. He also helped to draw up the charges of impeachment against the lord treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex, and was among the deputation sent to Archbishop Abbot to express the house's concern at the publication of Richard Montagu's anti-Calvinist tract, <span class="italic">A New Gag for an Old Goose</span>. Following the prorogation he captained a company of foot in Ireland, and though he returned to Kent to help muster the soldiers raised for Mansfeld's expedition his continued absence in Ireland meant that he was not elected to parliament in 1625. On relinquishing his commission in 1626 he resumed his parliamentary career. As member for Hythe he deplored the handling of the war with Spain, denied that shortage of money was to blame for recent failures, and supported the attempt to impeach the duke of Buckingham. Following the dissolution he was summoned before the council for refusing to contribute to the forced loan, but escaped imprisonment.<br>
<br>Heyman was re-elected for Hythe in 1628, when he participated in the debates on the liberties of the subject, expressing concern on 6 June at the king's first, unsatisfactory answer to the petition of right. He earned notoriety on 2 March 1629, when he rounded on the speaker, Sir John Finch, a fellow Kentishman, after Finch attempted to adjourn the house in obedience to the king's commands despite the wishes of many members. Heyman considered the speaker first and foremost the servant of the Commons, and &#145;bitterly inveighed against him, and told him he was sorry he was a Kentishman, and that he was a disgrace to his country and a blot to a noble family&#146;  (Notestein and Relf, 105). He was so incensed that he proposed that Finch should be brought to the bar and a new speaker chosen in his stead. The following day he and eight others were summoned to appear before the council to answer for their effrontery. Through the favour of Dudley Carleton, Viscount Dorchester, secretary of state, he was freed soon afterwards, but he was then swiftly recommitted to the Gatehouse prison on the instructions of the king. When asked what he would have done had he been ordered as speaker to announce the adjournment, he declared that he would have thrown himself at his majesty's feet and have given him to understand that, &#145;in respect he was the Speaker, he was the most improper and unfit person to deliver any such message, and therefore have supplicated his Majesty to command some other to perform that part&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 93, fol. 138). Charges were subsequently laid against him in Star Chamber, and on 22 May he put in his plea and demurrer. However, soon afterwards he was released after making a full submission, though he continued to be attended by one of his gaoler's men.<br>
<br>In 1640 Heyman was elected for Dover to both the Short and the Long parliaments. He died intestate early in 1641 and was buried at Sellinge on 11 February. He was succeeded by his son Henry, who had taken his former seat at Hythe and recently purchased a baronetcy.<br>
