<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sprat,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1713), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born at Beaminster, Dorset, and baptized there on 20 September 1635, the son of Thomas Sprat and his wife, whose forename is unknown but was of the Strode family of Parham, Devon. His father was probably the man who proceeded BA of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1629 and MA in 1632, was curate of Beaminster from 1631 to about 1641, and then intruded minister of Tallaton, Devon, from 1646. The elder Sprat may also have been vicar of East Greenwich, Kent, from about 1645 to September 1646, and possibly minister of Winterborne Dancy in 1649; he was buried at Tallaton on 12 May 1655.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundeducationandearlycareer"></a>Background, education, and early career</h2>The younger Sprat was educated in Tallaton and matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 12 November 1651. He was elected scholar on 25 September 1652 and took his BA on 25 June 1654 and his MA on 11 June 1657. His BD and DD followed on 3 July 1669; in 1671 he was incorporated at Cambridge. Sprat was a fellow of Wadham from June 1657 to 24 March 1670 and was elected catechist in December 1659.<br>
<br>Sprat's early career was literary. Among his early poems, which soon established him as a wit, were &#145;Ode on the English Ovid&#146; (1657), about his new friend Abraham Cowley, and his contributions to &#145;Naps upon Parnassus&#146; (1658). In 1659 Sprat published &#145;To the happie memorie of the most renowned prince, Oliver, lord protector&#146; in a panegyrical volume which included work by John Dryden and Edmund Waller. Dedicated, with lavish thanks, to John Wilkins, warden of Wadham, it was reprinted in 1682 under the curious title, &#145;To the happy memory of the late usurper&#146;, and appeared in a fifth edition in 1703. The poem was later held against him, yet it may reflect Sprat's wish to impress a useful patron more than his true political beliefs, since in 1659 he also published &#145;The Plague of Athens&#146;. An allegory on the English revolution the poem turns the plague of the Peloponnesian War into England's sin of disobedience and denounces the &#145;irreligion&#146; and &#145;tyrannous &hellip; pain&#146;. The style, imitative of Cowley, brought Sprat much praise and earned him the nickname Pindaric. It was reprinted some seven times by 1709. Sprat also vilified the army in a contemporary letter to his friend Christopher Wren. On 20 October 1660 Sprat was installed in the Carlton-cum-Thurlby prebend at Lincoln and, probably on 10 March 1661, he was ordained priest. Through Cowley, Sprat met George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, whom Sprat served as chaplain from the early 1660s and was one of three trustees for part of his estate from 1675. Sprat may have helped Buckingham write <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>. On 27 September 1663 Sprat delivered a sermon at St Mary's, Oxford, attended by the chancellor and various lords, and on the next day gave a speech before the king and queen at Wadham College.<h2>
<a name="TheHistoryoftheRoyalSociety"></a>The History of the Royal Society</h2>In 1663, on Wilkins's nomination, Sprat became a fellow of the Royal Society. At about the same time he was commissioned to write a &#145;history&#146; of the society&#151;a public statement of its aims, methods, and achievements, that might meet criticisms of the Royal Society's limited productivity in the three years since its foundation, and quell fears that experimental science would challenge the belief structures of Restoration society. Neither before nor after writing the <span class="italic">History</span> did Sprat demonstrate any interest in natural philosophy, even though he remained a member of the society until his death. His post as Buckingham's chaplain afforded him the leisure to write the <span class="italic">History</span>. Sprat's own motivation was probably that the commission allowed him to display his literary talents and associate himself with a company that afforded a chance to redeem himself politically and perhaps advance his career. The <span class="italic">History</span> was doubtless heavily influenced by Wilkins, the overseer of the project, but Sprat also built on earlier comments by Abraham Cowley, John Evelyn, and Joseph Glanvill. Sprat's praise of Wilkins in the <span class="italic">History</span>, often interpreted as evidence of Sprat's limited role as Wilkins's amanuensis, may have been in part the formulaic self-debasement of a client before mentor and patron and thus a trolling device for other patrons, too. As Dr Johnson said, Sprat was &#145;a very willing and liberal encomiast, both of the living and the dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Johnson's Lives of the Poets</span>, 2.41).<br>
<br>By November 1664 the <span class="italic">History</span> was reportedly almost finished and parts of it were probably printed shortly thereafter, but Henry Oldenburg was concerned that it provided insufficient evidence of the society's scientific productivity. In December 1664, therefore, the council of the society established a committee to select pertinent materials for inclusion. These appear as edited versions of fourteen papers read to the society between 1661 and 1664. The technological bent of all the papers expressed the society's wish to establish itself as of immediate, practical assistance to the nation. A further committee was established in May 1665 to review Sprat's text; Wilkins served on both committees. In 1667 Wilkins also produced an abridgement of the society's statutes for inclusion in the <span class="italic">History</span>.<br>
<br>The council's interventions were a response to Samuel Sorbi&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Relation d'un voyage en Angleterre</span> (May 1664). While generally complimentary to the Royal Society (of which he was a fellow), Sorbi&egrave;re criticized certain English institutions and implicitly challenged England's leadership in natural philosophy. Charles II forbade the Royal Society to answer the <span class="italic">Relation</span>. None the less, conscious that a failure to reply might jeopardize the society's prestige and support, Sprat set aside the <span class="italic">History</span> to write the very critical and unfair <span class="italic">Observations on Monsieur de Sorbier's &#145;Voyage into England&#146;</span> (1665), addressed as a letter to Christopher Wren. Sprat twisted Sorbi&egrave;re's comments to permit a more vehement defence. He challenged Sorbi&egrave;re's sketch of Hobbes and Bacon, emphasizing the differences between dogmatism and experimentalism, while privileging the society's Baconian methods. Sprat may have intended to distance the society from Hobbes, whose views were close to those of a number of fellows and had the potential to damage the society's reputation. He also denied that the society relied on books or on any modern authority, such as Pierre Gassendi or Ren&eacute; Descartes. Sprat also challenged Sorbi&egrave;re's criticisms of England's mercantile policies. In both the <span class="italic">Observations</span> and the <span class="italic">History</span> Sprat was conspicuously silent concerning the scientific Montfort Academy in Paris, officially established in 1657, and thus a challenge to the Royal Society's chronological primacy and England's leadership. Sorbi&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Relation</span> may also have pushed Sprat to write the contentious third part of the <span class="italic">History</span>, apparently wholly drafted after this episode, and possibly not overseen by Wilkins or the council. The <span class="italic">Observations</span>, extensive comments on English religion and politics, thus help to place the <span class="italic">History</span> in context.<br>
<br>Delayed by the plague and the great fire the book finally appeared in the summer of 1667 and was presented to the society on 10 October. Sprat received the society's thanks but the <span class="italic">History</span> did not receive their imprimatur. Given the great variety of scientific methods, as well as of political&#150;religious opinions among the fellows, any attempt to portray a corporate ideology of the society, beyond the general language of its charter concerning experiment and utility, was bound to be inaccurate. Sprat portrayed the society as an ideology-free collection of Baconian empiricists, interested only in the discovery and beneficial application of nature's secrets, and uninterested, at least for the present, in theorizing or in establishing laws. In combining a rationalist theology, Anglican and monarchist history, and a normative structure of scientific truth the <span class="italic">History</span> represented a proclamation (if not an actualization) of a broad consensus in early Restoration cultural politics.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">History</span> is divided into three parts. The first part offers an extended critique of various approaches to natural philosophy from ancient times to the current day. Sprat presents three main categories: first, scholastics, but also those moderns who having abandoned Aristotle established another ancient such as Epicurus as the new authority; second, those, principally the Cartesians, who sought to establish a modern authority; third, the modern experimenters. The second part of the <span class="italic">History</span> provides an explanation of the origins of the Royal Society, its experimental method, and its purposes. Here Sprat argues that co-operative scientific effort, as conducted and encouraged by the society, would lessen the antagonisms that led to civil unrest, and, as it included the manual arts, provide for the economic and social betterment of humanity. The society intended a &#145;<i>Philosophy</i>, for the use of <i>Cities</i>, and not for the retirements of <i>Schools</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 76). Part three responds to particular social, cultural, and religious objections to experimental philosophy, and predicts future political and economic leadership for England based on the society's contributions. Sprat portrayed the society (and experimental philosophy) as friends of the universities and their form of learning, as well as of rational Christianity and the church, and of the state.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">History</span> cannot be relied on as an accurate account of the founding, the breadth of views, or the immediate utility of the society. Sprat drew heavily on the iconic status of Francis Bacon (reinforced by Cowley's ode at the beginning of the <span class="italic">History</span>), to the point of deprecating other modern influences within the society. He also underplayed the breadth of hypothesizing and of mathematical activity in English natural philosophy in the 1660s. Sprat's construction of the society's Baconianism as almost random fact gathering (though he did criticize Bacon on this score) was contradicted by a number of the scientific &#145;reports&#146; included in the <span class="italic">History</span> itself. He was also disingenuous about interest within the society in alchemy and witchcraft. Sprat exaggerated the institutional and English nature of the Wadham group as founders of the society, perhaps as a political legitimation device directed against the foreign, parliamentarian, millenarian, and non-Anglican associations of the contemporary (and overlapping) London group of experimentalists.<br>
<br>Sprat attempted to privilege experimentalism by pushing to an extreme the convention among scientists of emphasizing things rather than words. Reports to the society, even exchanges among the fellows, themselves constituted &#145;things&#146;, since they reflected the scientist's own involvement as the witness of an event and therefore offered accurate representations of nature. In order to help incorporate the society's practices (as represented) into a pre-existing cultural consciousness, Sprat in effect recalibrated the terms &#145;experimental&#146; and &#145;witnessing&#146; from an individualistic Christian experience to a formal methodological tool for assessing and assimilating single experiences, involving rules and order. &#145;Truth&#146; was established through demonstrations at the society's meetings to members of the higher social orders, who were better equipped to reliably construct and approve &#145;truth&#146;. Since this co-operative experimental process would overcome the inherent problems of error or bias in the individual experimenter, Sprat downplayed any reservations, including even Robert Boyle's, concerning the reliability of experiments. Similarly, the moderate but regulated criticism allowed at meetings was represented as a ritualized harmonization within this public science. The experimental, non-dogmatic study of nature &#145;never separates us into mortal Factions&#146; and, unlike the enthusiasm and dogmatism of the immediate past, permitted fellows &#145;to raise contrary imaginations &hellip; without danger of a Civil War&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 56).<br>
<br>Sprat also associated the society with the &#145;universal Disposition of this Age&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 374) for a rational religion. He acknowledged the objection that concentration on secondary causes and the growing emphasis on purely mechanistic explanations reduced emphasis on a providential God. Some scientists did seem &#145;inclinable to irreligion&#146; and had &#145;brought a discredit on <i>Knowledge</i> itself&#146;  (ibid., 375), but he argued that those wayward in religion would have held the same views whatever their profession. Experimental knowledge protected church and state against &#145;the wild amuzing mens minds, with <i>Prodigies</i>, and conceits of <i>Providences</i> [which] has been one of the most considerable causes of those spiritual distractions, of which our Country has long bin the <i>Theater</i>&#146;  (ibid., 362). Religion constituted &#145;the perfection and the crown of the Law of <i>Nature</i>&#146;  (ibid., 368). According to Sprat the church's increasing emphasis on fundamentals matched the underlying natural truths available to experimental philosophy, while the stress on morality and practical divinity paralleled the society's devotion to utility. The church and the society were thus natural allies.<br>
<br>To overcome remaining doubts Sprat contended that experimentalism constituted a parallel religious exercise. Experimentalism and England's protestant church both dated from, and were defined by, a reformation, that is, an attempt to return to the basic &#145;things&#146; of nature or &#145;the plain and unquestion'd parts of the <i>Word of God</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 370). So while the fellows avoided meddling with &#145;<i>Divine things</i>&#146;, by &#145;long studying of &hellip; the accidents which belong to <i>humane bodies</i>&#146;, there might, &#145;without question, be very neer ghesses made&#146; concerning the operations of the soul, &#145;and that too, without destroying its <i>Spiritual</i> and <i>Immortal</i> Being&#146;  (ibid., 82&#150;3). Christ himself had been an experimentalist, emphasizing the works he performed. Experimentalism even inculcated Christian virtues such as diligence and modesty. As well, the society's utilitarianism would fulfil Christ's insistence upon improving the lot of the poor. The society's admission of Romanists, far from being a mistake, opened the door to a new, non-political eirenicism based on shared knowledge.<br>
<br>In support of the argument for the society's utility, Sprat transformed certain long-standing, authoritative political&#150;religious conventions, including that of England as Israel. Sprat argued that the aggrandizement of England's financial power through experiment and trade was both necessary and moral. God had designed the English to be best able to comprehend and exploit nature, a task Sprat portrayed as part of the race among nations and churches. Evidence of God's continued favour towards England was now to be located in the material realm of wealth rather than in the immaterial sphere of private revelation and sacrifice. Much of this&#151;for example, the anti-Dutch remarks&#151;was set in the developing language of interest, linking the Royal Society and the increasingly fiscally active state in a new political economy. There was, however, a contradiction in Sprat's dual advocacy of international co-operation and England's primacy that also mimicked Bacon.<br>
<br>Wilkins's general influence, in particular the <span class="italic">History</span>'s construction of a symbiotic relationship between rational religion and natural philosophy, has led some historians to label the <span class="italic">History</span> as latitudinarian. While many positions in the <span class="italic">History</span> are similar to those expressed by people commonly called latitudinarians, they were also fairly conventional, while the term &#145;latitudinarian&#146; is at least very fluid for the early Restoration. Sprat is not named in contemporary discussions of latitudinarians, nor is there evidence that he participated in comprehension schemes in the 1660s. An overtly latitudinarian stance would also not have suited some members of the society's council. Thus, no such classification can safely be made concerning the <span class="italic">History</span>, though Sprat's later views were decidedly anti-latitudinarian.<br>
<br>Oldenburg praised the <span class="italic">History</span> in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> but still, dissatisfied with Sprat's summary of the society's achievements, encouraged Glanvill to write the <span class="italic">Plus ultra</span> (1668). There was also much praise of the <span class="italic">History</span>'s plain style from Oldenburg, Glanvill, and Cowley, the last suggesting that it offered a &#145;judicious&#146; style incorporating &#145;all the comely Dress without the paint of Art&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, sig. B3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Sprat admitted that he had adopted a contentious style to respond to the society's &#145;Detractors&#146; and their &#145;Objections and Cavils&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, sig. B4<i>v</i>). Opponents reacted sharply. In seven books and pamphlets in 1670&#150;71 Henry Stubbe vilified the society, Sprat, and Glanvill, accusing them of attacking the universities, encouraging vice, even promoting a Catholic plot inspired by the writings of Tommaso Campanella (1568&#150;1639). Sprat's comment that a &#145;mechanical&#146; education might henceforth be more suitable than the traditional &#145;methodical&#146; approach brought forth a vehement defence of a humanist, word-based culture and learned values. If the society were to abandon the ancient connection between knowledge and virtue England would lack people trained to offer a rhetorical defence of true religion. Sprat was conciliatory to the work of the universities, even condemning iconoclasts who came &#145;as furiously to the purging of <i>philosophy</i>, as our <i>Modern Zealots</i> did to the <i>Reformation</i> of <i>Religion</i>&#146;  (ibid., 328&#150;9), but there was much disapproval in the universities concerning the society's perceived threat to their status.<br>
<br>Stubbe and others also argued that a materialist philosophy fostered &#145;atheism&#146;, an amorphous term commonly associated with personal immorality, scepticism, secularism, republicanism, and &#145;scoffing&#146;. Sprat had taken pains to dissociate the society from scepticism, but Robert South, preaching at Westminster Abbey in 1667, termed the Royal Society a &#145;diabolical society&#146; for &#145;finding out new experiments of vice&#146; which he tied to &#145;that profane, atheistical, epicurean rabble&#146;  (R. South, <span class="italic">Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions</span>, 1823, 1.375). South delivered a similar diatribe at the dedication of the Sheldonian Theatre in July 1669, at which Sprat may have been present. Meric Casaubon, another forceful critic, alleged that Sprat's mechanist philosophy too easily led to atheism. Several fellows rigorously contravened contemporary moral standards, which made the charge more credible.<br>
<br>Glanvill published two replies to the attacks and there were also anonymous defences of the society and of experimental philosophy, but Sprat himself did not respond. The society refused to amend or disavow the <span class="italic">History</span>. An unofficial French translation appeared in 1669 and 1670; the absence of a Latin edition (though planned) brought some contemporary complaint. Perhaps because of the society's unease the <span class="italic">History</span> was not reprinted until 1702, with subsequent reprints in 1722 and 1734.<br>
<br>Sprat also shared the interest of the Royal Society's council in reforming the English language. He argued against Sorbi&egrave;re that much of the corruption of English style in the revolutionary era had already been overcome. That the council desired to direct further reform towards &#145;Philosophical purposes&#146; is evident in its instructions to a committee established in December 1664  (RS, minutes of council, vol. 1, 1663, &#145;The Journal Book&#146;, p. 83). Sprat did not mention this committee in the <span class="italic">History</span>, but did note that John Wilkins, appointed to guide the committee, was himself working on a &#145;universal character&#146;, a language based on sense experience which would encapsulate the things-in-themselves. Sprat stressed the society's method of making &#145;faithful <i>Records</i>&#146; and a plain style reporting of observed &#145;facts&#146;, &#145;barely stated, without any prefaces, apologies or rhetorical flourishes&#146; in order to avoid the &#145;many mists and uncertainties&#146; that &#145;specious Tropes and Figures have brought on our knowledg&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 61). The ideal was to recapture &#145;primitive purity and shortness, when men deliver'd so many <i>things</i> almost in an equal number of <i>words</i>&#146;  (ibid., 112&#150;13). Against the mythology-based wit of ancient poets the society would provide &#145;Ornaments which are <i>Tru</i> and <i>Real</i> in themselves&#146;  (ibid., 414). Thus, studying nature, which contained an &#145;inexhaustible Treasure of <i>Fancy</i> and <i>Invention</i>&#146;  (ibid., 413), could improve wit. The plain style required that &#145;<i>eloquence</i> ought to be banish'd out of all <i>civil Societies</i>, as a thing fatal to Peace and good Manners&#146;  (ibid., 111).<br>
<br>Sprat's interest in language reform was broader than the council's. He praised Pelisson's <span class="italic">History of the French Academy</span> (1657), on which he perhaps even loosely modelled the structure of the <span class="italic">History</span>, and supported the founding of an English language academy to act as an &#145;Impartial Court of Eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 43). In a letter to Christopher Wren in 1663 he suggested that wit was not commonly found &#145;among Men of large and full and high Thoughts&#146; whose strength lay in devising &#145;general Axioms&#146;. But while axioms were more useful, &#145;yet they do not affect our thoughts with such an immediate and familiar Delight&#146;  (Wren, 2.259). Wit &#145;must apply itself to the Condition and Inclination of the Company&#146;  (ibid., 258) and, as he soon afterwards argued, in its &#145;true perfection&#146; be &#145;plyable to all occasions, to walke or flye, according to the Nature of every subject&#146;  (T. Sprat, &#145;An account of the life and writing&#146;, <span class="italic">The Works of Mr Abraham Cowley</span>, 1668, sig. D<i>v</i>). That Sprat adopted a more Ciceronian style in his own sermons may indicate that the <span class="italic">History</span>'s comments on dispassionate rhetoric and mathematically plain language were heavily influenced by the council's instructions and were probably intended by Sprat to be limited to natural philosophy. Sprat's disappointment that Cowley died before undertaking his own work on style also indicates Sprat's belief that his own comments in the <span class="italic">History</span> were insufficient. Samuel Butler, a contemporary, commented on the contradiction between Sprat's rhetorical recommendations and his own literary style.<h2>
<a name="Churchcareerfamilyandpolitics"></a>Church career, family, and politics</h2>In 1668 Sprat wrote a Latin panegyric for Cowley, who had died in 1667. An expanded English version, &#145;An account of the life and writing&#146;, was included in Cowley's <span class="italic">English Works</span> (1668), published by Sprat in accordance with Cowley's will, though Sprat and Martin Clifford decided against publication of Cowley's letters. Sprat's defence of Cowley's &#145;Mistress&#146; was denounced by Edmund Elys. In addition to clarifying Sprat's views on language the &#145;Life&#146; attempted to rehabilitate Cowley by suggesting that anyone who had &#145;dissembled their Counsels&#146; under Cromwell had been &#145;one of the greatest helps to the King's Affairs&#146;  (Sprat, &#145;Life&#146;, sigs. A<i>v</i>&#150;A2). Given Sprat's own difficulties this perhaps constituted a public <i>mea culpa</i>. Sprat also composed Cowley's epitaph in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>In February 1669 Charles II nominated Sprat to a prebend of Westminster Abbey. On 22 February 1670 he was instituted to the rectory of Uffington in Lincolnshire (presented by the duke of Buckingham) and, because of a legal technicality, was later instituted (April 1670) on presentation by the king. Sprat was also licensed to preach in the diocese of Lincoln. There is no evidence that he lived at Uffington, though in 1680 he brought a complex tithe case against a parishioner. In July 1670 Sprat received a licence to accompany Buckingham to France and in August 1676 he became a royal chaplain.<br>
<br>Sprat married Hellen Wolseley (1647&#150;1726) in October 1676. She was of the Wolseley family of Ravenstone, Staffordshire; her will mentions her grandfather Sir John Zouch and her grandmother Lady Wolseley. The Sprats had two sons. Thomas, born on 5 April 1679, proceeded BA of Christ Church in 1701 and MA in 1704, and among his clerical posts was a chaplaincy to his father (1704). The younger Thomas Sprat died in May 1720, as archdeacon of Rochester and prebend of Westminster. The Sprats' second son, George, was baptized on 12 October 1682 and died on 1 October 1683.<br>
<br>In September 1679 Sprat became curate and lecturer of St Margaret's, Westminster. He developed a reputation as a preacher, emphasizing the primitive quality of the Church of England and frequently attacking enthusiasm. He was clearly regarded as a close supporter of the king. On 22 December 1680 both Sprat and Gilbert Burnet preached before the House of Commons. Burnet was thanked but Sprat was not, Burnet says, because he had questioned the Commons' sense of duty to the king. Perhaps as a result, on 14 January 1681 Sprat was installed as canon of the Chapel Royal at Windsor. In March 1681 Sprat reputedly supported James, duke of York, in a sermon to the Commons at Oxford; again he received no thanks. A sermon of 1682 argued a duty of &#145;Christian submission&#146; and the impossibility of a morally just struggle against one's monarch  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Artillery Company of London</span>, 1682, 5). In the preface to the printed version Sprat contended that &#145;Enemies of our Church and State&#146; disliked the sermon. He was installed as dean of Westminster on 21 September 1683, resigning his Westminster canonry and his post at St Margaret's, despite his plea to Archbishop William Sancroft noting the deanery's limited revenues and his fear that he would be unable &#145;to maintain any tolerable reputation, or even to avoid contempt, if I should be straightened in the support of such a dignity&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 34*, fol. 119). This may have been one of the roots of Sancroft's jibe that income was all important to Sprat. On 2 November 1684 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester, receiving a royal dispensation to retain his deanery, but he had to resign Uffington and the canonry at Windsor. In 1685 Sprat was bequeathed land worth around &pound;25 per year on condition that he pay &pound;200 towards the discharge of his mother's debts.<br>
<br>Shortly after Sprat's appointment to Westminster the king had asked him to write an account of the Rye House plot. <span class="italic">A True Account and Declaration of the Horrid Conspiracy</span> (1685) was based on the documentary evidence of the case. It condemned zeal and proved particularly hostile to William, Lord Russell, while also criticizing Burnet. That both Charles and then James II &#145;made divers alterations&#146; to the text may help to explain the extreme vilification of the conspirators  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 31, fol. 22<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). Despite refusing James's request to write a parallel account of Monmouth's rebellion Sprat became clerk of the closet in December 1685. However, rumours that he might be translated to York, or even to London, proved inaccurate. None the less he proved one of James's loyal servants. In July 1686 he was appointed to the new commission for ecclesiastical affairs, which also had authority to investigate the universities. He was involved in the notorious case against Henry Compton, bishop of London; in October 1686 Sprat and two other bishops were named commissioners to execute Compton's offices. Sprat also assisted at the degradation of Samuel Johnson, a minister who had argued that kings were subject to English law. In 1687 he signed the address from the church to James II, thanking him for his &#145;royal favours&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 504). Sprat also wrote prayers celebrating the queen's pregnancy, and, at royal command, later prepared a prayer and service for the new heir.<br>
<br>While many clergy refused to proclaim James II's declaration of indulgence in their churches, Sprat complied at Westminster Abbey. A schoolboy witness later recalled that Sprat had trembled while it was read. Sprat also ordered the abbey bells silenced amid celebrations of the acquittal of the seven bishops. However, on 15 August 1688 he quit the ecclesiastical commission. In his letter of resignation Sprat stressed his unwillingness to participate in punishing others who had acted &#145;on a principle of Conscience&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28876, fol. 146). Following Sprat's departure the commission immediately adjourned. James soon dissolved the commission; it was possibly Sprat's withdrawal that ended the commission's viability. As the invasion by William of Orange approached, Sprat and other bishops attended several audiences with James II, advancing the cause of a free parliament. As part of a concerted effort to ensure that the bishops' advice to the king was favourably represented Sprat wrote to Sancroft on 12 November offering his own version of the meeting on 6 November (&#145;The bishop of Rochester's relation&#146;). On 11 December, at the Guildhall, Sprat signed the &#145;Declaration of Lords Spiritual and Temporal about the Cities of London and Westminster&#146;, assenting to the provisional government of peers following James's flight. He also helped to write the prayer which gave thanks that &#145;our holy Reformed Religion was not overwhelmed with Popish Superstition and Idolatry&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 2409, 13 Dec 1688).<br>
<br>In January 1689 Sprat, who preferred a regency, opposed the argument in the Lords that James had abdicated. Yet in the same month he wrote prayers for William stressing gratitude for delivery from popery and the maintenance of England's liberty, as well as decrying further sedition in the state or schism in the church. Sprat's political malleability and public refashioning are again visible in the claims he made in two explanatory letters of his conduct, addressed to Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset and Middlesex, and published in February and March 1689. In the first letter Sprat claimed to have defended the English clergy against the ecclesiastical commission and to have protected Compton and the universities. In quitting the commission, and so in opposing the &#145;Counsels of Popery then prevailing&#146;, he had put himself under the king's &#145;severe displeasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter from the Bishop of Rochester</span>, 18). He also recorded his pleasure at being on the &#145;popular&#146; side for the first time since the Restoration. In the second letter he apologized for his attack on Russell and offered a general defence of his recent actions. He again claimed to have defended the clergy &#145;from the violent Persecutions of the Popish party&#146;, opposed the dispensing power, and called for a free parliament  (<span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, 15). He insisted that the established church had both saved England and suffered most. It was finally the trial of the seven bishops which had taught him &#145;what unalterable Bounds the Law has fix'd between the Just Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Legal Rights of the Subject&#146;  (ibid., 18). He proposed moderation towards those&#151;such as himself&#151;who &#145;happen'd to be employed in the late Times&#146;  (ibid., 59). Two anonymous replies of April and May 1689 attacked Sprat's credibility and called for punishment. Gilbert Burnet said that George, Baron Jeffreys, a co-commissioner, charged that Sprat himself had incited extremism.<br>
<br>On 4 March Sprat took the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II and on 11 April brought the crowns to the new monarchs and bore the chalice in the coronation ceremony. He was also appointed to a new ecclesiastical commission, established in September 1689, primarily to make the liturgy and prayer book more broadly acceptable. Sprat hosted the new commission at the Jerusalem Chamber in October and November 1689, even though he questioned its legality and soon ceased attending. In concert with Simon Patrick and Compton he suggested some revisions to the office of 5 November. His sermon preached before William and Mary on Good Friday 1690 was published &#145;by Their Majesties Command&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1692 Sprat, John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, James Cecil, earl of Salisbury, Sancroft, and others, were the intended victims of a plot devised by Robert Young and Stephen Blackhead. Sprat was arrested and examined by the privy council on suspicion of conspiring to restore James II. After ten days' confinement he was released to his residence but was placed under armed guard. At an inquiry on 10 June Sprat confronted Blackhead, who confessed. Each year thereafter Sprat celebrated 13 June, the date of his discharge, as a day of deliverance. Sancroft encouraged William Lloyd to urge Sprat to &#145;draw up the Narrative&#146;  (LPL, MS 3894, fol. 61). The result was <span class="italic">A Relation of the Late Wicked Contrivance of Stephen Blackhead and Robert Young</span> (1692) and <span class="italic">A Second Part of the Relation</span> (1692). The <span class="italic">Relation</span> also provides some personal detail, mentioning Sprat's weak eyes and asserting his methodical record keeping. Sancroft believed that Sprat's &#145;quick &amp; ready Witt &amp; Memory&#146; kept him from being &#145;clapt into prison&#146;  (ibid., fol. 63).<br>
<br>While Sprat's attendance at the Lords declined in the 1690s he remained active. In November 1692 Sprat disallowed the epitaph for the late poet laureate, Thomas Shadwell, on the grounds that it was too laudatory of plays to be permitted in a church. In 1694 he arranged the repair of the abbey organ at a cost of &pound;200. He performed the office of burial for Mary II on 5 March 1695. Thereafter he was involved in a complex dispute with the College of Heralds, not settled until December 1696, concerning legal rights to the funerary decorations. In February 1696 Sprat signed a manifesto disowning any sympathy for the Jacobite plotters recently executed. While he refused to sign either the association promising revenge if William met a violent death or a proposed loyalty oath, Sprat wrote in November 1697 an address congratulating William on his safe return from Europe, and stressing again the nation's delivery from &#145;Romish Superstition&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 3344, 29 Nov 1697). Sprat was involved in 1699 in the simony trial of Bishop Thomas Watson but absented himself from court rather than assent to the punishment. In the same year he directed the rebuilding and improvement of the chapel at Bromley Palace, his episcopal residence. Sprat officiated at the funeral of William, duke of Gloucester, on 9 August 1700. He also oversaw the commencement of Wren's extensive repairs to Westminster Abbey and later persuaded Queen Anne to donate a marble altarpiece. In 1700 he arranged for John Dryden to be buried in the abbey. His treatment of the poet John Philips (1676&#150;1709) was less generous. Certain lines on Philips's monument praised the unequalled greatness of Milton in composing blank verse; Philips had been a great admirer and imitator of Milton, but Sprat ordered the lines removed.<br>
<br>In a long-running dispute in convocation Sprat sided with the lower house and opposed the archbishop's right to prorogue convocation. In June 1701 he became a commissioner of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in America. While he did not attend meetings he helped support ministers, partly by sending books. He also helped prepare Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> for publication, which began in 1702, but denied altering the content. Sprat participated in William III's funeral on 12 April 1702 and read the service at the coronation of Anne on 23 April. Rumours that Anne would make him lord almoner or primate of Ireland proved false. Sprat wrote various addresses to the new queen, including one, in April 1708, which emphasized Anne's &#145;undoubted Right to your Imperial crown and Dignity&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 4431, 29 April 1708). On 13 November 1708 Sprat officiated at the burial of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark. In 1709 he became one of the charitable commissioners for palatine refugees dwelling in London. In the same year Sprat was a member of a number of committees investigating the Sacheverell affair. He supported Henry Sacheverell in the Lords and voted on the minority tory side against both impeachment and sentence. He was also active in seeking funds for the repairs to Westminster Abbey and in September 1711 he became one of the commissioners for building fifty new churches in London. Burnet says Sprat was the lone bishop who in 1712 opposed the resolutions in convocation that only ministers could legally baptize but that no baptism should be repeated.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentanddeath"></a>Assessment and death</h2>Collections of Sprat's sermons were published in 1697 and 1710. His writings were not systematic but his various works&#151;including eleven sermons published between 1676 and 1694 and the lengthy <span class="italic">Discourse Made by the Lord Bishop of Rochester to the Clergy of his Diocese</span> (1695), as well as John Evelyn's notes on many of his unpublished sermons&#151;reveal a consistent support for both political authority and for the Church of England, though he held that the church's duty was always &#145;to keep itself in a due Submission to the Civil Magistrate&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 370). His later works built on his comments in the <span class="italic">History</span> that he favoured a religion composed of &#145;sound, sober, intelligible Doctrines, in plain, practicable, rational Precepts&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the King at Whitehall</span>, 1676, 7). At the same time his sermons and political writings indicate a firmer approach on many questions as his career developed. In his <span class="italic">Discourse</span> (1695) he blamed the neglect of catechizing for the &#145;profane enormity of manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 266) which had led to the civil wars.<br>
<br>Sprat's ecclesiastical views and his interpretation of the Reformation seem heavily influenced by Richard Hooker, perhaps as refashioned by Isaak Walton, whose work was known to Sprat. The Reformation emerges as an attempt to liberate both reason and the English throne from illegitimate subjection to the pope, rather than as primarily a doctrinal breach. While Sprat was critical of Romanist theology some way of recognizing the legitimacy of the Roman church was not untoward. Yet he moved from a denunciation of anti-Roman rhetoric as late as 1685 to a position, more political than theological, that the Church of England was &#145;irreconcilable with the Interests of Popery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 67&#150;8). Sprat worried more about dissent. In his view Calvinist doctrine had been added later to an already existing <i>via media</i> Church of England. While &#145;comeliness of worship&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd before the Lord Mayor</span>, 1682, 4) was important the basis of faith was the word preached, though not extempore. Sprat rejected double predestination, stressing instead free human co-operation in grace and a moralist theology which downplayed theological differences. Works, while not &#145;meritorious&#146;  (ibid., 7), were of &#145;absolute necessity to salvation&#146;  (ibid., 37). While acknowledging the moral rectitude of individual dissenters he forcefully opposed changes in the church's liturgy to accommodate nonconformists. Ralph Thoresby thought a sermon of Sprat's in 1683 &#145;too full of severity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.157) against dissenters. Sprat also defended the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and insisted that claims of a &#145;tender conscience&#146; against the church were specious  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Anniversary Meeting of the Sons of Clergy-Men</span>, 1678, 30). Typically, he hoped that one effect of the union of 1707 would be that Scottish presbyterians would &#145;lay aside all Bitterness and Animosity&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 4350, 21 July 1707).<br>
<br>Sprat followed a reasonably consistent neo-Stoic approach to political obligation and right. His attacks on zeal are consistent with a Lipsian desire to detach oneself from the passion that could jeopardize the existence of either the self or the state. Private interests should be subordinated to those of the commonwealth: hence his denunciation of the German radicals for having set &#145;inward sanctity, and Inspirations&#146; above the public &#145;Obligations of Virtue, and Obedience&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd before the Lord Mayor</span>, 1682, 12). In England this behaviour had culminated in the civil war and Commonwealth. Sprat linked right-of-resistance theory with presbyterianism, denounced the idea of popular sovereignty, and denied that England had a mixed constitution. Even under an idolatrous ruler passive obedience was required: for the subject to fight &#145;against the lawful prince for the Cause of God&#146; was to set one religious principle against another  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Artillery Company of London</span>, 1682, 22&#150;3). In a dramatic reversal of the resolution of the Commons in 1629 Sprat insisted that &#145;whoever would subvert the State, they are mortal enemies to Religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd before the Lord Mayor</span>, 1682, 41). For Sprat, therefore, it was the &#145;glory of the <i>Church</i> of <i>England</i>, that it never resist'd Authority, nor engag'd in Rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Observations on Monsieur de Sorbier's &#145;Voyage into England&#146;</span>, 1665, 114). Yet his common emphasis on &#145;prudence&#146; drew the line at what Lipsian neo-Stoicism termed &#145;great deceit&#146;  (ibid., 79&#150;80). His explanation for quitting James's ecclesiastical commission was at least consistent with his earlier opinion that &#145;Law, and &hellip; the strict rules of Justice&#146;  (ibid., 169&#150;70) bound the exercise of authority. He later allowed, without ever elaborating, that those who held &#145;Lawful, Public Authority in Church, and State&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Anniversary Meeting</span>, 37&#150;8) might go beyond reproof and complaints.<br>
<br>In June 1712 Sprat attended the Lords for the last recorded time. On 24 February 1713 Atterbury noted that Sprat and another bishop were &#145;much decayed in their understandings, and have lost all spirit and firmness of mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Epistolary Correspondence</span>, 3.317&#150;18). On 20 May 1713 Sprat died, reportedly of apoplexy, at his palace at Bromley. He was buried on 25 May in Westminster Abbey, on the south side of St Nicholas's Chapel. A monument with a long inscription by Dr John Freind stands in the south aisle, near the west door, moved there from the chapel. Sprat's will left his small estate to his son, with a life interest for his wife; it also stressed his previous generosity to his family. His wife, Hellen, died on 26 February 1726, and was buried near her husband in St Nicholas's Chapel on 3 March. Atterbury's and the earl of Ailesbury's view that Sprat was very liberal in his hospitality but restrained in his personal appetites contrasts with other contemporary opinion about his love of good living. Sprat also faced much criticism as a time-server. Burnet offered the harsh summary that Sprat's &#145;lazy, libertine course of life, to which his temper and good nature carried him, without considering the duties, or even the decencies of his profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 6.176) had &#145;brought no sort of honour&#146; to the party he served  (ibid., 4.527).<br>
<br>Sprat's literary style has also excited a range of opinion, his prose generally faring better than his poetry. John Evelyn praised Sprat's pulpit technique, particularly his &#145;never making use of notes&#146; and his &#145;most pure and plain style &hellip;, full of matter, readily expressed&#146;  (Walcott, 121). John Hughes thought Sprat's language &#145;united the most Charming Elegance to the strictest Propriety, and is witty without the least shadow of Affectation&#146;  (Hughes, 84). Pope listed Sprat among English prose authors from whom an authoritative dictionary for writers might be drawn. Bentley called Sprat &#145;our English Cicero&#146;  (Bentley, xcvi), but the nonconformist Philip Doddridge, while praising Sprat's beautiful language, criticized his Ciceronianism, commenting that &#145;Tully is translated for many sentences together in some of his Sermons, though not mentioned&#146;  (Doddridge, 28). Dr Johnson thought Sprat's epitaph on Cowley &#145;too ludicrous for reverence or grief, for christianity and a temple&#146;  (Johnson, &#145;Essay&#146;, x&#150;xi). Macaulay, too, regarded Sprat's poetry as that of a &#145;servile imitator&#146; but insisted that his prose writings established him as &#145;a very great master of our language&#146;  (Macaulay, 2.748). At the start of the twenty-first century, Sprat is known almost solely for the <span class="italic">History</span>.<br>
