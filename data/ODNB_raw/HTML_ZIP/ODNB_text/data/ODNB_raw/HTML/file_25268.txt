<span class="headword">Shaw,  Stebbing</span>  (1762&#150;1802), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born about the spring of 1762, apparently at or near Stone, Staffordshire. His father, also named Stebbing (1736/7&#150;1799), was the son of John Stebbing Shaw of Stone, and was rector of Hartshorne, Derbyshire, from 1769 and also of Seckington, Warwickshire, from 1785. The elder Stebbing's first wife was evidently the daughter and heir of John Hyatt of Stallington in Stone parish, and the younger Stebbing was their only child. His father had another son and two daughters by a second marriage.<br>
<br>Shaw was educated at Repton School, Derbyshire, where he acquired a taste for literature and a lifelong enthusiasm for the violin. He was admitted pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1780 and graduated BA in 1784, MA in 1787, and BD in 1796. He was elected scholar in 1784 and fellow in 1786, in which year he was also ordained. Probably in 1785 he went to live at the home of Sir Robert Burdett, a family friend, at Ealing as tutor to Sir Robert's grandson Francis. In 1788 he published an account of a tour the previous year to the western highlands of Scotland and in 1789 an account of a tour in 1788 to the west of England. Also in 1789 he was admitted to the reading-room of the British Museum. Between that year and 1792 he and his friend Samuel Egerton Brydges produced four volumes of a periodical called <span class="italic">The Topographer</span>; in 1792 there were seven numbers of a continuation, <span class="italic">Topographical Miscellanies</span>. Shaw later stated that it was Brydges's enthusiasm for antiquarian pursuits since their time together at Queens' which inspired his own efforts. In the summer of 1791 he went to live with his father at Hartshorne, and in the autumn he began work on the history of the neighbouring county of Staffordshire. That was to be his main occupation for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Shaw was indefatigable in his research. His former headmaster at Repton, William Bagshaw Stevens, dined at Hartshorne in October 1792 and found Shaw &#145;busily immersed in Topography&#146;; the following August Stevens described him as &#145;pregnant with Topography&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Revd William Bagshaw Stevens</span>, ed. G. Galbraith, 52, 93). Shaw made many tours of Staffordshire, working in the muniment rooms and libraries of the nobility and gentry and also making numerous drawings. He spent much of the year in London, where he lodged near the British Museum. He acquired large collections of manuscripts, by purchase, gift, or loan, and secured extensive help from scholars and other experts. In 1795 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1799 the British Museum accepted his offer of work on the Harleian collection, which was being catalogued. Also in 1799 he succeeded his father as rector of Hartshorne.<br>
<br>The first of Shaw's three projected volumes entitled <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Staffordshire</span> was published in 1798. It covered part of Offlow hundred (south-east Staffordshire) and the city of Lichfield, with introductory sections on the county as a whole. Volume 2 followed in 1801, covering the rest of Offlow hundred and all of Seisdon hundred (south-west Staffordshire, including Wolverhampton). Shaw had originally intended to include Cuttlestone hundred (the area to the north) but decided to hold it over; corrected proofs of part of that section existed by the time of his death. His diligence was not matched by his execution, which was unsystematic and hurried, and Lord Bagot's terse comment some years later is a fair judgement: &#145;What he did publish is full of <i>curious matter</i>, miserably ill arranged&#146;  (William Salt L, Stafford, S. MS. 478, Bagot). On the other hand Shaw's work was the first attempt at a large-scale history of Staffordshire, based on a wide range of sources and generously illustrated. At the least it has proved, along with his unpublished collections, a valuable quarry for later historians.<br>
<br>Shaw, who remained unmarried, was of a quiet disposition. His health was poor, and overwork combined with financial worry and sensitivity to criticism led finally to mental breakdown. In 1799 he confessed to his friend Samuel Pipe Wolferstan, the antiquarian squire of Statfold, near Tamworth, that &#145;he did not feel all his former alacrity for excursions&#146;  (Staffs. RO, D. 1527/24, 22 July). Such excursions during hot weather in 1800 brought on a fever and sleeplessness. In October 1801 he suffered a worse attack, during which he was totally deranged. As a result of another attack in London in the spring of 1802 he was removed for a time from the care of his half-sister Elizabeth into the keeping of a Dr Willis. In October he had a violent attack at Hartshorne and was taken for medical advice to London, where he died on 28 October. He was buried at Hartshorne on 6 November 1802.<br>
<br>Shaw's collections, including the printed stock, passed to his half-sister Elizabeth as his heir. In 1810 she sold the manuscripts to Samuel Pipe Wolferstan, who in turn sold them to his friend William Hamper in 1813. The same year Hamper bought Shaw's printed stock along with his copper plates and drawings from Elizabeth's husband John Gillam. After Hamper's death in 1831 his Staffordshire collections were sold to William Salt and are now in the William Salt Library at Stafford. The rest of Hamper's library was sold to the bibliophile Sir Thomas Phillipps. It included Shaw's own copy of <span class="italic">Staffordshire</span> with a set of the corrected proof sheets for the continuation of volume 2 bound in. This later passed into the ownership of Sheffield City Library in 1961.<br>
