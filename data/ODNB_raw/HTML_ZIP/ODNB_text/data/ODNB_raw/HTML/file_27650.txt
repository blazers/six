<span class="headword">Tracy,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1501, <em>d.</em> 1569), <span class="occ">religious activist</span>, was the fourth of five children of William Tracy of Toddington, Gloucestershire (<i>d</i>. 1530), and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Throckmorton (1462&#150;1530/1), of Coughton, Warwickshire. Before 1547 he married Barbara, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote (<i>d</i>. 1525); they had three sons, Paul, Nathaniel, and Samuel, and three daughters, Hester, Susan, and Judith. He was admitted BA at Oxford on 27 June 1515, and was admitted to the Inner Temple on 6 July 1519; he remained an active member of the Inner Temple, and was governor in 1549&#150;50. In 1529 he was returned to parliament for Wootton Bassett, perhaps as a client of Sir Edward Baynton or of Sir John Bridges; he probably sat for the same borough in the parliament of 1536, and may have done in 1539 and 1542.<br>
<br>The Tracys were one of the leading families of northern Gloucestershire, and during the 1520s they and some others in their circle became associated with early protestantism: the reformist martyr James Bainham was Richard's cousin. Richard himself first came to prominence through the affair of his father's will. William Tracy died on 10 October 1530, leaving a will which was a lengthy, uncompromising, and polemical exposition of his protestant understanding of justification. He was posthumously convicted of heresy by the convocation of Canterbury, and the chancellor of Worcester was ordered to exhume the body. He did so, but he also had the body burnt, and since there was no writ of <i>de haeretico comburendo</i>, this was illegal. Richard Tracy and his mother were the sole heirs and executors of the will (no mention is made of the elder son, also William), and Richard took up the cudgels on his father's behalf. In addition to his understandable outrage at the &#145;greate &amp; abhominable worldly shame don unto his kyndred in burnyng his roten bones&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/74, fol. 36<i>r</i>), he probably already shared his father's beliefs. He succeeded in having a fine of &pound;300 imposed on the over-zealous chancellor, and, perhaps more significantly, he seems in the process to have caught the eye of Thomas Cromwell.<br>
<br>In 1533 Cromwell granted Tracy Tewkesbury Abbey's manor of Stanway, Gloucestershire, against the express wishes of the abbot. Stanway was to form the core of the holdings which Tracy accumulated over the next eighteen years, of which the most important was to be a major part of the lands of Clifford Priory. He sat on the commission of the peace for Worcestershire from 1537 to 1547, and for Gloucestershire in 1547&#150;8; in 1539 he was shortlisted for, but not pricked, sheriff of Worcestershire. He worked closely with Bishop Latimer in the dissolution of the local monasteries, and when the blood of Hailes was declared to be fraudulent in 1538 the relic was left in Tracy's custody. Latimer wrote to Cromwell that he wished there were many more like Tracy.<br>
<br>Tracy's prosperity did not prevent his maintaining a genuine commitment to evangelical reform. One of the most public signs of this was the scriptural names that he chose for his children; his daughters' names in particular betray a distinctively reformist respect for the heroines of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. More practically he supported the zealous young Zwinglian Bartholomew Traheron through university after Traheron was orphaned, urging him &#145;to forsake the puddels of sophisters and to fetche water from the pure fountaynes of the scripture&#146;  (Vigo, sig. +2<i>v</i>). In 1540 he published a translation of a Latin work by John Frith, and in 1543 a pamphlet of his own on justification by faith. His <span class="italic">Supplycacion</span> of 1544, too controversial to be printed in England, combined a demand for doctrinal reform with one for the reform of the Commonwealth; these were themes he had first explored in an unpublished tract in the 1530s. In 1546 Tracy sent a message of encouragement to the imprisoned reformer Edward Crome, although John Foxe noted sourly that Tracy gave no help to the messenger when he was caught and tortured. After the death of Henry VIII, Tracy became more outspoken, publishing two tracts against the mass during 1548. However, his relationship with Edward VI's protectorate regimes was uncomfortable. Although he sat on the <span class="roman">Chantries Act</span> commission for Gloucestershire, he was removed from the commission of the peace in 1548, and from May 1551 to November 1552 he was imprisoned in the Tower, after an obscure incident in which he sent a &#145;seditious lettre and a lewde message&#146;&#151;presumably one derogatory to the duke of Northumberland&#151;to his friend Robert Keilway, MP for Bristol. In Mary's reign he remained in England, and although he was summoned before the privy council twice in 1555 for having &#145;behaved himself verye stubburnely&#146; in religious matters, both times he submitted  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1554&#150;6</i>, 181). In January 1556 he was troubled again, for objecting to the forced loan.<br>
<br>Tracy's fortunes revived with Elizabeth's accession. From 1559 to his death he sat on the commission of the peace for Gloucestershire, and he was sheriff in 1560&#150;61. However, his commitment to religious reform could still be obstinate. He preached weekly in Stanway church for a year early in the reign, in violation of the rubrics; in April 1565 he wrote to Cecil, warning brusquely that if the queen did not refrain from the use of images she courted &#145;great perrel off goddes wrath &amp; dyspleasure&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/36, fol. 77<i>r</i>). He died on 8 March 1569 at Stanway.<br>
