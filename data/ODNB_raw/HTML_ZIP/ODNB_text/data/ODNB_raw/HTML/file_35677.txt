<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rassam,  Hormuzd</span>  (1826&#150;1910), <span class="occ">archaeologist and civil servant</span>, was born in Mosul, Mesopotamia, then within the Ottoman empire, afterwards in northern Iraq. He was the youngest son and eighth child of Antun and Theresa Rassam, who were members of Mosul's Christian Chaldean community, his father being archdeacon of the uniate Chaldean church there. Originally the family were designers of muslins, once Mosul's staple product.<br>
<br>The family had British connections through the eldest son, <a name="cosubject_61547"></a><span class="headword">Christian Anthony <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Isa Antun]</span> Rassam</span>  (1808&#150;1872), who after five years' training with the Church Missionary Society in Cairo became the society's Arabic translator in Malta in 1832. There he joined the Church of England and married on 1 January 1835 Matilda Badger (<i>d</i>. 1867), sister of the Revd George Badger, missionary and Arabist; three months later he joined Francis Chesney's Euphrates expedition as principal interpreter (1835&#150;7), after which he accompanied W. F. Ainsworth on his two expeditions to Kurdistan and Asiatic Turkey (1837; 1838&#150;40) before returning to Mosul, his home town, where he had already, as from December 1839, been appointed British vice-consul. There he had a Scottish business partner, A. H. Ross, from 1844 to 1848, and &#145;brought the Yezidis into the 19th century&#146;  (Guest, 67). He died in Mosul on 30 May 1872.<br>
<br>As a child Hormuzd Rassam spoke Arabic and two dialects of Syriac. An Anglophile since boyhood, he learned English with the help of Maria Badger, his brother's mother-in-law, who also converted him to protestantism. In 1842 he first met, in his brother Christian's house, Henry Layard, who was then <i>en route</i> for Constantinople from Persia, and would become Rassam's mentor and lifelong friend. Three years later, when Layard returned to Mosul to begin his excavations of the mounds of Nimrud and Kuyunjik, he engaged Rassam, who was then working as a clerk for his brother, as secretary, paymaster, and general factotum. Rassam remained with Layard throughout this expedition, which lasted from October 1845 to June 1847.<br>
<br>Rassam travelled with Layard to England in December 1847 and spent some months in Oxford preparing to enter Magdalen College, but abandoned this idea when his brother Christian, who was funding his stay in England, persuaded him to return to Mosul with Layard. They reached Mosul at the end of September 1849 and Rassam worked with Layard in Assyria and Babylonia, as well as paying short visits to Van and Syrian Khabur before both men returned to London in spring 1851. Christian Rassam was left in charge of further work at Kuyunjik in their absence.<br>
<br>In 1852, Layard having decided to enter politics, the British Museum appointed Hormuzd Rassam on a two-year contract to continue Layard's work under the nominal supervision of Henry Rawlinson, the British consul-general and resident in Baghdad. Rassam left London for Mosul in August 1852 to begin his career as an archaeologist in his own right; he remained in Mesopotamia until August 1854 when he returned to England. During this time he made some remarkable discoveries at both Nimrud and Kuyunjik, among them Ashurbanipal's north palace, and its lion-hunt sculptures and cuneiform texts.<br>
<br>On his visits to England, Rassam was well received as the friend and close associate of the now celebrated Layard. He got to know Pusey and other leaders of the Oxford Movement but fell out with them over his evangelism. In 1854 he was invited by James Outram (whom he had first met in 1852) to become Arabic interpreter in Aden, where Outram was political agent. The British Museum hoped that Rassam would return to Mesopotamia but he opted for Aden, where he received steady promotion, becoming second then first assistant political agent. His main work was with the Arab tribes and he was commended and rewarded by the government of India for his handling of them during the Indian mutiny. He also became a magistrate, and was responsible for the post office, the municipality, and the waterworks. During 1860 and 1861 Rassam spent over a year in Muscat during negotiations for a settlement over Zanzibar, whose sovereignty was disputed between the sultan of Muscat and his brother.<br>
<br>Rassam's responsibilities in both southern Arabia and the African coast opposite led to his selection in 1864 for the delicate and dangerous mission, carried out under the aegis of the Foreign Office, of delivering a letter from Queen Victoria to Emperor Theodore of Ethiopia. This was an attempt to secure the release of the British consul, Charles Duncan Cameron, and a number of Europeans, among them Henry Aaron Stern and other missionaries, some with families, who had been working for the London Mission to the Jews. All were held prisoner in the Ethiopian highlands.<br>
<br>Rassam landed at Massawa in the Sudan, which was then under Egyptian rule, on 23 July 1864 and, apart from a short visit to Cairo, remained there for over a year before receiving Theodore's permission to enter Ethiopia. Accompanied by Lieutenant W. F. Prideaux of the Bombay staff corps and Dr Henry Blanc of the Indian Medical Service, Rassam eventually left Massawa in October 1865 on the long and difficult trek to Theodore's camp at Damot, where on 28 January 1866 he delivered the queen's letter to the emperor. At first all seemed to go well; the prisoners were released and allowed to join Rassam, and were ready to leave for the coast with him in April when the unpredictable Theodore had the whole party, including Rassam, arrested. They were taken to the mountain fortress of Magdala where they were put in chains, and where they remained until April 1868 when they were saved by the arrival of Sir Robert Napier and his troops from India. Remarkably, despite incarceration, Rassam remained on relatively good terms with the emperor and was able to communicate via Massawa with Aden.<br>
<br>Rassam reached London on 22 June 1868. His detailed report on his mission to Ethiopia was published in December as a parliamentary paper, together with a letter to him from the foreign secretary, Lord Stanley, expressing the British government's:<blockquote>high sense of your conduct &hellip; you appear throughout to have acted for the best, and your prudence, discretion, and good management seem to have tended greatly to preserve the lives and thus to secure the ultimate release of the captives. (&#145;Report&#146;)</blockquote>He was also awarded &pound;5000 as compensation for his four-year ordeal.<br>
<br>Before retiring on an India Office pension at the end of 1869 Rassam took leave, and on 8 June 1869 married Anne Eliza, daughter of Captain S. C. Price, formerly of the 72nd highlanders. He also had his two-volume <span class="italic">Narrative of the British Mission to Theodore, King of Abyssinia</span> published. There followed travels in the United Kingdom and the Near East before he settled in Middlesex, first at Twickenham and then at Isleworth.<br>
<br>On the death of George Smith of the British Museum in 1876, Rassam accepted the trustees' invitation to return to Mesopotamia, primarily to continue Smith's search for inscribed tablets, interest in Mesopotamian archaeology having been revived by Smith's decipherment of a fragment describing the biblical flood. Rassam reached Constantinople early in 1877, a few months ahead of his old friend Layard, Britain's new ambassador to the Porte. Layard was able to obtain for him two firmans permitting both the renewal of his earlier work and simultaneous excavations virtually anywhere in the provinces of Aleppo, Van, and Baghdad (modern Syria, eastern Turkey, and Iraq). However, before this he spent from July to December in Asiatic Turkey investigating for the Foreign Office the condition of the Christian minorities there. In January 1878 he reached Mosul at the start of four seasons' work for the British Museum, ending in July 1882. He was on his own without an assistant, artist, or camera. On returning to London at the end of both his first two seasons he resigned as he wished to remain at home but, as the museum was unable to find a replacement, dutifully agreed to carry on. Throughout this period Rassam concentrated on Babylonia but also initiated excavations in Assyria, Van, and Khabur, moving rapidly from one site to another after leaving a trusted overseer in charge. He made some exciting discoveries, among them the bronze gates of Shalmaneser II's Balawat palace and a cylinder fragment recording Cyrus's capture of Babylon. He also discovered Sippar (Abu Habbah), the biblical Sepharvaim, where he unearthed 60,000&#150;70,000 inscribed tablets and fragments. In all it is estimated that Rassam added some 134,000 such tablets, including some bought from dealers in Baghdad, to the British Museum's collection. Sadly, Rassam was unable to find a publisher in England and his account of the four expeditions, <span class="italic">Asshur and the Land of Nimrud</span>, was not published until 1897, and then in New York.<br>
<br>Rassam was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1868 and became a British subject by naturalization on 14 October 1870. He had five daughters and one son. After 1882 he lived mostly in Brighton and Hove. There he wrote articles on Assyro-Babylonian exploration, the Christian sects of the Middle East, and current religious controversy in England. He ended his life in disappointment and relative obscurity. His reputation suffered both in his lifetime and afterwards from criticism of his archaeological methods. Undoubtedly, prejudices against his oriental origin told against him; he was hurt by press criticism of his performance in Ethiopia and by poor public recognition of his discoveries, some of the more important being attributed to others, and above all by stories emanating from Wallis Budge of the British Museum that he and his Chaldean relatives had been involved in the theft of antiquities. It was small comfort to win &pound;50 damages against Budge in a libel action, which lasted five days in 1893. In this action he was strongly supported by Theophilus Pinches, then Britain's leading Assyriologist, and by Henry Layard, who had once described him as &#145;one of the honestest and most straight forward fellows I ever knew, and whose great services have never been acknowledged&#146;  (Waterfield, 478). In 1987, in tardy recognition of those services, the British Museum dedicated volume 7 of its catalogue of Babylonian tablets to his memory.<br>
<br>Rassam died at his home, 30 Westbourne Villas, Hove, on 15 September 1910 and was buried in a cemetery in Brighton. He was survived by his wife. The manuscript autobiography he left has since been lost.<br>
