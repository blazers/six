<span class="headword">Sullivan,  James</span>  (1903&#150;1977), <span class="occ">rugby player</span>, was born at 35 Elaine Street, Cardiff, on 2 December 1903, the son of Cornelius Sullivan, a labourer at an ironworks, and his wife, Mary Dobbin. He attended St Alban's School, Cardiff. He played for the Cardiff rugby union first fifteen when he was seventeen and remains the youngest player to have represented the Barbarians, at just seventeen years and twenty-six days old when he played against Newport on 28 December 1920. Within six months he had signed as a professional for Wigan for a fee of &pound;750.<br>
<br>Sullivan made his rugby league d&eacute;but for Wigan against Widnes on 27 August 1921 and kicked five goals. Within five years he had landed more goals than any other player in rugby league's history. In 1928 he became the first man to amass 1000 goals and by the time he retired in 1946 his tally was 2867 goals, a record which is still intact. His aggregate of 6022 points is second only to Neil Fox's 6220.<br>
<br>Among Jim Sullivan's record-breaking feats, his twenty-two goals for Wigan against Flimby and Fothergill in a challenge cup-tie in 1925 remains unbroken in first-class rugby league. No player in the game's history has exceeded his 928 appearances. One of his most astounding achievements was to kick at least 100 goals in every season between 1921&#150;2 and 1938&#150;9, a feat not remotely paralleled. In 1922&#150;3 he kicked 161 goals during the season to break Ben Gronow's record and in 1933&#150;4 set a new record with 194 goals. That season he became the first man to top 400 points in a season.<br>
<br>In 1924 Sullivan was in the first Wigan team to lift the challenge cup when it defeated Oldham 21&#150;4 at Rochdale. In 1929 he became the first player to score in a Wembley final and the first captain to lift the challenge cup there, when Wigan defeated Dewsbury 13&#150;2. He won three peacetime championships with Wigan and played in nine Lancashire cup finals. He was made player&#150;coach at Wigan in 1931 and made his last appearance for the club at Batley on 23 February 1946.<br>
<br>Tall and heavy, Sullivan presented a formidable problem to the opposition. Apart from his supreme ability as a goal-kicker, he possessed all the attributes necessary for a top-class full-back: uncanny positioning, enormous punting ability, fly-paper hands, and superb technique combined with devastating power in tackling. He is widely regarded as the finest full-back to have played the game. His skills were such that he was capped for Wales just eight days after his eighteenth birthday in 1921, before going on to win a record twenty-six Welsh caps, the last in 1939, when he kicked five goals in a 16&#150;3 victory over England at Bradford. His sixty goals and 129 points remain records for Wales.<br>
<br>At test level Sullivan won twenty-five caps against Australia and New Zealand. On his test d&eacute;but against Australia at Sydney on 23 June 1924, he landed a goal from inside his own half with his first kick of the ball in the first few seconds of the match. The Australians had a holy dread of Sullivan's power with the boot, for his kicking often decided test matches against them. He played in five consecutive Ashes-winning series between 1924 and 1933, and went on three Lions tours (1924, 1928, and 1932), the last of them as captain. In 1936 he was selected as captain for a record fourth tour but declined for domestic reasons. He still holds the Great Britain records for appearances (fifteen), goals kicked (thirty-one), and points scored (sixty-two) in Ashes tests. In all international rugby league he stands supreme with sixty caps, having represented Wales, England, Great Britain, and Other Nationalities, in the course of which he amassed 160 goals and 329 points.<br>
<br>After retiring as a player Sullivan became a phenomenally successful coach. Between 1946 and 1952 he guided Wigan to four championships, two challenge cups, six Lancashire cups, and four Lancashire league titles. He then took over at St Helens, and led them to their first challenge cup victory in 1956 and to the championship in 1953 and 1959. A fine golfer, snooker player, and cricketer, Sullivan also played baseball at international level for Wales. He was variously a boilermaker, butcher, haulier, masseur, and rugby league columnist for the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. His occupation was described as butcher when he married, on 24 November 1928 at St John's Roman Catholic Church, Wigan, Eva Linney Highton (<i>b</i>. 1903/4) of Wigan, the daughter of William Highton, a butcher. They had one child, Kevan. Sullivan died at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan, on 14 September 1977. His ashes were scattered on Wigan's ground, Central Park. His wife survived him.<br>
