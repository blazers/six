</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stonhouse, Sir  James</span>, seventh and tenth baronet  (1716&#150;1795), <span class="occ">physician and cleric</span>, was born on 9 July 1716 at Tubney, near Abingdon, Berkshire, the elder son of Richard Stonhouse (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1725), and his wife, Carolina, from whom James inherited an estate worth about &pound;200 per annum. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1722 and went on to Winchester College. He matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, on 15 January 1733, and graduated BA in 1736 and MA in 1739. He also paid a large sum to study medicine in London under the anatomist Frank Nicholls. Stonhouse spent two years training at St Thomas's Hospital and spent another two years abroad, in Paris, Lyons, Montpellier, and Marseilles.<br>
<br>On his return Stonhouse practised as a physician for a year in Coventry, where on 20 May 1742 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1747), eldest daughter of John Neale of Allesley, MP for Coventry. Oxford awarded him his BM in 1742 and his DM in 1746. Stonhouse moved to Northampton in April 1743 where he initiated the founding of the county infirmary. He compiled the statutes, rules, and orders for its government, modelling them on those of Winchester's hospital, and he acted as an honorary physician-in-ordinary to the infirmary until February 1757 when the pressure of professional engagements obliged him to resign. He continued to act as consulting physician. His success at Northampton was such that Mark Akenside's exertions to establish himself as a physician in the town between June 1744 and the winter of 1745 proved fruitless. Akenside withdrew to Hampstead taking with him an introduction from Stonhouse.<br>
<br>In his earlier years Stonhouse had been &#145;extremely licentious both in principles and practice&#146;. A confirmed infidel, he had been hostile to Christianity and had published a pamphlet against it which had passed through two editions; soon after coming to Northampton, however, his close friendship with Philip Doddridge and James Hervey led to his conversion. According to one account the change followed Stonhouse's hearing of a funeral sermon which Doddridge preached on one of Stonhouse's patients. Doddridge's sermons on &#145;the evidence of the gospel&#146; and the &#145;rise and progress of religion in the soul&#146; helped to persuade him further in the matter. Stonhouse's wife, Anne, died aged twenty-five at Northampton on 1 December 1747, leaving two sons. Her death was a cause for reflection and letters on her loss suggest that her death completed her husband's conversion.<br>
<br>Following these events Stonhouse published several small religious tracts. Those written while a practising physician in Northampton were particularly influential. His <span class="italic">Friendly Letter to a Patient, Just Admitted into an Infirmary</span> (1748), <span class="italic">Friendly Advice to a Patient</span> (1748), and <span class="italic">Spiritual Directions for the Uninstructed</span> (1748) give practical and moral advice to the sick poor. These all contain a set of plain and comprehensive prayers and give directions for the daily conduct of a Christian life. Purchased by the governors of the Northampton Infirmary and several other infirmaries for distribution to in- and out-patients on their admission, these tracts went through several editions and were long included in the <span class="italic">Religious Tracts</span> of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge.<br>
<br>Stonhouse also considered taking orders in the Anglican church, and in October 1748 Doddridge, without his knowledge, wrote to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke asking for some preferment for him should he do so. The chancellor replied politely, but declined to give any pledge. By this time Stonhouse had come to know George Whitefield, but was afraid of being branded as a Methodist. Nevertheless, one account holds that he ultimately took orders as a clergyman on Whitefield's advice  (Stanford, 113). Stonhouse continued to practise as a physician in Northampton and married Sarah Ekins (<i>d</i>. 1788), to whom Doddridge was guardian, on 18 November 1754. An only child, she was heir of the estate of Thomas Ekins, of Chester on the Water, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. In 1758 Stonhouse attended James Hervey in his last illness. His own health being impaired, he resigned his infirmary position in 1763 and moved to Bristol for the sake of the waters. The same year he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Hereford in Hereford Cathedral, and priest by letters demissory to the bishop of Bristol in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
<br>In May 1764 Stonhouse was appointed by Lord Radnor to the rectory of Little Cheverell, near Devizes, Wiltshire, which he held from December 1779 with the adjoining rectory of Great Cheverell. He also compiled the statutes and rules for the government of the Salisbury Infirmary (1766), of which Lord Radnor was president, and preached a sermon, <span class="italic">St Paul's Exhortation, and Motive to Support the Weak, or Sick-Poor</span>, before the governors of the Salisbury Infirmary (1771). His exhortations and devotional tracts, <span class="italic">Admonitions Against Drunkenness, Swearing and Sabbath-Breaking</span> (1769), <span class="italic">Prayers for the Use of Private Persons, Families, Children and Servants</span> (1773), <span class="italic">The Religious Instruction of Children Recommended</span> (1774), and <span class="italic">The most Important Truths and Duties of Christianity</span> (1778), went through several editions and were also widely disseminated by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. He was the author of <span class="italic">Hints from a Minister to his Curate, for the Management of his Parish</span> (1774), <span class="italic">Every Man's Assistant, and the Sick Man's Friend</span> (1788), and <span class="italic">Materials for Talking Familiarly with Children of All Ranks, on the Subject of Religion</span> (1795). Most of Stonhouse's tracts were republished as a collected work by his son, Revd T. Stonhouse-Vigor in 1822. Two volumes of letters from Job Orton and from Stonhouse to Revd Thomas Steadman were published in 1800, and Stonhouse contributed to the life and letters of James Hervey.<br>
<br>For many years lecturer of All Saints' Church, Bristol, Stonhouse spent most of the year at his house at Hotwells, Bristol. His second wife died of consumption on 10 December 1788 at Hotwells, leaving two sons and a daughter. Stonhouse moved to Hotwells permanently in 1789 and continued until the year of his death to minister occasionally at Bath and Bristol. He was once reproved by Garrick for his indecent haste while ministering in church, but Samuel Curwen praised his &#145;discourse serious and sensible&#146;  (Curwen, 154); &#145;His eloquence was simple, grand and energetic&#146;, and Richard Polwhele admired the &#145;fine inflexion of a voice distinct and sweet&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 65, 1795, 1076). A generous benefactor and supporter of many public charities, Stonhouse was also egotistical and fond of flattery. He succeeded a cousin, Sir James Stonhouse, as seventh and tenth baronet on 13 April 1792. He died at his home at Hotwells, Bristol, on 8 December 1795 after a brief illness, and was buried in the Dowry Chapel (later the church of St Andrew-the-Less) in the same grave as Sarah, his second wife. A friend, Hannah More, wrote metrical epitaphs on Stonhouse and his second wife, and a monument was inscribed to his memory in All Saints' Church, Northampton.<br>
