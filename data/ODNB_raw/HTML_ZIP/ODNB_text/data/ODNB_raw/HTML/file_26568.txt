<span class="headword">Stone,  Edward James</span>  (1831&#150;1897), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born in London on 28 February 1831, the elder son of Edward Stone. A sickly child, he spent his early years living with relatives in Devon and was a dull student until his late teens, when he began to demonstrate an ability for mathematics. His family persuaded him to enrol at King's College, London, from where he secured a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge. Although dogged by poor health, he graduated as fifth wrangler in 1859 and proceeded MA in 1862. He held a fellowship at his college from 1859 to 1872 and was readmitted as an honorary fellow in 1875.<br>
<br>Having been appointed in 1860 chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Stone learned the practical side of observing, but his lack of interest, coupled with his inability to withstand the rigours of night work, caused him to concentrate on theoretical astronomy. During his ten years at Greenwich he greatly improved the fundamental constants of astronomy. He was particularly concerned to find the distance of the earth from the sun, to which end he re-examined many existing measurements. From observations of the opposition of Mars in 1862 he deduced a parallax of 8.94 seconds of arc; from reworking observations made a century earlier during the 1769 transit of Venus, he now calculated the sun's distance as 91,700,000 miles, a value which agreed with that derived from the opposition of Mars. The gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to him in 1869 for this latter calculation. He married on 12 September 1866 Grace, the daughter of John Tuckett of Ide, Devon.<br>
<br>In 1870 Stone succeeded Sir Thomas Maclear as royal astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. By ten years' hard work he produced the <span class="italic">Cape Catalogue of 12,441 Stars for the Epoch 1880</span>, for which he was awarded the Lalande prize of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1881. He witnessed at the Cape the memorable aurora of 4 February 1872, and travelled to Nama Land to observe, with his wife's assistance, the total solar eclipse of 16 April 1874. At the Cape, too, he watched the transit of Venus on 8 December 1874, and, after returning to England on his appointment in 1879 as Radcliffe observer at Oxford, he organized the government expeditions to observe the corresponding event of 1882. In his report, presented in 1887, he carefully examined the baffling phenomena of &#145;contacts&#146; and concluded for a solar parallax of 8.85 seconds of arc. In the <span class="italic">Radcliffe Catalogue for 1890</span>, published in 1894, he completed his survey of the southern skies. It gives the places of 6424 stars between the equator and -25&deg; of declination.<br>
<br>Stone was a fellow of the Royal Society, presided over the Royal Astronomical Society during the term 1882&#150;4, and received the degree of doctor of science from the University of Padua in 1892. He made successful spectroscopic observations of the eclipsed sun at Novaya Zemlya on 8 August 1896, and planned an expedition to India for the eclipse of 22 January 1898. But his design was frustrated by his sudden death. He was a keen sportsman with rod and gun, and when resident in England would spend a portion of his holidays at his favourite pursuit of fly-fishing on Scottish or Irish rivers. Only a week before his death he was fishing in north Wales when his boat overturned. He righted it, but in his haste to get to shore he rowed too fast and strained his heart. Pneumonia set in on his return to Oxford, and after a few days, on 9 May 1897, at the Radcliffe Observatory, he died from cardiac failure. He was survived by his wife, a son, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Despite his considerable services to exact astronomy Stone harboured a misconception regarding mean solar time, which the reiterated arguments of professors Newcomb and John Couch Adams failed to dissipate. He determined the proper motions of 406 southern stars and, approximately, the relative masses of the components of Alpha Centauri. Almost simultaneously with William Huggins, he made in 1869 an attempt to measure stellar heat. He contributed numerous papers to the Royal Astronomical Society, including a painstaking inquiry into the origin of certain errors in the tables of the sun and moon, which was completed a month before his death.<br>
