<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ray,  Martha</span>  (1742?&#150;1779), <span class="occ">singer and murder victim</span>, was born near Covent Garden, London, probably in 1742, though some sources suggest 1745. When she was about fourteen her father, a stay maker, apprenticed her for five years to Mrs Sarah Silver, a maker of mantuas (cloaks) in Clerkenwell. At some point between 1760 and 1762 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19026/', "John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich (1718&#150;1792)")</script>, made her acquaintance through a procurer, said to be Mrs Harding, and paid Martha's father &pound;400 for &#145;the purchase of his daughter's honour&#146;, as it was put at the time of her death  (<span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span>, April 1779, 7.171), and &pound;30 p.a. thereafter to her mother. Sandwich and his wife, Dorothy Fane, had been separated at least since 1755; she experienced serious mental disorder and became a ward of the state in 1767. He and Ray had nine children, five of whom survived to adulthood, including the literary figure <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19003/', "Basil Montagu")</script>.<br>
<br>Ray and Sandwich lived in large part as husband and wife for about eighteen years. While he was known to keep a distance between her and aristocratic ladies, she served as hostess at his estate, Hinchingbrooke House, near Huntingdon, and accompanied him to London, to public engagements, and on trips to naval events. However, the earl refused her entreaties to make a settlement upon her because he wanted to live more expensively than his modest means could permit. Ray clearly contemplated leaving him, either to marry or to make a career as an opera singer. The musician Joseph Cradock reports discussing with her an attractive offer tendered her by the King's Theatre towards the end of her life.<br>
<br>Through her relationship with Sandwich, Ray received the full education appropriate to a woman of social standing. Musically she was trained by two of the most important figures of the time, the composer Felice Giardini and the conductor Joah Bates, and came to be regarded as one of the best singers of her time. She took a unique path by performing almost exclusively at Sandwich's estate or in churches in the area, seemingly never in public concerts or the theatre. The earl's concerts, especially those held during Christmas week, were performed by the best of London's musicians and drew hundreds of guests, including the powerful musical intelligentsia. Known chiefly for singing music by G. F. Handel, Ray played an important role in the process by which his oratorios, odes, and masques became established as permanent and, indeed, canonic repertory, accomplished on a scale seen for no other deceased composer before that time. Sandwich was the main leader of the movement for &#145;ancient music&#146;, founding the Catch Club (1761) and the Concert of Antient Music (1776). For her part Ray established the most prominent interpretation of Iphis's famous aria &#145;Brighter scenes I seek above&#146;, from the oratorio <span class="italic">Jephtha</span>, and her repertory included a wide range of Italian and British music.<br>
<br>Ray also participated in Sandwich's political career by dint of her being accused of colluding in his alleged corruption. As first lord of the Admiralty and one of the chief advisers to George III, he was attacked for handing out political and financial favours, especially in the naval dockyards, and it was claimed that Ray had made deals for him. Historians have since that time largely cleared the earl of these accusations.<br>
<br>In 1771 Ray met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11842/', "James Hackman")</script> when he visited Hinchingbrooke as one of the many army officers whom Sandwich invited to the estate. The two were observed together by the Tahitian prince Omai, and details of that encounter were reported to the earl; it is likely that Ray seriously considered leaving Sandwich for Hackman, since she approached Joseph Cradock to discuss the question of a settlement shortly thereafter. She did, however, distance herself from Hackman, who subsequently left the army and was ordained deacon in February 1779. His continued passion for Ray led him into what later came to be called stalking. On 7 April 1779 Ray was followed by Hackman to Covent Garden Theatre, where she was attending a performance of Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>. There she was seen talking with Lord Coleraine, whom a distraught Hackman suspected of being her new lover. On leaving the theatre she was approached by Hackman, who killed her with a gunshot to the head. Hackman then failed to take his own life in the same manner before being arrested and taken, along with Ray's body, to the Shakespeare tavern on St James Street. She was buried on 14 April in the chancel of the parish church at Elstree, Hertfordshire, and her body was later moved to the cemetery there.<br>
<br>In the ensuing press debate opinions were sharply divided over the murder, though Hackman probably drew more sympathy than Ray. Two publications, both entitled <span class="italic">Case and Memoirs of the Late Rev. Mr James Hackman</span>, argued the case from opposite perspectives, claiming either Ray's wilful duplicity or Hackman's determination to seek revenge. In 1780 the young Herbert Croft published an epistolary novel, <span class="italic">Love and Madness</span>, based on letters that he claimed were composed by the two protagonists. Unfortunately for Hackman the court had by then rejected Croft's strong suggestion of insanity and sentenced him to be hanged for murder on 19 April 1779.<br>
