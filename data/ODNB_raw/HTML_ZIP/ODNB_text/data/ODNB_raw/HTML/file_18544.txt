<span class="headword">Melville,  Andrew</span>  (1624&#150;1706), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Scotland in May 1624, the son of John Melville, minister of Newton in Edinburghshire, and grandson of the leading Presbyterian divine, and diarist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18547/', "James Melville")</script>; his mother was Joannetta Kellie, whose brother Melville was later described as chamberlain to Charles I. Sent to K&ouml;nigsberg at thirteen to study the languages of northern Europe, Melville escaped to Poland, having joined a regiment levied for Polish service, but, seeing no prospect of active employment, he returned to Scotland in 1639. There he learned that his parents, ruined by his uncle's debts, had died, and that creditors had seized the entire property. He joined the covenanter forces and served in the bishops' wars, and in England from 1644. Lord Grey of Werke, who had already taken his brother into his service, promised Andrew a cornetcy, pending which, at the head of other young men also waiting for appointments, he lived by plunder until captured by countrymen in the north of England and imprisoned for some months. On his release he accompanied the army as it withdrew to Scotland in 1647. He then went to France, served with the Scots guards in the French army in Flanders, and was seriously wounded at the siege of Lens. After a variety of adventures he waited on Charles II at Breda, and agreed to join him in Scotland. He was part of the army which entered England in 1651, and he fought at the battle of Worcester, was shot in the arm, stripped, and left for dead, but was sheltered for three months by villagers until he recovered from his wounds. He then repaired in disguise to London, and was assisted by a kinsman in escaping to Holland. After further privations and perils he joined the Scottish bodyguard of Cardinal de Retz, and served under the duke of York in French pay. Eventually he linked his fortunes with those of Count Josias Waldeck, with whom he fought for the elector of Brandenburg, the king of Sweden, the elector of Cologne, and the duke of Celle (Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg). The duke sent him to London in 1660 to compliment Charles II on his restoration, and Melville paid a second visit on his own account in 1667; but the king, while very affable, professed inability to do anything for him. In 1680&#150;81 Melville accompanied the prince of Hanover (afterwards George I) to England, and received the degree of MD at Oxford, whither he went with the prince. By 1678, retiring from active service, Melville had been appointed drost (governor or commandant) of Gifhorn with the rank of brigadier. He had married, in Germany about 1667, a Mlle Lamotte, a lady of the household of the Electress Sophia, and had a son, who predeceased him, and a daughter, Charlotte Sophia Anna (1670&#150;1724), who in 1690 became the wife of Alexander von Schulenburg-Blumberg, a Hanoverian general.<br>
<br>Melville was author of an autobiography published as <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires de Monsieur le Chevalier de Melvill</span> in Amsterdam in 1704, at the request of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, who dubbed him a &#145;soldier of <i>ill</i>-fortune&#146;. He died at Gifhorn in 1706, his career having &#145;typified the life of the mercenary soldier in the Thirty Years' War&#151;except for his survival&#146;  (Stevenson, 1&#150;2).<br>
