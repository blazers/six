<span class="headword">Ryan,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1799&#150;1875), <span class="occ">tightrope walker and circus proprietor</span>, was said to be the cousin of Charles Adams, an equestrian actor, and grandson of the circus proprietor Henry Adams. Billed as the &#145;Young Hibernian&#146;, he was seen at Birmingham in May 1815 performing on the tightrope. At Astley's Amphitheatre in London in 1822 he turned a previously unequalled number of somersaults, and in 1823 he was billed to turn forward and backward somersaults on the tightrope without the aid of a balance pole.<br>
<br>Early in 1828 Ryan's Arena was operating in Chelsea; this business on his own account succeeded, and later in that year he erected a substantial amphitheatre in Bradford Street, Birmingham, with an arena and a stage. He later had premises in Sheffield, Halifax, Bristol, and other large cities, but kept Birmingham as his headquarters. During the 1830s considerable animosity existed between Ryan and Andrew Ducrow, and Ryan opened many of his circuses in opposition to Ducrow. In 1841 he opened a brick-built circus, which led to his financial ruin, and in 1842 he was forced to sell his buildings. He continued to perform in other proprietors' arenas, and appeared as late as 1859 with Madame Macarte's circus at Stourbridge. He retired shortly after this, and for some years lived in Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham. In later years he was said to be eccentric, and was described as a short, thick-set man, of fine build and appearance. He remained healthy and vigorous, though he partly lost the sight in one eye. In 1873 he joined his daughter Susannah, a popular equestrian performer, at her home in Paris. He died there in poverty on 13 November 1875.<br>
<br>Ryan was remembered as a kind-hearted, energetic performer, with a fund of stories of circus life. At the height of his career he was a real benefactor to his equestrian performers, and was known for rewarding talent with proper remuneration.<br>
