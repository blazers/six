<span class="headword">Nabakrishna <span class="st"> [Nobkissen]</span></span>, maharaja  (<em>c.</em>1718&#150;1797), <span class="occ">political agent and adventurer</span>, rendered major services to the British in their rise to power in Bengal and reaped rich rewards as a consequence. His father was a minor official in the government of the nawabs, the Mughal rulers of Bengal, and lived in a village in the district of Murshidabad; he is believed to have taught Persian to Warren Hastings, who arrived in Calcutta in 1750, and to other servants of the East India Company.<br>
<br>Nabakrishna was appointed a <i>munshi</i>, or Persian writer, by Governor Drake in 1756. Stories abound of how he supplied the company's servants with food and information at Falta, after the sack of Calcutta by the nawab of Bengal in June of that year. He followed Colonel Robert Clive and saw the recovery of Calcutta, the capture by the British of the French settlement at Chandernagore, and the defeat and overthrow of the nawab at the battle of Plassey in 1757. After the battle the victors, led by Clive, moved to loot the nawab's treasury for the British. A Persian history records, however, that gold, silver, and jewels worth, it was rumoured, Rs 80 million (about &pound;8 million) were hidden in the harem. Nabakrishna got a substantial share of this. He was able to buy land in and around Calcutta and to win influence with the East India Company so as to become a most important citizen, building his beautiful palace at Sobha Bazar in the north of the city.<br>
<br>Nabakrishna impressed Clive with his ability and became &#145;political banian&#146;, that is Indian political agent, during Clive's second administration from 1765 to 1767 and during the administration of Harry Verelst that followed. In 1765 he obtained the title of raja and in 1766 that of maharaja from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam. He appeared as part of Clive's entourage in 1767 in the list of those whom the East India Company honoured by awarding <i>khelats</i> (ceremonial dresses). He realized that distributing patronage was necessary if he was to assume the headship of the Indian community in Bengal, and gave grants of land to important pandits and to Brahman legal scholars, who left their native places in return for lucrative stipends and grants of land which enabled them to reside close to the city. One such luminary who received Nabakrishna's patronage was the great pandit Mahamahopadhyaya Baneswar Vidyalankar.<br>
<br>Maharaja Nandakumar was Maharaja Nabakrishna's competitor for the leadership of the Indian community. Their rivalry was both bitter and all pervasive. Nandakumar was discredited after being exposed for trying unsuccessfully to induce a Brahman's wife to accuse Nabakrishna of raping her. When Nandakumar was being tried for his life in 1775 on a charge of forgery, he had the misfortune of having Nabakrishna appointed as the expert to give his opinion about the signature on a Persian document alleged to be forged.<br>
<br>Through acquiring land Nabakrishna became the <i>zamindar</i>, loosely translatable as the lord of the manor, of the Sutanati domain, which comprised the larger part of Calcutta. This brought him even closer to the British. He regularly entertained company officials at his house and gave a large piece of land for the founding of the new St John's Church in 1786. His relations with Hastings ended in a dispute about a sum of over &pound;30,000 which he claimed was a loan due for repayment, but which Hastings insisted had been a free gift. Much was made of this at Hastings's impeachment, and Nabakrishna later filed a bill in the English court of chancery, which was dismissed in 1804.<br>
<br>Adventurers like Nabakrishna made their fortunes not by trade but by taking presents, by perquisites, and by commissions on the collection of the revenue. In Nabakrishna's case, the plunder after Plassey helped to make him the richest Indian who made money out of associating with the East India Company. Like others, he spent his money on building up his position in society. He is supposed to have spent Rs 900,000 (about &pound;90,000) on his mother's funeral rites. Little is known about his personal life and character. Not having a son in spite of several marriages, he adopted his immediate brother's son, who later became Raja Gopee Mohan Deb Bahadur. Then, in the last years of his life, a son, Rajakrisna, was born to him. He died at Sobha Bazar on 22 November 1797 and was cremated. After his death a long-drawn-out lawsuit about his succession ensued.<br>
