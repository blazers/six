<span class="headword">Knight,  Thomas Andrew</span>  (1759&#150;1838), <span class="occ">horticulturist and plant physiologist</span>, was born on 12 August 1759 at Wormsley Grange, near Ludlow, Herefordshire, the younger son of Thomas Knight (1697&#150;1764), non-resident rector of Ribbesford and Bewdley, Worcestershire, and Ursula Nash (1715&#150;1798) of Bitterley, Shropshire. His father was very wealthy, having inherited a substantial income and land from the mining activities of Richard Knight (1659&#150;1745), and neither Knight nor his elder brother, the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15733/', "Richard Payne Knight")</script>, had any need to take up a profession.<br>
<br>Knight was educated at Ludlow School and briefly at a school in Chiswick, and matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 13 February 1778. Although he half-heartedly intended to enter the church, he did not take his degree, having spent most of his time as a sportsman. From about 1780 he lived with his widowed mother at Maryknowle, until 1791 when he married Frances Felton, daughter of Humphrey Felton of Woodhall, near Shrewsbury, and moved to a family estate at Elton. There his acute but untrained scientific interests emerged and he began experimenting with new varieties of fruits and vegetables. He became a successful cattle-breeder and was recommended by his brother to Sir Joseph Banks as a suitable man to return information about Herefordshire to the board of agriculture. He met Banks in 1795 and, with his encouragement, began sending articles to the Royal Society. His first papers on grafting and on the diseases of fruit trees were well received and in 1805 he was elected FRS. In 1806 he received the Copley medal for his papers on plant physiology. These early papers set out his ideas about the movement of sap in plants and the effects of gravity, moisture, and sunlight on roots and leaves. To test his ideas he devised an ingenious revolving apparatus which eliminated the effect of gravity, and which was illustrated in Davy's <span class="italic">Elements of Agricultural Chemistry</span> (1813). He believed the movements within plants to be solely mechanical.<br>
<br>Knight discovered his real vocation in the Horticultural Society. He was not one of the founder members but was brought in by Banks to draft the formal prospectus in 1804 and retrospectively declared one of the twenty-eight original members. From 1811 to his death in 1838 he was president, skilfully orchestrating the society's expansion and consolidation, including the acquisition of gardens in Hammersmith and Chiswick, new offices, a library, the introduction of exhibitions, medals, annual f&ecirc;tes, and displays, the publication of the <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, the funding and direction of overseas collectors, and a training programme for up to thirty-six young gardeners in a &#145;National School for the Propagation of Horticultural Knowledge&#146;. Public controversy over this lavish expenditure marred the end of his presidency and an anonymous pamphlet in 1829, probably by Charles Henry Bellenden Ker, which was loudly taken up by J. C. Loudon in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span>, forced an inquiry into the society's management. Knight felt his absence from London was partly to blame. Nevertheless, the society struck a medal in his honour in 1836. Knight's numerous papers in the Horticultural Society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> included studies on sap, buds, germination, bark, early varieties, forcing-houses, layering, manure, mildew, blight, and greenhouse design.<br>
<br>In 1808 or 1809 Knight moved into Downton Castle, Herefordshire, a castellated house and 10,000 acre estate built and owned by his elder brother, Richard Payne Knight, who, tired of overseeing the property, had moved to a cottage in the grounds. Making the most of this opportunity, Knight threw himself into horticultural and agricultural experiments of the highest calibre, which brought him into contact with continental physiologists such as Dutrochet, who visited Downton in 1827. Sir Humphry Davy, who included some of Knight's results in various editions of his <span class="italic">Elements of Agricultural Chemistry</span>, also visited, and praised the Downton fishing in his <span class="italic">Salmonia</span>.<br>
<br>Knight was particularly alarmed by an apparent decline in traditional varieties of fruit, considering it a matter of urgency to breed new varieties as well as to conduct scientific experiments on grafting, hybridity, fecundity, and heredity. Most of these researches were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, or the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Horticultural Society</span>, and were later collected in <span class="italic">A Selection from the Physiological and Horticultural Papers</span> (1841). Charles Darwin afterwards appreciated many of his observations.<br>
<br>Knight grew and exhibited specialist fruit and vegetables himself, earning several Horticultural Society medals. A variety of garden pea carries his name and his general observations on peas earn him a minor place in the history of genetics for adumbrating some of Mendel's results. His researches included occasional studies into animal instincts and heredity. He investigated meat production in sheep, breeding from a Merino ram given to him by George III. This work provided the basis for several publications about tithes, in which he suggested tithe value should be calculated by meat rather than corn, since the former could be produced more efficiently than the latter.<br>
<br>Knight was a whig of the old school, a lax Christian, and an engaging host. He was able to remember long sections of abstruse text and amused friends by reciting them perfectly, page after page. He had an only son, Thomas Andrew BA, who died in a family shooting accident in November 1827, and three daughters. On the death of his son the inheritance of the estates passed, not without family difficulties, from Richard Payne Knight to Thomas Knight's grandsons. The oldest daughter, Frances (1793&#150;1882), shared in Knight's experiments and married Thomas Pendarves Stackhouse Acton of Acton Scott, Shropshire; the second married Sir William Rouse Boughton; and the third, Francis Walpole. Knight died on 11 May 1838 in the London house of his daughter Frances, who wrote a short memoir after his death. He was buried at Wormsley on 22 May.<br>
