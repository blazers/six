<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Punnett,  Reginald Crundall</span>  (1875&#150;1967), <span class="occ">geneticist</span>, was born in Tonbridge on 20 June 1875, the son of George Punnett, builder and architect, and his wife, Emily Crundall. (A strawberry growing ancestor devised the wooden basket known as a &#145;punnet&#146;.) He went to Clifton College, where he was taught by W. A. Shenstone, the first schoolteacher to be elected FRS. He won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where, after years of athletic inactivity on medical advice, he became an accomplished cricketer. He obtained a second class in part one (1896) and a first in part two (1898) of the natural sciences tripos.<br>
<br>In 1898 Punnett worked for some months in Naples on the evolution of small sharks before becoming a demonstrator in the natural history department of St Andrews University. In 1901 he was elected to a fellowship at Caius. Among his colleagues there was Ronald Fisher, who was to succeed him in the chair of genetics. A common interest in cricket brought Punnett in touch with William Bateson, with whom he began to collaborate on inheritance in 1903, first in mice and later in peas, fowls, and rabbits. Bateson had already published a defence of Gregor Mendel's principles of heredity; in 1905 Punnett published his influential <span class="italic">Mendelism</span>, in both small and large versions. The book was a popular success; its sales at one time were said to compete with those of Marie Corelli. It contained &#145;Punnett's diagram&#146;, a geometric representation of the consequences of fertilization. In 1908, following discussions at the cricket nets after a lecture on Mendelism to the Royal Society of Medicine, Punnett consulted with G. H. Hardy, his fellow cricketer and co-secretary of the committee for the retention of Greek in the previous examination. The result was Hardy's law, a cornerstone of mathematical genetics.<br>
<br>Bateson and Punnett worked together for nearly seven years; they were the founders of experimental genetics in Britain, and the main exponents of Mendel's models of inheritance. Both started as marine biologists, and in Cambridge both worked on animals and plants. Each had a robust approach to mathematical exuberance, a deep respect for farmers and seedsmen, and an interest in the broader implications of Mendelism. Their joint experimental work ended when Bateson was appointed director of the newly founded John Innes Horticultural Institute in south London in 1910. In 1911 Bateson and Punnett founded the <span class="italic">Journal of Genetics</span>, which they edited jointly until Bateson's death in 1926. In 1912 Punnett was appointed to the Balfour professorship of biology at Cambridge&#151;effectively the first chair of genetics to be established anywhere&#151;after Bateson had declined it. In the same year Punnett was elected FRS.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Punnett served in the food production department of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, where he developed sex-linked plumage variants as a means of sexing chicks; this led to many of the commercial self-sexing breeds. In 1923 he published <span class="italic">Heredity in Poultry</span>, and produced a map of the X chromosome of the chicken.<br>
<br>In 1913 Punnett married a widow, Eveline Maude Froude Nutcombe-Quicke (<i>d</i>. 1965), daughter of John Froude Bellew of Stockleigh English, Devon; they had no children. After his marriage Punnett diverted his formidable athletic activities from cricket to tennis. In 1943 he retired to Somerset, where he maintained his wide interests, which included Japanese prints, Chinese porcelain, biologists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and wine: he retained a personal cellar at Caius, which he visited annually. At seventy-four he published humorous verse in Latin. He died on 3 January 1967 while playing bridge at his home, Bilbrook Lodge, Bilbrook, Washford, near Minehead in Somerset.<br>
