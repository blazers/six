<span class="headword">Osler,  Edward</span>  (1798&#150;1863), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and writer</span>, born at Falmouth, Cornwall, on 30 January 1798, was the eldest son of Edward Osler (<i>d</i>. 1832) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Paddy, master of a packet at Falmouth. She died in April 1864, aged ninety-one. Their son's early education was conducted by a Baptist minister, and as Osler was intended for the medical profession he was apprenticed to Carvosso, a surgeon at Falmouth, and trained at Guy's Hospital, subsequently qualifying in 1818 as MRCS. From about 1819 to 1825 he held the appointment of resident house surgeon at the Swansea Infirmary, and was also surgeon to the Swansea house of industry. At Swansea parish church, in February 1821, he married Jennette Powell, the daughter of a local architect. She died at Swansea about 1828, leaving a daughter and a son. During his residence in Swansea Osler became a great friend of Lewis Weston Dillwyn, and consequently enjoyed the advantage of a scientific library. Through his friend Osler was able to send two valuable papers on marine biology to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1826 and 1832. He was duly elected a fellow of the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>Osler became a surgeon in the navy and visited the West Indies, writing during the passage and his term of duty there the poem &#145;The Voyage&#146;, published in 1830, as well as some papers on natural history. Although raised as a dissenter, Osler became a member of the Church of England, and on his return to England became associated with Prebendary William John Hall, editor of the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, in the production of <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns Adapted to the Services of the Church of England</span> (1836), generally known in its later issues as the <span class="italic">Mitre Hymn-Book</span>. He contributed to this collection fifteen versions of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and fifty hymns, some of both sections being adapted from previous authors. He also published various other works on ecclesiastical subjects, and these were consolidated in <span class="italic">Church and King</span>, published in periodical form in 1836&#150;7.<br>
<br>About this period in his life Osler was on the staff in London and Bath of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, but was also taking a deep interest in secular matters. His most important publication, the <span class="italic">Life of Admiral Viscount Exmouth</span>, came out in 1835, and he drew up a small treatise, the &#145;Administration and improvement of the poor laws&#146;, which was published by the poor-law commission as an appendix to its report.<br>
<br>In 1837 Osler married, at Gluvias, Cornwall, his second wife, Sarah Atkinson of Leeds, and a few years later, about 1841, he was called to Truro in Cornwall as editor of the <span class="italic">Royal Cornwall Gazette</span>, the leading Conservative journal in the county, and remained in that position until his death. Several articles contributed by him to its columns, such as the &#145;Packet question: Falmouth or Southampton&#146; and &#145;History of the Cornwall Railway&#146;, were reissued in a separate form. Osler's second wife died at Truro on 31 January 1842, aged thirty-seven, leaving four children. His third wife was Charlotte Free, niece and adopted daughter of Captain Brilton of Stralton Place, Falmouth. Her death occurred at Truro on 19 January 1868; she left no children. Osler died at the Parade, Truro, on 7 March 1863, and was buried at Kenwyn. One of the smaller painted-glass windows in the chancel of that church was erected by his friends to his memory. He was survived by a son and two daughters from his second marriage, his other three children having predeceased him.<br>
