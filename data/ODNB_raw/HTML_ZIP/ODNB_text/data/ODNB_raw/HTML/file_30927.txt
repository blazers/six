<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Christie,  John Traill</span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">headmaster and college head</span>, was born at Chipping Ongar, Essex, on 19 October 1899, the fourth son (there were no daughters) of Charles Henry Fehler Christie JP, stockbroker and deputy lieutenant, and his wife, Margaret Eleanor, daughter of the Revd Charles Samuel Palmer, canon of Hereford. He was educated at Winchester College and (after a brief period in the Coldstream Guards, in which he was a second lieutenant in 1918) at Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained firsts in classical honour moderations (1920) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1922). His vocation had become clear before he took finals, and in that same year he accepted an invitation from W. W. Vaughan to teach classics to the upper bench at Rugby. &#145;I enjoy teaching more and more,&#146; he wrote, &#145;I wouldn't be a don.&#146; But he very soon became known as a fine teacher and scholar and in 1928 was persuaded to go back to Oxford as fellow and tutor in classics at Magdalen.<br>
<br>In 1932 Christie was appointed headmaster of Repton, and in the following year he married Lucie Catherine (1901&#150;1996), only daughter of Thomas Philip Le Fanu, commissioner of public works in Ireland, and a nephew of the Irish novelist J. S. Le Fanu. There were two daughters of the marriage. In 1937 he succeeded H. Costley-White as headmaster of Westminster. Two years later the life of the school was violently disturbed by the war. The government, and everyone else, was convinced that London would be bombed, and in 1938 plans were already being made for schools to be evacuated from the danger area. When the code signal &#145;Pied Piper&#146; was sent out by the government, Christie led his staff and boys down to Sussex, where Lancing and Hurstpierpoint contrived to accommodate them. Nine months later, when a German invasion of the channel coast was expected, they had to move again. Christie eventually settled his flock in makeshift quarters in and near Bromyard, and there they stayed until the end of the war. To keep the school in good heart and true to its educational ideals demanded unusual powers of leadership, and the headmaster was never at less than full stretch. The return to London in 1945 brought fresh problems, for the school buildings had been severely damaged and in part destroyed in the air raids. In 1946, worn out at last by his unceasing labours, Christie went down with a severe illness and was out of action for some months. He spent three more strenuous years at Westminster, but in 1950 he welcomed the opportunity to return to Oxford as principal of Jesus College, succeeding his old friend Sir Frederick Ogilvie.<br>
<br>It was not the Oxford Christie had known twenty years earlier. He watched ruefully the encroachment of administration on the time that surely belonged by rights to study and teaching. But he was a dutiful man, and only a recurrence of ill health stopped him from offering to shoulder the burden of the vice-chancellorship when his turn came in 1960. He retired in 1967.<br>
<br>Christie's advice in educational matters was widely sought. He went to India with the commission on secondary education appointed by the Indian ministry of education (1952&#150;3) and himself wrote the report, and in 1956 he undertook for the British Council an inspection of schools throughout South America to report on the suitability of the teachers sent out by the council. He served on the governing bodies of Rugby, Haileybury, Glenalmond, and Brecon, and was the first governor of the Dragon School at Oxford.<br>
<br>Christie was an entertaining speaker and an impressive preacher, but he was, above all, a teacher. He excelled in poetry, especially, perhaps, Sophocles and Shakespeare, but he enjoyed all literature. He was a lifelong admirer and champion of Sir Walter Scott and was president of the Walter Scott Society in 1953. Messrs Collins engaged him to write the introductions to a new edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels launched by them in 1955, but only three volumes were published.<br>
<br>Christie was a tall spare man with a normally serious, almost stern expression which was shaken easily into deep laughter. He was strong and active as a young man, something of a rock climber, and a redoubtable walker. He welcomed a companion but was happy to walk <i>solus</i>. It was not everyone that could keep up with him. He died on 8 September 1980 at Sudbury. He was buried in the parish churchyard of Great Henny, Suffolk, where he and his wife had bought a country cottage many years earlier.<br>
