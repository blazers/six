<span class="headword">Gracedieu, Sir  Bartholomew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1715), <span class="occ">merchant and colonial agent</span>, was the son of Thomas Gracedieu (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1679), &#145;citizen and dyer&#146; of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London. In September 1671 he was apprenticed to Thomas Collet, a salter by trade and a member of the Vintners' Company. He became a freeman of London in 1679, and, although he found considerable success as an overseas merchant, he appears to have maintained an interest in salting. His master's influence also extended to his choice of domicile, since he became a long-term resident of Collet's parish, St Magnus the Martyr. By 1692 he had married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1720), with whom he had at least three children, including two daughters.<br>
<br>By March 1686 Gracedieu had entered the trade to Jamaica, thereby consolidating his family's connections with the island&#151;his brother Daniel having resided there in 1678. He dealt extensively in sugar, indigo, and logwood, the colony's main exports, and also invested in shipowning. By 1692 the council of Jamaica was prepared to use him for the remittance of its payments to England, and his standing with the planters and merchants of the island led to his eventual appointment as official agent, a role in which he served from 1693 to 1704.<br>
<br>Gracedieu's prominence in the capital was clearly a recommendation for such office. He was a notable figure in the nonconformist community, having been appointed as one of the managers of the Presbyterian Fund in 1690, and he later became a member of the New England Company, which maintained strong links with London dissenters. Despite his religious beliefs he made rapid strides in political circles, serving as a common councillor for Bridge ward in 1693, and being chosen a City lieutenant in 1694. The following year his income was assessed at more than &pound;600 per annum, and his commercial prominence was recognized by the government in 1696, when he was nominated as one of the commissioners for taking subscriptions to the ill-fated land bank. In June 1697 he was elected sheriff, and in that capacity attended the king to offer the City's congratulations on the signing of the treaty of Ryswick. Such was the king's gratitude that Gracedieu and his fellow sheriff were knighted in the royal bedchamber at Kensington. In 1698 he assumed the mastership of the Vintners' Company, but his hopes for greater civic status went unfulfilled, for he lost an aldermanic election at Bridge ward in June 1700 &#145;by a majority of three to one&#146; against the tory Charles Duncombe  (Luttrell, 4.651). This defeat did not blunt his political ambition, and in July 1701 he helped to stage a City welcome for the Kentish petitioners, who had embarrassed the ministry by urging parliament to pursue a more aggressive policy against the French.<br>
<br>Gracedieu's fear of French aggrandizement may well have been animated by his interest in Jamaican affairs, especially as the island was perceived to be vulnerable in the wake of a series of natural catastrophes. Indeed, in 1701&#150;2 Gracedieu headed the cartel which undertook the remittance of payments for the island's newly strengthened garrison. With the advent of renewed Anglo-French conflict, he campaigned hard for more efficient convoys and better fortifications to protect the island and its trade, with some success. However, in these fraught times he even managed to fall out with fellow agent and vintner Sir Gilbert Heathcote, when a major controversy arose concerning a proposed removal of trade from Port Royal to Kingston. Gracedieu and his allies feared this innovation would weaken the island even further, and after much acrimony their arguments prevailed to save Port Royal.<br>
<br>Gracedieu's status was further enhanced in 1705 when he was returned to parliament for the Cornish borough of St Ives. Although trading connections may have recommended his candidacy, he could not boast any obvious association with the town or its electoral patrons. Nevertheless, he performed very strongly, topping the poll. Given his nonconformist credentials, it is unsurprising that he was subsequently regarded as a supporter of the whig ministry, and backed the administration in divisions concerning the election of the speaker and the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. He proved an inactive member, although in July 1706 he presented an address on behalf of his constituents to the queen in recognition of the victory at Ramillies. His unspectacular Westminster career ended in 1708 when he chose not to seek re-election, a decision perhaps influenced by the financial problems which bedevilled his last years.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from parliament Gracedieu limited his public role to colonial affairs. In 1709 he lent his support to a campaign for the settlement of impoverished palatine refugees in Jamaica, an issue which again stirred up divisions between rival island interests. Thereafter he even ceased to figure in the West Indian theatre, an anonymity which can be attributed to business difficulties, it being reported in January 1710 that &#145;Sir B&#151;&#151; Grace&#151;&#151;, a great merchant in the City, has stopped payments&#146;  (newsletter, 19 Jan 1710, BL, Add. MS 70421). The precise cause of his commercial downfall is unclear, although he had suffered the misfortune of losing a ship to privateers in 1699, and as recently as 1707 he had complained of the inadequate protection afforded to colonial shipping. Electioneering expenses may also have further stretched his personal resources. One contemporary simply described him as &#145;broke&#146;, and by early February 1710 a commission of bankruptcy had been served against him  (<span class="italic">Le Neve's Pedigrees of the Knights</span>, 459). Such penury effectively undermined his public career, and it is probably significant that as early as 1708 he had ceased to play an active role on the vestry of St Magnus the Martyr. Although a spent political force, he remained true to his party, voting for the four whig candidates at the bitter London election of 1710.<br>
<br>The exact date of Gracedieu's death has not been ascertained, but doubtless occurred shortly before 30 March 1715, when his body was &#145;carried away&#146; from the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, in preparation for burial in the nonconformist cemetery at Bunhill Fields on 3 April  (Guildhall Library, MS 6673/6). Letters of administration over his estate were granted to his widow, Lady Frances, who in turn was succeeded in 1720 by the couple's only surviving daughter, Eleanor. Both mother and daughter were interred at Bunhill.<br>
