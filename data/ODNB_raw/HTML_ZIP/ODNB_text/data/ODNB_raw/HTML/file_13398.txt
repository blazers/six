<span class="headword">Hampden,  Augustus Charles  Hobart-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Hobart Pasha]</span>  (1822&#150;1886), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Walton on the Wolds, Leicestershire, on 1 April 1822, the third son and fourth child of Augustus Edward Hobart, from August 1878 Hobart-Hampden, sixth earl of Buckinghamshire (1793&#150;1885), and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1825), daughter of John Williams, king's serjeant, and sister to the judge Sir Edward Vaughan Williams; his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13397/', "Vere Henry Hobart")</script>, achieved prominence as governor of Madras. Augustus went to Dr Mayo's school at Cheam, Surrey, but did not distinguish himself, and in 1835 he entered the Royal Navy, joining the <i>Rover</i> (18 guns) at Devonport in February. The <i>Rover</i> was paid off at Plymouth in July 1838, and Hobart joined the <i>Rose</i> in October, became acting mate in July 1841, and, when paid off in July 1842, passed his examinations at the Naval College and on board the <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth. He qualified as gunnery mate, and joined the <i>Dolphin</i> in the autumn of 1843. His first three ships were all employed off the coast of South America in the suppression of the slave trade. He captured a slaver and took her to Demerara in May 1844. He afterwards returned to England, and was appointed to the royal steam yacht the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> (Captain Lord Adolphus Fitz Clarence). In September 1845 he was promoted lieutenant and joined the pioneer screw steam sloop <i>Rattler</i> in the Mediterranean, and was transferred in 1847 to the <i>Bulldog</i> (Commander Key), where he showed himself &#145;full of zeal&#146;  (W. Parker, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3, 1880, 323). In 1848 he married Mary Anne, second daughter of Dr Colquhoun Grant; she died on 13 April 1877.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Russian war Hobart served as first lieutenant on the same vessel in the Baltic squadron, and commanded the <i>Driver</i> for a fortnight (August 1854) at the capture of Bomarsund and the reconnaissance at &Aring;bo (Turk&uuml;). His ship was commended in dispatches, and Hobart's &#145;ability, zeal, and great exertion&#146; at &Aring;bo were specially mentioned. In 1855 he served aboard the <i>Duke of Wellington</i>, Admiral Dundas's flagship, and commanded the mortar boats at the attack on Sveaborg (Helsinki), for which he was again mentioned in dispatches and was promoted commander. Then for six years he left the regular service of the navy and became officer of the coastguard at Dingle, co. Kerry, and subsequently (1858&#150;61) of the guardship at Malta. In 1861 he commanded the gun-vessel <i>Foxhound</i> in the Mediterranean, was promoted captain in March 1863, and immediately retired on half pay.<br>
<br>In spite of his family &#145;interest&#146;, Hobart's rise had been very slow, reflecting his lack of discipline and incompatibility with the rules of subordination. He retired in the middle of the American Civil War, and as a staunch southerner, joined some brother officers in running the blockade off North Carolina. His daring and skilful seamanship, the exciting chases and narrow escapes, when Hobart was in his proper element, are described in <span class="italic">Never Caught</span> (1867), which he wrote under the pseudonym of Captain Roberts, and which is practically reprinted in <span class="italic">Sketches of my Life</span> (pp. 87&#150;186). American authorities stated that this was substantially accurate  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 337).<br>
<br>In 1867, seeking a new career of adventure, Hobart entered the Turkish service as naval adviser to the sultan, in succession to Admiral Sir Adolphus Slade. His first task was the suppression of the Cretan rebellion by intercepting supplies from Greece. For his successes here he was raised to the rank of full admiral, with the title of pasha (1869). The Turkish fleet was reorganized and improved under his direction, but in the war of 1877 the jealousy of the authorities prevented him, as commander of the Black Sea Fleet, from achieving any notable naval success, though he displayed considerable skill in defeating attacks by Russian torpedoes, a weapon he despised. In 1881 the sultan appointed him mushir or marshal of the empire. Hobart's action against Greece in 1867 breached the <span class="roman">Foreign Enlistment Act</span>, so he was struck off the British navy list. Restored to his naval rank in 1874 by Lord Derby's influence, he was again struck off in 1877 for his command of the Black Sea Fleet, but was finally restored in June 1885, with the rank of British vice-admiral. On 5 May 1879 he married Edith Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Herbert Francis Hore of Pole Hore, co. Wexford, who edited his <span class="italic">Sketches</span>. In 1885 he visited London with a view to forming an offensive alliance between England and Turkey at the time of the Panjdeh incident. In 1886 he went to Italy to recover his health, but died at Milan on 19 June.<br>
<br>Hobart-Hampden's <span class="italic">Sketches of my Life</span> was published posthumously in 1887. John Laughton, in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (January 1887, no. 337), demonstrated that he unaccountably confused dates and places, and claimed the exploits of brother officers. Hobart-Hampden was a brave and resourceful junior, but lacked the discipline and reflection for a successful career in the peacetime Royal Navy.<br>
