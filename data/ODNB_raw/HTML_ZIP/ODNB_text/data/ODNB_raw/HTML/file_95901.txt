<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tripp,  William John Charles Spencer <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1922&#150;2005), <span class="occ">comedian and pantomime artist</span>, was born in Plymouth on 4 February 1922, the only son of William Tripp, baker, and his wife, Lilian. He had two sisters. His family had no theatrical connections, but they loved music hall and attended the Plymouth Palace Theatre every Monday night, where dancing acts were the young Jack's favourites. He initially had no particular comedic aspirations although at three years old he amused a party by mimicking Felix the cat. He attended tap dancing classes with his sisters and won the Espinosa award with the previously unheard of mark of 100 per cent, subsequently appearing in local clubs as &#145;Plymouth's Fred Astaire&#146;. He attended school locally, at Plymouth public secondary school.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Tripp served with the Royal Electrical Engineers, but claimed never to have mastered the assembling of a Bren gun. He was soon co-opted into directing his first forces revue, <span class="italic">That's the Spirit</span>, and discovered his remarkable talent for mimetic comedy&#151;as well as dancing&#151;in skits including a one-man take-off of the popular music hall act Wilson, Keppel, and Betty. He joined the Stars in Battledress unit and performed in Europe and the Middle East (in Cairo and Khartoum).<br>
<br>It was while appearing in a Stars in Battledress production that Tripp was discovered by the agent of the great comedian Sid Field, whom he understudied in <span class="italic">Piccadilly Hayride</span> (1946). He watched Field at work over 100 times and learned from him the gift of audience rapport, taking in the whole house with na&iuml;ve complicitous eyes. In 1947 he was booked for the celebrated <span class="italic">Half Past Eight Show</span> in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Ayr, alongside Beryl Reid and the Scottish comedians Dave Willis and Harry Gordon. From these shows he was chosen as principal comic for the Fol-de-Rols, the acclaimed concert party. Greatrex Newman, the producer, wrote clever sketches and lyrics: Tripp modestly said that he didn't always understand the words he was singing but Newman praised him, saying &#145;Jack always brings something extra&#146;  (private information). He stayed with the Fols for fourteen years, becoming a particular summer favourite on the south coast. He performed sketches by Robert Dhery, the French comedian, Dhery and Jacques Tati being special favourites. In 1955 he appeared at the Adelphi in London in the revue <span class="italic">Such is Life</span>, with Al Read and Shirley Bassey. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, his own revue, <span class="italic">Take a Tripp</span>, appeared regularly at various south coast resorts each summer.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a successful parallel career had developed, in pantomime. Tripp started as second comic to such &#145;Mothers&#146; as Douglas Byng who taught him how to &#145;attack&#146; a part. He was a hilarious Johnny in <span class="italic">Mother Goose</span> at the Oxford New Theatre in 1954, performing his ballerina and rebellious recruit sketches. He first played a dame&#151;the part for which he became best known&#151;in 1959, at the Alhambra in Glasgow, subsequently playing the part thirty-five times. So popular was he with panto managements that he only worked for four&#151;Howard and Wyndham, Derek Salberg (for fourteen years), Duncan Weldon (for twelve years), and Paul Elliot. They always wanted him back, knowing he could save the show even if their starring television celebrity proved inadequate. Salberg called Tripp &#145;my insurance policy&#146;  (private information). His pantomime career culminated in outstanding appearances as Nurse Ribena in <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> (Sadlers Wells, 1994&#150;5) and a spectacular Mother Goose (Plymouth, 1995&#150;6). In 1996 he was made an MBE for services to pantomime. His last appearance was as Lord Brockhurst in Sandy Wilson's 1930s pastiche <span class="italic">Divorce Me Darling</span> (Chichester, 1997). In other hands this elderly rou&eacute; part could have lent itself to vulgarity: Tripp brought to it the innocent charm that pervaded all his work.<br>
<br>Small and stylish, with twinkling eyes and feet, Tripp was a comic through and through. His face, with its inquiring nose and wide mouth&#151;changing in a flash from broad grin to purse-lipped pathos&#151;was an open invitation to laughter, as was his voice, a husky drawl with an inbuilt chortle. In visual comedy his timing was perfection. As dame he was dainty and demure&#151;as immaculately clean as his starched gingham outfits; he never relied on funny costumes for a laugh. Without a trace of effeminacy he managed to suggest a sprightly female character as well as a gentle children's playmate. His favourite pantomime foil was Roy Hudd who wrote and directed all Tripp's later Christmas shows. Hudd understood Tripp's talents perfectly, regarding him as &#145;the best Dame there is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Herald</span> [Plymouth], 2 Jan 2004), a view shared by Tripp's peers.<br>
<br>Off stage Tripp was full of <i>joie de vivre</i> and humour, rejoicing in life's absurdities. A loyal and generous friend, he was always ready to offer shrewd professional advice. Despite his sunny temperament he could be keenly critical, especially of bad manners and conceit in fellow artistes, while never losing his sense of the ridiculous. He and his longstanding on- and off-stage partner, Allen Christie, were outstanding hosts in their sumptuous flat in Wilbury Road, Hove. He died on 10 July 2005 in the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, of acute pneumonia. He was survived by a nephew, Paul Andrews, Allen Christie having predeceased him. A service of celebration and thanksgiving was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 28 October 2005.<br>
