<span class="headword">Maitland,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1693&#150;1757), <span class="occ">historian and topographer</span>, was born at Brechin, Forfarshire. Nothing is known of his parentage or of his education. He is known first as a hair merchant, an occupation that took him to Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, and which seems to have enabled him to devote himself to historical study. By 1733 he was in London, working on a history of the city; writing to Richard Richardson on 7 August 1733, Sir Hans Sloane refers to the work in progress. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 12 April 1733 and on 13 March 1735 he became a member of the Society of Antiquaries. In April 1737 he appears to have started publishing his history of London in shilling numbers, but only one was announced. About 1738 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> a response to an essay by W. Kersseboom about the population of London. In 1739 he published by subscription his <span class="italic">History of London, from its Foundation by the Romans to the Present Time</span>, in a folio edition printed by Samuel Richardson. A strongly whiggish history, it was dedicated to the king; the prince of Wales's copy is in the British Library. The work, which owed much to predecessors such as John Stow and John Strype, was not universally well received. In a letter to Joseph Ames dated 1 July 1740 Maitland responds cantankerously to the suggestion that the work was &#145;not worth keeping&#146;, and abuses Ames for his failure to win subscribers. He goes on to declare that since the work has &#145;met with the approbation of the most judicious and best judges, I despise what others say of it, considering it is not in their power to do me an injury in the sale thereof, seeing I have not one copy left&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.383).<br>
<br>In the same year Maitland resigned from the Society of Antiquaries and returned to Scotland, where he remained, apart from a six-week stay at Bath for the recovery of his health in the autumn of 1750. He began studying the history of Scotland and proposed to write a general topographical description of it. To this end he prepared a &#145;large set of queries, with a general letter, and transmitted both to every clergyman in Scotland&#146;, but &#145;the return fell so very far short of his expectation, that he laid aside his design in disgust&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.383). Some returns from this anticipation of Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span> are mentioned in Gough's <span class="italic">British Topography</span>. Meanwhile Maitland prepared a folio <span class="italic">History of Edinburgh, from its Foundation to the Present Time</span> (1753), dedicated to the prince of Wales, and based on a fairly thorough examination of the city's archives. This was a work of &#145;very great labour&#146; which contained much valuable information, though &#145;the style is mean, and the whole tone of the work is that of a plain, dull old man&#146;  (Chambers, Scots., 3.563). A second edition of the <span class="italic">History of London</span>, extended into two folio volumes, with help from others and by the addition of many more plates, followed in 1756. (Further editions appeared in 1760, 1769, 1772, and 1775, the last continued and expanded by the Revd John Entick.) Maitland resumed his work on Scottish topography by making a tour of the country himself. The results appeared in volume 1 of his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Scotland</span>, published in two folio volumes after his death at Montrose on 16 July 1757. This last work, though it &#145;did credit to his industry, seems to have been judged deficient in the erudition and critical sagacity requisite for such a design&#146;  (Aikin, 6.489). Later it was said to be &#145;absolutely destitute of reputation&#146;  (Chambers, Scots., 3.563). His general reputation within a few years of his death was low. Richard Gough says he was &#145;self-conceited, credulous, knew little, and wrote worse&#146;  (Gough, 2.572). According to Aikin, &#145;this author has no pretensions to rank among literary characters of the superior class, either in point of style or depth of reflection&#146;  (Aikin, 6.489). The <span class="italic">History of London</span> is, however, still referred to by historians. Early newspaper accounts indicate that he died &#145;at advanced age&#146; but sixty-four seems to be a reliable consensus  (Chalmers, 21.169). He did not marry, and was said to have died worth &pound;10,000.<br>
