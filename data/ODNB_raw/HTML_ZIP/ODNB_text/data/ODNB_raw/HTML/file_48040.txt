<span class="headword">Carden, Sir  Robert Walter</span>, first baronet  (1801&#150;1888), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, was born in London on 7 October 1801, the youngest son of James Carden (1758&#150;1829), a barrister, of Bedford Square, London, and Richmond, Surrey, and his wife, Mary (1765&#150;1830), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28636/', "John Walter")</script>, founder of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a newspaper in which her son Robert retained a proprietary interest. One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59472/', "George Frederick Carden")</script>, cemetery founder. In 1816 he took a commission in the 52nd foot and in 1822 he began a sixty-five year association with the stock exchange, becoming the &#145;father of the house&#146; and remaining active until his death. He married Pamela Elizabeth Edith (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of William Smith Andrews of the 19th foot, in 1827; they had ten children.<br>
<br>In 1855 Carden founded the City Bank, incorporated by royal charter. It became a limited company in March 1880. By 1898 the bank had opened twenty-one branches in London and its suburbs, and had amalgamated with the London City and Midland Bank Ltd. It was renamed the London Joint City and Midland Bank in 1918 and the Midland Bank in 1923, with its headquarters in Threadneedle Street. Although he was thought of as a pillar of the City (he was also a chairman of the Royal Exchange Bank and director of the Canada Company), Carden's aspirations were relatively modest. Politically, however, his influence continued to grow. His connection with the City's Dowgate ward began in 1849, when he became, in an uncontested election, its alderman, and continued until he retired to the ward of Bridge Without in 1871. He was a commissioner for the lieutenancy of London in 1849. The following year, in December 1850, he made the first of many attempts to enter parliament, on this occasion at St Albans. It was here that, although unsuccessful, he gained his reputation for forthrightness by fighting widespread corruption in the constituency. Besides sitting for Gloucester from April 1857 to May 1859 and Barnstaple from April 1880 to 1885, he also contested Marylebone in April 1861, Reading in November 1868, and Barnstaple in February 1880.<br>
<br>Carden had more success in his municipal career and brought to it the same direct approach. After serving as a sheriff in 1850&#150;51 and receiving a knighthood on 17 July 1851, he was noted as the proposer of the Indian Mutiny Fund, and he made a visit to Russia on the occasion of the coronation of Tsar Alexander II. He was lord mayor of London in 1857&#150;8. Again, he refused to accede to bribery and corruption, this time from within the common council. Consequently, on his return to the common hall of the livery companies he was received with hooting and groans. During his mayoral year his unpopularity deepened. He was the first to abandon the water procession of the lord mayor's show and to concede the City's rights over the Thames to the Thames Conservancy Board. More crucially, however, he was seen as a &#145;sturdy&#146; evangelical conservative (he attended services at Portman Chapel, under the ministry of the Revd Neville Sherbrooke) in a city that maintained its Liberal and whig mix  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>, 21 Jan 1888).<br>
<br>His year as lord mayor was also one in which Carden widened his scope for public service, becoming a JP for Middlesex and Surrey. As a magistrate, he confined City vagrants for three weeks at a time and as a result the streets were said to have been cleared of a nuisance. At a public meeting he promised to find work for all the unemployed present, but he complained subsequently that few remained working for more than a month, and only two for a year. His experience as a teacher in the Ogle Mission, Gray's Yard ragged school, and at George Yard, Whitechapel, all institutions to which he contributed financially, also gave him a close knowledge of the unemployed. Every three years, he opened his Surrey residence, Mole Lodge in West Moulsey, to the children of the High Street Mission, thus revealing a personality that could be alternately generous and stern.<br>
<br>The death of his wife in 1874, a year after the death of his second son Robert, a clergyman of the Church of England, seemed to temper his outlook. In 1876&#150;7 he undertook his third spell as master of the Cutlers' Company, this time in more favourable circumstances. In June 1887 he was rewarded with a baronetcy. He was discovered dead in his chair after dinner on 19 January 1888 at his home at 64 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London. He was buried at Kensal Green, in the cemetery which his brother George had founded. According to one obituary he was remembered as &#145;frosty but kindly&#146;  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>, 21 Jan 1888), the qualities that he had shown during a life that spanned almost the whole of the nineteenth century.<br>
