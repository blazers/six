<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Broadhurst, Sir  Edward Tootal</span>, baronet  (1858&#150;1922), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer</span>, was born on 19 August 1858 at Bury Old Road, Broughton, near Manchester, the second son of Henry Tootal Broadhurst (1822&#150;1896), cotton manufacturer, and his first wife, Mary Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brooks. He attended Dr Hungerford's Eagle House School at Wimbledon, and Winchester College, and joined the family firm in 1876. Charlotte Jane (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), the youngest daughter of the prominent Hyde cotton manufacturer Thomas Ashton, became Broadhurst's wife on 18 June 1887. They had no children.<br>
<br>Edward Tootal Broadhurst was a third-generation cotton manufacturer. Such men, particularly those with experience of Winchester or other &eacute;lite establishments, are often accused of preferring the grouse moor to the counting house. It cannot be denied that Broadhurst shot grouse and lived in a manor house, but he was also a conscientious worker who took good care of his fortune.<br>
<br>Broadhurst's father, together with Henry and Joseph Lee, and Robert Scott, were business partners who later formed a limited company, Tootal Broadhurst Lee (Tootals). Tootals was a vertically integrated firm, combining spinning and power-loom weaving, at a time when there was a tendency for firms to specialize in a single process. A further distinctive feature was Tootals's marketing network, including offices and warehouses in Bradford, Belfast, and Paris, and agencies further afield. Tootals employed about 5000 workers in 1887, and operated 172,000 spindles and 3500 looms, making it the third largest vertically integrated cotton firm in Lancashire.<br>
<br>Broadhurst's main responsibility during the 1880s and 1890s was for the financial side of the business, leaving management of the mills to Harold Lee, son of Henry Lee. The 1890s were difficult times for the cotton industry because of growing overseas competition. Chairmanship of the finance committee passed to Broadhurst in 1900, and he represented the firm on the board of the British Northrop Loom Company, which made advanced American &#145;automatic&#146; looms, and on the council of the British Cotton Growing Association. Improved trade boosted the firm's profits in the early 1900s. Following a weavers' strike, Broadhurst replaced Harold Lee as chairman of the company in 1907, but retained a conciliatory style and continued to work from a very modest office. His strategy was to concentrate production in the best mills: Sunnyside at Bolton, and Ten Acres and Hemming Works near Manchester. Sunnyside was converted from steam to electric power in 1912, and two new weaving sheds were built. The First World War, and the boom of 1918&#150;20, brought Tootals even higher profits.<br>
<br>In 1919, the market value of Tootals's shares was &pound;1,700,000. Using this measure, Tootals ranked fourteenth among textile producers in the UK, and one hundred and fifteenth among all British industrial enterprises. Tootals was among the top ten firms in the Lancashire cotton industry, although it was much smaller than the largest combines, such as the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association, which had been created by merger at the end of the Victorian period. It would be fair to say that, under Broadhurst's leadership, the company held its own by the standards of the time.<br>
<br>Broadhurst was a moderately important political figure in Lancashire, especially in the Manchester North West constituency. He was president of the Prestwich Conservative Association. During the 1900s, as an ardent free-trader, he found himself at odds with the protectionist stance of the Conservative Party. Broadhurst believed that the introduction of a tariff would be disastrous, because other countries would retaliate against Britain's export industries, including cotton. Broadhurst chaired Manchester's Free Trade League, and the Manchester Free Trade Unionist Association, and was a member of the Unionist Free Trade Club. In 1906 he defied his party in order to campaign for the Liberal candidate in Manchester North West, Winston Churchill. Broadhurst chaired an election meeting for Churchill, and gave him a rousing introduction: &#145;For Free Trade or against it! There is no halfway house for timid retaliators to shelter in&#146;  (Churchill, 116). He served as high sheriff of Lancashire in 1906&#150;7. At the 1908 election he supported Churchill again, and was one of the &#145;Mugwump Millionaires&#146; abused by the Conservative candidate for betraying the party. Declining to allow his name to be put forward as a rebel Conservative candidate in 1908, Broadhurst began to realize that the next election would be about more than free trade versus protection. He deplored the radicalism of Lloyd George and the new Liberals, and feared that they would reduce the country to socialism, or worse. At the first 1910 election Broadhurst promised to vote conservative, but could not bring himself to take an active part in the campaign. Between 1910 and 1912 Broadhurst suffered lengthy bouts of nervous illness.<br>
<br>In 1914 Broadhurst and other businessmen formed a committee which raised the Manchester City battalions (Manchester Pals), a volunteer formation including staff from offices, warehouses, and mills. He contributed &pound;1000 to the cost of equipment and uniforms. In 1917 he was appointed to the Cotton Control Board, which rationed the dwindling supply of cotton by placing restrictions on the operation of machinery. Firms working on government orders were given permission to run more machinery for longer hours. Tootals was caught red-handed in October 1918, working flat out on normal civilian orders, while claiming to be engaged on war contracts.<br>
<br>Despite this violation, Broadhurst received a baronetcy for his war work in 1918. An Anglican by persuasion, he was involved in the usual round of good works: he was president of an orphan school, a governor of the Whitworth Institute, chairman of the Manchester and Salford Lifeboat Fund, and member of the council of Manchester University. He sat on committees to find work for ex-servicemen after the war, and gave Manchester some playing fields, as a thank-offering for victory and a tribute to Manchester's contribution to the war.<br>
<br>Broadhurst's home was the Manor House, North Rode, Congleton, in rural Cheshire; he died of cancer at 9 Hyde Terrace, Leeds, on 2 February 1922. He was survived by his wife.<br>
