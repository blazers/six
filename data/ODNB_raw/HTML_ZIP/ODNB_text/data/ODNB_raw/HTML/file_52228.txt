<span class="headword">Whittingham, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1452), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was perhaps the eldest of the four children of Alan Whittingham, who may have been a Londoner; more certainly, he was the nephew of Robert Whittingham, a rich London tailor, and the brother of Thomas, another tailor. Whittingham was established in London as a draper by 1407 and inherited city property from his uncle in 1413. He rose through trade in woad and pepper as well as wool, through links with Italians and deals with city magnates. By 1419 he could afford to pledge &pound;20, the second largest amount, for the new Drapers' Hall. Elected MP for London and warden of his livery in 1416, he was alderman of Bishopsgate ward (1417&#150;22) and of Walbrook ward (1422&#150;38). He served as auditor of London in 1418&#150;19 and 1424&#150;5, and was sheriff in 1419&#150;20, but never became mayor. In the 1420s Whittingham's service with John, duke of Bedford, brother of Henry V and regent of France, took him away from city politics and onto the national stage.<br>
<br>By 1420 Whittingham had married Agnes, daughter of Richard and Joan Buckland. Buckland was treasurer and victualler of Calais (1421&#150;36) and a councillor of Bedford. This connection no doubt led to Whittingham's appointment as Bedford's receiver-general in England by December 1426. He oversaw Bedford's great English estates and profits of office as admiral of England. He also shipped supplies, weapons, victuals, and wine, to the regent in France. His adherence to Bedford, and to the regent's uncle, Cardinal Henry Beaufort, was probably the cause of the reported anger of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, Bedford's younger brother and political opponent, following a meeting of the court of aldermen in May 1427.<br>
<br>In 1432 Bedford granted Whittingham a substantial annuity (&pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) on the manor of Salden, Buckinghamshire, and also the advowson of St Stephen Walbrook, Whittingham's London parish church. From 1433 to 1439 Whittingham was receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall, another key source of Bedford's income. On his deathbed in 1435 Bedford appointed Whittingham an executor. Although he closed accounts as receiver-general of Bedford's former lands in England, Calais, and the Channel Islands in 1438, Whittingham was involved in Bedford's complicated estate for the rest of his life. From 1438, under Beaufort's direction, he collected tallies and paid creditors, recording his efficient administration in a &#145;boke of declaracion&#146;, which survives. Whittingham was trustee of the estates of other magnates, such as Beaufort, Henry, Lord Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1483), and John Holland, duke of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1446), for whom he also served as executor, and acted as banker to such veterans of the French wars as Bedford's chamberlain, Sir Andrew Ogard. According to William Worcester, Ogard left with Whittingham a chest with about 7000 marks in &#145;French gold&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1436 Whittingham succeeded Richard Buckland as treasurer of Calais and master of the Calais mint. At this critical time for Calais he embarked on a series of loans to the crown, none exceeding &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., which were repaid in full by 1446. A seasoned wool exporter, he arbitrated in at least one dispute between the mayor and merchants of the Calais staple. By 1439 he was himself mayor of the staple and was present in the Star Chamber when a fellow draper was convicted of concealing wool exports. His Calais responsibilities led to his appointment as ambassador to Flanders and Brabant, Holland and Zeeland, Burgundy and France, on a series of missions in 1438&#150;41. He attended the Anglo-French peace negotiations in 1439, and in 1440&#150;41 the negotiations surrounding the release of the duke of Orl&eacute;ans. Whittingham seems to have represented the mercantile interest, and to have worked for the resumption of Anglo-Flemish trade. He was treasurer of Calais until late December 1441, when a scandal erupted over the town's buildings and defences; Whittingham and his father-in-law were accused of neglect and of misappropriating bricks and timber. Whittingham was threatened with a suit in the exchequer court, but it was deferred from term to term.<br>
<br>Whittingham had acquired his main London house in Walbrook in 1418. With purchases in 1437 and 1447 he came to own most of the east side of Walbrook, backed by a large garden. Besides investing in London property in at least three other London parishes, Whittingham became a country gentleman with five or more manors and other lands and reversions in Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Berkshire. He served on many commissions, and was sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1433&#150;4 and 1438&#150;9. It is not known when he bought his main manor of Pendley in Hertfordshire, but it was probably before 1432, when he sat as MP for the county. Whittingham enclosed a park of 200 acres at Pendley in 1440 and built a chapel there by 1442. The date he acquired the neighbouring manor of Maudeleyns in Northchurch, where his uncle had established a chantry in 1413, is also unknown. Whittingham obtained two-thirds of Bedford's former manor of Salden in 1439 through the good offices of Cardinal Beaufort; he recovered it swiftly after the <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span> of 1450. Other properties he owned in Buckinghamshire included the manor of Moulsoe. He bequeathed Donnington manor in Berkshire to his eldest son.<br>
<br>At Whittingham's death on 4 or 5 November 1452 he left life interests in his house in Walbrook and in Salden to his widow, along with the lion's share of his chattels, including all those at Pendley, and divided his other manors, lands, and chattels among his four sons. He elected to be buried at Ashridge Priory, Hertfordshire, which had a special connection with the duchy of Cornwall. Obits were kept for him and for his widow, who died in 1456. In 1575&#150;6 his Verney descendants moved the Whittingham double tomb to the Pendley chapel in the church of St John the Baptist, Aldbury, Hertfordshire, where it survives. A drawing of <i>c</i>.1600 shows the lost armorial glass in the south choir window of St Stephen Walbrook, where Whittingham had laid the third foundation stone of the new building in 1429. It depicts Whittingham's arms: party per fess argent and or a fess vert, overall a lion rampant gules, combined with the arms of Bedford, his principal patron, the ostrich plumes of Lancaster, the arms of England, and the Buckland arms of his wife. His eldest son, another Sir Robert, killed at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, has often been confused with his father.<br>
