<span class="headword">Maguire,  Thomas</span>  (1831&#150;1889), <span class="occ">classical scholar and philosopher</span>, was born in Dublin on 24 January 1831, the son of Thomas Maguire, a Roman Catholic merchant, subsequently stipendiary magistrate in Mauritius. After attending a school in Dublin, at the age of fifteen Maguire went with his family to the colony, but returned to enter Trinity College, Dublin, in 1851. He obtained a sizarship, but being a Roman Catholic he could not hold a scholarship or fellowship. He gained high honours in classics and metaphysics, including the Wray prize in the latter (1853), and the Berkeley medal in Greek literature and composition (1857). In 1855 he graduated BA as senior moderator in classics and in philosophy. In the same year the board of Trinity College endowed non-foundation scholarships for the relief of those labouring under religious disabilities. Maguire competed, and was elected. In 1861 he obtained the law studentship at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1862 was called to the English bar. Although highly commended by Lord Westbury, he soon ceased to practise, and, returning to Dublin about 1866, set up as a private teacher in Trinity College. In 1868 he was presented by the college with the degree of LLD, the payment of the usual fees being remitted as a mark of favour. In 1869 the chair of Latin in Queen's College, Galway, became vacant, and Maguire was appointed to it. In 1873 <span class="roman">Fawcett's Act</span> for the removal of religious disabilities in Trinity College and the University of Dublin was passed, and Maguire at once prepared to compete for a fellowship.<br>
<br>Maguire was elected the first Roman Catholic fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, on Trinity Monday, 24 May 1880, being then forty-nine years and four months old. His accession to the fellowship was hailed with universal rejoicing. He was personally known to all the fellows and to most of the students who had passed through the college since 1851. He was held in high esteem for the courtesy of his manners, and was socially a charming companion. A special chair of classical composition was immediately created for him, and in 1882 he vacated this to take the professorship of moral philosophy. Although no active politician, Maguire took some part in the transfer to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of the Pigott letters, which were published by <span class="italic">The Times</span> in a series of articles called &#145;Parnellism and crime&#146; in 1887 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22255/', "Pigott, Richard")</script>], and he went to London early in 1889 to give evidence before the commission appointed by parliament to inquire into the truth of the statements made in those articles. He was fully convinced of the authenticity of the Pigott letters, but died, apparently unmarried, at Eaton Place, London, on 26 February 1889 before his examination in court took place. He was buried on 2 March in Dean's Grange, Dublin.<br>
<br>Maguire was a thorough idealist in philosophy, Plato and Berkeley being his chosen masters. He published sets of essays on Plato in 1866 and 1870, an edition of Plato's <span class="italic">Parmenides</span> in 1882, and a set of philosophical lectures in 1885. He contributed largely to <span class="italic">Hermathena</span> and <span class="italic">Kottabos</span>, and many of his translations in the latter appeared in the volume of <span class="italic">Dublin Translations</span> edited by Professor R. Y. Tyrrell.<br>
