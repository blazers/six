<span class="headword">Mairet,  Philippe Auguste</span>  (1886&#150;1975), <span class="occ">draughtsman and critic</span>, was born at 12 Blythwood Road, Islington, London, on 27 April 1886, the second youngest of five sons and two daughters of Charles Sylvain Mairet (1840/41&#150;1907), a watchmaker of Swiss nationality, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldsmith, originally from Thames Ditton, in Surrey. Mairet attended the local board school, and then the Stationers' Company's School in Hornsey. He entered Hornsey School of Art in January 1901, where he trained for four years. His first job was as a draughtsman and designer for the celebrated architect and social reformer C. R. Ashbee as part of the Guild of Handicraft in the Cotswold town of Chipping Campden. Both socially and intellectually his time in this community was the equivalent of the university years from which he felt his lower middle-class background had excluded him.<br>
<br>The guild introduced Mairet to the ideas of the arts and crafts movement. It was also here that he met Ethel Mary Coomaraswamy (1872&#150;1952) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39639/', "Mairet, Ethel Mary")</script>], wife of the art historian A. K. Coomaraswamy, for whom Mairet worked as a secretary in 1910. After the breakdown of her first marriage Ethel and Philippe fell in love and married on 28 May 1913. They spent their early married years in a thatched cottage in Shottery, near Stratford upon Avon, where Ethel had a weaving business (she was later to become one of the central figures in the revival of hand-weaving in Britain). In the same period Philippe worked for Burlison and Grylls, a firm of stained glass window makers on Great Ormond Street, where he helped design one of the windows for Sir Gilbert Scott's Anglican cathedral in Liverpool.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1914 Mairet met Dimitrije Mitrinovi&#263; (1887&#150;1953), a Serbian philosopher and mystic who was working for the Serbian legation in London. By his own admission Mairet invested Mitrinovi&#263; with the &#145;aura of the sage or prophet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, 86). Mairet also worked briefly as assistant to the social evolutionist Patrick Geddes while Geddes was doing a vacation course of lectures with Gilbert Slater at King's College, London. Mairet joined the Red Cross in 1915, but at the end of 1917 was persuaded to resign and become Mitrinovi&#263;'s full-time collaborator and disciple to spread the gospel of &#145;pan-humanism&#146;. Partly to escape detection by the military authorities for avoiding conscription, Mairet moved to the utopian agrarian community at Ditchling in Sussex, where he met Douglas Pepler and Eric Gill and published <span class="italic">An Essay on Crafts and Obedience</span> (1918). He was eventually discovered by the authorities, arrested, enrolled in the Royal Sussex regiment, court-martialled, and imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs, partly in solitary confinement. He was released at Whitsuntide 1919.<br>
<br>Between 1922 and 1926 Mairet was an actor at the Old Vic, where he used the stage name Henry Cohen. He played numerous parts including the Bishop of Ely in <span class="italic">Henry V</span> and Sir Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. He also continued his work for Mitrinovi&#263; in this period and met the Viennese psychologist Alfred Adler in 1926. Mairet wrote <span class="italic">ABC of Adler's Psychology</span> (1928) and helped found the British branch of the International Society for Individual Psychology in order to publicize Adler's ideas. Mairet was involved with Mitrinovi&#263;'s New Europe group, which operated from the same building at 55 Gower Street, London. As part of the group's activities Mairet claimed to have written the first manifesto calling for the political union of Europe  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, 138), which Passerini  (p. 127) has identified as <span class="italic">Integration of Europe: the Way to Reconstitute the States of Europe as an Organic Society in a New World Order</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Throughout the inter-war years Mairet gained an increasing reputation as a cultural critic and commentator. He was a founding member of the Chandos group, which had originated in a meeting called by Mitrinovi&#263; on 12 May 1926 and took its name from the restaurant at the lower end of St Martin's Lane. This group became known as a forum for Christian cultural criticism, attended by T. S. Eliot and others. Mairet commented on the drafts of Eliot's <span class="italic">Notes Towards the Definition of Culture</span> (1948), which Eliot later dedicated to Mairet &#145;in gratitude and admiration&#146;. Mairet later remarked to C. H. Sisson that he would be remembered for the books dedicated to him rather than for those he had written himself  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, xvi).<br>
<br>In early 1932 Mairet eventually freed himself from Mitrinovi&#263;'s influence, in what he described as the &#145;complete destruction of my previous way of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, 174). His marriage to Ethel broke down at the same time, partly due to his affair with Gwendoline Norsworthy, who was involved with the New Handworker's Gallery which Mairet had opened in Percy Square, London, in 1927. Mairet described this affair as a &#145;second marriage&#146;, but it was one, in his words, that took place &#145;without benefit of law or clergy&#146;  (ibid., xix).<br>
<br>Philip (he Anglicized his name in the 1930s) Mairet's writing, publishing, and editing activities came increasingly to the fore. He had been a contributor to Alfred Orage's influential cultural review, the <span class="italic">New Age</span>, from 1919. Later, when Orage acquired the <span class="italic">New English Weekly</span> in 1932, Mairet became his assistant. On Orage's death in 1934 Mairet took over the editorship of the journal, a position he held until 1949. The <span class="italic">New English Weekly</span> became an organ for the ideas of the Chandos group and a supporter of C. H. Douglas's theory of social credit. Mairet's review was also important in giving publicity to the nascent ideas of the organic food movement, an interest which he continued after the Second World War as a member of the Soil Association.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1943 Mairet was received into the Anglican communion by the bishop of Willesden at St Silas's, Kentish Town, where Mairet was later to become a churchwarden. He claimed that the drift towards the Church of England had dominated his thoughts for the previous twenty years  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, xxi). He edited the Anglican journal <span class="italic">Frontier</span> with Alec Vidler; contributed to Maurice Reckitt's journal <span class="italic">Christendom</span>; and described his allegiances later in life as &#145;Anglican and Royalist&#146;. Nevertheless, in his later years Mairet's activities and interests remained extraordinarily varied: he continued his work of publicizing Adlerian psychology and produced English translations of Emmanuel Mounier (<span class="italic">Personalism</span>, 1952) and Jean-Paul Sartre (<span class="italic">Existentialism and Humanism</span>, 1948). Indeed it is the bewildering variety of Mairet's interests throughout his life that has limited his posthumous reputation. A mild and self-effacing man, he was above all an interpreter and publicist of the ideas of others, from C. R. Ashbee and Patrick Geddes (on whom he wrote <span class="italic">Pioneer of Sociology</span> in 1957) to Mitrinovi&#263;, Adler, and Eliot. As such he was at the forefront of some of the most interesting spiritual and sociological ideas of the twentieth century and, according to his friend Maurice Reckitt, &#145;could not fail to be a notable influence in any company&#146;  (Reckitt, 191&#150;2).<br>
<br>Mairet had a stammer throughout his life, and in his later years was short and slight with a bald head and longish grey hair at the back and sides. Owen Barfield and C. H. Sisson both described his appearance&#151;in the friendliest possible way&#151;as &#145;frog-like&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical and Other Papers</span>, x). Latterly resident at 23 St Swithin's Terrace, Lewes, Sussex, he had a stroke at the age of eighty-six, and died at a nursing home in Seaford, Sussex, on 9 February 1975.<br>
