<span class="headword">Preston,  William</span>  (1750&#150;1807), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born in the parish of St Michan's, Dublin, the only son of William Preston, gentleman, who went to India when his son was two years old and was never heard of again. Preston obtained his early education at Dr Campbell's school in Dublin and was admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1765. He graduated BA in 1770 and MA in 1773. He entered the Middle Temple in 1775 and was called to the Irish bar in 1777. He assisted in the formation of the Royal Irish Academy, was elected its first secretary in 1786, and was a frequent contributor to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. He wrote occasional verse for various periodicals but a collection of his verse in 1781 proved abortive when the printer went bankrupt. He turned his attention to drama about 1790, and in the space of four years he wrote six plays, predominantly in verse. His chief success in this field was his tragedy <span class="italic">Democratic Rage</span> (founded on incidents in the French Revolution), which was produced at Dublin in 1793, and in printed form ran through three editions in as many weeks.<br>
<br>In 1793 Preston published a two-volume collection of his verse and plays, with the exception of <span class="italic">Democratic Rage</span>, already published separately. A further posthumous collection of his verse was published by his widow in 1809. Although he had no small opinion of his abilities as a poet and dramatist, and fancied himself as something of a literary savant wasting his time among &#145;an unlettered people&#146;  (&#145;Preface&#146;, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1793), in the final analysis posterity has judged him a minor talent.<br>
<br>During the late 1770s and the 1780s Preston was a supporter of Lord Charlemont and the volunteer movement. It was around this time too that he was initiated into the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96301', "Monks of the Screw")</script>, a patriot club that endured until the mid-1790s. These political connections gained him early legal preferment when, in 1784, he was appointed a commissioner of appeals, but further advancement on the bench eluded him. In the 1790s he evinced some sympathy with the ideals of the United Irishmen, for he contributed verse to <span class="italic">The Press</span>, the journal of that organization, but without apparently becoming a member. He is also believed to have favoured Catholic emancipation.<br>
<br>In 1789 Preston married Frances Dorothea Evans, a daughter of John Evans, who succeeded as the fifth Baron Carbery in 1804; they had seven children. Preston had another son, William, who could not have been the result of his marriage to Frances Evans, for he was killed, aged twenty, at the battle of Delhi in India in 1803. This William was either Preston's natural son or the issue of an earlier marriage, the details of which have not been uncovered.<br>
<br>Preston died in Gloucester Street, Dublin, on 2 February 1807 of miliary fever said to have been brought on by sitting all day in court in wet clothes. He was buried in St Thomas's churchyard, Marlborough Street, Dublin, but during the 1920s a new street was built on the site of this graveyard and in the process Preston's remains were exhumed, with those of some 3500 others, and reinterred in Mount Jerome cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin.<br>
