<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Thompson]</span>,  Elizabeth Southerden</span>, Lady Butler  (1846&#150;1933), <span class="occ">military painter</span>, was born on 3 November 1846 at Villa Claremont, Lausanne, Switzerland, the elder daughter of Thomas James Thompson (1812&#150;1881) and his second wife, Christiana Weller (1825&#150;1910). Unusually, her education and that of her sister, the poet and essayist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35008/', "Alice Meynell (1847&#150;1922)")</script>, was not entrusted to a governess but was undertaken by her father, a man of independent means and artistic leanings. After spending much of her childhood in Italy, she began receiving professional art training in 1862 and entered the Female School of Art, South Kensington, London, in 1866; she supplemented her studies there with attendance at a private &#145;undraped female&#146; life class which enabled her to draw figures with confidence in her later work as a battle painter. In 1869 the family moved to Florence and converted to Roman Catholicism. Her first notable work, <span class="italic">The Magnificat</span> (1872; St Wilfrid's Church, Ventnor), was of a religious subject.<br>
<br>On a visit to Paris in 1870 Elizabeth Thompson found her true m&eacute;tier when she encountered the new, more realistic portrayal of battle being pioneered by painters such as Edouard Detaille and Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier. Her first successful Royal Academy submission, <span class="italic">Missing</span> (exh. 1873)&#151;a scene of the suffering of ordinary soldiers in the aftermath of a battle in the Franco&#150;Prussian War&#151;was an exercise in this manner. The next year, the lessons she had learned in France were applied to a British military subject, <span class="italic">Calling the Roll after an Engagement, Crimea</span> (exh. RA, 1874; Royal Collection). &#145;The Roll Call&#146;, as it quickly became known, proved to be one of the most popular paintings of the nineteenth century: at the academy, a policeman had to be stationed in front of it for its protection. The painting was subsequently taken on a highly successful solo tour of a number of provincial cities, and engravings of the work and carte-de-visite photographs of the artist&#151;looking young and pretty, completely contrary to what the public would expect a successful battle painter to be like&#151;were sold by the thousand.<br>
<br>During the next few years Elizabeth Thompson exhibited a series of scenes from the Crimean and Napoleonic wars, which were similar in character and composition to &#145;The Roll Call&#146; with individualized but anonymous soldiers arranged across the canvas and the minutiae of dress and equipment recorded with the utmost accuracy. These works, <span class="italic">The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras</span> (exh. RA, 1875; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), <span class="italic">Balaclava</span> (exh. Fine Art Society, London, 1876; Manchester City Galleries), and <span class="italic">The Return from Inkerman</span> (exh. Fine Art Society, London, 1877; Ferens Art Gallery, Hull) were also immensely popular. Much was made of the unprecedented sympathy for the suffering and heroism of the ordinary British soldier which they seemed to display, a quality which was deemed especially remarkable because she had never witnessed war at first hand, but explicable in view of her sex; she was a &#145;Florence Nightingale of the brush&#146; as someone commented. Nevertheless, with hindsight one can see that these works also benefited from the interest in the plight of the less fortunate in society, which was a feature of contemporary art in the 1870s.<br>
<br>In 1879 the success of these works brought Thompson within two votes of election as associate of the Royal Academy, the nearest any woman came to receiving such an honour in the nineteenth century. However, this proved to be the summit of her career. She never again stood for election at the academy, perhaps sensing that the reformist climate of the 1870s, which had seen the academy almost countenance a female associate member, had passed. Subsequently, only <span class="italic">Scotland for Ever!</span> (exh. Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London, 1881; Leeds City Art Gallery), today her best-known painting, enjoyed the kind of acclaim her previous work had received. An important reason for this sudden slump in her popularity was undoubtedly her marriage on 11 June 1877 to an up-and-coming army officer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32219/', "Sir William Francis Butler (1838&#150;1910)")</script>. This brought in its train the duties of child-rearing (she had five children) and the requirement to travel to distant parts of the globe. It also encouraged her to continue with her bleak, untriumphalist approach when tackling subjects drawn from contemporary colonial wars at a time when public taste was for scenes of imperial conquest. Because of his Catholic Irish background William Butler became increasingly critical of Britain's &#145;imperial mission&#146; and appears to have encouraged her to refrain from glorying in the defeat of ill-equipped native troops in works such as <span class="italic">The Defence of Rorke's Drift, January 22nd, 1879</span> (exh. RA, 1880); Royal Collection) and <span class="italic">&#145;After the Battle&#146;: arrival of Lord Wolseley and staff at the bridge of Tel-el-Kebir at the close of action</span> (exh. RA, 1885; priv. coll.). By contrast, rival battle painters such as Richard Caton Woodville, Charles Fripp, and William Barnes Wollen&#151;all of whom had learned from her successes of the mid-1870s&#151;felt no qualms about catering to popular taste.<br>
<br>Although Lady Butler continued to paint until 1929 her work was largely ignored&#151;except for a period in the 1890s when she enjoyed something of a revival with Napoleonic subjects such as <span class="italic">Dawn of Waterloo: the &#145;Reveille&#146; in the Bivouac of the Scots Greys on the Morning of Battle</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1895; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">&#145;Steady the Drums and Fifes!&#146;: the 57th (Die-Hards) Drawn up under Fire on the Ridge at Albuera</span> (exh. RA, 1897; the Queen's regiment, Canterbury). It was not that the character of her work had fundamentally changed, for she continued to celebrate the stoicism of the ordinary British soldier in adversity and danger just as she had half a century before. It was more that as a response to the conditions of modern warfare, particularly those of the First World War, her kind of battle painting now seemed old-fashioned and inappropriate. She died at her residence, Gormanston Castle, co. Meath, Ireland, on 2 October 1933.<br>
<br>Lady Butler has a dual claim to fame. She pioneered a new, more realistic depiction of warfare in British painting, one which was to prove immensely influential at the end of the nineteenth century. And she briefly enjoyed critical and popular success of such magnitude that, for a while, it seemed a new era for women artists in Britain was about to dawn.<br>
