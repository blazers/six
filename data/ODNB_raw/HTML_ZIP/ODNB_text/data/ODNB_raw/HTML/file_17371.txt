<span class="headword">McCabe,  William Putnam</span>  (<em>c.</em>1776&#150;1821), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and cotton manufacturer</span>, was born in Belfast, the third of four children of Thomas McCabe (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;1820), watchmaker, cotton manufacturer, and United Irishman, and his first wife, Jean Woolsey (<i>d</i>. June 1790), daughter of John Woolsey, merchant of Portadown. His middle name, Putnam, derived from a distant relative who served under George Washington. He was educated in Belfast, specializing in mechanics and drawing, before working in his father's mill. Being somewhat unruly as a young man, he was sent to train in Glasgow and Manchester in the hope that this would have a maturing effect. After returning to Belfast he joined the Society of United Irishmen and was employed as an emissary by the Belfast committee, being sent to Connaught in late 1796. McCabe travelled around Ireland, organizing civilian societies into military units.<br>
<br>An excellent mimic, McCabe adopted various Irish and Scottish dialects to conceal his identity from the authorities. He took great care to avoid arrest, but his reputation was such that a price of &pound;500 was placed on his head. A description was circulated thus: &#145;height five foot four inches: well made: walks smart: full face: black or dark eyes: dark hair: whiskers: good complexion: not corpulent but pretty lusty: a great deal of vivacity: wears pantaloons and boots&#146;  (McCabe, 17). McCabe's escapes from capture are legendary. Arrested in Dublin in May 1798, he persuaded his Dumbarton fencible guards that he was an innocent Scot, wrongly apprehended while out for a stroll. So convinced were they by his accent that he was released. On another occasion McCabe evaded capture by fooling his pursuers into thinking that he had escaped through his open bedroom window when, in fact, he had hidden under the mattress.<br>
<br>McCabe was aide-de-camp to the rebel commander-in-chief Lord Edward Fitzgerald. His role in the rising is, however, unclear. Some accounts place him at Naas and Kildare before he joined the belated French invasion force under Humbert, which landed in the west in August 1798. The insurrection crushed, McCabe returned to Dublin, thence to Wales and Scotland. He travelled regularly between Dublin, London, Hamburg, and Paris, continuing his intrigue on behalf of the United Irishmen by, for example, conspiring with the United Britons and Colonel Edward Despard in 1802. In 1801 at Christ Church, Southwark, London, he married Elizabeth McNeil, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lockhart (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1806), widow of Captain Alexander McNeil of the 8th light dragoons, and sister of Sir Alexander McDonald Lockhart of Lee, Scotland. According to a copy of the marriage record, McCabe was married as &#145;William Lee, of Manchester&#146;  (<span class="roman">Pallot's Marriage Index</span>). The couple moved that year to Paris and forcibly took with them Elizabeth's ward, Louisa Neville, who remained in France until about 1811 and later married the Canadian politician Thomas Chandler Haliburton, William and Elizabeth had one daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1802).<br>
<br>McCabe subsequently established a cotton business near Rouen, where he received a gift of 4000 francs from Napoleon, who visited the factory. There McCabe is said to have helped train Irish &eacute;migr&eacute;s for Robert Emmet's 1803 uprising. Upon selling his mill at Rouen, he loaned money to the United Irishman Arthur O'Connor, whose failure to repay the debt led to protracted court battles, in both France and Ireland. McCabe returned to Ireland regularly between 1810 and 1814 to pursue his claims, but was arrested in 1814, only to be freed by order of the chief secretary, Robert Peel, on condition that he leave Ireland. On returning again in 1817 he was arrested and sent to Kilmainham gaol, Dublin, where he languished for eighteen months. At the end of 1818 he returned to France, but was detained again in Glasgow the following year.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life McCabe was infirm with rheumatism. He died in Paris on 6 January 1821 and was buried at the Vaugirard cemetery in Paris. His daughter, Elizabeth, married Andrew Nesbitt of co. Meath two weeks after McCabe's death. Nesbitt promptly spent the several thousand pounds left by McCabe to his daughter, and when he died in 1839 Elizabeth and her children were left destitute.<br>
