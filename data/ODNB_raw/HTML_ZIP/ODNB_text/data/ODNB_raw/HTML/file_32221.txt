<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butt, Dame  Clara Ellen</span>  (1872&#150;1936), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 1 February 1872 at 4 Adur Terrace, Southwick, Sussex, the eldest daughter and eldest surviving child of Henry Butt, a captain in the mercantile marine, and his wife, Clara Hook, great-granddaughter of Theodore Hook. Both her parents sang and they encouraged Clara to cultivate her voice, which early showed the richness and compass for which she was to become renowned as a contralto. When her parents moved to Bristol in 1880, the headmistress of South Bristol high school, a Miss Cook, heard her pupil's low notes and asked the bass Daniel Rootham, conductor of the Bristol festival chorus, to hear her. He set about training her voice and enrolled her in his chorus. In January 1890, when she was almost eighteen, she won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where she studied with John Henry Blower.<br>
<br>Clara Butt's scholarship was extended for a fourth year. The college sent her to study for three months in Paris with V. A. Duvernoy, the cost being met by Queen Victoria, who had heard of the student's talent through the prince of Wales, then patron of the college. Later in her career Clara Butt studied with the baritone Jacques Bruhy in Paris, with the soprano Etelka Gerster in Berlin, and in Italy. She made her professional d&eacute;but in the Royal Albert Hall, London, as Ursula in Sir Arthur Sullivan's <span class="italic">The Golden Legend</span> on 7 December 1892. Three days later she sang the title role in Gluck's <span class="italic">Orfeo</span> when it was staged at the Lyceum Theatre by students of the Royal College of Music. Bernard Shaw wrote in <span class="italic">The World</span> that she &#145;far surpassed the utmost expectations that could reasonably be entertained&#146;  (Shaw, 14 Dec 1892).<br>
<br>Clara Butt's reputation was soon made, and she became what today would be called &#145;the flavour of the month&#146;, no doubt aided by her imposing presence on the platform&#151;she was 6 feet 2 inches in height. Less than a year after the appearance in <span class="italic">Orfeo</span>, Shaw reviewed a Royal Choral Society performance of Handel's <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span> conducted by Sir Joseph Barnby at which he singled out Clara Butt's singing of &#145;Their land brought forth frogs&#146; as magnificent, adding, &#145;the last fourteen bars came with the true musical and dramatic passion which reduces all purely technical criticism to a mere matter of detail&#146;  (Shaw, 29 Nov 1893). After this she was in demand at all the principal festivals and by 1898 was living in London in a flat in Hyde Park Mansions. There, in January 1899, the composer Edward Elgar called on her with a song cycle he had sketched for the forthcoming Norwich Festival. She was in her bath at the time and instructed her woman companion to send him away. Elgar complained to her manager (N. Vert), and a few days later he was received with more warmth. The result was <span class="italic">Sea Pictures</span>, for contralto and orchestra, of which she gave the first performance at Norwich on 5 October 1899 with the composer conducting. Elgar's host at Norwich, James Mottram, described her &#145;wonderful dress, the material of which, it was whispered, indicated appropriately the scales of a mermaid's sinuous form&#146;  (Mottram, 253). Two days later she sang four of the five songs (with piano accompaniment by Elgar) at St James's Hall in London. Elgar was thrilled with her performance, and there is evidence in his correspondence with A. J. Jaeger, of Novellos, to support her claim in later years that he wrote the part of the Angel in <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span> with her voice in mind. Nevertheless, for whatever reason, she did not sing in the first performance of that work at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900, although she sang in <span class="italic">Sea Pictures</span> on the previous evening at the festival. (She recorded some extracts from <span class="italic">Gerontius</span> in April 1916.)<br>
<br>In 1900 Clara Butt married the baritone singer Robert Kennerley Rumford (1870&#150;1957), with whom thereafter she gave many highly successful and lucrative concerts, mainly of popular ballads, in Britain and the United States and throughout what was then the British empire. But one of the two songs with which she was most closely associated was by Elgar. Sitting next to him on 26 November 1901 at a concert at which the first two <span class="italic">Pomp and Circumstance</span> marches were played, after listening to the trio melody of no. 1 she asked him to &#145;write something like it for me&#146;. After a &#145;little talk and persuasion on my part, you said &#147;You shall have that one, my dear&#148;&#146;  (Clara Butt to Edward Elgar, Elgar birthplace archive, Broadheath). Elgar was planning an opulent final movement for the coronation ode he was writing for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. A. C. Benson provided the text for this, beginning with the words &#145;Land of hope and glory&#146;. As soon as Booseys, the publishers, saw the score, they recognized its potential as a solo song and asked Elgar to revise it accordingly. With slightly different words from those in the ode, Clara Butt sang it for the first time at a concert in the Royal Albert Hall on 24 June 1902. The king's appendicitis postponed his coronation until October, so the ode was not performed until the Sheffield Festival on 2 October 1902 and in London three weeks later. Clara Butt sang in neither performance. The other great tune which she made virtually her own was &#145;Abide with me&#146;, closely followed in the Butt popularity stakes by &#145;O rest in the Lord&#146; from Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span>.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Clara Butt was indefatigable in her energy and generosity in organizing concerts for charity and singing in them. Outstanding among these occasions was that from 8 to 13 May 1916, when she sang in six successive performances of <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>, raising &pound;2700 for the Red Cross. In publicity before the performances, the first of which was attended by King George V and Queen Mary, it was announced that Clara Butt believed there was a new attitude towards death. Many of those without faith before the war, she argued, were now hungering to believe that there was life beyond the grave. For her wartime work she was appointed DBE in 1920. This was the year in which she made only her second appearance on the opera stage, when she again sang Gluck's <span class="italic">Orfeo</span>&#151;this time at Covent Garden with Sir Thomas Beecham conducting.<br>
<br>Clara Butt made many gramophone records, too many of them of the potboilers with which she and her husband filled their recitals. The warm-heartedness of her singing later came to be thought excessive, but undoubtedly it met the taste of the time. Her audiences were thrilled by the booming, trombone-like strength of the tone and by the unashamed emotional portamentos which she imported into her singing. Her voluminous performance of &#145;Land of hope and glory&#146; has become almost a caricature of an era, but this should not render listeners deaf to its sincerity and noble solemnity. A recording made in September 1920 of &#145;Where corals lie&#146; from <span class="italic">Sea Pictures</span> is an example of the lightness of touch she could command, and explains why the composer valued her artistry so highly in his works, when managements could afford her high fees.<br>
<br>Clara Butt knew tragedy in her private life. She and Rumford had two sons and a daughter; both sons predeceased her. From 1901 to 1929 the Rumfords lived at 7 Harley Road, Hampstead, after which they moved to Brooke Lodge, North Stoke, Oxfordshire. In 1931 she had an accident which led, after a painful illness, to her death at North Lodge, North Stoke, on 23 January 1936, three days after King George V.<br>
