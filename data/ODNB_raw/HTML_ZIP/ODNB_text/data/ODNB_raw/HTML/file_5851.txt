<span class="headword">Cole,  Henry</span>  (1504/5&#150;1579/80), <span class="occ">dean of St Paul's and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Godshill, Isle of Wight. He entered Winchester College in 1519 at the age of fourteen, and was admitted to New College, Oxford, on 26 October 1521, becoming a fellow exactly two years later, and retaining his fellowship until 1540. Cole took his BCL on 3 March 1530 and was incepted as DCL in July 1540. In the interval he studied law in Padua and perhaps Greek. Although Cole's formal patron was Dr William Knight he became close enough to Reginald Pole to have known about the latter's <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span>, a fierce attack on Henry VIII which was completed in 1536, and told Thomas Starkey that Pole had changed his mind about papal authority while writing it. Cole accompanied Pole on his first (abortive) legation towards England in 1537 before they parted company in Paris. Returning to England, Cole became sub-warden of New College in March 1538, and, more importantly, by April had written a treatise on general councils defending Henry VIII's attack on the council of Mantua&#150;Vicenza of 1537&#150;8. Cole argued that the pope was not head of the council, that not even a council could determine things indifferent, and concluded that it would be easier &#145;to make a new head than to reform the old&#146;  (BL, Hatfield MS 46, fol. 75<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Cole's first major benefice was Pole's old prebend of Yetminster secunda in Salisbury Cathedral (installed 30 September 1539), and he was collated to the rectory of Chelmsford, Essex, on 11 September 1540 (vacated by March 1548). Three prebends of St Paul's in succession followed: Holborn (1540&#150;41); Sneating (1541 to before 22 March 1542); and Wenlocksbarn (1542 to 29 May 1559). Also in 1540 Cole was admitted to the College of Advocates. On 25 March 1542 he was ordained priest and on 4 October was elected warden of New College. He was the bishop of London's chancellor by 1543 at the time of the prebendaries' plot against Archbishop Cranmer, who suspected Cole of involvement in it. In early December Cole was arrested on the grounds of his association with Reginald Pole, now a cardinal, who had been attainted with other members of his family in 1539, but was pardoned on 24 April 1544 for all dealings with Pole and with the latter's agent, Michael Throckmorton. The pardon granted to one John Bekinsaw on 6 May following stated that Cole had sent Pole medicine and arranged a secret signal with Bekinsaw to let him know what happened to Pole following his departure from Flanders, presumably in 1537. Stephen Vaughan's report in January 1545 that Cole had been seen in Italy on his way to Rome cannot be accurate, since on 4 July following he personally surrendered a property of his college to the king, but it is of a piece with the attack on Cole as a popish traitor, &#145;one of Poolys ryght scolars&#146;, made by Vaughan's colleague Henry Brinklow in his <span class="italic">Complaynt of Roderyck Mors</span>  (<span class="italic">Brinklow's Complaynt</span>, 61).<br>
<br>New College presented Cole to the rectory of Newton Longville on 16 May 1545 (vacated 1552), although he was not installed until three days after he had been dispensed on 11 September to hold an additional benefice. In 1550 the sub-warden and fellows tried to oust Cole, and were ordered in October not to proceed without royal licence. It may be that Cole had been imprisoned in the interval, for in August 1551 the sheriff of London was paid for keeping Cole and two of his servants for fifteen months. In January 1551 the privy council committed Cole's case to trial, and on 16 April he was forced to resign his wardenship. He was replaced by Ralph Skinner, a sound evangelical. Yet three days later Cole was allowed to proceed BTh and DTh &#145;without any exercise done for it&#146;  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 4.128). These episodes leave Cole's religious opinions under Edward VI unclear. According to John Jewel, Cole came &#145;to the church &hellip; and heard the common prayers &hellip; ministered, and received the communion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.61), assertions Cole did not dispute. Lawrence Humphrey later embroidered them in his <span class="italic">Joannis Juelli &hellip; vita</span> (1573), emphasizing that Cole had preached obedience to Edward during the western rebellion of 1549. Nicholas Sander, by contrast, claimed that Cole had confessed his faith through resigning his benefices. On 25 October 1553 Cole became archdeacon of Ely, suggesting that Mary found him a reliable Catholic, and giving weight to Sander's interpretation. In 1553&#150;4 he served on commissions to restore bishops Bonner and Tunstall, and at about the time of his participation in the disputation with Latimer and Ridley at Oxford on 17&#150;18 April 1554, became canon and ninth prebendary of Westminster (presented 10 April, installed 21 April, held to 26 September 1556). On 13 July 1554 he was appointed provost of Eton (vacated by 5 July 1559), and was prolocutor of convocation in that year. On 17 March 1555 he brought word to Cranmer that there was no further hope for him.<br>
<br>Cole played a central role in the events immediately before Cranmer's execution on 21 March, above all by preaching a legally inventive sermon in the university church. In it Cole gave three reasons why Cranmer, although a repentant sinner, nevertheless had to die: the nullification of Henry's first marriage; heresy, &#145;of which he had been a most carnal defender&#146;  (Foxe, 1885); and in order to balance John Fisher's death. In summer 1556 Cole was one of Pole's visitors of Oxford, and he probably took a hand in revising the university's statutes. On 11 December 1556 he was elected dean of St Paul's, and then on the 29th was appointed to a commission to recover ex-monastic documents. Two days later he was entrusted with another important case, when Pole assigned him to investigate how the Drapers' Company of London was handling a bequest. On 1 January 1558 Cole received yet another appointment, becoming a member of a commission charged to survey the state of the church's finances, and was also ordered to help collect the clerical subsidy. On 8 February he received a commission to act against heresy and seditious books (he had already received a licence to read heretical works on 13 July 1555), which he immediately put to use in the visitation of Cambridge, where he was incorporated DTh on 16 February 1557. On 28 August Pole made him his archiepiscopal vicar-general, and on 1 October dean of arches, at which time he was apparently also acting as commissary of the prerogative court of Canterbury. On 16 November he and Dr Thomas Martin (a lawyer who had been Bishop Gardiner's chancellor) received a commission to burn anti-papal writings, and on 1 December Cole witnessed the installation of Sir Thomas Tresham as prior of the knights of St John of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Cole figured prominently in the convocation of 1558, submitting to it a plan for the redistribution of ecclesiastical revenues. Pole collated him to the rectory of Wrotham, Kent, on 6 July 1558. Two weeks later he received orders to visit All Souls. Either the difficulties were too great, or he proved unexpectedly incompetent, for Nicholas Harpsfield, who had by then replaced Cole as dean of arches, revisited the college in November, perhaps simply because Cole failed to turn over the records of his visitation. Cole's replacement by Harpsfield reflected a realignment of Canterbury administration, since Cole moved by 4 November to be commissary of the prerogative court there. Robert Ware, writing in the second half of the seventeenth century, but citing the manuscripts of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, and Sir James Ware, as well as the authority of Archbishop James Usher and others, and giving substantial amounts of circumstantial evidence, claimed that Mary, in October 1558, had sent Cole on a mission against heresy in Ireland. While waiting to embark from Chester his landlady, concerned for her brother in Dublin, substituted for Cole's commission a pack of cards, knave of clubs uppermost. When Cole arrived in Dublin and presented his &#145;commission&#146;, the deputy, the earl of Sussex, sent him back for a new one, remarking that &#145;we will shuffle the cards in the meanwhile&#146;  (Ware, 22&#150;3). The episode was retold in doggerel verse by one Peregrine Wilton in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, 25 (1829), 153&#150;8. Queen Mary's death soon afterwards ended Cole's concern with Ireland. Cole was one of the supervisors of Pole's will, however, and continued to be commissary of the prerogative court of Canterbury until some time in 1559.<br>
<br>After Elizabeth's accession Cole took the leading role for the Catholic side at the Westminster conference in March 1559. Sander reported at length Cole's speech defending the use of Latin in worship and admitted that he was surprised by Cole's holiness. Sander described his new hero as &#145;most learned in both laws, philosophy and theology&#146; and &#145;so abstemious in food, drink and sleep that no one would be thought to have lived in private life more happily&#146;  (Archivio Segreto Vaticano, armaria 64:28, fol. 266<i>v</i>). A version of Cole's text in English survives (Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 121, fols. 183&#150;91), and his major point concerned the necessity of unity with the whole church which vernacular worship would destroy. Cole put forward the subsidiary argument that English changed too much to be the language of divine service. Jewel contemptuously dismissed Cole's behaviour and remarks, writing to Peter Martyr that Cole, &#145;stamping his feet, throwing out his arms, bending sideways, snapping his fingers and raising and lowering his eyebrows by turns&#146;, had called the protestants the authors of sedition. Jewel concluded that &#145;I never heard anyone rave after a more solemn and school-masterly fashion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.1201&#150;2). He also accused Cole of having wrecked the meeting by refusing to abide by the agreed rules, and Cole was supposedly fined 500 marks for contempt.<br>
<br>Between 29 May and 5 July 1559 Cole lost all his benefices. Perhaps seeing the end coming, probably about this time he gave sixty-three books to St John's College, Oxford. They are primarily works of theology, philosophy, and biblical commentary, and include no legal texts. In early 1560 he engaged Jewel in a controversy which set the terms of Catholic&#150;protestant debate for most of Elizabeth's reign. Among the substantive points raised were the role of custom, the importance of argument from history, the pope's status, and the nature of the eucharist. Summoned before Elizabeth's visitors at Lambeth, Cole was committed to the Tower on 20 May 1560&#151;two days after Jewel's most detailed refutation of his arguments&#151;and was transferred to the Fleet on 10 June. About July 1561 he was proposed as bishop of London by an English exile. By the time of his death Cole had been moved to the Wood Street compter, where he died between 4 December 1579 and 1 January 1580. Cole left his unspecified property to his executor, Humphrey Moseley, a lawyer who was also secondary of the prison, and a man whom Cole called &#145;my trusty and well-beloved friend&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, fol. 24<i>v</i>).<br>
