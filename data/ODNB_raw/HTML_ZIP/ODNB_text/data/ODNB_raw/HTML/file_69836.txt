<span class="headword">Palmer,  Harold Edward</span>  (1877&#150;1949), <span class="occ">linguist and teacher of languages</span>, was born on 6 March 1877 at 63 Wornington Road, North Kensington, London, the elder child of Edward Palmer (<i>b</i>. 1853), schoolmaster and (from 1890) newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frostick (<i>b</i>. 1857). In the early 1880s his father moved the family back to his home town of Hythe in Kent, where he set up a school. Later he opened a stationery shop and in 1890 launched a local newspaper, the <span class="italic">Hythe Reporter</span>, a venture that provided his son with his first publishing opportunities.<br>
<br>Harold Palmer's education began at local elementary schools, but he was withdrawn at the age of ten and tutored at home for three years. He spent two further years at a small private secondary school in Hythe before leaving for good in 1892 at the age of fifteen. His later adolescent years included a six-month exchange visit with a family in Boulogne (1892&#150;3), but his time was largely spent pursuing personal interests like cycling, collecting fossils, playing the piano, and writing (mostly humorous) pieces for the <span class="italic">Reporter</span>. In 1899 he took over the paper's editorship for two years but then left Hythe to pursue a teaching career abroad.<br>
<br>By February 1902 Palmer was teaching English in a language school run on Berlitz (direct method) lines in Verviers, Belgium. The following year he established his own school, later known as the Institut Palmer, which flourished and in time came to occupy two separate sites in the town. On 19 November 1904 he married a local woman named Elisabeth Purnode (<i>b</i>. 1885), and a daughter, Dorothe&eacute;, was born on 28 April 1905.<br>
<br>During his time in Verviers, Palmer (who had no university training) set out on a determined course of self-education. He became a member of the local <i>soci&eacute;t&eacute; polyglotte</i> and started writing language teaching materials (his first book, <span class="italic">M&eacute;thode Palmer</span>, an English course for French speakers, appeared in 1906). He deepened his linguistic studies by joining the International Phonetic Association and had the first of many contributions accepted by its journal <span class="italic">Le Ma&icirc;tre Phon&eacute;tique</span> in 1910, work that attracted the attention of Britain's leading twentieth-century phonetician, Daniel Jones of University College, London.<br>
<br>Palmer and Jones met by chance on a cross-channel ferry in 1912, an encounter that proved helpful two years later when Palmer and his family, after being forced to escape hurriedly from German-occupied eastern Belgium, returned to England in straitened circumstances. After an attempt to start a school in Folkestone, Palmer took up a post teaching French in a London grammar school. He contacted Jones, who invited him to deliver a series of (extra-mural) lectures at University College on methods of language teaching, the success of which, plus Palmer's evident skill as a phonetician, encouraged Jones to employ him in the department. His duties included teaching spoken English and organizing a year-long course in language teaching methodology, the first of its kind at university level in Britain. Palmer's time at the college was unusually fruitful, and resulted in three substantial works that won him a lasting reputation as a leading thinker in the theory and practice of language teaching: <span class="italic">The Scientific Study and Teaching of Languages</span> (1917), <span class="italic">The Principles of Language-Study</span> (1921), and <span class="italic">The Oral Method of Teaching Languages</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Having established himself at home, Palmer moved on. He accepted a post as linguistic adviser to the Japanese ministry of education and in February 1922 left for Tokyo, where an Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET) was set up with Palmer as its director. The decision to focus on research was unique for its time, and made imaginative use of Palmer's academic and practical expertise. After opening in May 1923, the institute attracted a substantial membership and started a monthly journal, the <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. IRET's basic aims were well summarized later by Palmer's Tokyo colleague A. S. Hornby: &#145;(1) the compilation of English language courses; (2) the encouragement of reformed methods of language teaching; (3) the starting of research and experimental work in linguistic subjects, and (4) the training of teachers of English&#146;  (Hornby, 88). All IRET's work was underpinned by a strong theoretical framework derived from modern linguistics and psychology, in particular the ideas of Saussure and Bloomfield with their emphasis on spoken language, reflected in the titles of Palmer's major publications in the 1920s: <span class="italic">English Intonation</span> (1922), <span class="italic">A Grammar of Spoken English</span> (1924), <span class="italic">English through Actions</span> (classroom oral exercises devised with his daughter Dorothe&eacute;, 1925), <span class="italic">A Dictionary of English Pronunciation</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">The Five Speech-Learning Habits</span> (1927).<br>
<br>From the late 1920s onwards Palmer became increasingly interested in text simplification and vocabulary control. Dissatisfied with the educational limitations of word-frequency statistics, he conducted a series of lexicological studies with broader pedagogical relevance, laying the groundwork for an innovative learner's dictionary combining both grammatical and lexical information. To extend his linguistic expertise (and publicize the institute), he undertook a lengthy lecturing tour in 1931&#150;2 which took him to the United States, where he met Sapir and Bloomfield, both of whom became public supporters of his work in Tokyo. The culmination of these efforts came in 1935 with his participation in a working party (established in New York in 1934) to determine a definitive basic (&#145;general service&#146;) word-list for English language teaching. The provisional list appeared in the <span class="italic">Interim Report</span> (1936), but full publication was delayed until 1953.<br>
<br>Now approaching sixty and with the international situation deteriorating, Palmer decided to return to England and he left Japan with a DLitt from Tokyo Imperial University in the spring of 1936. On their return the Palmers settled at Felbridge, on the Surrey&#150;Sussex border, where Harold continued writing English language teaching materials, including <span class="italic">The New Method Grammar</span> (1938) for young learners, which used railways as a metaphor for grammar (he even constructed a working model in his garden), and <span class="italic">A Grammar of English Words</span> (1938). His last major work was his innovative <span class="italic">International English Course</span> (1943 onwards), which unexpectedly adopted a bilingual approach to make it suitable for self-instruction purposes. Various versions appeared in the mid-1940s, but it became enmeshed in London publishing politics and was discontinued.<br>
<br>In July 1942 Tristram, the Palmers' twenty-one-year-old son, was killed in action over the Netherlands while on a bombing mission. Harold Palmer never fully recovered from the shock, falling victim to serious depression and ill health (he had to return early from a lecturing tour of South America in 1944, for instance). He was also disappointed that his ideas for a British IRET fell on deaf ears.<br>
<br>With the end of the Second World War, however, the influence of IRET began to emerge. The British Council founded <span class="italic">English Language Teaching</span> using the IRET <span class="italic">Bulletin</span> as its model, with Hornby as editor. Hornby also took responsibility for the dictionary Palmer had initiated in the 1930s (now the world-famous <span class="italic">Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English</span>). In fact English language teaching in the 1950s and beyond reflected many of Palmer's pedagogical values: the emphasis on spoken language, for instance, the importance of ordered progression, and the need for effective classroom procedures. He died at his home, Coopers Wood, Felbridge, from acute heart failure on 16 November 1949, and was buried at Folkestone cemetery. His wife survived him. His death removed the man himself and with him the personality and charisma that had attracted so many people to him and to his ideas throughout his life.<br>
