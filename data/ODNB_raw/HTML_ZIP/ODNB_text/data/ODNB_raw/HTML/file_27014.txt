<span class="headword">Tayler,  Joseph  Needham</span>  (1785&#150;1864), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born at Devizes, Wiltshire, was the son of Samuel Tayler, five times mayor of Devizes and commandant of local volunteers, and his wife, Sally, daughter of Joseph Needham MD, and niece of Henry Needham, a partner in Child's Bank. An elder brother, Samuel Tayler, a lieutenant in the 13th light dragoons, was killed in the Peninsula; another, Thomas Tayler, major of the 9th Bengal native infantry, died in India.<br>
<br>Joseph entered the navy in July 1796 in the <i>Royal George</i>, flagship of Lord Bridport, and witnessed the Spithead mutiny in April and May 1797. In 1799 he was moved to the <i>Anson</i> with Captain Philip Durham, whom he followed in February 1801 to the <i>Endymion</i>. He was promoted lieutenant on 29 April 1802, and in October 1803 was appointed to the <i>Leopard</i>, one of the squadron with Lord Keith in the Downs and off Boulogne. In March 1806 the <i>Leopard</i> was sent to convoy six East Indiamen to the southward of the Cape Verde Islands, off the coast of west Africa; when one of them struck a reef near St Iago and became a total wreck, Tayler succeeded in saving thirty of the crew, though more were lost. In March 1807 he was moved to the <i>Maida</i>, one of the ships in the attack on Copenhagen, and landed in command of a party of seamen for one of the batteries. In 1808 he was in the <i>Spencer</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford, on the coast of France. In 1809 he was in the <i>Heroine</i>, and in 1810 in the <i>Goldfinch</i> on the north coast of Spain. On 27 August 1810 he was promoted commander of the <i>Sparrow</i> (16 guns), then in the West Indies, but did not join her until the following February. He then cruised in the Mona passage for several months to suppress piracy. He returned to England with a convoy, and in 1812 was employed on the north coast of Spain, co-operating with the army. He carried home the dispatches after the battle of Vitoria and returned to take part in the siege of San Sebastian, where, on 24 July in the sailors' battery, he was almost torn to pieces by an exploding shell&#151;his head was cut open, he had a severe wound in the groin, and his left leg was smashed. He was sent home and, on 9 August 1813, to the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital, where he was confined to bed for twenty-eight weeks. It was upwards of two years before his wounds were healed. In November 1814 he was awarded a pension of &pound;200 a year, which in 1815 was increased to &pound;250. He was also made a CB on 8 December 1815 and received &pound;100 from the Patriotic Fund and the freedom of Devizes.<br>
<br>From July 1838 to August 1841 Tayler was captain of the Ordinary at Plymouth; but, with this exception, the greater part of his life was passed at Devizes, which he devoted his energy and money to improving. He pulled down and rebuilt shops and houses, and stopped only when his funds were exhausted, for the improvements did not seem to have been a paying investment. He made various inventions, including a transporting carriage for ships' guns for field service ashore. In 1838 he took out a patent for &#145;a certain method of abating or lessening the shock or force of the waves &hellip; preventing the injury done to, and increasing the durability of, places exposed to the violent action of the waves&#146;, and improvements upon his original plan, which involved the construction of a floating breakwater made up of timber frames chained together and anchored to the seabed, were suggested by him in 1840, 1843, and 1846. In 1840 he published <span class="italic">Plans for the Formation of Harbours of Refuge</span>, and in 1848 <span class="italic">The Defence of the Coast of Great Britain</span>. At Brighton in 1845 three 60 foot sections of the floating breakwater were launched as a trial; a model of his breakwater was seen at the Great Exhibition of 1851, but it appears to have had only a modified success in practice. In 1852 he submitted to Trinity House a proposal to erect a &#145;shipwreck asylum&#146; on the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent. Nothing came of this proposal, but a harbour of refuge seems to have been erected at Le Havre in 1855 in accordance with his suggestions. Tayler accepted the rank of rear-admiral on the retired list on 10 October 1846. During his later life he resided at Brixton, Devon, where he died, unmarried, on 18 March 1864.<br>
