<span class="headword">Bonham,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1564&#150;<em>c.</em>1628), <span class="occ">physician and surgeon</span>, about whose early life nothing is known, matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, during the Easter term of 1581, which places his birth probably between 1563 and 1565. As a sizar, he most likely came from a relatively humble family. In 1584 he earned a bachelor's degree (which he took the trouble to incorporate at Oxford in the same year), and continued for the master's degree, which he completed in 1588. He apparently also earned a medical doctorate at Cambridge, for his later claim to one was never disputed; he therefore probably graduated in medicine in the middle to later 1590s, and certainly before he signed himself &#145;in Medic: Doct.&#146; in 1602, at the end of a laudatory Latin poem prefaced to a treatise on the king's evil by the surgeon William Clowes the elder.<br>
<br>Despite being a physician, Bonham took the side of the London surgeons in their disputes with the College of Physicians. His poem celebrated the work of one of the most prominent surgeons of London; in early 1605 he signed the unsuccessful parliamentary petition of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company asking for the right to administer internal remedies. But with the strengthening of the College of Physicians in the same years, Bonham presented himself to its censors on 6 December 1605 for the examination required for membership of that body. For whatever reason, he failed to answer the censors' questions to their satisfaction. Bonham underwent examination again on 14 April 1606, but this time his replies to questions were declared &#145;not pertinent&#146;. The censors went further in making an example of his disobedience: because he had practised without membership in or licence of the college, the censors fined Bonham &pound;5, and threatened him with imprisonment if he did not obey them. Bonham refused. On 3 October the censors recorded that Bonham had several times ignored their summons to appear before them to answer charges that he was continuing to practise without their permission, and that he would be arrested and fined &pound;10. On 7 November Bonham and his lawyer, Dr Smith, appeared before the censors. When asked by the college's president, Henry Atkins, if he had come to be re-examined or to make satisfaction, Bonham defiantly put on his hat and said that he practised and would continue to practise without seeking the permission of the college and without obeying the president, since they had no power over graduates of the universities. Standing on recently reiterated legal precedent, the president and censors sent Bonham to Newgate prison for contempt, to be held at their pleasure.<br>
<br>Bonham's lawyer managed to free him from Newgate by entering a writ of habeas corpus before the court of common pleas on 13 November. After some delays due to other business, the college officers met on 1 May 1607, at the home of Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, with a committee of royal judges, which unanimously supported a rigorous interpretation of the college's statutes. The censors also gathered further evidence of Bonham's continuing practice in London, including his work with one Mrs Paine of Aldersgate Street. Subsequently, in Trinity term of 1608, the censors sued Bonham for twelve months' illicit practice (or a total of &pound;60), with Attorney-General Hobart pleading their case before the court of king's bench. Bonham in turn returned to common pleas in the Michaelmas term of 1608, asking for &pound;100 damages against the college for trespass against his person and wrongful imprisonment. About 3 February 1609 king's bench found Bonham guilty of illicit practice, imposed the fine, and sent him to prison. (One month later his alleged accomplice, Mrs Paine, was also fined &pound;10 by the college and imprisoned.) Bonham nevertheless managed to become a member of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company and got Archbishop Bancroft to write a letter on 3 October 1609 strongly desiring the college to release him. The college replied that it would let Bonham out only if he acknowledged its authority and dropped his suit. He did not.<br>
<br>Bonham's suit in common pleas against the college was finally decided in late February 1610. The decision of the justices set Bonham free, and fined the college &pound;40. Chief Justice Edward Coke declared that because the College of Physicians was both judge and prosecuting body in cases brought before it, the parliamentary acts confirming the powers granted to it by charter were void:<blockquote>it appears in our books, that in many cases, the common law will controul Acts of Parliament &hellip; for when an Act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will controul it, and adjudge such Act to be void.</blockquote>Coke may have intended only to overturn the college's royal patent, but his language allowed eighteenth-century Americans to interpret his words as giving the courts jurisdiction over parliament, helping to create the idea of a powerful supreme court. Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, Sir Francis Bacon, and King James were all furious with Coke's decision.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1611 Bonham incorporated his MD at Oxford, and on 8 August 1614 he entered Gray's Inn. As late as 1617 a page of the queen, Michael Silvester, was requesting the half of Bonham's fine due to the king. Thomas Bretnor dedicated his translation and enlargement of Angelo Sala's <span class="italic">Opiologia, or, A Treatise Concerning &hellip; Opium</span> (1618), a work advocating chemical preparations, to Bonham (and also to Nicholas Carter). Bonham continued to practise medicine in London, signed a parliamentary petition of the surgeons against a new charter for the College of Physicians in 1621, served as an assistant in the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company, and apparently sponsored surgical experiments in his home. Bonham died in the late 1620s; his servant in medicine and surgery, Edward Poeton, edited and published Bonham's well-regarded papers on medicines as <span class="italic">The Chyrurgians Closet, or, An Antidotarie Chyrurgicall</span> (1630), dedicated both to Frances, countess of Exeter, and to the London Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company. Bonham's will, made on 16 July 1625, mentions his wife, Dorothy, and their son and daughter.<br>
