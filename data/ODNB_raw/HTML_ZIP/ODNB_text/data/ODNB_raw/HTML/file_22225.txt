<span class="headword">Pierce,  Samuel Eyles</span>  (1746&#150;1829), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born at Upottery rectory, near Honiton, Devon, on 23 June 1746, the son of Adam Pierce (1717&#150;1785), cabinet-maker, and Susannah Chilcott (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1770). Of retiring disposition as a boy, he was brought up in a church home, his maternal grandfather being vicar of Upottery and master of the grammar school in Honiton, where Pierce himself was educated. In this early experience of church, home, and school he confessed that he did not encounter spiritual religion. Unhappily apprenticed to a trade he himself had chosen, he lived with a real sense of dark forebodings, heavily influenced by events like the Lisbon earthquake, the Sherborne comet of 1768, several severe fires in Honiton, and a lightning strike on Moorfields Tabernacle which killed a worshipper. Very susceptible to guilt, he was prompted by his first communion to question whether he had &#145;consumed unworthily&#146;  (Pierce, 17). He was first &#145;brought under divine influence&#146; by reading Anthony Horneck's <span class="italic">The Crucified Jesus</span>, which brought him to understand that he was &#145;a regenerate man, one born into Christ, one born from above&#146;  (ibid., 17), though he does not allow that this was &#145;a gospel book&#146;, and the understanding seems to have been cerebral rather than experiential. Soon he was reading St Augustine, Doddridge's <span class="italic">Rise and Progress</span>, sermons by James Hervey and George Whitfield; he frequently walked the 5 or so miles to Broad Hembury to hear Augustus Toplady, who was one of the shaping influences in his life. Between February 1772 and August 1775 Pierce spent much time in London, where he was greatly influenced by William Romaine, the second major influence in his life: by contrast he was unimpressed by worship led by Charles Wesley at the Foundry Chapel.<br>
<br>An almost chance meeting with a group of female believers at Somerton in Somerset challenged Pierce to reflect seriously on seeking training for the ministry. Thus late in 1775 he was admitted to the countess of Huntingdon's college at Trefeca, where his experiences were unhappy. When first called upon to preach he dried up after only five minutes. Nevertheless he was soon found supplying churches in Hay-on-Wye and at Brecon. Witnesses indicate that his style approximated to that of Romaine; he himself confessed, &#145;I was all for preaching a finished salvation&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). After unsuccessful attempts to escape from college, he came to the personal notice of Lady Huntingdon, who sent him to serve the church in Gainsborough, but he soon transferred to Lincoln because the Gainsborough people accused him of antinomianism, a recurring charge against his preaching. Between 1776 and 1779 he was several times recalled to Trefeca and then dispatched on various itinerancies including time in Lincolnshire, Somerset, Sussex, Kent, and Cornwall, where Mr James Paynter of Boskenna became a loyal supporter and refuge. When Lady Huntingdon was not at Trefeca, and without resort to Romaine, Pierce described the college as a dungeon and thus resolved to abort all ideas of a preaching ministry. On completing an itinerant ministry for the countess of Huntingdon, he became free to take a fixed pastorate and settled with an Independent congregation in Truro in August 1783. He enjoyed immediate success, for the membership grew from thirty-six to ninety, and the chapel had to be extended.<br>
<br>Pierce's ordination took place on 15 September 1784, alongside that of Isaiah Birt, who was to have a distinguished Baptist ministry, at the Plymouth Dock Baptist Church with four senior Baptist ministers from Plymouth, Wellington, and Bristol participating under the leadership of Caleb Evans. Pierce married on 28 October 1784 a member of his Truro congregation, Mary Randall (<i>c</i>.1729&#150;1807/8), the widow of John. She kept a school and this clearly helped the family income. Pierce used the Truro church as a base for itinerancy, so his deacons were often responsible for weekday services. Pierce frequently supplemented his own preaching by reading the sermons of others; the congregation's favourite was John Gill followed by Romaine.<br>
<br>It was not long before accusations of antinomianism re-emerged, this time with the counter-accusation that the Arminians, presumably the local Methodists, were stirring up hostility. Pierce's congregation split, and it appears that Pierce's wife sided with his opponents, for he claims that because of this dispute he was &#145;driven from church, wife and home&#146;, and that his wife withdrew her financial support of his ministry. Because of physical illness, he retreated to Mr Paynter's residence at Boskenna, which in its turn led to the accusation that he had abandoned both his wife and his church. He became tutor to Mr Paynter's sons, but returned to Truro fairly frequently to preach in his old church and to celebrate communion. At the same time he conducted a wide itinerant ministry in the west country, responding to invitations that followed in the wake of the publication of his discourses from 1796 onwards. Pierce continued to care for Mr Paynter's two sons for about two years after the latter's death in 1800.<br>
<br>Pierce then extended his itinerancy to the London area, where he met with a mixed reaction to the high Calvinism he preached. One congregation, which included a considerable number of wealthy families who had previously attended on Romaine, was particularly attracted to his ministry, and this led to a settled pastorate for Pierce at Printer's Court, Shoe Lane, where in 1805 a new chapel was built for him by a Mr Arnold; the chandelier and accommodation for the pastor were provided by Mr Bailey of Stockwell. Walter Wilson wrote of the congregation, &#145;The people who assemble here, some of whom possess considerable substance, are double distilled Calvinists. And great admirers of some of the writers of that stamp, particularly Dr Goodwin&#146;  (Wilson, 3.416).<br>
<br>Pierce was still spending most summer months ministering in Truro, at least until the death of his first wife on 12 March 1807 or 1808. Wilson noted, &#145;As his people cannot endure any other preacher, they meet together during his absences and employ themselves in reading his sermons&#146;  (Wilson, 3.416). Pierce's patron, Mr Bailey, had also opened a chapel in Brixton, where Pierce preached on alternate Sunday evenings except on communion Sundays, when he spent the whole day at Shoe Lane. On 5 November 1819 he married Elizabeth Turquand (<i>b</i>. 1783/4), daughter of Leonard, a sugar baker of Whitechapel, at Clapham parish church. Elizabeth, who was much younger than Pierce, had been converted under her future husband's ministry. Mr Bailey provided lodgings for the couple, who soon found an itinerant ministry too burdensome.<br>
<br>Most information about Pierce derives from his <span class="italic">A true outline and sketch of the life of Samuel Eyles Pierce, minister of the everlasting gospel</span>, published in 1824, though clearly completed two years earlier. He gave full instructions for his funeral, including a funeral sermon which he started in April 1794 and last reworked in September 1819, with clear instructions that no other be preached. He in fact died full of years on 10 May 1829 in Acre Lane, Clapham, where he had lodgings with Mr Bailey, long-time patron of his London ministry. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
