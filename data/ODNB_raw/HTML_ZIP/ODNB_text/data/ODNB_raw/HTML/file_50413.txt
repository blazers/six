<span class="headword">Grant, Sir  Alexander</span>, first baronet  (1864&#150;1937), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born on 1 October 1864 in Forres, Moray, the eldest son of Peter Grant (1838&#150;1882), a guard with Highland Railway, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James and Elizabeth Norries. While he was a pupil at Forres Academy his father died, and he left school to be trained in the office of a writer to the signet. Unhappy with legal minutiae, he had himself apprenticed to Thomas Stuart, a small but progressive local baker. Once a journeyman, he moved to Edinburgh, where the biscuit manufacturer Robert McVitie engaged him as an assistant at &pound;1 a week.<br>
<br>Grant was both capable and ambitious, and McVitie made good use of his talents, encouraging him to attend lectures on food chemistry at Heriot-Watt College. Grant also tackled all available literature in English on the craft of baking and visited Europe to learn about biscuit manufacture there. On 31 July 1887 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Norris of Edinburgh; they had one son and two daughters. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to foreman, but he resigned to run a bakery in Inverness. When this venture failed McVitie reluctantly gave him his job back; after the Edinburgh factory was destroyed by fire, Grant was made manager of its temporary replacement in Yorkshire. He returned to manage the rebuilt factory, which was claimed to be the most up to date of its kind in Britain.<br>
<br>When in 1901 McVitie's partner, Charles Edward Price, retired, Grant was appointed general manager. He and McVitie established a branch factory at Harlesden, north London&#151;an audacious foray into the English biscuit-makers' territory. For three months after its start-up Grant travelled between Edinburgh and London on the sleeperless night train, during the week not spending a single night in his bed. The factory failed to become profitable until 1905, but by then its output was three times that of the Edinburgh factory.<br>
<br>McVitie died childless in 1910, and in June 1911 McVitie and Price Ltd was registered as a private limited company with &pound;150,000 capital. Grant became chairman and managing director. In 1914 he opened a further factory, in Manchester; it was soon being used to make army and emergency biscuits for the government. These and other wartime concerns took their toll of Grant, who fell ill with double pneumonia, but his robust constitution pulled him through. He then secured a shareholding control of the company, and by the 1920s was reported to head the largest one-man enterprise in Britain.<br>
<br>Between the wars Grant made some noteworthy benefactions, totalling about &pound;750,000. In 1920 he saved the taxpayer &pound;25,000 by cancelling for five years the interest on &pound;100,000 of war stock held by his firm. He donated a total of &pound;200,000 for the rebuilding and endowment of the National Library of Scotland, where his name is commemorated on the great window, and he gave Edinburgh University &pound;150,000 for various projects, for which he was made an honorary LLD. His most spectacular gesture&#151;originally anonymous, but his name soon leaked out&#151;was to provide Holyroodhouse with banqueting silver, linen, cutlery, and glassware&#151;all Scottish-made&#151;at a cost of &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>Public honours soon followed. In 1923 Grant was given the freedom of the city of Edinburgh, and he later became freeman of Forres and of Nairn. Then in June 1924 he received a baronetcy for public services, apparently mooted before James Ramsay MacDonald had become prime minister the previous January. MacDonald, a native of Lossiemouth near Forres, was a friend of Grant, and his secretary persuaded Grant to meet some of the expenses of living at 10 Downing Street for the first premier who lacked a private income. Grant therefore loaned to MacDonald a Daimler car and &pound;40,000 worth of securities.<br>
<br>In September 1924 the British press heard about the loan and linked it with the award of the baronetcy as the latest example of the &#145;honours scandals&#146; that had beset earlier administrations. If MacDonald, and indeed his advisers, acted with a mixture of imprudence and unworldliness, Grant was politically quite as na&iuml;ve in reassuring MacDonald that &#145;it is only the opinion of good people that matters and that guides public opinion, however loud the others may be&#146;  (Marquand, 359). Never a Labour supporter Grant dubbed himself a lifelong conservative, but for some reason he backed a Liberal candidate for an Edinburgh seat in 1924.<br>
<br>Grant had a round face with a full moustache and was of stocky build. He exerted himself quite as hard as he worked his employees, and indeed his son, Robert McVitie Grant. Robert, who was a modernizer like his father, died a bachelor at fifty-two, in 1947. Grant kept clear of society and enjoyed the countryside through motoring and golf. He was not involved in public affairs, apart from serving as a JP, and his religion was that of a good and practical Christian.<br>
<br>A committed supporter of the Industrial Welfare Society, in 1921 Grant suggested to the future George VI the idea of a summer camp jointly for boys from independent schools and from industry. He subsidized the first few &#145;Duke of York&#146; camps, which continued annually until the Second World War. In business he remained fully active into his seventies. He caught a bad chill on the train back to Edinburgh after attending the king's coronation, and died at his home, 15 Hermitage Drive, Edinburgh, on 21 May 1937 from pneumonia. He was buried at Forres, and was survived by his wife.<br>
