<span class="headword">Boyse,  Joseph</span>  (1660&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious writer</span>, was born at Leeds on 14 January 1660, one of sixteen children of Matthew Boyse, clothesworker, and Elizabeth Jackson. His father was a puritan and former elder of the church at Rowley, New England, and was afterwards resident for about eighteen years at Boston, Massachusetts, before returning to Leeds. On 16 April 1675 Joseph Boyse entered Richard Frankland's academy at Kendal and in 1678 studied at Edward Veal's academy in Stepney. In 1679 he began to preach at Glassenbury, near Cranbrook, in Kent, and ministered there for almost a year. In 1681 he became domestic chaplain to the dowager countess of Donegal in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and in 1682 ministered for six months in the Brownist church in Amsterdam, though retaining his Presbyterian principles. But for the penal laws he would have settled in England. In 1683, on the death of his friend Timothy Haliday, he was persuaded to succeed him in Dublin as colleague to Dr Daniel Williams, then minister of Wood Street. When Williams resigned in 1687 Boyse remained, and here he continued to exercise his ministry for the remaining forty-one years of his life. In 1699 he married Rachel Ibbetson of Leeds; they had three children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3152/', "Samuel Boyse")</script>, who became a gifted poet; Joseph, who probably died in infancy; and a daughter, who married a Mr Waddington.<br>
<br>Boyse's ordination sermon in Dublin was preached by John Pinney, ejected from Broadwindsor, Dorset. During the greater part of his ministry Boyse was a noted advocate of the Presbyterian cause, defending Presbyterian rights and liberties, and setting forth the teachings of the Christian faith in sermons and pamphlet literature. Early on he came into conflict with William King, chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and subsequently bishop of Derry and archbishop of Dublin. King had attacked the Presbyterians in his &#145;Answer&#146; to Peter Manby, a former dean of Derry who had converted to Catholicism. This led Boyse to publish his first work, <span class="italic">Vindiciae Calvinisticae</span>, in 1688, in which he rejected King's definition of the church as those who profess the religion of Christ and live under lawful spiritual governors, insisting that the true church can only be defined in relation to the truth for which it stands. Though forcefully argued, Boyse's pamphlet breathed an eirenical spirit, and concluded with a plea for co-operation and mutual respect between episcopal and reformed churches in spite of deep differences of judgement and practice.<br>
<br>Boyse was to cross swords with King again. In 1690 he published an important political pamphlet vindicating the Revd Alexander Osborne of Newmarket from a charge against him by Walker, governor of Derry, that he was Tyrconnell's spy. An interesting printed letter is extant in the British Library entitled <span class="italic">Great News from the Camp before Limrick in a Letter from J. Boyse of Dublin to Tho. Parkhurst</span>. It is dated 28 August 1690 and claims to be the &#145;last letter from Limrick that can be given credit to&#146;  (<span class="italic">Great News from the Camp before Limrick</span>, 1690). It contains many vivid details of the siege. In 1693 he published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Sacramental Hymns</span> intended to supplement the psalter at communion services. In 1694 and 1695 Boyse resumed his controversy with King, who had tried to prove to the dissenters in the diocese of Derry that their ways of worship, and not those of the established church, fell short of what scripture taught. In his <span class="italic">Remarks</span> (1694) Boyse produced a major work of controversy, ably answering King's arguments and demonstrating factual inaccuracies. King replied by publishing a second edition of his work, together with a further <span class="italic">Admonition</span>. Boyse responded with <span class="italic">A Vindication of the &#145;Remarks&#146;</span> (1695). Both works contain a wealth of fascinating information about congregational life and worship among the dissenters in Ireland, both north and south. Boyse was now firmly established as a formidable and scholarly controversialist, and a liberal-minded dissenter in the tradition of Richard Baxter, whose works he so often quoted.<br>
<br>The year 1695 was one of considerable literary activity on Boyse's part, including a sermon on the death of Queen Mary and two pamphlets arguing the case for a bill of indulgences for the dissenters. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the campaign to repeal the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>. His pamphlet of 1695, <span class="italic">The Case of the Protestant Dissenters in Ireland</span>, argued strongly against the illogicality of the current toleration <i>de facto</i> but not <i>de jure</i>, and pleaded the excellent service rendered by dissenters during the revolution. It takes strong theological exception to Anglican communion being made a test for civil and military office. In answer to two replies from Tobias Pullen, bishop of Dromore, and Anthony Dopping, bishop of Meath, Boyse published <span class="italic">The Case of the Protestant Dissenters&#151;Vindicated</span>. The position of the dissenters worsened after the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1704. Threat of rebellion in 1715 led to a number of dissenters defying the law and endeavouring to serve the crown. A bitter attack on them by Dr William Tisdal, vicar of Belfast, elicited a reply from Boyse in 1716 entitled <span class="italic">Remarks on a Pamphlet Issued by William Tisdal DD</span>. The issue was to remain a pressing one for the dissenters until the passing of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1719 which, although it fell short of their ultimate hopes, was clearly the most they could get at that time.<br>
<br>Boyse's sermon before the Societies for the Reformation of Manners was published in 1698. In 1701 he published <span class="italic">Family Hymns for Morning and Evening Worship</span>, all of them based on psalms, and including a melody line and bass part.<br>
<br>Boyse entered into the controversy precipitated by the case of Thomas Emlyn, who had been appointed as Boyse's colleague at Wood Street in 1691, and who, unknown to Boyse, or to the congregation, had parted company with the orthodox doctrines of the Trinity and the person of Christ, and had become an Arian. For eleven years he exercised a popular ministry in Wood Street, but one member of his congregation, a physician, who for a time had studied theology, became concerned at consistent omissions in Emlyn's preaching and, after having discussed the matter with Boyse, he and Boyse confronted him with their suspicions. Emlyn readily admitted his convictions, but Boyse felt the matter must be brought before the Dublin ministers, who decided to depose him. Emlyn insisted on writing an account of what had happened, and later published his <span class="italic">Humble Inquiry into the Scripture Account of the Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1702). As a result Emlyn was tried and convicted of blasphemy and imprisoned from 16 June 1703 until 21 July 1705. Boyse set out to defend the orthodox doctrine in <span class="italic">A Vindication of the True Deity of our Blessed Saviour</span> (1703). In his very first work Boyse had spoken out against Socinianism, and in a letter written to Robert Wodrow in 1720 there is clear evidence that his abhorrence of those who denied the Trinity remained unaltered.<br>
<br>Boyse also published funeral sermons on the death of Elias Travers (1705) and of William Cairns (1707). In 1708 he brought out a two-volume edition of some of his sermons. The most controversial was &#145;The office of a scriptural bishop&#146;, which drew forth a reply from two Dublin curates, Edward Drury and Matthew French. The sermon was printed separately in 1709 and Boyse added a lengthy postscript in which he replied to the two clergy. This work had the distinction of being burned by the common hangman by order of the Irish House of Lords in November 1711. He continued the controversy on ministerial orders in 1712 by a lengthy work entitled <span class="italic">A Clear Account of the Ancient Episcopacy</span>, in which he sought to defend the reformed doctrine of ministry. The death of Queen Anne and the accession of George I in 1714 led to the publication of two sermons, while in 1716 he published a funeral sermon for Sir Arthur Langford and an ordination sermon for Dr John Leland, disappointing in that it says nothing about Leland, who was to become a man of such eminence.<br>
<br>Boyse was consistently opposed to Roman Catholicism. In the years 1687 and 1688 he had preached about the principal points of difference and composed a catechism (now lost) for his young people to highlight these concerns. In 1718 he launched an attack upon Catholicism in a sermon entitled <span class="italic">Popery Proved to be a Different Gospel</span>, together with a lengthy preface.<br>
<br>Boyse also became deeply involved in the struggle over subscription, which was to monopolize the debates of the synod of Ulster for nearly a decade. He was present at the synod in Belfast in 1721 as a commissioner from Dublin. In 1721, together with Nathanael Weld and Richard Choppin, Boyse wrote a letter to Dr Victor Ferguson, secretary of the Belfast Society. In 1722 Boyse's was the major hand in a preface to John Abernethy's <span class="italic">Seasonable Advice</span> and in the later <span class="italic">Postscript</span> (1724). Both works plead for charity and offer a <i>via media</i> solution. Boyse and his friends were concerned for the preservation of doctrinal orthodoxy while at the same time wanting charity and comprehensiveness to be the marks of ecclesiastical fellowship.<br>
<br>Boyse preached at the 1722 synod in Londonderry, and the sermon was published in 1723 in a personal letter to the northern ministers pleading with them not to sever connections with their non-subscribing brethren. In 1724 he published funeral sermons for Mrs Mary Choppin and Dr Duncan Cumyng, and a volume of sermons entitled <span class="italic">Discourses on the Four Last Things</span>. He then published a <span class="italic">Vindication of a Private Letter</span> (1726) in answer to John McBride's charges that the Dublin ministers were partisan and working for the non-subscribers. It reflects not only Boyse's own views on subscription but his deep personal sorrow at the course of events that inevitably was to end in rupture. The last work he himself was to publish was a sermon preached in 1727, <span class="italic">The Sole Headship of Christ</span>, in opposition to the claims of Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>The zenith of Boyse's career as a writer came only a few months before his death with the publication of his collected works by a London press. They occupy two huge folios usually bound as one, and are the earliest, if not the only, folios published by a Presbyterian minister in Ireland. The volumes went out with a recommendation signed by Edmund Calamy and a number of other London ministers. They contain a number of important sermons and treatises not hitherto published, as well as omitting one or two works. At the end of the first volume there are two works of great significance on the doctrine of justification revealing a close affinity between Boyse's theology and that of Richard Baxter. Early in his own career some of the Dublin ministers had charged Boyse with Pelagianism. The charge had evidently been answered satisfactorily. On the issues of justification and election, however, it is clear that Boyse, like Baxter, stood for a modification of Calvinism, and this difference in emphasis and direction brought him into conflict with the authoritarian views of some of his contemporaries. In the second volume, as well as two pieces on the Roman controversy, there is a fascinating attack on the Quakers, which called forth a reply shortly before Boyse's death from a Dublin schoolmaster, Samuel Fuller.<br>
<br>To survey Boyse's writing is to be impressed not only by the range of its subject matter but by the breadth of his learning and skill as a debater. While often polemical, he produced excellent pastoral and devotional material. His warm humanity and sincere personal grief over the bitter divisions of his latter years are reflected not only in his formal writings but in what personal correspondence has survived, notably his letters to Ralph Thoresby of Leeds. It would also appear that some sort of personal memoir had been written by Boyse himself, and valuable quotations from it are made in Choppin's funeral sermon.<br>
<br>Boyse's final years were marked by increasing ill health and by sadness at the irresponsible behaviour of Samuel, his son. For several months before the end he was unable to carry out his duties. He died in Dublin on 22 November 1728.<br>
<br>Boyse was a most conscientious pastor and preacher. He did not possess the natural gifts of a clear, strong voice, nor skills of elocution, yet his preaching had a deep effect upon his hearers. His sermons were well argued and firmly based upon the exposition of scripture which was a hallmark of the puritan tradition. Like Baxter he was comprehensive in his churchmanship. Indeed southern Presbyterianism, with its more English ethos, had a less rigid view of church government than was the case in Scotland and the north of Ireland.<br>
<br>Boyse had a passion for theological education. He himself was a product of the dissenting academies and was a &#145;patron&#146; of the academy of Dr Thomas Dixon in Whitehaven. In co-operation with the other Dublin ministers he helped to provide training in divinity for students, and was instrumental in setting up an academy in Dublin and attracting as its teacher the brilliant Francis Hutcheson.<br>
<br>Boyse played a significant part in the life of Dublin, giving with a generosity that exhausted his slender means, encouraging reformation of manners, and speaking out on behalf of French protestant refugees. He composed the Latin inscription on the original pedestal (1701) of the equestrian statue of William III that once occupied a place of prominence in College Green, Dublin.<br>
<br>One of the ironies of history is that a man of such eminence, who was referred to by contemporaries as &#145;the great Mr Boyse&#146;, should be so largely forgotten by historians of Irish Presbyterianism until recent times. Perhaps it was his unpopular stand in the subscription controversy or the fact that he stood largely outside the dominant Ulster Scots ethos of later Irish Presbyterianism. Perhaps it lay in the fact that the age that followed was weary of doctrinal controversy, and in such an age the liberal puritanism of Boyse may well have seemed largely irrelevant.<br>
