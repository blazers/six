<span class="headword">Talbot,  Howard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Richard Lansdale Munkittrick]</span>  (1865&#150;1928), <span class="occ">composer and songwriter</span>, was born on 9 March 1865 in New York, USA, the son of an Irishman, Alexander Munkittrick, and his wife, Lillie. In 1869 the family returned to Britain, where their son later studied first medicine at King's College, London, and then music at the Royal College of Music. He married on 21 March 1895 the actress Amy Clare Betts 
    (Ada Bellamy; 1871?&#150;1895)
  , who died eight months after their wedding, and later Dorothy Maud, the daughter of Arthur H. Cross of Sandringham, Norfolk. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>From early on he aimed at a career in the musical theatre, and his first stage pieces were produced by amateurs at Hunstanton, Oxford, and King's Lynn; he always used the pseudonym of Howard Talbot for his musical output. His first professionally staged piece, the comic opera <span class="italic">Wapping Old Stairs</span> (1894), had only a brief run, and although his next work, <span class="italic">Monte Carlo</span> (1896), did better, Talbot found his earliest niche in the theatre in the 1890s as a conductor, leading the orchestra for a number of shows in London and the provinces, where his &#145;cheery, goodnatured&#146; character made him the &#145;most genial and easy of conductors&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 19 April 1902).<br>
<br>In 1899, however, Talbot provided the score for a little provincial musical comedy written by the popular librettist George Dance, and his fortunes turned. <span class="italic">A Chinese Honeymoon</span> soon proved itself a long-touring success, and when it was ultimately given a London run it turned into a record-breaker, becoming the first musical play anywhere to run for more than 1000 consecutive metropolitan performances.<br>
<br>Over the following decade Talbot&#151;while continuing to work as a theatre conductor&#151;turned out a steady stream of musical comedy scores, and shows such as <span class="italic">The Blue Moon</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The White Chrysanthemum</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Girl behind the Counter</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">The Belle of Brittany</span> (1908), for which he composed all or much of the music, were played with considerable success all around the English-speaking world. Then, in 1909, he topped all but his first huge hit when he combined with Lionel Monckton to write the score for Robert Courtneidge's production of the fantastical musical comedy <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span>. With <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span>, Talbot had his name at the billhead of the most successful musical comedy of the Edwardian era&#151;just as he had a decade earlier with the most successful of the Victorian age.<br>
<br>In the years that followed Talbot continued to turn out light, tuneful songs and well-made but unpretentious concerted music for a whole series of musical shows. These included <span class="italic">The Mousm&eacute;</span> (1911) with its charming high soprano solos, moulded to the voice of the <span class="italic">Arcadians</span> star Florence Smithson, Courtneidge's up-to-date <span class="italic">The Pearl Girl</span> (1913), the interesting light opera <span class="italic">My Lady Frayle</span> (1915), which was full of good things but was dogged by bad luck, and the clever modern musical comedy <span class="italic">Mr Manhattan</span> (1916), written around the American musical-comedy star Raymond Hitchcock. Talbot also scored several short musical comedies for the music-hall stage.<br>
<br>At this point in time, many of the most important musical-theatre composers of the previous two decades were disappearing from the scene, unable or unwilling to adapt to the newly popular styles and rhythms in theatre music which had crossed the Atlantic in the years before the war. Talbot, whose educated but attractive and catchy writing was in no way bred to ragtime and the other rhythms of the American dance repertory, held his own, however, and at the height of the craze for what would become known as jazz he put his name to a third major hit. Teamed again with the equally &#145;old-fashioned&#146; Monckton, he provided the score in 1917 for the musical comedy <span class="italic">The Boy</span>, a piece based on Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's play <span class="italic">The Magistrate</span>. With the comedian Bill Berry as star, <span class="italic">The Boy</span> took its place alongside <span class="italic">Chu Chin Chow</span> and <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mountains</span> as one of the trio of great hits of the British wartime years, before going on to further success on Broadway (as <span class="italic">Good Morning, Judge</span>) and the touring and colonial circuits. Talbot&#151;paired this time with the young Ivor Novello&#151;provided Berry with a second decided Pinero-based hit in <span class="italic">Who's Hooper</span> (1918), but a third attempt at adapting Pinero, <span class="italic">My Nieces</span> (1921), was a failure. It was also its writer's last West End score.<br>
<br>Talbot subsequently retired and, although he continued to compose, his last works were, like his first, for amateur companies. He died on 12 September 1928 at Reigate, Surrey, survived by his widow, Dorothy.<br>
