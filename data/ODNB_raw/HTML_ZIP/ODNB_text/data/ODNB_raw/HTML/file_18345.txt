<span class="headword">Matthews,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1755, <em>d.</em> 1826), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, baptized on 30 October 1755 at Linton, Herefordshire, was the only surviving child of William Matthews (<i>d</i>. 1799), of Burton in Linton, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1768), daughter of Philip Hoskyns of Bernithen Court, Herefordshire. He matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 14 February 1772, and graduated BA in 1778, MA in 1779, MB in 1781, and MD in 1782. On 30 September 1782 he was a candidate for the Royal College of Physicians, and a year later he became a fellow. On 9 November 1778, Matthews married at Marcle, Herefordshire, Elizabeth (1756/7&#150;1823), daughter and heir of Arthur Ellis. They had eight sons and six daughters. Among their sons were Charles Skynner Matthews, the friend of Byron, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18344/', "Henry Matthews (1789&#150;1828)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">The Diary of an Invalid</span> (1820).<br>
<br>From 20 April 1781 to his resignation in 1783 Matthews was the physician to St George's Hospital, London, and in 1784 he delivered the Goulstonian lectures. He then retired from medicine and returned to Herefordshire. He acquired the estate of Clehonger, near Hereford, and by 1790 had built there the mansion of Belmont. A sapling planted by him in 1788 became famous as Colonel Matthews's oak, and was marked by a cast-iron tablet. For the rest of his life Matthews took a leading part in county affairs. He acted as mayor of Hereford in 1793, and was senior alderman and magistrate for twenty years. He was also colonel of the first regiment of Hereford militia, chairman of quarter sessions, and member of parliament for the county from 31 March 1803 to 1806.<br>
<br>John Matthews was a man of versatile disposition and generous tastes, which frequently left him at a financial loss. His works were published anonymously. The best-known of them is <span class="italic">Eloisa en dishabille: being a new version of that lady's celebrated epistle to Abelard, done into familiar English metre by a lounger</span> (1780), which is a parody of Pope's &#145;Eloisa to Abelard&#146;. It was reprinted in 1801, and again in 1822, when the bookseller put on the title-page that it was &#145;ascribed to [Richard] Porson&#146;. Matthews wrote other verse, some of it described as &#145;contemptible&#146; by contemporaries, and much of it badly received. He died after a long illness at Belmont on 15 January 1826. A monument to his memory was placed in the south aisle of Clehonger church.<br>
