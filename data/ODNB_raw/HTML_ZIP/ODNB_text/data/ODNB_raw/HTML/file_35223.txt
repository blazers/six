<span class="headword">Nichols,  Robert Malise Bowyer</span>  (1893&#150;1944), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was born at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, on 6 September 1893, the elder son of John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols (1859&#150;1939) of Lawford Hall, Essex, artist and author and a descendant of John Nichols, the eighteenth-century antiquary. His mother was Catherine Louisa Pusey (1872&#150;1942), daughter of Captain Edward Bouverie Pusey RN of Manningtree, Essex, a nephew of the theologian Edward Bouverie Pusey. Nichols's brother, Sir Philip B. B. Nichols (1894&#150;1962), was ambassador to the Netherlands (1948&#150;51); his sister Irene (1896&#150;1977), married the educational administrator George Gater and a younger sister, Anne Sadelbia Mary (1902&#150;1988), married the lawyer and politician Henry George Strauss (later Lord Conesford). Educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Oxford (1913&#150;14), Nichols asserted that he owed most to his own unmethodical private reading. The outbreak of the First World War cut short his university career. Nichols joined the Royal Field Artillery and, as a second lieutenant, went to France on 20 August 1915, moving to the frontline on 16 September. His medical record notes that &#145;From the first&#146; Nichols &#145;began to present Symptoms of Insomnia&#146;, that he collapsed on 26 September, and that he was &#145;invalided home with Nervous lack of Control&#146; (12 Jan 1916; TNA: PRO, WO 339/18193). He returned to England in October 1915 and, following three months' leave, was judged to be still suffering from a &#145;nervous state&#146;  (ibid.). Declared permanently unfit for general or home service, he spent several months in hospital. In 1917 he was attached to the Foreign Office and in the following year went with the British mission (Ministry of Information) to New York.<br>
<br>Having begun to write verse at school, Nichols became one of the soldier&#150;poets of the First World War; his <span class="italic">Invocation</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">Ardours and Endurances</span> (1917) were widely read and quoted and established him as one of the more highly acclaimed younger poets of the day. He was regarded as a sort of new Rupert Brooke, and in E. B. Osborn's noted collection <span class="italic">The Muse in Arms</span> (1917) he was represented more copiously than any other writer. Like his friends Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves, Nichols wrote graphic records of the battlefield, but his poetry was inherently more idealistic.<br>
<br>In 1921, after haunting Oxford for a time as a poetical personality, Nichols accepted the chair of English at Tokyo Imperial University. The opportunity of a closer view of Japanese art and culture suited his aesthetic habits. As a professor he sought to train new men of letters rather than competent academics. Illness disturbed his programme, but his lectures were amusing and invigorating. He became a busy and zealous essayist in the <span class="italic">Japan Advertiser</span>, writing on an abundance of subjects; among his papers there a series of articles on contemporary English novelists was the most considerable. He also translated the poems of the seventeenth-century Japanese poet Chikamatsu Monzaemon into English. On 11 July 1922, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, he married Norah Madeline (1892&#150;1960), daughter of Frederick Anthony Denny, of Horwood House, Winslow, Buckinghamshire, and niece of the composer Roger Quilter. They had no children. In 1924 Nichols resigned his professorship and went to Hollywood, where he acted as adviser to Douglas Fairbanks senior in his film-making.<br>
<br>Nichols regarded himself as a writer of plays; he wrote in other genres&#151;prose fiction in <span class="italic">Fantastica</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Under the Yew</span> (1928), and metrical satire in <span class="italic">Fisbo</span> (1934)&#151;but the drama <span class="italic">Guilty Souls</span> (1922), stirring but unconvincing, announced his principal object, never successfully realized. <span class="italic">Twenty Below</span> (with Jim Tully, 1927) and <span class="italic">Wings over Europe</span> (with Maurice Browne, 1932), though striking, had little success in the theatre; and his vast project <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, about which he constantly talked, was never completed. Drama took precedence over lyrical poetry, where his promise had been first recognized; the volume <span class="italic">Aurelia</span> (1920), containing among other things a Shakespearian sonnet series, was the last of its kind from him. After 1926 he lived in England, at first at Winchelsea in Sussex, finding his pleasures in music, the fine arts, conversation, and letter-writing. In response to the Second World War he published an <span class="italic">Anthology of War Poetry, 1914&#150;1918</span> (1943) containing a characteristic discourse in which he generously recalled the soldier&#150;poets of his earlier years.<br>
<br>Nichols was tall, thin, and impulsive in movement, with a face in which the wit and the poet found expression by turns. His talk was rapid and humorous, but tending towards the defence of the lofty Romantic attitude of which he saw himself as a protagonist. His long list of heroes, often recommended to his listeners and correspondents, included Goethe and Berlioz. He wished to be a bohemian character in modern life. Confident of his powers, he was nevertheless an example of unselfish activity on behalf of the work of other authors, new or old. The discovery of the work of the American poet Vachel Lindsay was one of his great successes. As a poet he was probably hindered rather than helped by his preoccupation with world literature; at all events he did not fulfil his ambitious or visionary schemes. In 1942 he published a selection of his poems entitled <span class="italic">Such was my Singing</span>. Nichols died at Cambridge on 17 December 1944 and was buried in Lawford, near Manningtree, Essex. He was survived by his wife, who died on 9 June 1960.<br>
