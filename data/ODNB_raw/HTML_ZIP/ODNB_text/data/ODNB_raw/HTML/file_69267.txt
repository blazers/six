<span class="headword">Steel,  Robert Walter</span>  (1915&#150;1997), <span class="occ">geographer and university administrator</span>, was born in Station Road, Theale, Berkshire, on 31 July 1915, the elder son of Frederick Grabham Steel (1875&#150;1948), Congregational minister, and his wife, Winifred Barry, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harrison (1888&#150;1974). After the family moved to Gorleston, Norfolk, he was educated at Great Yarmouth grammar school, then, following another move, at Cambridge and County High School for Boys. Entering Jesus College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner, he graduated with first-class honours in geography in 1937, having won the Royal Geographical Society's essay prize for &#145;The trade of the United Kingdom with Europe&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> in 1936). A Drapers' Company scholarship in 1937&#150;8 provided for research on Sierra Leone, leading to the higher Oxford degree of BSc in 1939, and initiating a lasting involvement with sub-Saharan Africa. Appointed to a departmental lectureship in geography in 1939, he married a fellow Oxford geographer (a graduate of St Anne's College), Eileen Margaret Page (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), elder daughter of Arthur Ernest Page, gentlemen's outfitter, of Bournemouth, at Richmond Hill Congregational Church, Bournemouth, on 9 January 1940. Their lifelong partnership was one of shared geographical interests and a close family life, with two daughters, Alison and Elizabeth (both of whom graduated in geography), and a son, David.<br>
<br>The Second World War interrupted Steel's academic career, although he remained in Oxford to work on African affairs for the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty from 1940 to 1945. In 1945&#150;7 he was geographer on the interdisciplinary Ashanti social survey, in the cocoa-producing area of the Gold Coast, enriching his understanding of the socio-economic and environmental aspects of development. Friendships with local people were among the most rewarding and lasting of many made over the next fifty years and reflected the qualities of the man as much as the geographer. Returning to Oxford in 1947 as lecturer in colonial (later Commonwealth) geography and (from 1951) lecturer at St Peter's Hall, he became official fellow and tutor in geography at Jesus College in 1954.<br>
<br>Appointed in 1957 to the John Rankin chair of geography at the University of Liverpool, in the oldest-established honours school of geography in Britain, Steel expanded undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and the range of staff research. Studies of Africa and the tropics developed significantly. He identified closely with all aspects of departmental life even when increasingly caught up in university affairs, as dean of the faculty of arts (1965&#150;8) and pro-vice-chancellor (1971&#150;3).<br>
<br>A lasting commitment to the people of Africa shaped Steel's scholarly interests. His initial research, based on fieldwork in Sierra Leone in 1938, was done mainly on foot in a country with a very limited transport infrastructure. He met African people in their homes and fields and came to understand their communities and environments. His appreciation of the social and economic significance of these relationships was greatly enhanced by his work in the Ashanti survey of 1945&#150;7. A pioneering paper with his Oxford colleague E. W. Gilbert on &#145;Social geography and its place in colonial studies&#146; (published in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> in 1945) promoted a growing involvement of British geographers with African studies. Africa continued to occupy much of his life, including a visiting professorship at the University of Ghana in 1964 and research in many parts of Anglophone Africa. His presidential address to the Institute of British Geographers, &#145;Problems of population pressure in tropical Africa&#146; (published in the institute's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1970) underlined the centrality of relationships between population and land in the cultural, political, and economic contexts of African society. Interdisciplinary studies were fostered through the African Studies Association of the UK (of which he was president in 1970&#150;71) and the Royal African Society (of which he was a vice-president from 1977). Eileen often accompanied him on research trips and they collaborated on a text published as <span class="italic">Africa</span> (1974).<br>
<br>Steel's presidential addresses to section E of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, &#145;Geography and the developing world&#146; (1965), and to the Geographical Association, on the needs of the world's &#145;have-nots&#146; (1973), made a strong case for the practical relevance of the discipline allied to a characteristically humanitarian concern for people in the developing world. Growth in the breadth of those interests was reflected in <span class="italic">Geographical Essays on British Tropical Lands</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Geographers and the Tropics: Liverpool Essays</span> (1964), both co-edited with R. Mansell Prothero.<br>
<br>The invitation to become principal of the University College of Swansea in 1974 was unexpected. Confronted by student unrest, not of his making, Steel won over the conflicting parties by calm and balanced assessment and a streak of toughness. The challenges of providing for growth and enhanced academic status at a time of diminishing resources were met with integrity, administrative skill, hard work, and a genuine interest in other people. Rebuilding administrative and academic systems, and through care for all his charges&#151;students, academic colleagues, and support staff&#151;he enhanced morale and achievement in the college. A building programme including the sports hall and the Taliesin Arts Centre was a legacy of the Steel era and a reflection of his range of interests. If there were reservations over appointing an Englishman, Steel's background at Jesus College, the &#145;Welsh college&#146;, was reassuring. He was vice-chancellor of the University of Wales in 1978&#150;81, and a Swansea colleague recalled that he discharged his duties &#145;like a true Welshman&#146;  (private information), though without command of a language that, he confessed, was too difficult for him.<br>
<br>The Steels' commitment to Swansea and south Wales was impressive. As principal, Steel did much to repair and foster town&#150;gown relations: a local MP commented that he &#145;contributed enormously to our community&#146;. The decision to remain in Swansea after retirement in 1982 extended their activities. Steel was involved with the Lower Swansea Development Group (1979&#150;88) and the Glamorgan Trust for Nature Conservation (1982&#150;6) and was chairman of Swansea Civic Society (1988&#150;97). A lasting contribution was to the Swansea festival of music and the arts: as chairman (1982&#150;95) he raised its international status. He was on the board of the Wales Advisory Body for Local Authority Higher Education (1982&#150;6) and became vice-president of the Workers' Educational Association of South Wales in 1997.<br>
<br>A busy retirement also involved membership of the Economic and Social Research Council (1983&#150;6), and chairmanship of its international activities committee; he had convened the informal group that had successfully approached the chairman of its predecessor body, the Social Science Research Council, in 1966, after geography had been excluded from its original list of disciplines. A much esteemed chairman of the governors of Westhill College of Higher Education, Birmingham&#151;a unique Free Church college&#151;from 1981 to 1995, Steel became president of the Council for Church and Associated Colleges (1990&#150;94). His liberal views on higher education were much valued on the council of the Open University. A Commonwealth visiting fellow at Carleton University, Ottawa, in 1970, and a founder member of the Commonwealth Geographical Bureau (of which he was director from 1972 to 1978), he was chairman of the Commonwealth Human Ecology Council (1988&#150;90), for which he had written a report, <span class="italic">Human Ecology and Hong Kong</span> (1975).<br>
<br>Bethel United Reformed Church in Sketty was a focus for Steel's worship and friendships, and for many activities. Religious commitment extended to national concerns and interdenominational relations, in particular through the United Reformed Forward Policy Group, which he chaired. Christian values were central to his private and public life, and his attitude to people, regardless of status, reflected them. But he was not stuffy or self-righteous; he had a sense of fun and knew how to relax, whether as willing under-gardener to Eileen, or in a shared enjoyment of music.<br>
<br>Steel had a lifelong involvement with British and international geographical organizations and those relating to Africa. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society for over fifty years, he was awarded its Murchison grant in 1948 and was a member of its council (1939&#150;53 and 1968&#150;71). A member of the Institute of British Geographers from 1938, he served on its council from 1947 to 1960, and was its secretary (1948&#150;50), honorary editor (1950&#150;60), and president (1968); he was made an honorary member in 1974, and in 1983 he wrote the institute's history, published for its fiftieth anniversary. A member of the Geographical Association from 1945, he was president in 1973 and an honorary member from 1982. In addition to maintaining his geographical interests in Africa he served on the councils of the universities of Lesotho (1981&#150;6) and Swaziland (1987&#150;91).<br>
<br>Steel's impressive array of honours included four honorary fellowships and five honorary doctorates; he was appointed CBE in 1983. A gentle, modest, steadfast man, he believed that geography, particularly of the peoples of tropical Africa, was a human and humane study. He died of cancer at his home, 12 Cambridge Road, Langland, Swansea, on 29 December 1997 and was survived by his wife, Eileen, and their three children. His funeral service was at the Bethel United Reformed Church, Sketty, on 3 January 1998, and a memorial service was held at St Mary's Church, Swansea, on 24 January.<br>
