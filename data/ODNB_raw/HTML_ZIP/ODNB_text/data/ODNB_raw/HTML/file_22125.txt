<span class="headword">Philips,  Miles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Miguel Perez]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1554), <span class="occ">mariner</span>, can be identified as the son of Robert Gils, merchant of London, and his wife, Anne. In October 1567 Philips sailed from Plymouth as page to John Hawkins in the <i>Jesus of Lubeck</i>, and his experiences during the next fifteen and a half years are chronicled in Hakluyt's <span class="italic">Principall Navigations</span> and in documents from Mexico now in Cambridge University Library. Although there are some minor discrepancies in the evidence, there seems little reason to disbelieve Philips's remarkable story. Hawkins's fleet made for Guinea in west Africa to buy slaves and other merchandise before sailing to the West Indies in February 1568 to trade. In September the ships were forced into the port of San Juan de Ul&uacute;a to repair storm damage and purchase provisions. Hawkins negotiated terms to share the harbour peaceably with the Spanish plate fleet, but the Spaniards broke the agreement and attacked the English ships. Philips escaped in the damaged <i>Minion</i> which became overcrowded with rescued sailors, who were forced to eat hides, cats, dogs, mice, rats, parrots, and monkeys. On 8 October Philips and about one hundred others were put ashore near the River Panuco in Mexico by Hawkins, who promised to fetch them home the following year. Having started to walk along the coast, the sailors were attacked by the Chichimeca Indians who took all their coloured clothing. Philips went westward with a party of men which surrendered to the Spanish at Panuco, and was marched to Mexico City. He spent six months in hospital before being sent to prison in Texcoco. He was released into the household service of a Spanish gentleman, and was subsequently appointed overseer of his master's mine, thereby accumulating much wealth. By this time he was known as Miguel Perez.<br>
<br>By 1572 Philips had returned to Mexico City, where he apprenticed himself to a taffeta weaver. His life changed dramatically when all his goods were seized and he was imprisoned with many fellow Englishmen for interrogation by the Inquisition throughout 1573. Since Philips was too young to have received Catholic instruction in England, he was sentenced in February 1574 to three years' service in a monastery. He was released on 7 May 1577 and resumed his trade as a weaver, but could not leave Mexico City without permission from the Inquisition. When news came of Francis Drake's landing at Guatulco in April 1579, Philips was sent with the Spanish forces as interpreter, hoping in vain that he would fall into English hands. On the next occasion that he was allowed to leave Mexico City on business, he decided to escape, relying on his ability to speak fluent Spanish. He was arrested at Vera Cruz, mistaken for a fugitive Spaniard. Another prisoner identified Philips, who was clapped in irons and sent towards Mexico City. Having managed to take off his shackles and manacles, he fled still wearing a neck collar which was removed for him by Indians. He travelled with a friendly friar to Guatemala, and then hired guides to reach the port of Caballos. From there he sailed to Havana and enlisted as a soldier, leaving for Spain with the plate fleet on 4 June 1582. Philips's deception was uncovered, but he managed to escape at San Lucar before the Inquisition could take him. He travelled to Seville and worked as a silk weaver while being hunted. The master of an English ship at San Lucar refused to take him on board after hearing his story, so Philips went to Puerto de Santa Maria and sailed to Majorca in a Spanish galley. There he secured his passage to England on the <i>Landret</i> by claiming to be a student returning home; he arrived in Poole in February 1583.<br>
<br>Little is known of Philips's life after his early adventures. He must have returned to sea since in January 1587 he was taken on board the <i>Red Dragon</i> at the River Plate by Captain Robert Witherington.<br>
