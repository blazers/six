<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [William the Old]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1168), <span class="occ">bishop of Orkney</span>, is remembered in Orcadian secular and ecclesiastical tradition as the &#145;first bishop&#146; in the Orkneys. The Icelandic lists of the bishops of Orkney all start with him and no previous bishop is mentioned by name in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> (although it states that Earl Thorfinn founded the bishopric at Birsay <i>c</i>.1050 as a seat for the first bishop in the earldom). William is certainly the first who can authoritatively be said to have been resident in the see, and the episcopal seat was moved to Kirkwall by him (following the initiative of Earl Rognvald Kali) where it remained thereafter. His origins are unknown, but that he is unlikely to have been Norwegian is suggested both by his name and by the comment in the saga that he was a &#145;clerk of Paris&#146;. The length of his episcopate is disputed, as the statement in the saga that he was bishop for sixty-six years is generally doubted, but the date of 1102 for his appointment would fit well with the period when the earldom was under the control of King Magnus Barelegs (<i>r</i>. 1093&#150;1103), who at that time dominated the Norwegian colonies in the west and would have been able to choose a cleric from that locality. Certainly William's epithet indicates that he was of great age when he died. It is not known who consecrated William and his rule was not undisputed, as York sources give clear evidence of the appointment of rival candidates and of papal backing for their claims. The divisions among the sons and grandsons of Earl Thorfinn probably helped to create a situation in which rival earls looked to rival bishops. Bishop William's part in the quarrel of Magnus and Hakon is never spelt out in the saga, although it can be deduced that the two were going to attend a peace meeting on the island of Egilsay, where Bishop William is otherwise mentioned as residing, when the final episode of the quarrel resulted in the killing of Magnus by his cousin in 1115 or 1116.<br>
<br>Any part played by Bishop William in these dramatic events had been forgotten, or was deliberately omitted, when the life of St Magnus came to be written down. It is likely that he had been a supporter of Hakon, and the miraculous circumstances in which he is said to have been convinced of the sanctity of the martyred Magnus provides illuminating evidence of clerical adaptation to changed political circumstances as well as evidence of the hagiographer's skill. William then led the move to have Magnus's relics translated to Kirkwall <i>c</i>.1138 and worked with the successful claimant and nephew of Magnus, Rognvald Kali, in the building of the magnificent new cathedral dedicated to his martyred uncle and undoubtedly endowed by the new earl. The fame of the martyred Magnus added lustre and wealth to the Orcadian see, and the bishop participated in another religious phenomenon of the age when he accompanied Earl Rognvald on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land (1151&#150;3). This famous journey forms one of the fullest parts of the saga and Bishop William is said to have captained one of the ships on the outward journey across the Mediterranean, and to have accompanied Rognvald on his return journey overland by way of Rome and Scandinavia. The links between his bishopric and Norway were strengthened in 1153&#150;4, when the papal legate Nicholas Breakspear set up the archbishopric of Trondheim, in which all the sees of the Norwegian colonies were included. William died in 1168 and was buried in the new cathedral of St Magnus in Kirkwall, his tomb being moved into the extended chancel in the thirteenth century, when an inscribed lead plaque (which records the epithet by which he was known) was laid in his coffin.<br>
