<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arundell family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1435&#150;1590), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, constituted an ancient lineage in Cornwall, although their beginnings, which despite claims of Norman ancestry cannot be securely traced back before the early thirteenth century, are obscure. They prospered during the fourteenth century, thanks in part to several well-endowed marriages, and by the end of the fifteenth century had expanded into numerous branches, of which the most important were those based at Lanherne and Trerice. When Sir John [i] Arundell of Lanherne died in 1435 he was wealthy enough to endow a younger son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1445), with property which included Tolverne above the River Fal, thereby founding another branch of the Arundell family. Its members served the crown faithfully in local government during the sixteenth century, despite the mental incapacity of Alexander (1514&#150;1563) and his brother Richard. Alexander's estates were probably worth over &pound;100 when he died. Their great-nephew John (<i>d</i>. 1598) was a son-in-law of the antiquary Richard Carew, and very dear to him. But after John's death his brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1630) sold Tolverne, though the family continued at Truthall near Helston.<h2>
<a name="TheLanhernebranchatitszenith"></a>The Lanherne branch at its zenith</h2>The Lanherne line of Arundells remained pre-eminent into the sixteenth century and its members continued to acquire property until the 1580s. They had continued to add to their properties through marriages. That of Sir John [ii] Arundell (1421&#150;1471&times;3), reputedly the largest free tenant in Cornwall, to Katherine Chideock (<i>d</i>. 1478&times;80) brought him extensive lands in Dorset and Somerset. And their heir, Sir Thomas Arundell (<i>c</i>.1452&#150;1485), who prudently supported the claims of Henry Tudor to the throne after 1483, married Katherine, a sister and coheir of John, Baron Dynham of Cardenham, and so secured a substantial further addition to the family estates after Dynham's death in 1501. Sir Thomas died young, leaving a minor as his heir.<br>
<br>This son, <a name="cosubject_77098"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [iii] Arundell of Lanherne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1474&#150;1545)<span class="occ"></span>, was made a knight of the Bath when Prince Henry was created duke of York in 1494, and led troops both against Cornish rebels in 1497 and to France in 1513, when he was dubbed a knight-banneret. Appointed to the Cornish bench in 1509, he served continually on commissions for the south-west counties. Receiver of the duchy of Cornwall by 1508, he relinquished the position in 1533 to his younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/725/', "Sir Thomas Arundell of Wardour (c.1502&#150;1552)")</script>. By refusing a barony in 1525, Sir John [iii] showed that he recognized the economic demands inherent in such a rank, and he was also unwilling to live at court as he grew older. None the less, in the absence of a resident aristocracy in Cornwall, the Arundells of Lanherne were noble in all but name, and contemporaries called them the &#145;great&#146; Arundells. Sir John's appointment with his son to the council of the west in 1539 reflected the continued importance of the Arundells to the crown, to which they were linked by his marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset. Following her death, about 1503 he married Katherine Grenvile of Stowe (<i>b</i>. 1489&times;93), a match closer to home and requiring a papal dispensation, and suggesting a personal choice rather than a strategic alliance. She survived him.<br>
<br>A devoted family man and considerate of his spiritual life, Sir John [iii] Arundell founded a chantry at St Mawgan and entrusted his children to Katherine's care before embarking with troops to France in 1513. A decade later, he cared for his daughter-in-law, left abandoned and pregnant in London when financial embarrassment caused her husband, his son and heir, John, to flee temporarily to the continent. His second son, Thomas, engaged in negotiations for the marriages of two of his sisters who were serving Queen Jane Seymour in 1536. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/723/', "Mary Arundell (d. 1557)")</script> married Robert Radcliffe, earl of Sussex, and Thomas Cromwell proposed the marriage of her half-sister Jane (<i>d</i>. 1577) to his own son Gregory. However, Jane never married, and her father provided her with substantial support for life. A gentlewoman in Queen Mary's household, she returned eventually to Lanherne and is commemorated in St Mawgan church. Cromwell's failure to base his family's dynastic aspirations upon an Arundell alliance is unsurprising. The confraternal association of the Lanherne family with the Carthusians reflected deep piety and devotion to traditional religion. Religious change in England marked a turning point for them, although their enormous wealth enabled them to survive the difficulties brought upon them by their spiritual loyalties during the sixteenth century. Sir John [iii] died on 8 February 1545, possessed of substantial properties which included nearly 6000 acres in Devon alone and with lands in Devon and Cornwall valued at nearly &pound;400. Buried at St Columb Major on 20 February, he had spent the last years of his life, and died, at the home of his nephew, Richard Roscarrock of Roscarrock in St Endellion parish, also an opponent of religious change.<h2>
<a name="DeclineofthegreatArundells"></a>Decline of the great Arundells</h2>
<a name="cosubject_77099"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [iv] Arundell of Lanherne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1557)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father, was the elder son of the latter's first marriage. In 1516 he married Mary, daughter of Sir Peter Edgcumbe of Cotehele (<i>c</i>.1469&#150;1539) and Joan Dernford; at the same time his sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1516&times;24) married Sir Peter's heir, Richard (<i>d</i>. 1562). Mary had died by 1527, and her husband's twelve children were born of his second marriage, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1564), daughter of the courtier Gerard Dannett. Appointed to the Cornish and Devon benches in the 1530s, and sheriff of Cornwall in 1541&#150;2, Arundell was knighted in 1539. In 1536 he commanded a body of Devon militia against the Pilgrimage of Grace, and he went with the army to France in 1544. His life changed dramatically in 1549, however, when the privy council summoned him to answer charges brought by John, Baron Russell, the commander of the royal army against the western rising. Accused of refusing to raise militia and illegally ordering the performance of masses, Arundell claimed he had been without authority in a region far from home. His absence, although convenient, is substantiated in the council's records, and prudence may have dictated his ordering masses in a crisis as a way of promoting calm. But at this time the importance of the &#145;great&#146; Arundells worked against them, in a climate of crisis governed by suspicion, intrigue, and fear, and their safety was also compromised by their being brothers-in-law of the earl of Arundell and the Howards, and cousins of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/717/', "Humphrey Arundell (1512/13&#150;1550)")</script>, a leader of the Cornish rebels. After repeated imprisonment and his brother Thomas's execution, Sir John was released in June 1552. He could have expected to prosper after the accession of Mary in the following year, but although he was both sheriff and a knight of the shire in 1554, his service to the new queen was short-lived. He died intestate on 7 November 1557, and his widow was granted administration of his possessions. The devotion of Elizabeth, Lady Arundell, to traditional religion and erudition reflected that of her husband, his family, and her children, as is evident in their wills, and in the library she inherited from her husband. Husband and wife were buried at St Mawgan, as were some of their children.<br>
<br>The heir of Lanherne, <a name="cosubject_77100"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [v] Arundell</span>  (1527<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;1590)<span class="occ"></span>, was the last of the &#145;great&#146; Arundells&#151;the result of what became an open commitment to Catholicism against the background of both the Elizabethan religious settlement and constant threats of invasion from Spain. His election as MP for Helston in 1545 and then for Shaftesbury in 1547 undoubtedly resulted from the influence of his uncle, Sir Thomas Arundell of Wardour. The patronage of his future father-in-law, the third earl of Derby, probably secured his election for Preston in 1555, but his recent succession to his father did most to bring him election for Cornwall in 1558. Esquire of the body to Queen Mary and her husband by 1558, he served on muster, subsidy, and piracy commissions between 1558 and 1566, and was appointed to the Cornish bench in 1569, when he also co-commanded the county muster at the time of the northern rising. In 1571 he was recorder of Helston and steward of the seventeenth earl of Oxford's west country lands, some of which he purchased.<br>
<br>Recognizing that Arundell did not sympathize with its religious policy, in 1562 the government excluded him from service on assizes. Bishop Alley's report of two years later on the stance of the leading men of his diocese likewise named him as an opponent. His being knighted in 1566 and his continuing to hold public offices probably represented attempts to persuade him to conformity at this time. He declined to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1570, but a recognizance was quickly discharged since his loyalty to the queen was evident. But when Cuthbert Mayne, the first seminary priest to be executed, praised Sir John from the scaffold at Launceston on 30 November 1577, the government would no longer tolerate his refusal to accept the Elizabethan settlement, and thereafter he came under constant pressure. Vulnerable as a recusant to accusations of disloyalty, Sir John suffered repeated imprisonment, fines, and enforced residence in London for the remainder of his life, despite his public declaration both of his loyalty to the queen and of his willingness to defend her and the realm against the pope. He died at Isleworth, Middlesex, on 17 November 1590, but was buried at St Columb Major on 6 December following. In his will, drawn up on 12 December 1589, Arundell made no attempt to conceal his Catholicism, bequeathing his soul to the mercy of God and &#145;the intercession and mediation of our Blessed Ladie the holie Virgin Marie and of the holie Aungelles Saintes and the blessed company of heaven&#146;. His executor and residuary legatee was his son, another John Arundell, who was urged to make his own will forthwith, &#145;that he die not intestate whereby my goodes and chattells may come into straungers handes&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/76, fol. 290<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). Sir John's largest single bequest was of &pound;100 to his wife, Anne, daughter of Edward Stanley, third earl of Derby, and widow of Charles, eighth Baron Stourton. The mother of Arundell's eight children, after his death she retired to the manor of Chideock, Dorset, but when she died in 1602 was buried beside him at St Columb Major. In 1599 two of their daughters, Dorothy and Gertrude, became Benedictine nuns in the first English convent on the continent, founded at Brussels.<br>
<br>Traditional religion continued at Lanherne, however, for in 1794 Lord and Lady Arundell of Wardour gave the house to English Carmelites fleeing the French invasion of Flanders, and they retained it until 2001. It is now a convent for Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate, and retains a significant relic, a skull believed to be that of St Cuthbert Mayne.<h2>
<a name="TheTrericebranch"></a>The Trerice branch</h2>The sixteenth-century Arundells of Trerice did not share the religious traditionalism of their Lanherne cousins. They too prospered in the late fifteenth century through their services to the crown, under both Edward IV and Henry VII. In the latter's reign Sir John [vi] Arundell of Trerice (<i>d</i>. 1511) linked the two lines when he married Jane Grenvile of Stowe (<i>d</i>. 1552), sister of the Katherine Grenvile who married Sir John [iii] Arundell of Lanherne. The outstanding member of the family was their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_721"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [vii] Arundell of Trerice</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1560)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Efford near Bude. His first wife, Mary Beville, was the heir of Gwarnack where he lived for a time, before returning in the 1550s to live at Efford. His second wife was Juliana, widow of a man named Gourlyn and daughter of James Erisey of Erisey. He had an illegitimate son, Robert of Menadarva, together with eight children from his two marriages. A contentious and lively figure, he enhanced the family fortunes by his marriages, service to four monarchs, and economic ventures such as shipping hides to the continent for sale to his uncle Viscount Lisle, the governor of Calais. Summoned to the reception of the emperor Charles V in 1520, he earned the king's praise three years later for capturing a Scottish pirate in a sea battle, while in 1537 he confronted Spanish ships which were attempting to pursue French men-of-war up the Truro River. In 1542 he was knighted and made vice-admiral of the west for the future Edward VI, who rewarded him with lands and goods for his service against rebels. Appointed to the Cornish bench in 1530, he was sheriff three times under Henry VIII and Mary. He investigated discontent in Cornwall with the latter's religious policies, mustered troops in case of invasion, and prepared to entertain Philip of Spain <i>en route</i> for his marriage. At his death, on 25 or 26 November 1560, Sir John held over 10,000 acres in Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset, and bequeathed over &pound;800 to his daughters. An engraved tomb brass depicting him with his wives and children marks his burial at St Andrew's Church, Stratton, near Efford.<br>
<br>Sir John Arundell of Trerice was predeceased by his eldest son, Roger, and this gave rise to problems of inheritance. Sir John was succeeded by his grandson John [viii] Arundell of Gwarnack (1557&#150;1613), an infant whose wardship was held by Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel. However, a son from Sir John's second marriage, <a name="cosubject_77101"></a><span class="headword">John [ix] Arundell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580)<span class="occ"></span>, eventually inherited the Trerice name together with difficulties arising from a split inheritance that were resolved only in 1598, eighteen years after his death. Notwithstanding these problems, the master of Trerice was a wealthy man whose landownership in the south-western counties increased through the inheritance of his first wife, Katherine Hill, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cosworth. Though he was MP for Mitchell in 1555 and 1558, and sheriff of Cornwall in 1573&#150;4, John [ix] Arundell was less active in local and national affairs than his father had been, and in the eyes of posterity his most important achievement was the rebuilding of Trerice House (now owned by the National Trust). It is an excellent example of an Elizabethan manor house, with fine plasterwork and a continental gable design that may be unique for its period. Described by his son-in-law Richard Carew as a kind and loving man, these qualities also appear in his will, with its careful provision not only for his children (his daughters were to have &pound;1200) but also for numerous servants, as well as for the neighbouring poor and for the repair of Wade Bridge. His heir, John [x] Arundell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/722/', "Arundell, Sir John (1576&#150;1654x)")</script>], was his son from his second marriage, which was to Gertrude Denys; anecdotally called John for the king, this John Arundell eventually inherited the Gwarnack properties. John [x] Arundell's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/724/', "Richard Arundel (1616&#150;1687)")</script> was created Baron Arundell of Trerice in 1665. The title became extinct in 1768 with the death of another John, the fourth baron, and the Trerice estates eventually passed to the Acland family. Richard's sister Anne (<i>d</i>. 1701), married Sir John Arundell of Lanherne (1623&#150;1701), but died childless. Sir John's great-granddaughter, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1769), married Henry, seventh Baron Arundell of Wardour (1717&#150;1756), thus reuniting the Lanherne Arundell lands.<br>
