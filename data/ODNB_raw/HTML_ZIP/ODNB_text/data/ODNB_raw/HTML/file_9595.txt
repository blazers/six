</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzGibbon,  John</span>, first earl of Clare  (1748&#150;1802), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was born in Donnybrook, co. Dublin, the youngest son of John FitzGibbon (1708&#150;1780), lawyer and Irish MP for Newcastle, co. Dublin, and Elinor Grove (<i>d</i>. 1786), daughter of John Grove of Ballyhimock, co. Cork.<h2>
<a name="Familybackground"></a>Family background</h2>Many of FitzGibbon's enemies jeered at his supposed descent from Catholic peasants. While FitzGibbon's ancestors were indeed Catholic, they were at once loftier and more pathetic than his enemies claimed: minor gentry convinced that they had unjustly lost splendid wealth. FitzGibbon's cousin insisted that the family had lost an estate worth thousands of pounds because of their ancestor's refusal to betray his Catholic religion. In the duller realm of documented fact the FitzGibbons appear to have been doctors and gentlemen farmers.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon's father initially followed the family profession of medicine. After a brief stint in Paris as a medical student he decided that he would get nowhere as an obscure Catholic physician. He conformed in 1732 and took up study of the law. The elder FitzGibbon was phenomenally successful in his profession, leaving an estate worth &pound;100,000. Not surprisingly his surviving cases usually involved disputes between Catholics and their converted relatives.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon's enemies often held up this hardened opportunist as a model of simple virtue. Edmund Burke, who loathed John the son, proudly claimed kinship with John the father, praising him as a &#145;good Irishman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 7.192), tragically torn between sympathy for his &#145;blood&#146;  (ibid.), the Irish Catholics, and his ambitions for his family. FitzGibbon senior apparently did retain some residual sympathy for the Catholic Ireland he had left behind. William Gerard Hamilton implied that attacks on King William always amused the elder FitzGibbon, &#145;who is a Papist&#146;  (Hutchinson papers, TCD, C/1/16, 29). But he placed far greater faith in two secular gods: money and the rapid social elevation of his family. He could acquire both only by submitting to the dominant English and protestant order. This insight was the father's most enduring legacy to his son.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>The reliable facts about the younger FitzGibbon's early life are sketchy. His three elder brothers died young, though his sisters all survived to adulthood. The eldest, Arabella, married St John Jeffereyes and became the chatelaine of Blarney Castle in co. Cork. Elizabeth married William Beresford, brother of John Beresford and son of the earl of Tyrone. Elinor, the youngest, became the wife of Dominic Trant. Trant, like FitzGibbon, was the son of a convert and a loyal supporter of government. Elizabeth provided FitzGibbon with a major political advantage by marrying into one of the most powerful families in Ireland. He also had a reasonably good relationship with Elinor, but Arabella he eventually came to detest and disinherit. Her eccentric radicalism and her improvidence made her a lifelong source of trouble.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 6 June 1763 as a fellow-commoner, and obtained his BA in 1766. In that same year he seems to have entered Christ Church, Oxford, but he was not incorporated until 7 June 1769, and proceeded MA on 9 May 1770. As was the standard practice for Irish barristers at the time FitzGibbon received legal training both in Ireland and in England. In Trinity term 1767 he entered the Middle Temple in London, and in 1772 was admitted to the degree of barrister-at-law by the King's Inns in Dublin.<br>
<br>According to legend his most exacting legal training came from his father. None the less FitzGibbon's own experience probably had an equally important influence in his professional development. He acquired an especially keen understanding of the complexities of Irish property law, a great asset when he became lord chancellor.<h2>
<a name="Earlyparliamentarycareer17781780"></a>Early parliamentary career, 1778&#150;1780</h2>FitzGibbon made his first step in public life in March 1778 when he was elected member for Trinity College, Dublin, in the Irish parliament. He had been elected at a by-election after the expulsion of Richard Hely-Hutchinson, the son of John Hely-Hutchinson, the unpopular provost of Trinity widely regarded as a placeman. FitzGibbon presented himself to the electors as an opponent of jobbery, and once in the Commons he maintained the role of friend of the people, at that time the surest strategy for political advancement. Encouraged by the progress of the American War of Independence, the patriot party, under the leadership of Henry Grattan, were demanding the repeal of Poynings' law, which denied the Irish parliament the right to introduce or revise bills, and vested most legislative power in the British or Irish privy councils. They also called for an end to the power of the British House of Lords to judge Irish cases on appeal and a repeal of the so-called <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>, which gave the British parliament the right to legislate on behalf of Ireland. Under ordinary circumstances the government probably would have ignored or bribed Grattan and his friends, but the American war prevented the government taking action.<br>
<br>In one of his first speeches in the Commons, FitzGibbon, true to patriot form, accused the sheriff of Kilkenny of withholding election returns, thereby violating the rights of the electors, who of course wanted to know the outcome. FitzGibbon's speech displayed many of the qualities that would characterize his political career: savage indignation against perceived injustice, and still more savage demands for punishment.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon's opposition to the first major Catholic relief bill of 1778 was perfectly in keeping with patriotic sentiments. In the view of the patriots, government support for the bill offered enough reason to oppose it. Any favour shown to the Catholics, however minor, favoured despotism and bigotry. FitzGibbon especially opposed the repeal of two major penal restrictions: giving a conforming son the right to immediate ownership of all property, thus making a father and other siblings tenants for life and continued division of an estate into equal portions if none of the children conformed.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon did not act solely for partisan motives. He had always hated violations of the rights of property, even Catholic property, and he favoured limited rights of purchase. But the bill offered no rights of outright ownership, only a tenancy for a fabulous maximum of 999 years. In his view such tenancies were liable to seizure for the most trivial reasons. Unfortunately the final act included everything FitzGibbon had objected to both as a zealous protestant and as a careful lawyer.<br>
<br>In spite of his growing reputation as an opponent of government FitzGibbon soon recognized that patriotism could offer only fleeting popularity. The government, even at its nadir, conferred the more substantial reward of office. His instincts were right, though the pay-off was frustratingly slow. In November 1779 his relative John Beresford, one of the few remaining supporters of the beleaguered lord lieutenant, John Hobart, second earl of Buckinghamshire, promised FitzGibbon whichever of the offices of prime serjeant, solicitor-general, or attorney-general should first become vacant if he would oppose the latest patriot initiative. The opposition wanted parliament to refuse the usual two-year grant of supply to the government, granting funds only for a six-month period, unless Ireland received unrestricted access to Britain's West Indian trade. Negotiations broke down when the government succumbed to pressure from the patriots, conceding the six-month supply; the ministry in Britain then conceded the patriots' commercial demands. Beresford probably won FitzGibbon over not only by the prospect of office, but by playing on his fears of an uprising by the dispossessed Catholics against the propertied protestants, who would render meaningless the struggles of FitzGibbon's father. From 1780 FitzGibbon opposed most major patriot measures, including Grattan's famous resolution asserting the autonomy of the Irish parliament, and the 1780 <span class="roman">Tenantry Act</span>, which in confirming tenants in abeyant life leases, seemed to him to overturn the fundamental rights of landlords in their property. He did, however, oppose the British government's amendments to the <span class="roman">Mutiny Bill</span> of 1780, believing that it placed Ireland under permanent military government and curtailed the freedom of Irish protestants.<br>
<br>Yet another opportunity arose in 1781, with the advent of the administration of Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle. FitzGibbon became lifelong friends with Carlisle's chief secretary, William Eden. With Eden's encouragement he continued to oppose any new efforts to attain Irish autonomy. In the area of trade he resisted Irish efforts to retaliate against Portugal for alleged trade violations after it seized Irish woollen goods in August 1781. In debates in the Commons during February 1782 he took the reasonable, if unpopular, view that Ireland was not in a position to force Portugal to accept unwanted woollen goods and that the British ministers in London, rightly, should handle any such grievances. He also lent his support to a second Catholic relief bill, sponsored by the government, in 1782, although he did express reservations over the possibility that Catholic landowners could wield electoral influence. Thanks to Catholic loyalty during a threatened French invasion the bill received widespread support and quickly passed into law. In FitzGibbon's view the new act, especially the freedom to purchase property, satisfied all reasonable Catholic grievances.<br>
<br>The favour of the Carlisle administration, and the renewed promise of office, ended in 1782 when Carlisle was recalled at the fall of the North ministry. The new Rockingham administration appointed William Bentinck, third duke of Portland, in his place. FitzGibbon felt no loyalty to this new administration. On the contrary he wanted to avenge his friend Eden, who had been dismissed along with Carlisle. He immediately assumed a place as one of the most violent supporters of Irish autonomy. Portland, faced with a revitalized Irish opposition, reinforced by FitzGibbon and other former supporters of government, agreed to the repeal of Poynings' law and the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> of 1719, measures carried through by his successor, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, third Earl Temple.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon's career received a set-back in summer 1783 when he lost his Commons seat at Trinity College. In August he stood for co. Limerick, but despite furious electioneering and the help of relatives and legal connections he could not prevail. One of his clients, Silver Oliver, then offered him the pocket borough of Kilmallock, co. Limerick, where he remained for the rest of his career in the Commons. FitzGibbon's support for Irish autonomy revived his friendship with Henry Grattan and finally won him the office he had sought for over four years. With Grattan's support FitzGibbon was nominated by the Fox&#150;North coalition's lord lieutenant, Robert Henley, second earl of Northington, for the vacant office of attorney-general. Not surprisingly Charles James Fox felt some doubts about appointing a former enemy as the government's chief law officer, but Grattan had assured Northington that FitzGibbon had behaved honourably in 1782 and deserved the appointment. Fox reluctantly agreed and in November 1783 FitzGibbon became attorney-general of Ireland. As Grattan himself later acknowledged, he made a fatal misjudgement.<h2>
<a name="Attorneygeneral17841789"></a>Attorney-general, 1784&#150;1789</h2>Soon after the appointment of FitzGibbon the Fox&#150;North coalition fell and William Pitt the younger appointed the 29-year-old Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, lord lieutenant. The two established a relationship based on FitzGibbon's admiration for the British ruling &eacute;lite and Rutland's almost filial regard for him, even though they were only a few years apart; FitzGibbon would enjoy a similar relationship with the earl of Westmorland.<br>
<br>Continued pressure for reform came, by spring 1784, to centre on demands for parliamentary reform. For many patriots in the Commons this was a step too far, and leadership passed to a group of Dublin tradesmen and professionals. They formulated a plan to establish a congress made up of electors who would draw up a plan of reform and present it to parliament. However peaceful its intentions the campaign inevitably provoked the government's fears. Government members sat for many of the unreformed boroughs. Worse, some reformers briefly considered Catholic participation in this newly reformed parliament. Above all the movement had strong support in Dublin, the centre of political agitation in Ireland.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon, in common with other members of the Irish administration, suspected a French sponsored conspiracy of Catholics and Presbyterians which would lead to a republic. When it became clear that many sheriffs had agreed to hold the elections to the congress he threatened the Dublin sheriffs with prosecution if they followed suit. FitzGibbon managed to intimidate the city sheriffs into passivity, but he was less successful with the sheriff of co. Dublin, Stephen Reily. When FitzGibbon arrived in person to stop elections taking place on 21 September 1784 Reily was idolized by the radicals as a constitutional hero; FitzGibbon indicted him for summoning an illegal and seditious assembly. FitzGibbon chose to proceed against Reily by attachment, a legal device by which an attorney-general could lay a complaint before a panel of judges who would then determine the merits of the case. The point was, of course, to avoid the terrible possibility of an acquittal by a Dublin jury.<br>
<br>The opposition newspapers responded with a virulence extraordinary even for the eighteenth-century Irish press. They portrayed FitzGibbon as an incompetent lawyer, an avid reader of French pornography, and a callous seducer of innocent women. More seriously the recorder of Dublin, Samuel Bradstreet, one of Reily's prospective judges, raised doubts about the legality of attachments. In the end the judges, including a converted Bradstreet, found Reily guilty.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon's later career had occasional set-backs. In 1785 a revived opposition resisted a bill creating a commercial union with England on the grounds that the measure struck a blow against Irish autonomy. FitzGibbon responded that Ireland would in fact share the benefits of the English navigation laws; by contrast, rejection of the bill would exclude Ireland from the British commercial system and wreak havoc on Ireland's economy. He pointed out that opponents of the measure, such as Henry Flood, had once supported free trade with Britain and her colonies. In anger, he described his countrymen as a &#145;besotted nation&#146;  (Kavanaugh, 92), implying that reason had been overturned by the patriots' belief in independence at any price. The bill passed, but by such a small majority that Rutland abandoned it.<br>
<br>Other aspects of FitzGibbon's career as attorney-general were more rewarding. In 1786 he travelled to co. Mayo, where he successfully prosecuted George &#145;Fighting&#146; Fitzgerald for murder, and also that year successfully carried the <span class="roman">Dublin Police Act</span> through the Commons, ably manipulating the fear shared by many Irish protestant gentlemen that public order was on the verge of breakdown to give the government wide powers to search houses and seize arms in private hands, as well as limiting the opening hours of public houses.<br>
<br>One of FitzGibbon's most serious challenges came with the revival of the Whiteboy movement, which re-emerged from late 1784. The Whiteboys sought to seize control of parishes and enforce the reduction of tithes paid to the Church of Ireland, and in this incarnation acted with greater organization and discipline than before. Although the Whiteboys were Catholic they received encouragement from some protestant landlords with their own personal or political grudges against the established church. FitzGibbon's eldest sister, Arabella Jeffereyes, was a prominent supporter, herself playing a part in the setting of tithes and recruiting Whiteboys to help drain a lake on her estate.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon overcame his sympathy for the rural poor and in February 1787 introduced a bill for the flogging, hanging, or transporting of convicted active Whiteboys. Initially it also included a clause calling for the destruction of Catholic chapels used for Whiteboy meetings. The majority of his fellow members recoiled from this particular assertion of protestant supremacy and demanded its withdrawal. FitzGibbon reluctantly agreed, and the revised bill passed with its more secular terrors intact. The fact that some Whiteboys had started to demand reductions in rents as well as tithes undermined much of their former support among landlords, including Mrs Jeffereyes. FitzGibbon sought to secure public order by extending the provisions of the <span class="roman">Dublin Police Act</span> to the rest of Ireland, but the proposed measures placed too great a burden on the time and finances of the country gentlemen, and very few counties took advantage of the act.<br>
<br>As his opposition to the Whiteboys had distanced FitzGibbon from his father's Catholic background, so did his marriage, on 1 July 1786, at St Stephen's Green, Dublin, to Anne Whaley or Whalley (<i>d</i>. 1844), sister of the infamous gambler <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29156/', "Thomas Whaley")</script>, and daughter of Richard Chapel Whaley (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1769) and his second wife, Anne Ward (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1741). The Whaleys were a well-established protestant family from co. Wicklow, and Anne's father had been known as Burn Chapel Whaley from his alleged pastime of destroying Catholic places of worship by arson. Anne was recognized as one of the most elegant ladies in Dublin society, and was undoubtedly an asset to the socially uncultivated FitzGibbon. They had five children, although their two eldest daughters both died of smallpox in childhood. Anne would often be accused of adultery during their marriage, but if this was true FitzGibbon seems to have excused her on the grounds that he neglected her in favour of his career.<br>
<br>The regency crisis of 1788&#150;9 almost ended FitzGibbon's career. Late in 1788 George III became incapacitated by insanity. The Irish opposition, guided by their English whig friends, agitated for the immediate transfer of the regency in Ireland to George, prince of Wales. While for the whigs in London this was their opportunity to form the ministry, for the Irish opposition this was a means of establishing the constitutional separation between Ireland and Great Britain. The lord lieutenant, the marquess of Buckingham (formerly Earl Temple), was convinced that the victory of the prince and the whigs was almost inevitable; many government supporters shared his view and defected to the opposition. FitzGibbon stood practically alone in opposing any independent action on the part of the Irish parliament. When Grattan moved for an unrestricted regency in the Commons, on 11 February 1789, FitzGibbon was almost the only speaker to oppose him. He eloquently repeated his lifelong article of faith: the crown was the sole, unifying link between Ireland and Great Britain, and the sole protection for Irish protestants. They could maintain this link only by choosing the same regent as the English parliament. Following the king's recovery his political virtue was rewarded. Buckingham recognized his loyalty, proved again by his rapid moves to reconcile the defectors to the government, by persuading Pitt that FitzGibbon was the only possible lord chancellor in succession to James Hewitt, Viscount Lifford; the appointment was made public on 13 June, and on 6 July FitzGibbon was created a peer as Baron FitzGibbon of Lower Connello, co. Limerick.<h2>
<a name="Careeraslordchancellor"></a>Career as lord chancellor</h2>FitzGibbon's love of show as lord chancellor provided ammunition for his enemies. He commissioned a sumptuous state coach from English craftsmen, opening himself to the charges of excessive vanity and a lack of patriotism; his defenders said he was setting a good example to Irish craftsmen. Even his worst detractors, however, had to admit his abilities as a judge. The nineteenth-century legal historian J. F. O'Flanagan best expressed the general consensus: FitzGibbon &#145;reformed abuses with no niggard hand and purged the court of much that called for reform&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 2.280).<br>
<br>Most of his recorded chancery decisions show a powerful grasp of the complexities of chancery law, a comprehensive knowledge of Irish life, and constant compassion for the poor. FitzGibbon also had a gift for narrative. Legal literature is often difficult for lawyers, and baffling to lay people, but FitzGibbon's decisions are vividly written and mercifully devoid of jargon.<br>
<br>In contrast with his conduct in parliament he showed a striking favour toward Catholics. He acted out of the same desire to expiate past injustices that moved him in 1782. FitzGibbon especially resisted efforts by protestant relatives to seize Catholic property, because of past evasions of the penal laws. He demanded a strict standard of proof in all cases, and in most of them he decided in favour of the Catholic party, such as in <i>Barnewall v. Barnewall</i>  (Ridgeway, 3.24&#150;79).<br>
<br>His decision in <i>Kiely v. Monck</i>  (Ridgeway, 3.206&#150;66) best illustrates his general compassion for the weak and hard-pressed. Ann Kiely, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Monck, disputed a provision in her father's will which denied her a legacy unless she married a man with a freehold estate worth at least &pound;500, free of all encumbrances. Her husband, while perfectly respectable, did not meet the late Mr Monck's financial specifications. For this reason Ann's brother denied her the legacy, worth &pound;1800. To FitzGibbon's mind this provision was both cruel and unreasonable. Few men, he argued, even the wealthiest, could meet this qualification. As a result, this &#145;weak old man&#146;, Ann's father, had virtually condemned his daughter to spinsterhood. His action clearly violated legal precedents prohibiting undue restraints on marriage.<br>
<br>FitzGibbon prided himself, above all, on his integrity as a judge. When Edward Strafford, second earl of Aldborough, a fellow peer and disappointed suitor, dared to suggest, in a 1797 pamphlet, that he had behaved corruptly in his court FitzGibbon responded with frightening vindictiveness. Aldborough endured a humiliating trial in the House of Lords and six weeks in prison.<h2>
<a name="CatholicreliefandtheUnitedIrishmen"></a>Catholic relief and the United Irishmen</h2>The French Revolution of 1789 led to renewed support for political reform in Ireland. FitzGibbon was naturally opposed to any alteration to the constitutional settlement. When the Catholic committee of Dublin resolved, in February 1791, to petition the government for further relief he impressed upon the lord lieutenant, John Fane, tenth earl of Westmorland, that the increase in activity by the armed Catholic society, the Defenders, and the expressions of goodwill towards Catholics made by the radical United Irishmen, made any further concessions towards Catholics highly dangerous to the protestant and British interest. Rebuffed by Westmorland, the Catholic committee opened up their own channels of communication with William Pitt's government, which had already supported an English Catholic relief act that year. Pitt persuaded Westmorland to introduce an Irish Catholic relief bill that opened the bar to Catholics and removed restrictions on education and intermarriage, but FitzGibbon and his allies prevented the introduction of the right to serve on juries or carry weapons. The bill passed at the beginning of 1792.<br>
<br>The act failed to meet Catholic expectations, and the committee leaders, who now retained the protestant lawyer and United Irishman Wolfe Tone as their secretary, organized elections to a Catholic convention. FitzGibbon organized a meeting of protestant freeholders in co. Limerick in the summer, in the hope that it and similar meetings would deter the Catholics from establishing what was feared would become a parallel Catholic Irish parliament. He was frustrated by what he saw as British na&iuml;vety and inactivity: where FitzGibbon wanted to expand the regular army, raise a protestant militia, and introduce legislation to ban meetings of elected delegates, Pitt believed that by granting all political rights short of holding office he would ensure the loyalty of Catholic Ireland during the coming war with France. Despite their close links with the United Irishmen the Catholic convention, when it met in November 1792, refused to receive a delegation from them and, far from raising its own army, stressed its loyalty to the crown. At the same time it insulted the Irish government by presenting its petition to George III directly. The delegation was warmly received by the king and Pitt, who ordered a further relief bill. FitzGibbon dutifully managed the passage of the bill through the Lords, but showed his true sympathies on 10 January 1793 in his speech to the Lords, in which he gave a comprehensive history of Catholic treachery and argued that the Catholics aimed at secular and religious tyranny; the consequence of the bill's passage would be the retreat of reason and the transformation of Ireland into a Catholic state hostile to protestantism and Britain. He was mocked by several bishops, but the speech reflected protestant fears, was published, and was regularly reprinted by opponents of Catholic emancipation. Meanwhile, he learned that Pitt, in the medium term, sought a union of Great Britain and Ireland, and became convinced that only this could preserve protestant authority.<br>
<br>While FitzGibbon could not prevent the Catholic concessions of 1793 he did succeed in eliminating conventions, their successful political tool. His <span class="roman">Convention Act</span> forbade the election of any extra-parliamentary groups &#145;under pretence of preparing or presenting public petitions&#146; (33 Geo. III c. 29; <span class="italic">Irish Statutes</span>, 16.794). He was not only getting retrograde revenge on the Catholics, he was thwarting their allies, the United Irishmen, whom he suspected of co-ordinating riots during that year, and who were planning to organize a similar convention to press for parliamentary reform. A year later, in 1794, the United Irish organization was banned. Meanwhile FitzGibbon's enthusiastic support of the protestant interest had brought him a promotion in the peerage, to Viscount FitzGibbon of Limerick, in December 1793.<h2>
<a name="RevolutionaryIreland"></a>Revolutionary Ireland</h2>In January 1795, a new lord lieutenant, William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, fourth Earl Fitzwilliam, arrived in Ireland, intent on repealing all remaining Catholic disabilities. He was dismissed within three months, thanks largely to his own bad judgement. He had ignored repeated cautions from London not to raise Catholic issues so soon after the concessions of 1793. While he had been informed in no uncertain terms to leave FitzGibbon alone he engaged in a ruthless purge of other loyal servants of the British government whom he considered unfavourable to his political views. FitzGibbon's position as the leader of an unchallengeable protestant party in parliament has been exaggerated in 1795 and subsequently; in fact he was conscious that a hostile lord lieutenant made his position vulnerable, and fell back on pressing a union on Fitzwilliam as the best means of maintaining protestant supremacy.<br>
<br>Later Fitzwilliam and his supporters, especially Grattan, attributed the dismissal to FitzGibbon. Supposedly he had turned the once favourable king against the Catholics. FitzGibbon did indeed inform George III in 1795 that further concessions to Catholics would betray his coronation oath to defend the protestant establishment in church and state, but the king's education, temperament, and prejudices had already led him to decide that he could not agree to further Catholic demands. FitzGibbon's emphasis on the coronation oath simply confirmed him in his own inclinations. The Fitzwilliam episode confirmed FitzGibbon's ascendancy over most shades of opinion in the Irish parliament. To the British government he had made himself indispensable as a manager and interpreter of Irish politics. On the recommendation of Fitzwilliam's successor, John Jeffreys Pratt, second Earl Camden, he was created earl of Clare on 12 June 1795.<br>
<br>Even if Fitzwilliam had remained in Ireland he probably would have failed to restore peace. The banned United Irishmen were now a revolutionary organization in contact with the French, and in an uneasy alliance with the Defenders. Clare viewed the rebels as a disciplined revolutionary hierarchy, the United Irishmen directing their Catholic allies, and he responded to their threats in his usual fashion. In 1795 he turned areas of Defender activity over to the punishment of martial law. According to his own admission he encouraged the disarmament of revolutionary Ulster in 1797. He had been vice-chancellor of Trinity College since 1791, and used the post to purge undergraduates with United Irish sympathies, most dramatically in April 1798 when nineteen students were expelled, including Robert Emmet.<br>
<br>None the less, in the wake of the rebellion of 1798 Clare was the strongest advocate of clemency. Following the capture of the United Irish directory in Dublin in March 1798 he offered exile in return for testimony before parliament. He also played a major role in drafting a general pardon for rebels. Exceptions included United Irish political or military officers, and anyone found guilty of murder or conspiracy to commit murder, but even these individuals were given time to go into exile before the law took effect. His motive was always the same: better discredited and exiled rebels than martyrs to inspire later revolutions.<br>
<br>Towards condemned rebels his conduct varied. He accompanied Lady Louisa Conolly to the deathbed of her nephew, Lord Edward Fitzgerald. Pity for Lady Louisa, a beloved friend, probably influenced him more than any feeling for Lord Edward. He took a harsher view of Wolfe Tone, by 1798 a captured rebel. When Tone attempted suicide by cutting his own throat Clare fretted over the decision to give him a respite. In his opinion Tone should have been hanged, even with a severed throat.<h2>
<a name="ActofUnion"></a>Act of Union</h2>Clare was often accused of having engineered the rebellion of 1798 for his end of forcing union with Great Britain on Ireland, but to Clare the rebellion was an inevitability which he did his best to prevent. He viewed Irish history as a cycle of violent uprisings against the English or protestant interest; a union with Britain would make the Irish Catholics a minority and confirm the protestant character of the state. The strong pro-union majority in the House of Lords meant that Clare played no part in the squalid campaign of bribery that the chief secretary, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, and the lord lieutenant, Charles, first Marquess Cornwallis, embarked on in the Commons, and they were careful to separate him from charges of corruption by making him a British peer, as Baron FitzGibbon of Sidbury, Devon, in September 1799, in advance of the large number of new peerages promised in return for votes. Clare assumed the role of chief propagandist for the measure, most notably in his great speech of 1800 to his fellow peers. With extraordinary eloquence, he reviewed his lifelong version of Irish history: feckless protestants who dabbled in political reform while their embittered Catholic subjects, &#145;brooding on their wrongs in sullen discontent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speech &hellip; 10 February, 1800</span>, 22), sought their chance to raise a savage rebellion in the tradition of 1641. Only the union could compel the protestants to abandon political fantasy and assume their true responsibilities: &#145;taming and civilizing&#146;  (ibid., 84) the barbarous Catholics by living on their estates and introducing much needed improvements.<h2>
<a name="CareerintheUnitedKingdom"></a>Career in the United Kingdom</h2>Clare soon found himself resenting the union he had supported so wholeheartedly. His resentment arose from political negotiations involving Cornwallis, and two old nemeses, the Catholics and Pitt. After much consideration Pitt and Cornwallis promised Catholics full political equality in return for their support of the union. Understandably they kept these negotiations a secret from Clare, but shortly after the union the truth came out. The measure failed, thanks mainly to zealous resistance on the part of the king and Clare. Clare had the satisfaction of seeing the treacherous Pitt resign, but a sense of betrayal haunted him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>For their part, even allies avoided him after the union. Henry Addington, Pitt's anti-emancipation successor, excluded Clare from his cabinet. Although Addington opposed further political concessions to Catholics he did not want to insult them by giving office to a violent opponent. Even George III, a warm admirer of Clare, warned Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke, the first post-union lord lieutenant, about the Irish lord chancellor. While praising Clare as a trustworthy man the king added, &#145;if not attended to [he] may attempt to guide, which can neither be expedient nor creditable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.530).<h2>
<a name="Finalmonths"></a>Final months</h2>Clare never learned of the king's warnings or Addington's reason for keeping him out of the new union government, but he sensed a decline in his influence and wanted desperately to reassert it. If he had acted with his usual skill he probably would have succeeded. Despite the warnings about Clare, Hardwicke welcomed his guidance. Unfortunately Clare came to despise Hardwicke as a fool. As for the new chief secretary, Charles Abbott, Clare dismissed him as &#145;the most arrogant, presumptuous, empty prig I have ever met with or heard of&#146;  (Keele University, Sneyd muniments, Clare to Auckland, 19 Sept 1801). Clare's sudden death on 28 January 1802, at his home, 6 Ely Place, Dublin, spared him further conflict. Two weeks before he had complained of a nosebleed lasting several days. He also suffered from oedema. Although no definite diagnosis is possible his symptoms suggest cirrhosis. He was a heavy drinker, a fact that both friends and enemies acknowledged. He was buried at St Peter's churchyard, Dublin, on 30 January. His funeral was a carnival of loathing. An angry mob waited outside his house and cheered when the coffin was carried out of the door. As the hearse travelled to the church onlookers threw debris on the coffin. In 1983 Clare's corpse suffered a final indignity when St Peter's was demolished. The bodies in the churchyard, including Clare's, were moved to a mass grave at Mount Jerome.<h2>
<a name="Family"></a>Family</h2>Throughout his life Clare maintained an impressive public image. His good looks certainly aided him. According to one otherwise antagonistic journalist FitzGibbon was a &#145;handsome youth&#146;, with &#145;beautiful&#146; grey eyes  (<span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span>, 27 Jan 1781). Even when age and alcoholism took their toll he remained striking. His wealth also enhanced his image. He was noted for his lavish hospitality at his townhouse in Dublin and his estate at Mount Shannon, near Lisnagry, co. Limerick. Lady Clare's beauty complemented him perfectly.<br>
<br>Clare's letters reveal him as a devoted father and an indulgent husband. His children continued to revere his memory. John, second earl of Clare (1792&#150;1851), an object of Byron's adolescent passion, even fought a duel with Henry Grattan's son, in response to an alleged defamation of his father.<br>
<br>Clare's beloved family rejected much of his political legacy after his death. His wife took the lead. After his death the fashionable lady became a pragmatic politician, throwing her support behind pro-Catholic candidates in Limerick elections. Unlike her husband Lady Clare recognized that she needed the Catholic vote to maintain the political interests of her sons. While remaining loyal to their father's memory by supporting the union both John and Richard Hobart, third earl of Clare (1793&#150;1864) were, like their mother, supporters of Catholic claims. Clare's daughter, Isabella (1795&#150;1873), remained at home as her mother's companion, and never married.<br>
<br>Richard's daughter, Lady Louisa FitzGibbon, went even further than her father, uncle, and grandmother, converting to Roman Catholicism and adding a chapel to Mount Shannon. Her overspending drove the family into bankruptcy. After arranging for her own retirement to a convent Louisa gave a final ball at Mount Shannon. Hundreds of people attended the final auction of FitzGibbon property in 1888. According to one account a Limerick merchant paid &pound;98 for a single teacup. An Irish-American businessman purchased the house, but hatred for the most notorious owner persisted. During the 1918&#150;21 war of independence, the IRA burned Mount Shannon, and at the end of the twentieth century it was a vine-covered ruin in the middle of a suburban housing estate.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Clare's memory continued to suffer insult in the pages of anti-union or United Irish memoirs that poured from the presses during the nineteenth century. In his memoirs Henry Grattan condemned Clare as a cynical opportunist and bigot. W. E. H. Lecky, a scrupulously fair historian, came to the same conclusion. He never could forgive Clare for opposing Grattan and supporting the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>.<br>
<br>Clare was as ardently loved, especially among arch-protestants and imperialists. Sir Richard Musgrave made him one of the heroes of his anti-Catholic <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Different Rebellions in Ireland</span> (1802). J. A. Froude, author of <span class="italic">The History of the English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1881), eulogized Clare as the unrelenting enemy of everything that threatened the British empire in Ireland, especially disaffected Catholics and foolish humanitarians. He even had Catholic defenders, notably James Roche, a lifelong acquaintance of the FitzGibbon family. According to Roche, Clare was a &#145;generous and indulgent landlord, a kind master and an attached friend&#146;. Roche also contradicted claims of Clare's cruelty in 1798, maintaining that he had saved many people &#145;whose legal guilt could not be gainsaid&#146; from &#145;the lash and the halter&#146;  (Roche, 2.113&#150;14).<br>
<br>A modern biographer inevitably faces frustration when sorting through this welter of hagiography and demonology. Clare is difficult to understand because he himself was never sure of his place in eighteenth-century Irish society. Throughout his life he strove to escape his Catholic origins and embrace a new, protestant identity, yet could never entirely reject his Catholic past. He hated Irish Catholics, yet he also pitied their past sufferings and current poverty. He never fully belonged to the Irish protestant &eacute;lite, and worse, the English, whom he idolized, never fully accepted him either. The cause of an Ireland ruled by a class of Church of Ireland landowners dependent on the link with Great Britain, where Catholics were excluded from any role in political life, was effectively dead within thirty years of his death. His best qualities, perhaps, were revealed in his statements as a judge; his ruling in <i>Kiely v. Monck</i>, for example, could still be cited in the European Court of Human Rights two centuries later.<br>
