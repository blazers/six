<span class="headword">Birnie,  Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Cock of the Steeple]</span>  (1826&#150;1862), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Moray; nothing is known about his parents. At an early age he went to England, and became a Baptist minister in Preston. During a period of major labour strikes in the town he wrote several letters to local journals, commenting on events. At some point he married and had several children.<br>
<br>In 1860 Birnie walked to Falkirk, arriving in the town penniless. He eventually found employment as a painter at the town's Carron works. During this period he began to write journalistic notes, signing himself Cock of the Steeple. Following dismissal from the Carron works for intemperance, he eventually became a member of the regular staff of the <span class="italic">Falkirk Advertiser</span>. In 1861 he started the <span class="italic">Falkirk Liberal</span> as an organ of the feuars of Falkirk. It was published at &frac12;<i>d</i>. per copy, and printed in Stirling. It rapidly collapsed.<br>
<br>Devastated by the blow, Birnie made his way to Edinburgh, apparently in the hope of finding work. On being robbed of the little money he had, he resolved to commit suicide, and made an unsuccessful attempt to poison himself with laudanum. He then set off on foot for Newcastle, all the while making daily entries in a journal. In March 1862 he was found in Morpeth, where he had lain in a stack of straw for two weeks without food or drink. He died on 25 March soon after being moved to the local workhouse hospital. In his final diary entry he requested that a selection of his articles might be published and sold on behalf of his family, but this was never carried out, although a subscription was raised for their assistance.<br>
