<span class="headword">Bird,  Theophilus</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born into a theatrical family, if indeed he was the child baptized at St Leonard, Shoreditch, on 7 December 1608, the son of William Bird or Borne (<i>d</i>. 1624), an actor with Prince Henry's Men, later Palsgrave's Men, at the Fortune playhouse, in the immediate vicinity of which the elder Bird was living by 1622. The first record of Theophilus Bird's acting comes in 1625, when he played Paulina in Massinger's <span class="italic">The Renegado</span>, performed by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit playhouse in Drury Lane. He remained a member of that company until 1636&#150;7, and continued to play female roles into his twenties, including Toota in Heywood's <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the West</span>; by 1635 he had begun to take male roles: in that year he played Massanissa in Nabbes's <span class="italic">Hannibal and Scipio</span>. During the prolonged plague of 1636&#150;7 the manager of the Cockpit, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66593/', "Christopher Beeston")</script>, installed a new resident troupe, the King and Queen's Young Company (or Beeston's Boys), which Bird joined. About the same time he allied himself to the theatrical clan of the Beestons by marrying Christopher's daughter Anne, with whom he was to have seven children. The two eldest died young and were buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields, in which parish Bird seems to have lived for all his adult life in London; he was in turn buried at the church.<br>
<br>Bird changed companies again in or after 1638, no doubt following his father-in-law's death in October of that year, becoming a member of the King's Men, with which group he retained associations until the foundation of the new King's Company in 1660. His position in the pre-war company later became a matter of some dispute with his fellows; in 1655 he sued them for not having received his share of money and goods when they disbanded, after the prohibition of playing in September 1642. Their reply was that he had not fully paid the &pound;200 agreed upon when he first joined them. Notwithstanding this disagreement he was a sharer in the company organized in January 1648, with John Lowin, Richard Robinson, Robert Benfield, Thomas Pollard, Hugh Clarke, and Stephen Hammerton. It appears that the actors intended to reopen the Blackfriars playhouse, although there is no evidence that they succeeded. They probably performed <i>ad hoc</i> in other places, but by July the company had reconstituted itself, and Bird apparently left it, perhaps because of the money quarrel he subsequently took to law. He then became involved in theatrical investment with his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67810/', "William Beeston")</script>: in 1652 he bought a share of the lease of the Salisbury Court playhouse, where a number of surreptitious performances were given in the interregnum period, and he may have acted in Killigrew's <span class="italic">Claricilla</span>, performed in March 1653 and interrupted by a raid by government soldiers.<br>
<br>By 1659&#150;60 public playing was resumed at three surviving playhouses: Salisbury Court, the Cockpit in Drury Lane, and the Red Bull. Bird perhaps performed at the theatre in which he held a stake, but by this date he was also related to a second leading actor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18885/', "Michael Mohun")</script>, who had married his daughter Anne. The two men had known each other since the 1630s, when Mohun had been a member of Beeston's Boys at the Cockpit. In 1660 Mohun led the troupe at the Red Bull, and Bird may have performed with him there; he may also have followed Mohun in joining the King's Company in mid-1660, though Bird's presence was not officially registered until late in 1661.<br>
<br>Bird's career with the King's Company accordingly lasted only two or three seasons, during which time he may have played the Duke of Missena in Flecknoe's <span class="italic">Erminia</span> and Woolfort in Fletcher's <span class="italic">Beggars' Bush</span>; he played Lord Audley in Heywood's <span class="italic">The Royal King and the Loyal Subject</span>, possibly the Second Lord in Shirley's <span class="italic">The Cardinal</span>, and he was injured in a stage accident during a performance of Suckling's <span class="italic">Aglaura</span> in September 1662: Pepys noted that &#145;Bird hath lately broke his leg, while he was fencing&#146; in the play  (Pepys, 3.204). Bird held a full acting share in the company, but perhaps only during his active membership, since it is not mentioned in his will; yet he did leave jointly to his sons Theophilus (also an actor) and George &#145;all my right and title in all the playes and play books that are mine&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 9172/55). Bird also wrote occasional prologues: two survive in the 1639 edition of Ford's <span class="italic">The Lady's Trial</span> and the 1658 edition of <span class="italic">The Witch of Edmonton</span>. He signed the dedications to the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, and to Ford and Dekker's <span class="italic">The Sun's Darling</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Bird died in London. He made his will on 20 March 1663, and was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields on 31 March. In the lengthy religious preamble to the will he beseeched God &#145;to receive mee into the number of his Elect and chosen company and according to the Full trust and beleife which I have reposed onely in his Ineffable mercy through the Shedding of his most precious Blood, and through the same Faith I have full hope I shall live againe and See my Lord and Redeemer&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 9172/55). He named his wife, Anne, as his executor and chief beneficiary; to each of his surviving children, Anne Mohun, Mary, Theophilus, George, and Elizabeth, he left 20 shillings, and a similar amount to the poor, in addition to the professional bequest to his sons noted above. The will says little of his entire worth, but the Bird family is likely to have been comfortably off; Anne Bird had inherited &pound;300 from her father at his death in 1638.<br>
