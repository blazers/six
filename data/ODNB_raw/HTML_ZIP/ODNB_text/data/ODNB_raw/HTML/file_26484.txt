<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, earl of Mar and Garioch  (1457?&#150;1479/80), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the fourth, and third surviving, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14588/', "James II (1430&#150;1460)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18249/', "Mary of Gueldres (d. 1463)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III, king of Scots")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26453/', "Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany")</script>, were his elder brothers. Born probably by July 1457, he was given the title earl of Mar and Garioch (the latter was hitherto a separate lordship) between 21 June 1458 and 23 June 1459. He started life in the royal nursery at Stirling Castle and was moved to Falkland in 1463 and subsequently to Doune Castle in 1468; he remained there for three years, during which time his academic tutor was Master Symon Dodds. In 1471 he emerged from pupillage and took control of the affairs&#151;or at least the rents&#151;of his northern earldom.<br>
<br>Apart from his tutor's conventional praise of him as a noble and illustrious lord and Pitscottie's later statement that the earl &#145;knew nothing but nobility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historie and Cronicles</span>, 163), we know little of Mar's character or life. In the 1470s he appears to have lived mostly in the north, having a town house in Aberdeen and, it would seem, participating in Aberdonian feuds. James III wrote to the burgh of Aberdeen in 1476 saying that he had given Mar &#145;special charge and command to supply and defend &hellip; [the burgh] in our absence&#146;  (Stuart, 35).<br>
<br>In March 1479 Mar attended the Edinburgh parliament which was swiftly followed by James III's attack on the castle of their brother, Albany, at Dunbar. Mar was alive and at liberty, though not in parliament, on 13 October 1479, but apparently under arrest, possibly dead, by 27 January 1480; he is described as dead and forfeited&#151;suggesting strongly that he had been executed&#151;by 14 July 1480. His crime is unknown. Later chroniclers' statements that he had conspired with witches against the king's life and was bled to death or drowned in a brewer's vat do not carry conviction. If he was first imprisoned at Craigmillar Castle, as Giovanni Ferrerio, writing in the following century, alleged, then James III's familiar Thomas Preston may have had a hand in his removal. King James himself, making a grant to St Salvator's College, St Andrews, in July 1480, required that masses should be said for the soul of the earl of Mar.<br>
