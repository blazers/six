<span class="headword">Salmon,  Frederick</span>  (1796&#150;1868), <span class="occ">rectal surgeon and founder of St Mark's Hospital, London</span>, was born on 11 April 1796 in Bath, the son of Henry Salmon (1754/5&#150;1827), attorney, and his wife, Denne (1762/3&#150;1853). Salmon was the sixth of nine children, of whom three boys and four girls survived into adulthood. His brothers Edward and Henry were apprenticed in law, whereas Frederick was apprenticed on 27 November 1811 to Joseph Hume Spry (<i>c</i>.1778&#150;1859), a member of a family of apothecary-surgeons in Bath. Salmon attended the Casualty Hospital in Bath for two years, possibly as a pupil to James Norman, to whose surgeon son, George, Salmon dedicated a book. Salmon was also associated with William White (1762&#150;1826), surgeon to the City Infirmary and Dispensary and one of the few rectal disease specialists of the time.<br>
<br>Salmon became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries on 27 March 1817 and followed Spry to London to gain experience so that he could practise there. From October 1817 for six months he walked the wards at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, as a pupil of John Abernethy. In 1818 Salmon was granted membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1820 he became Abernethy's house surgeon.<br>
<br>Between 1820 and 1827 Salmon attempted four times to gain an appointment at the General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street, in the City of London. In 1820 he declared that he would not, as usually happened, pay to create governors who would then vote him onto the staff. However, in 1824 he did pay out at least 200 guineas, but failed to match a competitor.<br>
<br>In 1827, on Abernethy's retirement, Salmon sought to succeed him at St Bartholomew's but discovered that Abernethy was supporting another applicant, Frederick Skey, who had promised to pass the position later to Abernethy's young son. The newly established reformist medical journal <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> took up the case, but to no avail. In 1827 Salmon finally secured an appointment to the General Dispensary after vote-buying had been banned there.<br>
<br>Salmon lived and practised in the City of London, from 1818 at 30 Bucklersbury, off Cheapside, and from 1828 at 12 Old Broad Street. He married Clara Breese (1805/6&#150;1877), possibly the daughter of a clock manufacturer of 5 North Place, Gray's Inn Road, London, about 1828. They had three sons. The eldest, Frederick Breese Salmon (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1853), joined the 9th Bombay native infantry and died aged twenty-one on 17 January 1853 at Belgaum, in east India. The second son, Percy Howell Salmon, was born in Dulwich and died in Ostend on 1 June 1893. The third son, William Mayer Salmon (<i>c</i>.1837&#150;1880), became a civil servant and magistrate in Bombay.<br>
<br>By the late 1820s Salmon was specializing in the treatment of rectal diseases. He published <span class="italic">A Practical Essay on Stricture of the Rectum</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">Practical Observations on Prolapsus of the Rectum</span> (1831). He also published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. Salmon argued that stricture of the rectum was the cause of many rectal complaints. However, James O'Beirne (1786&#150;1862), a Dublin surgeon, challenged him, arguing that what Salmon described as stricture was in fact part of the normal rectum. Later surgeons concurred with O'Beirne's interpretation.<br>
<br>Salmon associated himself with medical reformers. In 1833 he gave an oration to the Medical Society of London in which he lambasted the Royal College of Surgeons for promoting the lucrative interests of the few rather than supporting surgery generally or fighting quackery. Also in 1833 Salmon lost his position at the dispensary, when the staff resigned over perceived lay interference. If Salmon were to secure a hospital position again, essential for its contacts with well-off governors who might become patients, one possibility was to establish his own institution. By the 1830s a number of special hospitals were being established, despite opposition from leaders in the medical profession.<br>
<br>Salmon was a member of the City of London Club, whose chairman, John Masterman, a banker and later an MP, supported Salmon as he now established his own hospital. At least eight of the club's committee members and about twenty-five other members were among the founding benefactors when, in 1835, Salmon set up in Aldersgate Street the Benevolent Dispensary for the Relief of the Poor afflicted with Fistula, Piles and Other Diseases of the Rectum. Club member William Taylor Copeland, of the porcelain makers Copeland Spode, and lord mayor of London (1835&#150;6), was its first president. Within its first year the dispensary became an infirmary with seven beds. Salmon was the only full (that is consultant) surgeon; he was assisted by a resident house surgeon and a matron.<br>
<br>In 1837 the infirmary moved to a 14 bed house in Charterhouse Square, off Smithfield. In 1853 it moved again, to a new building in the City Road near the Angel, Islington. The governors wished to name the hospital something suitable and unembarrassing, while Salmon wished to emphasize its speciality. It became St Mark's Hospital for Fistula and Other Diseases of the Rectum, and was officially opened by the lord mayor on St Mark's day, 25 April 1854. Salmon used his hospital position to good effect: he developed influential treatments, and his private practice flourished. Among his notable patients was Charles Dickens, treated in 1841 for fistula. By 1849 Salmon and his family had moved to 18 Lower Berkeley Street; afterwards he moved again, to Manchester Square, though he also continued to practise in Old Broad Street.<br>
<br>In 1857 Salmon retired from practice and from active surgical involvement at St Mark's. He moved to Woodfield Cedars, Ombersley, near Droitwich, Worcestershire, though retaining his house in Manchester Square. He retired as honorary surgeon in 1859, and to mark this the governors commissioned a portrait by Francis Grant RA, to hang in the hospital.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1868 Salmon died of acute bronchitis at Woodfield Cedars; he was buried on 10 January in Kensal Green cemetery, in west London. His widow, Clara, died of cancer in Brighton, Sussex, aged seventy-one, on 23 November 1877. Following his death the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> suggested that &#145;the course he took was prompted by difficulties in pursuing an useful and honourable career in a general hospital&#146;, and that his establishment of his hospital was &#145;contrary to the interests of the profession and the public&#146;, and had &#145;encouraged similar enterprises&#146;. Nevertheless, it noted that he had &#145;influence in certain wealthy circles&#146; and a &#145;lucrative practice&#146;, despite professional isolation  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1.41&#150;2).<br>
<br>However, it was specialization such as Salmon's which gathered in pace in the nineteenth century and took off in the twentieth. Staff at St Mark's increasingly came to play a key role at the top of the profession and in developing the fields of rectal, later colorectal, surgery, and also of gastroenterology. Salmon could thus be judged a successful medical entrepreneur at a time when entrepreneurial activity of all kinds was in the ascendant.<br>
