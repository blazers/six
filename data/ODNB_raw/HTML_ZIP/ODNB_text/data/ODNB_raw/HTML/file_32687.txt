<span class="headword">Custance, Sir  Reginald Neville</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Barfleur]</span>  (1847&#150;1935), <span class="occ">naval officer and author</span>, was born in Belfast on 20 September 1847, the eldest son of General William Neville Custance and his second wife, Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas Meggison of Walton, Northumberland. He entered the navy in September 1860 aboard the training ship <i>Britannia</i>. He then served in the frigate <i>Euryalus</i> and was present at the bombardment of the Japanese clan forts at Kagoshima in 1863, and Shimonoseki in 1864. He was promoted lieutenant on 6 February 1868, a year in which he received the Royal Humane Society silver medal for life-saving. He served in the West Indies between 1868 and 1872, before joining the instructing staff of the gunnery training ship HMS <i>Excellent</i> in 1873. He remained aboard the <i>Excellent</i>, as a senior staff lieutenant, from 1875 to 1878. He was promoted commander on 31 March 1878, and spent the following year at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Between November 1880 and early 1884 he commanded the sloop <i>Flamingo</i> in the West Indies. His promotion to the substantive rank of captain followed on 31 December 1885.<br>
<br>In October 1886 Custance was ordered to the Admiralty, to prepare a scheme for mobilization. He was subsequently appointed assistant director of naval intelligence on the formation of the naval intelligence department, and served under Captain W. H. Hall until 1889 and then under Captain Sir Cyprian Bridge. Bridge, along with Admiral Philip Colomb, became a major influence on his intellectual development. While at the Admiralty, Custance had a good working relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33143/', "Captain John Fisher")</script>, the director of naval ordnance; both supported the battleship against the French torpedo boat challenge. In January 1890 he took command of the cruiser <i>Phaeton</i> in the Mediterranean. Between September 1893 and January 1895 he served as naval attach&eacute; at Washington and Paris. In February 1895 he took command of the new second-class battleship <i>Barfleur</i>, serving in the Mediterranean and from early 1898 the China station. He later took her name as his pen-name, a reflection of his preference for small battleships, based on the views of Bridge and Sir John Laughton.<br>
<br>Between March 1899 and November 1902 Custance, who had been promoted rear-admiral on 1 August 1899, was director of naval intelligence. The appointment reflected the high opinion of his abilities held at the Admiralty. A well-informed student of strategy, Custance used his position to promote the study of history as the basis for the development of modern doctrine. He also established the defence and trade divisions of the department. He forced the intelligence department into the heart of Admiralty policy-making, by a combination of will-power and intellect. At this stage he was considered among the most brilliant officers in the service; yet his subsequent career was ruined by a clash of wills that warped his judgement. His relationship with Fisher deteriorated when Fisher went to the Mediterranean, largely as a result of Fisher's constant criticism of Admiralty policy, both in official correspondence and carefully handled newspaper leaks. The two men became bitter enemies after the Admiralty visit to Malta in 1901. Fisher had argued that more destroyers should be attached to his fleet, and persuaded the board to ignore Custance's advice that these were unnecessary. Custance knew that Fisher was exaggerating the threat to serve his own ambitions, and used the German navy as a counter-argument for keeping forces at home. This was considered premature, but it rapidly became policy when Fisher returned to the Admiralty in late 1904.<br>
<br>Between November 1902 and November 1904 Custance served as second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet. In early 1903 the Admiralty set up two committees to investigate the possibilities of long-range firing. Custance presided over the Mediterranean committee, and firings were carried out by his flagship, the <i>Venerable</i>. In view of the limited possibilities for combining range and observation with control of the guns, he initially deprecated long-range fire. After the first series of firings additional equipment was installed aboard the ship, and the results improved significantly. Custance's methodical work, reflecting six years at <i>Excellent</i>, laid the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated equipment and control systems that permitted accurate fire at hitherto unimagined distances. His report was highly commended by the Admiralty. Custance's interest in fire control led him to clash with Fisher over the merits of Arthur Pollen's promising designs.<br>
<br>In 1904 Custance was made KCMG and on 20 October that year he was promoted vice-admiral. He spent the next two years ashore, publishing under his pen-name, Barfleur, historically based criticisms of contemporary naval policy, collected in the volume <span class="italic">Naval Policy: a Plea for the Study of War</span> (1907). In February 1907 Fisher appointed him second in command of the Channel Fleet, under Lord Charles Beresford, because the two men disliked one another. Fisher's divide-and-rule tactics backfired. Discovering that a shared hatred overrode other misunderstandings, they formed the core of the &#145;syndicate of discontent&#146; ably supported by Rear-Admiral Doveton Sturdee, Beresford's chief of staff, and a galaxy of retired admirals. While Beresford was the figure-head, Custance provided the brains. His personal animus drove the syndicate, and reduced the last three years of Fisher's term at the Admiralty to one long rearguard action. Whatever the merits of either case, the real beneficiary was the army, which exploited Beresford to assume the leading position in national strategy. In this Custance revealed the worst side of his character, allowing personal antipathies to colour his judgement, to the detriment of the service and the state.<br>
<br>Promoted full admiral in May 1908, Custance hauled down his flag for the last time in July, an occasion marked by the customary KCB. He lingered on the active list until 1912, and was created GCB the following year, and an honorary DCL from the University of Oxford. He continued to be consulted, notably by Churchill, but the bitter hostility of Fisher ensured that he had no influence. His chances for fleet command, or service at the Admiralty, for which he was well suited, were destroyed by his role in the &#145;syndicate&#146;. He was too clearly identified with the quarrel to be employed by those seeking to heal the breach.<br>
<br>The remainder of Custance's life was devoted to the study of war, and the promotion of his thesis that the naval mind had become divided into two schools, the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> and the historical, and that the dominance of the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> school resulted in warships designed on entirely incorrect principles. The generalization was erroneous and simplistic, as his own career demonstrated. The pamphlets <span class="italic">The Fighting Power of the Capital Ship</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">The Military Growth of the Capital Ship</span> (1910) were stimulating and intelligent critiques of Fisher's policy; in them Custance argued that speed had been important throughout the nineteenth century because the enemy would be running away, and that this was no longer the case because the relative naval balance had shifted away from the Royal Navy. Consequently, as both sides wanted to fight, firepower would decide the contest.<br>
<br>During the First World War Custance publicly criticized the influence of Sir Julian Corbett on the doctrine of the navy. He considered that Corbett had deprecated the importance of seeking decisive battle. Subsequently he contributed to the <span class="italic">Naval Review</span>, the closed-circulation professional journal, and published three more books: <span class="italic">The Ship of the Line in Battle</span> (1912), <span class="italic">War at Sea: Modern Theory and Ancient Practice</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">A Study of War</span> (1924). The last two were peculiarly wrong-headed, arguing that sound strategy required a concentration on the military aim of destroying enemy armed forces before attempting to secure political aims. As Donald Schurman observed, Custance's work adds &#145;to our knowledge of naval controversy, but not to the growth of naval history&#146;  (Schurman, <span class="italic">Education</span>, 14). Custance died at his home, Beaumont Broad, Broadclyst, Devon, on 30 August 1935.<br>
<br>Custance was part of a small but professionally significant group of officers who made a serious study of war in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. This group, linked to Professor Sir John Knox Laughton, included Cyprian Bridge, Philip Colomb, Doveton Sturdee, Gerard Noel, and Prince Louis of Battenberg. All were members of the council of the Navy Records Society, which used history as the basis from which to develop a modern naval doctrine. However, Custance saw history as a source of support for his case, not an all-embracing approach to the comprehension of major issues. Although possessed of a powerful mind and great knowledge of the service, he had little influence on policy. His narrow, dogmatic, and inflexible opinions were delivered with an uncommon degree of venom, especially when dealing with Fisher. He lacked the mental flexibility to benefit from debate.<br>
<br>Custance set high standards for his subordinates, both as officers and gentlemen. He kept a generous table as an admiral, and was interested in the views of junior officers. However, he lacked the personal warmth to inspire unthinking devotion, while his suspicious nature made him a difficult superior. A confirmed bachelor, his arrogant and unbending approach deprived his work of lasting value, and his life of close society. The one friend of his last years was Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, another cold intellectual naval outsider. It was through Richmond, and personal correspondence, that Custance's notion of a service divided between the historical and the <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> schools came to influence the work of the American historian Arthur J. Marder. Marder considered that Custance combined &#145;a nasty temperament devoid of generosity&#146; with &#145;the cleverness of a monkey&#146;  (Marder, <span class="italic">From the Dreadnought</span>, 1.91). Custance's quarrel with Fisher warped his judgement, and deprived the navy of the services of a highly competent and learned officer. The sad irony was that the two men agreed on so many of the key issues concerned with the modernization of the Royal Navy.<br>
