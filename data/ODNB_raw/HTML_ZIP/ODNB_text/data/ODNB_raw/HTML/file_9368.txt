<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferriar,  John</span>  (1761&#150;1815), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of the Revd Alexander Ferriar (<i>d</i>. 1764), Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Mary Burn, was born at Oxnam, near Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, on 21 November 1761. After his father's death in 1764 the family moved to his mother's native Alnwick, where she married her second husband, Thomas Ilderton. Ferriar studied medicine at Edinburgh University and took his MD degree in 1781, with a thesis entitled <span class="italic">De variola</span>. He married Barbara Gair (<i>d</i>. 1800), at Alnwick on 16 October 1782.<br>
<br>After his marriage Ferriar began to practise medicine at Stockton-on-Tees, but in 1785 he moved to Manchester. Soon after his arrival he joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society for which he wrote a number of papers covering poetry, drama, and archaeology; these included a paper on the work of Laurence Sterne, and a paper on materialism which was dedicated to Thomas Cooper. This interest brought him into close association with the physician Thomas Percival and other local cultural leaders. In 1788&#150;90 Ferriar sided with the expansionist party in the politically divisive dispute over the role and staffing of the Manchester Infirmary. He was appointed in 1789 to a new post of assistant physician, with the duty of attending to the infirmary's existing home-patient service. In 1790 the reforming party succeeded, the medical staff was increased, and Ferriar became an honorary physician.<br>
<br>Ferriar's experience with infirmary home-patients led him to draw public notice to the wretched condition of the working classes. His paper on the epidemic fever of 1789&#150;90 pointed out the evils of filthy lodging houses, cellar dwellings, and unventilated cotton mills, and of inadequate food and clothing. He publicly urged the police committee to take a variety of sanitary measures, including the licensing of lodging houses, the establishment of fever wards, and the setting up of a committee of health. During the fever outbreak of 1795 Ferriar's latter suggestion was taken up by a group of influential laymen and doctors who established the innovative Manchester board of health in early 1796. This led to the foundation of the House of Recovery, or fever hospital, in the same year, which was the first such institution to be founded in Britain. Ferriar was also involved in the establishment of fever wards at nearby Stockport.<br>
<br>Ferriar became the premier physician in Manchester and gained an extensive reputation. His medical writings were contained in <span class="italic">Medical Histories and Reflections</span> (vol. 1, 1792; vol. 2, 1795; vol. 3, 1798; 2nd edn, with additions, 4 vols., 1810&#150;13; American reprint, 1816). These included his writings on fever, and on cases and observations from his hospital practice; there was a paper in the second volume on insanity, and a paper in the second edition on the medical properties of foxglove (first published separately in 1799).<br>
<br>Ferriar's ideas about fever and about the treatment of insanity were important. He believed that the poison of fever was generated by the effluvia of the hungry and depressed poor living in overcrowded, dirty, and ill-ventilated conditions; that the remedy was to provide more space and air circulation; that the wealthy had a moral duty to help the fevered poor through charity&#151;otherwise contagion would spread, ultimately to the rich as well as to the poor; and that neither the miseries of poverty nor the dangers of luxury were healthy in society. Ferriar's ideas on insanity derived from his experience as a physician to the infirmary's lunatic hospital. He advocated the management of the mind by a system of mild but exact discipline, using encouragements and rewards or else punishment through seclusion, solitude, and deprivation of light and food. His purpose in disciplining was to instil self-restraint, and he believed that mechanical means should be avoided if possible but that a sense of imposed restraint was important and thus that removal from home quickened recovery. He also stated that separate hospital accommodation for convalescents could be a powerful reward.<br>
<br>During his career Ferriar was involved in various local professional disputes. He aided the surgeon William Simmons in an acrimonious medical controversy with Dr John Hull in 1798&#150;9 over the caesarean operation, which they opposed. He also sided with Simmons in a long series of disputes among the infirmary staff, but later he and Simmons quarrelled and became estranged.<br>
<br>Ferriar had considerable fame as a polite scholar. His best-known work is his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Sterne, with other Essays and Verses</span> (1798; 2nd edn, 2 vols., with additions, 1812), in which Sterne's obligations to the old French novelists are skilfully traced. The second edition contains an entertaining poem entitled &#145;The Bibliomania, an Epistle to Richard Heber, Esq.&#146; (originally published in a shorter version in 1809). His last work was <span class="italic">An Essay towards a Theory of Apparitions</span> (1813), on mental hallucinations.<br>
<br>Ferriar was living in St James's Square, Manchester, in 1788, but moved to 4 Dawson Street before 1794, and to 27 Mosley Street after 1811. Between 1805 and 1810 he was taxed on his Dawson Street house, which had twenty-three windows and a yearly rental value of &pound;80, and on his two male servants, one four-wheeled carriage, and three riding horses. Ferriar died at Manchester on 4 February 1815, his wife having predeceased him in 1800; he was buried in St Mary's Church, Manchester, on 9 February. In his will he left his Mosley Street house, on a ninety-nine year lease, with coach house and stables, to his eldest son, along with his library of books, maps, and prints, and life policies for &pound;1500 and &pound;3500. Of his five surviving children, two sons, Thomas Ilderton (<i>d</i>. 1821) and John (<i>d</i>. 1829), became soldiers, serving as members of the British Legion at Venezuela; the other sons, Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1836) and Arthur Edward William (<i>d</i>. 1835), became lawyers, the former holding judicial office in India. The daughter, Jane Catherine, died unmarried at Leek, Staffordshire, in 1864.<br>
