<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jacob <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Kennedy-Erskine]</span>,  Violet Augusta Mary Frederica</span>  (1863&#150;1946), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 1 September 1863 at the House of Dun, near Montrose in Angus (Forfarshire), on the east coast of Scotland. She was the eldest of the three surviving children of William Henry Kennedy-Erskine (1828&#150;1870), laird of Dun, and Catherine (1839&#150;1914), daughter of William Jones, landowner, of Henllys, Carmarthenshire, Wales. A brother, John (<i>b</i>. 1864), died in infancy, and her younger sister, Millicent Augusta Lilian, born in 1867, died in 1883 at the age of sixteen. Her brother, Augustus John William Henry Kennedy-Erskine (1866&#150;1908), who had succeeded as laird, died and was buried at sea, aged forty-two.<br>
<br>Violet Kennedy-Erskine grew up at Dun, and was educated at home, showing early literary and artistic interests. Her first book, which she also illustrated, was published by Blackwood in 1888, and was a comic narrative poem in Scots, written collaboratively with William Douglas Campbell. This minor work is of much less interest than her later poetry, also mainly in Scots, although it is perhaps her fiction which most strongly justifies Jacob's place in the canon of Scottish literature. Much of her writing draws imaginatively on her early experience of life in Angus, and on knowledge of her family's past. The Erskines of Dun were an ancient family, whose history she later recorded in <span class="italic">The Lairds of Dun</span> (1931). Lands at Dun purchased by Sir Robert Erskine of that ilk in 1375 belonged to the family until the twentieth century. Several of Jacob's ancestors were notable figures. John Erskine, fifth laird of Dun, a moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, was active in the emergence of the reformed church in Scotland and friendly with John Knox, although considered moderate by Mary, queen of Scots. The House of Dun, designed by William Adam, was built for David Erskine (<i>bap</i>. 1673, <i>d</i>. 1758), the thirteenth laird, an eminent Scottish judge who, as a covert Jacobite, espoused different religious and political affiliations from his predecessors. He is the likely model for the character David Logie in what is probably Violet's most significant achievement, her novel <span class="italic">Flemington</span> (1911); the house, which also appears fictionalized as Balnillo, was acquired by the National Trust for Scotland. Violet's grandmother Augusta was a daughter of the actress Dorothy Jordan and the duke of Clarence (later William IV). These and other aspects of her family history may partly account for her sympathy for the unconventional throughout her work.<br>
<br>On 27 October 1894, at St John's Episcopal Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh, Violet married Arthur Otway Jacob (1867&#150;1936), an Irishman born in Maryborough (now Portlaoise), educated in Dublin, and serving as a lieutenant with the 20th Royal Hussars, a cavalry regiment of the British army. It is not known how the couple met. Arthur Jacob rose to the rank of major, refusing further promotion because he suffered badly from asthma. Their son, Arthur Henry Jacob, known as Harry, was born on 25 August 1895 in Colchester, the site of the regimental barracks.<br>
<br>Arthur Jacob departed with his regiment in 1895 for India, to be stationed at Mhow, an army cantonment town on the plains of Indore state, Central India Agency. Violet and Harry followed soon after. Their years in India were happy ones, recorded by the writer in diaries and letters she sent to her mother, and <span class="italic">Diaries and Letters from India, 1895&#150;1900</span> was published posthumously in 1990. Violet Jacob responded warmly to local life, learning to speak some Hindustani, and taking a strong interest in Hindu culture. She met various rulers of the Central Indian States, including the maharajas Holkar of Indore and Sindhia of Gwalior. She also had friends and acquaintances among expatriates; one, Adela Nicolson (1865&#150;1904), went on later to publish poetry under the name Laurence Hope. Although Violet Jacob worked as a nurse in the local military hospital at Mhow (and nursed again during wartime), she enjoyed considerable freedom in India, riding on the plains, and collecting and painting plants. Shortly before her death she offered her five volumes of Indian flower paintings to the University of Edinburgh; these were later moved to the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Arthur Jacob's regiment was posted to South Africa from 1901 to 1902, participating in the last few months of the South African War. The Jacobs also went with the hussars to Egypt (1903&#150;4). Susan Tweedsmuir, later married to the writer John Buchan, accompanied her mother to Cairo as a girl, and met Violet Jacob, writing in her autobiography: &#145;Violet had published a small book of poetry, which made her a little suspect to the military society of Cairo. But her charm and beauty and aptitude for getting on with people helped her to live down even poetry&#146;  (Tweedsmuir, 54&#150;5). A painting of Violet Jacob as a young woman shows a large-eyed, pale-skinned beauty, and the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, too, was later to remember her as a charming and handsome woman looking younger than her years  (Garden, 10).<br>
<br>Violet Jacob published a volume of poetry in English, <span class="italic">Verses</span>, in 1905, but while in India had already embarked on her first novel, <span class="italic">The Sheepstealers</span> (1902). Set in the Welsh borderlands, and based around the Rebecca riots of the 1840s, this was well received on publication, and was compared with the work of Thomas Hardy (in, for instance, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 13 September 1902). Although the Jacobs lived in various English garrison towns they stayed at Llantomas, near Hay-on-Wye, Herefordshire, around 1908, and seem to have kept rooms there for many years, as Violet had relatives who probably offered the Llantomas house as a base, which the Jacobs used when they were on leave, and after Arthur Jacob's retirement. In 1908 Violet Jacob published two fictional works rooted in the Anglo-Welsh borderlands, a historical novel, <span class="italic">The History of Aythan Waring</span>, and a slight novella, <span class="italic">Irresolute Catherine</span>.<br>
<br>Violet Jacob also wrote fiction and poetry for children; an early volume was <span class="italic">The Golden Heart and other Fairy Stories</span> (1904), while <span class="italic">Tales Told by the Miller</span> (1909) are for older children. Her writing enabled her to augment the family income, and the quality of her work varies, but her adult Scottish fiction is very fine. <span class="italic">The Interloper</span> (1904) takes her beloved Angus as its location. Set in the early nineteenth century, the tale of young Gilbert Speid who returns from Spain to his inherited estate near Montrose echoes the work of Scott and Stevenson, and contains some excellent Scots dialogue, while Violet Jacob's style remains distinctively economical and ironic. This historical romance with tragicomic qualities was reprinted in 1912 and again in 1926. <span class="italic">Flemington</span> (1911) is an even more powerful novel, set mainly in Scotland after the Jacobite defeat at Culloden in 1746, exploring themes of loyalty and betrayal, and the nature of justice. It was described by John Buchan in a letter of 31 December 1911 as &#145;the best Scots romance since <span class="italic">The Master of Ballantrae</span>&#146;  (National Library of Scotland, MS 27416), and was well received by critics when it first appeared, and again when republished in 1994. The Angus locations are vividly evoked, and the many memorable characters include a sensitive young artist-protagonist, Archie Flemington, his strong and ambitious grandmother Christian, and Skirling Wattie, the legless beggar, whose singing voice suggests the lyrical qualities of Scottish folk culture. Although the narrative is gripping, and lightened by Jacob's wit, it is a sombre work.<br>
<br>Violet Jacob lost her mother in 1914, and the First World War brought further grief. Her son, Harry, died aged twenty, fighting with the Royal Fusiliers at the battle of the Somme in 1916. Around this time she moved around a good deal, writing letters from both Preston and Colchester during the war years. Although drawing strength from her Christian faith, according to Susan Tweedsmuir she never recovered entirely from her son's death. After this she wrote no more novels, but mainly produced poetry and shorter prose.<br>
<br>Many of Violet Jacob's poems were initially published in <span class="italic">Country Life</span>. Her first collection was <span class="italic">Songs of Angus</span> (1915), and this was very successful, appealing to exiled Scots, including soldiers, during wartime. The Aberdeenshire vernacular poet Charles Murray, who had emigrated to South Africa, wrote to Violet Jacob admiringly from there. The opening poem of this volume, &#145;Tam i'the Kirk&#146; has been much anthologized. <span class="italic">More Songs of Angus and Others</span> (1918) was followed by several more volumes, mainly in Scots. Her poetry was also published in <span class="italic">Northern Numbers</span> (1920&#150;22) by the young C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid), then working as a reporter in Montrose, who called her in the <span class="italic">Scottish Educational Journal</span> (17 July 1925) &#145;by far the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets&#146;. John Buchan included her in his anthology, <span class="italic">The Northern Muse</span> (1924). Violet Jacob's Scots poetry, which influenced among others Helen Cruickshank, draws on the ballad tradition and folk-song; it is skilfully crafted, notable for its handling of structure and metre. <span class="italic">The Scottish Poems of Violet Jacob</span> (1944) contains some of her best work, and was reprinted several times. Some of her poetry was set to music in the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>In 1920 the Jacobs moved for a time to Ludlow in Shropshire, but still grieving for her son, Violet Jacob found it difficult to settle. Nevertheless, she published a volume of tautly written short stories in 1922, <span class="italic">Tales of my Own Country</span>, set in Angus, which the Jacobs still visited regularly. In 1977 some further previously uncollected, and mainly unpublished, short stories from the 1920s and 1930s were discovered; the Second World War and paper shortages had blocked their publication. These appeared as <span class="italic">The Lum Hat and other Stories</span> in 1982, edited by Ronald Garden.<br>
<br>The Jacobs visited India for a second time in 1922&#150;3, accompanying Violet's relation Eilean Sandys-Thomas to her wedding in Bombay. They visited old haunts and explored new ones. Violet Jacob met the begum of Bhopal, then the only woman ruler of an Indian state, and a figure of some consequence, but Violet's diary of this visit remained unpublished at the end of the twentieth century. A young relative considered Violet Jacob herself &#145;quite a formidable, grand lady&#146;  (private information) when he met her in the early 1930s. The Jacobs were now spending their summers at Llantomas and winters abroad, because of Arthur's health. They appear to have spent several months in Liguria, Italy, in 1930, and in 1936 were in the south of France; some watercolours, sketches, and short essays reflect these travels.<br>
<br>Although Violet Jacob received an honorary degree (LLD) from Edinburgh University in 1936, she did not court fame. Only rare photographs of her remain, and she refused the use of her likeness in publicity for her work. She was a very private person, whose published letters and diaries suggest a spirited personality, yet are not very &#145;personal&#146;. The few extant unpublished letters to friends and acquaintances reveal intermittent glimpses of her inner life. Arthur Jacob's death late in 1936 was a terrible blow; although the couple had enjoyed independent interests it had been a long and happy marriage, and Violet wrote to a friend: &#145;I hardly know how to stand up to life now, but will try. I have lost what was more than life to me&#146;  (Montrose Library, correspondence of David Waterson, MS X/510/8). She moved back to Scotland, living at Marywell House near Kirriemuir in Angus until the end of her life. In these later years she apparently met the poet Marion Angus, but the meeting was not a success.<br>
<br>Violet Jacob died at Marywell House, near Kirriemuir, of heart disease on 9 September 1946 and was buried three days later. <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> obituary (11 September 1946) acknowledges her achievements, remarking that she &#145;was a woman of very strong character, with a delightful sense of humour&#146;. She was not buried in the Erskine burial-ground at the House of Dun, but shared her husband's grave under a modest headstone in the public graveyard at Dun kirk.<br>
