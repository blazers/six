<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [Philipps]</span>,  Morgan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1570), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Monmouthshire, and entered the University of Oxford in 1533. He soon made an impact as a bright, confident young man, and acquired the title Morgan the Sophister owing to his delight in debate. He graduated BA on 18 February 1538 and was elected a fellow of Oriel College on 17 April 1538. He received the degree of MA on 27 March 1542, and afterwards was ordained a priest, before proceeding to study for the degree of BTh. In 1543 he was presented to the rectory of Kiddington, Oxfordshire, and on 5 February 1545 he was appointed principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford. In 1549 he obtained the vicarage of St Winnoc, Pembrokeshire, while remaining as principal. In 1549 he took part in a public disputation with Peter Martyr Vermigli, the Italian friar and leading convert to protestantism, Phillips standing in for William Tresham, chaplain to Edmund Bonner.<br>
<br>In 1550 Phillips resigned as principal of St Mary Hall, having by then graduated BTh, and on 31 May 1554 he became precentor of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. Because of his commitments in west Wales and his absence from Oxford, his fellowship at Oriel College was declared vacant on 20 December 1554. However, the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558 forced Phillips to leave St David's Cathedral for Louvain. Soon afterwards he visited Rome with one of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, William Allen, who was at Louvain University. On his return to Flanders he co-operated with Allen in the foundation of the English College at Douai, pioneering the training of priests to win England and Wales back to Roman Catholicism. Indeed, Phillips was the main benefactor, as the Douai diaries admit: he gave the first sum of money for the purpose of establishing the college.<br>
<br>Another Oxford graduate who supported Phillips and Allen at Douai was Owen Lewis, son of an Anglesey squire, who had left his position as fellow of New College, Oxford, for Douai and became in 1561 regius professor of civil law at the University of Douai. The three were close friends, exiles for the sake of conscience, and zealous supporters of Mary, queen of Scots. The defeat of Mary's supporters at Carberry Hill and Langside (1567&#150;8) convinced the exiled Douai intellectuals that their immediate hope of the conversion of their home countries to Catholicism had to be abandoned. Phillips taught at the college, supporting Allen, until his death at Douai on 18 August 1570. By his will he left to William Allen all his Flanders property, which was used in the purchase of a house and garden for the enlargement of Douai College. Phillips had property in Oxfordshire and Pembrokeshire and on 15 February 1577 a commission was granted from the prerogative court of Canterbury to George Farmour of Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, to administer the goods, debts, and chattels of &#145;Morgan Phillips, clerk, sometimes chantor at the Cathedral Church of St David, who lately died in parts beyond the seas&#146;.<br>
<br>A book pleading Mary Stuart's right to the English throne was republished posthumously in 1571 at Douai, under Phillips's name as author and the title <span class="italic">Defence of the Honour of Mary Queen of Scotland</span>. But the book was in actual fact the work of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16492/', "John Lesley")</script>, Roman Catholic bishop of Ross.<br>
