<span class="headword">Bronhill,  June</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>June Mary Gough]</span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 26 June 1929 in Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, a mining town some 700 miles west of Sydney. Broken Hill had always had a strong connection with the arts, and as a daughter of this fiercely proud town June Gough was encouraged by friends and family to pursue her early aspirations as a singer. At the age of nineteen she travelled to Sydney, where, encouraged by her singing teacher, Marianne Mathy, whom she described as a &#145;second mother&#146;  (Carmody, 329), she entered and won the coveted Sun aria competition in 1950, a prize awarded the year before to Joan Sutherland.<br>
<br>Like many young Australians before and since, June Gough felt the need to visit Britain, where she hoped to realize her dream of becoming a professional singer. The cost was daunting, if not prohibitive, but outback communities had a habit of rallying around in times of need and it was decided by family and neighbours to raise the necessary funds to send her. She arrived in London in 1952. As a young singer competing in a market awash with graduates from leading conservatories in Britain and abroad she attempted to stand out from the crowd by changing her name. Her teacher suggested that she should adopt the name Chrystal Belle, but she dismissed this as too undignified and decided instead (and in tribute to those who had financed her journey) that her stage name should be Bronhill, a contraction of Broken Hill.<br>
<br>In London Bronhill studied with Dino Borgioli before making her European d&eacute;but as Ad&egrave;le in the Sadler's Wells production of Strauss's <span class="italic">Die Fledermaus</span> in 1954. That performance marked the beginning of a long relationship with the company, during which she explored much of the soprano literature. Her ability to hold the stage, her secure coloratura voice, and her capacity for hard work made her the natural choice for such roles as Norina in Donizetti's <span class="italic">Don Pasquale</span>, Gilda in Verdi's <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span>, the Queen of the Night in Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span>, and Zerbinetta in Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Ariadne auf Naxos</span>. As a member of a busy ensemble company she was also expected to perform works that were new to Sadler's Wells and was cast as Lucy in Menotti's <span class="italic">The Telephone</span>, and as Vixen Sharpears for the British premi&egrave;re of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek's <span class="italic">The Cunning Little Vixen</span> in 1961. But it was her work as an operetta singer that was most popular with audiences, and it was her performances in works like Strauss's <span class="italic">The Gypsy Baron</span>, Offenbach's <span class="italic">Orpheus and the Underworld</span> and <span class="italic">La vie parisienne</span>, and Lehar's <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> that defined her career. Of these <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> was the operetta with which she was most frequently associated. During her career she gave some 200 performances of the operetta, both in Britain and in Australia, and the Vilia aria soon became known in musical circles as &#145;June's tune&#146;. With William Reid, a British conductor who ended his career with the Australian Opera, she recorded the work for EMI, one of a series that the company made with Bronhill and the Sadler's Wells troupe performing works from the operetta canon.<br>
<br>Bronhill's success was not restricted to the Sadler's Wells Theatre; she also made an impact with other companies and in other genres and media. In 1959 the distinguished Australian soprano Joan Sutherland was indisposed during a regional tour of England with the Covent Garden company. She was scheduled to sing the title role in Donizetti's <span class="italic">Lucia di Lammermoor</span> at Oxford but was replaced at short notice by Bronhill. Although Sutherland was near the beginning of her long career, she had already made this role her own and subsequently recorded it with her husband, Richard Bonynge, and the renowned British conductor John Pritchard. For some the prospect of replacing such an illustrious colleague might have been daunting, but Bronhill rose to the challenge, performed with distinction, and won the admiration of the critics.<br>
<br>Having carved a niche for herself in British operatic life by the mid-1960s, Bronhill decided to explore the possibilities that the West End and television had to offer. In 1964 she was cast in Ron Grainer's <span class="italic">Robert and Elizabeth</span>, a musical version of the play <span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span>. Directed by Wendy Toye, the show was an outstanding success. It ran for 948 performances and was later taken to Australia. The fame that she achieved in live theatre and her easy manner with audiences meant that she was also an ideal choice for radio and television. In the 1960s and early 1970s she was a regular guest on BBC radio's light music programmes <span class="italic">Friday Night is Music Night</span>, <span class="italic">Variety Playhouse</span>, and <span class="italic">Palm Court</span>, and on Yorkshire Television's religious musical programme, <span class="italic">Stars on Sunday</span>.<br>
<br>For Australians living abroad the need to return to their homeland in maturity is often overwhelming. Bronhill eventually left Europe for Australia and made her home in Sydney from 1976, the year she was appointed OBE. At that time, however, she had no intention of retiring, and appeared successfully in a variety of opera, theatre, and television roles ranging from Rosalinde in the State Opera of South Australia's production of Strauss's <span class="italic">Die Fledermaus</span> in 1979, through Mrs Slocombe in Australian television's version of <span class="italic">Are You Being Served?</span> (from 1980), to the mother in Peter Williams's production of <span class="italic">Straight and Narrow</span> (1994). She published her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Merry Bronhill</span>, in 1987. She continued to work until 1995, when deafness caused by tinnitus forced her to retire. She was twice married: first, before leaving Australia for England, to Brian Martin, and second, in 1963, to the television producer Richard Finny, with whom she had one daughter. Both marriages ended in divorce. She died of breast cancer in Sydney, New South Wales, on 25 January 2005. She was survived by her daughter, Caroline.<br>
