<span class="headword">Waleys <span class="st"> [Wallensis]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1318&#150;1349), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and theologian</span>, joined the Dominican order in his youth and by 1318 was a bachelor of theology at Oxford. A three-year dispute between the university and the Dominicans prevented him from lecturing on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>. This has customarily been referred to 1311&#150;14, but Waleys is explicit that the dispute that affected him was heard before John XXII (<i>r</i>. 1316&#150;34), so it must have been the second one, in 1317&#150;20. Since it was only in December 1320 that the Dominicans were ready to accept a settlement, Waleys cannot have started lecturing on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> until 1321, so he can hardly have incepted as DD before 1323. In 1326 he was sent as lector to San Domenico, Bologna, since the pope wanted Benedetto da Como, who had been appointed, to go instead on a mission to the Greeks. The general chapter of 1327 attests Waleys's participation, as lector of Bologna, in a consultation on a point of Dominican law. In 1331 Richard Winkley, later provincial of England, was sent to Bologna, and Waleys became chaplain to the Dominican Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini in Avignon.<br>
<br>Waleys's surviving academic works, which include <span class="italic">Moralitates</span> on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and commentaries on part of the psalter and on books 1&#150;10 of <span class="italic">De civitate Dei</span>, show him to have been an observant and witty man, with a growing interest in classical antiquity, fostered particularly by the access to rare books that his time in Bologna and Avignon provided. In Beryl Smalley's judgement, his attitude to the classics was more objective and less moralizing than that of his contemporary Petrarch. Learning to approach his texts &#145;as a scholar, who has collated manuscripts and collected variants&#146;, Waleys &#145;steeped himself in primary sources and he gave exact references&#146;  (Smalley, 98, 100). As a teacher and preacher he was never afraid to speak his mind. In Italy he engaged in active polemic against the Franciscan views on poverty condemned by John XXII in 1323; he once went to Arezzo and personally broke up a gathering of allegedly heretical Franciscans. In Avignon, on 3 January 1333, he ventured to combine in one sermon a denunciation of several recognizably Franciscan &#145;heresies&#146; and a long refutation of the pope's own controversial theory about the beatific vision, especially as expounded by Cardinal Annibaldo da Ceccano. Neither the pope nor the Franciscans were explicitly named, but Waleys's clerical audience would have taken the point. At the end of the sermon he was carried away by his theme, as he admitted later, and made the unpremeditated claim that it was the hope of winning prompt success for their petitions at the papal court that most moved people to support the pope's theory of the beatific vision.<br>
<br>Within days Waleys was summoned before the local inquisitor, the Franciscan Guillaume de Montrond, who had him imprisoned. His position on the beatific vision was not challenged, but six propositions from his sermon were denounced as heretical. The affair became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, arousing intense interest in Paris; the French king himself followed it closely. Most people saw the hand of the pope in what had happened, but Waleys was more aware of the role of his Franciscan enemies, particularly Walter Chatton (<i>d</i>. 1343/4), and complained that he was being unfairly and dishonestly harassed. During a long lull in the proceedings against him he managed to smuggle out of his prison a further contribution to the debate sparked off by the pope's ideas on the beatific vision, a treatise <span class="italic">De temporibus et momentis</span> in which he elaborated on his most original theory, of the simultaneity of resurrection and judgement, and incidentally denounced as heretical a view that Chatton had propounded in a sermon. Waleys had eloquent supporters, including the master of the Sacred Palace, Armand de Belv&eacute;zer, who denied that he was guilty of any heresy; but his enemies were lined up against him. The non-schismatic Franciscans were naturally keen to show their loyalty to John XXII, and in any case they had theological reasons for finding the latter's views on the beatific vision more congenial than the Dominicans did; and the successive committees of masters called to discuss Waleys, while excluding those likely to be sympathetic to him, included outspoken supporters of the pope's theory, such as John Lutterell (<i>d</i>. 1335), who had incidentally been chancellor of Oxford during the dispute of 1317&#150;20 and represented the university against the Dominicans.<br>
<br>On 12 October Waleys appealed to the pope and was soon transferred to the papal prison. In February and March 1334 he appeared before a commission headed by two cardinals. After that the case seems to have lapsed without a verdict. Waleys was freed in August, but not allowed to leave Avignon. After his release he presumably took up residence in the Dominican priory. He did not return to Matteo Rosso Orsini's household, but he evidently remained on good terms with him. In 1336 Matteo's 27-year-old nephew, Tebaldo, was made archbishop of Palermo and he seems to have asked Waleys's advice about preaching. His reply was the readable and sensible <span class="italic">De modo et forma praedicandi</span>, in which he stresses content rather than style or form. His own recent experiences appear to have left him unperturbed: he advises Tebaldo that, although a preacher should not cause unnecessary offence, if the good of church or state requires it he must be fearless in his denunciation of wrongdoing. It has been argued that <span class="italic">De modo</span> was written after Waleys's return to England, but he cites something that happened &#145;in my country&#146;, which means he was writing outside England, and the dedication suggests that Tebaldo was still fairly new to his pastoral responsibilities; the second part of the treatise, a set of <span class="roman">Advent</span> sermons, is not necessarily based on the Sarum lectionary, as has been alleged, since the Dominican lectionary contained exactly the same readings. <span class="italic">De modo</span> was followed by another preachers' aid composed for Tebaldo, an alphabetic collection of patristic <i>sententiae</i> culled from the corpus of canon law, entitled <span class="italic">Campus florum</span>, and that seems to be the last thing Waleys wrote.<br>
<br>Probably after Clement VI became pope in 1342, Waleys was allowed to return to Oxford, where he made friends with a secular priest who was studying there, Lambert Poulshot. In 1349 he petitioned the pope to give his friend a benefice. Describing himself as &#145;broken by old age and struck down with paralysis&#146;  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 3. 1961), Waleys says that Lambert, from sheer kindness, is looking after him; otherwise he would be entirely destitute. Evidently the black death had left the Dominican community unable to cope. It is not known when Waleys died.<br>
