<span class="headword">Redfern,  Percy</span>  (1875&#150;1958), <span class="occ">journalist and historian of the co-operative movement</span>, was born in Leicester, the illegitimate son of a housekeeper. He was brought up by his father, Francis Redfern, who was an architect, and by his stepmother. The precise details of his background and early life are obscure but he was educated at various schools, including a dame-school, church school, and boarding-school in London, and Nottingham grammar school. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a Nottingham draper, an occupation that brought him into direct contact with the changing world of retailing and consumption. The harsh conditions of labour made a deep impression on him, as did the corrupt practices used by the trade to hoodwink gullible customers. He found the so-called &#145;religion of socialism&#146; immediately appealing and recalled in his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Journey to Understanding</span> (1946), how Robert Blatchford's weekly <span class="italic">Clarion</span> came as &#145;a message of life and joy&#146;  (Redfern, 20).<br>
<br>Redfern hated the living-in system common in the retail trade but continued with shop work, first in Coventry then London. He moved to the capital in 1895, joined the Social Democratic Federation and contributed to <span class="italic">Justice</span>. In 1896 he took a job in Huddersfield and became an active member of the Independent Labour Party, electioneering for Tom Mann, Keir Hardie, and Victor Grayson among others. For Redfern, like many of his generation, socialism constituted a form of community life and provided a source of meaning and hope. The most vivid passages in his autobiography convey how he and his comrades trained themselves &#145;in the faith&#146;  (Redfern, 38).<br>
<br>The most important turning point in Redfern's career came in 1899 when he obtained a clerical post with the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in Manchester. Soon after he became sub-editor then editor of <span class="italic">The Wheatsheaf</span>, the co-operative movement's monthly magazine. This publication was distributed free to local retail societies and had a circulation of nearly 0.5 million before the First World War. On 12 July 1905, at the Durham Road Unitarian Chapel, Altrincham, Redfern married Edith (<i>b</i>. 1878/9), daughter of John Gill Bridges Barber, cashier. He apparently enjoyed a happy family life, though few details are known.<br>
<br>Redfern immersed himself in co-operative history and theory and discovered the potential of the consumer through the life and speeches of the former chairman of the CWS, J. T. W. Mitchell, whose biography he later wrote. Reaching back to the Owenite roots of co-operation, Redfern soon came to regard the modern co-operative movement as a possible democratic utopia in embryonic form, built by organized consumers. Once converted, he communicated this view zealously throughout his subsequent writings. In an article for the <span class="italic">Co-operative Society Annual</span> in 1910, for example, he concluded: &#145;a first step toward a new social order is the organisation of the people by and for themselves, specially and definitely as consumers&#146;  (Redfern, 218).<br>
<br>The impact of total war, particularly profiteering on the home front, strengthened Redfern's belief that the consumer ought to be taken seriously. He rejected the majority socialist position that viewed consumers as a lost cause&#151;merely prey for cunning advertisers and retailers&#151;insisting instead that the potential of buyers to change the world was immense, if only they grasped the opportunity and organized themselves properly. He attempted to redefine the consumer for democratic economic and social change at greater length in his important manifesto <span class="italic">The Consumers' Place in Society</span> (1920), in which he baldly asserted: &#145;It is the consumer who stands at the gates of a new social order&#146;  (Redfern, 17). By this time he had thoroughly modified his earlier socialism that had prioritized state action and he looked forward to the spread of what he termed &#145;voluntary collectivism&#146;  (Gurney, 191).<br>
<br>The rest of Redfern's public life was devoted to co-operative propagandism. He had a real passion for the past and in <span class="italic">The Wheatsheaf</span> in 1911 he welcomed the growing interest in the history of the common people because it enabled co-operators, &#145;to remember that the present co-operative system is only the means to an end, and that the emancipation of the proletariat is of more consequence than an extra penny in the pound at the present time&#146;  (Gurney, 139). He went on to publish two major studies, <span class="italic">The Story of the C.W.S.</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">The New History of the C.W.S.</span> (1938), both well researched, readable works. Redfern was insistent that the movement should not be so inward looking and often stressed the importance of educating the wider society about the meaning and achievements of co-operation, not only the way it was effecting economic reform but also how it was producing a new culture in the process. &#145;We need to live in the movement, but not to bury ourselves in it&#146; was how he put it in his popular textbook published in 1914 on the eve of war, <span class="italic">Co-operation for All</span>  (p. 118). He retired from the CWS in 1938.<br>
<br>Redfern was a freethinker in his early life but later enthusiastically embraced Tolstoy's Christian anarchism; his first book (1907) was a study of the novelist's philosophy of life. He also took up vegetarianism (he was storekeeper for the Manchester Vegetarian Society for a while) and was a convinced pacifist. Eventually he found his spiritual home among the Society of Friends in Manchester. His faith in a complete co-operative utopia also mellowed with age, and in his autobiography he argued instead for a mixed economy  (Redfern, 161). He died from heart disease at The Retreat, York, on 11 February 1958 and was buried in the southern cemetery, Manchester. A memorial service was held at the Manchester Friends' meeting house.<br>
