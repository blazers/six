<span class="headword">Briscoe,  John Potter</span>  (1848&#150;1926), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born at Lever Bridge, Tonge with Haulgh, near Bolton, Lancashire, on 20 July 1848, the eldest son of John Daly Briscoe, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Scowcroft. He was educated at his father's school and was a teacher there from 1862 until 1866, when he was appointed assistant librarian in Bolton Public Library. Three years later, at twenty-one, he became chief librarian of Nottingham Public Library, a post he held for forty-seven years. He was twice married, first to Elizabeth Baxter of Bolton, then to Sophia Wallis of Nottingham.<br>
<br>Briscoe was an original member of the Library Association of the United Kingdom (established in 1877), a member of its council from 1881 to 1891, and a vice-president from 1891 to 1920. He further served the association as a summer school lecturer and enthusiastically supported its annual conferences, which he addressed frequently. In 1890 he helped to form the North Midlands Library Association, serving as its first president.<br>
<br>As a leading figure in the early development of professional librarianship, Briscoe wrote extensively on a variety of issues, especially those associated with promoting library services and extending them into society, to people who, because of their social or personal circumstances, made little use of them. His philosophy was that libraries should serve all, irrespective of class distinction or an individual's intellectual or physical limitations. He thus decried, for example, the lack of books for blind people in public libraries. He believed librarians had part of the missionary spirit in them and should not spare themselves in working for the common good. Public libraries, in particular, he held, had an important role to play in furthering education and assisting personal progress, enabling people to become good workers and worthy citizens.<br>
<br>Briscoe's contribution to the development of the library service in Nottingham was notable. After 1869, under his energetic leadership, the book stock of the central library expanded rapidly, a reference department was opened, and a system of branch reading rooms was put in place. In 1881 the central library moved into new premises. The town had been late in adopting the <span class="roman">Public Library Acts</span>, and at first lagged far behind industrial towns of comparable size; by the turn of the century, however, he had transformed Nottingham's library service into one of the country's leading library authorities.<br>
<br>One of the most striking features of this transformation was Briscoe's pioneering work in providing library services to children. He initiated the first separate children's service (for seven- to fourteen-year-olds) in the country. The Nottingham Library for Boys and Girls, comprising a stock of 3000 volumes and staffed by a dedicated female assistant, was opened in 1882 with the help of a &pound;500 donation from Samuel Morley, the hosiery manufacturer. Briscoe hoped to encourage reading among children by offering books that were well written, professionally printed, and attractively illustrated. Although he insisted that the material made available to children should be morally correct, it was not his intention to indoctrinate his younger readers according to a narrow moral code. Rather, his aim was to excite the imaginations of the young, so school textbooks were excluded from the children's library.<br>
<br>In 1890 Briscoe pioneered a series of half-hour talks to the public about books and writers, designed to assist people in their selection of books and encourage reading. For similar reasons he supported the idea of the reading circle (as operated by the National Home Reading Union, often in collaboration with public libraries), in which the public actively participated by reading and discussing selected works. His enthusiasm for talks and circles was derived from his belief that the increasingly hurried pace of life was resulting in too much light and scrappy reading, and that it was the duty of the librarian to counter the effects of a bustling age by guiding people to more advanced and contemplative, but equally pleasurable, literature.<br>
<br>Briscoe praised the work that public libraries began to undertake towards the end of the nineteenth century in acting as agents for the government's emigrants' information service, which aimed to advise those&#151;especially the poor and ignorant&#151;on matters that would protect them from the fraud, exploitation, and hardship that often accompanied the search for a new life in the colonies.<br>
<br>Briscoe was said to be a bookman born. He founded a local literary society, the Nottingham Sette of Odde Volumes, and was a member of the council of the Thoroton Society. His literary and scholarly interests were first and foremost in the field of local history. For many years he edited the local history column in the <span class="italic">Nottingham Weekly Guardian</span>. His extensive writings on Nottinghamshire history included <span class="italic">Bypaths of Nottinghamshire History</span> (1905), <span class="italic">A Concise History of Nottingham Castle</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Old Nottinghamshire</span> (2 vols., 1881&#150;4), <span class="italic">Chapters of Nottinghamshire History</span> (1908), <span class="italic">Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire at the Opening of the Twentieth Century</span> (1901), <span class="italic">Nottinghamshire Facts and Fancies</span> (1876), <span class="italic">A Popular History of Nottingham</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Contributions to a Bibliography of Hosiery and Lace</span> (1896), and <span class="italic">Stories about the Midlands</span> (1883). From 1892 he edited six volumes of <span class="italic">Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Notes and Queries</span>.<br>
<br>Beyond antiquarianism, Briscoe's literary interests were eclectic. He designed and edited <span class="roman">The Bibelots</span> (1899&#150;1907), a series of twenty-nine midget reprints of English classics. His <span class="italic">Gleanings from God's Acre</span> (1883) included a collection of epitaphs and Samuel Johnson's essay on the subject. He also published <span class="italic">Tudor and Stuart Love Songs</span> (1902). Aside from his literary endeavours, his recreations included gardening and photography.<br>
<br>At first glance, Briscoe's scholarly pursuits confirm the stereotype that emerged in the twentieth century of the librarian as a genteel, socially detached, literary recluse. However, in Briscoe's case this image is undermined by his active engagement in civil society, and the social and civic life of Nottingham in particular. His work and interests were furthered by intimate and dutiful associations with local citizens, bodies, and organizations. He was a staunch supporter of the temperance movement and for a number of years edited the <span class="italic">Midland Temperance Record</span>. Like many librarians of his time he was involved in freemasonry, his enthusiasm for the practice illustrated by his writings on the subject, which included <span class="italic">Notes on Early Freemasonry in Nottingham</span> (1924) and, for private circulation, &#145;Notes on some masonic degrees&#146; (1924).<br>
<br>Briscoe was forced to retire as librarian at Nottingham, owing to ill health, in 1916. On his retirement he was honoured with the position of consulting city librarian. He was succeeded as librarian by his only son, Walter Alwyn Briscoe (1878&#150;1934), like his father a leading advocate of library publicity and promotion. Hampered in later life by hardening of the arteries, Briscoe eventually suffered a serious cerebral haemorrhage and died at his home, 38 Addison Street, Nottingham, on 7 January 1926, having given over sixty years of service and support to libraries, local government, and a variety of reforming issues.<br>
