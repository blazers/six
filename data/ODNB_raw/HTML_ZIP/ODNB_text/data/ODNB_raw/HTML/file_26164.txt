<span class="headword">Spotswood <span class="st"> [Spottiswood]</span>,  Alexander</span>  (1676&#150;1740), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 12 December 1676 in Tangier, the son of Robert Spotswood (<i>d</i>. 1688), a physician serving with the English regiment, and his wife, Catherine, formerly Elliott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mercer (<i>d</i>. 1710). He came to England at the age of seven, one year before the garrison was abandoned, and was educated at Westminster School. His family&#151;Scottish, royalist, and members of the Church of England&#151;had seen better times than those of the 1680s, when anti-Scottish, anti-royal sentiments were sweeping the nation.<br>
<br>Patronage and opportunism marked Spotswood's distinctive military and political careers. He spent seventeen years in the army, receiving his first commission as an ensign in an infantry regiment in 1693 serving under the earl of Bath, and was promoted lieutenant in 1696. When wounded at Blenheim in 1704 he was already a captain. At Oudenarde in 1708 he was captured and exchanged.<br>
<br>In 1710 Spotswood was appointed lieutenant-governor of Virginia, sharing the salary with his army patron, titular governor George Hamilton, first earl of Orkney. At that time the colony faced problems on all sides. For five years Spotswood enjoyed the support of the colony's council but thereafter relations deteriorated. His attempt to reform the collection of land quitrents alienated Philip Ludwell and cut across the gubernatorial ambitions of the locally powerful William Byrd. Furthermore he unsettled the wily James Blair, commissary of the bishop of London, by attempting to use his full powers over the church. Conflicts over precedence, appointments, and the creation of a new court of oyer and terminer also undermined relations with the council. Relations with the lower house of the legislature were never good either. Spotswood's agenda was costly and his attitude towards the burgesses (members of the lower house) openly contemptuous. In 1718 a petition to the king signed by the speaker, Daniel McCarty, accused Spotswood of subverting the constitution and sought his removal.<br>
<br>Spotswood's efforts did have benefits, however. When the notorious pirate Edward Teach (Blackbeard) threatened to bottle up the colony's trade in 1718, Spotswood dispatched an expedition to Ocracoke Inlet, though outside his jurisdiction, which led to Teach's death. Thirteen of Teach's men were tried for piracy in Virginia and hanged. Spotswood sought not only to improve colonial defences but to reform abuses in trade with the Native Americans which he believed were a factor in the late war with the Tuscaroras. His policy towards the Native Americans was farsighted though ultimately unsuccessful. In 1714 he persuaded a number of smaller tribes to settle at Fort Christanna with support from the newly created Virginia Indian Company, which received a twenty-year monopoly on trade south of the James River. He also promoted a system of tobacco inspection and the construction of public warehouses in an attempt to boost Virginia's languishing economy. But the system undermined the interests of small planters, and it was further damaged by Spotswood's attempt to use it as a source of patronage by appointing sitting burgesses to agencies at salaries of &pound;250 a year. Most of his appointees were turned out at the next election in 1715, and in 1717 the privy council disallowed both the <span class="roman">Tobacco Inspection Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Indian Trade Act</span>. Lasting elements of Spotswood's time in office included the policy of settling foreign protestants on the Virginian frontier. He also carried forward the development of Williamsburg, originally laid out by Francis Nicholson, and his famous excursion across the Blue Ridge Mountains in 1716 captured the imagination of nineteenth-century writers.<br>
<br>Spotswood's career in Virginia illustrated the limitations on the exercise of royal power in the colonies even when in the hands of an able and dynamic official. His attempt to build a power base independent of the traditional sources of authority in the colony alienated Virginians, while his failure to consolidate his relationship with leading families made him vulnerable to complaints from both houses and lost him support among the merchant community in Britain. Caught between a hostile colonial assembly, their friends and representatives in London, and the ambivalence of British merchants, Spotswood was unable to realize many of his most cherished projects. Although relations with the assembly improved in the last years of his governorship, he was removed from office in 1722, by which time he had amassed vast landholdings in the colony. Spotswood spent the period 1724&#150;30 in England securing his land titles on favourable terms, not all of which had been patented in his name. In 1724 he married Anne Butler (<i>d</i>. 1750), daughter of Richard and Anne Brayne of St Margaret's, Westminster, with whom he had four children. In 1729 he was appointed postmaster-general at a salary of &pound;300 a year. Returning to Virginia in 1730, Spotswood lived the life of a Virginia planter, land speculator, and ironmaster. From his ironworks at Tubal he exported pig iron to England. When war broke out with Spain in 1739 Spotswood was appointed quartermaster-general and second in command to Charles, eighth Baron Cathcart. As colonel of the American regiment in 1740, he was travelling north to confer with colonial governors, when he fell ill at Annapolis, Maryland, where he died on 7 June 1740.<br>
