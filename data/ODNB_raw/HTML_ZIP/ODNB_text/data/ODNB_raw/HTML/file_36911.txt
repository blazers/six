<span class="headword">Willes, Sir  George Ommanney</span>  (1823&#150;1901), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29441/', "Captain George Wickens Willes RN (1785&#150;1846)")</script> and his wife, Anne Ellen, second daughter of Sir Edmund Lacon, first baronet, MP, was born at Hythe in Hampshire on 19 June 1823. He went to the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, in February 1836 and to sea in 1838. He passed his examination in September 1842, and as mate served in the <i>Cornwallis</i>, flagship of Sir William Parker, and in the brig <i>Childers</i> on the East Indies and China station. He was commissioned as lieutenant on 11 December 1844, and the following March was appointed to the <i>Hibernia</i>, again with Sir William Parker, then commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Three years later he was given command of the steamer <i>Spitfire</i> on the same station. In August 1850 he was appointed first lieutenant of the paddle-frigate <i>Retribution</i> in the Mediterranean, and was still in her at the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April 1854. Shortly afterwards he was promoted commander (dated 17 April), and on 1 June was moved into the flagship <i>Britannia</i> in which he served for the rest of the campaign, and notably at the bombardment of Fort Constantine, Sevastopol, on 17 October. He received the fifth class of the Mejidiye, and was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. Willes married, on 16 May 1855, Georgiana Matilda Josephine, daughter of William Joseph Lockwood of Dews Hall, Essex. In the Baltic campaign of 1855 he served on the flagship <i>Duke of Wellington</i>. He was promoted captain on 10 May 1856.<br>
<br>In February 1859 Willes was appointed to the <i>Chesapeake</i> as flag captain to Rear-Admiral James Hope, commander-in-chief in the East Indies, and in May 1861 followed his chief into the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>. Willes saw much active service during this commission. On 24 June 1859 he was in charge of the party sent to cut the boom across the Peiho (Beihe) River at the time of the unsuccessful attack, salved two stranded gun-vessels, and re-embarked the landing party. In August 1860 he was in command of the rocket-boats at the attack on the Peiho forts. For these services he received the China medal with the Taku clasp, and in July 1861 was made CB. In 1862 he was employed in investigating the creeks preliminary to operations against the Taiping, near Shanghai, and in July was relieved and returned home. In January 1864 he was appointed to command the ironclad <i>Prince Consort</i> in the channel squadron. In April 1866 he became captain of the reserve at Devonport, where he remained until called to the Admiralty as controller of the coastguard in January 1869.<br>
<br>As, in his Admiralty reform of 1869, Hugh Childers abolished the post of controller of the coastguard, Willes then occupied the post that developed into that of admiral-superintendent of naval reserves. In 1869 he and the registrar general of seamen, J. J. Mayo, conducted a departmental inquiry into the naval reserve regulations, recommending that the training period for paid reserves be considerably increased. In October 1870 Willes was given the title of chief of staff, responsible for reserves and several aspects of naval manpower. He also commanded the Reserve Fleet annual cruise. During his period at the Admiralty, Willes oversaw the creation of a modern and efficient reserve based on experienced naval personnel. He left this post in 1872. From April 1870 until his promotion to flag rank on 11 June 1874, he was an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>In May 1876 Willes became admiral-superintendent at Devonport, and on 1 February 1879 was advanced to vice-admiral. For three years from January 1881 he was commander-in-chief in China with his flag in the <i>Iron Duke</i>, and in May 1884 was made KCB. He was promoted admiral on 27 March 1885, and the following November was appointed commander-in-chief at Portsmouth; he thus commanded the fleet at Spithead at the 1887 jubilee review. He retired on 19 June 1888. In 1892 he was made GCB. He had been nominated a justice of the peace for Middlesex in 1884, and for many years, as a member of its council, played an active part in the Royal United Service Institution. He died at his London residence, 73 Cadogan Square, on 18 February 1901; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Willes was a strict and highly capable officer, equally successful on active service and in administrative duties, all of which he conducted with great skill. His service as chief of staff, his connection with the United Service Institution, and his support of the pioneer naval historian Sir John Laughton, who served with him in the <i>Prince Consort</i>, demonstrated his ability in the intellectual aspects of his profession.<br>
