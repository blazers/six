<span class="headword">Moffat,  Robert</span>  (1795&#150;1883), <span class="occ">missionary in Africa and linguist</span>, was born on 21 December 1795 in Ormiston, East Lothian, near Haddington, Scotland, the third of seven children of Robert Moffat (1768&#150;1847), and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardiner (1767&#150;1854). A pioneer of protestant missionary activity among the Tswana of southern Africa under the aegis of the London Missionary Society (LMS) and the first transcriber of seTswana, Robert Moffat had an important influence in Africa during his long sojourn there between 1817 and 1870. He helped to open the &#145;missionary road&#146; from the Cape north-eastward, which was important in southern African imperial politics from the middle to the late nineteenth century. In later life he helped to shape British conceptions of southern Africa before the South African War, extolling British imperial rule, criticizing Afrikaners (Boers), and portraying Africans as in need of Christianity and civilization. His voluminous private and official papers are an important record of the southern African interior before colonial rule.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Moffat's parents were stern Calvinists of modest means; his mother came from a poor Ormiston family and his father became a customs official in 1797 and moved his family to Portsoy, near Banff, to take up his first appointment. In 1806 the family moved to Carronshore, near Falkirk. Robert received a fairly sketchy education, particularly as he interrupted schooling to work on a coasting vessel. Giving up the sea, to his parents' relief, he was sent at the age of eleven with his elder brother Alexander for a final six months' education with a Mr Paton of Falkirk. About 1809 he was apprenticed as a gardener to the demanding John Robertson of Parkhill, Polmont. In 1811 his parents moved again, to Inverness, and in 1812 Moffat worked in the gardens of the earl of Moray, near Aberdour. The following year he became an under-gardener to Mr Leigh of High Leigh, Cheshire, and left Scotland for good.<br>
<br>In High Leigh, Moffat alarmed his parents by worshipping with Wesleyan Methodists. In nearby Warrington in 1815 he saw an advertisement for a missionary meeting; although the meeting was over, Moffat travelled to Manchester to consult the meeting's chairman, the Revd William Roby, about becoming a missionary. Roby became Moffat's mentor and found him a job in a nursery garden in Dukinfield, Lancashire, in order to spend a year instructing and observing him. Roby ultimately recommended Moffat to the directors of the interdenominational London Missionary Society (LMS), then in its early phase of accepting relatively uneducated candidates. After an initial refusal and some delay, the directors agreed to take on Moffat. In October 1816 he was ordained as an LMS missionary and set apart for Africa. He left the same month for the Cape of Good Hope and arrived on 13 January 1817.<br>
<br>The LMS directors then did not employ female missionaries, but they felt strongly that their missionaries ought to be accompanied by wives. Contrary to his employers' suggestions Moffat left for Africa alone, in love with Mary Smith, the daughter of his Dukinfield employer. In 1818 Mary was able to overcome her parents' objections to her marriage to Robert in distant Africa; she sailed in 1819 and the couple married in St George's Church, Cape Town, on 27 December 1819. They had ten children between 1821 and 1840; two died in early infancy and one aged seven. <a href="#cosubject_53699">Mary Moffat [<i>see below</i>]</a> also proved an indispensable partner in her husband's missionary endeavours.<h2>
<a name="CapeTownandGreatNamaLand"></a>Cape Town and Great Nama Land</h2>The British administration of Cape Colony viewed missionaries as troublemakers, thanks partly to LMS concern for the legal rights of non-Europeans. The British officials also worried about their seeming inability to control Khoi-Khoi (Hottentot) and coloured (mixed race) groups under missionary patronage to the north of the colony. So Governor Charles Somerset denied Moffat and three other recently arrived missionaries permission to leave Cape Colony. Moffat refused a position as government resident with a Xhosa chief and began to learn Dutch instead. Meanwhile he participated in a synod in 1817 run by a dissident faction of the LMS, which uncovered sexual scandals among its fellows. Among other things the synod revealed that the LMS southern African superintendent, the radical James Read, had an illegitimate child, having betrayed his Khoi-Khoi wife with the Khoi-Khoi daughter of a church deacon. A series of bitter quarrels split the LMS, presaging Moffat's lifelong opposition to the more politically radical wing of the LMS represented by Read and, later, John Philip.<br>
<br>In late 1817 Moffat was at last permitted to depart for Great Nama Land (in south-west Africa, later Namibia); he arrived in January 1818. He spent a year working with a Khoi-Khoi chief named Jaeger (Christian) Afrikaner in the vicinity of Warmbad. Like many others Afrikaner had fled Cape Colony, where he had been pressed into service; beyond the Cape boundaries he and his followers survived by raiding. He became a feared figure with a price on his head, though he had already fallen under missionary influence by the time Moffat was stationed with him, and had abandoned raiding. Moffat accompanied Afrikaner to Cape Town to meet Governor Somerset in a brilliant publicity coup which advertised the potential of missionaries for creating peaceful relations in the interior. During his time in south-west Africa Moffat also travelled extensively to the north with Afrikaner and to the east to visit Griquatown and Dithakong.<br>
<br>Back in Cape Town, Moffat met John Philip and John Campbell, sent out by the LMS to investigate the southern African mission's growing problems. The delegates persuaded Moffat to accompany them on a tour of inspection of the interior, which was truncated by frontier warfare.<h2>
<a name="ThesouthernTswanamissionearlyyears"></a>The southern Tswana mission: early years</h2>Philip appointed Moffat to replace the disgraced Read as mission head at Dithakong in Transorangia, among the Tlhaping, a southern Tswana group headed by Mothibi. Read, Ann and Robert Hamilton, and a number of converts from Read's mission station Bethelsdorp had pioneered this mission in 1815; it was about a hundred miles from Griquatown, and within the ambit of the Griqua. A multi-ethnic group including many immigrants, especially coloureds from Cape Colony with Khoi-Khoi mothers and white fathers, the Griqua had formed new polities, were professing Christians in contact with the LMS, and were allowed to buy arms from the colony. Colonial Khoi-Khoi assistance and LMS links to the powerful Griqua were thus essential to the survival of the mission.<br>
<br>At the outset neither the colonial government nor the Tlhaping themselves evinced much enthusiasm for the mission. Indeed the Moffats returned from an expedition to westerly Tswana villages to discover that Somerset had rescinded permission to settle at Dithakong. The couple waited in Griquatown until Somerset permitted them to return for good to Dithakong, on 17 May 1821. They found the Tlhaping angry about Read's dismissal. Furthermore, Mothibi's acceptance of missionaries stemmed mostly from a hope for material and diplomatic benefit, including access to the colonial arms trade. Inhabitants were relatively uninterested in Christianity throughout the 1820s, and many worried that the missionary presence was deterring rain. Moffat quite quickly established white control over the mission administration and undercut Read's influence by dismissing for moral turpitude certain Khoi-Khoi agents (by one of whom the Moffats' maid had become pregnant, for example) and establishing others firmly as servants rather than as the assistant missionaries James Read had designated them. Moffat also quarrelled with Mrs Hamilton, who was refusing to sleep with her husband, and encouraged her departure.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1820s regional conflict affected the Tswana mission. Late twentieth-century historians have debated this early nineteenth-century upheaval and the &#145;Cobbing thesis&#146; proposed by Julian Cobbing and others, which maintained that the destabilization formerly attributed to Zulu expansion was in fact fostered by white colonialism and by slave trading carried out in the Delagoa region by the Portuguese and, covertly, further south by the British, the Boers, and the Griqua. Moffat's actions loomed large in these debates because Cobbing contended that Moffat himself was trading slaves and that a key confrontation, the 1823 battle of Dithakong, fought in defence of the Kuruman mission, was in fact a slave raid co-ordinated by Moffat and other missionaries. So consideration of Moffat necessarily involves reference to local warfare and the historians' debates.<br>
<br>The region around Dithakong suffered in the 1820s from drought, hunger, the destabilizing impact of imported guns, and the competition of small mobile groups for survival, which disrupted the more settled communities. Moffat's mission escaped direct attacks in the early 1820s probably only because it was protected by the powerful Griqua. This was exemplified by the battle of Dithakong in 1823. When a mixed group of fugitives that Moffat called the Mantatees drove the more northerly BaRolong Tswana from their homes and seemed to threaten the mission, Moffat hastily gathered an armed and mounted Griqua commando under the leadership of Andries Waterboer. The resulting rout left some 400&#150;500 Mantatees dead. A number of women and children who had surrendered during this battle, and whom Moffat described as starving, were subsequently taken to Cape Town and to Griquatown and employed as labourers; Moffat himself added four servants to his household from among the women of the defeated group. There is no known evidence, however, that this battle was organized as a slave raid nor that Moffat was involved in slaving. By late 1823 his journals reported the Mantatees fleeing in all directions, apparently dying of hunger.<br>
<br>At the end of 1823 the Moffat family travelled to Cape Town to obtain medical advice for the ailing Mary and to consult with Dr Philip, now southern African superintendent. They took with them a local chief named Teysho, and Mothibi's heir Peclu; Moffat's hopes that Peclu would cement alliances between missionaries, the colony, and the Tlhaping were later to be dashed, on Peclu's death in 1825. On the group's return from the Cape in 1824, Moffat moved the mission to New Dithakong, later called Kuruman, by the Kuruman fountain. He began the arduous work of building houses, church, and gardens, and channelling the abundant waters of the Kuruman to irrigate the station. He saw this as a key step in &#145;civilizing&#146; the African landscape.<br>
<br>Over the next five years internecine conflict affected both the southern Tswana and the Griqua, and new raiding groups emerged, such as the dissident Griqua faction known as the Bergenaars. Violent political struggle marked the period. In 1825, for example, the Bergenaars threatened to drive the missionaries from Kuruman, though they never made the attempt. Other roving forces made serious depredations on the outskirts of Kuruman, one capturing and raping young Tswana women. Mothibi moved away from the station in 1825, his place temporarily taken by his brother Mahura as the Tlhaping chieftaincy fractured; Mothibi was to return in 1826 after being attacked by San (bushmen). Meanwhile, the powerful Ndebele (Matabele) left the ambit of Shaka Zulu to conquer new territory in the region, thereby sparking new conflicts. In 1827, the year in which the Moffats' first son, Robert, was born, the Bergenaars assaulted Griquatown itself, leading the newly vulnerable Moffats to flee Kuruman for a time. Internecine Griqua conflict quietened down once Waterboer's Griqua had defeated the Bergenaars, bolstered by renewed colonial support. In 1828 the inhabitants of Kuruman drove off an attack by armed Kora bandits. In December Kuruman was targeted by another, larger force, which sought revenge against a group sheltering at the station; Moffat persuaded the leader, a Nama chief known to him from Nama Land, to abandon the attack.<br>
<br>By now Moffat suspected that the Tlhaping saw the missionaries as barriers to their participation in the extensive illicit colonial trade in guns and ammunition. Certainly, missionary preaching was unpopular and attendance at the school had dwindled severely by the late 1820s. Even relationships with Griquatown proved fragile. By the beginning of 1829 Moffat had still baptized no converts. In 1829, however, Mothibi left the station permanently. Kuruman then became a haven for a mixed group of refugees, many of whom turned to Christianity in an emotional atmosphere. Also in 1829 the Ndebele chief Mzilikazi sent two of his head people to investigate Kuruman. Moffat gave them an escort through dangerous territory, and was then persuaded to continue on to meet Mzilikazi, with whom he was to form a lifelong bond.<br>
<br>Another turning point was Moffat's departure in 1830 for Cape Town, to have printed his translation into seTswana of the gospel of <span class="roman">St Luke</span>. Moffat had first produced a seTswana spelling book, printed in London in 1826, but had not until now made steady progress in <span class="roman">Bible</span> translation&#151;and indeed does not seem to have become fully fluent in seTswana until at best 1827. At Cape Town he was frustrated in his attempts to find a printer until the government lent its press, albeit without operating staff, to Moffat and his fellow missionary Rogers Edwards. The two colleagues printed their edition of <span class="roman">St Luke</span> themselves, under the supervision of B. J. Van der Sandt, though the effort so exhausted Moffat that he became ill and had to be carried on board ship for the return journey. When he and Mary returned to Kuruman in June 1831 they brought with them some tools to entrench Christianity and &#145;civilization&#146;: a hand printing-press which Moffat was now able to use, cloth from Manchester with which Mary began to fashion long dresses for Tswana women, and a mason, Mr Millen, who helped to build a permanent church.<br>
<br>The early 1830s were calmer than the 1820s, despite fighting between Griqua groups and the Ndebele, and the death in 1832 of the Moffats' infant daughter Elizabeth, who had been born in Cape Town. In 1835 an expedition led by the scientific explorer Dr Andrew Smith reached Kuruman. Smith cared for Mary Moffat, herself close to death after the birth of another son. Moffat then accompanied Smith on another visit to Mzilikazi's headquarters, during which he persuaded Mzilikazi to accept American protestant missionaries.<br>
<br>By the mid-1830s disaffected Afrikaner groups trekking away from British hegemony at the Cape had begun to disrupt the interior. In 1837 serious conflict broke out between Afrikaners and the Ndebele. When the American missionaries left with an Afrikaner raiding party, Mzilikazi's suspicion that they were spies deepened and the mission was doomed. Under a dual threat from the Zulu king Dingaan, Shaka's murderer and successor, and from trekking Afrikaners, the Ndebele migrated to the territory which became named after them, Matabeleland. The 1830s were also marked by bitter conflict between LMS missionaries and Christianized Griqua over who should spearhead missions in the region, as the Griqua sought to expand their political influence through Christianization of the Tswana.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoBritain"></a>Return to Britain</h2>In 1838 the Moffats left for Cape Town, where they hoped to recuperate their failing health and to print a seTswana <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. When printing there proved impossible they decided to go to England. Just after they boarded ship another daughter was born; three days later, their six-year-old son James died, a victim of a measles epidemic. After a three-month sea voyage the family arrived in Britain in June 1839 to find that Robert Moffat had become a public figure. He was lionized in evangelical circles, as he travelled the country proselytizing for missions, and he persuaded the young David Livingstone to undertake missionary work among the Tswana. In 1840 Livingstone and another young missionary, William Ross, left to reinforce the Tswana mission.<br>
<br>During this fruitful three-year sojourn Moffat printed his seTswana <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. In 1842 his <span class="italic">Missionary Labours and Scenes in Southern Africa</span> appeared, to become a widely read Victorian missionary classic. Moffat also published several missionary sermons, including his <span class="italic">African Scenes</span> (1843).<br>
<br>The Moffats sailed again for South Africa on 30 January 1843, following valedictory services, addresses, and presentations, and accompanied by a further two young men going out as missionaries. They left some of their children in Britain for education. During a pause on their return journey, Moffat took a tour of the eastern Cape missions of the LMS. The party was met by David Livingstone at the Vaal River, and returned to Kuruman at last in December 1843.<h2>
<a name="ThesouthernTswanamissionlateryears"></a>The southern Tswana mission: later years</h2>By the time the Moffat party returned to Kuruman, it was home to several other white missionaries. Indeed, Livingstone would soon be complaining of poor relationships among the quarrelsome denizens of Kuruman. Once most of this group dispersed to work among the Tswana elsewhere, Kuruman became its members' base of operations, as well as the source of a wide range of religious material in seTswana as literacy grew in importance among the Tswana. Kuruman spearheaded the missionary, and ultimately imperial, expansion into Tswana territory.<br>
<br>In 1844 Livingstone was attacked by a lion and returned to Kuruman to convalesce. In January 1845 he married Moffat's eldest daughter, Mary. In 1846, after a bitter quarrel between Livingstone and Rogers Edwards, the Livingstones established a new station at Chonuane where David worked (and quarrelled) with the Tswana chief Sechele. Mary Livingstone soon fell seriously ill; her mother travelled to Chonuane to nurse her. In 1847 Moffat's elderly father died in Scotland.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the displacement and subjugation of Tswana groups by Afrikaner trekkers from the Cape accelerated, from the mid-1840s onward. In 1848 Sir Harry Smith proclaimed the Orange River Sovereignty, giving the British putative control over the region between the Orange and Vaal rivers; this lent impetus to Afrikaner migration to the Transvaal region, to land which had recently been vacated by the Ndebele. The Sand River Convention (1852) between the British government and the Transvaal settlers directly threatened LMS mission fields by guaranteeing settlers internal self-government (on condition that they did not participate in slaving nor move south of the Vaal), as well as by granting them an open market in gunpowder. Groups among whom the LMS were working, including Sechele's Kwena, were attacked and in some cases dispersed by the trekkers, while Livingstone's new station at Kolobeng was a casualty of conflict. Moffat argued passionately in letters to the LMS and to the press that the Transvaalers used the Sand River Convention to claim hegemony over a vast area of land, and that the convention permitted them to kill, dispossess, and rape with impunity. Conflict between the LMS and Afrikaner communities in the region was exacerbated by the attempt of nascent Afrikaner polities to enforce an embargo on the sale of arms and ammunition to non-European groups; both Livingstone and Moffat had provided guns, gunpowder, and gun repair to Africans in the past, albeit on a much smaller scale than Afrikaners alleged. Many Afrikaners accused missionaries of continuing a long LMS tradition of illegitimate interference in Afrikaner affairs; many black Africans attacked the missionaries as, at best, powerless pawns of a British government which tacitly acquiesced in the Afrikaner takeover, and, at worst, as having opened the door to white incursions.<br>
<br>By 1853 the British had decided to withdraw from the abortive Orange River Sovereignty. Moffat chaired an LMS committee which produced a memorial pleading with the newly arrived British representative, Sir George Clark, that the British not abandon the sovereignty and that Christian missions be permitted to continue their work. Moffat travelled to Bloemfontein to present this memorial to Clark, but predictably it had little effect. In 1854 the Bloemfontein Convention established the Afrikaner Orange Free State. Conflict shut down the possibility of LMS expansion into the Transvaal region and compelled missionaries to withdraw from some existing stations. By the mid-1850s Moffat was also reporting a falling away of converts and influence at Kuruman. The British were widely hated, he claimed, and the influence of British missionaries was declining.<br>
<br>Throughout these trials Moffat continued to translate the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. It was indeed with the partial aim of rectifying the health problems he attributed to excessive study that Moffat set out in May 1854 with Tswana attendants and two young British traders to visit Mzilikazi once again and to contact the peripatetic Livingstone. Once Moffat's party reached Mzilikazi, the Ndebele monarch gave further unusual displays of affection towards Moffat, who was able to spend much of his visit in the king's presence observing his management of the kingdom. Moffat also tried to cure Mzilikazi of a debilitating illness which the missionary diagnosed as dropsy. When Moffat tried to leave to deliver supplies to Livingstone, Mzilikazi at first sought to detain Moffat and then decided to accompany Moffat himself. On the verge of dangerous tsetse fly country, Mzilikazi dispatched a Ndebele team to transport Livingstone's effects to him and the larger group turned back.<br>
<br>In 1857 Moffat at last completed his translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Meanwhile the LMS had decided to establish new stations among two antagonistic groups, the Kololo and the Ndebele, and Moffat was asked to spend a year founding the Ndebele mission. Moffat made a further journey to Mzilikazi, obtaining grudging permission to establish a station. He also won from Mzilikazi the return of the putative heir to the Ngwato kingdom, Macheng, whom the Ndebele had captured in battle many years before; what Moffat did not know, however, was that the dispute over Macheng's chieftainship would lead to extensive factional conflict among the Ngwaketse.<br>
<br>In 1858 the Moffats travelled to Cape Town with Livingstone, about to leave on his Zambezi expedition. There they met three of their children returning from study in England, including John Smith Moffat, recently hired by the LMS as a missionary to the Ndebele, and his new wife, Emily. After a difficult and thirsty journey back, Robert Moffat found conflict raging between Tlhaping and Afrikaner groups. He petitioned Governor Grey on behalf of the Tlhaping, whose land he felt the Afrikaners were trying to steal. In return he was accused of gun-running by Afrikaner leaders, and threats were made against Kuruman. Intervention by Grey on Moffat's behalf forced settlers to permit Moffat to travel to the Ndebele, despite initial threats to stop the expedition.<br>
<br>In late 1858 missionaries designated for the Ndebele and the Kololo converged on Kuruman, to set out in 1859 with Tswana assistants. Once the Ndebele mission had reached Mzilikazi, however, Moffat discovered that, as he had feared, the chief had not thought his earlier vague concessions to Moffat would amount to much in practice. Indeed, the intense conflict among the Ndebele (fuelled by recent contact with disaffected Tlhaping), over whether to accept the missionaries, indicates the contemporary controversy among the Africans over the costs and benefits of missions; it was argued that mission stations opened the way to Afrikaner incursions and compelled converts to abandon polygamy. None the less, Mzilikazi finally (though reluctantly) agreed to the establishment of the Inyati mission&#151;a critical step in developing the relationships between the Ndebele and the British, and which eventually included the incorporation of the Ndebele into British Rhodesia. Moffat remained for some months, helping to build houses and to plant food for the mission. Meanwhile fever killed a young Tswana assistant, Marelole.<br>
<br>Shortly after Moffat's return in August 1860 to Kuruman, he heard that the Kololo mission had ended in disaster: three children and one missionary couple had died at the station, some said of fever and others said of poisoning at the hands of Chief Sekeletu. The surviving white missionary, Richard Price, who believed the poison story, had fled the station with his wife, the two children of the dead couple, and his Tswana assistants. Mrs Price had died on 5 July, before the survivors met their colleague John Mackenzie. Moffat rushed to escort the returning party back to Kuruman.<br>
<br>In 1861 Moffat's daughter Elizabeth married Price and went to work with him among the Kwena. Missions in the southern African interior were a Moffat family enterprise: in addition to Mary's marriage to Livingstone and John Smith Moffat's work at Inyati, another daughter, Ann, was married to the French missionary Jean Fr&eacute;doux. However, in 1862 Mary Livingstone died of fever in the Zambezi, for which her mother blamed Livingstone; another Moffat child, Charles, died in the same year; and in 1866 Jean Fr&eacute;doux was accidentally killed during an altercation with a white trader, and the Moffats became responsible for Ann and her seven children.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>In 1870 Robert and Mary Moffat finally and reluctantly retired to Britain in the company of their youngest daughter, feeling unsure whether or not it was really their home. After a tour of friends and relations, they settled for six months in Brixton, London, at the home of Henry Vavasseur. In January 1871 Mary Moffat died, in Brixton, following a very brief illness.<br>
<br>Moffat then spent two and a half years without a permanent address, travelling around Britain with his daughter, preaching and raising money for the missionary cause, including the Moffat Institute, a Tswana seminary. In 1872 the University of Edinburgh made him an honorary doctor of divinity. In January 1873 he settled at last at 64 Knowle Road, Brixton, his residence for the next seven years. Despite advancing age he nevertheless continued to travel around Britain to popularize missions. He also continued to work on seTswana material, producing a hymn book.<br>
<br>In 1874 Moffat travelled to Southampton to meet the ship bearing David Livingstone's remains and to identify his body. In 1877 he went to Paris for three weeks, and spoke to four thousand French schoolchildren. In November 1879 he left London for the countryside, finding pleasure in his garden and in village life, at Leigh, near Tonbridge. He followed southern African affairs closely, and often longed to return; the British retrocession of the Transvaal to Afrikaners after the 1881 Anglo-Transvaal War depressed him deeply. Moffat was much honoured throughout these final years. In 1873 a subscription for him raised some &pound;5000. He had a brief meeting with Queen Victoria at the unveiling of a statue of David Livingstone in 1876, and he breakfasted with Gladstone in 1876 and 1878.<br>
<br>Robert Moffat died peacefully at Park Cottage, Leigh, on 8 August 1883. He was buried in Norwood cemetery, London, on 16 August, alongside his wife, Mary.<br>
<br>Robert Moffat's wife, <a name="cosubject_53699"></a><span class="headword">Mary Moffat</span>  (1795&#150;1871)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in New Windsor, Lancashire, the eldest of the four children of James Smith (1763&#150;1853), a Scottish gardener, and his English wife, Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray, from York. Mary, like her father, was an Independent (her mother was Anglican); her brother John became a pastor near Manchester and later a missionary at Madras. She was educated at a Moravian school at Fairfield, Lancashire, and fell in love with Robert Moffat when he was working as a gardener in her father's nursery garden at Dukinfield, Lancashire. Moffat was then under the tutelage of William Roby in anticipation of his future posting with the LMS. Mary Smith felt herself torn on the one hand between her family obligations as a dutiful only daughter and on the other her love for Robert and strong sense of religious obligation to work as a missionary. In this she confronted some of the contradictions of evangelical prescriptions for women, as well as the problem of whether evangelical marriage was primarily for love or duty. She had a painful two years during which she was her parents' companion but with the understanding with Robert that she would join him at some unspecified time. At one point she broke off the relationship, consumed by guilt towards her mother and worried by news of various sexual scandals among the southern African missionaries. Ultimately, however, the difficult decision to part with her parents was made and her marriage to Robert took place. She never saw her mother again, nor saw her father for some twenty years: being a woman missionary in the early nineteenth century demanded an abrogation of certain family duties as contemporaries perceived them.<br>
<br>Mary Moffat was indispensable to the family missionary enterprise and became well known in evangelical circles as the archetypal missionary wife, dispensing domesticity and &#145;civilization&#146; to Africa. This image was later bolstered by John Smith Moffat's biography of his parents, <span class="italic">The Lives of Robert and Mary Moffat</span> (1886) and by Mary Moffat's status as David Livingstone's mother-in-law. She embodied some of the contradictions of certain evangelical ideas about women: she took a public role as a protestant evangelist in Africa, and yet was celebrated in Britain as an angel of the domestic sphere&#151;as support to her husband, as a teacher of sewing and model of domestic virtue to Tswana girls and women, and as dispenser of food and home comforts to travelling male missionaries. However, it is unclear whether the Tswana so perceived her, and her long-term significance perhaps lay as much in her image among the Victorians as in her actual daily work. Nevertheless, Mary Moffat was important in fostering Christian proselytization in southern Africa. She led and taught women's groups, educated her own children when young, planted the garden, made food, took care of Robert when he was sick, and kept the mission station going when he was absent. She also corresponded extensively with people in England and Scotland, and with Robert during his frequent absences; moreover, her letters furnish an important source of information about the southern African interior in the mid-nineteenth century. From 1839 to 1842, when the family were in Britain, she not only took care of the children but also fostered female evangelical networks.<br>
<br>During the thirty years before the Moffats' final return to Britain, Mary remained based at Kuruman. She travelled extensively without Robert, mostly to visit her children. She had a cordial but vexed relationship with David Livingstone, who had married her eldest daughter, Mary, in 1845. John Smith Moffat later recalled that in 1858 his mother was convinced that Mary Livingstone would not return alive from the Zambezi expedition planned by Livingstone, and she had travelled to Cape Town to say goodbye to her. After Mary Livingstone died of fever in the Zambezi in 1862, her mother blamed Livingstone for having brought her there, just as she had many years earlier blamed Livingstone for the death of his six-week-old daughter Elizabeth. Despite internal tensions, however, Mary Moffat was a lynchpin of the Moffat and Livingstone family missionary enterprise, and several of her own children became missionaries in Africa, and many of their descendants became important figures in the white settler communities of Rhodesia and South Africa.<br>
<br>Mary Moffat's life also illustrates some of the difficulties of childbirth and child rearing then faced by women. Her first child, Mary, was born in 1821; her tenth, Jane Gardiner, in 1840, by which time she had suffered miscarriages and the deaths of three of her children. Shortly after the death of her first son, Robert, she adopted and nursed a Tswana baby girl abandoned near Kuruman, whom she and her husband named Sarah Roby, after Robert's mentor William Roby. Like other white missionary women of the period, Mary Moffat sent her children away for education for long periods&#151;a particular irony, given her status as an iconic mother and proffered gender role-model for the Tswana. She was convinced that this was God's will, just as she herself had left her parents. Her eldest children, Mary and Ann, were sent to school in Grahamstown in 1830 aged nine and seven respectively, and they saw their parents only sporadically during their several-year sojourn there. Many years later, in 1847, the year of her father-in-law's death, Mary Moffat took her three youngest children, aged about thirteen, eight, and seven, by ox-wagon to Cape Colony in search of opportunities for education; one of them, John Smith Moffat, attested in his joint biography of his parents that this was an excruciating task for his mother, to which she was reluctantly persuaded by her husband and by David Livingstone; &#145;there was a pathetic tenderness&#146;, he claimed, &#145;in the interest which the mother took in the wild flowers and curious pebbles which the children gathered on the hill-sides and in the stoney river-beds&#146; on the long journey to the Cape  (J. S. Moffat, 261). Mary Moffat eventually put the children on a ship to England, and did not see her daughter Bessie again for eight years, nor John and Jane for eleven.<br>
<br>By the time Mary and Robert Moffat left Kuruman in 1870 to retire to Britain, Mary had become increasingly feeble; she had needed help in running the domestic side of the station for some time. She died shortly after arriving in Britain, at Brixton, London, on 9 January 1871, and was buried in Norwood cemetery, London.<br>
