</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pasmore,  (Edwin John) Victor</span>  (1908&#150;1998), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 3 December 1908 at Chelsham House, Chelsham Road, Surrey, the eldest son of Edwin Stephen Pasmore (1866&#150;1927), physician and specialist in mental diseases, and Gertrude Eva Screech (1884&#150;1974), amateur painter. His early life was comfortable, and the milieu in which he grew up was artistic&#151;not only did his mother paint, but his father was a man of taste who collected objects of virtu. His younger brother Stephen recalls him single-mindedly drawing battleships and aeroplanes in the nursery during the First World War. Pasmore's evident passion for painting was encouraged to such an extent that while at Harrow School (1922&#150;6) he painted a competent copy of Landseer's <span class="italic">Dignity and Impudence</span>.<br>
<br>The art master at Harrow, Maurice Clarke, proceeded to introduce Pasmore to the work of the French impressionists, but the boy was equally impressed by Rembrandt and the late works of Turner, and was fascinated by the conceptual side of art as instanced in Leonardo's notebooks and Joshua Reynolds's <span class="italic">Discourses</span>. He tried to paint what he saw, mainly landscape and still life. The sudden death of his father in 1927 deprived Pasmore of all immediate hopes of becoming a professional artist, and he became a clerk in the public health department of the London county council.<br>
<br>Pasmore worked for the London county council for ten years, refusing all promotion so that he might reserve his energies for painting in his spare time. From 1927 until 1931 he attended evening classes at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under A. S. Hartrick, a cosmopolitan figure who had known Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Lautrec. In 1931 he began to show with the London Group, and in 1932 he joined the London Artists' Association. Pasmore continued his self-education largely through copying the masters, at this point taking the Fauve paintings of Matisse and Bonnard as examples, and holding his first solo show. He began to mix with the British avant-garde, made lasting friendships with William Coldstream and Claude Rogers, and experimented with abstraction rather before he properly understood it, participating, with Ivon Hitchens and Ceri Richards among others, in a ground-breaking exhibition, &#145;Objective abstractions&#146;, at Zwemmer's Gallery (1934).<br>
<br>Although impressed by the abstractions of Ben Nicholson, Pasmore returned to traditional naturalism, under the influence of Sickert and Bonnard, and destroyed his early abstract efforts. The depression of the 1930s saw the development of realistic art with a social conscience, and Pasmore soon became involved with his friends Rogers and Coldstream in founding the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64717/', "Euston Road School")</script> to teach these new principles. Pasmore, however, was more drawn to the discipline of measuring with a plumb line, that is to say towards a science of objective picture making, than to any specific social or political stance. He was now able to give up his job with the London county council, largely because of the enlightened patronage of Kenneth Clark, newly appointed director of the National Gallery, who undertook to pay Pasmore a stipend in return for paintings. This open show of support made all the difference to the young artist, and his work assumed increasing authority.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1940 Pasmore married the artist Wendy Blood (<i>b</i>. 1915), with whom he had two children. At the outset of the Second World War, the Euston Road School was dissolved and Pasmore registered as a conscientious objector. None the less he was conscripted in October 1941, trained as an NCO and earned something of a reputation as a marksman. He was subsequently sent for guards officer cadet training at Sandhurst, whereupon he once more proclaimed himself a conscientious objector and walked out of barracks. He was declared a deserter and imprisoned for six months. Finally, in September 1942, after appearing before a number of tribunals, he was completely exempted from military service and allowed to get back to his painting.<br>
<br>The influences of Whistler, Conder, and Japanese prints are discernible in Pasmore's work of this period, but Chinese painting, particularly of the Song dynasty, was also a key inspiration. Bombed out of their flat in Ebury Street in 1941, the Pasmores stayed with friends and Victor buried himself in the writings of C&eacute;zanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. He pondered colour theory and was fascinated by what he saw as the gap between the paintings and the ideas of the post-impressionists. His own work developed. The apparently pointilliste paintings of the Thames at Chiswick, with which he rapidly made a name for himself, have strong curvilinear frameworks that suggest a spiral movement. This may owe something to Turner, and it was a motif to which Pasmore returned.<br>
<br>In 1943 Pasmore took up the post of visiting teacher at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. He was an inspiring tutor, remembered with affection by such diverse students as Terry Frost and Euan Uglow, and continued working there until 1949, after which he worked at the Central School for five years. In 1954 he was appointed director of painting in the School of Fine Art, King's College, University of Durham, a post he held until 1961. Meanwhile his painting had undergone what many saw as a &#145;road to Damascus&#146; conversion: Pasmore had &#145;gone abstract&#146;.<br>
<br>Pasmore's landscape paintings had become increasingly tentative and abstract, and the seminal Picasso exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum (1945&#150;6) had emphasized what he interpreted as the crisis in modern painting. Instead of returning to fauvism or cubism, however, Pasmore pursued a more independent abstract mode after the example of Klee, Mondrian, and Ben Nicholson. The period 1947 to 1951 was largely transitional, with Pasmore making and exhibiting abstract paintings and collages. Then in 1951 he made his first abstract reliefs, announcing that easel painting was dead. Shock was general. The influential critic and general arbiter of taste Herbert Read called it the most revolutionary event in post-war British art, and opinion was split. Pasmore, a gifted public speaker with a touch of the prophet, enjoyed the notoriety, and in writing, lecturing, and teaching, set about the promulgation of his revised views.<br>
<br>Pasmore showed considerable courage in &#145;going abstract&#146; just at the point when he was establishing a reputation as a realist painter. In fact his work had become increasingly concerned with structure and pattern, light and space, shape and colour, and the only way forward he could detect was in terms of abstract form. He became even more active as a teacher, running a department at Durham specifically devoted to research and experiment into the language of abstract form. His influence, combined with that of his colleagues Harry Thubron and Richard Hamilton, changed art education. Even more concretely, Pasmore was appointed consultant architectural designer (1955&#150;77) for the development of part of Peterlee New Town, co. Durham, which enabled him to design constructivist art on a scale one could walk through.<br>
<br>Pasmore had too restless an intelligence to sit for long on his laurels. By the mid-1960s he felt that geometrical reliefs were too limiting, and he returned to painting. He thought of himself as a modern romantic, and always talked of the modern revolution in painting which involved for him a synthesis of objective representation with subjective freedom of expression. To this end he developed a rich abstract language of line and colour, taking universal symbols from nature such as the spiral and interlocking shapes (derived from waves and swirling snow), and employing a variety of marks from the stippled to the sprayed, but generally suggestive of organic form. His work was lyrical, essentially musical, intuitive, full of clouds of evocative colour and a wandering though exact line.<br>
<br>In 1964 Pasmore made his first graphics, and for the rest of his life printmaking was a central part of his working practice. Unfailingly inventive, he worked with a number of different print workshops in London and in Rome, producing a steady stream of etchings and screen prints. Sometimes these were combined with the mystical or romantic poetry he liked to write. He was never idle, acquiring a house and studio in Malta in 1966, and making environmental paintings in the courtyards there from piled blocks of rough-hewn honey-coloured stone, daubed paint on walls, and a painted swimming-pool in which, on occasion, would float a solitary orange from an overhanging tree. One courtyard became a refuge for all the stray cats of the island, others were open-air studios. Towards the end of his life Pasmore reintroduced figurative imagery into his paintings, making copies of pictures by Picasso and Turner, and creating allegories of man's relationship with his environment. He never ceased to experiment and push beyond the boundaries of his art, and this was his lasting strength.<br>
<br>Pasmore was rewarded with international sales and celebrity, and with honours in Britain. In 1959 he was made CBE and in 1981 Companion of Honour, and he was elected a Royal Academician in 1983. Among his many exhibitions were retrospectives at the Tate Gallery in 1965 and 1980, at the Yale Center for British Art in 1988, and at the Serpentine Gallery in 1991. In 1990 he selected &#145;The artist's eye&#146; at the National Gallery. He was not noted for his diplomatic skills. When he first met Kenneth Clark, who became one of his staunchest supporters, Clark was trying a new frame on one of the Turners in the National Gallery. Pasmore told him abruptly that he had no taste. Yet they became friends. For all his brusqueness and quasi-military bearing&#151;the gruff delivery and the barking laugh&#151;Pasmore could be immensely charming. There was humour in his bright black eyes, as well as intelligence. If there was obstinacy in his make-up, it was the very quality which ensured that his career took the unusual and rewarding course that it did. He died, survived by his wife, at his home, Dar Gamri, at Gudja in Malta, on 23 January 1998, and was cremated at Kensal Green four days later. His work is held in many public collections including the Tate, Manchester City Art Gallery, Leeds City Art Gallery, Wakefield City Art Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Aberdeen Art Gallery, the Arts Council, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide.<br>
