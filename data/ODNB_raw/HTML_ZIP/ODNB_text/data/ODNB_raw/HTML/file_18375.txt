<span class="headword">Maulay <span class="st"> [Malo Lacu]</span>,  Peter (I)  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1241), <span class="occ">knight and royal councillor</span>, took his name from Maulay in France, in the border region separating the provinces of Poitou and the Touraine. The identity of his father and mother remains unknown. By contemporaries it was said that he had risen from relatively humble origins, and that he abandoned his estates in France to his younger brother, Aimery de Maulay. Peter de Maulay is first recorded in 1202, granted land in the region of Loudun by King John. According to the chronicler Walter of Guisborough (likely to be a good source, though late, thanks to Guisborough's proximity to Maulay's castle at Mulgrave), it was Maulay, acting on royal orders, who carried out the murder of the king's nephew, Arthur, duke of Brittany, last heard of in 1203. Certainly Maulay enjoyed the close confidence of the king and came to be numbered among John's evil counsellors by the chronicler Roger of Wendover. Following the loss of Normandy in 1204 he joined the king in England. There he received a series of royal escheats, including the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. In 1213 he travelled as royal ambassador to Rome, and in the following year played a leading role in the king's expedition to Poitou, where he took command of the garrison of La Rochelle. In the same year, in return for a proffer of 7000 marks, he was granted the marriage and lands of Isabella, sole daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27884/', "Robert of Thornham (d. 1211)")</script>, a former royal seneschal of Poitou. The fine was later pardoned in return for Maulay's services to the crown. By his marriage Maulay rose to a leading position among the Yorkshire baronage, with control over the Fossard barony, with its 30 knights' fees and its honour divided between Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Mulgrave in Cleveland.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of civil war in 1215 Maulay was appointed constable of Corfe Castle in Dorset, with custody of the king's treasure and of King John's youngest son, Richard, the future earl of Cornwall. At Corfe, Maulay acted as gaoler to many state prisoners, including Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1241), the sister of Arthur of Brittany, and several barons captured during the civil war, from whom he extracted heavy ransoms and whom he retained in prison long after the end of hostilities, an action that earned him widespread dislike. Appointed sheriff of Dorset and Somerset in 1216, he failed to respond to the orders of the royal exchequer and instituted a regime of profiteering at the expense of the local gentry. In 1220 he was forced to relinquish custody of Richard of Cornwall, and in the following year, in a coup orchestrated by the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1243), Maulay was accused of treasonably plotting with the French, and was stripped of his offices. He retired to his estates in Yorkshire, where from around 1220 he was engaged in building a new castle at Mulgrave. In 1230 he served on the king's expedition to Brittany, and returned to court in 1232 as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his fellow alien, Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1238).<br>
<br>In the following year Henry III restored him to possession of the manor of Upavon, seized back by the crown following Maulay's disgrace, and since conferred upon Gilbert Basset by royal charter. Maulay's restoration to Upavon was widely considered an illegal exercise of royal power, and precipitated a revolt by Basset and his overlord, Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1234). Despite temporary disgrace Maulay survived the ensuing storm, and in 1236 was briefly appointed sheriff of Northamptonshire. Having taken the cross as long ago as 1220, in 1241 he set out on crusade together with his former ward, Richard of Cornwall. He died, probably in the Holy Land, later that same year. Although mistrusted as an alien by the native English baronage, his marriage to Isabella of Thornham, who predeceased him, established Peter de Maulay and his descendants as major Yorkshire landowners. Maulay himself bestowed land upon several local monasteries, including Meaux, where he founded a chantry in memory of his wife. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Peter (II) Mauley (<i>d</i>. 1279), the ancestor of a succession of Mauley lords of Mulgrave [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54530/', "Mauley family")</script>]. The Mauley coat of arms, recorded by Matthew Paris, combined a maunch, probably Peter's original coat, with the Fossard arms: or, a bend sable.<br>
