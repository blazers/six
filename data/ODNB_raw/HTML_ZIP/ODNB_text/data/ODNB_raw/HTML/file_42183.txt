<span class="headword">Dick,  Quintin</span>  (1777&#150;1858), <span class="occ">politician and socialite</span>, was born in March 1777 in Dublin, the eldest of four children of Samuel Dick (<i>d</i>. 1802), East India proprietor and merchant, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Nicholas Forster of Tullaghan, co. Monaghan, Ireland. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA in 1797, he became a barrister of King's Inns, Dublin, in 1800. He began his long parliamentary career as nominee of a relative, sitting in 1800 for Dunleer in the Irish parliament. He opposed the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. After inheriting his father's wealth in 1802, however, he entered the British parliament by purchase at West Looe, Cornwall, a seat he held from 1803 to 1806.<br>
<br>Dick became celebrated more for his political dinners than his parliamentary activities. He rarely spoke in the Commons, and gained his seats through money and influence, but, although a tory, he liked to maintain his independence. In 1807 he purchased Cashel through the administration, but, when unwilling to vote as they wished in 1809, he resigned. Under current patronage conventions, he was acting honourably, and was surprised when radicals pressed for an inquiry into governmental abuse of power.<br>
<br>There were further charges that he was merely a wealthy cat's-paw for the tories when he unsuccessfully contested Maldon as an anti-Catholic in 1826, and Lord Hertford's interest, Disraeli implied, helped him to win Orford (which he held from 1826 until 1830). He sat for Maldon (1830&#150;47), and in the 1840s was a peripheral (if elderly) Young Englander, figuring as the hospitable millionaire Ormsby in Disraeli's <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> (1844). His protectionist record (in 1845&#150;6) and money helped him to win Aylesbury (for which he sat 1848&#150;52), but he finally retired after two defeats at Maldon (1852, 1854).<br>
<br>Dick was dandified and stiff, old-fashioned in dress as in politics. He gave opulent Mayfair dinners, so lavishly illuminated that one guest called him &#145;Jolly Dick, the lamplighter&#146;, a nickname, Disraeli sardonically commented, completely unsuited to his habitual expression  (Disraeli, 2. 682). Despite his wealth, &#145;carrotty Quintin&#146; was unpopular and slightly ridiculous  (<span class="italic">Harriette Wilson's Memoirs</span>, 1929, 238). He never married. He died at his house at 20 Curzon Street, Mayfair, London, on 26 March 1858, leaving an estimated &pound;2 million to &pound;3 million in land, stocks, and cash.<br>
