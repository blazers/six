<span class="headword">Bernard,  John Henry</span>  (1860&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin and college head</span>, was born on 27 July 1860 at Sooree, Beerbohm, Bengal, the eldest of the three children (one brother who died in infancy and one sister) of William Frederick Bernard (1825&#150;1863), a civil engineer who worked in India for sixteen years and died there in 1863, and his wife, Martha Amelia (1833&#150;1899), eldest daughter of Henry Humphrys, woollen merchant, of Dublin.<br>
<br>On his father's death, when Bernard was still just two years of age, his mother returned to Ireland with the children, and settled in Bray, co. Wicklow, where Bernard attended school for the first time at the small local Bray College, then for a few months at St John's College, Newport, co. Tipperary, before in 1875, only just over fifteen, entering Trinity College, Dublin. He graduated in 1880, with a first in both mathematics and philosophy, and won a fellowship in 1884. Although he won the fellowship in mathematics, his real interest was in theology and philosophy and he took holy orders in 1886; two years later he was appointed to Archbishop King's lecturership, the second post in the divinity school of Trinity College.<br>
<br>After failing as part of a group seeking reforms to the management of the college, Bernard moved away from college politics and resolved to devote his energies to the duties of his lecturership (which was converted into a professorship in 1906) and to literary activities. Under the influence of Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, his output was prodigious and wide-ranging. Between 1889 and 1918 he published well over a dozen books, on biblical scholarship, theology, Kantian philosophy, and the writings of Jonathan Swift. He proved to be an excellent and influential teacher as well. On 29 July 1885 Bernard married his cousin Maud Nannie, second daughter of Robert Bernard MD RN. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Judged by Irish standards Bernard ranked as a high-churchman, and was attacked for his views by others within the general synod. In 1897 he was appointed treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1902 he accepted the deanery of St Patrick's. He took advantage of his position to invite visits from leading men in the Church of England. Unity and close relations between the two churches he always strove for. He had many friendships among prominent English churchmen, and he frequently preached at Westminster Abbey and was select preacher at Oxford and at Cambridge.<br>
<br>In his double capacity at St Patrick's and in Trinity College Bernard's influence reached its maximum. But he was &#145;clearly marked out for the episcopate by intellectual gifts and administrative abilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Aug 1927, 13), and in 1911 he accepted the see of Ossory, resigning his professorship, and severing for a time his connection with Trinity College.<br>
<br>In 1915 Bernard was elected archbishop of Dublin by the bench of bishops of the Church of Ireland. He was one of the two representatives of the Church of Ireland at the convention called by the British government following the nationalist Easter rising of 1916, to consider a new constitution for Ireland. Bernard supported the recommendations of the majority of the convention on a scheme for self-government and was chosen, along with Viscount Midleton, to speak for the southern unionists on this in private negotiations with Lloyd George. When conscription was extended to Ireland in March 1917 and opposed by nationalists and the Roman Catholic church, Bernard sent out an urgent appeal hoping &#145;that &#147;compulsory service&#148; would be cheerfully accepted&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Aug 1927, 13).<br>
<br>In 1919 the provostship of Trinity College was offered to Bernard, and it seemed that this would give perfect scope to his administrative abilities. But the new political arrangements made for a difficult time for the college for a number of years, and Bernard required all his skills to maintain its stability.<br>
<br>Bernard's writings covered a wide range of subjects. Philosophy first engaged his attention, and he collaborated with Mahaffy in the second edition of Mahaffy's book <span class="italic">Kant's Critical Philosophy for English Readers</span> (1889), contributing a commentary on the <span class="italic">Dialectic of the Pure Reason</span>, which had been left unnoticed in the first edition; and in 1892 he published independently the first English translation of the <span class="italic">Kritik of the Judgment</span>. But he soon abandoned metaphysics for scholarship, although his four volumes of sermons often show evidence of his philosophical training. Between 1890 and 1894 he edited and translated for the Palestine Pilgrims' Texts Society a number of itineraries of the Holy Land, from the originals by Eusebius and several early travellers. He made an important contribution to Irish liturgiology in an edition of the <span class="italic">Liber hymnorum</span>, published in collaboration with Robert Atkinson for the Henry Bradshaw Society (1898). Among several notable papers of Irish interest which appeared in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Royal Irish Academy was one on the <span class="italic">Domnach airgid</span>, a Latin&#150;Irish manuscript of the gospels, and another on the copy of <span class="roman">St John's gospel</span> in the Stowe missal (1893). His contributions to biblical scholarship included commentaries on the pastoral epistles (1899) and on <span class="roman">2 Corinthians</span> (1903), and two posthumously published volumes in the <span class="italic">International Critical Commentaries</span> on the gospel according to <span class="roman">St John</span> (1928). Like all his writings, these contained sound scholarship, terseness and lucidity of statement, well-balanced judgement, and a decidedly conservative point of view.<br>
<br>Bernard received the honorary degree of DCL of Oxford University (1920) and of Durham University (1905), and the honorary DD degree of Aberdeen University (1906). He was an honorary fellow of Queen's College, Oxford (1919), and of the Royal College of Physicians, Ireland (1921), a privy councillor of Ireland (1919), president of the Royal Irish Academy (1916&#150;21), and warden of Alexandra College, Dublin (1905&#150;11). Bernard died at the provost's house, Trinity College, Dublin, from heart failure, on 29 August 1927 and was buried in the old churchyard of St Patrick's Cathedral on 1 September.<br>
