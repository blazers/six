<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheppard, Sir  Fleetwood</span>  (1634&#150;1698), <span class="occ">courtier and poet</span>, born on 1 January 1634 and baptized on 20 January at Great Rollright, near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, was the second son of William Sheppard, esquire, of Great Rollright, and Maria (or Mary) Dormer, daughter of Sir Fleetwood Dormer of Grange, Buckinghamshire. His father (the son of William Sheppard and Dorothy Osborne, sister of Sir John Osborne, remembrancer of the exchequer) was in 1644 &#145;slain by one of the king's soldiers&#146;, as the parish register has it. He was buried at Great Rollright on 2 October 1644, leaving his wife with seven children. She died in January 1647.<br>
<br>Fleetwood Sheppard matriculated at Oxford on 19 November 1650, and entered as a commoner at Magdalen Hall, but soon after migrated to Christ Church, where he was nominated to a studentship (fellowship), probably through the interest of the Carnarvon family, to whom he was doubly related: his mother's brother, Peter Dormer, married his father's sister, Ann Sheppard, on 17 May 1637.<br>
<br>Sheppard graduated BA on 10 May 1654, MA on 11 June 1657, and entered as a student at Gray's Inn on 14 October 1657, but seems not to have stood for the bar. At Christ Church Sheppard delivered a Latin oration in the divinity school on 27 July 1663 at the funeral of William Creed, regius professor of divinity. He was also said to be able to &#145;read Hebrew without the pricks&#146;  (Rymer, 142). In 1664, when all members of the chapter were required to be in full orders, the king instructed Henry Aldrich, dean of Christ Church, that &#145;Fleetwood Shepherd M.A. &hellip; has studied civil law, and is therefore not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664&#150;5</i>, 111).<h2>
<a name="Courtier"></a>Courtier</h2>&#145;After his majesty's restoration&#146;, Wood says, Sheppard &#145;retir'd to London, hang'd on the court, became a debauchee and atheist, a grand companion with Charles lord Buckhurst, afterwards earl of Dorset, Henry Savile, and others&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.627). Offsetting Wood's dyspeptic account there is a letter of recommendation from Ralph Montagu, ambassador to France, to secretary Sir Henry Bennet written before 25 April 1669:<blockquote>He is as witty and ingenious [a] man as ever I met with, and may be made very good use of [in the foreign service]. He is an excellent scholar; he left the University because he was too honest to be a divine. He is very modest, and so not likely to be troublesome to your Lordship. (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 1.421)</blockquote>&#145;The others&#146; at court to whom Buckhurst introduced Sheppard were his sometime mistress, Nell Gwyn,<blockquote>Henry Killigrew &hellip; gro[o]me of the bed-chamber, Henry Savile sometime one of the gro[o]mes of the duke of York's bed-chamber, Hen. Guy cupbearer to his majesty, Baptist May keeper of the privy purse &hellip; Joh. Wilmot earl of Rochester, Joh. [Sheffield] earl of Mulgrave &amp;c. All which were the king's companions at most suppers in the week, an[no] 1676, [16]77.</blockquote>Sheppard soon &#145;became one of [the king's] companions in private to make him merry&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.627).<br>
<br>When Nell Gwyn's first child by the king, Charles Beauclerk, later duke of St Albans, was born in May 1670, Sheppard is said to have been appointed &#145;steward&#146; of her household, managing her financial affairs and eventually tutoring her son. This claim, however, is not confirmed by other sources. What is certain is that on 16 October 1678 &#145;Nell Gwyn with Fleetw. Shepard were entertained by certain scholars at Cambridge &hellip; and had verses presented to her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.420).<br>
<br>Sheppard's familiarity with Charles II inevitably exposed him to such scurrilities as &#145;the best of all <i>Pimps</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 5.403) and &#145;less wit than clown&#146;  (Wilson, 94). But his rewards were modest: grants of &pound;200 from the privy purse in 1680 and 1681.<br>
<br>Buckhurst, who succeeded as sixth earl of Dorset in December 1677, proved to be a more rewarding and more durable friend. In 1675&#150;7 he would go to Great Rollright when Sheppard visited his brother, William Sheppard, who had inherited the estate. In September 1680 they travelled to Paris together to visit Henry Savile, now English ambassador  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 431). Sheppard's imaginative neighbour at Great Rollright, Ralph Sheldon of Weston, assured Anthony Wood that they entertained themselves &#145;talking blasphemy and atheisme, drinking, and perhaps that which is worse&#146;. Wood also heard that &#145;Sheppard was either hanged or broke upon the wheele at Parys for some roguery that he had committed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 2.359, 360). In earlier mishaps Sheppard was<blockquote>overturned in a coach att Matt Clifford's funerall and broake his head, and a little before was runn with a sword under the eye endeavouring to part [Henry] Bu[lkele]y [master of the King's household] and [George] Etheridge [the dramatist] squabbling in a Taverne. (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 2.160)</blockquote>In the next reign, since James II could not conceal his dislike of him, Sheppard retired to Copt Hall, Dorset's estate in Epping Forest, north of London. After the revolution, however, Sheppard was returned to favour, or &#145;dwindled to flatter Dutchmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 5.534), as one disgruntled tory put it. Promptly in 1689 William appointed Dorset chamberlain of the royal household (and a privy councillor <i>ex officio</i>), a post commanding vast patronage that Dorset voraciously exploited. Sheppard seems to have served Dorset much in the way that Jonathan Swift served Robert Harley, earl of Oxford&#151;as dispenser of patronage. At least this is what Matthew Prior assumed when he asked Sheppard in 1689 to get him &#145;some little Place&#146;, like the laureateship, for which he had no pretensions whatever  (<span class="italic">Literary Works of Matthew Prior</span>, 1.84). Dorset, however, was alleged to have &#145;Bequeath[ed] the Selling of Places to Shepherd&#146;  (BL, MS Harleian 7315, fol. 166<i>v</i>). Jonathan Swift said that &#145;Fleet. Shepherd &hellip; would often sell Places that were never in Being, and dispose of others &hellip; before they were vacant&#146;  (J. Swift, <span class="italic">A New Way of Selling Places at Court</span>, 1712, 5). One John Bearcroft, serjeant-at-arms to Charles II but now unemployed, petitioned the House of Commons on 2 June 1689 to require &#145;<i>Fleet Sheppard</i> [and others] &hellip; [to] give an Account of the many Thousand Guineas they have unjustly got from those now put in his Majesty's Service&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 10.192). No action was taken because the sale of offices was Dorset's perquisite as lord chamberlain of the household.<br>
<br>In 1690 Dorset appointed Sheppard a gentleman usher and daily waiter to the king, with lodgings in Whitehall Palace. Sheppard proved as successful in making &#145;The Queen &hellip; very merrey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.137) as he had her uncle, Charles II. Indeed, it was not thought too much to say that he &#145;made himself and the World very merry&#146;  (Oldmixon, 72). On 26 April 1694 he was knighted and succeeded Sir Thomas Duppa as gentleman usher of the black rod, with responsibilities in the royal household, in the House of Lords, and in the Order of the Garter. In June 1696 Sheppard received his last post, keeper of his majesty's Little Park of Windsor. Prior's puzzling remark in a letter to Dorset of 12/22 June 1695, &#145;Sir Fleetwood &hellip; <i>went over to the other side</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 3.80), may be explained by the first of Tom Brown's <span class="italic">Letters from the Dead to the Living</span>, &#145;A letter of news from Mr. <i>Joseph Haines</i>, of merry memory, to his friends at Will's Coffee House in <i>Covent Garden</i>&#146;: &#145;Tony Lee [Anthony Leigh, another stage comedian] turn'd Presbyterian Parson upon his coming to these quarters &hellip; my Lord Warwick [a notorious Puritan] and Sir Fleetwood are his constant hearers&#146;  (Brown, 12).<br>
<br>In October 1696, after the House of Commons voted &#145;a Supply to be granted his Majesty, for carrying on the War against <i>France</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.568), &#145;sir Fleetwood invited all the members to the kings cellar by his majesties command, where they drank the kings health&#146;  (Luttrell, 4.130).<h2>
<a name="Poetandcritic"></a>Poet and critic</h2>Sheppard is said to have been the &#145;author of many poems&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.628), but since, like Rochester, he published none, only about fifteen have survived. These fifteen, however, spin a slender thread between the late metaphysicals and the early Augustans, between Andrew Marvell and Swift and Pope.<br>
<br>Sheppard began by translating Marvell's Latin verse into English, and ended by exchanging verse letters with Matthew Prior and subscribing to Dryden's translation of Virgil (1697). He witnessed three of the literary epiphanies of the late seventeenth century. He was there early in 1669 when Buckhurst bought from Thomas Helder's stall in Little Britain a remaindered copy of the first edition (1667) and &#145;discovered&#146; <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. In June 1675 an elaborate chronometer in the Privy Garden at Whitehall Palace was &#145;broken all to pieces (for they were of glass spheres) by the earl of Rochester, lord Buckhurst, Fleetwood Shephard, etc. coming in from their revells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.34). And although he is said to have known &#145;every tavern from Fish Street Hill to the Cockpit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 3.65), Sheppard's local was Arthur Prior's Rhenish wine house in Channel (later Cannon) Row. When Buckhurst came there looking for him, he found the proprietor's nephew, Matthew Prior, drawer and scullery boy, reading Horace at the bar and sent him back to school at Westminster under Richard Busby.<br>
<br>Sheppard's poems are satires, both social&#151;&#145;A description of a Hampton court life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 5.56), &#145;Upon an Old Affected Court Lady&#146;  (Buckingham, 182), and political&#151;&#145;Songs on the Duke of M[onmouth]&#146;  (Wilmot, 231), &#145;Epitaph on the French King&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Works of Matthew Prior</span>, 2.848) (Louis XIV was cut for an anal fistula in 1697 and declared &#145;past recovery&#146; on 18 June 1698), &#145;The true and genuine explanation of one of King James's explanations&#146; (1692)  (Oldmixon, 72).<br>
<br>Since a satire, unlike a comedy, has no predetermined shape, it may take its shape from a dazzling array of sub-genres. Sheppard adopted many of the same that Swift used later, such as: mock prophecy&#151;&#145;A prophecy, found under the foundation of Wallingford Chappel, ingraven in lead, discovered the 2nd of June 1694 and sent to the Lord Mayor by Thomas Povey to proclaime a fast immediately from four a clock to six a clock&#146; (1694)  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.326); mock petition&#151;&#145;The countess of Dorset's petition to the late Queen Mary for chocolate&#146;  (Harris, 154); mock epitaph&#151;&#145;An Epitaph on the d[uke] of G[rafton]&#146; (1690)  (<span class="italic">New Collection</span>, 272); and ballad&#151;&#145;The Ballad about the Person that was Kill'd at Newbury with Eating Custard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 5.105). Alexander Pope did not hesitate to appropriate some of Sheppard's best lines: &#145;And all in order on her Toylet Lay/Pray'r-Books and Patch Box, Sermon-Notes and Paint&#146; (Buckingham, 83; cf. <span class="italic">Twickenham Edition</span>, 2.155). Sheppard also wrote &#145;A true and full account of a late conference between the wonderful speaking head [Thomas Tenison, later archbishop of Canterbury], and Father Godwyn, as 'twas related by the head's own mouth to Dr. Frasier&#146; (<i>c</i>.1681)  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 1716, 3.121), an anti-clerical satire in the tradition of Marvell's &#145;Fleckno, an English Priest of Rome&#146;.<br>
<br>Besides his reputation as a poet, Sheppard was highly regarded as a critic. Rochester was content to have him &#145;And some few more &hellip; / Approve my sense&#146;  (Wilmot, 101). Three contemporary critics dedicated books to Sheppard: Thomas Rymer, <span class="italic">The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider'd and Examin'd by the Practice of the Ancients</span> (1678 for 1677); John Dennis, <span class="italic">Poems in Burlesque</span> (1692); and Charles Gildon, <span class="italic">Chorus poetarum</span> (1694). An anonymous writer opposing Thomas Shadwell's candidacy for the laureateship in 1690 bids &#145;Sheppard, arise! &hellip; / Thou judge of wit! Is not poor Shadwell weak?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State</span>, 5.111). And Prior, who had reservations about Sheppard's verse: &#145;too much into Romance and Improbability&#146;  (Prior, <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span>, 186), had no doubt that Sheppard was &#145;the Muses Friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Works of Matthew Prior</span>, 1.73): &#145;<i>All who write would fain please</i> Sheppard&#146;  (Dennis, sig. A4<i>r</i>).<h2>
<a name="ThedeathsofSirFleetwoodSheppard"></a>The deaths of Sir Fleetwood Sheppard</h2>Sheppard's last and best joke may have been his death, unmarried and without children, in 1698. In September 1694 Godolphin was informed that Sheppard was dead. Sir Fleetwood was able to deny this report himself, while &#145;confessing that he was afflicted with the stone for the last 12 or 14 years&#146;  (Redington, 385). In December 1697 he was again reported to be &#145;dead or dying&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1697</i>, 538), but on 4 January 1698 the report was denied: &#145;Sir Fletw. Shepherd has deceived us, and still lives&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1698</i>, 12). On 14/24 April Prior wrote to Keppel from Paris, &#145;The prints say poor Sir Fleetwood is worse, for which I am extremely sorry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 3.208). On 25 August/4 September 1698 Prior learned that his old friend &#145;(who had for some time been in effect dead) marched off yesterday morning&#146;  (ibid., 3.261). Sheppard actually died at Copt Hall on 25 August 1698, and was buried in the chancel of Great Rollright chapel on 6 September. But this was apparently yet another false alarm, for seventy years later it was discovered that &#145;There is now living, at his seat in Essex, Sir Fleetwood Sheppard &hellip; in perfect health, though at the age of 120 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, September 1768, 175).<br>
<br>Tom Brown claimed, in a mock epitaph, that Sheppard &#145;defuncti Venere et Baccho&#146; (&#145;died in the service of Bacchus and Venus&#146;; <span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.319). But Sheppard is no etiolated Rochester. He is very much his own man, famous for not answering letters, for failing to show up, for not keeping promises, and for &#145;Voluble&#146; lies  (<span class="italic">New Collection</span>, 439). But what the surviving evidence reveals is honesty: &#145;one virtue which I feare I have lost forever&#146;, he told Dorset, &#145;is humility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 2.172). And honesty is the quality that resonates in the Latin epitaph that he wrote for himself &#145;<i>in my</i> <i>Lord</i> Dorset'<i>s</i> <i>Common Prayer-Book at</i> Copt-Hall&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 600):<blockquote>
<div>O you who are sure of your salvation,<br>
</div>
<div>pray for the soul<br>
</div>
<div>of the abandoned sinner<br>
</div>
<div>Fleetwood Shepheard,<br>
</div>
<div>still among the living, and sinning wherever he find himself.<br>
</div>
<div>Of meagre faith yet of hope unabashed,<br>
</div>
<div>he wishes and awaits&#151;without having earned it&#151;a happy resurrection.<br>
</div>
<div>In the third year of the restoration of our religion and our liberty,<br>
</div>
<div>under the governance<br>
</div>
<div>of William most brave and Mary most fair.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.319, trans. M. Skulsky)</blockquote>
