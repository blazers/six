</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holles,  Denzil</span>, first Baron Holles  (1598&#150;1680), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 31 October 1598, the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13554/', "John Holles, first earl of Clare (d. 1637)")</script>, and Anne (1576&#150;1651), daughter of Sir Thomas Stanhope. His father was a substantial landowner in Nottinghamshire who also possessed important properties in London that brought in a quarter of his income at the time of Denzil's birth&#151;his total income being between &pound;5000 and &pound;6000. His mother, daughter of another prominent Nottinghamshire gentleman, had brought a significant dowry with her. Denzil's father purchased the barony of Haughton in 1616 for &pound;10,000 and the earldom of Clare in 1624 for &pound;5000, but both titles passed to Denzil's older brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13555/', "John Holles, second earl of Clare")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandmarriages"></a>Early life and marriages</h2>Denzil, like other younger sons, was educated in a way that suggests that a career in the professions was in his family's mind. Like his father he attended Christ's College, Cambridge (matriculated June 1611), but unlike him graduated BA (<i>honoris causa</i> at the time of a visit by Prince Charles in 1613) and proceeded MA in 1616 and, also like his father, attended Gray's Inn, from 1615. But a proposed grand tour was twice abandoned. And successful activity in the marriage market spared him having to work for a living: first (on 4 June 1626) he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of Sir Francis Ashley, a wealthy lawyer and king's serjeant. Dorothy was an only child and stood to bring a large fortune with her&#151;the down payment on marriage consisted of lands worth &pound;600 per annum. He married again, on 12 March 1642. His wife was Jane (<i>d</i>. 1666), wealthy widow of Sir Walter Covert, and eldest daughter of Sir John Shirley of Ifield, Sussex. Then on 16 September 1666 he married Esther (<i>d</i>. 1683), widow of Jacques Richer, seigneur de Cambrernon en Normandie; she was the severely Huguenot daughter of Gideon le Lou. Even a younger son could benefit from the marriage market, and an income of &pound;300 settled on him by his father was swollen to some &pound;4600 a year, principally as a result of choosing the right brides.<br>
<br>Holles was the angry younger son of a bitter and disappointed father. John Holles had been a gentleman pensioner under Elizabeth I but was sidelined in 1603 and despite endless attempts to draw attention to himself, not least by the extravagant purchase of peerages, he failed to get the positions at court he craved. His one big break was his appointment in 1610 as comptroller of the household of Prince Henry; no sooner had Holles settled in than the prince died and his household was dissolved. Holles attempted to tie himself to the interest of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, in the years after 1617, but he was one of too many, and his sycophancy got him nowhere, while his pro-Spanish stance soon became a liability. His godly protestantism was going out of favour, too. His letter-books show a man whose ambition was consuming and counter-productive. He became a bitter, sour old man. It rubbed off on his son.<h2>
<a name="The1620sparliamentsandthepersonalrule"></a>The 1620s parliaments and the personal rule</h2>Denzil was inconspicuous as MP for St Michael, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1624. He was returned in 1628 to Charles I's third parliament as MP for godly Dorchester where his then father-in-law was recorder. But although he had been privately expostulating to his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Wentworth about the miserable failures of the government to further the protestant cause&#151;&#145;every man knows, that since England was England, it received not so dishonourable a blow&#146; as in the failure at the Isle of R&eacute;  (<span class="italic">Earl of Strafford's Letters and Despatches</span>, 1.41)&#151;he seems to have been mute in the first session. But he found a new voice and a new resolve in the second session, speaking out against the customs farmers who had seized the goods of those merchants who had refused to pay non-parliamentary customs duties. When it became clear that the king would dissolve parliament rather than let this issue be pursued Holles was one of nine members who met privately in the Three Cranes inn in the City (but not so privately that the privy council did not get wind of it) to plan &#145;that we go not out like sheep scattered: but to testify to the world we have a care of their safety&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 20). The outcome was the infamous m&ecirc;l&eacute;e on 2 March 1629 in which Holles and Benjamin Valentine held the speaker in his chair to prevent him from rising and thus adjourning the house (Holles allegedly crying &#145;God's wounds, he would sit until they pleased to rise&#146;; Notestein and Relf, 104). He also read to the house a digest of the paper denouncing as treasonous the collection of non-parliamentary customs duties and the promotion of Arminianism. Not surprisingly the nine conspirators were arrested. There followed a long struggle for bail. The king's lawyers, stymied by the petition of right, knew that they had to show cause for the imprisonment, but feared to allege that it was for words uttered and acts committed in the parliament house, lest the judges ruled that they were protected by parliamentary privilege. They therefore delayed and tried to bypass the courts by offering bail on bonds of good behaviour (which would imply an admission of guilt). In the end (29 October 1629), there was a fudge&#151;Holles's bail was paid by his father-in-law and by his friend William Noy (whether with or without his foreknowledge and collusion is not clear). In January 1630 the attorney-general took the plunge and accused Sir John Eliot, Holles, and Valentine of conspiracy. They refused to plead on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of them (a deeply ironic pre-echo of the king's plea precisely nineteen years later), and were found guilty on a <i>nihil dicit</i> and fined&#151;in Holles's case 1000 marks (&pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.). He remained on bail, his fine unpaid, until it was cancelled by the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>Over the next decade Holles was a sullen country gentleman. He was living in a dower house close to Dorchester, and close to the hot-gospelling town minister, John White, whose <span class="italic">Commentary upon Genesis</span> (1656) was dedicated by White's son to Holles &#145;as an acknowledgment of your great friendship, and the severall Courtesies he had received from you&#146;  (sig. A2). Holles held some of the lesser offices associated with a man of his standing (commissioner for sewers in Dorset, 1636&#150;8, a captaincy in the Dorset militia, from 1636) but he was not placed on the commission of the peace. He resisted (briefly) the second writ for ship money in 1635, he chased off some saltpetremen who came to dig up the soil around his dovecote (1638), and he refused to pay coat and conduct money towards the king's campaign against the Scots in 1639. His truculence had been enhanced rather than stilled by the events of 1629&#150;30.<h2>
<a name="Memberofparliament16401642"></a>Member of parliament, 1640&#150;1642</h2>It is no surprise, therefore, to find that Holles was returned as MP for Dorchester in both the elections of 1640. Again he was a slow starter, playing little part in the Short Parliament or the early months of the Long Parliament&#151;indeed Clarendon is quite clear in his <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> that the king was planning in April 1641 to make Holles secretary of state as part of the plan for reconstructing his government with former critics. Holles's family ties caused him to take a back seat in the proceedings against Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford (indeed to work to save his life), and he backed John Pym's proposals for replacing the king's prerogative revenues with substantial parliamentary ones. But, as so often with the king, he was deterred from going the extra yard by Holles's surly puritanism. It was Holles who carried the Commons' articles of impeachment against Archbishop Laud to the Lords; it was Holles who showed most enthusiasm for a religious conformity between Scotland and England when it was proposed by the Scots commissioners in 1641 (indeed he showed himself consistently sympathetic in 1641 to all the Scots demands), and he was prominent on 9 February in supporting the London ministers' call for the abolition of episcopacy &#145;roots and branches&#146;. By summer 1641 his position was largely indistinguishable from that of Pym and he shared the latter's paranoia about popish plots and the poisoning of the king's mind by evil counsellors. But there were differences. His opposition to episcopacy clearly arose not from an absolute objection to the office but from an alarm at the refusal of the existing bishops to accept a reduction of their powers&#151;indeed his strongest speeches on religion were on measures to disbar the clergy from all manner of secular employment&#151;and, unlike Pym, he showed a precocious dismay at the spread of sectarian activity: on 5 June 1641 he demanded that the houses take steps to silence &#145;mechanical men that preached now up and down&#146; and to prevent &#145;this great disorder before it came to a higher pitch and degree&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 52). Headstrong and outspoken on religious issues, and one of those first thought of whenever a message needed to be conveyed to the Lords (he was used on seven occasions in 1641), Holles was wobbling into the camp of those unwilling to accept the king's concessions as sufficient to safeguard liberties. But he <i>was</i> wobbling: he was omitted from the powerful executive committee that managed affairs during the autumn while the king was in Scotland and parliament was adjourned.<br>
<br>When the houses reconvened Holles was present, but again his role was largely one of making terse, intemperate speeches, especially on the need to remove evil counsellors (he pressed for another round of impeachments), and on the need to remove the clergy from all secular employments. Most dramatically, when thirteen bishops were impeached Sir Simonds D'Ewes wrote that on 26 October 1641 &#145;Mr Denzil Holles &hellip; move[d] us to give a name to our impeachment of the 13 Bishops and call it treason&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Coates, 39). It is not surprising therefore that Charles (whose memory of 1629 was all too fresh, and who might have had leaked to him details of Holles's close links with the Scots over the preceding months) should exaggerate Holles's importance and intransigence, and that he should name him as one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94998', "five members")</script> of the Commons whom he sought to pluck out and arraign on charges of treason on 5 January 1642 as the arch-incendiaries in a plot against his authority. What is more he had the evidence&#151;both in their role in publishing the grand remonstrance and in their secret correspondence with the Scottish committee of the estates&#151;to make it good in law.<h2>
<a name="Warriorforpeace16421646"></a>Warrior for peace, 1642&#150;1646</h2>From that point to the outbreak of war in summer 1642 Holles had an enhanced status. He carried a number of peremptory requests from the Commons to the Lords, including a demand that the Lords join the Commons in a request to the king to appoint named persons to control the Tower of London and the militia: if they failed in their &#145;duty&#146; he said, they would put peace at risk and &#145;they must not expect this House to come to them again in this business&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 162, fol. 365<i>v</i>). In February the Commons made him deputy lieutenant of Bristol and in July he was appointed to help to organize the Dorset militia.<br>
<br>So there was never any prospect that Holles would leave Westminster for the king's headquarters. But there was also never a sign that he believed that the issues dividing the country needed to be settled by war. He was in 1642, and was to remain, committed to the view that a negotiated settlement was necessary and possible. In 1641 and 1642 twelve of his speeches were published and they reveal a consistent view: the king was a good but weak man misled by evil counsellors. He had been persuaded to subvert the rights and privileges of parliament and thereby to subvert the liberties of the people, which parliaments existed to defend and promote. Similarly, whenever he spoke of religion, he spoke of how the existing system had been discredited by a generation of bishops and their clerical cronies, and he accused them of introducing forms of worship and discipline evocative of the Roman Catholic church, thereby subverting true religion. He comes across as a strait-laced Calvinist internationalist.<br>
<br>Holles went reluctantly but unflinchingly to war against a king who was mentally ensnared by evil counsellors. He took up his responsibilities in the west, conducting a review of the Bristol militia, and then returned to London, raised a regiment of foot in the capital, and marched out with the earl of Essex. He was one of three colonels detached to attack Sherborne Castle, but was repulsed on 6 September, with a loss of more than half his men, albeit more by desertion than death. He limped back to Westminster, recruited his regiment back to strength, and rejoined the lord general in time to play an active and courageous part in the battle of Edgehill, where his men stood their ground on the left centre, while regiments on either side of his crumbled. The parliamentary commissioners singled him out for special commendation: &#145;through the valour of Colonel Holles's and the Lord General's they obtained a victory&#146;  (<span class="italic">England's Memorable Accidents</span>, 1649, 62). He soon encountered the bitterness of defeat. As the royalists made a push on London which was halted at Brentford on 11 November, Prince Rupert, launching a surprise attack through a thick morning fog, wiped out Holles's regiment, killing one third and taking two thirds captive, together with fifteen guns and eleven colours. Holles was absent, but his confidence was badly shaken. Although offered command of the army of the west, he declined. Henceforth he was committed to the essentially defensive strategy of the earl of Essex and to constantly seeking a route to peace. D'Ewes recorded, on 24 November, that Holles &#145;was much cooled in his fierceness by the great slaughter made in his regiment at Brentford&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 84). He henceforth became recognized as the leader of the peace party.<br>
<br>That did not mean surrender. It meant having a clear set of principles for a settlement, but endlessly probing how to achieve them by negotiation. Whenever&#151;as in spring 1643, winter 1644&#150;5, summer 1646&#151;the king was willing to talk Holles was prominent in formulating terms and in thinking of ways of addressing issues flexibly. The principles included: the nature of parliamentary control of those who advised the king and exercised authority in his name; those who were to be punished for their &#145;malignancy&#146; and how; and the nature of the confessional state that would be established to secure the protestant interest. Thus as the negotiations on the Oxford articles ran into the sand in early March 1643, and D'Ewes feared that they would collapse, Holles &#145;very seasonably and fortunately&#146; moved that they should treat on the propositions notwithstanding. He always sought to sustain or to reopen public treaties. And he opposed everything that would throw new difficulties in the way of a settlement: thus in May 1643 he opposed the proposal that the houses should have a new great seal made (the lord keeper having carried the original away to royalist headquarters). But more controversially he was willing to enter into secret treaties, using intermediaries to test the water for revised sets of proposals that he could lay before the houses. Thus in June 1643 he was clearly apprised of, and willing to go along with, the plans of Edmund Waller to seize control of the London militia using a royal commission of array, and thereby to restore royalist control of London as a prelude to the arrest of the most senior war party leaders including three of the five members attainted with Holles by Charles in January 1642, and the launch of conciliatory peace terms. When the king shortly afterwards issued a revised list of those he would exempt from pardon Holles's name was strikingly absent. Waller's plot failed, but when, in early August, Holles was teller for a motion that was defeated, to present to Charles new terms drawn up by the Lords, there is evidence that the war party contemplated his summary arrest. As about one third of the remaining Lords&#151;including Holles's elder brother&#151;departed from London for Oxford or for their estates, Holles applied for and was granted a pass to go to the continent so long as he took with him no plate and no children over sixteen. This warrant was revoked shortly afterwards, but it is a sign of the intolerable tensions within the Commons.<br>
<br>For the next twelve months Holles was much less active, much less visible, much less engaged. The groups he had led disintegrated, many deserting or fleeing abroad, or at any rate ceased attending regularly. Despite his earlier enthusiasm for Scottish involvement in the English settlement of 1641 he viewed with distaste the terms of the solemn league and covenant that brought them back into England bound by a solemn oath to impose certain conditions on the kingdoms. There are, indeed, signs that his religious views were modifying. His concern was with the purity of gospel preaching and a workable alliance of godly minister and magistrate, and he was not going to let forms of church government get in the way of peace. A straw in the wind was his surprisingly passionate defence of Daniel Featley, a &#145;reformed episcopate&#146; man and ally of James Ussher, whom the firebrands in the Commons wished to expel from his living in Lambeth.<br>
<br>In the whole of 1644 Holles is most visible in his support for Lord General Essex against the more hawkish generals who criticized Essex's over-cautious strategy and in the long, slow thaw in his relations with the Scots. He shared their abhorrence of sectarianism and the promotion of free worship. He shared their political objectives. He was willing to abide the determinations of the Westminster assembly, subject to their open negotiation with the king when the time for settlement came.<br>
<br>By November 1644 there was an apparent military impasse and the houses set out on a dual strategy: the reorganization of their armies that resulted in the self-denying ordinance and the creation of the New Model Army, and a new push for peace, initiated by the supporters of Essex and those back-bench MPs whose lands lay in royalist territory. Holles, with others, was sent to Oxford with the preliminary version of what became (two months later) the Uxbridge articles. The commissioners took part in formal meetings, but two or three of them, Holles foremost among them, also took part in secret exploratory talks, brokered by Sabran, the French ambassador. So much Holles was later to admit. But one of those also involved, Lord Savile, was later to allege that Holles undertook to send secret reports to the king revealing what was really happening behind the scenes at Westminster (to assist in the peace process) and this Holles always strenuously denied. Certainly someone sent such letters to the king in 1645, but those who investigated the affair at the time and those who have studied it since have failed to find the smoking gun. Holles may well have gone further in his attempts to broker a peace than he ever admitted; but he probably did not go that far.<br>
<br>These revelations paralysed the Commons throughout June and July 1646. Savile accused Holles (and Bulstrode Whitelocke) of leaking secrets to the king; they responded by accusing Savile of being the agent of a plot masterminded by Henry Vane, Oliver St John, and Lord Saye and Sele to make their own private treaty with the king. Neither set of charges could ever be proven, for Savile could produce only an unsigned letter of disputed provenance; and the obvious explanation for the conduct of Vane, St John, and Saye was that, honestly believing that the king had a secret agent reporting to him from within the committee of both kingdoms, they were indeed engaged in following up possible ways of turning some leading royalists without the king finding out about it from disloyal parliamentarians. After weeks of investigation and mutual recrimination both sides admitted defeat, but Holles thought it best to seek leave to absent himself to the country for the high summer of 1645.<br>
<br>Whatever the truth behind these murky allegations, peace was not to be procured by negotiation or treachery. And the reorganization of armies constituted a political defeat. With Essex sidelined and Independent generals in control Holles formed an uneasy alliance with the Scots (it was their evidence which discredited Savile and made his testimony against Holles worthless). Holles thus worked closely with them in the months after the end of the war to shape and proffer the Newcastle propositions. By now he had identified himself with subversion of the <i>jure divino</i> schemes for presbyterian settlement propounded by the Westminster assembly and the embracing of a &#145;lame, erastian presbytery&#146; but this was clearly not his own first choice. It represented a form he hoped and believed that both the Scots and, eventually, the king could grudgingly live with.<h2>
<a name="Leaderofcounterrevolution16461647"></a>Leader of counter-revolution, 1646&#150;1647</h2>Holles had fought and lost all the parliamentary battles of the war years; he was to win some parliamentary battles only to lose the war of the peace years. Weariness with war, economic and social ruin, and religious anarchy meant that most MPs wanted settlement. Holles emerged as the man to deliver it. He had a clear plan: to persuade the Scots to hand over Charles and to return to Scotland and disband; to promote a general demilitarization throughout Britain; and then to hold face-to-face talks with Charles and reach agreement. He had never been for a sell-out, only for talks with limited preconditions. His power base was in the committee for Irish affairs at Derby House, which was packed with his friends and allies and which took over effective control of the executive wing of government from the committee of both kingdoms.<br>
<br>Holles's plan had an inexorable logic to it. By paying the Scots to go home and to disband it became possible to argue for the large-scale disbandment of the English army (save those who would be sent to Ireland to undertake the gradual restoration of protestant hegemony there). The reduction of the English army to 6400 men, mainly drawn from regional armies rather than from the New Model, would begin the process of restoring traditional governance in England, with the general reduction of taxation and wartime bureaucracy. It would then be straightforward to enter into a personal treaty with the king leading to his restoration with enough restraints on his freedom of action to ensure long-term peace and stability. This plan cleared the first hurdle&#151;sending home the Scots&#151;but it fell at the second, persuading the New Model Army to disband. Holles simply could not raise enough money both to pay a reasonable proportion of the more than &pound;2 million in arrears owed to soldiers still in service, and to pay for the reconquest of Ireland. And when the army protested Holles personally, in Edmund Ludlow's words, &#145;drew up a resolution upon his knee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.149) and had it adopted by the Commons as what became known as the declaration of dislike. This, provocatively, challenged the right of soldiers to petition and threatened to cause any who did so to be prosecuted as disturbers of the peace. Nothing demonstrates better Holles's ability to be simultaneously resolute and reckless, courageous and crass. It set off a chain reaction with the defiance of the army, its refusal to be seen as &#145;a mere, mercenary army&#146;, and led to the organization of the general council of officers and adjutators, and in the late summer and autumn to the evolution of a full-scale programme of constitutional and social reform in the form of the <span class="italic">Heads of the Proposals</span> and <span class="italic">The Case of the Armie Truly Stated</span>. As army militancy escalated over the following months Holles responded with provocation upon provocation&#151;for example by renewing the requirement that all remaining officers must have taken the covenant. He showed a lack of sympathy and understanding for the material grievances of the army&#151;their arrears, their concern for indemnity, for pensions for widows and the maimed, for future employment&#151;and he could not see why they would not disband on the same meagre terms accepted by men in the regional armies disbanded in 1646. Just like Charles I in 1640&#150;42 he alternated between sullen retractions and petulant threats of force. He attempted through the early summer months to raise a large force of troops to overbear the New Model (the London militia, the northern and western armies, thousands of reformadoes, decommissioned and disbanded men in London awaiting their pay-offs). While dozens of provincial MPs, driven on by a yearning for settlement, had backed him in the spring, they became alarmed at the prospect of confrontation between two rival armies raised by the parliament, and his majorities fell. In a final desperate gamble Holles appealed to the respectable tradesmen of London who were suffering most from the trade recession and crippling levels of taxation and asked them to support his plea for the king to be brought to London for a personal treaty. When their petition was rejected by a majority of MPs angry crowds swarmed around the Palace of Westminster, and on 26 July the speakers of both houses and some fifty-seven other commoners and seven other peers fled to the army. This was Holles's nemesis. The inevitable consequence was that the New Model marched on and occupied London, scattering the coalition of military forces that Holles had imprudently trusted and demanding the arrest and expulsion of the eleven incendiaries behind the events of 26 July. Holles hid for a few days and then applied to the speaker for a pass to go abroad. It was speedily granted. Eight of the eleven left the country, most of them settling in the Netherlands. But Holles settled in Normandy where (prudently enough) he had sent his mother, his eldest son, and &pound;2000 some months beforehand.<h2>
<a name="Exileregicideexile16471660"></a>Exile, regicide, exile, 1647&#150;1660</h2>Holles remained in Normandy for almost a year. And, like many political exiles before and since, he devoted his time to the composition of misleading accounts of his rise and fall. These were published in 1699, after his death, and with the slightly erroneous title (which he did not give them) of <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. They offer little insight into his role and are consistently more interesting in the attribution of Machiavellianism to his opponents than as a reliable account of his own actions. They do, however, confirm the central folly of his political career: that Holles &#145;seriously overestimated the extent to which Charles could ever be persuaded to compromise&#146;  (Woolrych, 6).<br>
<br>After the king attempted to overturn the judgement of the first civil war by plunging the country into a new conflict, the vote against the eleven members was revoked (3 June 1648). Holles resumed his seat on 14 August following and worked, as ever before, for a personal treaty with the king that would limit his freedom to listen to bad advice or place trust in unreliable men, and that would secure control of the church in the hands of sound Calvinist protestants. He was central to the peace process that led to the proposal&#151;which he presented to the Commons&#151;on 4 December 1648 that the king's latest response represented a satisfactory basis for a settlement. It was action by Holles that had provoked both the king's arrest of seven members on 2 March 1629, and his attempted arrest of five members on 5 January 1642. His action had provoked the expulsion of eleven members of parliament on 1 August 1647. Now he provoked the greatest purge of all&#151;Pride's Purge. On 6 December the army arrested as many as forty-five members of the Commons, and prevented as many as 186 from taking their seats. The way was cleared for the removal of Charles I by enforced abdication, by deposition, or by execution. This time Holles had really miscalculated. It would seem that he was not there to see it. He was not to be found, and his house in Covent Garden soon had troopers bivouacked in it. He had fled.<br>
<br>Holles's life throughout the interregnum is only sketchily recorded. He seems to have spent the early years wholly or mainly in Normandy, and his name recurs in royalist correspondence as a potential supporter. In March 1651, while he was at Caen, he received a royal summons and the offer of the post of secretary of state. He declined firmly. But within two months his servants were named as principals in the plot instigated by a group of London ministers to organize an uprising in London to coincide with the planned Scottish invasion (this was a plot that cost the leading presbyterian minister, Nicholas Love, his life). In March 1654 Lord Protector Cromwell offered an amnesty to presbyterian exiles like Holles and a free pass home, and Holles gratefully accepted. He retired to his estate in Dorset and kept himself to himself until the eve of the Restoration.<h2>
<a name="TheRestoration16601663"></a>The Restoration, 1660&#150;1663</h2>As soon as General Monck permitted the return of men secluded at Pride's Purge to rejoin the restored Rump Parliament, Holles took his seat and within two days, on 23 February 1660, he was appointed to the council of state. When elections to the Convention were held in April he was again returned as MP for Dorchester and he was one of those who dragged Sir Edward Turner to the speaker's chair, for once a playful act. He worked hard to put the clock back to December 1648 and to admit Charles II on the terms accepted by Charles I on the eve of the purge. But the yearning for settlement upon the king's good-natured promise to leave all to parliament (since most, even of the old, parliamentarians believed that the problem of the 1640s had been a problem with Charles I, not a problem with monarchy, this is not surprising) meant that Holles was once more outvoted. The decision to send him to take the unconditional offer of Restoration to the king was intended to get him out of the way at a delicate moment&#151;one cavalier told Edward Hyde that he had voted for &#145;the old ones&#146; including Holles to be made the messengers since &#145;they would not be a trouble at home and might be sweetened by his Majesty's most excellent temper&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 191). It worked all too well. Holles found sweetness too, and for once accepted defeat with a good grace. His reward for his mission and for a well-turned speech was a place on the privy council, although further reward, in the form of a peerage as Baron Holles, came from the dregs of the Restoration cornucopia in June 1661.<br>
<br>Holles's role in the Restoration settlement was predictably erratic. He supported the principle of the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span>, but was vindictive in his role on the high court trying the regicides. He was a key figure in the shaping of the Worcester House declaration of October 1660, which sought to re-establish bishops not as diocesan autocrats but as chairs of diocesan boards of governors and which re-established the old <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> but with freedom for individuals to dissent from the &#145;noxious ceremonies&#146; that had troubled so many pre-war puritans. From early on he showed great sensitivity to the privileges of the two houses and to the full restoration of parliamentary procedures. He was precocious in supporting the restoration of the judicial powers of the houses, and especially the appellate jurisdiction of the Lords.<h2>
<a name="Diplomatandlastyears"></a>Diplomat and last years</h2>From 1662 to 1665 Holles was sent to Paris as Charles's ambassador. There his obsession with protocol and his determination to be accorded an exaggerated status as representative of the imperial crown of Britain caused irritated amusement to Charles II and cold fury in the French. Holles's comment that &#145;ceremony is substance, and who carries it in that will carry it in the essentials&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/119, fol. 110) was simply absurd in view of the calculated informality of Charles's own court and the king's own style. It rendered his embassy useless to the king; and all important negotiations with Louis XIV were conducted either via the French king's representative at St James, or via extraordinary ambassadors sent to Paris. In 1666&#150;7 Holles was employed to negotiate a peace settlement with the Dutch at the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Although much criticized at the time and since, this exercise in damage limitation was actually quite well managed in its outcome, if not in its &#145;too punctilious manner&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 207).<br>
<br>The last decade or so of Holles's life saw the general conservative drift of his life continue. He had been an angry young man. He turned into a rather vain and querulous old man, complaining about the younger generation, forgetful of the fierce passions of his own youth. He became a respectable supporter of the established church, with a strong preference for a good sermon and an unfussy liturgy, ready to dismiss a chaplain for a sexual lapse, but increasingly intolerant of those who opted out for the sake of conscience. Those he patronized in later life included Henry Compton, who was to become bishop of London, and Gilbert Burnet, fashionable preacher and polemicist.<br>
<br>Holles's house in Covent Garden became (from early 1674) an early meeting place of those who were to become the leaders of the party that sought to place limitations on the power of the crown, including the exclusion of the Roman Catholic James, duke of York, from the succession. Thus he supported the first <span class="roman">Test Act</span> that drove hundreds of Catholics from office, but opposed Danby's attempt to bind protestants to uphold the existing structures in church and state. He wrote passionately in favour of the jurisdiction of the House of Lords during the impasse arising from the case of Shirley <i>v</i>. Fagg (1675) and he allowed his proxy to be used in an attempt to get a majority in favour of a parliamentary petition asking for a dissolution. In 1676 he was dropped from the privy council. He was sufficiently important for Charles to reinstate him when he was trying to curry favour at the height of the furore instigated by the Popish Plot revelations in 1679, but by then his shrill and querulous speeches were of little value to Charles's more potent opponents, especially as he, unlike Shaftesbury, was tempted to take up the king's offer of a bill to place limitations upon the power of a popish successor. His biographer claims that &#145;in the last years of his life Holles was a man out of his time&#146;  (Crawford, <span class="italic">Holles</span>, 218) and this seems an appropriate downbeat assessment. His piety was that of the pre-war aristocratic puritan, his politics were locked into the missed opportunities of the 1640s, his sense of personal honour and refined manners made him a fuddy-duddy on the fringes of the court of Charles II. Even his will, with its fussy traditionalist proclamation of his Calvinist reliance upon the &#145;merits and mediation of the Lord Christ my God and my Redeemer&#146;  (ibid., 210&#150;11), is indicative of a man out of his time. Holles died on 17 February 1680 and was buried on 21 February in Westminster Abbey. A monument to him was erected in St Peter's, Dorchester, in 1699. His only surviving son, Francis, was from his first marriage and duly inherited the title. Holles's third wife, Esther, survived him by three years, seemingly having lived out her days in France. Denzil Holles was successful in almost everything he privately undertook, and unsuccessful in almost everything he publicly undertook. In particular, his passionate parliamentarianism was constantly counter-productive.<br>
