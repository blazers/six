<span class="headword">Cox,  Leslie Reginald</span>  (1897&#150;1965), <span class="occ">palaeontologist and malacologist</span>, was born on 22 November 1897 in Islington, north London, the son of Walter Cox, and his wife, Jessie Lucy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Witte). Educated at South Harringay county school, he won a foundation scholarship to Owen's School, Islington, in 1909. In 1916 he won an open scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, but war service delayed his entry to the university. He joined the Royal Naval Air Service, experimental section, and worked on smokescreens and flame-throwers. In April 1918 he took part and was wounded in the raid to block the German submarine base at Zeebrugge. In 1919 he finally went to Cambridge to read for part one of the natural science tripos, making geology his main subject. He attained a double first (1920 and 1921), and took his MA in 1926. (He obtained his ScD in 1937.)<br>
<br>Cox's 1920 reputation as a promising member of the university jazz band may have led him to attend the art student's dances at South Kensington, at which he met his wife, Hilda Cecilia Lewis, associate of the Royal College of Arts, daughter of the Revd William John Lewis of Mountsorrel, Leicestershire: they were married in September 1925. Both their son and their daughter eventually took degrees in geology at Cambridge.<br>
<br>As a child Cox spent his holidays with grandparents at Charmouth, Dorset, where fossil collecting became a hobby. While at Cambridge he applied for a vacancy in the department of geology at the British Museum (Natural History) and was appointed an assistant keeper (second class) in 1922, becoming responsible for fossil Mollusca (apart from the Ammonoidea). He engaged in research on post-Palaeozoic Mollusca, and his scientific contribution was such that it was thought to be too valuable for his promotion to an administrative position. However, in 1951 he was given a special merit promotion to senior principal scientific officer, following his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1950. In 1961 Cox surprisingly accepted the post of deputy keeper in the department of palaeontology, adding its responsibilities to the many he had already undertaken.<br>
<br>Many of Cox's early papers consisted of faunal descriptions of material collected by field geologists during exploration throughout the world. These enabled him to gain a wide understanding of the diverse morphology of the Mollusca and their distribution through time. He augmented this with examination of major collections in institutions and with field work in Britain and occasionally in Europe. Methodically he compiled a unique card-index system to the literature, together with a thematic reprint collection, both of which formed a reliable basis for his wide research and subsequent authoritative publications.<br>
<br>A cursory analysis of Cox's publications (more than 160) indicates that Mesozoic faunas (52), particularly those of the Jurassic (40), were his main interest and that among the Mollusca this was directed to the Bivalvia (69). His involvement with colonial geology is revealed by those on African (27) and Indian (10) faunas. Although Cox's systematic description of British (28) and foreign faunas was important, his career was punctuated by more significant contributions. His work on the evolutionary history of the rudists, an aberrant group of bivalves (1933), was the first of several major reviews of molluscan subjects that either summarized previous work, or stimulated research: for example, the <span class="italic">Thoughts on Classification</span> of the two classes (both 1960); <span class="italic">Progress in Fossil Malacology</span> (1943); and <span class="italic">British Palaeontology: a Retrospect and Survey</span> (1957). Cox's collaboration (1948&#150;50) with William Joscelyn Arkell to revise John Morris and John Lycett's monograph, <span class="italic">Great Oolite Mollusca</span>, was equally important, while his monograph on <span class="italic">British Cretaceous Pleurotomariidae</span> (1960) revealed the value of this neglected field. An interest in past literature and its relevance to nomenclature led to his authoritative work on William Smith (1930, 1942, 1948) and a sequence of papers in preparation for his <span class="italic">Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology</span> contributions (1960, 1969), together with papers on several early descriptive works by writers such as Richard Pulteney (1940) and G&eacute;rard-Paul Deshayes (1942).<br>
<br>Cox's thoroughness when dealing with any subject was typified by the records he made of every published molluscan classification, in order to establish the usage and priority of supra-generic names. Although he was not trained as a zoologist, his methodology and acumen enabled Cox to write extremely useful biological reviews of all the invertebrate classes he was involved with. He was astute enough to recognize molluscan body organs and structures on the rare occasions that these were preserved in fossil specimens (1960), or to describe the discovery of a bivalved gastropod (1960).<br>
<br>As one of the world's authorities on Mollusca, Cox devoted the last decade of his career to contributions to the <span class="italic">Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology</span>. The magnitude of these contributions to the gastropod and bivalve parts of this work was emphasized when the editors, R. C. Moore and N. D. Newell, dedicated the <span class="italic">Bivalvia</span> volumes to him. Cox's continued efforts in persuading other researchers to contribute, and then giving them generous assistance, were vital to that enterprise. But his own authoritative and comprehensive introductions to both sections have to be recognized as the most valuable outcome of his devotion to Mollusca.<br>
<br>Cox was acknowledged to be essentially a quiet and modest man, who dealt with everything in a calm manner and was never known to become irate. He kept his scientific and private lives separate. At Cambridge he had enjoyed rowing and retained this sporting link by attending Henley Regatta whenever possible. He regularly cycled into the museum from Hendon, a dangerous journey in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Through his career Cox became involved with several scientific societies. He joined the Geological Society in 1922, was awarded the Murchison fund in 1929, the Lyell medal in 1956; he served twice on its council (1940&#150;44, 1950&#150;55), and was three times appointed vice-president (1952&#150;4, 1957&#150;61, 1962&#150;5). From 1925 he was treasurer of the Malacological Society of London. He served as treasurer until 1951 (running the society throughout the Second World War), and was president in 1957&#150;60. As a member of the Geologists' Association, he was made a vice-president in 1953 and became president in 1954&#150;5. Inevitably he was one of the founder members of the Palaeontological Association, served as vice-president between 1958 and 1960, and was president at the time of his death. Cox was appointed OBE in 1958. He died suddenly at his home 30 Haslemere Avenue, Hendon, on 5 August 1965. His wife and two children survived him. His geological colleagues acknowledged the irreplaceable loss of his guidance, wisdom, balanced judgement, and quiet humour.<br>
