<span class="headword">Ganley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Blumfield]</span>,  Caroline Selina</span>  (1879&#150;1966), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and politician</span>, was born on 16 September 1879 at 33 Admiralty Street, East Stonehouse, Plymouth, the daughter of James Blumfield and his wife, Selina Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Norgrove). Her father was a bombardier at the time of her birth, and later a tailor. She attended Plymouth church and national schools, and Ottershaw School, Chertsey. On 24 July 1901 she married James William Henry Ganley, a tailor's cutter; the couple lived in Westminster before settling in Battersea, and raised two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Mrs Ganley became active in left-wing politics in opposition to the South African War, and in response to the poor social conditions of the working-class communities in which she lived. She joined the Social Democratic Federation in 1906, campaigned for the suffrage, and was instrumental in setting up a socialist women's circle in Battersea and developing it into a branch of the Women's Labour League (later the Labour Party women's sections). In 1914 she was involved in the British committee of the International Congress, anti-war suffragists who detached themselves from the more patriotic National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies to work with European women for peace.<br>
<br>After the war Mrs Ganley's politics gradually became more moderate and geared to reformism but she was no less energetic. Having campaigned for citizenship rights, she made every effort to ensure that they were put to good use. She joined the co-operative and Labour parties, and in November 1919 won a seat on Battersea borough council; she chaired the health committee, and it was mainly through her efforts that a well-equipped maternity home was opened in Battersea in 1921. In 1920 she became one of the first women magistrates in London, and for twenty years sat in juvenile courts. She also served as a London county councillor and as a member of the London county education committee.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Mrs Ganley set her sights on Westminster, seeking nomination as a Co-operative Party candidate. In 1935 she stood unsuccessfully for Paddington North but in 1945 she was elected Co-operative-Labour MP for Battersea South, delivering a maiden speech on the subject of national health care. In 1950 she held the seat with a margin of 368, and the next year her golden wedding anniversary was marked at Westminster when her female colleagues made her a presentation. In the 1951 general election she was defeated. Mrs Ganley was appointed CBE in 1953, and in the same year was re-elected to Battersea borough council where she continued to serve until 1965.<br>
<br>An outstanding figure in the consumers' co-operative movement, Mrs Ganley was an elected director of the West London Society from 1918, and after its merger with the London Society in 1921, of the London Co-operative Society, which position she retained until 1946. In 1942 she became the first woman president of the London Co-operative Society, the largest retail society in the world with 792,000 members in that year. In the early 1940s she appeared as the presenter in an educational film about its work.<br>
<br>Mrs Ganley was also prominent in the labour and co-operative women's movements. She sat on, and chaired, the standing joint committee of industrial women's organizations, and chaired the national conference of Labour women. She belonged to the Lavender Hill branch of the Women's Co-operative Guild and held a number of official positions in the guild's national committee structure including a place on the south-eastern sectional council. She was an experienced and respected guildswoman, knowledgeable on such diverse subjects as tariffs and the consumer, married women's nationality rights, and the supply of milk to schoolchildren. Although she avoided the politically sensitive issue of birth control, and was in agreement with Labour's opposition to family allowances between the wars, the care of maternity remained one of her chief concerns; in a speech at the 1928 national guild congress, for example, she urged that more co-operative women should get elected onto local authorities in order to promote measures to combat the high maternal mortality rates. In June 1943 she was honoured by the guild as one of the speakers at its diamond jubilee demonstration at the Royal Albert Hall.<br>
<br>Mrs Ganley died in London at the Bolingbroke Hospital, Battersea, on 31 August 1966, aged eighty-six. Her husband, who predeceased her, had worked for the co-operative movement prior to his retirement.<br>
