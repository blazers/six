<span class="headword">Day,  Joseph Mary</span>  (1855&#150;1946), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born at 14 Albert Terrace, Bayswater, London, on 27 September 1855, the fourth son of the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32756/', "Sir John Charles Frederic Sigismund Day (1826&#150;1908)")</script> and his first wife, Henrietta Rosa Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown (1824&#150;1893). Day attended Beaumont College, a Catholic school at Windsor, from 1868 to 1873 and then the new Crystal Palace School of Practical Engineering from 1873 to 1874. He was apprenticed at the engineering works of Stothert and Pitt in Bath from 1874 to 1877.<br>
<br>In 1878 Day set up as iron-founder and engineering manufacturer in Bath, making leather-dressing and concrete-making machines (both patented by Day and his then partner, J. W. Lampard) and cranes. Day's firm was clearly then parasitic on the company to which he had been apprenticed, which had a worldwide reputation for such machinery. On 10 May 1879, at Midford Castle near Bath, Day married Margaret Anne (1853&#150;1933), eldest daughter of James John Parfitt of Bruton. They had nine surviving children, at least two of whom were involved with their father's engineering work.<br>
<br>In the 1880s Day became intensely active as an entrepreneur in Bath, in improving that city's water supply, and in devising bread- and ice-making machinery. In April 1891 he applied for his first two-stroke internal combustion engine patent, granted in 1892. The constant litigation in Britain over the validity of the patent for a four-stroke engine, held by the German Dr Nikolaus Otto, had encouraged Day to seek an alternative design. He was thus led to try to simplify existing engine designs, probably drawing on his previous manufacture of valveless air-compressors. His Day engine (as it was soon known) used an enclosed crankcase as a pumping chamber, with two ports controlled by the piston to help charge the cycle. Day could see the possibility of marketing the engine as a portable electricity generator, but his attempts to develop the engine by raising &pound;60,000 on the stock market failed in July 1892. Later that year an employee at Day's Bath works, F. W. C. Cock (1863&#150;1944), suggested another modification of the engine with a third piston-controlled port, which was patented on 15 October 1892. This allowed the cycle to be controlled without the need for valves and with only three moving parts: piston, rod, and crank. The engine could be run in whichever direction it was started. This ultimate simplification resulted in an internal combustion engine which became the ancestor of all later lightweight, high-speed, high-revving, portable two-stroke engines.<br>
<br>However, any future which might have awaited these inventions had been sabotaged by the legal battles in which Day had become embroiled as a result of his entrepreneurial activities. New legislation to regulate joint-stock companies had encouraged both crusading journalists and predatory lawyers. Day became involved in a flurry of lawsuits, including libel actions, from December 1890, and even though he won all these actions (no doubt helped by his father's connections) the damage to his engineering activities was done. On a visit to the United States in 1894 while trying to sell his engine patents, the British secretary of state even issued instructions for Day's extradition from the USA.<br>
<br>Day and his then partner were declared bankrupt in September 1893 and their manufacturing activities in Bath came to a sudden end. Their works and stock were auctioned in May 1894 and manufacture of Day engines effectively ceased in England until 1905. Engine making passed, via licence deals, to the USA, where an enormous number of engines were made, both legally and illegally, largely to power motor-boats, since the power characteristics of the Day engine proved ideal on water. In 1906 Day discharged his bankruptcy and re-established his engine making, first at Barking in Essex and then beside the Thames at Putney. His business was successful and he supplied motor-boat engines and, during the First World War, portable pumps for dewatering trenches.<br>
<br>This last work brought Day into contact with members of the Ministry of Munitions who were concerned as to how Britain was to maintain its navy in the new era of oil-fuelled warships. Two camps developed, one considering that reserves of overseas oil should be sought, such as those newly discovered in the Middle East. The other, to which Day unfortunately allied himself, supported the uninformed, and ultimately criminal, activities of Dr William Forbes-Leslie (1865&#150;1944), who claimed the answer lay in retorting oil from Jurassic oil-shales exposed in Norfolk and elsewhere in England. Day joined the board of English Oilfields Ltd but was forced to resign in 1923 when it became clear that there was no oil in these shales. Day now sank into the oblivion which surrounded him at his death, at 1 St George's Road, St Margaret's-on-Thames, Middlesex, on Christmas day 1946, aged ninety-one. He was buried on new year's day at Teddington cemetery. His career provides a fine example of the complexities facing the inventor and entrepreneur.<br>
