<span class="headword">Bankes, Sir  John</span>  (1589&#150;1644), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Bankes, a merchant of Keswick, Cumberland, and his wife, Jane Malton. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, in February 1605. Having left without a degree, he began his legal studies at Gray's Inn in 1607. According to Nicholas Fuller, following his call to the bar in 1614 Bankes &#145;for some years &hellip; solicited suits for others&#146;, which suggests that he was more involved in the conduct of litigation, in which he obtained &#145;great practical experience&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.344), than with arguing technical points of law. Whatever the truth of this, it is likely that his early career centred on the north of England; from at least 1619, and throughout the 1620s, his professional opinion was frequently sought by Lord William Howard of Naworth.<br>
<br>Bankes was returned to parliament as a member for Wootton Basset in 1624, and in 1626 and 1628 he sat for Morpeth, almost certainly thanks to the influence of Lord Howard, whom Bankes had advised in his recent dispute with the town over the exercise of his seigneurial rights there. In the 1626 session, moreover, Bankes began to make his name as a parliamentarian, speaking regularly in debates that were also participated in by other notable lawyers such as William Noy, John Selden, and Edward Littleton. In 1628 he chaired two important committees of the house: that considering the king's claim to be entitled to take tonnage and poundage, and that dealing with the grievances of parliament. Bankes argued that the liberty of the subject should be protected by law from arrest by the king without cause being shown, and he was critical of the recent imposition by the crown of martial law and the billeting of soldiers on the country. Making the point on 16th April 1628 that &#145;the King's supply and the fundamental liberties go together&#146;  (Johnson, 2.481), he thought that recent royal commissions introducing martial law were contrary to the common law: subjects have their rights and the kings their prerogatives, &#145;[y]et the ocean hath banks, and common law limits prerogative&#146;  (ibid.). Explaining the illegality of billeting of soldiers, he developed a historical approach, claiming that a search of the records revealed that there was no tenurial obligation to &#145;find such soldiers&#146;  (ibid., 2.363).<br>
<br>In 1630 Bankes gave the Lent reading at Gray's Inn on the Jacobean <span class="roman">Statute of Limitations</span> (21 James I c. 26). In 1631 he became a bencher, and from that date until 1635 also acted in the important capacity of treasurer of the society. Along with several of his former parliamentary colleagues, Bankes also received royal recognition and promotion. He was knighted in June 1631 and became attorney-general to the infant prince of Wales in July. In early 1632 he was appointed to a commission for inquiring into the evasion of customs duties by smugglers. It is also likely that he was working with Noy, now attorney-general, on developing the legal case behind the crown's attempts to increase revenue by launching commissions to inquire into the bounds of the royal forests and the extent to which royal privileges within them had been evaded. When Noy died in August 1634 Bankes was evidently preferred over Littleton and Selden as his replacement as attorney-general. Although one of the earl of Strafford's correspondents described Bankes as more judicious than Ellesmere, more eloquent than Bacon, and more learned than Noy himself, the earl's opinion was that he would prove to have &#145;something of the indifferent in him, betwixt the Sow's ear and the Silken Purse&#146;  (Radcliffe, 1.294). Nevertheless, now occupying an office that was probably worth approximately &pound;10,000 p.a., Bankes made an impressive addition to his landed estate in 1635 by purchasing Corfe Castle on the Isle of Purbeck from Lady Elizabeth Hatton, the estranged widow of Sir Edward Coke.<br>
<br>Bankes appears to have been primarily an instrument rather than an initiator of royal policy that, during this period, was rapidly expanding the exploitation of the prerogative powers of the crown in order to raise money. Within weeks of his appointment he was busy searching for medieval precedents of royal levies of ship money. The extensive archive that has survived from his tenure as attorney-general shows that, in addition to commissions for enforcing the forest laws and for uncovering defective titles to land, he also drew up and was asked about the legality of letters patent, in which (in return for payment) the crown granted powers to groups of projectors that enabled them to regulate a wide range of trades, mainly in London, including coachmen, tobacco-pipe makers, glaziers and combmakers, distillers, musicians, and the brick and tile makers of Westminster. He also considered schemes for finding ways to license alehouse-keepers, brewers, and the owners of dovecotes, as well as plans to create commissions for enforcing the laws requiring the regular exercise of archery. Some observers thought that Bankes might lose his office in the wake of the outcry that followed the revelation that he had regularly permitted the illegal exportation of gold in return for a heavy fine, rather than initiating prosecutions in Star Chamber, as was prescribed in the proclamation prohibiting the practice. On this occasion, however, the king, evidently impressed by the income generated, promised his support, and there is little other evidence that Bankes himself profited directly by becoming involved in the many projects his paperwork launched.<br>
<br>As attorney-general Bankes was also responsible for initiating actions in Star Chamber in the king's name, and in this capacity he introduced the case against the religious dissidents Prynne, Bastwicke, and Burton, as well as that of Bishop John Williams. In May 1638 he examined John Lilburne for comments he uttered about the bishops while he was sitting in the pillory, and after the outbreak of war with Scotland in 1639 Bankes questioned a number of people who were reported to have made suspect political statements. In May 1638, when vigorously prosecuting the case against Thomas Harrison, a Northamptonshire vicar who had publicly called the judge Sir Richard Hutton a traitor because he had ruled against the legality of ship money, Bankes said that Harrison had cast an aspersion on his profession by claiming that all the clergymen in England thought the king had a right to command whatever he wanted; Harrison had failed to realize that the king's power was based on the law, and that the duty of judges was to determine to the best of their understanding what the law was. Bankes's own political views appear to have involved a strongly historical approach to the interpretation of the common law, combined with the belief that legally justified royal powers could be used both to profit the crown and to enforce social and economic regulation, which was arguably for the good of the Commonwealth. Commenting on a scheme for collecting a quarterage payment from all &#145;foreigners&#146; resident in London, Bankes observed that it was &#145;free from the least touch of oppression or monopoly, but agreeable to the old Roman law called <span class="italic">Lex peregrinaria</span> and the modern rules of policy and sound government&#146;  (Bankes Papers, 6/16). Returning legislation that had been approved for passage by the Irish parliament, Bankes wrote to Wentworth in March 1635 commending the bills for making &#145;Ireland to be England in point of Government&#146;  (Radcliffe, 1.387). His three-day-long address that put the king's argument before the judges in the case of ship money  (<i>R. v. Hampden</i>) in 1637 was largely historical in thrust. Citing an array of precedents, it illustrated the way in which early charters contained exceptions that allowed the king to raise money for the defence of the realm, and Bankes claimed that levies such as ship money had been collected in time of danger since before the Norman conquest. The writs themselves were based on many records, and were issued according to the laws and customs of England. He made it plain that he thought one of the reasons why kings could act in time of danger was that they had existed before parliaments. Royal power was inherent in the king's person, and in no way derived from the people, &#145;but [was] reserved unto the king when positive laws first began&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3, col. 1017). The king was the sole judge of imminent danger and how the danger was to be prevented and avoided. Furthermore, having sat in parliament himself in 1628, he argued that the petition of right never intended that any prerogative power of the king should be diminished. Confirming the &#145;antient and old liberties&#146;  (ibid., col. 1056) of the subject, the debates surrounding its passage had never touched on the issue of ship money.<br>
<br>According to Clarendon, Bankes was concerned in late 1640 about investigations by the Long Parliament into some of the grants that had passed through his hands during his time as attorney-general. Hence he was relieved when made chief justice of the court of common pleas on 29 January 1641, following Edward Littleton's elevation to the lord keepership. On joining the king at York in the spring of 1642 he was sworn of the privy council, and thereafter appeared regularly at the side of Charles I, evidently becoming a voice in favour of moderation. When the king became dissatisfied with the prevarication of Lord Keeper Littleton, he resisted giving the great seal to Bankes largely on grounds that he was no less cautious. Bankes himself claimed to have earned the king's displeasure by not speaking out firmly enough against the legality of parliament's militia ordinance. Along with other peers and councillors he signed a declaration on 15 June 1642 that the king had no intention of making war on parliament, and he evidently maintained good relations with members of the parliamentary leadership. During the spring and early summer of 1642 he was in regular correspondence with, among others, the earl of Northumberland and Lord Saye and Sele in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to nation's problems, which he acknowledged involved fears on both sides. The alternative, civil war, would lead to the misery of the people, and, possibly, threaten the involvement of foreign powers.<br>
<br>When war did break out Bankes accompanied the king to Oxford, where he received an honorary DCL degree on 20 December 1642. Peace propositions presented by the two houses to the king in February 1643, which were concerned with the maintenance of the judiciary, called for Bankes to retain his position as chief justice of common pleas in the proposed settlement, but while keeping summer assizes on the western circuit in the same year, Bankes gave a charge that denounced the earls of Essex and Manchester as traitors. In May of the same year, parliamentary forces laid the first of two sieges on Corfe Castle, which was famously defended by Sir John's wife, the former Mary Hawtrey [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1289/', "Bankes, Mary (d. 1661)")</script>], daughter of Ralph Hawtrey of Ruislip, Middlesex, whom he had married some years earlier.<br>
<br>Bankes's house in London was sequestered and sold by parliament in February 1644, and a resolution of the Commons on 22 July 1644 formally accused him of high treason. He died at Oxford on 28 December 1644 and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, where there is a monument to his memory. His will, dated 20 September 1642, provided &pound;200 in addition to &pound;30 p.a. for the establishment of a workhouse for the poor in his native Keswick. He had a large number of children, and expressed the desire that &#145;whatever professions they or any of them shall undertake, they shall labour with all diligence to attaine the perfect knowledge thereof. And then with all industry and a good conscience towards God and man, practise the same&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/642).<br>
