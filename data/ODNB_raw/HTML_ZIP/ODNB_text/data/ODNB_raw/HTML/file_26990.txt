<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tatham,  Charles Heathcote</span>  (1772&#150;1842), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, was born on 8 February 1772 in Duke Street, Westminster, the youngest of the five surviving sons of the thirteen children of Ralph Tatham (1732&#150;1779) of Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham, and Elizabeth Bloxham (1739&#150;1809), daughter of Jabez Bloxham, a wealthy wholesale hosier and property owner in Cateaton Street, Cheapside. On her marriage on 14 March 1761 Elizabeth brought her husband a considerable dowry with which, from 1772, he farmed and bred horses, unsuccessfully, at Havering Park, Havering atte Bower, Essex. He then became private secretary to Captain (later Admiral Lord) Rodney, a family friend, but died suddenly in London, of cholera, aged forty-seven, while on his way to join ship at Portsmouth.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Tatham was educated at Louth grammar school, Lincolnshire, under Revd John Emeris, where his proficiency in the classics led to persuasion by his uncle the Anglican divine <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25336/', "Dr Richard Shepherd")</script> to adopt the church as a vocation. Tatham was averse to the idea, and developed instead an interest in the fine arts, particularly drawing. On returning to London in 1788, at the age of sixteen, Tatham was unsettled; he worked briefly in a timber merchant's counting house, learned drawing under John Landseer, made drawings for his mother's uncle Mr Butler, a coach-maker who built the state coach (designed by Sir William Chambers and S. Cipriani in 1760), and learned mathematics near Fleet Street. At the instance of another relation of his mother's, John Linnell, the furniture maker and interior designer, Tatham became a clerk to Samuel Pepys Cockerell (1753&#150;1827), architect and surveyor, in Stratton Street, Piccadilly. Set to menial tasks without wages or proper accommodation, his training comprised copying leases for the Pulteney estate. Although articled initially for three years, Tatham's unbearable situation caused him to escape after one year, his flight precipitated by the humiliation of having to wait at dinner upon Warren Hastings. After returning to his mother's home at Bridge Street, Westminster, he spent a year copying the architectural orders from Sir William Chambers's <span class="italic">Treatise</span> (1759; rev. 3rd edn, 1791) and French ornament from Jean Le Pautre's <span class="italic">Oeuvres d'architecture</span> (1652). Linnell showed Tatham's drawings to Henry Holland, architect to the prince of Wales, whereupon Holland immediately took Tatham, aged almost nineteen, into his office as a trainee draughtsman. Holland was then engaged on additions and alterations to Carlton House, Pall Mall, for the prince of Wales, and to Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire, for Francis, fifth duke of Bedford. Assisting Holland's draughtsmen, including Dominique Daguerre, Jean Pierre Th&eacute;odore Tr&eacute;court, John Jagger, and David Hartley, Tatham contributed to both these commissions. In 1791&#150;4, for Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Holland rebuilt the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where Tatham designed and drew at large all the ornamental decorations for the royal boxes and the proscenium, his cartoons being pricked off and painted in fresco by Charles Catton the younger.<h2>
<a name="VisittoItaly"></a>Visit to Italy</h2>The declaration of war by France on 1 February 1793 made the exchange of ideas and the supply of French furnishings, so admired by the prince of Wales, increasingly difficult to organize. Despite Tatham's growing value in his office, Holland encouraged his resolve to go to Italy, to their mutual benefit. Knowing his master's requirements and to mitigate the indefinite loss of French sources, Tatham agreed to act as Holland's direct agent in Rome by supplying designs, casts of antiquities, and original pieces, simultaneously advancing his architectural studies at the source of neo-classical activity and increasing his own prospects of patronage. Linnell's offer of &pound;100, later withdrawn, was replaced by &pound;100 from John Birch, surgeon-extraordinary to George III and brother to Ann Birch, his mother's closest friend. To this Holland added an allowance of &pound;60 a year for two years.<br>
<br>Tatham sailed for Leghorn in May 1794, with the architect and painter Joseph Gandy. After travelling via Siena, they arrived in Rome in July. Through the offices of the wealthy dealer and painter in Rome, Thomas Jenkins, Tatham moved into apartments in the via Barberini, which he was to occupy throughout his two-year stay. While sketching at the Villa Borghese, he met Mario Asprucci the younger, architect to Prince Marcantonio Borghese, and Don Isodoro Vel&aacute;squez, an exhibitioner from the academy at Madrid; all three exchanged drawings and tracings and became firm friends. Tatham's letters of introduction included one from the architect Joseph Bonomi to his brother Giovanni Carlo Bonomi (1743&#150;1801), professor of theology at the college of <i>propaganda fide</i>, Rome, who almost succeeded in converting Tatham to Roman Catholicism and for whom Tatham retained a lifelong admiration. At the home near Trinit&agrave; dei Monti of the historical painter Angelica Kauffmann (aunt of Mrs Joseph Bonomi) and her husband, Antonio Zucchi, Tatham was introduced by the Venetian painter Giuseppe Bossi to the celebrated sculptor Antonio Canova, with whom he also became close friends.<br>
<br>By his elder brother John, who spent much time in Italy on account of his health, Tatham was introduced to Prince Ernest, duke of Cumberland, and Prince Augustus, duke of Sussex, thereby gaining an entr&eacute;e into the highest social circles and the latest archaeological excavations. In partnership with the Irish painter Robert Fagan and others, Prince Augustus had opened several sites outside Rome, notably at Laurentium, of which Tatham subsequently published details of finds. Visiting museums (particularly the Vatican), villas (notably Hadrian's), baths, gardens, and churches both in the capital and its vicinity, Tatham made drawings, many in the linear style which later characterized his publications. During one of his many visits to Rome, Tatham met the eccentric and wealthy collector Frederick Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry (1730&#150;1803), who intended building at his family seat, Ickworth, Suffolk, a neo-classical version of his Irish house, Ballyscullion, co. Londonderry, to house his immense art collections. Late in 1794 he invited Tatham to draw up plans and gave every indication of awarding him the commission. His designs were not accepted, however, and the building was executed by Francis Sandys to a design, unmentioned by Tatham, by Asprucci. Although the project drew attention to his name (and Holland exhorted him continually to make the most of his connections), the experience left Tatham with an ambivalence towards aristocratic patronage and architectural competitions which he was never to lose.<br>
<br>In his studies of furniture, Tatham considered the Italian bronze manufacturers superior to the French, and supervised the casting of candlesticks and other pieces, many destined for Carlton House, mostly to his own designs. He became an honorary member of the Accademia Clementina at Bologna on 29 March 1795 and a month later presented a design for a sculpture gallery, whose interiors prefigured that at Castle Howard. In 1796 he became a member of the Accademia di San Luca at Rome, where he submitted a design for a hunting-lodge.<br>
<br>By November 1795 Tatham's projected two-year visit was more than half over. Hoping to visit Athens, he set off for Naples and visited <i>en route</i> Cardinal Borgia's museum, where, as at the Vatican, he was impressed by the unrestored Egyptian antiquities. In Naples he was entertained by the British minister, Sir William Hamilton, who obtained for him a licence to view antiquities, and Lady Hamilton, whose post-prandial performance of her &#145;Attitudes&#146; sealed Tatham's opinion of her moral character, and he was introduced to the German artist Wilhelm Tischbein, Goethe's companion. Diminishing funds prevented Tatham's continuing to Athens and, having seen the Farnese <span class="italic">Hercules</span> and all the museums, including the Portici, and climbed Vesuvius, he returned, in January 1796, to Rome.<br>
<br>In mid-1796 Tatham learned from Holland of the deaths of Jagger and Linnell, Tr&eacute;court's terminal illness, and his master's reduced activity owing to increasing ill health. In the face of the advancing French, potential patrons had returned to Britain and the acquisition of fragments was impossible, and Tatham left Rome on 9 July 1796. He reached Venice by 13 July and then travelled, drawing all the way, via Prague, Dresden, and Berlin and Potsdam, before arriving back in England in September.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career and marriage</h2>Tatham first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1797, the earliest of fifty-three designs he was to exhibit there up to 1836. Except for a brief encounter in Italy with Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, which was to prove fruitful, he had been singularly unsuccessful on his tour in attracting patronage, preferring to await what &#145;time and convenience may bring about&#146;  (V&amp;A, D.1479&#150;1551&#150;1898, fol. 18). Recognizing &#145;that accurate Drawings upon the spot, might turn to good account in a publication&#146;  (ibid.), he spent two years working on the 102 plates showing the best examples from Holland's collection, and published in 1799 <span class="italic">Etchings of ancient ornamental architecture drawn from the originals in Rome and other parts of Italy during the years 1795 and 1796</span>. Of the 210 subscribers, almost a third were architects and craftsmen. The linear style which in Italy had been an expedient of time now became one of cost to ensure wide availability: his use of &#145;chaste outline&#146; reflected the simplicity he advocated in providing &#145;a true picture of the original&#146;  (ibid., fol. 8).<br>
<br>Tatham aimed to make accessible &#145;an accurate delineation of the best approved specimens&#146; of antique ornament, &#145;a map to the study of Nature&#146;, enabling designers to exercise their genius and imagination, but &#145;an imagination corrected by judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Etchings of Ancient Ornamental Architecture</span>, 3, 6). More polemically, he criticized the otherwise &#145;matchless&#146; Piranesi and, by implication, Robert Adam as undiscriminating classicists for having used decoration in a highly subjective way that showed a dangerous indifference to the integrity of classical sources. A second edition of <span class="italic">Etchings</span> also appeared in a German translation in Weimar, Goethe's city, in 1805, and a third in London in 1810. Some remaining pieces were published as <span class="italic">Fragments of Grecian and Roman Architectural Ornaments</span> in 1806, by which time the title had significantly been altered, and both works were republished in a single volume in 1826. Tatham's drawings had first informed Holland's work at Southill House, Bedfordshire, remodelled 1796&#150;1800 for Samuel Whitbread (1764&#150;1816), but the published plates soon influenced the work of others, notably the firm in which Tatham's brother Thomas was a partner, Marsh and Tatham (later Marsh, Tatham and Bailey), and the firm of Vuillamy.<br>
<br>Tatham's first independent commission was for an interior at Stoke Edith, Herefordshire, for the Hon. Edward Foley MP, together with a cottage and park gate. In an unusual exploded drawing dated September 1800 Tatham placed sofas facing each other and at right angles to the fireplace, providing one of the earliest instances of such an informal arrangement in England. For Foley he also made a survey of Great Malvern priory church, Worcestershire, and gave an estimate for repairs in 1802. After Foley's death in 1803 ended hopes of further patronage, Tatham designed a monument to him, executed by Robert Bloor, in Stoke Edith church, Herefordshire. A more significant commission, for the earl of Carlisle at Castle Howard, Yorkshire, was the fitting up in 1800&#150;01 of Sir Thomas Robinson's palladian west wing of 1753&#150;9 as a sculpture gallery and museum. Other galleries were completed in 1811&#150;12. The groined coving, continuous arch mouldings, and rooms, alternately cubes and double cubes, were influential on gallery design, notably on John Soane's Dulwich Picture Gallery, London (1811&#150;14). Tatham published <span class="italic">The Gallery at Castle Howard</span> and <span class="italic">Representations of a Greek Vase</span> in 1811 and also <span class="italic">The Mausoleum at Castle Howard</span> (designed 1729&#150;36 by Nicholas Hawksmoor) in 1812. He also carried out work for the earl at Naworth Castle, Cumberland.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1801 Tatham married Harriet (1780&#150;1834), daughter of William Williams, a button-maker, of 103 St Martin's Lane, London, at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields (Harriet's elder sister had died in 1799 after only a year of marriage to Tatham's elder brother Henry). They moved soon afterwards to a house designed by Tatham at 35 Alpha Road, St John's Wood, then still in the country. The house became a focus of artistic activity: visitors included William Blake, Benjamin Robert Haydon, and Samuel Palmer. Charles and Harriet had four sons and six daughters: Caroline (1804&#150;1842); Frederick (1805&#150;1878), who became a painter and sculptor and a close friend of Blake; Arthur (1808&#150;1874), for over forty years rector of Broadoak and Boconoc, Cornwall, and prebendary of Exeter Cathedral; Julia (1811&#150;1881), who married George Richmond, the portrait painter; Edmund (<i>b</i>. 1822) and Robert-Bristow (1824&#150;1881), both of whom emigrated to Natal in 1850; Harriet; and Maria, Augusta, and Georgiana, all three of whom married in the 1840s.<br>
<br>In 1799 Tatham submitted designs to the Treasury for a national monument in commemoration of recent naval victories. Having heard nothing by 1802, he published the designs that year, dedicating them to the earl of Carlisle. In his only known excursions into designing medals Tatham was responsible for the Rumford medal of the Royal Society of 1802 and the board of agriculture medal for Francis, fifth duke of Bedford (1765&#150;1802), struck between 1803 and 1805. In <span class="italic">Designs for Ornamental Plate</span> (1806) he decried the prevalence in metalwork of &#145;light and insignificant forms&#146; devoid of &#145;good Ornament&#146; and recommended instead &#145;Massiveness&#146; as &#145;the principal characteristic of good Plate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Designs for Ornamental Plate</span>, preface). From Tatham's drawing of the Barberini candelabrum (the basis of pl. 16 to the <span class="italic">Designs</span>) William Pitts made an attenuated silver-gilt candelabrum for the second Earl Spencer at Althorp in 1800, which, together with the mahogany candelabrum for Carlton House (Kenwood House, London) and a pair of candelabra cast in bronze (Basildon Park, Berkshire), demonstrate precisely those transpositions of scale, medium, and form advocated by Tatham.<h2>
<a name="Architecturalworks"></a>Architectural works</h2>Tatham's architectural work to 1820, much of which has been either radically altered or destroyed, comprised mainly alterations, both internal and external, and additions, such as cottages, garden buildings, park gates, and entrance lodges, at Cheshunt Nunnery, Hertfordshire (<i>c</i>.1802), for William Butt; Wilton Park, Wiltshire (1803&#150;5; dem. 1967), characterized by severe, sharp-edged, almost abstract geometrical blocks, with minimal decoration, for James Dupr&eacute;, and Dropmore, Buckinghamshire (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;9), equally uncompromising for Lady Greville; Balgowan (<i>c</i>.1806), for Colonel Thomas Graham (later Lord Lynedoch), and Ochtertyre, Perthshire, including a Gothic mausoleum (1809), for Sir Patrick Murray; Trentham Park, Staffordshire (1807&#150;8), for the second marquess of Stafford; Althorp, Northamptonshire (1809), for Earl Spencer; and Cowsfield Wiltshire (1814; dem.), for Sir Arthur Paget. Houses for which he was entirely responsible seem few: Cowdray Lodge (now Cowdray Park), Sussex (<i>c</i>.1800; rebuilt 1876), for W. S. Poyntz; Roche Court (<i>c</i>.1805) for Francis T. Egerton and Broxmore House (<i>c</i>.1810; dem.), Wiltshire, for R. Bristow; Lynedoch Lodge, Perthshire (1807&#150;9; dem.), for Colonel Thomas Graham; and Hennerton House, Berkshire (<i>c</i>.1817; partly dem; later additions), in which elliptical arches are the principal motif, for C. F. Johnson. In London he added to Cleveland House a new, top-lit west picture gallery, the west front to St James's Park, and a tetrastyle Doric portico (1803&#150;6; dem. 1840) for the second marquess of Stafford. For the earl of Carlisle he designed a library (<i>c</i>.1805) at 12 Grosvenor Place. He designed a picture gallery (1807) for the first Lord Yarborough at Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire, and published <span class="italic">The Gallery at Brocklesby</span> in 1811. His grim mausoleum (1807&#150;8) at Trentham, combining Egyptian pylon and stepped pyramid from Halicarnassus, remains his most extreme statement of severe primitivism and austere monumentalism.<br>
<br>In 1819 Tatham was accused of negligence concerning repairs at Castle Howard, and although the arbitrator found in his favour, he incurred great expense. On several other occasions he was involved in litigation, and the consequent desertion by his wealthy and noble patrons and his refusal to work for builders led ultimately to the ruin of his practice. Between 1820 and 1836, when his architectural career ended, Tatham's work comprised interior decorations in a sumptuous neo-classical style for the fourth earl of Albemarle at Quidenham Hall, Norfolk (<i>c</i>.1820), and in Hampshire a porticoed house, Rookesbury (1821&#150;5), which was adversely criticized by C. R. Cockerell as severe and idiosyncratic, for the Revd W. Garnier, alterations and additions for William Sloane-Stanley at Paultons (1826&#150;8; dem. 1955), and a rectory at Morestead (1835&#150;6). He also wrote the letterpress for John Coney's <span class="italic">Ancient Cathedrals</span> (1829&#150;31). Of his many unexecuted designs one, dated 1827, for the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and another for <span class="italic">A Mansion for the Duke of Wellington</span> demonstrate the extent of Tatham's talent and aspirations.<br>
<br>On 13 January 1834 Tatham's wife Harriet died, aged fifty-four; she was buried in Brompton cemetery. His house and valuable collection were sold; much of the latter went to Sir John Soane's Museum, where it has since remained. His final submission to the Royal Academy, in 1836, was an earlier design for a picture gallery at Bridgewater House, St James's. The following year the duchess of Sutherland, the Rt Hon. Thomas Grenville, and other friends secured for Tatham, then sixty-five, the post of warden of Trinity Hospital, Greenwich. That year he drew up plans to renovate the hospital's garden and chapel, and made a drawing of what he conjectured to have been the original appearance of the tomb of Henry Howard, first earl of Northampton, the hospital's founder. Visitors were &#145;much struck by the pleasing tranquillity&#146; which pervaded the hospital under Tatham's wardenship  (Mercers' Company, C. H. Tatham MS 1/116, 8). He published two addresses &#145;given to the aged poor men&#146; of Trinity Hospital in 1837 and 1841. Tatham died there, probably from the dyspepsia from which he suffered all his life, on 10 April 1842, aged seventy-one, having ended his days happily and usefully, and was buried in the hospital chapel. &#145;To him&#146;, wrote Joseph Gwilt in 1853, &#145;perhaps more than any other person, may be attributed the rise of the Anglo-Greek style which still prevails&#146;  (Papworth, 3.104).<br>
