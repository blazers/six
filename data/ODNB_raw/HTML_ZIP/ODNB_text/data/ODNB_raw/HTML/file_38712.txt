<span class="headword">Featherstonehaugh,  George William</span>  (1780&#150;1866), <span class="occ">geologist and diplomatist</span>, was born on 9 April 1780 in London, the second child and only son of George Featherstonehaugh (1744&#150;1780), a lead merchant of Southwark, descended from a formerly wealthy Northumberland family, and his wife, Dorothy Simpson (1751&#150;1847). His father died the year that George was born, and his mother returned with her children to her native Scarborough, where she supported her family by running a millinery shop.<br>
<br>Educated at the Revd Robert Howard's school at Throxenby, and Stepney House, near Scarborough, Featherstonehaugh developed a keen interest in mineralogy and natural history. Unable to afford a university education he travelled on the continent in 1799&#150;1800 and then established an import export agency in Leghorn. By 1804 business reverses had ruined his prospects and he tried commercial life in London for two years before sailing for Boston in 1807. The following year he met Sarah (Sally) Duane (1775&#150;1828), who had inherited land near Schenectady, New York. They married on 6 November 1808. The couple later had four children. Featherstonehaugh set to work to farm his wife's estate on scientific principles, importing bloodstock on a grand scale. He served as corresponding secretary to the state board of agriculture and, together with the board's president, Stephen Van Rensselaer, he promoted the construction of a railway from Schenectady to Albany, obtaining a charter in 1826 to incorporate the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road Company (the first successful railway in the United States).<br>
<br>In 1826 Featherstonehaugh returned to England to research railway developments. He received instruction from the geologist William Smith and in 1827 was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London. Featherstonehaugh's wife died upon their return to New York, on 6 May 1828; their house burnt to the ground the following year. Featherstonehaugh abandoned agriculture, resigned as a director of the railway, and in 1831 moved to Philadelphia to focus on intellectual pursuits. In the same year, on 28 January, he married Charlotte Williams Carter (1812&#150;1879) of Virginia; they had three children. Also in 1831, after publishing two literary efforts and delivering a lecture series on geology, Featherstonehaugh founded the <span class="italic">Monthly American Journal of Geology and Natural History</span>. Beset by problems, Featherstonehaugh's periodical ceased publication in 1832. Nevertheless, it had raised his public profile and in 1834, supported by Roderick Murchison, he won appointment as the United States government's first geologist to survey the structure and mineral resources of Arkansas and adjacent territories. His official report appeared the following year; he published a popular account in 1844. In 1835, elected to the Royal Society, he surveyed parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, again producing a detailed report and, in 1846, a popular version criticizing America's territorial aggression and demagoguery. In 1837 Featherstonehaugh conducted a third reconnaissance of mining regions in Wisconsin, Missouri, North Carolina, and neighbouring states. While withdrawal of funding prevented his completing a geological map of the United States, Featherstonehaugh broadened understanding of the structure of North America through application of the stratigraphical and causal theories of his English geological colleagues.<br>
<br>In 1839 Featherstonehaugh was appointed by Palmerston as a boundary commissioner to survey the territory disputed between the United States and Britain on the Maine&#150;New Brunswick border. Accompanied by Richard Zachariah Mudge of the Ordnance Survey, he conducted two months of hard field research to build a case, based on scientific observations and a political interpretation of geological formations, to support Britain's claim to this wilderness. Britain praised his 1840 report as objective, while the United States condemned it as the concoction of a viper who had taken advantage of his publicly funded geological knowledge to sell out his adopted country. Featherstonehaugh continued to support the British position, but the Webster&#150;Ashburton treaty of 1842 divided the territory between the rivals.<br>
<br>Agitating for a new diplomatic role Featherstonehaugh was rewarded with the British consulship at Le Havre in 1844, a position he held until his death there on 27 or 28 September 1866. The high point of his otherwise routine tenure was his dramatic role in helping Louis Philippe escape to England during the revolution of 1848. Buried at Le Havre, Featherstonehaugh was remembered in obituaries in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Geological Society</span>. He was survived by his second wife. His remains were moved to the family vault at Tunbridge Wells on 11 April 1889.<br>
<br>A tall, gaunt, fastidious teetotaller, Featherstonehaugh cut an odd figure on the American frontier. His prejudices against the informality, materialism, and cultural backwardness of Jacksonian America did little to endear him to his hosts; his blatant &eacute;litism and bullying of subordinates revealed an arrogant authoritarianism based on unwavering faith in the superiority of the English upper classes. A tory and an Anglican, Featherstonehaugh was a complex man of intense feelings who appreciated the beauty of nature and ably recorded the startling variety of life, including the tragedy of the American Indians. Intelligent, observant, and adventurous, Featherstonehaugh successfully changed careers four times despite terrible setbacks. While he found his most congenial work in his latter years as a consul, his fame rests on his pioneering work in the United States as a geological explorer and publicist.<br>
