<span class="headword">Gissing,  Algernon Fred</span>  (1860&#150;1937), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 25 November 1860 at 55 Westgate, Wakefield, Yorkshire, the third son of Thomas Waller Gissing (1829&#150;1870), a pharmaceutical chemist, and Margaret (1832&#150;1913), the daughter of William Bedford, a solicitor's managing clerk. There Gissing attended Back Lane School; then, following his father's death in 1870, he became a boarder at Lindow Grove School, Alderley Edge, Cheshire, together with his brothers William Gissing and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33416/', "George Robert Gissing (1857&#150;1903)")</script>. After receiving his LLB from London University in 1882 Algernon Gissing set up as a solicitor in his native town, playing a modest part in local cultural affairs. Clients failing to present themselves, he boldly opted for literature a few years later, living on a small legacy from a paternal great-aunt. On 8 September 1887 he married Catherine (1859&#150;1937), daughter of James Bennett Baseley, an outfitter with Wakefield connections, and they settled in Broadway, Worcestershire. For fifty years they lived in rural areas of the midlands and the north, invariably used as settings in his fiction. Although he published thirty books, none brought him in more than a mere pittance; nor did his half-hearted attempts at securing some other remunerative employment ever succeed. To the end of his life he eked out his meagre earnings by borrowing from his relatives and friends money which he rarely repaid. The birth of five children increased his difficulties, and his son Alwin in old age equated his father's clinging to unsuccessful novel-writing with a curse on the family. Five times between 1904 and 1918 he received grants from the Royal Literary Fund. Penury and seclusion were unpropitious to a badly needed renewal of inspiration.<br>
<br>Besides Gissing's booklets on Broadway (1904) and Ludlow (1905), and <span class="italic">The Footpath Way in Gloucestershire</span> (1924), his published work consists of twenty-five novels, ten of them in multi-volume form, and two collections of short stories. Very few went into a second edition. He ceased writing fiction just before the First World War, but his undying interest in country life led him to contribute a series of &#145;New rural rides&#146; to the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in the 1920s. While no book of his roused critical enthusiasm, his artistic conscientiousness was acknowledged, and his true feeling for nature, as reflected in his descriptions of north-country scenery, duly praised. So were his rustics, occasionally likened to Thomas Hardy's. His experimentation with Meredithian complexity, notably in <span class="italic">A Masquerader</span> (1892), met with little favour, however, and his style was criticized for its affectation and grammatical oddities. The weaknesses of his plots and sometimes unconvincing characterization were found trying by many reviewers as well as by his brother George, with whose superior novelistic achievements his stories constantly invited comparison. By common consent his better work is to be found in <span class="italic">A Moorland Idyl</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Scholar of Bygate</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">A Secret of the North Sea</span> (1900). After a pathetic twenty-five-year struggle he acknowledged himself beaten as a novelist, as repeated assurance that one was above the average was no passport to posterity. Algernon Gissing died of heart disease at Bloxham, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 5 February 1937, his invalid wife surviving him by barely three months. He was buried in the Bloxham cemetery on 9 February.<br>
