<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quick,  John</span>  (1748&#150;1831), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Whitechapel, London, the son of a brewer. He allegedly left home when he was about fourteen to become an actor and joined a strolling company run by Oliver Carr. Before he was eighteen he supposedly played Altamont in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span> at Fulham or Croydon and Hamlet, Richard III, Romeo, George Barnwell, Jaffeir, and Tancred.<br>
<br>Quick's versatility as an actor recommended him to Samuel Foote at the Haymarket, where he made his first appearance on 18 June 1766, as Folly in Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">The Miser</span> and as Jasper in David Garrick's <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>. He also acted that season in Barry's company at the King's Theatre, first appearing there on 13 August 1766. Although he returned to Foote's company in the summer of 1767, he came more prominently to notice when he played Beau Mordecai in <span class="italic">Love &agrave; la Mode</span> for Edward Shuter's benefit at Covent Garden on 9 June 1767. Charles Macklin, who wrote the play, instructed Quick in the part. Subsequently recommended to George Colman, then a patentee of Covent Garden Theatre, Quick commenced an engagement there by playing James, in Fielding's <span class="italic">The Mock Doctor</span>, on 14 September 1767. A further boost to his career occurred when, on the recommendation of Joseph Younger, he was cast as Mungo, in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Padlock</span>, on 23 October 1770. Although he was reluctant to play the part so soon after Dibdin, Quick's success paved the way to future laurels. He subsequently created Tony Lumpkin in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (14 March 1773), winning the praises of both the public and of Goldsmith, and two Sheridan characters, Bob Acres in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (17 January 1775) and Isaac Mendoza in <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (9 November 1776). Quick became one of the leading performers at Covent Garden, able to choose the characters he played, and a great favourite of George III.<br>
<br>Quick also appeared in Bristol in 1768 and 1769, playing relatively minor roles, and from 1775 to 1778 he was a shareholder and joint manager of the Bristol theatre. At Bristol, on 16 November 1772, Quick married Anna Parker (<i>c</i>.1751&#150;1819), a clergyman's daughter. For his Bristol benefit in September 1776 he played Richard III; although he commenced the role seriously, he soon succumbed to burlesque when he found his audience inclined to mirth. After he had disposed of his share in the theatre he played summer engagements at Liverpool, Richmond, Weymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, Brighton, Windsor, Cheltenham, and Gloucester, although he frequently revisited Bristol, partly to visit the Hotwells for health reasons.<br>
<br>When Quick's articles expired at the end of the 1797&#150;8 Covent Garden season, he stipulated that the following season he should not play in both the comedy and the farce on the same night because of poor health. Harris, the manager, objecting to Quick's demand, gave his line of parts to Joseph Shepherd Munden. Thus, says Genest, Quick &#145;seems to have thrown himself out of a good engagement rather foolishly&#146;  (Genest, 7.378). When he later undertook an engagement at Bath and Bristol, where he played in both play and farce, he made sure the bills stated that he was acting by permission of the manager of Covent Garden. Gilliland states that Quick subsequently undertook a number of lucrative engagements in the provinces, visiting Edinburgh, York, Hull, Birmingham, and Liverpool. On 9 May 1799 he made his first appearance on the Drury Lane stage for Elizabeth Leake's benefit. The remainder of his professional career consisted of sporadic appearances in the patent theatres and a number of provincial tours. Quick would, adds Gilliland in 1808, return to the London stage if an adequate offer was made. In fact a manuscript letter to the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> from its Edinburgh correspondent in March 1800 forbears detailing Quick's recent engagement there on the grounds that &#145;he is still I hope to be considered a London Performer&#146;. His last appearance was at the Haymarket Theatre for Mrs Mattocks's benefit, on 24 May 1813.<br>
<br>Quick, says Hazlitt, made &#145;an excellent, self-important, busy, strutting, money-getting citizen; or crusty old guardian, in a brown suit and a bob wig&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, January 1820). He was widely praised for his performances as old men. &#145;There was a peculiarity in his voice which rendered his old characters exceedingly whimsical&#146;  (Jenkins, 2.91). He was also successful in Shakespearian roles, such as the First Gravedigger, Dromio of Ephesus, Launce, and Launcelot Gobbo. For his Covent Garden benefit on 6 April 1790 he again attempted Richard III, in earnest, with slightly more success than at Bristol, but his audience evidently hoped for a comic performance.<br>
<br>Boaden saw Quick as an actor &#145;of very great and peculiar merits&#146;  (Russell, 211). His squat figure seemed perfect for many of the parts he played: &#145;The person of Mr Quick&#146;, wrote Gilliland, &#145;is happily formed for a comedian; with features beaming with good humour, he has eyes particularly expressive of mirth, and a facetiousness of disposition&#146;  (Gilliland, 2.926). The author of the <span class="italic">Candid and Impartial Strictures</span> remembered Quick as:<blockquote>long and deservedly a favourite of the town&#151;his comic talents were purely original&#151;they were not richly fraught with a mellowness of humour, but still they possessed a certain quaintness and whimsicality which proved an irresistible incentive to laughter &hellip; he had not much variety, but his entrances were always the signal for hearty merriment. (<span class="italic">Strictures</span>, 52)</blockquote>Pasquin refers to Quick<blockquote>
<div>With his gibes and his quiddities, cranks and his wiles,<br>
</div>
<div>His croak and his halt, and his smirks and his smiles<br>
</div> (Pasquin, 51)</blockquote>while Bellamy declares him the &#145;prince of low comedians&#146;  (Bellamy, 23) and a natural successor to Parsons.<br>
<br>Yet aspects of Quick's acting were also criticized. The <span class="italic">Strictures</span> felt his voice, deportment, and action were always the same, whatever the part. Early in his career he was accused of grimacing: &#145;he is now too apt &hellip; to screw the muscles of his face into many ridiculous forms&#146;  (Hawkins, 50). That his acting was viewed ambivalently and that his departure from Covent Garden might also have been hastened by changes in fashion is implicit in <span class="italic">Records of a Stage Veteran</span>: &#145;his acting went out of fashion when a more intellectual school appeared. Munden knew little, but Quick knew less; noise and extravagance were with him substituted for nature and humour.&#146;  (Russell, 210) He was unfavourably compared with William Dowton, &#145;who rounded off the square corners of Quick's old men, and brought them nearer if not quite to the standard of nature and truth&#146;. As a result he &#145;quitted the stage in disgust&#146;, while still at the height of his powers. According to the same account he was extremely vain:<blockquote>He believed in no living actor but himself. The dead he lauded indiscriminately (except Foote of whom he equally disliked to speak or hear), and the mere mention of the name of a new performer playing one of his original characters would make him silent for the evening. (ibid.)</blockquote>Most accounts of Quick paint a kinder portrait. &#145;In private life&#146;, said Richard Jenkins, he &#145;was much esteemed; though not extravagant, he was generous; and, though partial to a domestic life, was occasionally a cheerful and facetious companion abroad&#146;  (Jenkins, 2.92). John O'Keeffe recalled &#145;many instances of good will and kindness&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 2.333) from him. Ann Mathews, who called him &#145;Little Quick (the retired Dioclesian of Islington), with his squeak like a Bart'lemew fiddle&#146;, refers to him as &#145;a pleasant little fellow&#146;, who had not &#145;an atom of improper consequence in his composition&#146;  (Russell, 210). Fond of punch, he had been warned by his doctors while still at Covent Garden to give it up or it would be the death of him, but he continued drinking it until the end of his life. He was reputedly an early riser and a great walker. Up until the last day of his life he regularly visited the King's Head opposite Islington church, although a newspaper clipping in the Billy Rose collection describes him visiting the Mail Coach.<br>
<br>Quick died at his home, 122 Upper Street, Islington, on 4 April 1831, at the age of eighty-four. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> referred to him as &#145;the [John] Liston of his day&#146; and as &#145;one of the last of the Garrick school&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 101, 1831, 474). He was buried in the old chapel of ease at Islington church, Lower Holloway Road, beside his wife, who had died in 1819. He had reputedly retired with a fortune of &pound;10,000 and was able to leave significant amounts to both offspring. His will, which was in a very tattered condition&#151;according to an affidavit from his servant, he had constantly carried it about with him in a side pocket of his coat&#151;was proved at Doctor's Commons.<br>
