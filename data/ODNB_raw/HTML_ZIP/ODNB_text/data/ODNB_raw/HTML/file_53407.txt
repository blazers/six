</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Occom,  Samson</span>  (1723&#150;1792), <span class="occ">leader of the Mohegan Indians and Presbyterian clergyman</span>, was born in a Mohegan village near New London, Connecticut, in 1723, the son of Joshua Ockham and Sarah Samson, both Mohegans. At seventeen he was converted to Christianity by James Davenport, an apostle of the early American religious great awakening. The Pious Mohegan, as Occom came to be known, embraced Christianity as a strategy for American Indian survival. He was appointed to the Mohegan council by the sachem Ben Uncas II on 1 July 1742. On 6 December 1743 Occom enrolled in Eleazar Wheelock's Preparatory School in Lebanon, Connecticut, aided by a stipend from the Church of England's Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). In the course of five years he obtained a rudimentary education in English and theology. Poor health prevented Occom from transferring to Yale College, but his remarkable progress as a scholar motivated Wheelock to establish Moor's Indian Charity School in 1754, a special institution to train Indian missionaries.<br>
<br>Late in 1749 Occom was employed as schoolmaster by the Montauk of Long Island, also serving as their minister, scribe, and legal adviser until 1761. In 1751 he married Mary Fowler, a Montauk (<i>b</i>. 1730), who outlived him and with whom he had eleven children. Occom was ordained by the Long Island presbytery at Easthampton on 30 August 1759. Between 1761 and 1763 Occom journeyed three times to the Oneida in New York, but his missionary endeavours there were upset by the pan-American rising against the British, the Pontiac War, which erupted in 1763. At the close of 1764 the SPG hired him as a minister to the Mohegan and other Christian Indian communities in Connecticut. He was also taken into service by the newly established Connecticut Board of Correspondents of the Scotch Society.<br>
<br>Following his return to Mohegan in 1764, Occom became embroiled in a long-standing land dispute between a Mohegan faction and the Connecticut assembly, known as the Mason controversy. In sympathizing with the Mohegan faction demanding restitution, Occom incurred the disapproval of his superiors, who threatened to revoke his licence. On 12 March 1765 he wrote a letter of apology to the commissioners for his &#145;imprudent, rash, and offensive Conduct&#146;, but his relation with the SPG was strained thereafter (Blodgett, 79&#150;80; Love, 127; Richardson, 28&#150;9).<br>
<br>Late in 1765 Occom accompanied the Revd Nathaniel Whitaker on a fund-raising tour to Great Britain. They set sail from Boston on 23 December 1765 and landed at Brixham in Tor Bay on 3 February 1766. From there they proceeded to the Revd George Whitefield's residence in London. Occom delivered over 300 sermons throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland, before departing again in the spring of 1768. He was patronized by numerous British dignitaries, developing a lifelong friendship with Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, and John Thornton. The erudite Mohegan preacher collected nearly &pound;12,000 for Wheelock's school. Most of the donations, however, were used to establish Dartmouth College, which was granted a royal charter in 1769.<br>
<br>Occom's occupational prospects dimmed after his return to New England. The SPG refused to re-employ him, and his relationship with Wheelock also deteriorated when he accused the cleric of misappropriating the moneys he had generated for the express purpose of educating Indians. This charge proved well grounded as Dartmouth soon evolved into an &eacute;litist institution for white students. Although Occom received some financial support from the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, his subsequent activities were beset with privation.<br>
<br>Some time in 1773 Occom developed the plan to found Brothertown, an independent community of Christian Indians in Oneida territory in New York. With the assistance of two relatives, Joseph Johnson (1752&#150;1776), a Mohegan, and David Fowler (1735&#150;1807), a Montauk, Occom enlisted participants from among the Mohegan, Mashantucket, Stonington, Farmington, Charleston, Niantic, and Montauk. The project was postponed temporarily because of the outbreak of the American War of Independence. Occom and his family finally emigrated to Brothertown in the spring of 1789. He taught and ministered at Brothertown and the neighbouring Christian Indian community of New Stockbridge until his death, in New Stockbridge, on 14 July 1792. He was probably buried near Utica.<br>
<br>Occom's major work is <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul</span> (1772), which went through at least nineteen editions by the turn of the century. Several hymns contained in his <span class="italic">Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span> (1774) are believed to be original. Occom also produced a brief ethnography entitled &#145;An account of the Montauk Indians, on Long Island&#146; (1809).<br>
<br>The descendants of the New England Christian Indians still honour Occom as an elder who helped them survive through difficult times. On the recommendation of the Montauk Historical Society, Samson Occom day was celebrated in June 1970. The Brothertown Indian Nation, which at the start of the twenty-first century was seeking federal recognition in Wisconsin, regards him as its founding father.<br>
