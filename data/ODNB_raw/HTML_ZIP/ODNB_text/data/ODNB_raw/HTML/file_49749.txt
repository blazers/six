<span class="headword">Duckett, Sir  Lionel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was the son of William Duckett of Flintham, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Jane Redman, of Harwood Castle, Yorkshire. His first wife was Mary, the daughter of Hugh Leighton, of Leighton, Shropshire, with whom he had one son, George, who died young, and his second was Jane, the daughter of Humphrey Packington and the wealthy widow of Humphrey Baskerfeld (or Baskerville) of London, who had four daughters from her first marriage and with whom he had a son, Thomas.<br>
<br>In 1537, after his apprenticeship to John Colet in London, Duckett gained the freedom of the Mercers' Company. Thereafter he developed extensive commercial and business interests and became one of the most successful merchants in the city of London. He was a prominent member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers, trading extensively in cloth at Antwerp and other markets in northern Europe and importing wine in exchange. In 1557 he secured a patent for the import of felts and hats from Spain and Portugal in partnership with Henry Viner. During his career he was a powerful supporter of new commercial initiatives. He was a founder member of the Russia Company in 1555, and served as an assistant in 1569 and a governor in 1575 and 1577. He was involved in promoting trading ventures to Guinea in 1558 and 1562. He was also a backer of John Hawkins's slaving voyages of 1562 and 1567. He was a member of the Spanish Company in 1577, and a supporter of Martin Frobisher's attempts to find a north-west passage from 1577 to 1579. Although Frobisher's voyages failed, Duckett later joined Adrian Gilbert's abortive fellowship for the discovery of the passage. In 1577 he was a leading promoter of the Russia Company's attempts to establish a whale fishery in the Arctic, with the help of certain Biscayan mariners skilled in whaling.<br>
<br>Duckett acquired other business interests in the city, which brought him into close contact with the court. With a small group of leading merchant adventurers, which included his close business associate Sir Thomas Gresham, he advanced money to the crown, including a loan of &pound;30,000 to Elizabeth in 1560 at 10 per cent interest. He loaned &pound;160 to the crown in 1562 to pay for an English garrison in Normandy, and other royal loans were arranged in 1569 and 1570. In 1560 or 1561 he was involved in a loan of &pound;12,000 to the king of Sweden, though it remained unpaid in 1582. He was associated with Gresham in building the Royal Exchange from 1565 to 1568, and with Gresham he served as a commissioner for clearing the accounts for Frobisher's north-west ventures. In 1567 he became heavily involved in the attempt to mine and smelt copper at Keswick, using the expertise of German miners. He was a shareholder in the Company of Mines Royal, and was appointed governor of the company in May 1568. The venture brought Duckett into close contact with Sir William Cecil, who was an investor in the company. In 1568 he became involved with Geoffrey Duckett, possibly a kinsman, in the manufacture of light cloth at Coventry.<br>
<br>Commercial success enabled Duckett to become a leading figure in the city of London. He was master of the Mercers' Company in 1567, 1572, 1578, and 1584. He served as an auditor for the city from 1559 to 1561 and again from 1585 to 1586. In 1564&#150;5 he served as one of the city's sheriffs. He was elected alderman of Aldersgate ward in 1564, but moved to Bassishaw during 1567, and served there in this capacity until 1587. He was mayor of London in 1572&#150;3 during a difficult period of dearth and discontent. To maintain good order in London he advised that the issue of writs of habeas corpus be restricted for cases brought by the city authorities against disturbers of the peace. As mayor he attempted also to curb excessive feasting and drinking in the city, especially by the meaner sort, though at the risk of encouraging personal criticism and complaint. He was knighted on 2 February 1573. That same year he was elected president of St Thomas's Hospital; and he served as president of Bethlem and Bridewell hospitals from 1569 to 1573 and from 1580 to 1586. In 1576 he was appointed to a commission investigating criminal activity throughout the realm.<br>
<br>Although several of his business ventures were unprofitable, Duckett became one of the wealthiest merchants in London during his lifetime. He also acquired wide-ranging landed interests. He began purchasing former monastic and chantry lands in Surrey, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire in 1553, additional lands in Somerset and Devon were acquired in 1556 and 1557, and by the time of his death he owned other property in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, and Kent. His wealth was so great that he reputedly gave 8000 marks to each of his four stepdaughters, and would have given them more had it not appeared unbecoming. He died in August 1587 in London. By the terms of his will, drawn up in 1585 but later modified, he left &pound;200 to the Mercers' Company to provide loans for its younger members, &pound;100 to Christ's Hospital, and various smaller bequests to the poor. The bulk of his personal estate was left to his wife and only son, Thomas, though the latter's share was reduced because of his marriage to Margaret Nelson without his father's approval.<br>
