</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Romilly,  Esmond Marcus David</span>  (1918&#150;1941), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 10 June 1918 at 15 Pimlico Road, London, the second of the two children of Colonel Bertram Henry Samuel Romilly DSO (1878&#150;1940), a professional army officer of Huguenot descent who served as military governor of Galilee province, Egypt, and his wife, Nellie Margaret, daughter of Lady Henrietta Blanche Hozier and an unknown man&#151;certainly not her husband, Sir Henry Montague Hozier (1838&#150;1907), but possibly the author Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (1840&#150;1922). Stephen Spender characterized Colonel Romilly as &#145;a kind of perambulating vacuum&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 16 Nov 1985, 29), and the possessive, volatile Nellie was a far more influential figure in the lives of Esmond and his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_60281">Giles [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Something of the family circumstances&#151;marital incompatibility and the favouring of the elder child&#151;are represented in Nellie's autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Misdeal</span>, published in 1932 under the pseudonym Anna Gerstein.<br>
<br>Both boys, who had quarrelled frequently during childhood, were educated at Wellington College, where they became allies in a rebellion against the militaristic and conservative values of the public-school system. Giles withdrew from the school's &#145;technically voluntary&#146;  (Romilly and Romilly, 123) Officers' Training Corps and declared himself a communist. He later admitted: &#145;I had no knowledge of anything, only opinions&#146;  (ibid., 142), and the same might be said of Esmond, who gradually educated himself politically by corresponding with assorted left-wing groups, and provoked considerable anger in 1933 by inserting pacifist leaflets in the hymnbooks at the school's armistice day service. The headmaster, tipped off by &#145;a very high official at Scotland Yard&#146;  (ibid., 218) who was concerned that the school was being targeted by a &#145;red group&#146;, had already warned him that further agitation would result in expulsion. Uncowed, the brothers had decided to launch a magazine, <span class="italic">Out of Bounds</span> (&#145;Against Reaction in Public Schools&#146;). News of this enterprise reached the press in January 1934 and the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> ran an article under the headline &#145;Red menace in public schools&#146;. The headmaster insisted that the project should be abandoned, whereupon Esmond ran away from school, thus provoking further headlines, partly because his mother's half-sister was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32413/', "Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill")</script>. He was frequently referred to as Winston's Red Nephew.<br>
<br>Esmond Romilly established headquarters at the Parton Bookshop in Bloomsbury, a well-known meeting-place for radicals, and set about producing the first issue (of four) of his magazine, which was published, priced 1<i>s</i>., on 25 March 1934. It was written entirely by correspondents from various public schools (in several of which it was immediately banned), and was regarded by the press as half-way between a juvenile prank and an alarming confirmation of left-wing influence among the young, already apparent in the work of the Auden group of writers. Among contributors to the magazine were the editors' fellow Wellingtonian Gavin Ewart, and Philip Toynbee, who ran away from Rugby and became one of Romilly's closest friends, as described in his memoir <span class="italic">Friends Apart</span> (1954).<br>
<br>Esmond Romilly resumed his education at the progressive Bedales School, but left after one unsuccessful term. In the early hours of 29 December 1934 he and Toynbee were arrested outside the Romilly family home and charged with being drunk and disorderly. Romilly spent eighteen days in the Ponton Road remand home before being released on one year's probation, the first month of which he spent at the country home of a cousin writing his half of <span class="italic">Out of Bounds: the Education of Giles Romilly and Esmond Romilly</span>. This precocious and unexpectedly even-tempered joint autobiography was published in 1935 to largely respectful reviews and rushed through two editions. Romilly used his advance to set up with the poet and editor Roger Roughton a short-lived news agency which gathered disobliging stories about public schools to sell on to newspapers. After this venture failed, Romilly sold silk stockings door-to-door.<br>
<br>In March 1936, still only seventeen, Esmond Romilly became advertising manager of John Grierson's <span class="italic">World Film News</span> magazine. He found the job inimical and once knocked his editor unconscious during an argument. In October he gave notice and ran away (on a bicycle) to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He joined the (German) Thaelmann battalion and, after rudimentary training, saw action on the Madrid front, one of only two Englishmen to survive the battle. He contracted dysentery and was invalided back to England, where he met his second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60652/', "Jessica Lucy Freeman-Mitford (1917&#150;1996)")</script>, daughter of the second Baron Redesdale. A fellow rebel against her class and upbringing, Mitford persuaded Romilly to allow her to accompany him to Spain, where he was returning as a journalist. Within days they had fallen in love and decided to marry. Once again Esmond Romilly was in the news (&#145;Peer's Daughter Elopes to Spain&#146;), and he skilfully manipulated the press, selling his story through a friend. In the face of fierce parental opposition&#151;Mitford's family enlisted the help of the British navy and the foreign secretary, and eventually made her a ward of court&#151;they married at the British consulate at Bayonne on 18 May 1937. They subsequently had two daughters, the first of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Romilly worked on his memoir of the war, published as <span class="italic">Boadilla</span> in 1937, but had been denied a visa to journey to the battlefront at Bilbao. An attempt to make money by gambling with the advance on his book ended badly and the young couple returned to London, living at 41 Rotherhithe Street, a converted Thames-side warehouse. Romilly worked as an advertising copywriter for Graham and Gillies, but there seemed no future for him in England, and in February 1939 he and his wife departed for New York, where he worked as a freelance journalist before joining the Topping and Lloyd advertising agency. The couple subsequently toured America, contributing a series of articles to the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span> under the title &#145;Baby Bluebloods in Hobohemia&#146;, then ran a bar in Miami. In the summer of 1940 and in the wake of German advances in Europe, Romilly trained with the Canadian air force at Regina, but was disqualified from air-crew service because of a radical mastoid. After obtaining a discharge, he retrained as an observer and, having gained a commission as a pilot officer, served in England as a navigator with 58 squadron in Yorkshire. On 30 November 1941, <i>en route</i> for a raid on Hamburg, Romilly's aeroplane disappeared over the North Sea. Short, stocky, and truculent, Romilly had remained boyish in his enthusiasms and untidiness, as well as in his behaviour, which was not always scrupulous but offset by considerable charm. Marriage brought maturity, but he was still capable of childish stunts, as when he visited Eton College and stole the hats of those attending chapel, later selling them to a dealer.<br>

<a name="cosubject_60281"></a><span class="headword">Giles Samuel Bertram Romilly</span>  (1916&#150;1967), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 19 September 1916 at 92 Redcliffe Gardens, Brompton, London. Having abandoned his classical scholarship at Lincoln College, Oxford, he also went to Spain as a member of the International Brigades, in the company of Stephen Spender's secretary-companion T. A. R. Hyndman. This period of his life was appropriated, and much embellished, by his former Wellington teacher T. C. Worsley for the novel <span class="italic">Fellow Travellers</span> (1971). His mother persuaded Churchill to use his influence to prevent Giles (whom she rightly considered less robust than his brother) from taking part in fighting, so he deserted in order to receive the customary punishment of being sent to the front. He saw action with the British battalion at Brunete, then returned to England, where he joined the Communist Party and lived for a time in east London at Poplar. Abandoning the party, he became a journalist on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, working as a correspondent in Stockholm from 1938. In 1940 he became the paper's war correspondent in Norway and was captured at Narvik in April. He was imprisoned in several camps, from one of which he made an unsuccessful bid to escape in drag. In Colditz he was categorized as a <i>Prominenter</i>, a prisoner with important personal connections in England. He escaped from a fortress at Tittmoning just as the war in Europe was ending, and with his fellow prisoner of war Michael Alexander wrote a lively account of his experiences in <span class="italic">The Privileged Nightmare</span> (1954). He also contributed poems and character-sketches to <span class="italic">Penguin New Writing</span>. His other book was a novel of manners, <span class="italic">Christina Claimed</span> (1951), described by the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> as &#145;mysterious and elusive, lingering with an avocado-like distinction&#146;  (2 June 1951, 629). A dark, handsome man, with deep-set eyes, he married Mary Ball Dodd (<i>b</i>. 1927) on 11 March 1949; they had three children. The marriage was dissolved in 1962 and on 8 May 1967 he married Coral Veronica Greene (<i>b</i>. 1936/7), a schoolteacher, shortly afterwards travelling to Berkeley, California, in order to research a book he planned to write on the American novel. Prone to depression, and a heavy drinker, he died in a hotel there on 2 August 1967 after taking an overdose of tranquillizers and barbiturates.<br>
