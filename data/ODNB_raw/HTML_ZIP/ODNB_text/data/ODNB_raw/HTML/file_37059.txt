<span class="headword">Yate, Sir  Charles Edward</span>, baronet  (1849&#150;1940), <span class="occ">administrator in India and politician</span>, was born on 28 August 1849 at Holme-on-Spalding Moor, Yorkshire, the eldest of the four sons of Charles Yate (1804&#150;1860), fellow and dean of St John's College, Cambridge, and vicar of Holme-on-Spalding Moor, and his wife, Jane Anne (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of Arthur Campbell, writer to the signet, of Catrine House, Ayrshire. In November 1867, after five years at Shrewsbury School, Yate joined the 49th Royal Berkshire regiment, then based in India, as an ensign. In 1871 he was admitted to the Bombay staff corps and subsequently transferred to the Indian political service. For some years an assistant political superintendent in Rajputana, he wrote chapters on Mewar and Partabgarh for the third volume of the <span class="italic">Rajputana Gazetteer</span> (1880).<br>
<br>Yate was gazetted captain in 1879 and during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, in 1879&#150;80, returned briefly to military duty, commanding a detachment of the 29th Bombay infantry. As a member of General Roberts's staff, he was on the march from Kabul to the relief of Kandahar in August 1880 and remained as political officer in charge of the city until its evacuation in May 1881. From 1884 to 1886 he was attached to the Afghan boundary commission, a posting which supplied him with the material for a volume of descriptive letters, <span class="italic">Northern Afghanistan</span> (1888). In March 1885 Yate was British representative at Panjdeh, an oasis on Afghanistan's western frontier, when Russian troops invaded and threatened to embroil Britain in a war on Afghanistan's behalf. On 29 March, in a dramatic gesture of hospitality which typified his tendency to respond to a situation in terms of its protagonists, Yate invited the Russian officers to dine with him between the two lines of opposing soldiers. Notwithstanding the exchange of champagne toasts in no-man's-land, the Russians seized the disputed territory at dawn the following day. For his boundary work, Yate was made CSI in 1887 and CMG in 1888.<br>
<br>In 1889 Yate became the British consul at Muscat. From 1890 to 1892 he served as the political agent in Baluchistan, and in 1893 he was appointed British commissioner for settlement of the Kushk Canal question on the Russo-Afghan frontier. From 1893 to 1898 he was based at Mashhad in Persia as agent to the governor-general to Khorasan and Sistan. Although he later complained of having been denied the honours that a more prominent posting in Afghanistan would have afforded him, nevertheless his years in Mashhad spawned another descriptive book, <span class="italic">Khurasan and Sistan</span> (1900).<br>
<br>In 1898 Yate returned to India to a series of temporary postings in Rajputana. In the following year, on 18 March, he married Charlotte Heath (<i>d</i>. 1936), youngest daughter of Joseph Hume Burnley, charg&eacute; d'affaires at Dresden, with whom he had a son, who died in childhood, and two daughters, Lois (<i>b</i>. 1900) and Adelaide (<i>b</i>. 1904). In 1900 Lord Curzon appointed Yate chief commissioner of British Baluchistan. Yate relished the personal authority allowed to him in Baluchistan and was especially happy working under Curzon, whose vision of a stronger and more worthy empire he shared. Upon his retirement, in 1904, a clock tower and fountain were erected in his honour at Quetta by public subscription. He was gazetted colonel in 1901 and retired from the army in 1906.<br>
<br>Yate returned to England in 1904, hoping, as he put it to Curzon, &#145;to join in the fray on behalf of Imperialism as opposed to Little Englandism&#146;. After two unsuccessful contests, at Pontefract (1906) and Melton Mowbray (January 1910), he was elected in December 1910 Conservative MP for the Melton division. In speeches renowned for their bluntness and brevity, he pilloried the advocates of political reform in India, in particular Edwin Montagu, Liberal secretary of state for India from 1917 to 1922. Yate was for many years a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1921 he was made a baronet. He retired, reluctantly, from parliament in 1924, whereupon he moved from his constituency residence, Ashfordby House, Leicestershire, to Madeley Hall, Shropshire, home to the Yate family for several generations. He died there on 29 February 1940, aged ninety, and was survived by his daughters.<br>
