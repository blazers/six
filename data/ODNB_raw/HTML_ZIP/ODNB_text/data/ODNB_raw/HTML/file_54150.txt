<span class="headword">Campbell family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;1453), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was important in the history of the western highlands, and especially Argyll, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Recorded from about the middle of the thirteenth century, the family first came to prominence in the person of <a name="cosubject_54148"></a><span class="headword">Sir Neil Campbell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1315?)<span class="occ"></span>, who was noted for his active military and political support for the cause of King Robert I in the period after February 1306. He was later identified by John Barbour as one of the small band which accompanied Robert during his desperate flight from English and Scottish foes in the winter of 1306&#150;7, and contemporary evidence seems to confirm that he was in the king's personal entourage at this time, in particular the band into which he entered about 1308, along with Thomas Hay and Alexander Seton, to defend to the death their king and the liberty of the realm. In 1309 and 1314, moreover, he represented Robert in negotiations with the English crown. Sir Neil's loyal service resulted in a number of gains for his family and kinsmen at the expense of King Robert's enemies in the west, most notably the Macdougall lords of Argyll.<br>
<br>The most striking confirmation of the closeness of the links between Campbell and the king came in the form of Sir Neil's prestigious marriage with Robert's sister Mary Bruce, which took place either just before Mary was captured by the English in 1306 or, more probably, following her release in 1312. Shortly after Bannockburn (24 June 1314) Sir Neil, his spouse, and their son John received a grant of the earldom and other lands which had belonged to David Strathbogie, tenth earl of Atholl. Then, on 10 February 1315, Colin Campbell, who was filially Sir Neil's eldest son, was granted his father's lands of Lochawe and Ardskeodnish in free barony. Sir Neil was probably still alive when the charter was issued, but seems to have died shortly afterwards; since Colin may have been technically illegitimate, the Lochawe charter was probably intended to ensure his succession to the lands and Campbell chieftainship. The name of Colin's mother is unknown. His father was, however, apparently married to Alice, one of the two daughters and coheirs of Sir Reginald Crawford, about 1302&#150;3, after he and his brother Donald had allegedly abducted Alice and her sister. If the marriage took place it cannot be shown to have produced any children, and had in any case ended no later than 1312&#150;14, when Sir Neil married Mary Bruce.<br>
<br>Their son <a name="cosubject_54149"></a><span class="headword">John Campbell</span>, earl of Atholl  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span>, shared King Robert's favour with his parents. Besides the earldom of Atholl he also received a third of the annual rents due to the crown from the burgh of Dundee and from the royal barony of Inverbervie. He adopted the title of earl of Atholl some time after 1323, but his career was cut short by his death at the battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. There were no children of his marriage to Joanna Menteith, daughter of Sir John Menteith of Rursky and widow of Malise, seventh earl of Strathearn, and consequently the main line of the Campbells of Lochawe continued through his nephews, Dougall and <a name="cosubject_54150"></a><span class="headword">Gill-Easbuig <span class="st"> [Gillespic]</span> Campbell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1385<span class="mult">x</span>7)<span class="occ"></span>, the sons of John's half-brother Colin, who probably died about 1323. Colin's early death seems to have resulted in a redistribution of his estates among his kinsmen, with the lordship of Ardskeodnish passing to another branch of the family rather than descending to Dougall and Gill-Easbuig. By 4 July 1342 Dougall was dead and his lands, which had been forfeited to the crown, probably for supporting Edward Balliol, were granted by David II to his younger brother. In a long career, Gill-Easbuig presided over a dramatic expansion of Campbell lordship, especially in mid-Argyll, Cowal, and the Firth of Clyde. By 1369 he had acquired the lordships of Craignish, Melfort, and Strachur, as well as extensive estates in Cowal and Arran. Many of these territorial advances resulted from his close political relationship with the overlord of Cowal, Robert the Steward, who became king as Robert II in 1371.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1382 the growing influence of the Campbell chief and his family in Argyll was confirmed when Robert II granted Gill-Easbuig Campbell and his son and heir a heritable royal lieutenancy in mid-Argyll which effectively covered the territory between the lordships of Lorn and Knapdale. Gill-Easbuig was apparently still alive on 1 June 1385, but seems to have died within two years. His only known wife was Isabella Lamont, the mother of his son and successor, <a name="cosubject_54151"></a><span class="headword">Colin Campbell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1412/13)<span class="occ"></span>. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the latter's chieftainship was his marriage to Mariota Campbell, the daughter and heir of John Campbell, lord of Ardskeodnish, under a dispensation granted on 16 January 1366. Through this match the lordships of the Ardskeodnish Campbells, including Ardskeodnish and Glenorchy, were united to those of the Lochawe family. By 1395 Colin was confident enough of his regional power to use the style &#145;lord of Argyll&#146;, a long-established title which had connotations of provincial overlordship.<br>
<br>Colin Campbell died between 18 June 1412 and 19 January 1413. He left a number of children from his marriage to Mariota (although only <a href="#cosubject_54152">Duncan [<i>see below</i>]</a>, his son and successor, can be positively identified as a product of this match) and also had a number of sons from other relationships. <a name="cosubject_54152"></a><span class="headword">Duncan Campbell</span>, first Lord Campbell  (<em>d.</em> 1453)<span class="occ"></span>, had succeeded his father as lord of Lochawe by 19 January 1413. His career was initially enhanced by his marriage (probably in the 1390s) to Marjory Stewart, daughter of Robert, duke of Albany. In 1424&#150;5, however, the Albany Stewarts and their allies came under political attack from King James I. Duncan Campbell had been one of the men chosen in 1423 to go to England as surety for the payment of the king's ransom, and he was still in England in May 1425 when his brother-in-law Murdoch, duke of Albany, his cousins, Murdoch's sons, and his uncle Duncan, earl of Lennox, were all executed. After his return to Scotland, Campbell worked hard to win back the favour of the king and was noted for his service to James at the siege of Roxburgh Castle in 1436&#150;7. After the king's assassination in February 1437 Campbell identified himself with the interests of the king's widow, Queen Joan Beaufort and her infant son, James II. A rich man&#151;in 1423 his annual revenue was estimated at 1500 merks&#151;in Argyll he presided over a substantial building programme which resulted in the construction of a major centre for the exercise of secular lordship at Inveraray on Loch Fyne, and the endowment (4 August 1442) of a new ecclesiastical and religious focus for the family in the form of a secular college at Kilmun in Cowal.<br>
<br>Duncan Campbell was knighted before 1430, and by 10 August 1440 (and perhaps as early as 1437) he had been granted, or had simply adopted, the parliamentary peerage title Lord Campbell. He was still alive in February 1453, but seems to have died shortly afterwards. He was buried in the collegiate kirk of Kilmun. He was twice married. His marriage to Marjory Stewart probably produced two sons. The elder was Gillespic, who seems to have died <i>c</i>.1432 (and certainly before March 1440). Gillespic's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4481/', "Colin Campbell")</script> eventually succeeded his grandfather as chief of clan Campbell, lord of Lochawe and Lord Campbell, and went on to become first earl of Argyll. The second son born to Duncan and Marjory was Colin, first of Glenorchy and progenitor of the Breadalbane family, although some accounts claim that Colin was a son of Duncan's second wife. The latter was Margaret Stewart, daughter of Sir John Stewart of Ardgowan, an illegitimate son of King Robert III. The marriage produced a number of children, including at least three sons, Neil, Duncan, and Gillespic, who founded important cadet branches.<br>
