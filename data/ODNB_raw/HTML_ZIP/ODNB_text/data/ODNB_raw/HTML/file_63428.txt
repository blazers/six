<span class="headword">MacDougal,  Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [Mauritz Duwall]</span>  (1603&#150;1655), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Sweden, one of nine sons of the Scot Albert MacDougal (1541&#150;1641) of Mackerston and Ursula Von Stralendorf (<i>d</i>. 1651), one of his three wives from Mecklenburg. Little is known of MacDougal's life before he entered Swedish military service with his brothers, although his social success was typical of the ease with which Scotsmen and their sons became integrated into Swedish society at the time. He was known as Mauritz Duwall in Sweden.<br>
<br>MacDougal first served as an ensign in 1624 in Gustaf Horn's Norrland regiment, and his military career advanced rapidly from then on. He had become a lieutenant in his brother James MacDougal's regiment by 1626, a captain two years later, a lieutenant-colonel by 1633, and a full colonel the following year. In 1638 he was in charge of conscription in the V&auml;sterbotten region of Finland. That year he was also ennobled and introduced into the Swedish house of nobility on the merits of his father's long service to the Swedish crown. His brother Axel had been ennobled in 1626. MacDougal's claims to noble origins were supported by a fellow Scottish officer, James Forbes, and the Swedish chancellor's son, Johan Oxenstierna, who reported upon their return from a diplomatic mission to Scotland in 1634 that the MacDougals were a well-known noble family.<br>
<br>MacDougal became involved in disputes between the dowager queen Kristina, Gustav II Adolf's mother, and the Swedish government in 1640. He felt a strong loyalty towards Kristina as his father had served her before him. Not only had the queen sought financial aid from MacDougal, which was considered an illegal action, but he had also prevented another Swedish noblewoman, Kristina Bielke, from moving into the dowager queen's property in &Ouml;rby. In 1641 MacDougal appeared before the Riksr&aring;d (the Swedish state council) to answer several charges of unlawful and disgraceful behaviour. He defended himself well, was reinstated to his former position, and by 1644 was being considered by the Riksr&aring;d for the position of colonel of the mountain troops. He consolidated his position in Sweden by buying land from his brother Colonel and Commandant Tobias MacDougal in 1652&#151;land which had originally been procured with Gustav II Adolf's permission in 1629. This meant that he held land in Hallkved, Broby, and Sund in Funbo parish, and K&aring;ttslinge in Vendels parish. Little is known of MacDougal's later activities or of his marriage. He died in 1655.<br>
