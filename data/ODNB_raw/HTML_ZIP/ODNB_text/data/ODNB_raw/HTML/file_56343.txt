<span class="headword">Gurney <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Batten]</span>,  Emelia Russell</span>  (1823&#150;1896), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's higher education</span>, was born on 26 July 1823, probably at Harrow, the elder daughter of the Revd Samuel Ellis Batten (1792&#150;1830), assistant master at Harrow School, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Venn (1798&#150;1870), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28188/', "John Venn")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28184/', "Venn, Henry (1725&#150;1797)")</script>]. Batten, &#145;whose gay and buoyant spirits made him the playfellow of his children&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1), died in Emelia's seventh year, and her younger sister, Florence, died in adolescence. After Batten's death the family moved first to Pinner, in London, then to Hereford. They often travelled abroad and were in Italy when Florence died in 1842. As a result of these early losses, Caroline and Emelia became close friends, their intimacy barely disturbed by Emelia's marriage. Nevertheless, Emelia's memories were of a strict evangelical upbringing; she confessed that, for her, Christmas Day had always been &#145;a second Sunday in one week&hellip; when the worldly people (envied creatures!) amused themselves all the more, and without breaking one of the ten commandments either&#146;  (ibid., 62).<br>
<br>On 1 September 1852 Emelia Batten married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11774/', "Russell Gurney (1804&#150;1878)")</script>, a QC nearly twenty years her senior who would later become recorder of London and Conservative MP. It was a successful match; the Gurneys were an affectionate couple with a strong intellectual affinity who shared reforming and religious interests. Shortly after their marriage they moved to 8 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, where they lived until Russell Gurney's death. The Gurneys had no children, but in 1862 they became guardians of the five children of Gurney's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11768/', "John Hampden Gurney")</script>. They took a house for their wards which the family shared for three years. Although the ages of the children made it unnecessary for Russell and Emelia Gurney to live with them continuously, Emelia formed close ties of affection with them.<br>
<br>Emelia Gurney was one of the original members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92488', "Kensington Society")</script>, a debating group for women, and she hosted parties where reformers and feminists could meet. She was known as a woman of great warmth and charm. In 1860, when she was chairing a committee formed by Elizabeth Blackwell to investigate the possibility of opening medical education to women, she was introduced to the young Elizabeth Garrett. The Gurneys helped Garrett take the first steps in her medical education and Emelia became a close friend, advising her on one occasion to use her feminine charms to overcome the hostility of male doctors.<br>
<br>Another friend from the Kensington Society, Emily Davies, who described her as &#145;heavenly&#146;, recruited Emelia to the campaign to admit women to local examinations, and she became one of the &#145;ladylike ladies&#146; working for the cause  (Stephen, 97, 152). She was involved in the establishment of Girton College from its earliest days, participating in the selection of its first site and the formulation of college rules. She approved of the recruitment of George Eliot to the campaign for a women's college, despite some supporters' misgivings about Eliot's personal morality. Emelia Gurney was one of the signatories of the college's articles of association (1872) and was a member of the college from 1872 until her death.<br>
<br>During this period the Gurneys travelled widely, including a trip to Jamaica in 1865, where Russell Gurney served as a commissioner investigating Governor Eyre's response to a recent uprising. She found the scenery beautiful and had some sympathy for the Jamaican people, yet it cannot be said that her appreciation of their culture transcended the prejudices of her time.<br>
<br>Caroline Batten died in 1870; Emelia grieved for her and consoled herself by furnishing a small cottage with mementoes of her mother. In 1871 the Gurneys travelled to Washington, DC, where they were to spend two winters while Russell Gurney acted as commissioner to arbitrate between British and American merchants.<br>
<br>Emelia Gurney's intense spirituality infused all of her work and, as she grew older, absorbed increasing amounts of her attention. In her youth she and her mother derived great spiritual refreshment from visits to Linlathen, home of the Scottish religious thinker Thomas Erskine. After her mother's death Emelia Gurney attended the series of spiritual conferences held at Broadlands, Hampshire, the home of her friends Mr and Mrs Cowper-Temple (later Lord and Lady Mount-Temple), between 1874 and 1888. She was eager to learn from religious teachers and once told her cousin, &#145;I have an intense pleasure in being converted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 143). She became increasingly interested in the mystical aspects of Christian faith, linking it to her appreciation of beauty in nature and in art. Her family believed this freed her from &#145;the oppressive Calvinism of &hellip; her early youth&#146;  (ibid., 142).<br>
<br>Russell Gurney died suddenly in 1878. Emelia immediately moved to a small house in 3 Orme Square, Bayswater, which the Gurneys had established in 1875 as a convalescent home for women recently discharged from hospital. She desperately tried to fill the void with travel, visiting Palestine in 1883 and Sicily in 1889, by nursing both her convalescents and her friends, and with her religious faith.<br>
<br>About 1885 Emelia began reading Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span> for spiritual nourishment and consolation, and in 1893, after a year of illness, she published <span class="italic">Dante's Pilgrim's Progress</span>. She had been negotiating for some time to buy a small piece of land on which to build a chapel in central London in memory of her husband. After many delays the Chapel of the Ascension, described by Cherry and Pevsner as &#145;chaste Italian Quattrocento&#146;, with paintings by the religious artist Frederic Shields, opened early in 1896  (Cherry and Pevsner, 673). At the opening of her long-awaited monument to her faith, Emelia Gurney contracted a chest infection, and, after lingering for seven months, died on 17 October 1896 at her home in Orme Square. The Chapel of the Ascension was little used and was demolished some time after 1950.<br>
