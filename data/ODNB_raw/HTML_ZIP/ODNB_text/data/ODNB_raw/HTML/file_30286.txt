<span class="headword">Young, Sir  William</span>  (1799&#150;1887), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer in Nova Scotia</span>, was born on 8 September 1799 at Falkirk, the son of John Young and his wife, Agnes Renny, the daughter of George Renny of Falkirk. His father <a name="cosubject_30271"></a><span class="headword">John Young</span>  (1773&#150;1837), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on agriculture in Nova Scotia</span>, was born near Falkirk on 1 September 1773, the son of William Young, a merchant, and his wife, Janet. He studied at Glasgow University about 1790 before sailing with his wife, Agnes, and their four children to Halifax in April 1814. The British occupation of Calais, Maine, provided him with a profitable market from September 1814 until April 1815 for goods which he had brought from Scotland. In the economic disarray which followed the war Young decided that there would be public support for agricultural reform, and between 1818 and 1821 he published sixty-four letters in the Halifax <span class="italic">Acadian Recorder</span> under the pen-name Agricola. Of these, thirty-eight were collected and published in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Letters of Agricola on the Principles of Vegetation and Tillage</span>. He advocated improvements in agriculture based on both theoretical scientific knowledge and empirically derived practice. His expectations were realized when a central board of agriculture was established in 1819. Young was named secretary and treasurer, but his desultory performance contributed to the abolition of the board in 1826. He was never an enthusiast for agriculture <i>per se</i>; rather he saw its improvement as a vehicle for his own social elevation. He managed to be elected for Sydney county in 1826 and held this seat until his death, on 6 October 1837, at his home, Willow Park Farm, Halifax.<br>
<br>William Young's career had an early start. He later claimed to have studied at the University of Glasgow before his family emigrated when he was fourteen. When his father was trading in Calais, William acted as his agent in Halifax; he also acted as his father's agent in New York from June until October 1815. In late 1815 he and James Cogswell became partners in an auction and commission business which probably continued until he entered into an indenture of apprenticeship with the legal firm of Charles Rufus and Samuel Prescott Fairbanks. This indenture ended acrimoniously when C. R. Fairbanks in 1823 accused William of having revealed Fairbanks's campaign strategy to John Young, who had unsuccessfully contested a Halifax by-election against him.<br>
<br>Having been admitted to the bar as an attorney in 1825 and as a barrister in 1826, Young established a flourishing private law practice in Halifax. In spite of a poor technical knowledge of law, he was a very effective advocate in the court room. Although he was an adherent to the Church of Scotland, on 30 August 1830 he married Anne (1803/4&#150;1883), the daughter of Michael Tobin, a prominent Irish Roman Catholic merchant in Halifax. They had no children. In 1834 Young established a legal and insurance partnership with his brother George Renny. <a name="cosubject_30263"></a><span class="headword">George Renny Young</span>  (1802&#150;1853), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Nova Scotia</span>, born on 4 July 1802 in Falkirk, was active in his father's commercial business until 1821, when he began his studies at Pictou Academy. When he graduated in late 1824 he began to publish <span class="italic">The Novascotian, or, Colonial Herald</span>; however, he sold this paper to Joseph Howe in December 1827 in order to devote himself to legal studies, principally in Britain. He was admitted to the Nova Scotian bar as an attorney on 22 January 1833 and as a barrister on 22 July 1834. His legal knowledge and capacity for research was superior to that of his brother, and he published eight pamphlets on matters of contemporary public concern, the most notable being <span class="italic">The British North American Colonies</span> (1834). During an extended visit to England in 1837&#150;8 he married Jane, the daughter of Thomas Holdsworth Brooking.<br>
<br>In the 1832 general election William Young was returned for Cape Breton county, only to be unseated by the legislature on the grounds that a riot during the election had been organized by his brother George. William was successful in the 1836 general election as a supporter of the Reform Party, but his reputation for being overly ambitious and engaging in sharp practice meant that he did not advance as rapidly as his talents warranted. Nevertheless, he was part of a delegation of four which held constitutional discussions with Lord Durham at Quebec, and in 1839 he was one of two representatives sent to Britain to argue the case of the assembly before the British government. In 1842 he was appointed to the executive council and in 1844 became speaker of the house.<br>
<br>William Young was joined in the assembly in 1843 by his brother George, who was elected for Pictou, and they subsequently became involved in promoting the Halifax to Quebec railway. Following the 1847 general election George entered the new Reform ministry. However, George's continued support of his own Quebec railway project, rather than the ministry's own scheme, contributed to his breaking with the government in 1851. A further contributing factor was his poor deteriorating physical and mental health. He did not stand for re-election in 1851 and died in Halifax on 30 June 1853.<br>
<br>William Young remained as speaker of the assembly until April 1854, when, partly because there were no other prominent contenders, he became attorney-general and leader of the government. His government was brought down on 18 February 1857 after having alienated Roman Catholics, which was ironic considering that Young represented a riding that had a large Catholic population. In the 1859 general election Young was elected in the protestant county of Cumberland, his party managed to gain a fragile majority in the assembly, and he returned to office as premier in February the following year.<br>
<br>When Chief Justice Haliburton died on 16 July 1860, Young gained the office which he had long wanted. Although he served from August 1860 until 1881, his judgments were not particularly distinguished. Displaying a sense of civic duty, however, he became a generous benefactor to the city and Dalhousie University. In addition to numerous gifts made during his lifetime, he bequeathed $200,000 out of his total estate of $350,000 to a variety of causes. In 1869, perhaps as a reward for his support of confederation, he was awarded a KB. He died in Halifax on 8 May 1887.<br>
<br>Although William Young became both premier and chief justice of Nova Scotia, he did not make a particularly positive contribution to the public life of his time. Moreover, his unrelenting and calculating pursuit of self-interest throughout his public career, similar to that of his father John and his brother George, was frequently disruptive and did nothing to alleviate the highly polemical and partisan nature of politics in this period.<br>
