<span class="headword">Clerke,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1634), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London, the son of George Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1607). He matriculated as a pensioner from Christ's College, Cambridge, in December 1579 and graduated BA in early 1583. Elected that year as a fellow, he proceeded MA in 1586. As a leader of the minority conformist faction in this generally puritan college, in 1590 he came to blows with the strongly Calvinist George Downame, later bishop of Derry. That October, Clerke and a colleague, John Powell, wrote to Lord Burghley complaining that they had not been promoted within Christ's because &#145;we do not favour the party of those who through portents of new opinions and treading down of all laws would attack the jugular of the college&#146;  (Bondos-Greene, 200). Burghley effected a reconciliation in November, but in the fellowship elections of 1596 Clerke, who had proceeded BTh in 1593 and who was that year Lady Margaret preacher, encountered further trouble when he opposed the candidature of Thomas Rainbow, whom he considered a &#145;schismatic&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1597 Clerke was instituted as vicar of Minster, in the island of Thanet, and the following year, having proceeded DTh, he relinquished his fellowship. Within a short time he married; his wife's name is unknown, but a son, Martin, perhaps their eldest child, who graduated from Christ's early in 1621, was probably born before 1602. On 8 May 1602 Clerke was collated to the office of six-preacher in Canterbury Cathedral; regular baptisms and burials of members of his family suggest that from at least early 1605 he was often resident in the city. A learned Hebraist, he was chosen as one of the translators of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and worked on the first section from <span class="roman">Genesis</span> to <span class="roman">Kings</span>. He sufficiently impressed the king to become the latter's apparently preferred candidate to succeed Edmund Barwell (<i>d</i>. 1609) in the mastership of Christ's College, but at the last minute James I ordered the earl of Salisbury to institute Valentine Cary on the stated grounds that Cary was unmarried and childless. Compensation came to Clerke successively in the form of the Kentish rectory of Shargate and vicarage of Monkton with Birchington, which he held with Minster respectively from 1609 to 1611 and from 1611 until his death.<br>
<br>Having given birth to at least ten children, Clerke's wife died, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral on 8 October 1620; most of the children also predeceased their father. Having married again, Clerke died in 1634 and was buried in the cathedral on 29 September. His will gave little to his two &#145;unkinde sonnes&#146;, Martin and James; his daughter Katherine, who was under nineteen, was left to the guardianship of her maternal relatives, including her great-aunt, &#145;the elder Lady Oxinden&#146;. Other beneficiaries included his widow, the hospitals of St John's, Canterbury, and St Nicholas, Harbaldown, the schools of St Paul's, London, and Christ Church, Canterbury, and Christ's College. He also confirmed a deed of 1625 setting aside &pound;120 for loans to farmers at Minster to improve their stock. Seventy-four of his sermons were edited by Charles White and published as <span class="italic">Sermons Preached by that Reverend and Learned Divine Richard Clerke</span> (1637). According to William Prynne's account in his <span class="italic">Canterburies Doome</span> (1646) of the testimony given by White at Archbishop William Laud's trial, Laud's chaplains and licensers made extensive alterations to Clerke's text, purging much of his anti-Catholicism and seeking to give his moderate Calvinism an Arminian gloss. Passages affirming the pope to be Antichrist, attacking the mass, and criticizing monks and clergy were removed, while his restriction of salvation to an elect few was replaced by a doctrine approaching universal grace. However, taken at face value Clerke's collected works still represent not so much full-blown Laudian ceremonialism as &#145;a Whitgiftian (but distinctly pre-Laudian) Conformist churchmanship&#146;  (Collinson, 183). Visitation sermons apart, their message was generally non-controversial, valuing equally prayer, preaching, sacraments, and the decency of actions such as kneeling at communion. Such a message sits reasonably comfortably with the anti-puritanism of his younger days.<br>
