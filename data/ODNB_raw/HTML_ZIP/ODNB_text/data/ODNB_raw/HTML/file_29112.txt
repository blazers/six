<span class="headword">Westfield,  Thomas</span>  (1573&#150;1644), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol</span>, was born in the parish of St Mary's, Ely, Cambridgeshire, the son of William Westfield. After attending the free school there, in 1589 he matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1593, proceeded MA in 1596, held a fellowship from 1599 to 1603, and proceeded BD in 1604 (incorporated at Oxford on 9 July 1611). Between 1600 and 1605 he was apparently rector of South Somercote, Lincolnshire, and vicar of Barton, Cambridgeshire, but he spent most of his long clerical career in the diocese of London. After assisting Nicholas Felton at St Mary-le-Bow, he became rector of St Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (18 December 1605) and of Hornsey (28 April 1615), a living he retained until 1637. His patron at St Bartholomew's was Robert, Lord Rich, and Rich's son the earl of Holland also admired him. Westfield received the prebend of Ealdstreet (12 April 1614) in St Paul's Cathedral, which he exchanged for that of Caddington Major (1 March 1615). Thomas Fuller characterized Westfield as a &#145;contented meek man&#146; because in 1617, having sufficient means for himself, he declined the see of Bristol  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 232). At an unknown date he married his first wife, Ann; she was buried at St Bartholomew's on 11 December 1619.<br>
<br>A theological Calvinist, Westfield was from 1631 to 1632 the first president of Sion College, yet he was also William Laud's choice, on 14 November 1631, for the archdeaconry of St Albans. He continued to steer a moderate path, and to enjoy the confidence of those of different viewpoints. In May 1640 he helped lead a protest against the continuation of the convocation after the dissolution of the Short Parliament, and on 6 August he joined a group of London clergy who signed a petition against the &#145;etcetera oath&#146;. In March 1641 he was among a varied group of clergy named as assistants to the House of Lords committee on innovations in religion but revealed his essential conformity when, in a sermon at St Paul's on 14 November, he defended episcopacy by praising Morton, Buckeridge, Ussher, Davenant, and other bishops of the Church of England whose books against &#145;popery&#146; proved they did not deserve trampling by &#145;the dirty feet of some Sectaries in their scurrilous libels and pamphlets&#146;  (T. Westfield, <span class="italic">Eleven Choice Sermons</span>, 1656, sig. Kk2<i>r</i>). In sermons published much later as <span class="italic">The White Robe</span> (1660), he asked &#145;what offence it will be to God&#146; if clergymen &#145;come to the Lord's Table in their white garments?&#146;  (p. 55), and argued that only kings are &#145;the lord's anointed&#146;  (p. 113). John Walker claimed that Westfield suffered abuse in the streets and sequestration that forced him to flee to Oxford. Here, preaching before the king for the first time, he was so overawed that he fainted, although his preaching &#145;was reckoned powerful and heart-searching&#146;, and Bishop John King said &#145;he was born an Orator&#146;  (Lloyd, 303). On 26 April 1642 he was consecrated bishop of Bristol; none the less, he was approved by the Commons as a member of the assembly of divines on 31 May and was back in London in 1643. On 13 May, the Commons committee for sequestrations praised his &#145;Learning and Merit&#146; and, on the information of the earl of Holland, ordered the tenants on his episcopal lands to cease refusing to pay the rents they owed him. Westfield attended the Westminster assembly's first session on 1 July, the only bishop to do so, but did not return. According to Fuller, &#145;Dr. Westfield and some few others seemed the only nonconformists amongst them, for their conformity whose gowns and canonical habits differed from all the rest&#146;  (Fuller, 6.251).<br>
<br>Westfield died on 28 June 1644 and was buried, as he had wished, in Bristol Cathedral near the tomb of the first bishop of the diocese. He left his estate to his widow and executor, Elisabeth (<i>d</i>. 1653), the daughter of Adolphus Meetkerke of Flanders, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18512/', "Edward Meetkerke")</script>, who was an overseer of his will. They had a son, Edward, who went to Christ Church, Oxford, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who in memory of her father made an anagram of his name: &#145;Thomas Westfield&#151;I dwell the most safe&#146;  (Lloyd, 304).<br>
