<span class="headword">McDonald,  Allan</span>  (1859&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and folklorist</span>, son of John McDonald and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacPherson, was born at Kilmallie, on the borders of Argyll and Inverness-shire, on 25 October 1859. He was educated at Blairs College, Kincardineshire, and at the Colegio Real de los Escoceses, at Valladolid, Spain. He was ordained by Archbishop Eyre at St Andrews Cathedral in the summer of 1882. He was then appointed to the Oban mission under Bishop Angus MacDonald, and in 1884 became parish priest of Dalibrog with Eriskay in South Uist, an almost wholly Gaelic-speaking community, where he perfected his knowledge of the Gaelic language and of its South Uist dialect in which most of his writing was done.<br>
<br>Probably encouraged by the Revd Alexander Campbell, a priest born in South Uist about 1819, McDonald began in 1887 to note down local traditions, songs, proverbs, and customs, often giving the actual Gaelic words of his respondents. By December 1892, well before the folklorist movement showed an interest in the Hebrides, he had filled two large notebooks. By 1900 he had amassed a substantial collection, which included examples of second sight, Gaelic hymns, and his poetry. He published a collection of Gaelic hymns for children in 1889 and a larger collection in 1893. His reputation spread beyond the Hebrides and in 1895, soon after his health had broken down and his duties had been confined to the island of Eriskay, he was visited by Ada Goodrich Freer in connection with the Society for Psychical Research's inquiry into second sight. The inquiry came to little, but Freer returned with abundant literary and folklore material, which she soon began to publish. She did this with McDonald's perhaps na&iuml;ve permission and she acknowledged his help, but she gave the impression that McDonald was little more than her assistant and that some of his material had in fact been collected by her. The extent of her reliance on McDonald later became apparent. McDonald was visited by several folklorists including, in the summer of 1905, Marjory Kennedy-Fraser, whom he also generously helped.<br>
<br>McDonald was active in South Uist affairs and was briefly a member of Inverness-shire county council. He built a new church on Eriskay in 1903, financed by the sale of his manuscripts to Walter Blackie, the publisher. He was dean of the Isles, and died of pneumonia on 8 October 1905 on Eriskay, where he was buried.<br>
<br>After McDonald's death his notebooks and papers were dispersed, and by the 1920s were thought completely lost. However, from 1947 this contributor, with the help of friends, was able to trace many of them and they are now chiefly in the Carmichael MSS in Edinburgh University Library and in the Henderson MSS in Glasgow University Library. McDonald's role in the timely collection of a fast-vanishing Hebridean folklore cannot be too strongly emphasized.<br>
