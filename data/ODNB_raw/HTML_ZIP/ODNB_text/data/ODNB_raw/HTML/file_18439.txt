</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maynard, Sir  John</span>  (1604&#150;1690), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 18 July 1604 at the Abbey House in Tavistock, Devon, eldest son of Alexander Maynard (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1567) and Honora, daughter of Arthur Arscott of Tetcott, Devon. Maynard followed his father's profession and entered his father's inn, the Middle Temple, after taking his BA from Exeter College, Oxford, on 25 April 1621. He came to the bar in 1626 and became a bencher of his inn in 1648.<br>
<br>Maynard married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1654/1655), daughter of Andrew Henley of Taunton, by 1631, by which time he was well advanced in his legal career. He first appears in the records and reports of the courts at Westminster Hall in 1628, where he continued to plead in the 1630s, aided in part by the patronage of Attorney-General Sir William Noy. He represented Totnes in both parliaments seated in 1640. Throughout the controversies of that decade Maynard remained close to his native county. Plymouth made him their recorder in 1640, as did Totnes in 1645, and he served in various county commissions during those years. But it was at Westminster that he made his name. Maynard, with John Glynn and his old friend Bulstrode Whitelocke, served as counsel prosecuting the earl of Strafford in parliament in 1641. Maynard later played the same role in the impeachment of Archbishop William Laud. Though he helped to destroy the king's servants, as late as Hilary term 1642 Maynard continued to present briefs for the crown in king's bench, as he had done for years.<br>
<br>In parliament Maynard actively engaged in the regulation of the church, reporting the work of a committee in 1641 to examine irregularly composed church canons. In the debate on the grand remonstrance later that year, Maynard spoke in favour of requiring privy councillors to receive parliamentary approval. Maynard remained at Westminster throughout the civil war. He participated in the Westminster assembly of divines and took the covenant. His commitment to presbytery and his willingness to work with the Scots put him in league with those who sought a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In February 1648 Maynard argued that parliament's decision to make no more addresses to the king in effect dissolved the parliament. He then withdrew from parliament and remained at a distance during the trial and execution of the king.<br>
<br>Maynard may have withdrawn from Westminster Hall as well during the second half of 1648 and early 1649: he made no appearances in king's bench, in which he had pleaded often during the previous twenty years. But he took the engagement to the Commonwealth, returned to his lucrative practice, and maintained an active public presence. In December 1650 Maynard was one of the principal defenders of the corporation of London against the Leveller Major John Wildman, who argued that the City's government should be re-established by popular assent. Maynard condemned &#145;popularity&#146;: &#145;certainly the experience of all generations in the world evidences this truth, that there may be just subjection without assent&#146;  (<span class="italic">London's Liberties</span>, 13). Perhaps this helps explain Maynard's initial reluctance to provide counsel to John Lilburne in 1653. When he at last did so, he helped Lilburne undermine the indictment against him. Much of Maynard's legal work in the 1640s and 1650s came on writs of habeas corpus and mandamus, related devices used to constrain the actions of lesser courts and administrative officers. Having pleaded numerous times in habeas corpus cases since the 1630s, the conflicts of civil war and interregnum created only more chances for Maynard to do so. In 1655 Maynard argued the habeas corpus for a London merchant imprisoned by the council of state for refusing to pay a duty. Maynard and his co-counsel were committed when they argued that the duty was illegal; they were soon released after making their submission to the council. Maynard played an even more important role in cases on mandamus, by which people purged from local office during the recent turmoil could win back their places. In 1643 he used the writ to try to regain a schoolmaster's lost place, and in 1647 he argued successfully for the restoration of two London common councilmen.<h2>
<a name="Supportformonarchy"></a>Support for monarchy</h2>According to Bishop Burnet, Maynard had become one of a handful of prominent lawyers desiring a restoration of monarchy as early as the mid-1650s. In 1656 Maynard was chosen to parliament for Plymouth, though he was not allowed to sit. Otherwise he continued to enjoy preferment. In 1654 he was made serjeant-at-law, and in May 1658 he became a protector's serjeant. In 1659 he was again chosen as a member of parliament, for Newtown, Isle of Wight. Maynard prospered during the 1650s: by 1654 he had purchased the manor of Bere Ferrers, between Plymouth and Tavistock, from the royalist earl of Newport. His wife died around this time, but by 1658 he was building a new house at Gunnersbury, Middlesex, on a property once belonging to the bishop of London. This project may well have been connected to his second marriage, in February 1657, to a Kent widow, Jane Selhurst. Maynard would marry twice more after her death in early 1668. Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of Edward, Lord Gorges and twice widowed herself, became his third wife by 1671. Mary Upton (<i>d</i>. 1721), daughter of a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and widow of Dr Charles Vermuyden, married Maynard on 2 June 1680. Maynard had seven children with his first wife, though no children followed from his later marriages.<br>
<br>Both Plymouth and Exeter chose Maynard for the Convention of 1660, though he ultimately sat for Exeter. Like many, Maynard was ready to do everything possible to help the nation forget the preceding two decades. The Commons asked Maynard and William Prynne to see that all orders relating to the engagement were expunged. Maynard sat on the committee charged with promoting Charles II's tolerationist declaration of Breda and on another that prepared the bill for continuing judicial proceedings; he took the lead in preparing the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span> and helped to draft the acceptance of the king's pardon. The king too seemed ready to forget recent events; among other acts of forgiveness, he again made Maynard a serjeant-at-law. In November 1660 Charles knighted him and promoted him to king's serjeant.<br>
<br>In 1661 Maynard was seated for Bere Alston, his own pocket borough given his ownership of the manor of Bere Ferrers. He chaired or sat on numerous committees, especially those concerned with proposed changes to the law. He thus assisted with an unsuccessful bill for setting up a land registry and another concerning delays in legal process. In December 1666 Maynard served on the committee that drew up the charges on which Lord Mordaunt was impeached, and he helped to manage the conference with the Lords on the same matter. Maynard took the other side in the impeachment of the earl of Clarendon in 1667, and made a valiant attempt to fend off his attackers: &#145;where life is concerned, you ought to have a moral certainty of the thing&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 6.330). Saying this in a proceeding so like the impeachments of Strafford and Laud must have started tongues to wag against the now venerable lawyer.<br>
<br>Maynard was widely seen as a supporter of the crown throughout the 1660s, particularly in matters affecting royal revenues. The privy council and royal officers turned to him for legal advice and for help mediating disputes. As a king's serjeant, Maynard pleaded often for the king as he continued his practice as one of the leaders in the courts at Westminster. He maintained his prominence in arguments on mandamus, including those used in efforts to restore dismissed university fellows, cases that proved crucial for defining king's bench's purview on the writ. Similarly, Maynard presented the king's case in a 1663 mandamus sent to the New River Water Company, successfully contending that a dismissed company officer should have the writ because expulsions from companies with royal charters &#145;concerned the king&#146;  (1 Levinz 123, 83 ER 329). Maynard premised his arguments on the idea that the king should superintend the conduct of all lesser authorities; acting through this court and using these writs, the king protected his subjects' liberties and privileges. Maynard applied much the same reasoning in 1668 during the Commons' dispute with the House of Lords in the case of <i>Thomas Skinner v. the East India Company</i>. When the Lords heard the matter and found for Skinner, the Commons complained that the Lords had exceeded their jurisdiction. As Maynard explained at a conference with the Lords, &#145;all justice flows from his Majesty&#146;  (Hart, 246). Conflict between the two houses continued until the king intervened, ordering the proceedings of both houses to be erased from their journals.<br>
<br>Among those who had been imprisoned and fined by order of the Lords in <i>Skinner's case</i> was Sir Samuel Barnardiston, the company's deputy governor. In 1674 Maynard served as one of Barnardiston's counsel against Sir William Soame, who as sheriff of Suffolk in 1674 had, according to Barnardiston, wrongly made a double return in his contest for a parliamentary seat. This was another crucial test of the Commons' privilege to decide disputed elections. Maynard now took the other side, arguing that this was not properly a parliamentary matter since the events in question occurred outside the house. More important was the legal device Maynard employed: an action on the case for a false return, the same device used in testing the propriety of returns to writs of mandamus. Maynard admitted in court that this was a novel way to proceed, but successfully argued that only with this most flexible of procedural instruments could one have a wrong righted when it involved circumstances that were new to the law. The decision went for Barnardiston, though it was later reversed in exchequer chamber when it was presided over by Sir Francis North, who had earlier represented Soame. In 1679 Maynard would serve on a committee charged to propose electoral reform and to consider a parliamentary reversal of the judgment in <i>Barnardiston's case</i>.<h2>
<a name="Lawinparliament"></a>Law in parliament</h2>As one of the kingdom's most important lawyers, Maynard consistently took centre stage in parliamentary discussions of changes to the workings of the law. Thus he sat with other prominent lawyers on a committee appointed in February 1677 to consider the inroads made by courts of equity on common law jurisdiction. Perhaps owing to his experience arguing writs of habeas corpus, he was also among those charged in 1668 and again in the mid-1670s with preparing a bill to improve the writ's effectiveness. On the other hand, in 1670 Maynard had argued unsuccessfully for the king in <i>Bushell's case</i> that habeas corpus might not be used to free jurors imprisoned for returning a verdict against the evidence. And for Maynard, the writ did not extend to the inspection of commitments by parliament. Thus when the earl of Shaftesbury was imprisoned by the House of Lords in 1677, it was Maynard who argued against his release. Astonishingly&#151;given his contentions in <i>Skinner's case</i>&#151;Maynard contended in <i>Shaftesbury's case</i> &#145;that the House of Lords is the supreme court of the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 6.1290); thus the writ could not run from king's bench to a superior court. Maynard's view now prevailed. Despite these courtroom appearances in which he argued to limit the writ, Maynard proved one of the central figures when the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Act</span>&#151;which dramatically expanded the writ's ambit&#151;finally passed in 1679.<br>
<br>Maynard served for Plymouth in the parliaments of 1679&#150;81, where he eagerly joined his Commons colleagues in believing the tales of a &#145;popish plot&#146;. Depending largely on the evidence of Titus Oates, Maynard prosecuted Edward Coleman; he participated in other trials of accused plotters throughout 1679 to destroy what he called the &#145;abominable conspiracy against the king, the nation, the religion, and the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 7.768). He also helped to manage the Commons' evidence against Viscount Stafford. Many sympathetically noted Stafford's advanced age, suspecting that this explained why he was the first of the five &#145;popish lords&#146; to be tried in parliament. But Maynard, his prosecutor, was ten years older; he could look back now on a lengthy career in parliamentary impeachments. In 1667, while defending Clarendon, Maynard had argued that &#145;when a case comes that is the sheet-anchor of life, and estate, you should be wary; for by wit and oratory that may be made treason which is not&#146;  (ibid., 6.345). But with the attack on Stafford and on the earl of Danby, Maynard argued for a dramatically expanded reading of the law of treason; he later served on the committee which drew up the articles for Danby's impeachment. Likewise, Maynard justified impeaching Chief Justice Sir William Scroggs by broadening treason to include anything the Commons might choose: &#145;Whatever offence deserves the punishment of a traitor, the Parliament may impeach&#146;  (ibid., 8.202).<br>
<br>Maynard also argued for impeaching Edward Fitzharris. When the House of Lords refused to try him, Maynard insisted that this was a breach of the Commons' privilege to impeach. None the less, Maynard joined the team of prosecutors once Fitzharris was brought for trial in king's bench. Fitzharris pleaded against king's bench's jurisdiction, claiming that an impeachment still pended against him in parliament, thus barring process in a lesser court. Ironically Maynard, who had previously defended parliament's jurisdiction, now tossed Fitzharris's complaint aside. After convincing the court that it could proceed to trial, Maynard then helped manage the evidence which ultimately produced Fitzharris's execution for treason.<br>
<br>Maynard joined in some of the other prosecutions of plotters and libellers of the early 1680s, but, given his prominence in court and Commons, Maynard slipped surprisingly far from view in the years after 1682. He played no part in formulating London's defence against the <i>quo warranto</i> adjudged against the City in 1683, though in 1684 he advised Plymouth against giving up its charter when threatened by a <i>quo warranto</i>, saying that the charter was &#145;a trust that could not be surrendered&#146;  (M. Landon, <span class="italic">The Triumph of the Lawyers</span>, 1970, 128). He thus promoted a view that had been demolished by the London judgment, a view that would not be revived after 1688, and one Maynard himself had condemned in his 1650 debate with John Wildman when he observed that &#145;no doubt but there is forfeiture of charters&#146;  (<span class="italic">London's Liberties</span>, 38). Maynard lost his recorderships when Plymouth and Totnes received new charters in 1684, and he fared worse in the next reign when he was put out of the many county commissions of the peace on which he had served. But Maynard sat for Bere Alston in James II's parliament, where he opposed the grant of supply on grounds that it might be used to build a royal army officered by Catholics.<br>
<br>In October 1688 Maynard was one of the legal luminaries appointed to the special commission for investigating the birth of the prince of Wales. In December the provisional government consulted Maynard about how to proceed in the king's absence; later he helped to draw up the address of thanks to the prince of Orange. Maynard represented Plymouth in the convention in 1689 and again in the parliament convened in 1690. Though in 1650 he had argued that &#145;to say that no man nor people shall be governed but by assent, we deny&#146;  (<span class="italic">London's Liberties</span>, 13), he now provided a remarkably contractarian explanation of the meaning of James II's departure.<blockquote>I am of opinion that the King has deposed himself. &hellip; All government had at first its foundation from a pact with the people: &amp; here no one can say but that pact has apparently been broken by the king's invading and violating our laws, property, liberty, and religion. (Lewis Jones, 242)</blockquote>In the weeks following Maynard helped draft the declaration of rights and supported further restrictions against Catholics. As one of England's most eminent and long-lived lawyers, Maynard was appointed with two others in February 1689 to serve as commissioner of the great seal, a post he retained until late May 1690. By September of that year, Maynard was reportedly on his deathbed. He died on 8 October 1690 at his magnificent home at Gunnersbury, in Ealing parish, where he was buried on 25 October. Having survived nearly all his family, Maynard left his property to his grandchildren in a will so tangled by the remainders he appointed that it required a private act of parliament and litigation to unravel.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Maynard demonstrated strong presbyterian commitments throughout the 1640s and 1650s. Though he later moderated these tendencies, he employed at least three chaplains ejected from their livings after 1660, gave financial support to other nonconformist clergy, and permitted them to preach in Tavistock Abbey, whose lease he held. But Maynard might be best characterized as an Anglican who retained dissenting sympathies. By at least 1680, his views were even more clearly of a conforming variety. In the debate on a bill for uniting protestants in December 1680, Maynard spoke eloquently against the dangers of permitting innovations in liturgy or in clerical vestments. But Maynard continued to promote the acceptance of presbyterian methods of ordination. He also favoured elimination of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and the requirement that urban office-holders subscribe the declaration against the covenant, which oaths and subscription Maynard himself would have performed in order to retain his various local offices. As one Devon cleric noted, he &#145;never failed to conform to all things required of him in public, as oaths and tests&#146;  (Croissette).<br>
<br>The dissenter Roger Morrice thought Maynard &#145;the greatest lawyer in England&#146;  (Lacey, 423), and many agreed. Roger North suspected Maynard of presbyterian loyalties, calling him &#145;an anti-restoration lawyer &hellip; true as steel to the principles of the late times&#146;  (North, 1.237); but North also admired him for his professional ability, calling him &#145;the best old book-lawyer of his time&#146;  (ibid., 27). A constant reader of yearbooks, Maynard gathered an impressive collection of manuscript law reports and readings which was deposited in Lincoln's Inn; he edited a large body of yearbook reports, which he published in 1678. For one of his learning and ability, it is remarkable that he reached the bench only when he was in his eighties. Presiding in chancery as one of the great seal commissioners for just over a year, Maynard's time there was too brief to have any effect on that court's doctrine and practice.<br>
<br>As Maynard noted, &#145;laws are edged tools; those that understand them, make good use of them; and those that do not understand them, will find that they are sharp, and will cut&#146;  (<span class="italic">London's Liberties</span>, 14). One area of the law Maynard understood better than anyone concerned impeachments. From Strafford's trial to Stafford's, there was not a significant impeachment in which Maynard was not directly, and controversially, involved. One of his last recorded speeches in the Commons, in 1689, concerned his opposition to the impeachment of Sir Adam Blair for publishing a paper proclaiming James II. Perhaps for his support of the Commons' power to impeach and for his charity to nonconformists, Maynard is often labelled a whig. But though he felt sympathy for dissent and bigotry against Catholics, his support of monarchy was just as clear. Maynard saw the king standing at the heart of the law he knew so well. Thus he could join with notable supporters of the prerogative such as Sir George Jeffreys and Sir Robert Sawyer in some of the major prosecutions of the 1680s. In 1673 he spoke in parliament in support of the king's power to dispense with statutes, if not to suspend them altogether, and in 1667 he made the strongest defence of the king's embattled minister the earl of Clarendon. Thus Maynard rejected simplistic juxtapositions of &#145;the king's prerogative and the people's liberty&#146;, and was always more suspicious of the latter than he was of the former  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>).<br>
