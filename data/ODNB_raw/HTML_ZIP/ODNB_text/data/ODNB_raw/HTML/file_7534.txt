<span class="headword">Dermody,  Thomas</span>  (1775&#150;1802), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Ennis, co. Clare, on 15 January 1775, the eldest of the three sons of Nicholas Dermody, himself the sixth son of a wealthy farmer. Nicholas Dermody was a bright but alcoholic rural schoolmaster, and Dermody revealed himself to be his father's son, showing a precocious talent for drinking, poetry, and scholarship. A child prodigy, he learned Latin and Greek from the age of four, and was employed as classical assistant in his father's school at the age of nine.<br>
<br>At the age of fifteen, inspired by his reading of <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span>, Dermody resolved to seek his fortune, and ran away to Dublin. Penniless on arrival, he initially accepted employment from a bookstall keeper, who discovered him reading Anacreon. Word about his poetic gifts and classical ability soon spread, and he won the patronage of various civic dignitaries and aristocrats, including Henry Grattan, Lady Moira, who convened a well-known literary salon, and the translator and anthologist Charlotte Brooke. In 1792 a small volume of his poems was published at the expense of one of his patrons, the Revd Gilbert Austin. Dermody went on to publish two more volumes, some critical essays, and, inspired by events in France in 1793, a pamphlet on the revolution.<br>
<br>Increasingly concerned about Dermody's behaviour, defiantly articulated in his poetic declarations such as &#145;I am vicious because I like it&#146;, his patrons consigned him for a brief spell to the guardianship of a priest in Killeigh, but to little avail. Dermody remained a committed and unrepentant drinker, pawning his clothes, being collared by the watch, and increasingly resembling a vagrant. His patrons finally abandoned him to his fate when he refused a scholarship at Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Having nearly been press-ganged into the army on two previous occasions, Dermody had little choice but to enlist voluntarily in the 108th regiment as a private, and, benefiting from the strict regime, obtained a commission in the wagon corps, having served with distinction in France. Later wounded and living on half pay in London, Dermody however quickly returned to drinking, finally dying in poverty in a hovel near Sydenham, Kent, on 15 July 1802, aged twenty-seven. He was buried in Lewisham churchyard which contains a monument to his memory. James Grant Raymond published a biography in 1807, containing all of Dermody's poems. Dermody's allusive, occasionally brilliant satiric verse has often been reprinted and anthologized, even well into the twentieth century. For instance, two of his most famous poems, &#145;An Ode to Myself&#146; and &#145;John Baynam's Epitaph&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing</span> (1991).<br>
