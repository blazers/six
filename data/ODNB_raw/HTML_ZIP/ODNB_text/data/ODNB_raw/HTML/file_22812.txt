<span class="headword">Prinsep,  James</span>  (1799&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Indologist and scientist</span>, was born on 20 August 1799 at 147 Leadenhall Street, London, the seventh son and tenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65458/', "John Prinsep (1746&#150;1830)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22811/', "Prinsep, Henry Thoby (1792&#150;1878)")</script>], merchant and MP, and his wife, Sophia Elizabeth Auriol (1760&#150;1850). John Prinsep went penniless to India in 1771. He was successful as an indigo planter and entrepreneur, and returned to England in 1787 with a fortune of &pound;40,000. He established himself in the City in 1793 as a general merchant and India agent, but business losses and the expenses of contested elections and of his large family (eight surviving sons and three daughters) caused him to move to Clifton, Bristol, in 1809. Prinsep's connections, however, secured places for his sons: all but one made their careers in India. They included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22810/', "Charles Robert Prinsep")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22811/', "Prinsep, Henry Thoby")</script>], economist and advocate-general of Bengal, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22811/', "Henry Thoby Prinsep")</script>, a civil servant and commentator on Indian affairs, whose son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35615/', "Valentine Cameron Prinsep")</script>, was a noted painter.<br>
<br>James Prinsep's only formal early education was two years at the school of a Mr Bullock in Clifton. He was educated mostly at home, with help from his talented siblings. He excelled from an early age at drawing, music, and mechanical invention. Such skills destined him for architecture but a temporary weakness of the eyes developed and his father therefore sought for him an opening in the assay department of the government of India. After studying chemistry at Guy's Hospital and assaying at the Royal Mint in London (1818&#150;19), Prinsep was appointed assistant assay master at the Calcutta mint and arrived in Calcutta on 15 September 1819. Within a year he had been sent by the assay master, Horace Hayman Wilson, to be assay master at the Benares mint, where he remained until its abolition in 1830. He returned to Calcutta as deputy assay master, and upon Wilson's resignation in 1832 he was (despite Wilson's favouring his own prot&eacute;g&eacute; James Atkinson) appointed to succeed him at the newly built Greek revival mint on the Strand with its adjacent house for the assay master. He married in the cathedral of Calcutta on 25 April 1835 Harriet Sophia Aubert, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Jeremiah Aubert and his wife, Hannah. There was only one surviving child, a daughter, Eliza, born in 1837.<br>
<br>Prinsep's early death prompted many eulogies from his contemporaries. He was one of the &#145;most talented and useful&#146; Englishmen ever to work in India  (Malconer, <span class="italic">Colonial Magazine</span>, December 1840).<blockquote>Of his intellectual character, the most prominent feature was enthusiasm, a burning, irrepressible enthusiasm, to which nothing could set bounds [which led him] to apply his powers to a greater range of subjects than any human mind can master or excel in. To this enthusiasm was fortunately united a habitude of order, and power of generalization, which enabled him to grasp and comprehend the greatest variety of details. (ibid.)</blockquote>His official duties as assay master drew him first to scientific research, and to the means for more accurate measurement of very high temperatures. He invented the first practical pyrometer utilizing the expansion of gases for such measurements; his research was communicated to the Royal Society in London and published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1828. He was shortly afterwards elected FRS. In Calcutta he organized the reform of Indian weights and measures in 1833, and advocated the introduction of a uniform coinage based on a new, East India Company's, silver rupee. This was introduced in 1835.<br>
<br>Prinsep's major contributions, however, fell outside his official duties. His enthusiasm for the communication of scientific knowledge led him to collaborate with Major James Herbert in a new monthly journal <span class="italic">Gleanings in Science</span> in 1829. He was himself a principal contributor, and became sole editor in 1831. In 1832 he succeeded Wilson also as secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and he brought new vigour to the society's meetings and publications. In the same year he became editor of a new monthly title, <span class="italic">The Journal of the Asiatic Society</span>, which absorbed the earlier <span class="italic">Gleanings</span>. To this new journal Prinsep contributed articles on chemistry and mineralogy, and above all on Indian antiquities, into the study of which he now wholeheartedly threw himself.<br>
<br>As a result of both his own labours and his encouragement of others, Prinsep's seven years as editor of the <span class="italic">Journal</span> was one of the most fruitful periods of ancient Indian studies. Coins and copies of inscriptions were transmitted to him from all over India, to be deciphered, translated, and published. He reduced to order the complex dynasties and dating systems of pre-Islamic India. His <span class="italic">Useful Tables</span>, published in 1834, stands as a monument to his labours in this field. Prinsep's greatest achievement was to decipher the hitherto unreadable scripts of the most ancient of Indian inscriptions: the results were published in a series of papers in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> in 1837&#150;8. These scripts were the Brahmi used on the pillars at Delhi and Allahabad and on rock inscriptions from both sides of India, and also the Kharosthi script in the coins and inscriptions of the north-west. He demonstrated that the pillar and rock inscriptions were put up by the emperor Asoka Maurya, whose dates could be approximately fixed through his references to contemporary kings of western Asia in the third century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. They allowed the first verified correlation of Indian history and archaeology with those of the Western world. In consequence of these discoveries Prinsep was elected a corresponding member of many of the learned societies of Europe.<br>
<br>Both in <span class="italic">Gleanings in Science</span> and in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> Prinsep undertook much of the drawing and lithography of the accompanying plates. In 1822 he had applied his talents in draughtsmanship to a thorough survey of Benares. A complete map at 8 inches to the mile was prepared, and lithographed in England. A series of exquisite watercolours of the monuments and festivals of Benares was sent to London in 1829 to be lithographed. These were published in Calcutta and London between 1830 and 1834 as <span class="italic">Benares Illustrated, in a Series of Drawings</span>. Nor did he confine his interest in Benares to recording it: he designed and built several public buildings. He improved the sanitation of Benares by constructing underneath the most densely populated part of the city an arched tunnel down to the river, thereby draining various stagnant lakes and pools. The high and graceful minarets of Aurangzeb's mosque were in danger of collapse, so he had them taken down and rebuilt. And so that pilgrims approaching Benares by road from the east should not have to set foot in the polluting waters of the River Karamnasa, he built a stone bridge over this stream of ill repute. In Calcutta one of his first duties, self-imposed but accepted by government, was to complete his brother Thomas's canal linking the River Hooghly at Calcutta with more easterly branches of the Ganges, work on which had been interrupted by his brother's sudden death in 1830.<br>
<br>He was a man who had to fill every waking moment with intense activity. Victor Jacquemont calls him &#145;the wittiest man in India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters from India</span>, 1834, 1.166) and describes him in Benares devoting his mornings to his own manifold projects, his days to work at the mint, and his evenings to musical entertainments  (Jacquemont, <span class="italic">Voyage dans l'Inde</span>, 1.341&#150;5). From the recollections of his brother William he emerges as a charming and gracious individual who &#145;carried everything we did together to perfection, whether in writing, drawing, music or invention of any kind&#146;  (W. Prinsep, 1.126). His enthusiasm emerges from his memorial bust, executed with William's help, with its round, open, and generous face, and wild tufts of hair emerging from the crown.<br>
<br>The heavy labours to which Prinsep subjected himself began to tell on his health, and in 1838 he fell severely ill. He suffered from recurrent headaches and sickness, and eventually from a deterioration in mental functioning. A sea voyage to England afforded no relief. He arrived in England in a very poor condition which did not improve. He died in London on 22 April 1840 in the house of his sister Sophia Haldimand, at 31 Belgrave Square. The news of his death was greeted with the greatest dismay in Calcutta, and subscriptions for memorials immediately opened among both the European and Indian communities. The former commissioned a bust from Francis Chantrey, finished by Henry Weekes, for the Asiatic Society's rooms in Calcutta; the latter subscribed to an elegant Palladian porch on the river, built by W. Fitzgerald in 1843 and still known as Prinsep's Ghat.<br>
