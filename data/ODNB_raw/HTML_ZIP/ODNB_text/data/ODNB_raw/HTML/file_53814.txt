<span class="headword">Clark,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> 1859), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was baptized on 5 February 1775 at St Peter's, Canterbury, the son of William Clark (<i>b</i>. 1745/6?) and his wife, Mary Quested (1738?&#150;1794). They lived at 35 St Georges Street, Canterbury, where William, a cordwainer, made and sold boots. Thomas was apprenticed to his father, and in 1796 he was made a freeman of Canterbury. His schooling is unrecorded but anecdotal stories suggest that his musical education began early, as his father directed the Wesleyan Methodist choir, and the chapel orchestra, which included a serpent played by his uncle, practised in the room below his bedroom. According to Harvey, Clark was also interested in bellringing, and he was encouraged to compose by the Francis family, and in particular by John Francis, headmaster at Shepherds House boarding-school, Cranbrook, where a choir of forty boys performed Clark's music.<br>
<br>Although Clark had probably been composing for many years beforehand, his first collection, <span class="italic">A Sett of Psalm and Hymn Tunes with some Select Pieces and an Anthem</span>, was not published until 1805. From then onwards his output was prolific: a further eleven sets had appeared by 1821, although no copy of the tenth now apparently survives. Other important publications included compilations of music for Sunday schools, and nine sets of psalm tunes, which also contained anthems and Anglican service music and which were specifically &#145;adapted for the use of country choirs&#146; with &#145;symphonies&#146;  (in the words used on the title-pages of the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth collections)&#151;short instrumental interludes for the string and/or wind instruments that often accompanied the singing in rural churches without organs.<br>
<br>Clark married Ann Ledger on 1 November 1806 at St George's, Canterbury. He never became a full-time professional musician but continued to combine shoemaking with composing and choir training. It is presumed that he directed the Wesleyan Methodist choir at the St Peter's Street Chapel for nearly thirty years, although there is no record of his appointment. A new leader of the singers was engaged in 1841, and Lightwood states that Clark had to resign the post as he was suspected of holding Unitarian beliefs. He may then have trained the choir of the General Baptists, who worshipped at the dilapidated Blackfriars monastery and who tended towards Unitarianism, but it is unclear whether he actually joined this society.<br>
<br>Like many other provincial church music composers of his day, Clark was influenced by Handel, and he always remembered the powerful effect of hearing <span class="italic">Messiah</span> on a visit to London with his father. His compositions are well written with good tunes and rhythmic vitality, and he deserves to be more widely remembered; but provincial composers, however capable, rarely became famous. As John Fawcett of Bolton, a contemporary of Clark's, who also combined shoemaking with composing, wrote:<blockquote>Never reject a good composition, on the ground of its not having a great author's name attached to it. A few years ago a musical gentleman in London informed me that a certain piece of music, composed by Mr Clark, was laid before, perhaps, the best organist in London. The organist, on examining the composition, and seeing the name Clark attached to it, began to play it, observing it was an excellent composition, and spoke highly of the abilities of Dr Clark, as a composer; but when he was informed that it was the composition of Clark, the shoemaker, of Canterbury, the bigoted organist immediately laid it down, as unworthy of being played through. If the composition be really good receive it; but if it be false, or dry and tasteless, reject it, whoever be the composer. (Fawcett, 43)</blockquote>Today Clark's reputation rests on only one tune, &#145;Cranbrook&#146;, originally set to &#145;Grace 'tis a charming sound&#146; in his first <span class="italic">Sett</span> and now sung to the Yorkshire words &#145;On Ilkla Moor baht 'at&#146;. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries nonconformist composers adapted secular music to sacred texts, but &#145;Cranbrook&#146; is a rare example of a sacred-to-secular parody. This adaptation is usually credited to the conductor of the Heptonstall glee club and was apparently first sung at a concert in 1877, but it has also been suggested that it was extemporized during an outing of the same club to Ilkley Moor in 1886. In the north of England &#145;Cranbrook&#146; remained popular as an alternative tune to &#145;While shepherds watched their flocks by night&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas Clark died on 30 May 1859 in Canterbury, probably at his home in Stour Street, and, presumably because of his Unitarian beliefs, was buried in the unconsecrated part of Wincheap burial-ground, Canterbury, on 3 June 1859.<blockquote>His dedicated skill produced worthy boots and shoes for the people of East Kent, while his intellect was continually used to make not only his neighbours, but people in many countries, including America, sing as they had never done before. (Harvey, 39)</blockquote>
