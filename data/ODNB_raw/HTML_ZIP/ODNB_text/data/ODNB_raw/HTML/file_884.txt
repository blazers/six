<span class="headword">Atwood,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1712), <span class="occ">lawyer and writer on politics</span>, son of John Atwood, of Broomfield, Essex, was admitted as a pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 23 March 1669. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 2 December 1669 and at Gray's Inn on 11 June 1670. Atwood was master of the revels at Gray's Inn (1674&#150;5), became a barrister in 1674 and an ancient in 1701. During his time at Gray's Inn, Atwood became acquainted with William Petyt, a rising whig barrister, who encouraged Atwood to study England's constitutional history. Atwood became highly proficient in early English law and administration and, like Petyt, used his knowledge of English history and law to uphold the rights of parliament and promote England's ancient constitution. In the early 1680s he published several anonymous pamphlets attacking the works of Sir Robert Filmer and the staunch tory ideologue Dr Robert Brady, whose sole purpose, asserted Atwood, was to &#145;purge the body politick from the chronical [<i>sic</i>] disease of liberty and oppressing load of property&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jus Anglorum ab antiquo</span>, 1681, 2).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1683 Atwood came to the defence of the whig divine the Revd Samuel Johnson. Of the many tory replies to Johnson's antipapist, pro-exclusion tract, <span class="italic">Julian the Apostate</span>, the Revd George Hickes's <span class="italic">Jovian, or, An Answer to Julian the Apostate</span> was seen as the strongest. Hickes refuted the efficacy of Johnson's story of the apostasy of Julian and set forth an extreme Filmerian political statement in which he declared that kings alone made law and that the succession was divine and unalterable. In <span class="italic">A Letter of Remarks upon Jovian</span> Atwood defended Johnson's tale of early Christian resistance to the apostate Roman emperor. He asserted that any examination of the original customs and constitution of the English government proved that the succession was always alterable and that law making required the consent of the people. Although Atwood proclaimed himself a loyal son of the church in <span class="italic">A Seasonable Vindication of the Truly Catholic Doctrine of the Church of England</span> (1683), he went on vigorously to attack the Anglican hierarchy. In particular he targeted the lower clergy for their incessant preaching of passive obedience and divine kingship. Atwood further defended protestant nonconformity, asserting that it was foolish to allow a few rituals and different procedures to keep protestants apart. These things &#145;indifferent&#146; were not worth the price of disunity.<br>
<br>Like many whigs after the Rye House plot trials and executions, Atwood stopped publishing political tracts after 1683. But the revolution of 1688&#150;9 brought Atwood's polemical career back to life. His post-revolution propaganda burst with enthusiasm for the new regime. Atwood signed his new pieces and acknowledged his old. He first set out his defence of the revolution in the preface of his versified translation of Nostradamus, which he believed foretold the revolution. Atwood argued that James II had uncrowned himself. James's abdication was the result of his breach of the &#145;original contract&#146; between himself and the people. Thus &#145;the people&#146; had promoted William and Mary in his place, exercising a power which was rightfully and legally theirs. The original contract, which James had abrogated by his arbitrary actions, was embodied in the coronation oath: &#145;The King's oath is the real contract on his side; and his accepting the government as a legal King&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wonderful Predictions of Nostredamus &hellip; wherein the Grandeur of their Present Majesties &hellip; are Foretold</span>, preface). In 1690 Atwood elaborated upon these arguments in <span class="italic">The Fundamental Constitution of the English Government</span>, a thoroughgoing declaration of the ancient constitution. Like fellow ancient constitutionalists, Atwood maintained that freeborn Englishmen had inherited a set of ancient liberties and privileges passed down and reaffirmed by each successive nation. These liberties were embodied in the laws of Edward the Confessor and each successive monarch vowed to uphold those laws at the swearing of the coronation oath. This was England's ancient heritage, and it was exactly this that James II had violated. &#145;All civil societies&#146;, Atwood argued, &#145;are founded upon CONTRACTS and COVENANTS made between them&#146;. It is &#145;warranted by that noble transcript of the original contract, the Confessor's Law, which shews if a king does not answer the true end for which he was chosen, he looses the name or ceases to be king&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Fundamental Constitution</span>, 4.4). In such cases the people are discharged of their allegiance and must resist this self-abdicated king.<br>
<br>Atwood was well aware that in such cases, wherein a king ceases to be the king, the anonymous author (John Locke) of the <span class="italic">Two Treatises of Government</span> had argued that all civil power returned to the people, who were themselves returned to their original pre-civil state of nature. Atwood had no qualms over Locke's argument that power devolved to the people. But no ancient constitutionalist could countenance the idea of a full dissolution of the government. The ancient constitution never dissolves. If it did, every subject's rights and liberties were lost. The ancient constitution had to remain an unbroken continuum. This being the case, what had happened between 22 December, when James had fled, and 13 February, when William and Mary were proclaimed king and queen? Atwood argued that the &#145;dissolution of the contract between James II and his former subjects&#146; did not destroy the form of government. True, James's flight had produced &#145;a vacancy&#146;. But the government had not dissolved in December 1688. Rather, power had devolved &#145;to the people of legal interests in the government&#146; and they had chosen a successor and through their representatives in parliament they had &#145;duly exercised their rights&#146;. For Atwood the legality of the convention was beyond question. Parliament was the organ of continuity linking the past with the future (<span class="italic">Wonderful Predictions</span>, preface; <span class="italic">Fundamental Constitution</span>, 79).<br>
<br>In the 1690s and early 1700s, Atwood continued to publish whig propaganda as well as tracts on trade, empire, and coinage reform. In June 1700 he was appointed lord chief justice of New York, &#145;a place of considerable profit&#146;  (Luttrell, 4.657). Atwood went to New York with his son, who was also a lawyer, and immediately fell foul of local politicians for &#145;taking too much upon himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Diaries of William Nicolson</span>, 172&#150;3). He was accused of corruption and dismissed by the governor, Lord Cornbury. In his defence Atwood published a pamphlet describing the lawlessness and factionalism he found in New York and how he and his son had to race back to England in fear of their lives. He concluded by stating that it was a &#145;hazardous post of no profit&#146;  (Atwood, 17). In 1704 Atwood published <span class="italic">The superiority and direct dominion of the imperial crown of England over the crown and kingdom of Scotland</span>, a work &#145;directed against the Scottish attempt to assert an independent succession to the northern crown, and against George Ridpath's republication of the writings of Sir Thomas Craig&#146;  (Pocock, &#145;Atwood&#146;). The Scottish parliament ordered Atwood's work to be burned. Thomas Hearne recorded Atwood's death on 22 October 1712, noting that Atwood was &#145;a learned antiquary and a very curious man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.475).<br>
