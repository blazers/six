<span class="headword">Seebohm,  Frederic</span>, Baron Seebohm  (1909&#150;1990), <span class="occ">banker and philanthropist</span>, was born on 18 January 1909 at Poynder's End, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the second in the family of three sons and one daughter of Hugh Exton Seebohm, banker, of Poynder's End, and his wife, Leslie, daughter of George James Gribble. He was the grandson of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36005/', "Frederic Seebohm")</script>. The Seebohm family had emigrated from Germany to Yorkshire in the mid-nineteenth century, and subsequently had been for three generations Quakers and bankers at Hitchin; their bank had been one of the constituents of Barclays Bank on its formation in 1896. Seebohm was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, at Leighton Park School in Reading, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read economics but left after two years (having achieved a third class in part one in 1929) to enter Barclays Bank, Cambridge, in 1929. He spent most of the next twenty-five years first in Sheffield, where he was posted in 1932, and after the war in York and Birmingham, as a local director. During this time he developed his interest in social services as treasurer of the Sheffield Council of Social Service, chairman of the community council in York, and a member of the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust. The Seebohms were related to the Rowntree family.<br>
<br>In 1938 Seebohm joined the Territorial Army and in 1939 was commissioned in the Royal Artillery. After attending the Staff College in 1944, he was posted to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, as a lieutenant-colonel (GSO1). In 1945 he was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the bronze star of America.<br>
<br>Seebohm was appointed a director of Barclays Bank Ltd in 1947 and in 1951 of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas&#151;DCO). In 1957 he moved to London in a full-time executive position in Barclays Bank DCO, becoming a deputy chairman in 1959 and chairman in 1965. Seebohm developed DCO from a federation of retail banks in the former colonies and South Africa into an international bank operating on a worldwide basis.<br>
<br>In spite of constant travelling overseas Seebohm continued to extend his interests in the City as chairman of Friends' Provident Life Office (1962&#150;8), the Export Guarantees Advisory Council (1967&#150;72), and Barclays Bank Ltd, where he became deputy chairman in 1968. In 1966&#150;8 he was president of the Institute of Bankers. He was knighted in 1970. In 1972 he retired as chairman of DCO, which, as part of his international strategy, had been taken over by Barclays Bank Ltd in 1971 and renamed Barclays Bank International. He remained deputy chairman of Barclays until 1974 but, although he remained on the board until 1979, his interests were increasingly elsewhere. From 1974 to 1979 he was chairman of Finance for Industry, which had been set up by the banks in the aftermath of the Second World War to assist in the development of industry, a subject close to his heart.<br>
<br>Seebohm's wider reputation came from his other great interest, social service. His earlier experience made him a natural choice to head the government's inquiry (1965&#150;8) into local authority and allied personal social services, which led to the Seebohm report (1968). The far-reaching conclusions, most of which were embodied in the <span class="roman">Local Authority (Social Services) Act</span> of 1970, owed much to his strong personal convictions, skilled chairmanship, and vigorous advocacy. He was made a life peer in 1972. From the House of Lords, where he sat as an independent, he maintained a close interest in subsequent developments in the social services, as well as in financial matters, and served as chairman of the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust, and president of Age Concern, the National Institute of Social Work, the Royal Africa Society, and the Overseas Development Institute. He was asked by the government to report on naval welfare (1974) and the British Council (1980). He was high sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1970&#150;71. He received honorary degrees of LLD from Nottingham in 1970 and DSc from Aston in 1976.<br>
<br>Seebohm's rather military bearing, conciseness of speech, and formidable powers of chairmanship, combined with a very direct approach and strong, sometimes unconventional, views, won him respect and affection in the many fields to which he contributed. In later years he became a member of the Society of Friends, which his father had left on &#145;marrying out&#146;. He was a keen shot, played real tennis, and was later a skilled gardener and competent watercolour painter. He became an honorary member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.<br>
<br>In 1932 he married Evangeline, daughter of Sir Gerald Hurst QC; they had two daughters (one of them the writer Victoria Glendinning) and one son. Lady Seebohm died thirteen days after her husband as a result of a motor accident near Sutton Scotney in Hampshire. Seebohm died in the accident, on 15 December 1990. A memorial service was held in St Margaret's, Westminster, London, on 13 March 1991.<br>
