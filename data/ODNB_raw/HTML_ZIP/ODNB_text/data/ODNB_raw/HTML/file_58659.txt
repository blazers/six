<span class="headword">Bowater, Sir  Thomas Vansittart</span>, first baronet  (1862&#150;1938), <span class="occ">businessman and politician</span>, was born on 20 October 1862 at Cheetham Hill, Manchester, the eldest child in the family of seven sons and two daughters of William Vansittart Bowater (1838&#150;1907), paper merchant and agent, and his wife, Eliza Jane (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of Thomas Davey of Islington, London. Educated at Broughton College, Manchester, and at Stourbridge, he left school at a comparatively early age to enter the Manchester textile warehouse of J. and N. Phillips as an apprentice. Soon after the family moved back to London about 1880, he joined the family business. He married, on 8 June 1887, Emily Margaret (1867&#150;1924), daughter of John Spencer of Croydon, with whom he had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1889 Thomas Bowater (and two brothers) became partners in W. V. Bowater &amp; Sons. As the buying agents from around 1890 for Alfred and Harold Harmsworth (later respectively viscounts Northcliffe and Rothermere), the company was closely connected with the largest and most successful of all the mass-market publishers and flourished accordingly. By 1900, however, the three brothers rebelled against their father's hard-drinking and tyrannical personality to assume joint control. In 1910 the partnership was turned into a relatively prosperous private company and in January 1914 the brothers decided to enter paper manufacture with the construction of their first paper mill at Northfleet, near Gravesend, Kent, although the intervention of the war ensured that it would not be in operation until 1926.<br>
<br>The company's growth to become by 1938 the world's largest manufacturer of newsprint owed most to the dynamic personality of Bowater's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31996/', "Sir Eric Vansittart Bowater")</script>. Tension between Eric's restless entrepreneurial spirit and his more conservative uncles was resolved with the enforced removal of Thomas Bowater from both the chairmanship and the board (along with his brother Frank) in November 1927. Yet in reality, as the company's historian notes, for some years, the outgoing chairman had &#145;presided with dignity over the affairs of the firm rather than actively managing them&#146;  (Reader, 25).<br>
<br>From at least 1904 Bowater had left his two younger brothers to run the business while he devoted most of his time to public life in the City of London. Having become a freeman in July 1897, he soon became a member of the City board of guardians. After an unsuccessful contest in 1898, he was elected as a common councilman for Vintry ward from 1899 to 1907 serving as chairman of the cattle markets committee in 1903 and the central markets committee in 1905. In 1905 Bowater was also elected as one of the City's two sheriffs and at the end of his term he received a knighthood (June 1906). On 28 August 1907 he was comfortably elected as alderman of Castle Baynard ward, a position he occupied until 1931, when he transferred to the ward of Bridge Without. In 1913 Bowater became lord mayor and soon after (16 July 1914) he was created a baronet. Lord mayor at the outbreak of the First World War (his son Frank held the same office at the outbreak of the Second World War), he was recalled from a motor tour of France only three days before war was declared. He immediately rallied the City, raising a new battalion of the City of London regiment and organizing relief works, particularly for Belgian refugees.<br>
<br>Bowater stood as an independent Conservative in the City of London by-election on 19 May 1922 on a vigorous economy platform. Although the tide had clearly receded since the Anti-Waste League's by-election victories of the previous year, he still polled 6178 votes to the 10,114 for his official Conservative opponent. Standing as a Conservative at another by-election in the City of London in February 1924, he easily defeated his Liberal opponent by 12,962 votes to 5525. He held his seat in this double-member constituency until his death.<br>
<br>Bowater's back-bench parliamentary career was undistinguished: his contribution was confined largely to a few brief questions and interventions either advocating protectionism for the newsprint industry or defending the interests of his constituency. His only significant speech, in March 1931, was a brief but spirited defence of the retention of the business vote for the City of London when all other such qualifications were to be abolished by clause 3 of the unsuccessful <span class="roman">Representation of the People (no. 2) Bill</span>. After his first wife's death in 1924, on 12 August 1925 he married Alice Mary (<i>d</i>. 1949), widow of Archibald Coysgarne Sim of Harrow Weald Park. Bowater died at his home, 53 Hans Mansions, London, on 28 March 1938.<br>
