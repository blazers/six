<span class="headword">Spiller,  James</span>  (1692&#150;1730), <span class="occ">actor and dancer</span>, was born in Gloucester, the son of a carrier. According to George Akerby, a painter and purported friend who wrote an early biography of him, his father had aspirations to educate him as a gentleman; but Spiller had other intentions. He was apprenticed to a landscape painter, but soon tired of a sedentary life and joined a company of strolling players, in spite of his father's disapproval. He began with them as a low comedian, which suited his earthy and irreverent temperament; later he came to specialize also in old men's parts. There are anecdotes about his patience in making up for these and his success in deceiving even near acquaintances whom he met while in character.<br>
<br>Spiller's life with the strollers gave him a lifelong taste for drink, which led him into debt, and into imprisonment from time to time. By December 1709 it had also given him a wife, one Elizabeth Thompson (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;<i>c</i>.1740), an actress, described as &#145;a good pretty woman, with a little too much affectation&#146;  (Akerby, 10). His provincial experience can hardly have lasted long, for he appeared for the first time on the London stage on 6 December 1709, playing the Porter in a Drury Lane revival of John Crowne's <span class="italic">The Country Wit</span> under the management of Aaron Hill. His wife made her d&eacute;but there three days later.<br>
<br>Spiller's career at Drury Lane was intermittent. A personal rivalry shaped its early stages, since his parts duplicated those of William Pinkethman, an older and more established comedian. After a reorganization of the theatre companies in 1710 he was forced to leave Drury Lane to accommodate performers displaced from the now exclusively musical Queen's Theatre, and according to Akerby he went strolling again. But he was back at Drury Lane once or twice in each of the next two years, and was apparently a full member of the company again in the 1712&#150;13 season, when he played among others the part of Ananias, an addition to Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>.<br>
<br>Spiller was now an actor in demand. When John Rich opened the Lincoln's Inn Theatre in 1714 he reminded Spiller of a promise made to his father, the former Drury Lane patent holder Christopher Rich, that he would join his company. Spiller and Pinkethman were again rivals at Drury Lane, and this was another reason for him to move over. He remained with Rich for the rest of his short life. In his first season his parts included Setter in <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span> and Jeremy in <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, both plays being by William Congreve, and Harlequin in <span class="italic">The Emperor of the Moon</span> by Aphra Behn. (He had played this part at Drury Lane in 1709; in February 1715 Pinkethman undertook it at Drury Lane, and Spiller sought to reclaim it at the other house in April.) In subsequent seasons he played a further wide range of parts, including Sir Politick in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> and minor roles in Shakespeare; but his forte was the comic. A ferocious squint, which he developed after the loss of the sight of one eye through smallpox, was an undoubted asset. He was paid well, at &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a day, but not enough to keep pace with his extravagancies. In these years Rich, an outstanding Harlequin, was developing the English pantomime, again in rivalry with Drury Lane. Spiller was a popular Harlequin too. He also gained a niche as a speaker of epilogues, quite frequently mounted on an ass and once (unprovably) on an elephant.<br>
<br>For most of his career Spiller regularly played in the booth theatres set up in the London fairs, Smithfield, Greenwich, and Southwark particularly, when the major theatres closed for the summers. Here his gifts for low comedy found full expression. Pinkethman also ran a theatre booth. Sometimes Spiller joined him, and sometimes he ran against him. On a personal level, the two comedians seem to have been drinking companions, and the story in Akerby that Spiller stole a draft of Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">The Cobbler of Preston</span> from Pinkethman's pocket, after he had drunk him into oblivion, rings true, for Christopher Bullock anticipated the Drury Lane production by a week or two with a spoiling version at Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Spiller separated from his wife at some point, and lived with his mistress, a Dinah Stratford, of Wild Street, who when the 14<i>d</i>. a week he allowed her was insufficient was occasionally reduced to the undignified trade of selling asparagus, or sometimes hot baked faggots. Another of his mistresses was a Mrs D., whom he shared with a duke until the duke found Spiller wearing one of his own shirts.<br>
<br>Spiller's extravagant life kept him in debt, and in 1722 he had to shelter in The Mint, a refuge in Southwark; later, after The Mint was suppressed, he found himself in the Marshalsea. But The Mint gave him the name of his part in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggars' Opera</span> (1728)&#151;Matt of the Mint, in which character Gay gave him the appropriate song &#145;Fill every glass, for wine inspires us&#146;. In this role he was also depicted on the special benefit ticket engraved for him by William Hogarth. One of his gaolers in the Marshalsea retired and took an inn in Clare Market, renaming it the Spiller's Head.<br>
<br>Spiller's death was sudden. Frederick, prince of Wales, commanded a performance at Lincoln's Inn Theatre of Lewis Theobald's <span class="italic">The Rape of Proserpine</span> on 7 February 1730, and Spiller, cast as Clodpole, rose from his sickbed to appear. He died on stage of apoplexy. He was buried on 10 February at St Clement Danes, London, at Rich's expense. Akerby's <span class="italic">Life of Mr James Spiller, the Late Famous Comedian</span> was hastily written, being dated &#145;1729&#146; and hence clearly in print before 24 March, when the new year would have officially begun. Many of the anecdotes in it appear also in <span class="italic">Spiller's Jests</span> (<i>c</i>.1730), which is one of the less amusing joke books of the period.<br>
