<span class="headword">Knell,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587), <span class="occ">actor</span>, may have been the son of Henry Knell, an immigrant from Bremen whose will was proved on 17 September 1585, though there is nothing more than an uncommon name to link them. The details of Knell's early career as a player are not known, but he was prominent enough by 1583, or at the latest by 1585, to be selected by Edmund Tilney, under commission from Sir Francis Walsingham, as one in the new company of Queen's Men. The selection is significant because it was expected of Tilney that the Queen's Men would outshine all rival companies, then operating under the patronage of such Tudor grandees as the earls of Sussex, Leicester, and Warwick. In a group rich in clowns, Knell's specialism was probably in heroic parts: he is described as &#145;playing Henry the fift&#146; in the book of <span class="italic">Tarlton's Jests</span>  (<span class="italic">Shakespeare Jest-Books</span>, ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 1864, 2.218), presumably in <span class="italic">The Famous Victories of Henry V</span>, which is known to have been in the repertory of the Queen's Men. It is the only role to which Knell's name can be confidently attached.<br>
<br>The Queen's Men, whether or not the members individually shared Walsingham's concerns, were expected to tour the provinces during the summer and early autumn with a broadly protestant and insistently patriotic repertory. Travelling conditions were rough and the schedule often gruelling. In such circumstances, friendships are tested. On the evening of 13 June 1587, for reasons unknown, Knell drew his sword and attacked his fellow actor John Towne. It was in self-defence, a coroner's inquest concluded, that Towne stuck his own sword through his assailant's neck. Knell was dead within half an hour. The skirmish took place in White Hound Close, Thame, near Oxford. Because the Queen's Men visited Stratford upon Avon during this same tour, speculative biographers have mentioned Shakespeare as a possible replacement for Knell, but there is no evidence to sustain the theory.<br>
<br>Administration of Knell's estate was granted to his widow, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1619), by the commissary court of London on 12 December 1587. In that ruling, Knell is referred to as &#145;of St Mary Aldermanbury&#146;, but his place of burial is unknown. On 10 March 1588 Rebecca married the actor John Heminges, famous as Shakespeare's colleague and editor; they had several children. She died in the late summer of 1619, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 2 September. Heminges's will makes no mention of children by her first husband.<br>
