<span class="headword">Ellis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Neilson]</span>,  Ruth</span>  (1926&#150;1955), <span class="occ">nightclub hostess and convicted murderer</span>, was born on 9 October 1926 at 74 West Parade, Rhyl, north Wales, the fourth of six children of Arthur Neilson (formerly Hornby), musician, and his wife, Elisaberta Goodall, a seamstress.<br>
<br>Born into poverty, Ruth determined very early that she would not live a life like her parents. &#145;She wasn't like my other children&#146; her mother recalled, &#145;she was so very ambitious for herself. She used to say &#147;Mum, I'm going to make something of my life&#148;&#146;  (Hancock, 16). When her father's work as a jobbing musician on the ocean liners and in the cinemas evaporated with the advent of the &#145;talkies&#146;, the family moved to Basingstoke, and Ruth attended the local Fairfields Senior Girls' School. It was soon obvious that she intended her passport to a better life to be not education but rather her charm, prettiness, and opportunistic energy. Marriage seemed the first and most obvious means of escape, but the Canadian serviceman on whom she pinned her hopes, and with whom she had become pregnant, proved to have a wife and two children back home. It was 1944 and Ruth Neilson was just eighteen. This common betrayal destroyed what little confidence Ruth had in human relations. &#145;I did not feel that anything could hurt me any more and I had become emotionally rather cold and rather spent &hellip; somehow in my association with men nothing touched me&#146;  (ibid., 19) was how she described herself then. Her son, Clare Andrea Neilson, was born on 15 September 1944 and given his father's forenames.<br>
<br>From being a factory hand, waitress, and shop worker, Ruth turned to more lucrative and risky pursuits: photographer's model at an amateur camera club, and then hostess for a notorious vice boss with a string of clubs and brothels in Mayfair. The Court Club in Duke Street and the Hollywood in Welbeck Street were the first two clubs where Ruth worked in 1946, taking home &pound;20 a week, almost ten times what she had been earning in Woolworths in Brixton.<br>
<br>Ruth Neilson became Ruth Ellis when she married, on 8 November 1950, George Johnston Ellis (1909&#150;1958), a divorced and alcoholic dentist for whom she felt vaguely sorry and with whom she hoped to gain some financial security. But the drinking, continual arguments over money, and Ruth's suspicions and violent jealousy meant the marriage was bitterly over by the time their daughter, Georgina, was born on 2 October 1951.<br>
<br>Short of money again and now with two children to support, Ruth returned to the vice boss: she continued her work as a hostess and call-girl. She then met in 1953 David Moffatt Drummond Blakely (1926&#150;1955), a racing car enthusiast and the youngest child of a Sheffield doctor. Blakely was a reckless and feckless young man who frequented the Little Club, a disreputable drinking club in Knightsbridge where Ellis had become manager. Although he was engaged to another woman, and Ellis was still seeing her clients, the two became lovers. Quite soon, however, his drinking and possessiveness caused trouble in the club and Ellis found herself a second man friend, sharing her favours between them.<br>
<br>Desmond Edward Cussen had been a bomber pilot during the war and then became a director of the family firm of tobacconists. Well-off and bored, he belonged to the same circle of motor racing enthusiasts as Blakely. Alcohol was the most important currency between them and Ruth Ellis, Blakely, and Cussen all drank excessively. Resentments, jealousies, and violent drunken fights between Blakely and Ellis were commonplace. Cussen wanted to extract Ellis from the explosive relationship with his younger rival and had offered to marry her himself. But Ellis was infatuated with Blakely, and became obsessively and morbidly so when he decided to end the relationship at the beginning of the 1955 Easter holiday.<br>
<br>By Easter Sunday, 10 April, Ruth Ellis had endured three days of sleeplessness, panic, and pathological jealousy, fuelled by quantities of Pernod and a reckless consumption of tranquillizers. It appears that in this state she was given a 38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver by Cussen, who had oiled and loaded it and shown her how to use it. He then drove her to the Magdala public house in Hampstead where they expected David Blakely to be. Cussen waited in the car while Ellis set off to find her former lover. She caught Blakely as he left the pub with a friend: oblivious to everything else she pumped four bullets into his fleeing body. Hysteria broke out around her: &#145;Arrest me&#151;I have just shot this man&#151;and fetch an ambulance&#146;  (Hancock, 10) she said with icy calm to the first available policeman.<br>
<br>It seemed to the witnesses to be a cold-blooded murder, and nothing Ruth Ellis said in court in her defence altered the opinion that it was premeditated. She refused to plead insanity and the jury would not accept her defence of provocation. For her own reasons, Ellis had shielded Cussen's crucial involvement in the tragedy. Only the day before her execution did she admit his complicity to her lawyer, Victor Mishcon, afterwards Lord Mishcon. However, Desmond Cussen could not be found in time to corroborate her story and the home secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, later Viscount Tenby, refused to reprieve her.<br>
<br>Ruth Ellis was hanged on the morning of 13 July 1955 at Holloway prison, north London. She was twenty-eight years old. She impressed everyone with her control and courage; the prospect of being executed for a crime she never denied was marginally less unpleasant to her than that of growing old in prison, as unprivileged and deprived of hope and opportunity as she had been as a child. She was buried first in Holloway prison, and later reburied in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>The circumstances of her death assured Ruth Ellis the fame and significance she had failed to find in life. The natural public interest in her case was intensified by her startling platinum-blonde looks, glacial manner, and life in the seedier reaches of Mayfair's clubland. The guilty verdict and the death sentence ensured the trial became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, the verdict still debated today. As it turned out, Ruth Ellis was the last woman to be judicially hanged in Britain: the widespread and international revulsion against her punishment expedited the establishment of a law of &#145;diminished responsibility&#146; in the <span class="roman">Homicide Act</span> of 1957.<br>
<br>Following her death some campaigned for Ruth Ellis's verdict of murder to be commuted to one of manslaughter, on the grounds of provocation and diminished responsibility; judgment was reserved after a hearing at the Court of Appeal in September 2003. But she will remain memorialized as the last woman to be hanged, the glamorous blonde, guilty of a classic <i>crime passionnel</i>, whose execution hastened the abolition of the death penalty in Great Britain. Circumstances, timing, and the fact that she was so young, good-looking, and a woman had combined to award Ruth Ellis her small, brave place in history. It seems likely she would have been happy enough with that. Miranda Richardson played the part of Ruth Ellis in Mike Newell's film of her life, <span class="italic">Dance with a Stranger</span> (1985).<br>
