<span class="headword">Marshall,  Catherine Elizabeth</span>  (1880&#150;1961), <span class="occ">suffragist and internationalist</span>, was born on 29 April 1880 at Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, the elder of two children of Francis E. Marshall (1847&#150;1922), mathematics master at Harrow School, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colbeck (<i>d</i>. 1927), formerly a teacher. Catherine Marshall was first educated privately and then for three years (1896&#150;9) at St Leonard's School, St Andrews, and was stimulated by music, travel, and discussion (which had a politically and ethically liberal bias). But no career seems to have been planned for her.<br>
<br>The suffrage movement transformed Marshall's life. Assisted by her parents, she built up a strong local suffrage society in Keswick (where the family lived after her father's retirement): it was a branch of the non-militant National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She developed her remarkable flair for organization and became known for innovative and effective work. The London-based executive and administration of the NUWSS did not well serve the dynamic new societies at the periphery (and especially in the north), so Marshall and kindred spirits in the NUWSS used the organization's fundamentally democratic, but out-of-date, constitution to gain acceptance for a new structure. Based on a balance between the national council and new provincial councils the new constitution was accepted at a tense council meeting in March 1910 against considerable opposition from the old guard. Power was distributed more evenly between London and the provinces, giving an effective voice to a whole new constituency with a wider geographical and class base.<br>
<br>Although the activities of the militant suffragettes are more widely known, the essential work of one-by-one conversion of the public, members of parliament, and ultimately of party leaders, was accomplished largely by the NUWSS. The organization had been developed into a remarkable political tool under the leadership, as honorary parliamentary secretary and honorary secretary respectively, of Catherine Marshall and Kathleen Courtney, who both worked full-time at national headquarters between 1911 and 1914. Tall, well dressed, well informed, and dynamic, Marshall could hold the attention of an outdoor audience of miners, and was also a familiar figure to members of parliament, as she pressed the converted for action, cultivated sympathizers, and shamed backsliders.<br>
<br>When private members' bills on women's suffrage were stalled repeatedly by the Liberal government, Marshall worked towards having suffrage adopted as party policy. First the Labour Party was brought to full official support for the cause by intense lobbying in the trade unions, among working women, and in the party hierarchy, and by help from the NUWSS in elections. By 1913 some leading Liberals and Unionists also recognized the inevitability of adopting franchise reform, but the war, by delaying the expected general election of 1915, prevented the culmination of Marshall's strategy. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, the NUWSS put its political work on hold. Soon divisions, previously papered over, surfaced in a new form. Marshall, with like-minded suffragists in Britain and elsewhere, wanted the suffrage movement to work towards a well-informed and hate-free climate for peacemaking after the war. Millicent Fawcett, president of the NUWSS, saw talk of peace as treacherous, finding approval especially among those who had disliked the Labour Party connection. By the end of the struggle the NUWSS was back in the hands of middle-class Londoners and Marshall and her friends had resigned from office.<br>
<br>The history of the non-militant women's suffrage campaign, written by Marshall's opponents, omitted not only any in-depth account of the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle but almost all mention of Marshall's pre-war achievements: even the archives of the NUWSS may have been &#145;weeded&#146;. Marshall herself, throughout her life, wrote only short articles addressing current causes.<br>
<br>Marshall had thought deeply about the role of force in politics, and rejected the force-based arguments of anti-suffragists and militants alike. Her conclusions, that good government rested on the consent of the governed, and that to base governance on physical force was particularly inimical to the rights of women, translated readily to the international sphere. For Marshall, to work for a more peaceful world was to work for the women's cause. She helped to plan the Women's International Congress at The Hague in April 1915, but she was prevented by government action from attending it. She went on to help develop the British section of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, later the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), and from early 1916 she became involved with the No-Conscription Fellowship, where, with Bertrand Russell, she was particularly engaged in the political field, monitoring the experiences of conscientious objectors and keeping the issues in the public and parliamentary eye.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Catherine Marshall fell in love with (Reginald) Clifford Allen, later Lord Allen of Hurtwood (1889&#150;1939), the charismatic chair of the No-Conscription Fellowship, and suffered deeply when he was imprisoned; he was physically frail, and his health deteriorated rapidly in prison. By mid-1917, Catherine Marshall was compulsively driving herself towards breakdown, and Allen's health was further threatened by his intention of embarking on a hunger and work strike in prison. By the end of the year, Marshall had collapsed and Allen was released seriously ill. When both were convalescent they spent several months together in what seems to have been a &#145;trial marriage&#146;; Marshall was devastated when the relationship ended. She found solace in theosophy and in spiritual dancing, and, more concretely, in renewed work for peace. She recovered her health just in time to go to the Women's International Congress in Z&uuml;rich in May 1919, attended by women from defeated as well as victorious nations; the congress was among the first to critique the peace terms and the covenant of the League of Nations.<br>
<br>Throughout the inter-war years, Marshall's career was on a roller-coaster, swinging between time spent caring for ailing parents, bouts of phlebitis and other severe (but unnamed) illness, and periods of intense international peace work. She was present (with the protection of Prince Max of Baden) when the Reichstag in Berlin accepted the humiliating peace terms of 1919; and at the time of the invasion of the Ruhr in 1923&#150;4, she went as WILPF envoy to the heads of state in France and Germany, and also visited workers involved in non-violent resistance in the Ruhr itself.<br>
<br>During the early years of the League of Nations, Marshall was often in Geneva, at the headquarters of the WILPF. Refusing to be sidelined into causes thought suitable for women, she directed her attention to those issues which might serve in the overall objective of an enduring peace, and used her lobbying skills in the cause of treaty revision, increased openness in League of Nations membership and procedure, disarmament, protection of minorities, the principle of self-determination, the just working of the mandate system, and economic reform, as well, always, as the appointment of more women to positions of international power. As in the pre-war suffrage movement, the work was mostly carried on out of the spotlight, attempting to build opinion by influencing individual statesmen behind the scenes. Unlike the suffrage cause, however, successes were small and rare, and no ultimate triumph came. Marshall was increasingly debilitated by ill health, as the peace movement was by the rise of fascism.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Marshall brought renewed energy to bear on the cause of Czech refugees, working for their reception and settlement in Britain, and making a home for some at the house by Derwentwater inherited by herself and her brother Harold; but her service to them was palliative rather than political. After the Second World War she settled in Golders Green, Middlesex, in a remarkable house at 2 Linnell Drive, built in the 1920s for herself and Harold, who, however, married in 1927 and lived elsewhere. Her lifelong incompetence in managing money caused Harold considerable concern, and once landed her in court for non-payment of taxes, but theirs remained an affectionate relationship. She continued to be active in the local Labour Party branch, and with other social, political, and international concerns. Remembered as a woman of humour and courage, Catherine Marshall died in the New End Hospital, Hampstead, on 22 March 1961 after a fall at her home.<br>
<br>The trajectory of Marshall's life, rising to a brilliant effectiveness in her late thirties and forties, and declining thereafter, is in part attributable to the lack of openings for a gifted woman in public life, and in part to poor health; the two may have been connected. When she died, her achievements were little known, but were to be recovered by the end of the century.<br>
