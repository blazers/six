<span class="headword">Holloway, Sir  Henry</span>  (1857&#150;1923), <span class="occ">builder</span>, was born on 5 August 1857 at Littleton, West Lavington, Wiltshire, the fourth of the five sons of Thomas Holloway, jobbing builder and bricklayer, of West Lavington, and his wife, Elizabeth Orchard. After the family moved to London, Holloway went to a church school in Pimlico. For a short time he worked for a firm of timber merchants, but in 1876 he, his father, and three brothers joined Holloway's eldest brother, James, who had set up his own building and contracting business in Wandsworth Road in 1875. Holloway was the office manager. On 16 February 1881 he married Annie Jane, eldest daughter of John Gollop of Clapham. They had seven children. In 1882 he and his older brother, (Henry) Thomas (1853&#150;1914), left the firm after James had refused to make them partners, and started their own company, Holloway Brothers, in Battersea. After James's premature death in 1889, Henry and Thomas took over his business, and their father and other two brothers joined Holloway Brothers.<br>
<br>The business became very successful very rapidly. The first important contract came in 1891 for the new Battersea Polytechnic, designed by E. W. Mountford in the Flemish Renaissance style. After the company won the contract for the new naval barracks at Chatham in 1897 contracts for the construction of large public buildings poured in. Among these were the Admiralty building in Horse Guards Parade (1898), the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey (1900&#150;7), the United Universities Club, Pall Mall (1905&#150;6), and the new General Post Office (1907&#150;10), an early example of the use of reinforced concrete in a major public building in London. Whiteleys store in Bayswater (1908&#150;12) was one of the first buildings to be built with a steel frame, allowing much larger display windows. Holloways also won several important housing contracts, including a housing scheme for Wandsworth borough council at Earlsfield, and the building of a garden city at Rosyth for the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In 1900 the expanding business moved to a larger site at Victoria Wharf, Belvedere Road, on the south bank of the Thames. This meant that stone, bricks, and other materials could be landed directly onto the wharf, and timber was shipped directly from Scandinavia. New joinery and stonemasonry works were built, and it was the first London firm of builders to use electricity to drive its machinery. In 1902 Holloway Brothers (London) Ltd was registered as a private limited company, with Henry and Thomas Holloway as governing directors. Also in 1902 they opened a West End branch at 43 South Audley Street to provide craftsmen to decorate houses in Mayfair. This later became a leading interior decorator for large buildings.<br>
<br>From 1906 Holloway Brothers began to take on civil engineering contracts. The first project was to build a covered reservoir in reinforced concrete for the Luton Water Company. The company went on to win dock contracts, such as that for the London docks improvement scheme, starting in 1912, railway contracts, including a new power station for the London and North Western Railway in 1914, and contracts for sea defence works such as the construction of a new sea wall at Rottingdean in 1907&#150;13. Its first major bridge-building contract was in 1914, for a three-span reinforced concrete bridge over the River Esk at Gretna.<br>
<br>Holloway Brothers was forced to move again, in 1915, because London county council wanted the Belvedere Road site for County Hall and managed to get a bill through parliament permitting this. The new site, at Bridge Wharf on the corner of Vauxhall Bridge and Grosvenor Road, on Millbank, was too small for all the works, and the joinery works had to be moved to Earlsfield, and the masonry works to Nine Elms. A branch office opened in Newcastle in 1917 to handle the growing business in the north-east.<br>
<br>Holloway was knighted in 1917 for his contribution to solving the problem of the shortage of housing for the labour force needed to work in the new wartime factories. David Lloyd George, minister of munitions, approached Holloway, and he undertook to provide the necessary housing within six months. This he did, after touring the country in 1916 as director of housing construction in the labour supply department of the Ministry of Munitions, and putting local architects and builders to work, a brilliant feat of organization.<br>
<br>It was Henry Holloway's drive and organizational ability that had made the company so successful so quickly. He was highly respected by his colleagues, and served as president of the Institute of Builders and of the London Master Builders' Association. A JP for the county of London, Holloway also took an interest in politics, and campaigned for John Moulton (later Baron Moulton), elected Liberal MP for Clapham in 1885, and for Reginald McKenna, who contested Clapham unsuccessfully in 1892. He was a fervent member of the Wesleyan Methodist church (his father had been a local preacher), and supported the temperance movement.<br>
<br>Holloway died at his home, Draxmont, Wimbledon Hill, Surrey, on his birthday, 5 August 1923. He was survived by his wife. His youngest brother, Samuel, succeeded him as chairman of Holloway Brothers (London) Ltd. He was buried at Upper Tooting Wesleyan Church, Balham High Road, London, three days later.<br>
<br>The other member of the family who was to lead the firm was Sir Henry's nephew, <a name="cosubject_51913"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Thomas Holloway</span>  (1876&#150;1951), <span class="occ">builder</span>. Born on 29 March 1876, at 3 Tipthorpe Road, Battersea, London, H. T. Holloway was the fifth in the family of eight children of (Henry) Thomas Holloway, co-founder of the company, and his wife, Phebe Jane Holt. Nothing is known about his education but he married Brucine Mildenhall Pimm in 1911. They had two sons.<br>
<br>H. T. Holloway was a director from 1912, and chairman from 1933 until his death. Under his chairmanship the civil engineering side of the business expanded, starting with the new Chelsea Bridge in 1934&#150;7, its first steel bridge. The company also took on a number of civil engineering projects in the Middle East from the 1930s onwards, including the King Ghazi and King Feisal bridges across the Tigris in Baghdad in 1936, and Baghdad railway station in 1946&#150;52.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the company built ordnance depots and factories, hospitals, army camps, and RAF stations. It also built sea forts and floating docks, and its expertise contributed significantly to the success of the Mulberry harbour project. To improve coal supplies, it built opencast coal mines from 1942 onwards in the Dukeries and Newcastle coalfields. Holloway was knighted in 1945 for his contribution to the war effort. After the war, the company was greatly involved in post-war reconstruction, including that of Trafalgar Square, completed in 1948. Holloway was a member of the council of the London Master Builders' Association, a president of the Institute of Builders, and president (1940&#150;46) of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. He served on the joint consultative council of building and civil engineering institutes at the Ministry of Works in 1941&#150;6.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Thomas Holloway died on 18 September 1951 at St Peter's Hospital, Westminster. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints' Church, West Lavington, Wiltshire. His wife survived him.<br>
