<span class="headword">Smith,  Samuel</span>  (1765&#150;1841), <span class="occ">dean of Christ Church, Oxford</span>, was born in Westminster, London, on 20 September 1765, the eldest in the family of two daughters and five sons (one of whom died young) of Samuel Smith (1731/2&#150;1808), headmaster of Westminster School from 1764 to 1788, and his first wife, Anna Jackson. He was a pupil at Westminster School from 1772, and (as captain of the school) matriculated from there at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1782; his college tutors were John Randolph and Phineas Pett, later his canonical colleagues. Smith himself was for a few years a tutor at Christ Church, but in 1803 he resigned his studentship to become incumbent of Daventry (a Christ Church living). On 9 August that year he married Anne Brady (1781/2&#150;1826), daughter of William Barnett of Arcadia, Jamaica, where the Smiths sold four slaves in 1825.<br>
<br>Smith returned to Christ Church as a canon in 1807. Appointments as subdean (1809) and treasurer (1813) suggest that he was early marked out for appointment as dean; this came in 1824, when he succeeded the handsome but incapable C. H. Hall, other candidates being Edmund Goodenough, headmaster of Westminster, and Charles Lloyd, another canon of Christ Church. Smith's wife died on 23 February 1826, shortly after the birth of their thirteenth child; this loss made him for some time anxious to resign, and may help to account for the relative lack of distinction of his period of office.<br>
<br>Smith has been dismissed as &#145;Presence of Mind Smith&#146; from his alleged remark on returning without his companion from a disastrous outing on the river: &#145;If I had not with great presence of mind hit him on the head with a boathook both would have been drowned&#146;, but the story comes from <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Oxford</span> (1st edn, 1900) by William Tuckwell, who in his second edition (1907) consigned it to oblivion; moreover, there was no charge of murder. As dean, Smith attempted to revert to the practices and manners of Hall's great predecessor, Cyril Jackson, but he lacked the ability to manage those with whom a dean of Christ Church had to deal. He was worsted by George IV in a tussle over appointments to studentships; a riot in 1825 led the duke of Wellington to transfer his two eldest sons to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Smith failed to mobilize chapter and common room to achieve the desired result in the by-election following the resignation of Robert Peel early in 1829, the lead being taken by Charles Lloyd. The Revd Frederick Oakeley, later a convert to Rome, a graduate at Christ Church while Smith was dean, thought him &#145;remarkable for nothing but his good nature&#146; and &#145;the most irregular and unpunctual attendant&#146; at college services; however, &#145;the moral and religious state of Christ Church &hellip; was in a state of progressive improvement&#146; under Smith  (Quiller-Couch, 319, 329&#150;30). These are tendentious claims: it is clear that men prominent in the political, ecclesiastical, legal, and learned life of later Victorian England were admitted to Christ Church in Smith's day. Gladstone's diary for his Christ Church years suggests that in Smith's period as dean, though there were many distractions, a man of exceptional powers could find like-minded friends at Christ Church and read hard and widely; it was Smith who nominated Gladstone to a studentship. Smith published nothing, and at Christ Church he built nothing. However, in Smith's short reign nine men were admitted to Christ Church who achieved a place in the <span class="italic">DNB</span>.<br>
<br>Smith exchanged the deanery for the &#145;golden stall&#146; at Durham with Thomas Gaisford in 1831. At Dry Drayton, near Cambridge, he had succeeded his father as patron and incumbent in 1808, presented his own eldest son, Samuel, in 1829, and himself for the second time in 1831. Like his father Smith was fond of gambling on horses, though with marked lack of success; he shared this propensity with few or no other deans of Christ Church. He had six sons, one of whom died young and four of whom became Anglican clergymen, and seven daughters. Smith died on 19 January 1841 in Dry Drayton, Cambridgeshire, where he was buried. In his last ten years at Durham Smith, though conscientious, was not a prime mover in the origins of the new University.<br>
