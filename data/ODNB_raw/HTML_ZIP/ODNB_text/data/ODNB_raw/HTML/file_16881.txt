<span class="headword">Loch,  Granville Gower</span>  (1813&#150;1853), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 28 February 1813, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16883/', "James Loch (1780&#150;1855)")</script> of Drylaw in Midlothian and his first wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1842), youngest daughter of Patrick Orr; he was the brother of George Loch and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16882/', "Henry Brougham Loch, first Baron Loch")</script>. He entered the navy in February 1826, passed his examination in 1832, and was promoted lieutenant on 23 October 1833. After serving on the home station and in the Mediterranean he was promoted commander 28 February 1837. From 1838 to 1840 he commanded the <i>Fly</i> (18 guns) on the South American and Pacific stations, and in 1841 the steamer <i>Vesuvius</i> in the Mediterranean. He was promoted captain on 26 August 1841, then went to China as a volunteer, and at the capture of Chinkiang Foo (Zhenjiang Fu) served as an aide-de-camp to General Sir Hugh Gough. He afterwards published his journal as <span class="italic">The Closing Events of the Campaign in China</span> (1843).<br>
<br>From 1846 to 1849 Loch commanded the frigate <i>Alarm</i> (26 guns) in the West Indies; in February 1848 he was sent to the coast of Nicaragua to demand and enforce redress for certain outrages, and to obtain the release of two British subjects who had been carried off from San Juan by the military commandant. The government at the time seemed to be in the hands of the army, and, without delay, Loch proceeded up the river in the boats of the <i>Alarm</i> and the sloop <i>Vixen</i>, with a total force of 260 men. The enemy had occupied a strong position at Serapaqui, defended not only by the nature of the ground and built obstructions, but by a 5 knot current which kept the boats under fire for an hour and a half before the men could land. The fort was then captured and demolished, the guns destroyed, and the ammunition thrown into the river. The British demands were conceded and a treaty was arranged: on Palmerston's recommendation Loch was made a CB on 30 May 1848.<br>
<br>In 1852 Loch commissioned the frigate <i>Winchester</i> (50 guns) to relieve the <i>Hastings</i> as flagship in China and the East Indies. It was the time of the Second Anglo-Burmese War. Shortly after arriving at Rangoon, Admiral Austen died of cholera; the commodore was off the coast, and command on the Irrawaddy devolved on Loch. His task principally involved keeping the river clear and driving the Burmese out of positions they occupied on its banks. At the beginning of 1853 a dacoit chief, Nya-Myat-Toon, had brought together a strong force, stockaded a formidable position at Donabew, stopped the traffic, and repelled an attempt to drive him away. Loch in person led a joint naval and military expedition against him, landed, and threaded his way by a narrow path through thick jungle. They found the stockade on the farther bank of a steep ravine, in attempting to cross which they were repulsed with heavy losses. On 4 February Loch was shot through the body and he died two days later. He was buried at Rangoon, beneath a stone erected by the officers and men of the <i>Winchester</i>. A monument was erected to his memory in St Paul's Cathedral. He was unmarried.<br>
