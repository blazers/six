<span class="headword">Wilson,  Effingham</span>  (1785&#150;1868), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born on 28 September 1785 at Kirkby Ravensworth in Yorkshire, one of at least five sons of Joseph Wilson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1734) and his wife, Jane Hutchinson. His father, the son of a Yorkshire grazier, had at one time been a journeyman packer in London. Wilson was named from his family having farmed under the earl of Effingham. He was originally intended for medicine, and was in part brought up by his uncle, the phrenologist Dr Thomas Hutchinson of Knaresborough. In London by 1802, he married Martha Hunt on 23 July 1804. He worked with James Asperne, of the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, Thomas Hurst, of Longmans, and perhaps Thomas Tegg, who witnessed Wilson's admission to the Clothworkers' Company on 7 February 1810.<br>
<br>Wilson began in business for himself first near St Paul's, but by 1812 was firmly established at the Royal Exchange (where he remained for the rest of his career, apart from an enforced absence during the rebuilding of 1838&#150;44). He became the determined champion of a free press: &#145;It is like the air we breathe: if we have it not, we die&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Memory</span>, 36). Soon a familiar figure in radical circles, he assisted his fellow bookseller William Hone in preparing the famous defence to the triple libel trial of 1817. He published the notorious <span class="italic">Church-of-Englandism</span> (1818) and the &#145;unpublishable&#146; <span class="italic">The Elements of the Art of Packing</span> (1821), both by Jeremy Bentham. He brought out T. Perronet Thompson's assaults on the corn laws, the &#145;revolting heresies&#146; of William Godwin, and the social visions of Robert Owen. His edition of <span class="italic">The Extraordinary Black Book</span> (1831) by John Wade, the &#145;Reformers' Bible&#146;, presaged the passing of the <span class="roman">Great Reform Act</span> of 1832, for his services to which cause Wilson was granted a testimonial. His first wife having died, he married Maria James on 16 November 1822.<br>
<br>Wilson also built a business as a specialist publisher of financial pamphlets and texts that continued under his son William and lasted until taken over by Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons in 1932. His list was wide-ranging enough to include illustrated books and travel books, as well as the first regular publications of both Alfred, Lord Tennyson (<span class="italic">Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</span>, 1830) and Robert Browning (<span class="italic">Paracelsus</span>, 1835). An advocate of progress in all forms, early in his career Wilson was the first in his area to illuminate his premises with gaslight, &#145;to the terror of his timid neighbours, and in spite of their prophetic remonstrances&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Memory</span>, 29). He was on the first train into London and founded the earliest <span class="italic">Railway Magazine</span> in 1835. He was also closely involved with George Birkbeck and the popular education movement, contending that each child should &#145;have that given to it which nobody can take away&#146;  (ibid., 28).<br>
<br>Wilson was a fit and powerful man, a sportsman who also published the first cricketing classic&#151;John Nyren's <span class="italic">The Young Cricketer's Tutor</span> in 1833. He boasted sixty years in London without a headache. Publicly a man who &#145;shrank instinctively from compromise&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Memory</span>, 39), his private life was one of kindliness, friendship, and moving generosity. A particularly notable characteristic was his tenderness towards his many children (perhaps fifteen in all, of whom a son and five daughters of the first marriage, and two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36957/', "Henry Sch&#252;tz Wilson (1824&#150;1902)")</script>, and two daughters of the second marriage are certainly known). Wilson died at 38 Mildmay Park, Islington, London, on 9 June 1868 and was buried at Highgate cemetery, on 15 June 1868. His obituary in the <span class="italic">City Press</span>, 18 July 1868 (reprinted with other tributes as <span class="italic">In Memory of Effingham Wilson</span>, 1868), claimed for him &#145;the longest career, and, we believe, the most independent, public-spirited, and fearless career, of any publisher of his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Memory</span>, 7).<br>
