<span class="headword">Urmston <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hughes]</span>,  Harriett Elizabeth Hughes</span>  (1828&#150;1897), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 20 January 1828 at Clapham Common, Surrey, the fifth of six daughters of William Hughes Hughes (1792&#150;1874), MP for Oxford, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Field (<i>d</i>. 1870). She lived at the family's summer home at Ryde, Isle of Wight, until she was eighteen, receiving her education from a governess. Her future husband, Henry Brabazon Urmston (1829&#150;1898), son of Sir James Brabazon Urmston, was accepted as a cadet by the East India Company. He sailed for Bengal in 1847; in September 1850 Harriett left England and the couple married at the military station, Barrackpore, on 15 November 1850. They remained in India, with two furloughs home, until 1875.<br>
<br>As the wife of a military officer and, after 1854, a civilian, Harriett's life was a series of relocations. With a growing family she often had little time for direct mission work; instead, the Urmstons opened their home to Anglican missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, as well as to local clergymen. Harriett made her convictions known by refusing to attend balls, the theatre, or the races. She derived spiritual sustenance from a long-running correspondence with Mary Kershaw, a Yorkshire invalid and active supporter of mission work; they began writing to each other in 1869 and the friendship was to end only on Harriett's death.<br>
<br>Harriett Urmston found an opportunity for full-time missionary activity when her husband was sent to Rawalpindi as deputy commissioner in 1868. They remained there until 1874. By the terms of a neutrality proclamation, she was not permitted to evangelize among the people of India; in the cantonment were British soldiers, and instead she began a mothers' meeting for soldiers' wives, which in turn became a meeting for soldiers. Her services combined newly popular Sankey hymns and a sermon on a biblical text. Her practical exhortations proved popular and many were converted by her. Her unashamed ministry to any who would listen earned her the epithet &#145;Holy Mary&#146;.<br>
<br>Poor health forced the Urmstons' return to England in 1875 and they settled in Southsea, Hampshire. Harriett became involved with the Zenana Bible and Medical Missionary Society and between 1875 and 1884 addressed more than 300 meetings on its behalf. She visited the dockyard dining halls to lecture on temperance and, at the behest of Frederick Charrington (1850&#150;1936), preached thirteen times at the Assembly Hall, Mile End, in east London, in 1878&#150;9. In one year, 1877, she gave 276 addresses at which a total of 32,700 people were present. She was frequently invited to preach at local mission halls. In 1885 the Urmstons moved to Maidstone, Kent, where she regularly visited about eighty households in the parish.<br>
<br>Harriett Urmston blended biblical knowledge, fervent piety, spiritual authority, and practical knowledge. Her forthrightness, especially in later life, earned her some reproach, but her biographer dismisses this as an (albeit unfortunate) product of her great zeal. She died from typhoid at her home, Ardenlee, Maidstone, on 4 September 1897. She was survived by her husband and six of their eight children: Mary Grace (1853&#150;1933), Gertrude Elizabeth (1858&#150;1916), Arthur Brabazon (<i>b</i>. 1861), Robert Bruce Brabazon (<i>b</i>. 1862), Beatrice Brabazon (<i>b</i>. 1864), and Florence Macan (<i>b</i>. 1866). The eldest son, Henry Brabazon (1851&#150;1888), was killed on the Afghan frontier; and the second son, Herbert Edwardes (1855&#150;1885), died after being invalided out of the Royal Navy.<br>
