<span class="headword">Hargreaves,  William Mason Creer <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1919&#150;2000), <span class="occ">campaigner for disabled people's rights</span>, was born on 12 December 1919 at Mosman, near Sydney, Australia, the only son of George Moorfield Hargreaves (1890&#150;1978), soap manufacturer, and his first wife, Gwendoline May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Needham (<i>c</i>.1887&#150;1922/3). His mother was a member of the seafaring Creer family; her cousin Lieutenant Henty Henty-Creer died while commanding a Royal Navy X-craft midget submarine during an attack on the German battleship <i>Tirpitz</i> in Norway on 22 September 1943.<br>
<br>A 2&frac12; pound baby born two months prematurely, Hargreaves was fed with an eye-dropper, bathed in olive oil, and wrapped in cotton wool for the first six weeks of his life. When he was three his mother died. The doctor's advice to his father was that, because Hargreaves had cerebral palsy, he would &#145;never walk, work or wed&#146;  (private information). Hargreaves was looked after by a nurse in Hobart, Tasmania, for two years until his father returned with his second wife. At the age of seven, and after several painful operations, he began proving the doctor wrong. He started walking to Coogee public school&#151;barefoot, because his uncoordinated walking style meant he was wearing out a pair of shoes every week. In 1930 he, his adopted brother John, and his father set sail for England to join their stepmother and her two sons, David and Peter. He spent five years at University School, Southport, and Marlborough College, Liverpool, before leaving school at the age of sixteen.<br>
<br>Hargreaves began work at El-Dor, his father's soap factory in Shrewsbury, in 1935. Starting as a soap packer, he adapted machinery to enable himself to become a qualified soap maker, despite his limited dexterity. On his twenty-first birthday he was put in charge of the works, owing to his father's ill health. The following day the factory was requisitioned to build Spitfire wings. Hargreaves went on to work in the Vickers Armstrong Lancaster bomber factory in Birmingham. During the Second World War, as part of a YMCA travelling theatre, he also entertained troops with his ventriloquism act, Vocis. Trained by George H. Bate, he achieved some success and was a member of the Magic Circle and the British Magical Society. While looking for an assistant for the act he met Mary Bowles (<i>b</i>. 1922), a dressmaker and the daughter of Herbert Vincent Bowles, a chef. They married on 30 June 1945 and became wardens of the YMCA hostel at Kettering. After the birth of their son Brian (1949&#150;2006) they moved to Corby, where their daughter Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1953) was born.<br>
<br>Hargreaves spent three years working for Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks from 1949 until 1952, when his life took an unexpected turn. A friend from YMCA days, Laurie Green, whose own son had cerebral palsy, gave him a leaflet: &#145;Please help Spastics. What is a Spastic? It might have been your child.&#146; Hargreaves recalled his reaction:<blockquote>I went straight around within the hour to Laurie Green's house, and I saw before me a child who was me &hellip; It was a terrible, emotional feeling. Laurie told me that I was the first person with cerebral palsy they had heard of who had made it in life, and please, please could I help? There weren't any people with cerebral palsy in the streets at all &hellip; Why? Because their parents were ashamed of having their children seen&#151;which was appalling. (Hargreaves, 59)</blockquote>As chairman of the newly formed Corby Spastics Group Hargreaves was the first person with cerebral palsy to serve on the executive committee of the National Spastics Society. He also served on the employment committee that created the Sherrards work centre. In 1957 he was asked by the chairman, Ian Dawson-Shepherd, to become industrial liaison officer on a salary of &pound;900 a year, touring the country spreading the message: &#145;Given the right chance, many disabled people could do a good job of work&#146;. In five years he placed over 1500 people with cerebral palsy into their first jobs, and the Ministry of Labour published 10,000 copies of one of his speeches to distribute to disablement advisory committees. His life story was broadcast on BBC radio as <span class="italic">Can You Manage Stairs?</span> in 1959.<br>
<br>In 1962 Hargreaves turned his attention to the limited social opportunities afforded to people with cerebral palsy. He founded the 62 Clubs, self-help groups run by people with cerebral palsy themselves. The range of activities grew from holidays at Woodlarks campsite to a catamaran crossing of the English Channel, from talks about climbing Everest to a hike up Snowdon. Within two years there were thirty-nine clubs in the UK as well as others in Canada, Germany, and Italy. Hargreaves's work gained international recognition and his powerful and entertaining public speaking took him to fourteen countries. He was awarded the queen's silver jubilee medal in 1977 and appointed MBE in 1978.<br>
<br>Hargreaves retired in 1982 but returned to the executive council of the Spastics Society in 1984. He continued to be very involved in the organization, which changed its name, with his blessing, to Scope in 1994. He was also involved in setting up the Handicapped Aid Trust, which made grants of many thousands of pounds to pay for carers for disabled people on holiday. He died at Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, of cancer of the bladder on 3 October 2000 and was cremated at Lytham St Anne's, where he had lived since 1989. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and their two children.<br>
