<span class="headword">Donaldson,  Thomas Leverton</span>  (1795&#150;1885), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 19 October 1795 at 8 Bloomsbury Square, London, the third son in the family of four sons and two daughters (the eldest son died in infancy) of James Donaldson (<i>c</i>.1756&#150;1843), architect and district surveyor, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Andrew Leverton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16537/', "Thomas Leverton")</script>, the architect, was his great-uncle. He was educated at King Edward VI's Grammar School, St Albans.<br>
<br>In 1809 Donaldson went to the Cape of Good Hope to work for Robert Stuart, a merchant, but soon after his arrival he volunteered for the 87th regiment, for an expedition to capture Mauritius. The French surrendered, and as there was no permanent vacancy for him in the regiment, he returned to Britain at the age of sixteen, and became a pupil under his father. In 1815 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied under John Soane, and was awarded the silver medal in 1817.<br>
<br>In 1819 Donaldson set off for the continent, and travelled for five years in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor, measuring and sketching the most important buildings, and developing a great enthusiasm for the antique. Canova, president of the Accademia di San Luca at Rome, liked his design for a temple of victory, and Donaldson was elected a member of that academy in 1822.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain in 1823, Donaldson began to practise as an architect. He married Matilda Georgiana Lingham (<i>d</i>. 1876) in 1825, and they had three sons. Though unsuccessful in the competition for the completion of King's College, Cambridge, in 1825, he won the competition for Holy Trinity Church, South Kensington, with a Gothic design (1826&#150;9). Many buildings were erected from his designs, including the library at University College, London (1848&#150;9), in the classical style, and University Hall (now Dr Williams's Library), Gordon Square (1848&#150;9), his best-known work, in the Tudor Gothic style, and the German Hospital, Hackney (1865). His design for the rebuilding of the Royal Exchange, which burnt down in 1838, was given first place as a design in 1840, but did not win; he also competed unsuccessfully to build the Nelson monument in Trafalgar Square and in 1860 for the memorial to Prince Albert. In addition to his practice as an architect, Donaldson was district surveyor for South Kensington for many years.<br>
<br>Not a major architect, Donaldson was nevertheless a prominent figure in the world of Victorian architecture and is best remembered as the founding father of the Institute of British Architects (later the Royal Institute of British Architects) in 1834. He continued to act as honorary secretary of this professional body until 1839, and then as its foreign secretary for a further twenty years. He devised the motto &#145;Usui civium, decori urbium&#146;, and designed the Mycenean lions medal of the institute. He was awarded the royal gold medal in 1851 and was president of the institute from 1863 to 1864. Donaldson served on the building committee for the Great Exhibition of 1851, and it is thought by some that the official design produced by the committee, which was rejected in favour of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace design, was almost entirely his. He also served as treasurer of the Architectural Publication Society from 1848 to 1860.<br>
<br>In addition to his work towards establishing the professional status of architects through the foundation of the Institute of British Architects, Donaldson is also remembered as the first professor of architecture to be elected to the newly founded chair at University College, London, in 1842. Second only to that established at the Royal Academy in 1768, this chair was established at University College in 1841 at the suggestion of William Inwood, architect. A pioneer in the academic study of architecture, Donaldson had to plan a system of work and to devise his own methods: he divided his subject into architecture as a fine art, which he treated from a historical point of view, and architecture as a science. His lectures were well illustrated with drawings and diagrams, his collection of which passed into the possession of the school. He was described as always dressed in professional black  (Bellot, 265 and n.). On his retirement in 1864 the Donaldson medal was struck to commemorate his services in promoting the study of architecture; two silver impressions of the medal are given annually as prizes at the college. He was a member of the Institut de France and of various other foreign academies of the fine arts.<br>
<br>Donaldson also published extensively, including <span class="italic">Pompeii</span> (1827), <span class="italic">A Collection of the Most Approved Examples of Doorways from Ancient Buildings in Greece and Italy</span> (1833), and <span class="italic">Architectura numismatica, or, Architectural Medals of Classic Antiquity &hellip; Explained</span> (1859).<br>
<br>Donaldson died at his home, 21 Upper Bedford Place, Bloomsbury, London, on 1 August 1885, and was buried five days later at Brompton cemetery. In 1879 the prince of Wales had called him &#145;the father of the institute and of the profession&#146;  (Blutman, 542).<br>
