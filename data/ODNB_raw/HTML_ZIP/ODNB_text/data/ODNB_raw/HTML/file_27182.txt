<span class="headword">Thierry,  Charles Philippe Hippolyte  de</span>  (1793&#150;1864), <span class="occ">self-proclaimed sovereign chief of New Zealand</span>, was the eldest son of Charles Antoine de Thierry and his wife, Mary Louise, the daughter of Antoine Adrien de Laville. He was born in April 1793, probably at Grave, in the Netherlands, where the family found itself having fled France. The revolution had made continued residence there impossible for his father, a French merchant mariner turned equerry at the French court. In November 1794 the family arrived in England, where his father assumed the title of baron. After a peripatetic childhood, Thierry was engaged on two diplomatic missions. He afterwards married Emily Rudge (<i>d</i>. 1856), probably on 8 May 1819 at Gloucester; they had five children. That year, on 26 May, Thierry matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and claimed to have then transferred to Queens' College, Cambridge, but he did not graduate.<br>
<br>At Cambridge in 1820 Thierry met two Maori chiefs with the missionary Thomas Kendall, and then conceived the idea of founding an empire in New Zealand. Kendall returned to New Zealand and in 1822 purportedly bought 40,000 acres near Hokianga for Thierry, who based on this purchase a claim to all the land from Auckland to the north cape of the North Island. He applied to Earl Bathurst, then secretary of state, for confirmation of this grant, but was met with the response that New Zealand was not a British possession. He then tried the Dutch and French governments without success.<br>
<br>Proceeding to form a private company to carry out his plans, Thierry returned from France in 1826, fleeing from creditors, and set up an office in London, where he slowly acquired some little support. In 1827 he went to the United States to enlarge his sphere of action, and thence by the West Indian islands to Panama, where he expressed interest in cutting a canal. In 1835 he arrived in Tahiti. Here he issued a proclamation asserting his intention to establish his authority as sovereign chief of New Zealand by force. This threat carried some weight, since, although opposed by the British consul, he had recruited a military force in Tahiti. In 1837 he arrived in New South Wales, where he recruited about sixty colonists and sailed in the <i>Nimrod</i> to the Bay of Islands. Having summoned a meeting of chiefs at Mangunga, he explained his schemes and his title to the land he claimed; the chiefs refused to recognize his title, and showed alarm at his statement that he expected his brother to follow him with 500 persons. He also made a formal address to the white residents of New Zealand, in the course of which he announced that he came as neither an invader nor a despot, but to govern within the bounds of his own territories, and proceeded to expound a scheme of settlement and administration which showed him both communistic and paternal. He stated that he had brought with him a surgeon to attend the poor, and a tutor and governess to educate the settlers' children with his own. But, despite this solemn bravado, Thierry and his party had supplies for only two or three weeks, and his potential threat to British interest was quickly discounted. Ultimately, through the intervention of a missionary, two of the chiefs agreed to grant Thierry some land near Hokianga on condition he repudiate his larger claim. The rest of his party dispersed after rioting, and thus his grand scheme ended in failure, although he continued to send inflated accounts to France indicating success.<br>
<br>New Zealand was proclaimed a British colony in the treaty of Waitangi in 1840, thus thwarting Thierry's ambitions of a French colony. In 1850 he left for the California goldfields, then spent two years on the French consulate staff in Honolulu before returning to Auckland, where his wife died in 1856. By 1860 he had begun to achieve some financial success, but he died suddenly in Auckland on 8 July 1864.<br>
