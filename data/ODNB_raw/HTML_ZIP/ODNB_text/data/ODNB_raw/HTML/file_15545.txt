<span class="headword">Kilvert,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1650), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the brother of Roger Kilvert, a wine-importing Spanish merchant, but their parents are unknown. Kilvert married Margaret Duppa on 20 February 1614 at St Christopher-le-Stocks, London. They had a son, Robert Richard Kilvert, who was born in 1615. In 1639 Kilvert was said to be living in his brother's house in St Martin's Lane, London.<br>
<br>Kilvert's education is unknown, but by the 1630s he was a lawyer soliciting cases in the Star Chamber and the court of high commission. Throughout his career Kilvert was exposed to attempted bribery and was confronted with allegations of corruption. In the eyes of contemporaries he was bold and without scruples. With reference to his past role in the court of high commission a pamphlet of 1642 claimed: &#145;Yet even in that Court he was found too corrupt, too libidinous, too treacherous; many Articles were exhibited against him and at last he was reiected as a person infamous and scandalous to Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Vintners Answer to some Scandalous Pamphlets Published (as is Supposed) by Richard Kilvert</span>, 1642). On the other hand Kilvert enjoyed the trust of those in power. He was in contact with the secretary of state, Sir Francis Windebank, the lawyer Sir John Lambe, and James Hamilton, third marquess of Hamilton. Among his closest acquaintances was Archbishop Laud.<br>
<br>Kilvert was involved in several significant cases. In April 1621 he informed the House of Lords of the &#145;many corruptions&#146; of Sir John Bennet, MP for Oxford University, and promised further evidence  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/120.107). The Lord Chancellor, who was accused along with Bennet, made large offers to Kilvert to desist from his charges, but Kilvert informed the House of Lords about the attempted bribery. In the proceedings against John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, in 1636 Kilvert played an important role as informer. He petitioned the king to impose a great fine on the bishop on the grounds of evidence brought against him in the court of Star Chamber and collected evidence which aimed at casting doubt on the bishop's religious and political loyalty, and his personal integrity with allegations of fraud and corruption  (ibid., 16/362.11). Williams counter-attacked resurrecting an old accusation of perjury against Kilvert and accusing him of living in adultery. In an earlier letter to Secretary Sir John Coke he had voiced his distrust of Kilvert, who &#145;appears&#146; to have drawn &#145;the petition and manageth all this business against me, which I pray God may receive such a determination as that his Majesty's service in these parts do not suffer by the favour this felon hath found&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cowper MSS</span>, 2.153). In 1638 Charles I employed Kilvert as solicitor in endeavouring to levy a fine of &pound;10,000 on the bishop, with &pound;1500 of the fine to go to Kilvert, and Williams was further accused of having tried to corrupt Kilvert and procuring several witnesses to swear falsely in depositions against him.<br>
<br>In 1637, at a time when the vintners were under increasing pressure from the crown for a new imposition of duty on imported wine, Kilvert and the marquess of Hamilton contacted William Abell, alderman and master of the Vintners' Company. Threatening legal action against the vintners, Kilvert and Hamilton pressured Abell into persuading the company to agree to the new tax in return for the farm of the issuing of wine licences for taverns throughout England and Wales at &pound;7000 a year, which increased its obligations to the crown to &pound;37,000 a year. Kilvert received &pound;1000 for his services and a grant of &pound;500 a year out of the farm. Part of the arrangement with the Vintners' Company was the so called &#145;medium&#146;, which obliged the vintners to take from the merchants a set quantity of wines at set prices. Kilvert, however, obtained an order from the king to discharge the vintners from the medium for the future. He also accompanied those company members who rode about to settle the imposition in the country. According to one account he &#145;as from the King's mouth took the Boldnesse to treat with all men, and in very imperious terms&#146;. When &#145;all his intimation from the King&#146; failed he threatened Star Chamber action  (<span class="italic">Vintners Answer</span>).<br>
<br>When the wine project began to fail, as many would not pay the new duties, recriminations were voiced from many sides. Parliament, hostile to monopolies, resolved in March 1641 that the new duty was illegal and that Abell and Kilvert were responsible both for its creation and execution. In September 1641 Kilvert was bailed. A number of pamphlets gave derisive accounts of Abell and Kilvert plotting to obtain the monopoly for their own benefit. In 1641 Kilvert defended his role in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A reply to a most untrue relation made and set forth in print by certaine vintners in excuse of their wine project</span>. His key argument was that the vintners had contrived the wine project out of a desire to enrich themselves and that he was not present when they agreed the project in November 1637. Responding to the testimonies of those involved in the wine project before a committee for the House of Commons, which were printed in <span class="italic">Die Mercurii</span> on 21 July 1641, Kilvert wrote,<blockquote>So that now this whole business being found to be the work of the Company, both in the creation and execution, Master Kilvert is most confident of the justice of the Honorable House of Commons that they will not punish him for the Vintners offence, there being no Petitioner or complaint against him, other then the recrimination of the Counsell of Alderman, Abell, and the Vintners. (Kilvert, <span class="italic">Reply</span>)</blockquote>In the end the main punishment fell on Abell, and Kilvert managed to escape scot-free. He was at liberty in December 1643 and seems to have lived comfortably in his house in St Martin's Lane until his death on 3 July 1650.<br>
