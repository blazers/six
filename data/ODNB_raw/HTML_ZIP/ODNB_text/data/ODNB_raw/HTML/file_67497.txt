<span class="headword">Cammell,  Donald Seton</span>  (1934&#150;1996), <span class="occ">film-maker</span>, was born on 17 January 1934 at the Outlook Tower, Castle Hill, Edinburgh, the son of Charles Richard Cammell (1890&#150;1968), author, and his second wife, Iona Katherine Lamont Macdonald (1903&#150;1981), daughter of David Macdonald, medical practitioner, and his wife, Anne Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cameron. Charles Cammell had inherited a large fortune from the Cammell Laird shipbuilding company and was able to devote himself to writing. He later became acquainted with the notorious Aleister Crowley, publishing his biography in 1951. Cammell's father was later to observe that: &#145;There is something &#147;fey&#148; about Donald's personality, which my wife believes to be due to the fact that a Highland friend of ours &hellip; immediately after Donald's birth, took him in her arms and sung to him Hebridean faery-songs&#146;  (Cammell, 87). Cammell also showed an early gift for drawing and possessed so clear an idea of perspective that the artist John Duncan, a family friend, maintained that it proved that he had learned the skill in a previous incarnation. Cammell's artistic talent was such that his father had exhibited his work at the Royal Drawing Society from the age of eight. During the early years of the Second World War, Cammell and his brother David (<i>b</i>. 1937) lived in the highlands of Scotland, Cammell attending a preparatory school in Fort Augustus. However, in the winter of 1942&#150;3 homesickness resulted in his returning to London, where the family had moved in 1935. He then attended Shrewsbury House School, near Thames Ditton, and Westminster School, before moving to the Byam Shaw School of Art from where, in 1954, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy. Two years earlier he had travelled in Italy, where he received lessons from Pietro Annigoni.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Cammell set himself up as a portrait painter in studios at Flood Street, Chelsea. His 1953 portrait of the marquess of Dufferin and Ava was judged society portrait of the year. Cammell was also enjoying a busy social life as part of the &#145;Chelsea set&#146;, a mixture of public schoolboys and d&eacute;butantes who indulged their tastes for parties and sexual excess, and who had a fascination with working-class crime and violence. There was nothing particularly new in this; members of the British upper classes had long been excited by being close, but not too close, to working-class criminality. In Cammell's case this fascination was an integral part of his major artistic achievement: the film <span class="italic">Performance</span>. Another key element of the film, sex, is also crucial to understanding Cammell. Extremely handsome, Cammell had no difficulty in attracting a series of beautiful women to his studio; he also developed a taste for threesomes. On 30 August 1954 he married the actress Mary Antippas 
    (formerly Maria Mastrantones; <i>b</i>. 1927/8)
  , a divorcee, and daughter of Anthony Antippas, a company secretary. The marriage produced a son, Antony, in 1959, but ended soon thereafter. Cammell then left London and headed for New York; he never resided permanently in Britain again.<br>
<br>It appears that Cammell had become disenchanted with life as a society portraitist and was looking to adopt other approaches to art. During the late 1950s he met Deborah Dixon, a Texan model, with whom he travelled to Paris in the early 1960s. There he again took up figurative painting, although he now eschewed formal society portraits for something a little more flexible. However, by the mid-1960s his disillusionment with painting was such that he abandoned it for a new medium: film. His first script was for <span class="italic">The Touchables</span> (1968); he then went on to write the original script for <span class="italic">Duffy</span> (1968), a crime film starring James Coburn as an American hippie who assists two brothers to rob their father. The films, as envisaged by Cammell, contained elements of violence, sex, and rock music, but his vision never made it to the screen. Cammell's experiences with both <span class="italic">The Touchables</span> and <span class="italic">Duffy</span> were distinctly unhappy. The directors of both films delivered finished products totally at odds with Cammell's original ideas. Indeed, his dissatisfaction with <span class="italic">Duffy</span> became so intense that he was eventually thrown off the set. It was apparent that what Cammell craved was control, and the only way he could achieve this was by directing his next project himself. He began shooting in the summer of 1968.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Performance</span>, which Cammell co-directed with Nicolas Roeg, is the tale of a gangster, Chas Devlin (played by James Fox), who is on the run from some of his associates and hides out in the home of reclusive rock star Turner (Mick Jagger) and his entourage. The key themes of the film&#151;sexuality, class, violence, and identity&#151;are explored as a fusion occurs between the world of East End crime and a flourishing youth culture, exemplified by rock music. The film also contains a liberal amount of references to magic and eastern mysticism. <span class="italic">Performance</span> was soon recognized as a minor classic, and the filming of it became surrounded by myths of the excesses said to have taken place on set and by stories of the tensions that developed between the actors. The charming but manipulative Cammell encouraged these tensions in the belief that they would produce a more truthful performance. When Warner Bros. executives saw Cammell's original version of the film, they were horrified. The copious amounts of sex, violence, and drug-taking, not to mention the sight of dirty bathwater in one scene, was too much for them, and they insisted that the film be edited in Los Angeles. <span class="italic">Performance</span> was released, to a mixed reaction, in the USA in the summer of 1970 and, to good reviews, in Britain in January 1971.<br>
<br>What really should have been only the beginning of a successful career for Cammell as a director was, in truth, its pinnacle. The remainder of his career was taken up with battles with studios, and littered with abandoned projects. His only other films were <span class="italic">Demon Seed</span> (1977), <span class="italic">White of the Eye</span> (1986), and <span class="italic">Wild Side</span> (1995), none of which approached the success of <span class="italic">Performance</span>. Nevertheless <span class="italic">Performance</span> alone was both a key film of the 1960s and a landmark in British cinema. Many film-makers more prolific than Cammell would have been happy with these achievements. In 1978 he married, secondly, China Kong (<i>b</i>. 1960). He had been commissioned to direct another film when, on 24 April 1996, he shot himself through the head at the home he shared with his wife at Lookout Mountain, Hollywood. Cammell, who had for some time been interested in suicide, aimed the shot so that death would not be instantaneous, but painless and pleasurable. He remained conscious for some forty-five minutes, during which time he asked for a mirror with which he might view his death. Among his last words were: &#145;Can you see the picture of Borges now?&#146;, a reference to the death of Turner in <span class="italic">Performance</span>, this too the result of a gunshot to the head.<br>
