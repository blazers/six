<span class="headword">Bushell,  Stephen Wootton</span>  (1844&#150;1908), <span class="occ">physician and art historian</span>, born on 28 July 1844 at Woodnesborough, near Sandwich, Kent, was the third son of William Bushell, a farmer, and his wife, Sarah Frances Wootton. After education at Tunbridge Wells School and at Grange Court, Chigwell, he studied medicine at Guy's Hospital, and in 1866 graduated MB of the University of London, where he won several scholarships and gold medals. He was appointed house surgeon at Guy's Hospital in 1866 and in the following year became resident medical officer to Bethlem Royal Hospital. In 1868 he went to Peking (Beijing), as physician to the British legation there. Bushell married on 26 November 1874 Florence Jane (<i>b</i>. 1851/2), daughter of Robert Mathews, a surgeon; they had one son.<br>
<br>Bushell became a considerable connoisseur of Chinese art, architecture, books, and coins. He studied the Chinese language and Chinese literature, and in the early 1870s travelled through the country with the photographer John Thomson, collaborating with him to produce a collection of photographs of Peking architecture and artefacts which is now in the Oriental Museum at the University of Durham. He also bought Chinese ceramics for A. W. Franks, the director of the British Museum, who presented his collection to the British Museum in 1876. In 1882&#150;3 Bushell bought for the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum). His purchases for Franks and for South Kensington became the nuclei of both museums' Chinese collections. Bushell retired from his post, owing to ill health, in 1900. The services which he rendered to the Zongli yamen and other Chinese government departments had received formal acknowledgement in 1894, and in 1897 he had been made a CMG.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Bushell devoted himself to writing on Chinese art and archaeology, and quickly won recognition as the leading authority of his day on Chinese ceramics. Bringing to the subject both his scientific training and his experience as a connoisseur, as well as an adequate grasp of the Chinese language, he was able to study, and in many cases publish in translation, classic Chinese works on arts and handicrafts. These publications included <span class="italic">Porcelain of Different Dynasties</span> (1908), a reproduction with translation of a sixteenth-century Chinese collector's album with coloured illustrations (the original by Xiang Yuanpian was destroyed by fire in 1887, and the illustrations, taken from a copy, are therefore of questionable value); Bushell had in 1886 published a translation of the text of this album in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Peking Oriental Society</span>. His <span class="italic">Chinese Pottery and Porcelain</span> (published posthumously in 1910) was a translation of the classic <span class="italic">Tao shuo</span> (&#145;Speaking of pottery&#146;), and ranked in significance with Stanilaus Julien's translation of <span class="italic">Jingdezhen tao lu</span> (1856). <span class="italic">Jade in China</span> (1906), an illustrated catalogue of the Heber Reginald Bishop collection (now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York) also included translations of <span class="italic">Yu shuo</span> (&#145;Discussion of jade&#146;) by Tang Rongzuo, and <span class="italic">Yuzuo tu</span> (&#145;Illustrations of the manufacture of jade&#146;) by Li Shichuan. Other works by Bushell include <span class="italic">Oriental Ceramic Art</span>, a description of the W. T. Waters collection in Baltimore, published in ten richly illustrated volumes in 1897, followed by a separate edition in 1899, and a catalogue of the J. Pierpont Morgan collection of Chinese porcelain in the Metropolitan Museum of New York, which he prepared with W. M. Laffan in 1907. He also wrote <span class="italic">Chinese Art</span> (1904), a general introduction to the field, and edited Cosmo Monkhouse's book <span class="italic">Chinese Porcelain</span> (1901).<br>
<br>Bushell died on 19 September 1908 at his house, Ravensholt, Mount Park, Northolt. He was survived by his wife and son. As a contemporary observer of late nineteenth-century Chinese art, he was outstanding; his accounts of the kilns at Jingdezhen of that period are invaluable, and his catalogues are still important reference works on the later Qing porcelains. His translations may not be unquestioned, but they offered models for the scholarly handling of his subject. Bushell's own collection of Chinese artefacts was probably inherited by his family: in 1975 a granddaughter, Dorothy Bushell, presented a gift of twenty-five pieces to the Victoria and Albert Museum; the remainder of her collection was donated to the National Trust and is held at Beningbrough Hall, Yorkshire.<br>
