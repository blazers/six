<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallis <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Campbell]</span>,  Tryphosa Jane</span>  (1774&#150;1848), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of the provincial performers Jane Wallis (1750&#150;1785) and Fielding Wallis (1754&#150;1817), whose father, Revd Thomas Wallis, was rector of Boho and Templecarn, in counties Fermanagh and Donegal, Ireland. The eldest of eight children, she was born on 11 January 1774 at Richmond, Yorkshire, where her maternal grandmother was associated with the management of the theatre. She appeared as a child in Dublin at the Smock Alley and Crow Street theatres with her parents. The family returned to England, where she continued performing, and after her mother's death in 1785 she was essentially adopted by Lord and Lady Loughborough (later earl and countess of Rosslyn). Through their influence she made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 10 January 1789, as Sigismunda in James Thomson's <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span>. The <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> described her as exhibiting &#145;great marks of feeling and sensibility&#146;. The following season she gained an engagement in Bath, and played Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> for her first appearance (17 October 1790).<br>
<br>Tryphosa Wallis was thereafter seen as Lucile in <span class="italic">False Appearances</span>, Indiana in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, Calista in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, Maria in <span class="italic">The Citizen</span>, and Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>. She performed in both Bath and Bristol until 1794, and became a great favourite. On 4 March 1794 she delivered an effusive speech at a farewell benefit and was presented with a medallion from the ladies and gentlemen of Bath, as a &#145;small tribute to her private virtue and public merit&#146;.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1794, as &#145;Miss Wallis&#146; from Bath, she reappeared at Covent Garden, where she was engaged for three years at &pound;18 a week, and played Imogen in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>. She repeated many of the prominent characters in which she had been seen in Bath, including Juliet, Calista, Beatrice, and Cordelia, and played several original parts, of which the most considerable were Georgina in Hannah Cowley's <span class="italic">Town Before You</span>, Julia in Miles Peter Andrews's <span class="italic">Mysteries of the Castle</span>, Lady Danvers in Frederick Reynolds's <span class="italic">Fortune's Fool</span>, and Miss Dorillon in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Wives as they Were and Maids as they Are</span>. Although the critics were relatively complimentary, there are some hints that puffs advertising her performances were exaggerated in their praise. The <span class="italic">Secret History of the Green Rooms</span> (1795) noted that she could justly deliver &#145;deserted love, plaintive melancholy, and soft friendship &hellip; all beyond these nature has denied and art will scarcely supply them&#146;. Roach's <span class="italic">Authentic Memoirs of the Green Room</span> (1796) was harsher: &#145;it is not the approbation of a <i>lerd</i> or <i>lady</i>, nor being engaged at an exorbitant salary, can make John Bull see more merit than there actually is&#146;.<br>
<br>Tryphosa Wallis's final performance at Covent Garden was on 22 May 1797. She then appeared for a short time at Newcastle and Edinburgh before marrying James Elijah Campbell of the 3rd regiment of the foot guards, at Gladsmuir, East Lothian, in June or July. On her marriage she left the stage for a time.<br>
<br>On 20 February 1813, as &#145;Mrs Campbell late Miss Wallis&#146;, she reappeared at Covent Garden, playing the title role in Garrick's <span class="italic">Isabella</span> but she lost her nerve and was a failure. The <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span> (1813) noted her &#145;matronly appearance and deportment&#146;, commented that her face was expressive of the amiable and domestic passions, but acknowledged she was &#145;unequal to the successful personation of the higher characters of drama&#146;. Despite this faint praise, she reappeared at Bath in April and was employed there for the following season, but she never recovered her lost ground. After this final engagement she retired permanently from the stage, aged thirty. Contemporary biographers mention her as a good daughter, a good sister, and a good wife.<br>
<br>Tryphosa Jane Campbell and her husband had at least seven children. One daughter, Charlotte Eliza Jane, died in 1826, and her will reveals the names of her brothers: James, John, Fielding, and Hugh. The deaths of two other daughters, Jane and Mary, aged twenty and seventeen, were reported in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of March 1833. The same announcement mentioned that their father was, by that time, a captain in the Royal Navy. He had evidently died by the time of his wife's death, on 29 December 1848, as her tombstone at All Saints' in Edmonton, Middlesex, describes her as a widow.<br>
