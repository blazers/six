<span class="headword">Colville, Sir  James, of Easter Wemyss</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Colville of Ochiltree (<i>d</i>. 1513) and his wife, Elizabeth Arnot (<i>d</i>. in or before 1528). Though associated with his parents in tenancies of crown lands in 1505, he was probably still a minor when his father died at Flodden. Two kinsmen then occupied the house of Ochiltree, claiming this was &#145;for the weile of the said Elizabeth and James, and that utheris thair ill willaris suld nocht have entres tharin&#146;  (Hannay, 3). Colville was appointed to his father's office of director of chancery before 31 October 1518. Having agreed to replace Robert Barton as comptroller, he tried to back out, but finally took up office on 13 August 1525. His comptrollership was marked by financial crises and threats of resignation; despite close association with the Douglas-dominated regime, he survived its fall in 1528 and was made custumar of Edinburgh. On 10 August that year he agreed with the treasurer to supply the royal household for the following year, but in February 1529 he petitioned to be released from office and was replaced by Barton.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1529 James V confirmed Colville as director of chancery for life and appointed him to the council, with a place in exchequer and session. On 13 December 1530 he exchanged his barony of Ochiltree with Sir James Finnart for the barony of Easter Wemyss in Fife. His judicial position as a lord of session was made permanent in May 1532 when he became a senator of the new college of justice. He was knighted between then and June 1533 and was one of the commissioners sent to Newcastle to negotiate the truce with England.<br>
<br>When Barton's second term as comptroller left him ruined financially, James V turned again to Colville, who took office on 9 September 1530. Under his management the crown revenues increased, though, as James reached adulthood, so did spending on the royal household. The position deteriorated after the king's marriages in 1537&#150;8, and by September 1538 Colville's excess expenditure had reached &pound;2667, which was to have been repaid from the tax for the king's expenses in France. Instead Colville was dismissed following the revelation that he had assisted Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie, charged with treason in 1528. Himself charged with treason, Colville fled to England, but he returned in July 1539 to submit to the king's will. On being threatened with imprisonment in August 1540 he again went to England, where he died before 4 December. On 14 March 1541 sentence of forfeiture was pronounced against him and his heirs. His barony of Easter Wemyss and other lands were annexed to the crown, along with lands owned by others who had fallen victim to James V's vengeance or greed. After the king's death the forfeiture was rescinded on 12 December 1543, and on 1 February 1545 his illegitimate brother William Colville, commendator of Culross, was appointed comptroller.<br>
<br>James Colville was twice married. His first wife, Alison Bruce (<i>d</i>. in or before 1536), is said to have been a daughter of Sir David Bruce of Clackmannan. He married second (by contract dated 21 May 1536) Margaret Forrester (<i>d</i>. in or before 1562), sister of David Forrester of Garden. He had a son and a daughter from each marriage. The elder son, James Colville, who succeeded to Easter Wemyss on reversal of the forfeiture, was the father of the first Lord Colville of Culross. The younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6006/', "Alexander Colville")</script>, succeeded his uncle William as commendator of Culross in 1567. There were also two illegitimate sons, one of whom, Robert Colville of Cleish (<i>d</i>. 1560), was the ancestor of the lords Colvill of Ochiltree.<br>
