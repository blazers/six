<span class="headword">Oudney,  Walter</span>  (1790&#150;1824), <span class="occ">naval surgeon and traveller in Africa</span>, was born in December 1790 to humble parents, in Edinburgh. With some medical knowledge he became a surgeon's mate on a man-of-war, was appointed assistant surgeon and then surgeon in 1810, and was stationed in the East Indies. When peace was declared he returned on half pay to Edinburgh to join his mother and sisters. He attended classes at the university, graduated MD on 1 August 1817, and set up in private practice.<br>
<br>The course of the Niger was one of the most contentious questions of African geography and, after attempts to solve it by exploration from west Africa had failed, it was proposed that it be approached from Tripoli, where the British consul-general Hanmer Warrington had established cordial relations with the ruling Turkish pasha, Yusuf Karamanl&#305;. After Joseph Ritchie's attempt using the new route in 1818 had ended in disaster, and when his companion George Francis Lyon had refused to make a second attempt, the Foreign Office was looking for suitable replacements. James Robinson Scott, a former lecturer in botany at the University of Edinburgh, recommended Oudney, whom he considered an accomplished surgeon and botanist. Oudney had become a member of the Wernerian Society and had studied chemistry and natural history, hoping to become a lecturer in botany at Edinburgh University, but he expressed himself keen to go to Africa. In 1821 he learnt that he had been appointed leader of the expedition with Hugh Clapperton, a naval officer on half pay, also from Edinburgh, who was appointed assistant at Oudney's request.<br>
<br>Oudney and Clapperton arrived in Tripoli in October 1821, to be joined by Dixon Denham, who had volunteered to join the expedition and had managed to get himself appointed its leader over both Oudney, the original leader, and Clapperton, his senior in service rank. Oudney, who had volunteered for a scientific expedition, found himself appointed permanent vice-consul at Bornu, and was charged with exerting a diplomatic presence to increase British standing; however, he also helped to open up new areas to trade, and to further exploration and the collection of natural historical specimens. The party was acrimonious and divided, though its relations with the hosts and guides were good. On 7 April 1822 it arrived in Murzuq in Fezzan, where it was delayed after finding that no preparations had been made for the expedition; Oudney and Clapperton explored the neighbourhood, and finally in November 1822, with the assurance of a military escort, the group set off southwards across the desert. Denham apparently despised his companions for their humble backgrounds. Oudney found himself required by Denham to investigate unfounded allegations about Clapperton's sexual behaviour. In February they reached Kuka (later Kukawa), the capital of Bornu, on Lake Chad. Here they were detained by the ruler Sheik Muhammad el Kanemi, who was afraid for their safety. Eventually Oudney and Clapperton left for Kano on 14 December 1823. In the extremely cold weather Oudney, who had been in poor health since arriving at Kuka, caught pneumonia; he died at Katagum in the Sudan on 12 January 1824 and was buried there.<br>
<br>Oudney was said to have been of middle height and slightly built, pale and grave. He was enterprising and determined, and was sympathetic to Africans. The account of the expedition was published by Denham in 1826 and, with Oudney dead and Clapperton in Africa, he was able to appropriate to himself most of the credit for the expedition which had very considerably advanced the state of geographical knowledge of the area as well as establishing cordial relations between the local rulers and Britain, and promising new avenues for trade. The Niger question, however, remained unsolved: Oudney's own (erroneous) theory was that it must terminate in the lakes of Nupe (which he called Nyffe). Some of Oudney's mineralogical notes and some geographical information are included in Denham's <span class="italic">Narrative</span> and some hundreds of his natural history specimens were brought back. None the less his part in the expedition was circumscribed by chronic illness and curtailed by his early death, and he is little remembered.<br>
