<span class="headword">Starley,  James</span>  (1831&#150;1881), <span class="occ">bicycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 21 April 1831 at Woodbine Cottage, Albourne, Sussex, the fourth of five children of Daniel Starley (1804&#150;1856), a farmer, and his wife, Ann Stenning (1800&#150;1852). He began working on his father's farm when he was only nine but did not find agricultural labour to his liking so ran away to London, where he found work as a trainee gardener with a Mrs Bower at Lewisham. While there his ability in mending clocks and sewing machines in his spare time attracted the attention of John Penn, an eminent marine engineer. Penn persuaded Starley to become his gardener and, observing at close hand his mechanical skill over two years, encouraged his friend, Josiah Turner, a midland businessman and partner in Newton Wilson, engineers, in Holborn, London, to employ him.<br>
<br>Starley's career with the London firm began with repairing and making minor improvements in sewing machines, especially in improving the treadle mechanism, and during this time he took out a patent on a machine of his own invention, the European. Turner was quick to recognize Starley's talent and, at the former's suggestion, both broke away from Newton Wilson and moved to Coventry where they formed the Coventry Sewing Machine Company in 1857. Starley was appointed foreman of the new venture and he continued to manufacture the European with the help of four skilled men. Over a number of years he invented and patented many kinds of sewing machines, including the Godiva, the Express, and the Swiftsure. At the end of the 1860s the firm began to face competition from cheaper imports and Turner and Starley actively sought alternative products. Inspiration came from Turner's nephew, Rowley, who after seeing an exhibition of velocipedes in France, obtained an order for 400 and persuaded his uncle and Starley to produce them. So successful was this venture that the firm changed its name to the Coventry Machinists Company.<br>
<br>The first bicycle produced was the C Spring and Step machine, or the Coventry Model, whose principal selling feature lay in its curved spring, its small rear wheel, and a step for mounting. This was followed by the Ariel bicycle which was developed jointly with William Hillman, a former employee. From then onwards new inventions and subsequent improvements followed in quick succession. Among Starley's improvements were advances in spoke technology. The intention was to develop lighter cycles and he initially experimented with spokes made of brass and then of steel strips, before moving on to hairpin wire spokes. These innovations culminated in the Tangent wheel in 1874, which had spokes set aslant, allowing it to be set at different tensions.<br>
<br>Amid this activity Starley ceased to be a partner in the Coventry Machinists Company and set up on his own in St John Street, Coventry. However, he continued to make the Ariel bicycle as well as sewing machines (including the well-known Europa model). Subsequently he entered into partnership with Borthwick Smith, and the firm of Smith and Starley was formed and opened for business in St Agnes Street in Coventry's Cheylesmore district, where production of the Ariel was refined, including the development of a side saddle mounting for ladies. Starley's agile mind was always active and in the later 1870s he produced a series of further inventions. The first of these was the chain driven, single-drive Coventry Lever Tricycle which proved extremely popular. The initial steering of the machine, patented in 1876, was tiller driven, but this was replaced early on with a rack-and-pinion device. Other developments included the Royal Salvo cycle with its differential gears (1877), followed three years later by the Compressor, a folding bicycle. Other new products included the Meteor cycle, as well as his masterpiece, the Salvo quadricycle, which entranced Queen Victoria when she encountered one on the Isle of Wight. In 1881, Starley presented the queen with two tricycles and in return was presented with a watch.<br>
<br>Starley married Ann Todd (1826&#150;1900), a sewing maid five years his senior, at the Union Chapel, Greenwich, on 22 September 1853. They had three sons, James, John Marshall, and William, all of whom joined the cycle trade. His nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48208/', "John Kemp Starley")</script>, also lived with the family and learned the business with him. Starley died from liver cancer at his home in Upper Well Street, Coventry, on 17 June 1881, and was buried in Coventry cemetery on the 21st. Three years later a monument was erected to his memory in Coventry's Queen's Road. Although his inventions did not make him a wealthy man, Starley's achievement was to make bicycles popular and capable of general use; his business helped make Coventry the centre of the UK cycle trade.<br>
