<span class="headword">Eadburh</span> <span class="st"> [St Eadburh, Eadburga]</span>  (921<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;951<span class="mult">x</span>3), <span class="occ">Benedictine nun</span>, was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8514/', "King Edward the Elder")</script> and his third wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52307/', "Eadgifu")</script>. She entered Nunnaminster, Winchester, which had been founded by her grandmother Queen Ealhswith, at the age of three and remained there until her death in her thirtieth year on 15 June. The main source for her is the Latin life, written by Osbert of Clare in the early twelfth century though probably drawing upon earlier written materials which were utilized by other post-conquest writers such as William of Malmesbury and the anonymous author of a Middle English life. Her activities were concentrated within the confines of Nunnaminster and her claims to sanctity rested on her charity and humility, manifested in such incidents as her rising in the night secretly to clean the shoes of the other sisters or to pray at the nearby church of St Peter, Colebrook Street. Her presence was important for increasing the wealth and endowments of Nunnaminster, and an estate at All Cannings, Wiltshire, which is said to have been obtained from King Edward by her intercession (though her probable dates suggest she would have been too young to do this in person), was one of Nunnaminster's major possessions in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. However, an estate at Droxford, Hampshire, granted to her by her half-brother King &AElig;thelstan did not remain in the nunnery's possession; the charter recording the grant is the only record of her outside hagiographical tradition.<br>
<br>Eadburh's recognition as a saint allowed her patronage on behalf of Nunnaminster to continue after her death. The translation of her body on 18 July from the nunnery cemetery to burial by the high altar in the church cannot be dated precisely, but is likely to have occurred in the 960s. Probably in the following decade, her remains were transferred to a silver shrine, with Bishop &AElig;thelwold of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 984) officiating. The occasion of the second translation was probably the rebuilding of the original timber church of Nunnaminster in stone, as revealed by modern excavations. Her cult seems to have enjoyed considerable popularity in Winchester in the later Saxon period and there seems to have been some rivalry with that of Swithun. Pershore Abbey subsequently claimed that it had purchased some of Eadburh's relics from an abbess of Nunnaminster in the late tenth or the eleventh century. But it is possible that the St Eadburh culted at Pershore and at Bicester Priory, which also claimed to possess relics of her, may in fact have been an earlier Mercian saint, or saints, of the same name, who by the twelfth century had become confused with the better-known Eadburh of Nunnaminster.<br>
