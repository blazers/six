<span class="headword">Kymer,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1463), <span class="occ">dean of Salisbury and physician</span>, is first noticed in university records as principal of Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1411, a post he still held in 1414. He received his MA in 1412, and was in that year senior proctor of the university. His DM was awarded about 1423 and he was bachelor of civil law by 1433. He was elected university chancellor on 10 December 1431 and had resigned by March 1434. During that time, he rented a school from University College. Elected chancellor again in February 1447, he resigned on 11 May 1453. As chancellor, he resided in Durham College in March 1449, in Lincoln College in July 1450 and January 1451, and in Coventry Hall in June and July 1452.<br>
<br>Some sources say Kymer married before 1420, but left his wife so as to be able to take holy orders. He came to hold numerous livings, starting with Lutterworth in Leicestershire, and was successively treasurer and dean of Salisbury, where he died on 16 May 1463, and was buried in the cathedral; his effigy survives in the window of the south transept. His will, dated 14 October 1462, was proved on 12 July 1463 and shows him a wealthy and generous man.<br>
<br>In 1423 Kymer appears to have migrated from Oxford to London. There, he joined forces with university-educated physicians and learned surgeons to form a <i>Comminalte</i> (&#145;commonalty&#146;) for the regulation and education of medical practitioners, modelled perhaps on the inns of court or on one of the medical licensing bodies associated with urban universities on the continent. It was to be governed by a rector of physicians (<i>rector medicorum</i>), the first being Kymer himself. The ordinances of the <i>Comminalte</i> were presented to the mayor and aldermen of the City of London and were granted on 15 May 1423. Kymer's associates were the physician John Somerset, medical bachelor Thomas Southwell, and surgeons John Harwe and Thomas Morstede. On 10 September 1424 the <i>Comminalte</i> judged a legal case, when Harwe and others were charged with incompetence by a patient, William Forest. Kymer presided and found for the defendants, ruling that malign astrological influences had caused Forest's misfortune. By 10 November 1424 the organization had faded from the London scene.<br>
<br>Kymer's only surviving medical writing dates from 1424, a regimen of health for Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, which is dated 6 March of that year and was written in Hainault, Flanders. The document, which survives in a single fifteenth-century manuscript  (BL, Sloane MS 4, pp. 63&#150;102), has twenty-six short chapters, dealing in detail with the duke's mode of living. The table of contents and two chapters, largely on the ill effects of the duke's sexual appetite, were printed by T. Hearne in <span class="italic">Liber niger Scaccarii</span> (2.550&#150;59). In 1456 Kymer was one of several physicians and others to obtain a licence to practise alchemy from Henry VI. His associates included William Hatteclyffe, John Faceby, John Kirkeby, and Wolfard Koer. The outcome of their enterprise is not known, but Thomas Norton, in his <span class="italic">Ordinal of Alchemy</span> (<i>c</i>.1490), mentions that Kymer had written a work on alchemy, now lost. Duke Humphrey's famous gift of books to Oxford University seems to have been made at least in part on Kymer's advice. His first gift, in 1439 of 120 books, was delivered by Kymer himself. Kymer owned a considerable collection of medical books, including Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 362, which includes a copy of John Gaddesden's <span class="italic">Rosa anglica</span> with works by other medical authors, including Bernard de Gordon. This book was copied by Kymer's own scribe, Hermann Zurke of Greifswald, Mecklenburg.<br>
