</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McAdam,  John Loudon</span>  (1756&#150;1836), <span class="occ">builder and administrator of roads</span>, was born in the west-coast town of Ayr, at 22 Sandgate, on 21 September 1756, the youngest child and second son of James McAdam of Waterhead (<i>c</i>.1718&#150;1770), and his wife, Susannah Cochrane (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1717). His father was a minor laird and his mother a niece of the seventh earl of Dundonald, while his middle name records his paternal great-grandmother's links with the Loudoun family; but despite these advantages McAdam's early life was unsettled. Ancestral lands at Waterhead were sold off, the family's home in the parish of Carsphairn was destroyed by fire, and they were obliged to move to a rented house, Blairquhan near Straiton. This misfortune was compounded by an ill-advised investment in a bank in Ayr which failed two years after James McAdam's death in 1770. The family was left straitened but not impoverished, and in this difficult situation the fourteen-year-old John Loudon had to find a way to make a living. His origins and background had prepared him well for this task: he had benefited from the Scottish parish school system, having attended classes in Maybole where he is reputed to have made a model cross-section of the nearby road; as part of the Scottish diaspora he had relatives overseas to whom he could look for openings; and he had an instinctive belief in his own worth as a gentleman.<h2>
<a name="Earlybusinessventures"></a>Early business ventures</h2>In 1770 the young McAdam left home for New York, where his father's brother William had already established himself in trade and society as a prosperous merchant with a well-connected wife. McAdam was taken into the home of this childless couple and came to work closely with his uncle in ventures such as the sale of naval prizes. The antagonism of the American colonies to British rule, leading to the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, created difficulties for the McAdams as it did for other &#145;loyalists&#146;, but while his uncle retired to the country John Loudon continued in business. By 1778 he was sufficiently well established to propose marriage to Gloriana Margaretta Nicoll (<i>d</i>. 1825), the daughter of a wealthy lawyer whose family had long held positions of responsibility in the colony. When in 1783 the former colonies achieved independence, McAdam and his wife sailed from America with their two children, Ann and William, and such fortune as they had been able to secure. This proved sufficient for the purchase of a house and estate at Sauchrie, between Ayr and Maybole.<br>
<br>John Loudon McAdam's enforced return propelled his career into its second phase, as a Scottish country gentleman and business entrepreneur. He became a magistrate; a trustee of the Ayrshire turnpike roads; deputy lieutenant of the county; and the officer in charge of a volunteer artillery corps when in 1794 a French invasion seemed imminent. His business interests came to prejudice this settled life, for the Sauchrie estate had to be sold when bankruptcy threatened as a result of his association with the British Tar Company, established in Muirkirk in 1782 by his kinsman Archibald Cochrane, ninth earl of Dundonald. McAdam realized the importance of this pioneering venture, the first to produce commercially profitable coal tar, and from the mid-1780s he was successively agent, manager, and owner of the rights to the patent and the works. However, difficulties in establishing sales of coal tar for the bottoming of ships, and in maintaining supplies of coke of the right quality and quantity for the nearby Muirkirk Iron Works, led to severe legal and financial problems which were only resolved in the later 1790s by the sale of McAdam's estate and his second departure from Scotland. Despite these upheavals he retained an interest in the company and associated coalworks, and his eldest son William became manager there. For many years McAdam received an income from this source which provided some degree of financial independence, and in 1931 a cairn was built in his honour, to mark &#145;the site of his tar kilns 1786&#150;1827&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1798 the family moved south, spending a few months in Kingsdown, Bristol, where a fourth son (their seventh child) was born. He was named John Loudon junior, and like his surviving brothers William and James he was to become a road surveyor. Further sisters Gloriana and Georgina had been born in Scotland in the late 1780s. They moved on to Falmouth where McAdam found work as a prize master, a role that had proved profitable in wartime New York, but when the peace of Amiens of 1801 put an end to the taking of prize ships the family was again adrift. They returned to Bristol, but although this was to be a more permanent move the city's directories suggest a reluctance to settle, for between 1802 and 1826 they rented five houses on the slopes of Brandon Hill&#151;two in Park Street, two in Berkeley Square, and one in Dowry Parade, all genteel dwellings which would have offered comfort rather than the grandeur of the houses of the merchant princes in Clifton.<h2>
<a name="Improverofroads"></a>Improver of roads</h2>The reasons for settling in Bristol have never been explained, except in terms of the opportunities provided by this second city and major port. Entries in the directories from 1807 for &#145;McAdam, James &amp; Co., Manufacturers of Lampblack, Mineral Paints, Oils etc, near the Glass-house, Limekiln Lane&#146;, suggest that Bristol may have offered McAdam a chance to resume his interest in the chemical industry through his second son, James, while maintaining the connection with the British Tar Company. McAdam established himself in Bristol civic life as successfully as he had in his native Ayrshire. The incorrect &#145;Lowdin&#146; was replaced by &#145;Loudon&#146; in the directories and &#145;Esq.&#146; was added as a sign of status. McAdam never attained membership of the select Society of Merchant Venturers, but he was made a freeman of the city by the common council in 1805. In 1811 he helped to establish the Bristol Commercial Rooms, becoming the first president, and between 1815 and 1820 he played a leading part in the campaign for a new gaol in the city. Such activities were peripheral to his main interest, however&#151;the improvement of the roads that were so vital for the growing economy&#151;and it was to this end that he became a trustee of the large and important Bristol Turnpike Trust.<br>
<br>By the early nineteenth century the fact that the methods of road construction were haphazard, and the surveyors largely untrained and of low esteem, was causing official as well as private concern. Sir John Sinclair, chairman of the board of agriculture, supported a series of parliamentary committees which reported regularly from 1806. Evidence was invited, and in 1810 Sir John received an impressive memorandum from McAdam which was edited and published as an appendix to a report of the following year  (&#145;Select committee on &hellip; turnpike roads and highways&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1810&#150;11, 3). Extracts were included in McAdam's first book, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Present System of Road Making</span> (1816), which was so influential that it had reached nine editions by 1827. McAdam's views were based on a study of the conditions found on extensive travels, covering, he claimed, 30,000 miles between 1798 and 1814  (&#145;Select committee on &hellip; turnpike roads and highways&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1820, 2). These led him to conclude that the main legislative efforts of the time were misdirected, for they were concerned with the regulation of traffic (especially in respect to wheels and weights) in order to preserve the roads, rather than with methods of construction that would accommodate the traffic.<br>
<br>McAdam's recommended system of road construction involved the careful preparation of a well-drained subsoil, levelled, but with a slight fall from the centre of 1 inch to the yard. The roadstone was to be broken by seated workers with small-handled hammers into rough pieces weighing no more than 6 oz that would fit into the mouth. McAdam had observed that large stones were likely to be cracked by passing vehicles and sent flying, but that smaller, angular ones, applied to a depth of 10 inches and compressed by workmen, were consolidated by traffic to produce a resilient and impermeable surface which improved over time. These techniques were simple, effective, and economical. The substantial foundations which were such a feature of the roads built by his contemporary Thomas Telford, often at government cost, played no part of McAdam's system, and further economies came from the fact that the roads were no longer to be overburdened with stone, and that much of that already heaped upon them could be stripped off, reworked, and reused.<h2>
<a name="Organizerofroads"></a>Organizer of roads</h2>McAdam's advice extended to the organization of roads, which were to be controlled by the trustees with the assistance of an &#145;executive officer&#146;&#151;preferably a trained surveyor of good social standing in receipt of a salary which would place him beyond corruption. In December 1815 McAdam was offered the chance to put his theories into practice by his fellow Bristol Turnpike trustees, who invited him to become their general surveyor of roads at a salary of &pound;400 per year. The challenge was accepted and over the following years the Bristol Trust was managed with great skill and economy. By 1819 it controlled 178 miles, and McAdam's salary had risen to &pound;500 per annum, out of which he supported his office and family, and kept a carriage, horses, and servants. His work on the road from Bristol towards Shepton Mallet was noted by Sir John Coxe Hippisley, whose recommendation to the postmaster-general provided McAdam with further opportunities for public activity, since good roads were vital to the speedy delivery of mail.<br>
<br>As his reputation grew McAdam was able to extend his influence further by becoming, with the support of his family, a surveyor or consultant to other trusts. By 1819 he, James, and William worked for twenty-five trusts, and over the whole period to the death of his grandson in 1861 the family were surveyors to almost 150 trusts  (Reader, appendix 1). The support of the Post Office and the board of agriculture remained firm, and parliamentary committees continued to provide a platform for McAdam's views. His claim for financial compensation for the country-wide work undertaken on behalf of the road system, mostly at his own cost, was recognized, and between 1820 and 1825 McAdam received &pound;6000 from public funds  (&#145;Select committee on the petition&#146;). However, his fame on the national stage produced little joy in Bristol, where the turnpike trustees felt themselves neglected, despite the appointment in April 1824 of McAdam's son John Loudon jun. as joint general surveyor. McAdam's absences provoked a vote of censure and he chose to resign; nevertheless, he agreed to return on his own terms when invited to do so, perhaps because the surveyorship of the adjoining Bath Trust was then in view, offering the chance of managing the two important trusts side by side. McAdam was appointed to the Bath roads in 1826 and maintained his connection with both until his death in 1836. He conducted the business of the Bristol Trust with his son John Loudon, and that of the Bath Trust with his grandson William.<br>
<br>At the same time as his difficulties with the Bristol trustees, McAdam's links with the city were further weakened by the death of his wife in 1825. Two years later he moved to Hoddesdon in the Hertfordshire countryside and married her younger relative, Anne Charlotte Delancey (1786&#150;1862), who was born in Bath but who had American connections. They lived amiably, with summer visits to Scotland where McAdam delighted in places connected with his boyhood. His surveyorships increased at this time, perhaps in association with these journeys, for they came to include seven in northern England and six in Scotland. Most were held until his death, and it was while returning from a visit to Scotland in 1836 that the eighty-year-old McAdam died on 26 November in Moffat, the former home of his grandmother in whose grave he was buried on 2 December. The tombstone still stands, but an attempt by his son James to raise a public monument failed and the fund was closed in 1849. It had been supported by many eminent people, but the public who had so recently shown great enthusiasm for the &#145;macadamizing&#146; of the roads had failed to respond, perhaps reflecting the downturn in the fortunes of the roads in the face of railway competition.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>The first systematic builder and administrator of roads in Britain since Roman times, McAdam was one of that select band whose achievements have led to their names becoming part of the common language. From the 1820s the term &#145;macadam&#146; or &#145;macadamized&#146; came to mean a good road surface, achieved by the judicious use of stone over which horse-drawn vehicles could travel quickly and smoothly within a well-planned and organized network which approached something of a national system. The survival of the term was ensured by the arrival of the motor car with its accompanying clouds of dust, for the control of this nuisance by the application of tar to road surfaces gave rise to its evolution into &#145;tarmacadam&#146; and &#145;tarmac&#146;.<br>
<br>McAdam deserves to be remembered for his ability to create and seize opportunities, and to overcome failure. His greatest achievement lay in devising a simple and economical system of construction which brought speed, efficiency, and comfort to the roads. With his strong sense of his own worth he conferred distinction upon the work of the road surveyor, elevating into a profession what had previously been considered a humble task. He was not an engineer on a grand scale like his rival Thomas Telford or the early railway builders, but by his tireless advocacy of the cause of good roads he effected great changes in the transport system of the country. His emphasis on good management inspired the wish to consolidate the trusts into fewer but larger ones, with higher and less variable standards. This aspiration was never given legislative reality, but because McAdam's three sons and four grandsons followed him into the profession he came close to achieving this aim through his family connections. The warmth of feeling within this circle is shown by surviving letters and accounts, which recall McAdam's &#145;eyes of remarkable brightness&#146;  (Devereux, 146). McAdam may have refused the knighthood later accepted by his son James  (Webb and Webb, 184), but he could not deny the immortality gained by having his name pass into the language.<br>
<br>McAdam's second surviving son, <a name="cosubject_59956"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Nicoll McAdam</span>  (1786&#150;1852), <span class="occ">builder and administrator of roads</span>, was born at Sauchrie House, Ayrshire, on 9 April 1786. He married Harriet Younger, and they had at least two children. He followed a career as a government contractor, supplying the Ordnance, the Royal Military College, and other departments, for several years, until in 1817 he undertook the surveyorship of the Epsom Trust at the request of his busy father. He went on to become the surveyor to thirty-nine turnpike trusts, including the Metropolitan Trust established in 1826  (7 Geo. IV c. 142), which amalgamated fourteen London trusts north of the Thames. The new trust controlled the chief roads radiating to the north and west of the city. Although not always above criticism, he showed the same skills of professional competence in road construction and financial management as his father had done, allied to an attention to detail that enabled him personally to assemble the facts on the turnpike trusts in England and Wales presented annually to parliament from 1836. He became a distinguished professional figure in his own right and although family piety held his knighthood, granted in 1834, to be in lieu of one declined by his father, it may also have been granted on individual but overshadowed merit. The timing of the cartoon &#145;Colossus of Roads&#146; (1827), the fact that the figure is athwart the main north and west roads into the metropolis, and that he bears a closer resemblance to the son than the father, suggest that popular sentiment may here have been referring to another talented member of the McAdam family and not their progenitor.<br>
<br>Sir James McAdam's activities were curbed by the growth of the railways from the 1830s onwards. Local trusts which employed him as surveyor had difficulty raising enough income to pay his salary, and the Metropolis Trust came under increased pressure from critics who depicted it as unaccountable to the public from which it enjoyed sums presented as exorbitant. Before the latter body was dissolved McAdam died at his London home, 17 Finchley Road, St John's Wood, on 30 June 1852; his death notice in <span class="italic">The Times</span> also referred to his country residence of Tindon End, Great Sampford, Essex.<br>
