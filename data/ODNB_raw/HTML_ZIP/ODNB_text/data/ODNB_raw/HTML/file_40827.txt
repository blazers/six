<span class="headword">Higham, Sir  Charles Frederick</span>  (1876&#150;1938), <span class="occ">advertising agent and publicist</span>, was born at South Grove, Walthamstow, Essex, on 17 January 1876, the eldest of three sons of Charles Higham (1851&#150;1885), a clerk in the Custom House, who became a solicitor's clerk, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trigg (<i>b</i>. 1851/2). He attended school in St Albans. Following his father's death his family emigrated to America. He left home at thirteen and endured a pell-mell existence in the United States where, as he was wont to boast, he held as many jobs as Heinz had varieties. After returning to England he held down three more, one with W. H. Smith, newsagents. He then went on to sell space on theatre curtains and other novelties and soon found that he had effectively become manager of an agency. This became Charles F. Higham Ltd and by 1914 could claim such choice clients as Waring and Gillow, Austin Reed, and Marshall and Snelgrove, all high-class retail outlets. On 15 December 1911, described as a widower (though no detail of the earlier marriage is known), he married Jessie Stuart Macintosh Simpson Munro (1882/3&#150;1925), daughter of John Munro, farmer.<br>
<br>Higham was a rumbustious, fiercely energetic, and indefatigable self-publicist, but though he understood the power of advertising, he failed to accept the growing trend for sophisticated market research. The aggregate of his thinking was expressed in numerous publications, including <span class="italic">Scientific Distribution</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Advertising: its Use and Abuse</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Higham's Magazine</span>, a business and sales monthly, first issued from Imperial House, Kingsway, in March 1914.<br>
<br>During the First World War Higham's expertise was channelled to government use. With Thomas Russell and others, he sat on the voluntary committee on recruiting, dedicated to fostering patriotism. Posters were transformed from purely commercial art to a potent means of propaganda of unlimited stimulative possibilities, Alfred Leete's &#145;Your Country Needs You&#146; being the best known. Higham started the 1st battalion of volunteers at the outbreak of war. &#145;The Optimists Corps&#146; had little concern with advertising, but provided businessmen who, for one reason or another&#151;age, health, or priority business&#151;could not enlist, with the chance of learning the rudiments of soldiering. He also restored the faltering momentum of the second war loan (1915) and as director of the National War Savings Committee helped organize the victory loan campaign of 1917.<br>
<br>Higham's organizational capacity was boundless, embracing the War Shrine Movement for &#145;Remembrance Day&#146;, 4 August 1917, the Red Cross, the Star and Garter Fund, recruiting for the Royal Irish Constabulary, and the national tribute to Lord Roberts. Having spent millions of the taxpayers' money, leading advertising men felt they had done their bit. The award of a knighthood in 1921, a vote of thanks in the House of Commons, and presentation in 1930 of the Publicity Club cup for sustained creative output seemed no more than Higham's due. A parliamentary career seemed inevitable. From 1918 to 1922 Higham sat as MP for South Islington, representing the coalition Unionists, having been chairman of the coalition publicity committee in the 1918 general election. The novelist Ethel Mannin, who worked for Higham from 1915 until 1919 as typist, copywriter, and associate editor of his theatrical journal <span class="italic">The Pelican</span>, recalled his unique force of personality, singleness of purpose, and energy  (<span class="italic">Confessions and Impressions</span>, 1930, 131&#150;6).<br>
<br>Certainly the finest public orator in his field and a unique force in dynamic publicity, Higham led a campaign in America in 1924 to popularize tea-drinking. It took that country by storm, and within weeks tea-shops were opening across the continent. He was an ardent believer in federations of advertising clubs, and he was president in 1920 of the Thirty Club (motto: &#145;For the Betterment of Advertising&#146;) when the first plans were made for the great advertising exhibition at the White City in 1921. In 1922, following up an earlier initiative in transatlantic lobbying aborted by war, he led a delegation on a barnstorming mission to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World convention in Milwaukee, urging American media personnel to hold their 1924 meeting in London. This duly took place and from it was born in 1926 what came to be known as the Advertising Association.<br>
<br>Shortly after the death of his wife, Jessie, Higham married, on 20 August 1925, Eloise Rowe Ellis (<i>b</i>. 1895/6), the divorced wife of Robert Lee Ellis and daughter of John Charles Rowe, tobacco merchant, of Buffalo, USA. This marriage was dissolved in 1930, and on 17 July 1930 he married Josephine Janet Keuchenius (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), divorced wife of Adrian Keuchenius and daughter of Harold Arthur Webb, coal merchant. They had one son. This marriage was dissolved in April 1934, and he married on 30 July 1936 Ruth Agnes Marian Neligan (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), a widow, daughter of Reginald Newton Dawes Smith, captain in the Royal Artillery. They had a daughter. Higham died of pneumonia and cancer of the mouth on 24 December 1938 at his home, The Mount, South Godstone, Surrey.<br>
