<span class="headword">Hart,  Horace Henry</span>  (1840&#150;1916), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 23 March 1840 in Ballingdon, Sudbury, Suffolk, the son of William Hart (<i>b</i>. 1829), a shoemaker and schoolmaster, and his wife, Caroline Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clark. At fourteen he became a reading boy at the publishers Woodfall and Kinder in London. He worked as a proof-reader and cashier, and was appointed manager at the age of twenty-six. He took over the management of Savill, Edwards &amp; Co. for the Edinburgh printers Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co. in 1878, and joined Clowes &amp; Son two years later. In 1883 he became controller of the Oxford University Press; this newly created post made Hart general manager at Walton Street in Oxford, and he remained there until his retirement.<br>
<br>Hart came to Oxford as a modernizer. Benjamin Jowett had become vice-chancellor of the university in 1882, and, like the delegates of the press, Jowett was determined to abolish the unprofitable share partnership in the printing business. Hart's appointment led to the end of the partnership, as Jowett dismissed Edward Pickard Hall, the senior printer, and the delegates regained all shares in the press. With their guarded support Hart set out to reorganize Oxford's printing, and to regulate the different practices within its two sides, the learned press and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> press. Oxford's London office remained under its publisher, Henry Frowde. Jowett established a committee to investigate printing standards, and Hart reported to it. He favoured retaining the foundry&#151;the sheer variety of language and type size in Oxford's output rendered other possibilities absurd&#151;and obtaining fresh stocks from Europe. As Hart pointed out, this was precisely the course John Fell had followed when building up Oxford's printing in the seventeenth century. Hart toured Germany during 1887, and brought back thirty new founts. He introduced new casting machines and enlarged the ink factory in 1888, and a collotype department was established in 1890. Folding and stitching machinery was purchased a year later, establishing the bindery. Monotype keyboards and casters arrived in 1903, and soon became vital to Oxford's work.<br>
<br>Hart's love of printing led to the two works for which he is best remembered. In 1900 he published <span class="italic">Notes on a Century of Typography</span>. Charles Daniel had revived John Fell's types in 1876, and Hart used the neglected collection for Robert Bridges' works, notably the <span class="italic">Yattendon Hymnal</span>. Hart decided then &#145;to save the ancient printing materials belonging to the University from a state of rust and confusion&#146;  (Hart, xiii), and he cleaned, preserved, and catalogued Oxford's vast holding of matrices and punches. The <span class="italic">Notes</span> presented comprehensive specimens from this treasure trove; a beautiful limited edition, it reached a wider audience when reprinted in 1970. Hart put the rediscovered Fell to good use in his acclaimed facsimile reprints of Tudor and Stuart works, and in printing the order of service for the coronation in 1902. Hart's second major work was <span class="italic">Rules for Compositors and Readers</span>. It was issued privately in 1893, but demand was so great that Hart published the booklet in 1904. Intended as house rules for Oxford printers, it became the accepted authority on English grammar, punctuation, and disputed spellings. It was through the <span class="italic">Rules</span> that the spelling &#145;Shakespeare&#146; entered standard usage.<br>
<br>As controller Hart printed such volumes as Max M&uuml;ller's edition of the <span class="roman">Rig-Veda</span>, and early parts of James Murray's <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span>. His broader concerns made him first chief officer of the press fire brigade in 1885, and led to his founding the Clarendon Press Institute in 1893. Hart married twice. With his first wife he had two daughters, Agnes and Beatrice. With his second wife, Susan Ellen, from whom he separated in 1914, he had a son, Harold Raven Hart, and a daughter, Daisy. A series of nervous breakdowns forced Hart to retire from the press in 1915, and he committed suicide by drowning in Youlbury Lake near the home of one of his daughters in Boars Hill, near Oxford, on 9 October 1916. He was buried at St Peter's, Wootton, Berkshire. It was a tragic end to a successful career. Staff at the press had revered him, and in the course of his work there he had preserved the heritage of the press, while also thoroughly updating its procedures. Under him, Oxford won an unprecedented grand prix for books and printing at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, and weathered recession and competition from Cambridge in the 1890s. The university awarded him an MA <i>honoris causa</i> in 1897, and although the merger of learned and <span class="roman">Bible</span> sides in 1906 somewhat dented his prestige, nevertheless, at Hart's retirement, the press was modern, profitable, and much admired.<br>
