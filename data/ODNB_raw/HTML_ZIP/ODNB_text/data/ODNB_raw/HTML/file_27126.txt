<span class="headword">Templeton,  John</span>  (1802&#150;1886), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 30 July 1802, at Riccarton, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, the son of Robert Templeton. He had a fine voice as a boy and took part in concerts in Edinburgh with his eldest brother, a singer and teacher. In 1822 he became precentor to the Rose Street Secession church, then under John Brown. Intending to become a professional singer, he went to London and studied under Jonathan Blewitt, Thomas Welsh, De Pinna, and Tom Cooke.<br>
<br>In July 1828 Templeton made his stage d&eacute;but at Worthing, Sussex, as Dermot in <span class="italic">The Poor Soldier</span>, and, after some appearances in the provinces, made his London d&eacute;but on 13 October 1831 as Belville in William Shield's <span class="italic">Rosina</span> at Drury Lane. This was followed, on 20 February 1832, by his portrayal of Raimbaut in the first performance in England of Meyerbeer's <span class="italic">Robert le diable</span>. In 1833 he took the part of Don Ottavio in Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> at Covent Garden at five days' notice. That same year Maria Malibran chose him as her tenor for Bellini's <span class="italic">La sonnambula</span>, at Covent Garden, and he continued to be her leading tenor until her premature death in 1836. After their final performance together on 16 July 1836 Malibran gave him the jewelled betrothal ring which she always wore as Amina. Bellini was so pleased with Templeton's performance of the part of Elvino that he once embraced him and promised to write a part that would immortalize him. Templeton played the leading tenor roles in the first performances in English of Rossini's <span class="italic">Le si&egrave;ge de Corinthe</span> (1836), Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span> (1838), and Donizetti's <span class="italic">La favorite</span> (1843). He visited Paris in 1842 with Balfe, and met Auber. The following year he started touring the provinces giving lecture recitals on Scottish, English, and Irish folk-songs, and in 1845&#150;6 he went on a tour of America with his &#145;Templeton Entertainment&#146;. He retired to New Hampton, near London, in 1852, and died there at his home, Temp&eacute; Villa, on 2 July 1886. He had four brothers, all of whom were singers.<br>
<br>Templeton's voice was of very fine quality and exceptional compass. Cooke called him &#145;the tenor with the additional keys&#146;. His chest voice ranged over two octaves, and he could sustain A and B[flat] in alt with ease. His weakness was an occasional tendency to sing flat. He had a repertory of thirty-five operas, in many of which he created the chief parts. He also wrote a few songs, one, &#145;Put off! Put off!&#146; on the subject of Queen Mary's escape from Lochleven. <span class="italic">A Musical Entertainment</span>, his reminiscences and commentaries, was published in Boston in 1845.<br>
