<span class="headword">Bage,  Robert</span>  (1728?&#150;1801), <span class="occ">businessman and novelist</span>, was born at Darley, near Derby, on 29 February 1728, according to his lifelong friend William Hutton  (W. Hutton, 478), although Bage wrote to Hutton on 11 March 1800 declaring, &#145;This day I am 70&#146;  (Bage correspondence, Birmingham Public Library). Bage's mother was the first among four wives of George (?) Bage, a paper maker, of Darley. She died soon after his birth and his father moved to Derby, where Bage was educated at a common school. Hutton recalled that by age seven Bage made &#145;such progress in letters, that he was the wonder of the neighbourhood&#146;, having mastered both Latin and the manual exercise, or drill in handling a musket  (W. Hutton, 478). The later supposition that Bage was raised as a Quaker has been discredited  (Sutherland, 32&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Businessandfamily"></a>Business and family</h2>Bage's father trained him in paper making and at twenty-three, on 3 August 1751 at All Saints Church, Mackworth in Derby, Bage married Elizabeth Woolley. She was later described as &#145;a young woman who possessed beauty, good sense, good temper, and money&#146;, the last of which enabled him to enter business as a paper and cardboard manufacturer, at Elford, near Tamworth  (C. Hutton, &#145;Memoir&#146;, xvii). There were three sons of the marriage: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76758/', "Charles Woolley Bage (1751&#150;1822)")</script>, the eldest, a wine merchant and land surveyor at Shrewsbury, went into linen manufacture and factory construction, and died in 1822 aged seventy; a second son died in young manhood; Edward was an apothecary at Tamworth. Bage continued his self-education, setting aside three hours each afternoon for reading. In his thirties he taught himself French and Italian and travelled to Birmingham once a week to learn mathematics, which he picked up so quickly that within a month he was teaching his teacher. He later told William Godwin that he had relished poetry as a youth, but his study of mathematics, pursued for twelve years, supervened. Bage rarely travelled more than 50 miles from home, and never spent more than a week in London (<span class="italic">Godwin and Mary</span>, 101, 102; Paul, 1.262&#150;3). According to Hutton, &#145;His person was of a smallish size, about five feet three inches, and of a spare habit, not robust, but his constitution good&#146;  (W. Hutton, 478&#150;80).<br>
<br>In 1756 Bage proposed to the businessman William Hutton that he sell paper for him by wholesale purchase or on consignment. With this &#145;small hint&#146; Hutton opened the &#145;Paper Warehouse&#146; at Birmingham and subsequently &#145;acquired an ample fortune&#146;  (C. Hutton, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 97). The arrangement brought Bage about &pound;500 a year for the rest of his life. Others asked Bage to supply them but he declined. Hutton indicated what kinds and quantities of paper and board he anticipated selling, and Bage manufactured accordingly. Bage's brother also supplied Hutton; perhaps this was Joseph Bage, a paper maker at Bridge, Chester, in the 1780s. Paper and board making were crafts, supply of raw materials was uncertain and irregular, and product quality could be uneven, causing occasional friendly disputes between Hutton and Bage. Bage obtained rags for paper from London and Germany. Later he had some interest in another paper factory at Shugborough, which also supplied Hutton.<br>
<br>Bage paid bills when tendered, and expected others to do likewise. In his witty, teasing notes to Hutton, written on invoices, he complained about Hutton's frequent requests for discounts, the inconsistency of excise tax on paper, the cost of rags, wet weather slowing paper's drying, his workmen's demands for higher wages, and the state of the country. He wrote to Hutton, &#145;God bless the king and thee But I wish you would both suck less vigorously&#146;  (Bage correspondence, Birmingham Public Library); none the less he usually complied with Hutton's requests and his workmen's and the excise officer's demands.<br>
<br>Bage had other business interests. In 1765 he engaged in a large ironworks with three partners, one of whom was Erasmus Darwin, a leading figure of the midlands Enlightenment and later described by his wife as Bage's &#145;very particular friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godwin and Mary</span>, 99). When the partnership was dissolved after fourteen years, Bage lost around &pound;1500. According to Hutton, &#145;Fearing the distress of mind would overcome him, he took up the pen to turn the stream of sorrow into that of amusement; a scheme worthy a philosopher&#146;  (W. Hutton, 479). He later told William Godwin that he turned to novels &#145;for want of books to assist him in any other literary undertaking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godwin and Mary</span>, 101). He published four novels, anonymously, from 1782 to 1788: <span class="italic">Mount Henneth</span> (2 vols., 1782; see Steeves, 27), <span class="italic">Barham Downs</span> (2 vols., 1784), <span class="italic">The Fair Syrian</span> (1787), and <span class="italic">James Wallace</span> (3 vols., 1788); two more novels followed in the 1790s. Perhaps thanks to his German business contacts, all but <span class="italic">James Wallace</span> were translated into German, and <span class="italic">Barham Downs</span> and <span class="italic">The Fair Syrian</span> were translated into French  (Moran, 173&#150;8).<h2>
<a name="Thenovels"></a>The novels</h2>Bage is known to have subscribed to two works, <span class="italic">The Life of Miss Fanny Brown, a Clergyman's Daughter</span> (1760), a novel by John Alcock, music director at Lichfield Cathedral from 1749 to 1760 and organist at Tamworth parish church, and <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth</span> (1778) by John Whitehurst, a friend since youth and associate of the Derby Philosophical Society, to which Bage belonged. The society was founded in 1784 by Erasmus Darwin; it had links to the Lunar Society of Birmingham and the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, to the continental and Scottish Enlightenments, and to the English dissenting academies. It met regularly and united scientific research with commercial application. Some members' scientific interests appear in Bage's novels; more important, Bage fictionalizes ideas and values promoted by the society's members and others like them throughout Britain and Europe.<br>
<br>In order to do so, Bage uses plots of romantic comedy, set in contemporary middle-class and gentry society, in which a younger generation imbued with idealism, toleration, egalitarianism, entrepreneurship, and reform replaces an older generation still relying on hierarchy, legalism, and inherited authority. Characters are designed to individualize these diverse values and practices; they are also designed for social comprehensiveness, to represent various kinds of social and cultural difference found throughout Britain and its empire, from Indians to Scots, from peasants to aristocrats, emphasizing issues of class, gender, and ethnicity. In order to give voice to such characters and issues, Bage preferred the epistolary form in his earlier novels; in his later ones he includes many letters, and in all his works he includes numerous dialogues, debates, and inset biographies and autobiographies. There is much satire on the established order, for Bage addresses divisive issues from the American War of Independence through the Irish crisis of the 1780s to the French Revolution debate in the 1790s. The novels' import is that the values promoted in their pages can address and resolve these issues, working at the domestic and local level, through civil society rather than the state and its institutions, from the church through the legal system to armed force.<br>
<br>Bage maintained these politics through the local, national, and international conflicts of his time. On 1 August 1787, after another abrasive encounter with state officers, he wrote ruefully to Hutton,<blockquote>Oh how I wish thou wouldst bend all thy powers to write a history of Excise &hellip; with cases &hellip; Shewing the injustice the inequality of Clauses in acts &hellip; and the eternal direction every new one makes toward the oppression of the subject &hellip; It might be the most useful book extant. (Bage correspondence, Birmingham Public Library)</blockquote>On 18 March 1789 Bage wrote teasing Hutton about the latter's news that he was writing a critique of the English judicial system, then held up by establishment supporters as the embodiment of British liberty:<blockquote>And hast thou dared to lift thy sacrilegious pen against Juries? Against the English palladium? Tremble then. I will hold thee up to public justice, in my next work. Send me thy book though when printed; that I may set about abusing it with a decent knowledge of its contents[.] I [am] not sure that every critic takes such pains. (ibid.)</blockquote>A month later Bage wrote again,<blockquote>I received thy pamphlet; and am not certain whether I have not read it with more pleasure than any of thy former works. It is lively and the reasoning just. Only remember it is sometimes ag&lt;st&gt; the institution itself of Juries &amp; County Courts that you have directed y&lt;r&gt; satire &hellip; which I think ought to be confined to the abuses of them. (ibid.)</blockquote>A few months later, the outbreak of the French Revolution gave new hope for change in Britain to people like Bage and Hutton, though different degrees of enthusiasm for the revolution divided the Derby Philosophical Society and similar groups elsewhere. In July 1791 a mob supporting &#145;church and king&#146; attacked the homes of leading religious dissenters, including Joseph Priestley and Hutton. Hutton and his family fled, penniless, but on identifying themselves at an inn as friends of Bage they received instant credit  (W. Hutton, 479). Outraged at the mob violence, Bage wrote to his friend:<blockquote>Since the riots, in every company I have had the misfortune to go into, my ears have been insulted with the bigotry of 50 years &lt;back&gt; &hellip;, with, damn the presbyterians &hellip; &lt;with&gt; church and king &lt;huzza&gt; &hellip; and with true passive obedience &amp; nonresistance &hellip; and may my house be burnt too, if I am not become as sick of my species and as desirous of keeping out of the way, as ever was true hermit? (Bage correspondence, Birmingham Public Library)</blockquote>Bage supported Hutton's claims for compensation, and later kept him going when Hutton's business was undermined by the wartime economy, social instability, and possibly official persecution and unofficial boycott.<br>
<br>Bage himself soon contributed to the public debate on the revolution, advancing his earlier principles of toleration, egalitarianism, and reform in a new novel, <span class="italic">Man as he is</span> (4 vols., 1792). It narrates the rescue of a well-meaning young baronet from fashionable aristocratic vices by his love for a virtuous and independent woman, good friends, and his encounters in France with leaders of the earlier, moderate phase of the revolution. Perhaps prudentially, Bage did not identify himself on the title-page, even obliquely, as the author, and told Hutton, &#145;I have taken great pains, and sunk money to [William] Lane in the price, not to be known any more as a novel writer &hellip; The title of my last I even concealed from my sons&#146;. Characteristically, he added, &#145;if thou hearest any thing said of it in Birm&lt;m&gt; &hellip; if good let me know &hellip; if bad &hellip; keep it to thyself. I can digest flattery but hate correction&#146;  (Bage correspondence, Birmingham Public Library).<br>
<br>In 1792 Bage moved to Tamworth after the death of his younger son left him &#145;solitary &amp; melancholy&#146;, but walked to Elford three times a week  (<span class="italic">Godwin and Mary</span>, 100). He was increasingly irritated by government suppression and local loyalist harassment of dissidents, writing to Hutton on 24 January 1793,<blockquote>No man's ear is open to anything but Church &amp; king &hellip; and Damn the french &hellip; and damn the presbyterians. I abstain from all society, because respect for my moral principles is scarce sufficient to preserve me from insult on account of my political.</blockquote>Bage himself may have encountered harassment by this time. In 1795 the excise unjustly seized a quantity of paper; Bage went to court and won, but heard the paper was to be reseized; similar measures were used by the government at that time to persecute or even bankrupt other dissidents. Nevertheless, Bage again had recourse to comic fiction to address the times, with <span class="italic">Hermsprong; or, Man as he is not</span> (1796), which directly attacks intolerance towards new ideas and proposals for sweeping reform. Though his anti-establishment satire is even sharper here than hitherto, the novel was well received and preferred to his earlier work by several generations of readers and critics. It was his last novel.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>William Godwin sought Bage out in June 1797 and heard him described as &#145;a short man, with white hair, snuff-coloured clothes, and a walking stick&#146;. Godwin &#145;spent a most delightful day&#146; with Bage and found him to be a materialist whose favourite book was Holbach's <span class="italic">Syst&ecirc;me de la nature</span>, and who was &#145;uncommonly cheerful &amp; placid, simple in his manners, &amp; youthful in all his carriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godwin and Mary</span>, 100, 101). In March 1799 Bage thanked William Hayley for a copy of a new edition of the latter's <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Temper</span>; Bage heard through a friend that Hayley had read part of <span class="italic">The Fair Syrian</span> to his sister, drawing tears from her  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 19, fol. 38). Bage managed his paper business almost until his death on 1 September 1801. Four months later William Hutton eulogized him in the liberal <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>:<blockquote>Trade, which is thought to corrupt the mind, made no such impression upon his. Though he laid no stress upon Revelation, his dealings were stamped with rectitude; he remarked to me, &#145;Fraud is beneath a man.&#146; He had no other love for money than to use it, or he might have left a much larger property than he did. (W. Hutton, 478)</blockquote>Hutton praised Bage's &#145;rich <i>talents</i> and rare endowments&#146;, but even more the fact that &#145;he was mild in the extreme; an enemy to no man, and, I believe, never had one himself&#146;. &#145;His humanity will appear from his treatment of his servants, and even his horses, who all loved him, and whom he kept to old age.&#146; Bage's novels were as well liked as he was; reviewers welcomed them from the first and continued to do so, the Godwin circle admired them, and despite increasing political intolerance in the 1790s only the rabid <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span> (5, February 1800, 152) damned them. Barbauld's <span class="italic">British Novelists</span> included Bage (vol. 48, 1810, 1820), as did Scott's <span class="italic">Ballantyne's Novelist's Library</span> (vol. 9, 1824). Bage's novels were generally recognized as loose in construction but lively and engaging in style and narration and philosophical and moral in outlook, combining elements of Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Voltaire, Le Sage, and Marivaux. Interest in his novels dwindled after the 1820s, to revive in the later twentieth century with the renewed attention to political and ideological aspects of literature.<br>
