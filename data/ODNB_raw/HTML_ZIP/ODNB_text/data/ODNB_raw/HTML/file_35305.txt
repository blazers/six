<span class="headword">Oliver,  Frederick Scott</span>  (1864&#150;1934), <span class="occ">draper and polemicist</span>, was born on 20 February 1864 in Edinburgh, elder son of John Scott Oliver, merchant, and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17640/', "Duncan McLaren")</script>. Nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34778/', "John McLaren, Lord McLaren")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34776/', "Charles McLaren, first Baron Aberconway")</script>, he was educated in Edinburgh at George Watson's College, before going on first to Edinburgh University and then to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1889, but found that on a barrister's earnings he could not afford to marry, as he wished, Lord McLaren's daughter Katherine Augusta.<br>
<br>Oliver therefore accepted an offer from his Cambridge contemporary Ernest Debenham, and in 1892 entered the firm of Debenham and Freebody, drapers with a shop in Marylebone, and also wholesalers, manufacturers, and shippers. He trained for business by spending a year with a firm of chartered accountants, and having equipped himself on the financial side, entered the shop, and worked in each of the departments before taking on its general management. In 1893 he was able to marry his cousin, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He was a superb organizer and delegator whose orderly intelligence was never overstretched by Debenhams's highly ramified retail, wholesale, agency, and commission business. He and Ernest Debenham were successful modernizers who became joint managing directors when the firm was reconstructed as Debenhams Ltd in 1905. The store was rebuilt in 1906&#150;7, and in 1908 the company's capital was increased to &pound;1 million. The profit earned in 1910 alone exceeded &pound;100,000, and by 1914 both partners were rich men.<br>
<br>After the war Oliver and Debenham launched a policy of expansion. In 1919 Debenhams merged with Marshall and Snelgrove, Oxford Street drapers, and the firm also bought the Knightsbridge department store Harvey Nichols for &pound;217,040. Oliver retired as managing director in 1920 and as deputy chairman in 1926. He was also a member of the committee of the Hudson's Bay Company (1917&#150;25).<br>
<br>Reared in a radical household, Oliver espoused the policies of Joseph Chamberlain, and became a brilliant, provocative correspondent of imperial-minded politicians, editors, and officials. He delighted in close, compact argument, and after the publication in 1904 (under the pseudonym of John Draper) of <span class="italic">The Statesman and the Bishop</span>, he was regarded as the ablest pamphleteer in Britain. His first book, <span class="italic">Alexander Hamilton</span> (1906), had an influence comparable to Burke's <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Present Discontents</span> or Disraeli's <span class="italic">Lord George Bentinck</span>. It described the advent of organic unity into the newly fledged United States, and presented a model for British imperial federation. Oliver was a founder of the Compatriots' Club in 1904, and after 1909 was an active member of the Round Table movement. During the constitutional crisis in 1910 he wrote eight letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, printed under the alias Pacificus, successfully calling for an inter-party conference to break the deadlock and, less successfully, for a federalist convention. He published three cognate books between 1913 and 1917.<br>
<br>An ally of Lord Milner, Oliver disdained what he considered to be the drowsy comforts and factious corruption of parliamentary democracy; he refused to seek a candidature. Though as a great-nephew of John Bright he had been forbidden as a child to play with toy soldiers, he became a fierce supporter of Field Marshal Roberts in his campaign for compulsory military service. He extolled Roberts as a man of plain, unerring instincts; for Oliver hated what he described as the gibbering pedantic subtleties of intellectuals or the grovelling of peacemakers. &#145;<i>Nothing</i> will save us except the sight of red blood running pretty freely; but whether British <i>and</i> German blood, or only British, I don't know&#151;nor do I think it much matters&#146;, he wrote to Milner. &#145;Blood is the necessity.&#146;  (letter of 31 March 1911, Bodl. Oxf., MS Milner 13). He thought British public life mired in cowardice and indolence, and greeted the declaration of war in 1914 with relief. The excuse for these ebullitions must be that Oliver contracted tuberculosis around 1906; ill health made him excitable and induced an extravagant admiration of manly fortitude. &#145;He was very, very clever and very, very superior, and very spoilt&#151;and he was a dilettante in finance&#146;  (Crow, 76&#150;7) according to George Macaulay Booth who tried to recruit him in 1914 to an official committee on wartime supplies. Oliver declined Booth's approach, and instead wrote <span class="italic">The Ordeal of Battle</span> (1915), a critical examination of the origin and conduct of the war comparable to Swift's <span class="italic">Conduct of the Allies</span>. He treated war as an eternal human necessity, and contended that under modern conditions the whole nation rather than the armed forces must be conscripted.<br>
<br>Oliver described his choices in 1913 as &#145;to be a third-rate sermonising litterateur; an officious, mischievous and ignorant puller of wires; or a moderately efficient journalist&#146;  (letter to Lord Milner, 1 March 1913, Bodl. Oxf., MS Milner 13). He resembled a seer&#151;imaginative, intuitive, transfiguring facts into visions&#151;and was by turns satirical, farcical, vehement, seductive, and debonair. G. M. Trevelyan wrote of his &#145;matchless conversation&#146; that &#145;its intellectual power was tempered with a quaint, sweet humour, testifying to the breadth and kindliness that underlay his revolt against sentiment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 June 1934). He also had a roving eye for pretty women.<br>
<br>From 1905 until 1928 Oliver owned Checkendon Court in the Chiltern hills, but latterly settled on estates which he had bought in 1916 in the Cheviots. His reflections on statecraft in <span class="italic">The Endless Adventure</span>, a three-volume study of the parliamentary system in the age of Walpole (1930&#150;35), influenced Conservative leaders of the period, particularly Stanley Baldwin. A selection of his wartime letters was posthumously published as <span class="italic">The Anvil of War</span> (1936). Oliver died on 3 June 1934 at Edgerston, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, and was buried at Edgerston churchyard on 6 June. He was survived by his wife.<br>
