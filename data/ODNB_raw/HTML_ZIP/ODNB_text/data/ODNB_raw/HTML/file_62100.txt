<span class="headword">Quill,  Jeffrey Kindersley</span>  (1913&#150;1996), <span class="occ">aviator and military aircraft marketing executive</span>, was born on 1 February 1913 at Belle Croft, 72 South Terrace, Littlehampton, Sussex, the third son and fifth of the five children of Arthur Maxwell Quill (1864/5&#150;1925), civil engineer, and his wife, Emily Molesworth (1870&#150;1938), daughter of Captain Edward Molesworth Kindersley JP. His father was Irish and his mother English.<br>
<br>Inspired by flying from the age of five after seeing aeroplanes land near his birthplace, Quill was educated at Lancing College before entering the Royal Air Force in 1931 as a pilot officer on a short service commission. He went solo after only five hours twenty minutes' dual instruction at 3 flying training school, Grantham, and passed out the following year as a flying officer with the rating of &#145;exceptional&#146;. He then served with the crack 17 (fighter) squadron at Upavon.<br>
<br>In November 1934, aged only twenty-one, Quill was posted to command the RAF meteorological flight at Duxford, near Cambridge. He was rated &#145;exceptional&#146; again; and in the ensuing thirteen months made two flights a day in all weathers (in open-cockpit, unheated Siskin IIIAs) with 100 per cent reliability. For this achievement he was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1936.<br>
<br>Hearing that Joseph (Mutt) Summers, chief test pilot at Vickers (Aviation), needed help with the demanding flight test programme at Weybridge and at Vickers Supermarine, Eastleigh&#151;in particular with Reginald Mitchell's new type 300 fighter, later named &#145;Spitfire&#146;&#151;Quill applied for release from the RAF, and on 6 January 1936 became Summers's principal assistant.<br>
<br>After Summers had made the maiden flight of this prototype fighter K5054 at Eastleigh on 6 March 1936 Quill first flew it himself on 26 March 1936. Sadly this was the only example of the 22,749 Spitfires and Seafires subsequently built that Mitchell saw: he died only three months after Summers and Quill had pronounced it an unqualified success. On 9 October 1937 Quill married Patricia Ann (<i>b</i>. 1915), daughter of Colonel John Stuart Campbell; the marriage was dissolved in 1945.<br>
<br>After transferring full time to Vickers Supermarine in 1938 Quill took complete charge of Spitfire test flying; but with the outbreak of war and the fall of France he felt it his duty to return to a fighter squadron. Forestalling opposition from his employers, he successfully argued the need to gain frontline operational experience, and returned to the Royal Air Force during the battle of Britain in 1940, serving with 65 (Spitfire) squadron. He shot down two enemy aircraft before returning to his own hazardous job. In the same year he became chief test pilot for Vickers-Armstrongs (Supermarine Works). In January 1943 he was awarded the OBE, and he served for five months of that year with the Fleet Air Arm as a lieutenant-commander, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, helping to develop better carrier-deck-landing with the Seafire, the naval version of the Spitfire.<br>
<br>Quill made the first flights and masterminded the development and production test flying of all fifty-two variants of the Spitfire&#151;the only allied fighter to remain in full production and frontline service throughout the Second World War. He also made the first flights of the Dumbo, an experimental variable-incidence wing torpedo bomber; the Spiteful; the Seafang; and ultimately, in July 1946, the Attacker, the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Quill's second marriage&#151;to (Eirene) Pamela Acland Allen (1921&#150;1969), daughter of Captain Cecil Charles Acland Allen RN, on 24 February 1945&#151;produced two daughters, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1946) and Virginia (<i>b</i>. 1948). The marriage was dissolved on 21 March 1967.<br>
<br>In 1947, after sixteen years of arduous flying had taken their toll on his health, Quill had to retire from active flight testing, having logged more than 5000 flying hours in ninety aircraft types. Undaunted, he stepped immediately into another demanding career, initially as sales manager of Vickers-Armstrongs (Supermarine Works) in 1948 during the pioneering transition into the jet age; he returned to Weybridge in 1957 as head of the military aircraft office of Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft). As military aircraft sales manager of British Aircraft Corporation (formed in 1960) he became deeply involved in development of the TSR2 supersonic bomber until its cancellation by the Labour government in 1965. Meanwhile he kept his aerobatics well honed, flying the aptly registered Spitfire QJ-J at air displays, and he made his last Spitfire flight in June 1966, thirty years after his first flight in the prototype in 1936.<br>
<br>In 1966 Quill was appointed sales director of the Anglo-French company set up to develop the Jaguar supersonic combat aircraft. Later he became marketing director of Panavia, the Anglo-German-Italian consortium developing the Tornado swing-wing fighter. His third marriage, on 3 October 1969, was to (Theodora) Claire (1918&#150;2000), daughter of Alfred Reginald Legge. She was a retired WRAF wing commander. Quill retired in 1978 after forty-seven years in the aviation industry, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1980. He also served as president of the Spitfire Society, and was a distinguished member of the Royal Air Force Club in London for sixty-four years.<br>
<br>A keen sportsman, Quill had interests that included sailing (he was shortlisted for the British Olympic-class sailing team) and in 1962 he won the Daily Express offshore powerboat race in &#145;Tramontana&#146;, designed by Peter Du Cane. Passionately interested in English literature, he spent his initial retirement in north Wales reading and writing, and published two highly regarded books: <span class="italic">Spitfire: a Test Pilot's Story</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">Birth of a Legend: the Spitfire</span> (1986). Later he and his wife, Claire, moved to the Isle of Man. He died at his home there, Reayrt House, Andreas, near Ramsey, on 20 February 1996, and was buried on 27 February at Andreas church.<br>
<br>One of the finest British test pilots of his era, whose name will remain forever linked with the Spitfire, Jeffrey Quill showed outstanding professionalism and a courteous manner in everything he did. Sir George Edwards OM said of him: &#145;Jeffrey Quill was one of the most articulate test pilots I ever encountered; and to him goes much of the credit for turning Mitchell's brilliant concept into a great fighting machine&#146;.<br>
