<span class="headword">Porter,  (Ann) Agnes</span>  (<em>c.</em>1752&#150;1814), <span class="occ">governess and diarist</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the eldest of the four children of the Revd Dr Francis Porter (<i>bap</i>. 1718, <i>d</i>. 1782), Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1724&#150;1794). Her birthday fell on 18 June but the exact year of her birth is unknown. Her father was born in Great Yarmouth, where he was apprenticed to a woollen-draper in 1730. He was subsequently ordained and settled in Edinburgh, where he probably married. Nothing is known of Agnes Porter's early life and education but by 1763 the family had moved to Chelsea, where they lived for several years. Her father was presented to the vicarage of Wroughton, Wiltshire, in 1778 and remained there until his death in 1782. Lacking independent means the Porters were unable to support Agnes and her two younger sisters, Elizabeth and Fanny; a brother, whose name is unknown, died young.<br>
<br>By 1777 Agnes Porter was living in Great Yarmouth as companion to the wife and daughters of a lawyer, John Ramey. In 1782 she moved to Swindon to be governess to the daughters of Ambrose Goddard of Swindon House, MP for Wiltshire from 1772 to 1806. From 1784 to 1797 she was governess to the children of the second earl and countess of Ilchester, living mainly at Redlynch House, near Bruton, Somerset, until 1792 and then at Melbury House, Melbury Sampford, Dorset. In 1797 she returned to Great Yarmouth to live as companion to Elizabeth Upcher, one of the Ramey daughters. Elizabeth Upcher died in 1799 and Agnes moved to south Wales to be governess to the children of her former pupil Lady Mary Fox Strangways, who had married Thomas Mansel Talbot of Penrice Castle, on the Gower peninsula, in 1794.<br>
<br>Described by Sydney Smith as &#145;Infinitely vulgar&#146; and &#145;a very ordinary article&#146; (NL Wales, MS 11981E; <span class="italic">Letters of Sydney Smith</span>, 47&#150;8) Agnes Porter thought herself &#145;plain, but chatty and tolerably agreeable in conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Governess</span>, 166). Lacking both beauty and fortune, she never married, though she would have liked to have done so. Probably educated largely at home, she was highly intelligent and had a lively and enquiring mind, retaining her enthusiasm for learning throughout her adult life. Having spent some time in France, at Boulogne, during her youth, she could read and write French well. Her main interests were literature, history, religion, education, and languages; she tried to teach herself Italian, Latin, and German. Unlike some governesses she was an excellent teacher, who genuinely enjoyed the company of her pupils. Those pupils included Elizabeth Fox Strangways, mother of the photographic pioneer William Henry Fox Talbot, and, for several years at Penrice, Henry Fox Talbot himself and his first cousin Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, later MP for Glamorgan. She is of particular interest because she worked in a period before governesses became an essential status symbol in every genteel household. Her wide circle of friends, with several of whom she corresponded for many years, included, in addition to her former pupils, Elizabeth Liege, wife of the artist and author Joseph Moser; the London print merchant and mezzotint engraver Valentine Green; and Dr Malcolm Macqueen, father of the politician and colonizer of New South Wales, Thomas Potter Macqueen.<br>
<br>Agnes Porter wrote one book for children, entitled <span class="italic">Triumphs of Reason Examplified in Seven Tales</span>, which was published by her friend Valentine Green in 1791. Her surviving journals and letters, covering the period from 1788 to 1814, include her acute observations on the activities of the occupants of the great houses in which she lived, in addition to valuable insights into the ideas and thoughts of a late-Georgian gentlewoman forced by circumstances to make her own living. In 1806 she retired from full-time work as a governess and went to live with her younger sister Fanny (<i>c</i>.1764&#150;1823), whose husband, the Revd Thomas Richards (1762&#150;1852), was curate at Fairford, Gloucestershire. From 1812 she lived in Bruton, Somerset, where she died, aged &#145;about 60&#146; (but probably a little older), and was buried in the churchyard there on 21 February 1814.<br>
