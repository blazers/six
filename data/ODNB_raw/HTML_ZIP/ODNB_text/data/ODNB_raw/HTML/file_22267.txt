<span class="headword">Pilkington,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">composer and lutenist</span>, graduated BMus from Oxford University in 1595, stating that he had been a student of music for sixteen years. By midsummer 1602 he had been appointed a conduct (lay clerk) at Chester Cathedral; he was nominated as precentor in 1623 and retained this position until his death. Nevertheless Pilkington also had a parallel charge as parish priest. He was ordained in 1614 (curiously, in 1612 he had already been made a minor canon of the cathedral) and was given the curacy of Holy Trinity, Chester, to which he added those of St Bridget's by 1616 and St Martin's in 1622. In 1631 he also became rector of Aldford, near Chester, but resigned this living at some time between 1634 and 1636.<br>
<br>Pilkington's father and a brother had been in the service of Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby, and it was to the fourth earl's son William, the sixth earl, that Pilkington dedicated his first publication, <span class="italic">The first book of songs or ayres of 4 parts: with tablature for the lute or orpharian, with the viol da gamba</span> (1605), Pilkington also acknowledging the favour he had himself enjoyed from the earl's brother. Its twenty-one songs (to conclude, Pilkington slipped in a pavane for lute and bass viol) show some awareness of the heightened expressiveness established in English song by John Dowland, and Pilkington's choice of verse reveals much discrimination. Yet most of his songs lie closer to the tuneful ayres of Thomas Campion and Philip Rosseter which had appeared jointly in the latter's volume of 1601, and some of his shortest songs are the best: &#145;Rest, sweet nymphs&#146; has long been one of the most popular of lute ayres. Three songs are occasional pieces, all dedicated to friends, one being an elegy.<br>
<br>Pilkington's &#145;first&#146; volume of lute songs had no successor, for he now concentrated his attention on the madrigal, <span class="italic">The First Set of Madrigals and Pastorals of 3, 4, and 5 Parts, Newly Composed</span> appearing in 1613. Its style seems oddly retrospective, being founded upon the light madrigalian manner established by Thomas Morley in the 1590s, and (<i>pace</i> the title-page) raises a suspicion that some of its contents were not recent compositions. Indeed, &#145;When Oriana walked&#146; used the text also set by Pilkington's cathedral colleague Thomas Bateson in his intended contribution to <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span>, the collection of madrigals published in 1601 in honour of the ageing Queen Elizabeth. But Bateson's tribute had arrived too late for inclusion, and he had incorporated it into his own first madrigal volume (1604), adding a second madrigal, entitled &#145;Oriana's Farewell&#146;, with the final line changed to &#145;In heaven lives Oriana&#146;. Pilkington's setting of &#145;When Oriana walked&#146; had, presumably, a parallel history though, on publication, for his own final line he now substituted that from Bateson's &#145;Oriana's Farewell&#146;. For the rest, his 1613 volume is undistinguished, its twenty-two items sometimes technically unsure and faceless. Its successor, <span class="italic">The Second Set of Madrigals and Pastorals, of 3, 4, 5, and 6 Parts: Apt for Viols and Voices</span> (1624), is much superior, its finest composition, the deeply affecting &#145;Care for thy soul&#146;, blending something of the &#145;gravitie&#146; of earlier music with a more modern &#145;affective&#146; manner, and employing chromaticism impressively. The volume's twenty-six items include a duet and a &#145;dialogue&#146;, each viol-accompanied, and a six-part viol fantasia; appended is a pavane by Pilkington's earlier patron, William, earl of Derby.<br>
<br>It is surprising that, apart from two contributions to Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">The Tears or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul</span> (1614), Pilkington seems to have composed little or no church music. All three of Pilkington's published volumes describe him as a lutenist, and a small quantity of lute music by him is extant. It is probably early work, well written, but of little importance. Pilkington died in 1638.<br>
