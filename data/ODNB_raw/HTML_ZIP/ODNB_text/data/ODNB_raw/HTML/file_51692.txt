<span class="headword">Spence,  Robert</span>  (1905&#150;1976), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 7 October 1905 in South Shields, co. Durham, the only child of Robert Spence, a marine engineer, and his wife, Rebecca Robertson. He was educated at the Stanhope Road elementary school (1911&#150;17) and the Westoe secondary grammar school (1917&#150;22) at South Shields, before going in 1922 to Armstrong College (then part of the University of Durham) in Newcastle upon Tyne. He obtained a first-class BSc in chemistry in 1926, and was awarded a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research grant (1926&#150;8) to work with G. R. Clemo in research on the production and constitution of some polynuclear compounds derived from naphthalene.<br>
<br>In 1928 Spence became a Commonwealth Fund fellow at Princeton University, USA, for three years. He studied the vapour phase oxidation of ethylene (ethene) and acetylene (ethyne) in collaboration with Hugh Stott Taylor and G. B. Kistiakowsky, taking his PhD in 1930. He received an excellent physico-chemical training there, and found that the American ideals of self-help and respect for hard work influenced his personal outlook on life.<br>
<br>In 1931 Spence was appointed as a lecturer in physical chemistry at the University of Leeds. There he investigated a number of thermal and photo-oxidations and the photodecomposition of gaseous acetone (propanone), showing that the production of an acetyl radical is an essential step in the decomposition process. On 25 July 1936 he married Kate Lockwood, one of his students, with whom he shared a close and happy partnership. They had three children: Alan, Catherine, and James.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Spence, who had joined the Territorial Army in 1936, was seconded to the RAF and sent to Egypt, in July 1942, as a scientific adviser (chemical warfare). He developed a new method of dispersing dense clouds of smoke from aircraft, and showed that, contrary to contemporary opinion, mustard gas attacks in hot climates presented a serious vapour hazard. The following year, in Italy, he pioneered anti-malaria spray techniques, and after returning to Britain in November 1944 he worked on fuels for jet engines.<br>
<br>After the war Spence worked for two years in the Anglo-Canadian Atomic Energy Laboratories, at Montreal and Chalk River, on the development of a continuous process for the large-scale recovery of plutonium from irradiated uranium; before a plant could be designed, every detail of the chemistry had to be known. This complicated engineering task (laboratory methods had to be scaled up by a factor of many millions to produce the kilogram quantities needed) proved so successful that separation began on the planned date (February 1952) and proceeded quickly: the plutonium required for the first British atomic bomb was delivered six months later. In recognition of his contribution to Britain's early atomic development Spence was appointed CB in 1953.<br>
<br>While in Canada Spence was responsible for recruiting staff for the research that would later be carried out in England in the radiochemical laboratory constructed to his design at Harwell, Berkshire. In 1946 he became head of the chemistry division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. He was later chief chemist (1950&#150;60), deputy director (1960&#150;64), and director (1964&#150;8). There he was responsible for the chemical aspects of nuclear power, including the production of fuel elements and special reactor materials, waste disposal, processing of irradiated materials, and coolants. His successes lay in conceiving and organizing major industrial processes, but he maintained a personal interest in problems of an experimental nature, particularly the extraction of uranium from sea water.<br>
<br>Spence served on a number of technical committees at Harwell, together with terms on the councils of the Chemical Society, the Faraday Society, and the Royal Institute of Chemistry. He was elected FRS in 1959 and participated in the Royal Society's government grant board and its scientific research in schools committee. Most of his published work (over fifty papers, 1928&#150;72) appeared in British science journals.<br>
<br>Spence was quiet and unassuming, devoted to his family and his profession. He was unfailingly courteous, but determined and always well prepared. His friendliness, foresight, example, and enthusiasm were an inspiring influence on junior colleagues. A tall man, he enjoyed outdoor pursuits such as rowing, walking, and canoeing. In 1968 Spence left Harwell, where economic and political pressures had made his job increasingly uncongenial, and became master of Keynes College and professor of applied chemistry in the University of Kent at Canterbury. His main interest focused on the college and its students: he implanted an attitude of tolerance and mutual forbearance into a young institution composed of disparate elements. He played a vital role in the creation of an honours degree in chemistry with control engineering, and supervised experimental projects. At his retirement in 1973 Spence returned to Ranger Cottage, 5 Jennings Lane, his home in Harwell village, where he died of lung cancer on 10 March 1976. He was survived by his wife.<br>
