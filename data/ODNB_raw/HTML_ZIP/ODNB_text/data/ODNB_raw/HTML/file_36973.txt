<span class="headword">Wimperis,  Harry Egerton</span>  (1876&#150;1960), <span class="occ">government scientist</span>, was born on 27 August 1876 at 47 Brighton Road, South Hornsey, London, the only son of Joseph Price Wimperis, a mercantile clerk, later a timber merchant, and his wife, Jemima Samuel, or Wood-Samuel. After his father's early death his mother struggled to educate him. He was apprenticed at the locomotive works of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, but subsequently was able to enter the Royal College of Science (RCS) as a Tyndall prizeman, gaining a Whitworth scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he became a Salomon's scholar. He graduated with first-class honours in the mechanical sciences tripos in 1900 and, after declining a fellowship for financial reasons, spent a year at the Elswick works of Armstrong Whitworth before entering government service as engineering adviser to the crown agents for the colonies. On 28 September 1907 in Goring, Wimperis married Grace d'Avray (1881/2&#150;1960), third daughter of George Parkin, a Canadian educationist who became first organizing secretary of the Rhodes Trust, and his wife, Annie Connell. They settled in Goring and had three daughters.<br>
<br>Wimperis became an external examiner for the Royal College of Science and in 1909 published <span class="italic">The Internal Combustion Engine</span>. The same year, with Keith Elphinstone of Elliott Brothers, he patented a simple but ingenious accelerometer for rail and road transport which was unaffected by directional change or track gradient, Wimperis writing <span class="italic">Application of Power to Road Transport</span> (1913) to publicize its use. During this period he and Elphinstone also patented an aircraft rate of roll indicator and a bombsight, and Elliott Brothers later manufactured many other Wimperis instruments.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the First World War, in addition to his work with the crown agents, Wimperis assisted the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) with bombsight design. However, to secure his services exclusively the Admiralty offered him a commission as lieutenant RNVR at the Admiralty air department, where he started in August 1915. Sent to Calshot Air Station to gain air experience he soon discovered that there was no scientific basis to naval bomb aiming. On return to London he negotiated the free use of the physics department workshop at Imperial College as the Royal Naval Air Service laboratory for bombsight design and with a small team successfully developed the drift, negative lens, and course setting bombsights. He was promoted lieutenant-commander when the laboratory expanded to include engine and wireless research. When the Air Ministry was formed in 1918 Imperial College agreed to continue the laboratory arrangements providing Wimperis remained in charge, and over the next seven years the &#145;Air Ministry laboratory&#146; developed numerous navigational instruments. Wimperis lectured on navigation at Imperial College and published his <span class="italic">Primer of Air Navigation</span> in 1920. A. P. Rowe joined the laboratory in 1922 to work on compass development.<br>
<br>From 1916 all scientific research for the Air Board was under the leadership of Professor Bertram Hopkinson and his assistants, Henry Tizard, Bertram Melvill Jones, and Robert H. Mayo. This organization disappeared at the end of the war, but in 1924 Tizard on the Aeronautical Research Council convinced the Air Ministry to co-ordinate research anew. In anticipation of Tizard accepting the new post of director of scientific research Wimperis was appointed assistant director. However, when Tizard declined the post Wimperis became director the following year with David Pye as deputy director. Wimperis appointed Rowe as his personal assistant. As director, this was his great opportunity to plan, co-ordinate, and fund all ministry sponsored research, including that at aircraft manufacturers or universities. The primary aim over the next ten years was to improve the operational performance and safety of service aircraft, particularly by more use of wind tunnels. Wimperis believed in finding scientific solutions to technical problems, and he had learned to work with the military, and to administer well.<br>
<br>The 1934 summer air exercises, simulating bombing attacks on London and Coventry, showed that standing patrols of fighters along the coast were inadequate to detect an approaching enemy bomber force and that the bomber would always get through. While the RAF formed a special committee to improve the defence of London, Rowe alerted Wimperis to the fact that no scientific approach to improving air defence had been considered in some fifty Air Ministry files he had examined. Instead of another departmental committee Wimperis proposed to the secretary of state for air the formation of a small committee of specialist independent scientists consisting of Tizard, Professor A. V. Hill, Professor P. M. S. Blackett, and R. Watson-Watt to take a fresh look at the problem. Tizard was appointed chairman of the scientific survey of air defence with Rowe as secretary. By the first meeting on 28 October 1935 Watson-Watt's assistant A. F. Wilkins had confirmed Wimperis's view that &#145;death rays&#146; were not feasible, but suggested that an aeroplane might be located by radio waves, allowing Wimperis to persuade Air Marshall Dowding to spend &pound;10,000 to investigate the idea. The subsequent history of the Tizard committee and the birth of radio location, later renamed radar, is well documented, but Wimperis's foresight to initiate the committee and select its members is overlooked.<br>
<br>Wimperis turned next to the parallel problem of air offence and in 1936 set up the committee of air offence to consider how far recent advances in scientific and technical knowledge could strengthen methods of attacking enemy targets. Tizard again accepted the chairmanship with Wimperis, Pye, Rowe, and Professor Melvill Jones as members. Pye became director in 1937 when Wimperis retired, but Bomber Command were never convinced that any advice from the committee would benefit them and were poorly prepared when war started in 1939.<br>
<br>After retiring Wimperis was invited to visit Australia to advise the government on aeronautical research, which resulted in the establishment of the Aeronautical Research Laboratory in Melbourne and a chair of aeronautics at Sidney University. Melbourne University later awarded him an honorary doctorate. During the first year of the Second World War he returned in an advisory capacity to the Air Ministry at Harrogate, later undertaking other duties at Australia House. In 1941 he published a booklet <span class="italic">Defeating the Bomber</span>, and <span class="italic">Aviation</span> in 1945.<br>
<br>Wimperis was appointed OBE in 1918, CBE in 1928, and CB in 1935. Over many years he served on various committees of the Aeronautical Research Council, and was on the executive committee of the National Physical Laboratory, 1931&#150;7. Wimperis was stern and remote to junior staff, but to colleagues and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s he was a good friend with great strength of character, integrity, and a whimsical humour. In 1918 he topped the elections to the Athenaeum. He was a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, giving the 1932 Wilbur Wright lecture on &#145;New methods of research in aeronautics&#146;, and was the society's president in 1936&#150;8. In 1939 he was president of the engineering section of the British Association and a council member from 1948 to 1954. He was a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and on their council 1911&#150;14; he gave the 1944 Hawksley lecture, &#145;Research and development in aeronautics&#146;, to the Mechanical Engineers, was an honorary member of the American Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, and was an honorary fellow and crown governor of Imperial College. From 1946 to 1950 he was a member of the atomic energy study group at Chatham House, and published <span class="italic">World Power and Atomic Energy</span> in 1946. For the last few years of his life Wimperis lived at 46A Inverleith Place, Edinburgh, where he died on 16 July 1960, his wife surviving him by only a few weeks; she died on 9 August.<br>
