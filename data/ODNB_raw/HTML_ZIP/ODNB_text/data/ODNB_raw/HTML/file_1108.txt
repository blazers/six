<span class="headword">Lewis,  David</span> <span class="st"> [St David Lewis; <em>alias </em>Charles Baker]</span>  (1617&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Jesuit and martyr</span>, was born at Abergavenny in Monmouthshire in 1617. It has previously been argued that he was the son of Henry Baker and his wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Baskerville), of Herefordshire and thereby a great-nephew of Dom Augustine Baker OSB. However, there is more evidence to suggest that he was one of nine children born to the Revd Morgan Lewis (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1638), the protestant principal of the Royal Grammar School, Abergavenny, and his wife, Margaret Pritchard (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1638), a devout Catholic. He was certainly educated at the Royal Grammar School and in 1633 travelled to Paris with John Savage (later Earl Rivers). While in Paris he met Father William Talbot SJ and converted to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of war in France Lewis returned to Wales in 1636 and &#145;engaged in the study of law&#146;  (Canning, 160) but two years later he was sent by John Pritchard, his uncle and a Jesuit priest, to the English College at Rome. He arrived there on 2 November 1638 and the following day was received at the English College. At the college he stated, &#145;My name is David Lewis, <i>alias</i> Charles Baker. My father was Morgan Lewis and my mother Margaret Pritchard, both Catholics who lately died of fever&#146;  (Canning, 160). In June 1641 he received minor orders and was ordained as a priest on 20 July 1642. On St Stephen's day in this year he gave a short Latin discourse entitled &#145;Corona Christi pro spinis gemmea&#146; on the martyrdom of St Stephen before Urban VIII and on 19 April 1645 he entered the noviciate of St Andrew's in Rome. After two years probation he went to Wales to conduct missionary work, but he was recalled to Rome to act as confessor and spiritual director at the English College. In 1648 he was sent to Monmouthshire where he acted as a missionary priest for the disparate Roman Catholic population. He was twice superior of the south Wales district and rector of the Cwm Jesuit Seminary, Llanrothal, in Herefordshire, from 1667 to 1672, and again from 1674 to 1679. For thirty years he worked tirelessly visiting the persecuted Roman Catholic communities and, as a consequence of his charitable work, he was commonly known as Tad y Tlodion (Father of the Poor).<br>
<br>In November 1678 the government, alarmed by news of a popish plot, offered a reward of &pound;20 for the capture of any Roman Catholic priest. This was supplemented by a further &pound;200 by John Arnold, a local magistrate in Monmouthshire, for the conviction and execution of Catholic priests in the counties of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. Lewis's popularity among Roman Catholics and his charitable deeds meant that he was sheltered from persecution for a brief period as none was &#145;willing to turn traitor to him, or give evidence against him, or in any way to conspire for his death&#146;  (Canning, 160). Nevertheless he soon fell victim to the mass hysteria whipped up by Titus Oates. He was arrested on Sunday 17 November 1678 at St Michael's, Llantarnam parish church, in Monmouthshire, where he was preparing to say mass. He was taken under armed guard to Abergavenny and thereafter committed to Monmouth gaol. He remained there until 13 January 1679 when he was transferred to Usk gaol. While imprisoned rumours spread that he had managed to escape from his captors as well as having poisoned his gaoler.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1679 Lewis was brought before Monmouth assizes on a charge of high treason and was condemned under the act of <span class="roman">27 Elizabeth</span> as a traitor. During the trial there was evidence that one of his accusers, Dorothy James, sought revenge against him for an earlier failed chancery suit and sought to wash her hands in his blood and make &#145;porridge&#146; of his head  (Foley, 5.923). He was condemned to death the following day, but was reprieved until the following May by the judge, Sir Robert Atkins, on condition that he supply information to the privy council about the Popish Plot. At his arraignment in London Lord Shaftesbury suggested that Lewis renounce the Roman Catholic religion to save his life. Lewis, as a committed Roman Catholic, would not convert and was unable to offer any details about an alleged plot. He was sent back to Usk gaol, where he remained for a further three months before his execution at Usk on 27 August 1679. On the day of his execution he gave a speech in which he recorded that he had no knowledge of the plot and stated &#145;discover plot I could not, for I knew of none; and conform I would not for it was against my conscience&#146; (&#145;Speech of David Lewis&#146;, 2; O'Keefe, 121). Although he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, the assembled crowd took pity upon him and would not allow him to suffer. They thereby ensured that he died upon the scaffold and was not quartered. His disembowelled body was later that day buried in the churchyard of the priory church of St Mary at Usk. He was among the forty martyrs of England and Wales canonized by Paul VI on 25 October 1970.<br>
