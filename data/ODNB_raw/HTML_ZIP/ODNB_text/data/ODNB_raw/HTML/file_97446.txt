<span class="headword">Bell,  Thomas George <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1933&#150;2006), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at 33 Ramsey Road, Allerton, Liverpool, on 2 August 1933, one of seven children of James Guthrie Bell, a ship's carpenter in the merchant navy, and his wife, Gladys May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. During the Second World War he was evacuated to Morecambe, Lancashire, where he lived with three different families and attended Euston Road secondary modern school. After acting in school plays he sought a career on the stage and joined a local repertory company before training at the Bradford Civic Theatre. He subsequently acted in rep in Liverpool, Swansea, and, with the Shannon Players, in Dublin. On 22 October 1960 he married Lois Dainty, a twenty-year-old actress (as Lois Dane), and daughter of John Dainty, civil servant. They had one son, Aran.<br>
<br>Bell had made his television d&eacute;but in 1959, as a boxer in an episode of the crime drama <span class="italic">Dial 999</span>, before being cast in two productions in ITV's groundbreaking <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre</span> series of contemporary plays: as one of three sailors on shore leave in Liverpool in the writer Alun Owen's <span class="italic">No Trams to Lime Street</span> (1959) and as the young clerk Albert Stokes, whose controlling mother worries about his leading an &#145;unclean&#146; life with girls, in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">A Night Out</span> (1960). He also starred on stage in Owen's first full-length play, <span class="italic">Progress to the Park</span>, about four friends who pass from youth to manhood during a warm summer weekend in Liverpool, which was performed at the Saville Theatre in London's West End in 1961. These dramas were part of the revolution taking place in the arts, which were beginning to depict working-class culture as it really was, and Bell followed his first feature film, <span class="italic">The Criminal</span> (1960), written by Owen, with <span class="italic">The Kitchen</span> (1961), an adaptation of the Royal Court Theatre's production of Arnold Wesker's play set in the basement kitchen of a large restaurant and illustrating the dehumanizing nature of the workplace.<br>
<br>Bell made his greatest impact in <span class="italic">The L-Shaped Room</span> (1962), one of the landmark film dramas of the period, adapted by its director, Bryan Forbes, from Lynn Reid Banks's best-selling novel. Bell acted Toby, the brooding, bitter young writer in a seedy London boarding-house who falls for a pregnant, unmarried Frenchwoman, played by Leslie Caron. Great predictions were made for Bell, but he found that good starring roles in film were in short supply after his anti-establishment attitude led him to heckle the duke of Edinburgh at the 1963 British Film Academy awards dinner with the words, &#145;Make us laugh, tell us a joke!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 6 Oct 2006). He shone on the big screen as a cat-burglar in <span class="italic">He Who Rides a Tiger</span> (1965), and appeared in another dozen films over the next twenty years, but won his best roles on television.<br>
<br>Bell followed the single drama <span class="italic">The Sailor's Return</span> (1978), in which he played a nineteenth-century seaman returning from his travels, with the role of the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in the epic American series <span class="italic">Holocaust</span> (1978). Then came his most memorable small-screen performance, as Frank Ross in <span class="italic">Out</span> (1978), the writer Trevor Preston's gangland drama about a bank robber being released from jail and obsessed with tracking down the informer responsible for his conviction. After playing Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the cold, amoral head of the Soviet secret police, in <span class="italic">Reilly: Ace of Spies</span> (1983), he starred in <span class="italic">The Detective</span> (1983) as Commander Kenneth Crocker, whose principles extended to reporting his own brother-in-law for a breach of the peace. He then acted an equally disliked, but far from principled, policeman in the original <span class="italic">Prime Suspect</span> mini-series (1991). As the sexist Sergeant Bill Otley, he opposed the appointment of Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison (played by Helen Mirren) to take over a murder inquiry. After initially refusing to reprise the role, he did so for <span class="italic">Prime Suspect 3</span> (1993) and <span class="italic">Prime Suspect: the Final Act</span> (2006). He was twice nominated for a BAFTA television award as best actor, for <span class="italic">Out</span> and <span class="italic">Prime Suspect</span>.<br>
<br>On television Bell also played the coalminer Walter Morel in <span class="italic">Sons and Lovers</span> (1983) and Old Tom, Ursula's grandfather, in <span class="italic">The Rainbow</span> (1988), as well as making a rare switch to comedy to star as Harry Nash, the cantankerous wax museum owner, in <span class="italic">Hope It Rains</span> (1991&#150;2). However, Bell was best known for acting menacing, sinister characters, particularly in his later film roles, such as that of Uncle Philip, the controlling toymaker, in <span class="italic">The Magic Toyshop</span> (1987), and the petty thief Jack &#145;the Hat&#146; McVitie, whose murder brought down the East End gangster brothers, in <span class="italic">The Krays</span> (1990). Although his stage appearances were rare he won acclaim for his performance as Horst, companion of the promiscuous Max (played by Ian McKellen), in the world premi&egrave;re of Martin Sherman's <span class="italic">Bent</span> (at the Royal Court Theatre, 1979), an examination of Hitler's persecution of homosexuals, set in Dachau.<br>
<br>Bell's marriage to Lois Dainty was dissolved in 1976, and his partner for the last thirty years of his life was the television and film costume designer Frances Tempest. He became stepfather to her daughter Nellie, and they had another daughter, Polly. Having lived latterly in College Terrace, Brighton, he died of bronchopneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, and ischaemic heart disease at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, on 4 October 2006 and was survived by his partner Frances, his two children, and his stepdaughter.<br>
