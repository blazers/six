<span class="headword">Russell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cooke]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Russell <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Elizabeth Hoby, Lady Hoby]</span>  (1528&#150;1609), <span class="occ">linguist and courtier</span>, was the third of five learned daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke (1505/6&#150;1576)")</script> of Gidea Hall, Essex, tutor to Edward VI, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam. Through her father's influence she became skilled in languages. On 27 June 1558 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13414/', "Sir Thomas Hoby (1530&#150;1566)")</script> of Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, translator of Castiglione's <span class="italic">Il Cortegiano</span> into English as <span class="italic">The Courtier</span>. A son, Edward, and two daughters, who died young, were born between 1560 and 1564. She accompanied her husband to France on his appointment as ambassador in March 1566, where he died on 13 July. Shortly afterwards she gave birth to a second son, Thomas Posthumous. In Bisham church she created the Hoby Chapel, where she interred the bodies of her husband and his elder brother, Philip, in a joint monument with effigies and epitaphs in Greek, Latin, and English.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1574 Elizabeth married John, Lord Russell (<i>d</i>. 1584), heir to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24306/', "Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford")</script>. Two daughters were born, Anne and Elizabeth, and one authority records a son who died in 1580. The tradition at Bisham that her ill treatment caused a son's death (and the appearance of her repentant ghost) cannot be verified. Lord Russell predeceased his father, dying on 24 July 1584, so denying her the title of countess of Bedford. She erected a monument to him in Westminster Abbey, again revealing her linguistic skills in the accompanying inscriptions.<br>
<br>Through access to those in power, Elizabeth could offer patronage to others. She gave support to the composer John Dowland (but opposed Richard Burbage's proposal in 1596 to convert property near her Blackfriars home into a playhouse). From the 1560s to the 1590s her patronage was frequently sought in matters ranging from the shrievalty of Buckinghamshire to a knighthood for the duke of Somerset's son-in-law. She, in turn, relied on the support of her brother-in-law William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and her nephew Robert Cecil. When her despised son Thomas Posthumous fled in 1586 to avoid having to study law, she begged Burghley to take him into his service. (In 1588 Thomas was admitted to Gray's Inn as Burghley's prot&eacute;g&eacute;.) Apart from her alleged poverty, her concern in 1593 was that her daughters had been cheated of their Russell birthright by their aunt, Lady Warwick&#151;a view with which Burghley sympathized. She also sought his help in a dispute with one Lovelace, lieutenant of Windsor Forest and Castle, which had erupted into violence. In 1595 Burghley was unsympathetic, causing her to note his &#145;mutterings, which stick fast by me&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 147). Occasionally the process was reversed. On Burghley's behalf in 1596 she tackled Anthony Bacon, nephew to both, questioning his loyalty and his associates' religion.<br>
<br>In 1599, after numerous disputes, Lady Russell complained to Robert Cecil of being &#145;beggared by law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.339) and was angered by her daughter Elizabeth's &#145;presumptious disobedience&#146; in supporting a plan to be rid of Russell House&#151;a link with her second husband. She wrote repeatedly to Cecil in 1601 about Justice Warburton's revoking of a judgment against a former servant, metaphorically refusing to be &#145;bearded by a girl's tearing out of my teeth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.563&#150;4). From 1603 she disputed the earl of Nottingham's right to the lease of Donnington Castle, Berkshire, requiring Cecil's presence when the Star Chamber hearing began in 1606. Constantly interrupting the court, she lost the case.<br>
<br>For much of her life Elizabeth enjoyed royal patronage. The queen was reputedly godmother to two of her children, and after Lord Russell's death she paid debts and provided for both daughters, eventually granting them posts at court. In 1592 the queen, court, and privy council were entertained at Bisham Abbey, but in 1595 Lady Russell found she could only see the queen when &#145;going to God's house&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 147&#150;8). She was back in favour in June 1600, when the queen attended the marriage of her daughter Anne to Henry, Lord Herbert, son of the earl of Worcester, at Blackfriars. Her younger daughter died a few days later, allegedly from a needleprick in her left forefinger. She wrote to Robert Cecil in 1601 that the girl had not been given as honourable a burial as &#145;meaner maids&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.562) in the queen's service, while her own uncomfortable farewell from court had &#145;killed a courtier&#146; in her.<br>
<br>Lady Russell retained her linguistic skills over the years, adding Latin verses and quotations to letters, and translating from the French <span class="italic">A way of reconciliation touching the true nature and substance of the body and blood of Christ in the sacrament</span> (printed in 1605). She dedicated this to her surviving daughter. In her will she claimed to eschew &#145;vain ostentation or pomp&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/113, fol. 435<i>r</i>) for her funeral, but wrote to Sir William Dethick, Garter king of arms, about the number of mourners and appropriate display for her status. She also left money for seventy poor widows to be provided with funeral clothes. Her will reveals that apart from her Berkshire and London holdings (inherited by her son Edward) she had tithes from eight Worcestershire parishes and property in Gloucestershire. The latter went to Thomas Posthumous, whose wife was Margaret Hoby (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dakins), the diarist. She died in May or June 1609, and was buried at Bisham church on 2 June. Her memorial in Bisham church depicts her kneeling at a priedieu and wearing a coronet, with the figures of children from both marriages around her.<br>
