<span class="headword">Dinwiddie,  Robert</span>  (1692&#150;1770), <span class="occ">merchant and colonial administrator</span>, was born in Germiston, outside Glasgow, on 3 October 1692, one of nine children of Robert Dinwiddie (<i>d</i>. 1712), merchant in Glasgow, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Glasgow bailie Mathew Cumming of Carderock. Robert entered the transatlantic trade immediately following graduation in 1710/11 from the University of Glasgow, where he studied under John Law, professor of moral philosophy. The university later awarded him two honorary degrees.<br>
<br>In 1718 Dinwiddie settled in St George's parish, Bermuda, where he became one of the island's most substantial men. Like many industrious and enterprising eighteenth-century Scots, Dinwiddie sought his fortune in the service of the British crown. He began his public career in 1727 with his appointment by Horatio Walpole, brother of the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, as the collector of customs in Bermuda, at an annual salary of &pound;30.<br>
<br>Some time in the mid-1730s Dinwiddie married Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1793), only daughter of the Revd Andrew Auchinleck, member of the council of Bermuda, who also served three times as chief executive of the colony in the absence of a governor. Rebecca's mother came from the Tucker family, one of the most influential families in Bermuda. They had two daughters: Elizabeth, born in 1738, and Rebecca, born in 1742.<br>
<br>Dinwiddie corresponded frequently with the Board of Trade in London, commenting and advising on economic and political problems in the West Indies and America. In 1736 he suggested to the board that a special agent inspect and report on the American colonies. On 11 April 1738 Walpole appointed him &#145;Surveyor General of the Southern Part of the Continent of North America. Viz. South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Bahama Islands and Jamaica&#146;. In effect this post made him overseer of the British customs service for most of the British possessions in North America and the West Indies. The appointment was for life and carried an annual salary of more than &pound;300. As a result of this new post, Dinwiddie moved with his family in 1741 to Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained for five years before moving to London. He consigned his post of surveyor-general to the Virginian Peter Randolph in 1749. But Dinwiddie was not content with remaining outside of government service, and sought the lieutenant-governorship of Virginia. On 4 July 1751 his appointment was confirmed and he returned to the Old Dominion.<br>
<br>An ardent defender of British interests, Dinwiddie soon came into conflict with colonial Virginians. In 1752 controversy arose over the selection of a president for the College of William and Mary, the use of executive power, and Dinwiddie's plan to charge a fee of 1 pistole for every land grant he signed. Viewed by the lieutenant-governor as a legitimate and lucrative source of income for the Treasury, the fee was seen as a sign of Dinwiddie's greed by members of Virginia's house of burgesses. The conflict between royal authority and colonists' interests culminated during the threat of French occupation of the Ohio district in 1753. As lieutenant-governor Dinwiddie struggled to defend and expand the British empire against the French, and to strengthen the authority of the crown over Britain's colonies in North America. It was his decision to send a young Major George Washington to confront the French in the Ohio valley, and to demand their removal from land claimed by the British. The French refusal prompted the outbreak of the French and Indian War. Although he urged intercolonial support for common defence in the face of the French threat, Dinwiddie was constantly frustrated by the lack of co-operation. In response he called for parliamentary action for the royalization and the confederation of the American colonies for their common protection. To reassert the authority of the mother country he strongly advocated the levying of British taxes on the Americans to pay for their own defence but found his efforts limited by restrictions imposed by members of the general assembly.<br>
<br>Dinwiddie's efforts in the colonies affected his health, and he left Virginia on 12 January 1758 to return to England. He died at Hotwells at Clifton, near Bristol, on 27 July 1770, and was buried at the parish church of Clifton. Dinwiddie was a hard-working and talented colonial politician. His confrontations over revenue prompted early questions to be raised over the relationship between lieutenant-governors and colonial legislatures, and over the treatment of the colonies by the British government that eventually led to the American War of Independence.<br>
