<span class="headword">Hoskier,  Herman</span>  (1832&#150;1904), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was one of at least two sons and daughters of Herman Christian Hoskier, merchant, then based in Christiania, Norway. In 1840 Hoskier's family moved to Copenhagen and by 1846 he and his brother, Emile, were at school in Berlin. About 1848 he went to study in Florence. From an early age his outlook was cosmopolitan and he enjoyed fluency in at least French and English. On 8 February 1860, when working at Mobile in the USA, he married Elizabeth Catherine Byrne of New Orleans.<br>
<br>Hoskier's career began in 1850 with a short stint as a clerk in the Algiers branch of his father's house, H. C. Hoskier &amp; Son of Paris. Later that year he travelled to New York to join the merchants Dutilh &amp; Co. and in 1851 and 1853 spent time in London, latterly with C. Hambro &amp; Co., which at this time rescued his father's firm from ruin. Everard Hambro, later head of Hambros, became a close friend, and later Hoskier's executor. In 1854 Hoskier established Dutilh's Liverpool office, remaining as manager until 1857 and becoming friendly with Stewart Henry Brown.<br>
<br>Brown was a junior partner in Brown Shipley &amp; Co., the British end of the Brown family's leading north Atlantic merchant banking business, and in 1859 Hoskier was appointed Browns' agent at Mobile, dealing largely in cotton. Despite the outbreak of the civil war and the imposition of a blockade, Hoskier managed to secure the passage to Browns in Liverpool of some 30,000 bales of cotton, &#145;nearly the whole &hellip; balance of the year's cotton crop&#146;  (Crosby Brown, 275) thereby ensuring large profits on their sale in Britain. In June 1861 Hoskier, with his wife and child, undertook a hazardous journey to New York, from where he sailed to join Browns in Liverpool. Early in 1864 Hoskier and his colleague Mark Collet established Brown Shipley's London house, and Hoskier was a partner from 1866. The business flourished in those years, but Hoskier &#145;carries a heavy workload&#146; and was &#145;disposed to stand for what he considers his rights &amp; to go if he does not get them&#146;  (Kouwenhoven, 143). It was not surprising, therefore, that Hoskier in 1880 retired early from Brown Shipley, owing to a combination of ill health &#145;and other circumstances&#146;  (ibid.) and having &#145;sufficient for his wants&#146;  (Guildhall MS 20111&#150;20112).<br>
<br>By then Hoskier's transformation from merchant to merchant banker was complete and in the last two decades of the nineteenth century he established a well-founded reputation as a financier. The Union Bank of London, one of London's largest banks, appointed him a director in 1881, and he served until his death, but he declined its governorship in 1893. In 1886 he was appointed London director, largely concerned with finance, of Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Co. Ltd, one of the largest brewing businesses, on the eve of its flotation and on the recommendation of his friend Lord Revelstoke of Barings. Revelstoke reckoned him a &#145;first class man, clever, a gentleman and good at accounts&#146;  (History of Guinness). He served for a time as London agent for the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas and he was closely connected with his brother's Parisian bank, Emile Hoskier &amp; Cie.<br>
<br>Hoskier was at his most influential in the 1880s and 1890s, when he brought together underwriting syndicates for bond issues and other transactions in securities. His intimate connections with Brown Shipley, Hambros, Barings, and the Banque de Paris meant that he was able to act as an informal intermediary, in return for a one to two per cent commission. During the Baring crisis of 1890, the Bank of England, perhaps unaware of his friendship with Revelstoke, wanted him to investigate Barings' books, but his co-investigator, Bertram Currie, rejected him on account of an obvious conflict of interest.<br>
<br>After 1864 Hoskier lived at Queenswood, Blackheath, Roehampton, and finally at Coney Hill, Hayes Common, Kent. He had two sons, and at least one daughter. He died on 7 May 1904 at the Royal Pavilion Hotel, Folkestone, having been taken there the previous December after falling ill while travelling to Biarritz. Hoskier was survived by his wife.<br>
