<span class="headword">Lacy,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1664, <em>d.</em> 1730), <span class="occ">self-styled prophet</span>, was baptized on 30 May 1664 in Saffron Walden, Essex. He was the fifth son of Jerome Lacy (<i>fl</i>. 1630&#150;1670) and his wife, Elizabeth 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Pypes; <i>fl</i>. 1630&#150;1670)
  , formerly of Toppesfield, Essex. He acquired a rudimentary knowledge of Latin but, unlike his brothers, did not attend Cambridge University. In the early 1680s he became a successful London merchant, living at Tottenham. Soon after 3 April 1688 he married Susanna (<i>fl</i>. 1670?&#150;1715), daughter of Edward Rudge, and moved to St Giles, Middlesex, but no surviving children were born before 1699. As a member of the millenarian &#145;religious society for the reformation of manners&#146;, Lacy was associated with Anglicans, but he attended the Presbyterian chapel in Tothill Street, Westminster. In 1704 he actively supported Edmund Calamy's election as his chapel's minister, and also published a letter defending the practice of occasional conformity.<br>
<br>At a time when his situation was aggravated by the loss of a lawsuit Lacy espoused the cause of the French Prophets (Camisard refugees by origin), who had arrived in England in 1706 but whose utterances and miracles were dismissed as spurious by the Huguenot authorities. His translation of Fran&ccedil;ois Maximilien Misson's <span class="italic">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre sacr&eacute; des C&eacute;vennes</span> was published in March 1707 as <span class="italic">A Cry from the Desart</span>. In April, when a mob attacked some of the Prophets, Lacy and Sir Richard Bulkeley, another sympathizer, obtained a warrant for the arrest of some of the rioters, and in June Lacy rented the Barbican (formerly used by Presbyterians) as a licensed meeting-house for the French Prophets. However, to the consternation of his wife and others, Lacy soon believed himself, also, to be inspired. In July, shortly before three of the French Prophets were due to be tried on charges of blasphemy and sedition, Lacy began to prophesy in tongues, during which time his body was curiously agitated and contorted. His prophecies were delivered as the words of God speaking in the first person, and Lacy claimed that similar messages were contained in his automatic writing. His earlier prophecies, published in three instalments during 1707 as <span class="italic">Prophetical Warnings</span>, were preoccupied with the prospect of divine judgment. The third earl of Shaftesbury's <span class="italic">Letter Concerning Enthusiasm</span> (1708) originated from his observation of Lacy prophesying in poor Latin &#145;under an agitation&#146;  (&#145;Letter&#146;, 1.32). Although they were referred to as the French Prophets, Lacy was the first of several English enthusiasts involved with the movement. At times the leaders were faced with public hostility, as when Lacy's announcement that the guns of the Tower of London &#145;would roar in a few days&#146; proved to be a false alarm, and they temporarily withdrew from London to gather outside the capital. Although the Prophets performed ecclesiastical functions, Lacy was a reluctant separatist and later claimed that they had continued to frequent &#145;those several forms of Congregations, to which their Inclinations before used to lead them&#146;  (Lacy, <span class="italic">Relation</span>, 17).<br>
<br>Lacy's expectation of public rejection, and his concern for the encouragement of those within the movement, may help to explain his most notorious prediction. Early in December 1707, when three of the French Prophets were being publicly pilloried, another member of the sect, Thomas Emes, fell sick. Lacy announced that if he died, God would raise him. When Emes was buried in Bunhill Fields on 25 December another Prophet, rasher even than Lacy, predicted his resurrection on 25 May 1708, designating Lacy as the one who would raise him. For some Prophets, belief in the expected miracle became the acid test of commitment, but their claims were severely dismissed by critics including Edmund Calamy and William Whiston. By 29 April Lacy was acknowledging that several of his earlier predictions had been mistaken and he indicated that he would not be at the graveside on 25 May. The scornful incredulity of the unruly onlookers was later cited by Lacy as the hindrance which had prevented the miracle.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Lacy's domestic life was in crisis. Late in 1708 he petitioned parliament for a revision of his marriage settlement to benefit his four younger children. His brother Roger and relatives of his wife were among the trustees of the new settlement, which may have been prompted by their anxieties about Lacy's prophetic activities. Increasingly he found himself in the company of Elizabeth (Betty) Gray (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1692), whom he had claimed to cure of temporary blindness in 1707. Described by critics as &#145;a wild skittish girl&#146; and a &#145;pretty and hansome [<i>sic</i>] &hellip; young wench&#146;, she had been associated with the thespian world of Drury Lane (Kingston, 45; <span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.35). In a <span class="italic">Letter to Thomas Dutton</span> (a lawyer and one of the French Prophets), published in March 1711, Lacy explained that his wife's refusal to recognize his prophetic gifts was tantamount to fornication, and that he had therefore seen fit to take Betty Gray, &#145;a prophetess&#146;, to his bed. Thenceforth the trustees of his estate paid him an allowance with which he was able to move to Lancashire, where he lived and had two children with Betty Gray. His anonymous <span class="italic">General Delusion of Christians with Regard to Prophecy</span> (1713) was revised for a further defence of the French Prophets entitled <span class="italic">The Scene of Delusions</span> (1723). The extent of his audience may be gauged from a letter to Lacy written by Cotton Mather of Boston in 1719. Its tone is sympathetic, while troubled that the matters in Lacy's prophecies were &#145;too low, too mean, too trivial and jejune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 271). Lacy died in obscurity in the early months of 1730.<br>
