<span class="headword">Hope, Lady  Henrietta</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1786), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was born in Scotland, the second daughter of John, second earl of Hopetoun (1704&#150;1781), and his first wife, Lady Anne Ogilvy (<i>d</i>. 1759), the second daughter of James, earl of Findlater and Seafield. Her family consisted of eighteen brothers and sisters: nine full siblings and nine half-siblings. Recently converted, possibly through Darcy, Lady Maxwell, it was probably in October 1772 that she first met Willielma Campbell, Viscountess Glenorchy, and they became inseparable friends. Lady Glenorchy valued her advice greatly. In 1780 her father allowed Henrietta to join Lady Glenorchy, and on 17 May they left Edinburgh for London, where they visited Selina, countess of Huntingdon. Here Lady Glenorchy was taken ill, but by the end of June was well enough to travel on to Exmouth, Exeter, and Bath. From here they went to Hawkestone, Shropshire, to stay with Jane Hill, sister of the evangelical preacher Rowland Hill, before returning via Buxton to Scotland until November, when Lady Glenorchy returned to Bath. Lord Hopetoun having died in early 1781, his large family was dispersed, with Lady Henrietta going to London, where she made her home with Lady Glenorchy.<br>
<br>Both were keen to promote the cause of religion and, as they travelled around &#145;taking the waters&#146; for their health, they either visited churches Lady Glenorchy had already founded or started others. In 1784 Lady Glenorchy purchased a house in Matlock for use as a church and the following summer the friends took up residence there before going on to Bristol Hotwells in late September or early October. Here Henrietta's already poor health deteriorated; she became dropsical and suffered terribly during November and December before her death on 1 January 1786. The two ladies had planned to build a chapel at Hotwells, and Lady Henrietta left &pound;2500 towards the venture. Lady Glenorchy described the plan for &#145;a neat place of worship, plain but elegant and which will be a suitable monument for my dear friend, Lady Henrietta, and which I mean to call Hope Chapel&#146;  (Lady Glenorchy to Lady Maxwell, 26 Feb 1786, Jones, 508&#150;9). The building of the chapel was started, but Lady Glenorchy died on 17 July 1786 and her executrix, Lady Maxwell, carried out the friends' wishes. The structure, known as Hope Chapel, was opened on Granby Hill, Bristol, in August 1788. Lady Henrietta was described as having &#145;a happy temper and high accomplishments, she was distinguished for sagacity and prudence, talents which she inherited from her father&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life and Times of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon</span>, 2 vols., 1840).<br>
