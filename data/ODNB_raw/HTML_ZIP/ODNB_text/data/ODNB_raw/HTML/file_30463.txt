<span class="headword">Arthur,  William</span>  (1819&#150;1901), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 3 February 1819 at Glendun, Antrim, the son of James Arthur, whose ancestors came from counties Limerick and Clare, and his wife, Margaret Kennedy, who was of Scottish and Ulster descent. He grew up in Kells, Antrim, and moved with his parents to Newport, co. Mayo, at the age of twelve. Brought up as an Episcopalian, he became a Wesleyan Methodist and began to preach before his sixteenth birthday. In 1837 he entered Hoxton Academy to train as a Wesleyan minister. He became committed to the cause of overseas mission and sailed for India on 15 April 1839 under the auspices of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. In India he was based at Gubbi, about 80 miles north-west of Bangalore, but his health gave way and he returned to England in 1841. Although his sojourn in India lasted for less than two years, it was, on his own admission, probably the most important period of his life. In 1843 he was stationed at Wesley's chapel in City Road, London. From 1846 to 1849 he was a Wesleyan missionary in France, first at Boulogne and then in Paris. In 1849 and 1850 his ministry was in London, at Hinde Street and Great Queen Street. From 1851 to 1868 he was one of the secretaries of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, and he was an honorary secretary from 1871 to 1888. From 1868 to 1871 he was principal of the Methodist college, Belfast.<br>
<br>Arthur was elected a member of the effective leaders of the Wesleyan Methodists, the legal hundred, in 1856, and was president of the Wesleyan conference in 1866. In 1888 he settled at Cannes, where he preached occasionally in the Presbyterian church. On 18 June 1850 he married Elizabeth Ellis Ogle (<i>d</i>. 1888), from Leeds. They had five daughters. He died at Cannes on 9 March 1901.<br>
<br>Portraits of Arthur in his later years show him as a slender, balding figure with deep-set blue eyes and a kindly expression. Within the Wesleyan pastorate he had a reputation for generosity, holiness, and integrity. As a theologian he was praised more for his intuition than for his powers of reasoned argument. Although he was committed to a punishing schedule of preaching, administration, and writing, ill health plagued him all his life and frequently determined the type and geographical location of his ministry. He suffered from poor eyesight, serious throat problems, and an unspecified chest illness. Unsurprisingly, over time his writings came to have more influence than his actions.<br>
<br>Arthur's chief interests, reflected in his published works, lay in domestic and foreign missions, education, and Christian apologetics. Besides prolific contributions to reviews and magazines he published some thirty pamphlets on theological and political subjects; his eleven books included <span class="italic">A Mission to the Mysore</span> (1847), <span class="italic">The Tongue of Fire</span> (1856), <span class="italic">The Life of Gideon Ouseley</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Pope, the Kings and the People</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">Women's Work in India</span> (1882). He was an honorary secretary of the Evangelical Alliance and played an important part in organizing the first international ecumenical Methodist conference at Wesley's chapel in London in 1881. He was a vigorous opponent of slavery, Anglo-Catholicism, and Roman Catholicism, and an equally vigorous supporter of temperance (he was a vice-president of the United Kingdom Alliance), sabbatarianism, and religious education. He maintained a lifelong interest in his native Ireland from a stoutly protestant perspective and unsurprisingly he sided with those nonconformists who rejected Gladstone's proposals for home rule in 1886. He was, in short, narrowly protestant in his religious sympathies, but engagingly internationalist in his vision for a Christian world order.<br>
