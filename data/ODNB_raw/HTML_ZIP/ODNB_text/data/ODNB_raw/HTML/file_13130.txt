<span class="headword">Heslop,  Luke</span>  (1738&#150;1825), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born and baptized on St Luke's day (18 October) 1738, in Yorkshire. He was admitted as a sizar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 3 May 1760 and was appointed chapel clerk on 31 October following; he also acted as temporary librarian for an interval, a responsible position for an, admittedly older, undergraduate. Heslop was subsequently elected to the Archbishop Sterne scholarship on 19 October 1764 and also held a Spencer scholarship. He became a fellow of Corpus on 26 January 1769. He was senior wrangler in 1764, and graduated BA in 1764, MA in 1767, and BD in 1775. Heslop was an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of chemistry in 1771, but served as moderator of the university for the tripos examinations of 1772 and 1773. He was ordained deacon (Norwich diocese) on 13 May 1764 and subsequently priest, serving as curate of Gislingham, Suffolk, in 1764.<br>
<br>On 31 December 1772 Heslop married Dorothy, daughter of the Revd Dr Thomas Reeve FRCP (1700&#150;1780), and thereafter his career took shape outside Cambridge. On 28 September 1776 he was collated prebendary in St Paul's Cathedral, having been previously collated to the vicarage of St Peter-le-Poer (within the jurisdiction of the peculiar of the dean and chapter of St Paul's) on 21 June 1775. Heslop owed much to the patronage of John Green, bishop of Lincoln (1761&#150;79) and formerly master of Corpus (1750&#150;63), who appointed Heslop his examining chaplain and, on 2 September 1778, collated him to the archdeaconry of Buckingham, to which a prebendal stall at Lincoln (Heydour-cum-Walton) was attached. Heslop was inducted, on 9 January 1777, to the benefice of Adstock, Buckinghamshire (also in the gift of the bishop of Lincoln), which he held until 1803 with the rectory of the adjacent village of Addington, to which he was presented by Dame Anne Tynte and inducted on 31 March 1792, thereupon resigning the benefice of St Peter-le-Poer. He also acted as a magistrate in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>In 1804 Heslop resigned his living of Addington on becoming rector of Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, on the presentation of the dean and chapter of Windsor. The same year he additionally accepted the valuable rectory of Bothal, Northumberland, which he was awarded through the influence of the third duke of Portland, his neighbour in Buckinghamshire and lord president of the council in Henry Addington's administration. Heslop resigned Bothal in 1809 on being appointed rector of the extra-episcopal parish of St Marylebone, Middlesex, also in Portland's gift. He at once removed to London to devote himself to his overgrown parish (the rectory and its patronage were sold by the fourth duke to the crown in 1817). Heslop saw the necessity of parochial reorganization. In 1820 he proposed to the commissioners for building new churches that his parish should be split into four parts with district chapels in each one, the whole under the jurisdiction of the bishop of London. In 1810 he was awarded his last piece of patronage when he was named rector of both St Stephen's and St Augustine's, Bristol. His constitution was vigorous and he hardly suffered from ill health until aged over eighty, though he held no visitation of the Buckingham archdeaconry after 1809. He died, at 27 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 23 June 1825, aged eighty-six, and was buried in the new church of St Marylebone, opened in 1817 and designed to fit into the grand Regent's Park scheme of Thomas Nash. Despite his numerous preferments he died a comparatively poor man. Dorothy Heslop died at Bury St Edmunds on 28 December 1827, aged seventy-nine, and was survived by one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Heslop was the author of two sermons and a charge (1807). He took a lifelong interest in political economy and published <span class="italic">Observations on the Statute of 31 Geo. II, c. 29, Concerning the Assize of Bread</span> (1799); <span class="italic">A Comparative Statement of the Food Produced from Arable and Grass Land and the Returns from each, with Observations on Inclosures and the Effect of an Act for Enclosing Commons</span> (1801); and <span class="italic">Observations on the Duty of Property, Professions, &amp; c. to Render its Assessment Simple, and to Improve it</span> (1805). He was awarded a Lambeth DD by Archbishop Manners-Sutton in 1810.<br>
