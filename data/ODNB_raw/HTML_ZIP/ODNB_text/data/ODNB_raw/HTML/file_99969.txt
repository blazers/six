<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keenan,  Brian Paschal</span>  (1941&#150;2008), <span class="occ">Irish republican activist</span>, was born on 17 July 1941 in Dysert, Draperstown, co. Londonderry, the son of Henry Keenan, an accountant then serving as a warrant officer in the RAF and stationed at RAF Pocklington, Yorkshire, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McAlea. Keenan's Roman Catholic family were from Belfast's New Lodge Road area, but evacuated to co. Derry following the Belfast blitz. The family returned to Belfast at the end of the war. At sixteen Keenan began an apprenticeship as an electronics engineer, joining the Electrical Trade Union. He later observed that &#145;from a young age my political outlook was shaped by my interest in trade unions&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Phoblacht</span>, 27 March 2008). In 1958 he moved to England, continuing his training at a Luton firm making guided missiles. Keenan also worked for a time in partnership with his brother as a television repairman in Corby, Northamptonshire. During his time in Corby he damaged a cigarette machine, leaving his fingerprints in the process. On 19 October 1960 he married, at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Luton, Christine (Chrissie) Campbell, a machinist in a clothing factory, daughter of Frank Campbell, labourer. They had two sons and four daughters. They returned to Belfast in 1963.<br>
<br>Keenan spent two weeks in Belfast's Crumlin Road prison in 1964, after being arrested during the Divis Street riots. He was asked to contribute a document on trade unionism to the 1966 IRA army convention but did not join the IRA until 1968. He saw &#145;republicanism [as] an ideology which should be firmly fixed socially and economically&#146;. His view was that &#145;the enemy was capitalism and the system of exploitation&#146;, and he believed that &#145;the national question was always a class question&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Phoblacht</span>, 27 March 2008). The &#145;trigger for my generation to get involved in violent confrontation with the state was not the IRA, not republican politics, nor republican ideology. The trigger was the Civil Rights movement&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Phoblacht</span>, 3 April 2008).<br>
<br>By August 1971 Keenan was quartermaster of the IRA's Belfast brigade. His search for armaments included visiting Libya in 1972, establishing a contact which would prove highly valuable to the IRA. He was appointed IRA quartermaster-general the following year. In mid-1974 he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment in the Republic of Ireland for membership of the IRA. He was wounded during an escape attempt on 17 March 1975 but was released that July. Sean Callaghan, a former IRA member turned police informer, later claimed that Keenan wanted the IRA to retaliate severely for increasing sectarian attacks on Catholics by loyalist paramilitaries in the south Armagh area. Keenan argued (Callaghan claimed) that the only way &#145;to put the nonsense out of the Prods [Protestants] was to just hit back much harder and more savagely than them&#146;  (Harnden, 134). This led to the Kingsmill massacre of 5 January 1976, in which ten Protestant workmen were murdered. The atrocity was claimed by the &#145;South Armagh Republican Action Force&#146;, believed to have been a cover name for the local IRA unit. In the wake of Kingsmill sectarian attacks ended locally, allegedly owing to an agreement reached by local units of the IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force. However, the attack had been carried out without the knowledge of the IRA army council and proved highly controversial within the republican movement itself. Gerry Adams insisted that there must &#145;never again be another Kingsmill&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>By 1977 Keenan had become IRA director of operations and a supporter of Gerry Adams on the IRA army council. Together with Martin McGuinness, Keenan travelled the country speaking in support of Adams's &#145;long war&#146; plan to reorganize the IRA. The IRA's English bombing campaign of the 1970s was run by Keenan. His fingerprints, on file since the incident in Corby, were found on a list of bomb parts discovered in follow-up raids after the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege. Arrested in Northern Ireland in March 1979, Keenan was sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment on 25 June 1980, for conspiracy to cause explosions. Ironically part of this sentence was served in HMP Long Sutton, which had been constructed on the former RAF station Long Sutton, where his father had once served. Despite being in prison Keenan continued to wield influence within the IRA, supporting republican electoral participation and Adams's candidacy in the 1982 Northern Ireland assembly elections, in the face of doubts by the IRA's army council.<br>
<br>Keenan was released from prison in June 1993, and by 1996 was back on the IRA army council. He was a member of the army council that authorized the Docklands bombing of 9 February 1996, which ended the first IRA ceasefire, but this was probably a tactical necessity at this point to avoid a split within the IRA. Similarly, at the IRA general army convention in October 1996 Keenan adopted an anti-Adams line, only to switch sides once he had been elected to the IRA army executive. He supported the calling of a second ceasefire during a meeting between the IRA army council and the IRA army executive on 16 July 1997. Peter Taylor, in <span class="italic">Brits</span> (2002), interpreted anti-decommissioning speeches made by Keenan as a strategy to prevent IRA volunteers from defecting. Adams later asserted that there &#145;wouldn't be a peace process if it wasn't for Brian Keenan&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 May 2008).<br>
<br>Once described as &#145;the biggest single threat to the British state&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Phoblacht</span>, 3 April 2008), Keenan was a militarist, but was also highly political. The choice between the bomb or the ballot box was likely tactical and dictated by pragmatic, rather than ideological, considerations. His last years were blighted by cancer, and he resigned from the army council in 2005. He died at 52 St Patricks Park, Cullyhanna, co. Armagh, on 21 May 2008. An atheist by the end of his life, he was cremated on 24 May at Roselawn crematorium, Belfast, following a secular service.<br>
