<span class="headword">Rawdon,  Christopher</span>  (1780&#150;1858), <span class="occ">businessman and benefactor of a fund for Unitarian ministers</span>, was born at Halifax on 13 April 1780, the eldest son of Christopher and Sophia Rawdon. His father (<i>d</i>. 1822), the sixth in succession with this name, owned mills at Underbank, near Todmorden, Yorkshire. Rawdon was educated in Switzerland (1787&#150;90) and at Mr Catlow's school at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1793). In 1793 his father met a Portuguese gentleman at Falmouth, and, in order to improve their children's knowledge of foreign languages, they agreed to exchange sons for a year. The elder Rawdon dispatched home the following letter: &#145;Dear Wife,&#151;Deliver to the bearer thy first-born. Christopher Rawdon&#146;. His wife &#145;knew too well the decision of her husband's character to hesitate a moment in yielding obedience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, 1858, 738). After a year at Lisbon and further schooling at Mansfield (1794&#150;7), Rawdon in 1797 became manager at Underbank. In 1807 he went to Portugal as representative of his father's firm, and held this position until 1823, when he settled in Liverpool. He married, on 23 October 1821, Charlotte (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1796), daughter of Rawdon Briggs, banker, of Halifax, and his wife, Ann.<br>
<br>Rawdon was a successful man of business, a member of the Liverpool town council for three years, and a borough and county magistrate. In politics he was an active Liberal, in religion an assertive Unitarian. The <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Act</span> of 1844 finally established the right, after decades of litigation, of Unitarians to the possession of their old meeting-houses together with associated endowments. However, the act did not prevent the removal of Unitarians from the Lady Hewley Trust, and many ministers suffered financial hardship as a result. Rawdon therefore decided to create a new fund for the benefit of Unitarian ministers serving congregations in the north of England. The successful formation of the trust from the will of Robert Hibbert in 1853, which fostered the best entrants to the Unitarian ministry, prompted Rawdon and his brother James (1782&#150;1855) to donate &pound;1000, which was later doubled, towards the creation of a fund to aid poorer ministers. In the following year appeals in the press and elsewhere soon increased the total to nearly &pound;19,000. This large sum was made into the Ministers' Stipend Augmentation Fund in 1856, in the control of trustees, to benefit Unitarian ministers serving congregations north of the River Trent. A pioneering venture at this time within dissent, the trust still continued to fulfil its original purpose some 150 years later.<br>
<br>Rawdon died at Elm House, Anfield, Liverpool, on 22 October 1858, and was buried at Toxteth Park Chapel, Liverpool. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> stated, &#145;Many a poor minister, in his struggles and discouragements, will think in gratitude of him&#146;.<br>
