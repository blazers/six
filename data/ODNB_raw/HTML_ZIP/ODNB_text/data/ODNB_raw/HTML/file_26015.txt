<span class="headword">Somerset,  William</span>, third earl of Worcester  (1526/7&#150;1589), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest of the four sons of Henry Somerset, second earl of Worcester (1495/6&#150;1549), and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1502&#150;1565), daughter of Sir Anthony Browne (<i>d</i>. 1506), and sister of the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3665/', "Sir Anthony Browne")</script>. William's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26004/', "Charles Somerset, the first earl of Worcester (c.1460&#150;1526)")</script> of the Somerset creation, acquired extensive lands in south Wales through his marriage with a Herbert heiress, and his influence as Henry VIII's lord chamberlain ensured that his heir, Henry, was granted life tenure of many royal offices in the marches of Wales. Lord Herbert, as he was styled, probably spent his unrecorded early years mainly on his father's lands in Monmouthshire. In 1544 he served with his father in the English army in France, carrying the king's helm and spear at Calais on 25 July, and in December 1545 he attended the king at Westminster. In May 1546 he was among those who &#145;brake their staves and did very honestly&#146; in a skirmish near Boulogne, but he was too diffident to revenge an insult when visiting Fontainebleau in July 1546 with the English embassy. In 1546 he appears as a member of the privy chamber and was bequeathed &pound;200 in Henry VIII's will. He attended Henry VIII's funeral and was knighted by Edward VI at his coronation.<br>
<br>Following his father's death on 26 November 1549, the young Earl William, who was then twenty-two, failed to secure appointment to his father's valuable offices in Wales. His landed income was smaller than that of most contemporary earls, and in the 1550s family and other expenses led to land sales and debts. These were relieved by royal pardons in 1552 and 1558 and by assistance from his father-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20300/', "Sir Edward North")</script>, created Lord North in 1554, who was later credited with disbursing &pound;2000 or &pound;3000 for his relief. His marriage to North's daughter Christian (<i>b</i>. 1533) probably took place late in 1549. They had three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26005/', "Edward Somerset, fourth earl of Worcester")</script>, Elizabeth, and Lucy. In November 1563 Worcester's disagreement with his wife came to the queen's notice, and in December 1563 they separated on terms which required Worcester to pay the countess &pound;100 a year, rising to &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. after his mother's death. Three illegitimate children are also recorded for Worcester.<br>
<br>In May 1551 Worcester accompanied the marquess of Northampton's embassy to the French court. He was one of many signatories of the letters patent of 21 June 1553 settling the crown on Lady Jane Grey, but was present at the proclamation of Queen Mary on 19 July 1553 and served as carver at her coronation. In February 1554 the Spanish ambassador reported that when Wyatt's rebellion threatened London, Worcester had fled the court crying all was lost. Soon afterwards, possibly to counter suspicions that his action at that time reflected opposition to the queen's marriage, he sought leave to visit Spain and was one of those who escorted Prince Philip from Spain to his wedding with the queen. In 1557 he showed his commitment to the reigning monarchs by serving in the army in France commanded by the earl of Pembroke.<br>
<br>In Elizabeth's reign Worcester continued to undertake public duties and regularly attended parliament. He was reputed to be a Catholic and this probably explains his omission until about 1577 from the Elizabethan commissions appointing the council in the marches of Wales, of which he had been a member since 1551. Until his reappointment to that council he was also omitted from all Elizabethan commissions of the peace except those for Monmouthshire, despite his importance as a landowner in Glamorgan, Brecknockshire, and Gloucestershire. His Catholic sympathies were shown in 1566 by his opposition to the bill affirming the validity of the consecration of bishops appointed since Elizabeth's accession. In 1569 the northern insurgents spread unfounded rumours that he was raising men in Wales, but his nomination as a knight of the Garter on 23 April 1570 may be seen as recognition of his loyalty.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1572 Worcester was appointed one of the peers for the trial of the duke of Norfolk. In January 1573 he was sent to France to be proxy for Queen Elizabeth at the christening of Charles IX's daughter, and when in Paris demonstrated his loyalty to the queen by refusing to meet his sister Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107539/', "Percy, Anne, countess of Northumberland")</script>], the widow of the attainted earl of Northumberland. In October 1586 he was one of the commissioners at Fotheringhay for the trial of Mary, queen of Scots, and in July 1588 he undertook to bring into the field six lances and twenty-four light horse for the queen's defence. He died at his house at St John's, in or near the parish of Clerkenwell, Middlesex, on 21 February 1589, and was buried in Raglan parish church, having directed in his will that he was &#145;there to lye alone&#146;.<br>
<br>After 1551 Worcester was the only peer who mainly resided in Wales. In the 1560s he moved his permanent residence from Chepstow Castle to Raglan Castle, where in the 1580s he undertook extensive rebuilding reflecting the recovery of his finances. The long gallery built at that time incorporates caryatids based on illustrations in a French architectural book in his possession, which he probably acquired in France in 1573. His local influence was shown in the election of his brothers as members of parliament for Monmouthshire: Thomas in 1553 and 1554, Francis in 1558, and Charles in 1571 and 1572. His letters show him on sociable terms with several peerage and gentry families. He was patron of a company of players which performed widely in the provinces from 1556 until 1585, and also of the poets Lewys Morgannwg (Llywelyn ap Rhisiart) and Dafydd Benwyn.<br>
