<span class="headword">Ward,  James</span>  (1769&#150;1859), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born on 23 October 1769 in Thames Street, London, the middle of five children of James Ward, fruit merchant, and his wife, Rachael (1736/7&#150;1835). He was baptized at All Hallows-the-Great, Upper Thames Street, on 12 November, that same year.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandtraining"></a>Early life and training</h2>Ward's father was intemperate in his habits, and, as a result, at the time of James's birth the family's fortunes had declined. Although his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28711/', "William Ward")</script>, attended school, Ward did not, and in later years he was self-conscious about his lack of formal education. When he was twelve he was apprenticed, like his brother William, to the engraver John Raphael Smith, although Ward subsequently claimed that he had little encouragement from his master, and his apprenticeship was terminated after fewer than two years because of problems between them. He completed his indenture with his brother. It was during his apprenticeship to Smith that James demonstrated his artistic ability, reportedly reproducing from memory a drawing by Henry Fuseli. The few extant drawings from this period attest to his youthful skills.<br>
<br>From the outset of his career Ward was a successful and highly respected mezzotint engraver of works by other artists. However, engravers were not eligible for election to the Royal Academy, and Ward therefore decided to abandon his lucrative career as an interpreter of the works of others and to dedicate himself to painting. The artists who employed Ward tried to persuade him to remain a printmaker, and he continued to create prints, especially after his own compositions; in the 1820s he also became a very accomplished lithographer. Ward donated a large collection of his prints in various states to the British Museum. In 1794 he was appointed painter and engraver in mezzotint to the prince of Wales. On 4 December he married Mary Ann Ward (<i>d</i>. 1819; no relation) at the parish church of St Marylebone, London.<br>
<br>Of the several children of James and Mary Ann Ward, <a name="cosubject_28684"></a><span class="headword">George Raphael Ward</span>  (1799&#150;1878) became a <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>. He was born on 17 July 1799 and was baptized on 8 November that year at St Mary's, St Marylebone Road. After studying under his father in 1822 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, when his age was given as twenty-one. The following year he won a silver medal at the Society of Arts and continued to exhibit, particularly at the Royal Academy and New Water Colour Society until 1864. On 30 December 1827 he married Mary Webb, with whom he had a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45579/', "Henrietta Mary Ada Ward (1832&#150;1924)")</script>, also an artist, who became the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28683/', "Edward Matthew Ward (1816&#150;1879)")</script>, historical genre painter. George Ward became a miniaturist and engraver, and made copies in miniature after portraits by Sir Thomas Lawrence. He signed these G. R. Ward and on some gave his address as 7 Newman Street, Oxford Street. Foskett commented of that &#145;at its best [his work] is good&#146;, his &#145;colours pleasant with blue-grey shadows&#146;; some works, she noted, were executed &#145;in a continental style of painting&#146;  (Foskett, 671). Walter Armstrong noted that Ward was &#145;better known, however, by his engraved portraits, which show considerable skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Examples of his mezzotint engravings are in the National Portrait Gallery's collection. George Ward died on 18 December 1878.<h2>
<a name="Earlypaintingcareer"></a>Early painting career</h2>Ward's painting career is traditionally divided into two phases, the first dominated by the influence of George Morland, his brother-in-law, the second by Peter Paul Rubens, the great seventeenth-century Flemish master. However, such a division oversimplifies Ward's artistic development. When the young Ward began painting about 1790 both his subject matter and painting style were indebted to Morland. An early work such as <span class="italic">Old Grey Horse and Ass</span> (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;3; V&amp;A) demonstrates, in both its rustic subject matter and its style with loose brushwork, soft forms, and limited palette, how strong this influence was. Ward resented being labelled a student of Morland since he claimed that his brother-in-law, fearing competition, had taught him nothing. His so-called Rubensian phase was ushered in by his seeing in 1803 Rubens's <span class="italic">Ch&acirc;teau de Steen</span> (National Gallery, London). The picture had recently been acquired by the connoisseur Sir George Beaumont, and was in the studio of Ward's neighbour in Newman Street, Benjamin West, president of the Royal Academy. In response to this work Ward painted <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting with a View of St Donat's Castle in the Background</span> (1803; V&amp;A).<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Ward was much influenced by the loosely painted rustic genre scenes of Morland and the richly colored baroque compositions of Rubens. However, the sources of Ward's mature style were numerous and diverse; they ranged from the Elgin marbles and other classical sculpture to old masters including Titian, Van Dyck, Paulus Potter, and Rembrandt as well as Rubens. He also studied animal and human anatomy and sketched constantly from nature. In the mid-1790s Ward had access to the Orl&eacute;ans collection that had come to England from revolutionary France to be sold; he engraved a number of the works for the art dealer Michael Bryan. Ward subsequently painted Bryan's family group portrait (<i>c</i>.1797&#150;8; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne), which shows the impact of Titian's palette on his early style. He was also familiar with the work of his British predecessors and contemporaries such as George Stubbs and P. J. de Loutherbourg, and occasionally looked to them for compositional and technical ideas. Ward's animal portraits are particularly indebted to Stubbs's compositions in which a horse or a dog is silhouetted against an expansive landscape, while a heightening of his colour reveals an admiration for the dramatic intensity of de Loutherbourg's palette.<br>
<br>At the turn of the century Ward created a series of paintings for the board of agriculture which set out to record the various breeds of livestock in Britain; the compositions were then engraved by Boydell. This undertaking clearly had nationalistic overtones during a period of ongoing hostilities with France. Championed by Lord Somerville, one of Ward's earliest patrons, the project was never completed. The paintings, for example <span class="italic">A Durham Bull</span> (<i>c</i>.1802; Nottingham Castle Museum), often incorporated landscape vignettes that are reminiscent of the compositions of Thomas Bewick, and their composition, fluidity of brushwork, rich coloration, and meticulous rendering of detail suggest Ward's many sources. Tireless in his efforts to gather information on British livestock, Ward travelled extensively throughout England. In the process he executed a large body of drawings that he utilized throughout his long life.<br>
<br>Ward hoped to establish his reputation with <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting</span> and <span class="italic">Liboya Serpent Seizing its Prey</span> (lost). The latter, painted on a monumental scale, depicted a serpent wrapping itself around an African seated on a white horse. Both these paintings may have had allegorical meanings with the former perhaps alluding to the current struggle between France and England and the latter to the evils of the slave trade. Ward was sympathetic to the anti-slavery movement and counted among his associates some of its leaders. <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting</span> is one of the earliest examples of Ward's use of parallel emotions in humans and animals, a common artistic conceit of the time, to underscore the drama taking place. Instead of gaining the approval of the artistic establishment, <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting</span> and <span class="italic">Liboya Serpent</span> brought on a temporary rupture with the Royal Academy. In part owing to its size, <span class="italic">Liboya Serpent</span> was rejected for exhibition and <span class="italic">Bulls Fighting</span> was relegated to an undesirable position. In a pique, Ward requested that he be allowed to withdraw the latter, and his petition was reluctantly granted. The rift was soon healed, however, as Ward recognized the importance of the academy to his professional future, and successfully sought amends through the diarist and painter Joseph Farington, as well as through other academicians. Ward was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1807, and was made a full academician in 1811. By this time he had established himself as an animal painter of the first order and his accomplishments could not be ignored by the art establishment, although some of his fellow artists found him vulgar.<h2>
<a name="Middleperiod"></a>Middle period</h2>Ward's portrait of a celebrated stallion, <span class="italic">Eagle</span> (1809; Yale U. CBA) was critical in establishing his reputation. The <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>'s opinion was that the painting established Ward as &#145;the first of English animal painters now living&#146;  (1811, 265). <span class="italic">Eagle</span> exudes the power and force typical of Ward's finest animal portraits and with its anatomical detail and rich colouring also reveals some of the influences that shaped Ward's mature style. Shown in profile, the horse dominates a vast Rubensian landscape that seems to stretch to infinity beneath a brilliant Venetian-coloured sky.<br>
<br>Works such as <span class="italic">Eagle</span> brought Ward numerous patrons from the merchant class, landed gentry, and aristocracy. His one surviving account book, now on deposit at the Royal Academy, covers the period 1804 to 1827, when Ward became one of Britain's greatest animal painters. The majority of the commissions were for horse portraits, but the book also details paintings of other animals as well as landscapes and genre subjects. Ward also produced several major religious and history pictures at this time, such as <span class="italic">The Waterloo Allegory</span>, <span class="italic">Pool of Bethesda</span>, and <span class="italic">Battle near Boston</span>. The records of both the Royal Academy and the British Institution from these decades also suggest the artist's activity and ambition through the number of works exhibited and the subjects treated.<br>
<br>Despite receiving recognition as an outstanding animal painter Ward told Farington that he did not &#145;wish to be admitted to the Academy as a Horse-Painter&#146;, which he considered a lower form of art  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 20 June 1811). The painting Ward submitted as his diploma piece, <span class="italic">A Bacchanalian</span> (1811; RA), underscores his aspirations. Although such works can be appreciated for their technical facility, they do not today occupy a high place in his <i>&#339;uvre</i> nor were they generally admired at the time. On the other hand, Ward's animal paintings remain among the finest works he created and justify his being considered a major artist of the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1810s and 1820s Ward remained in great demand as a horse painter. Among the most important of his works are the portraits he made of horses in the early 1820s, especially those related to the combatants of the Napoleonic wars: Napoleon's charger Marengo (1824; priv. coll.); the duke of Wellington's Copenhagen (priv. coll.); and George IV's Nonpareil (Royal Collection). Although portraits of specific animals, the horses and landscapes also symbolized their owners. When exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1826, the landscape in the painting of Marengo (Napoleon's charger) was said to be emblematic of Napoleon's downfall. The setting sun and the horse's agitated appearance as it stares across a dark sea underscore the painting's message. When seen with <span class="italic">Copenhagen</span> (1824), it is clear that the two pictures were intended as companion pieces with Napoleon's steed looking to the right with fear across the channel at the horse of the duke of Wellington. <span class="italic">Copenhagen</span> is posed in a rolling English landscape, calm but wary, clearly prepared for what might happen. <span class="italic">Nonpareil</span> (1824) is placed in a landscape with Windsor in the background. The horse in proud majesty stands sentinel over its domain. These three portraits belong to a series of pictures of celebrated horses published as lithographs by Ackermann in 1823&#150;4.<h2>
<a name="GordaleScarandTheWaterlooAllegory"></a>Gordale Scar and The Waterloo Allegory</h2>In the two decades following his election as academician Ward produced some of his finest works. The subject matter varied enormously. In addition to animal paintings such as <span class="italic">Eagle</span> and portraits of men and animals hunting in a landscape, for example <span class="italic">Theophilus Levett and a Favourite Hunter</span> (1817; Yale U. CBA), Ward also attempted some of his most ambitious and monumental canvases, including <span class="italic">Gordale Scar</span> (1812&#150;14; Tate collection), <span class="italic">The Waterloo Allegory</span> (1815&#150;21), for which now only a large finished study exists (1815; Royal Hospital, Chelsea), and <span class="italic">Group of Cattle</span> (1822; Tate collection).<br>
<br>Commissioned by Lord Ribblesdale, whose son, Thomas Lister, studied with Ward, <span class="italic">Gordale Scar</span> depicts a dramatic site in Yorkshire. It is Ward's masterpiece. Guarded over by an aboriginal white bull and populated with a host of animals that could not fit within the topographical limitations of the actual scar, the dark and towering scene is a fine example of the sublime in British art. Other landscapes by Ward from the same period reflect the aesthetic ideas of the beautiful (<span class="italic">Tabley Lake and Tower</span>, 1814; Tate collection) and picturesque (<span class="italic">A Cow-Layer: Evening after Rain</span>, also called <span class="italic">Cattle-Piece? Marylebone Park</span>, 1807; Tate collection) that were also current at the time.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Waterloo Allegory</span> was commissioned by the British Institution after a competition to commemorate the victory of Wellington over Napoleon at Waterloo. Reportedly cut up when it was returned to Ward's descendants about 1880, it was a gigantic canvas that measured 21 &times; 35 feet. Its complex iconography, which includes a portrait of the duke of Wellington, representations of Britannia, and the visualizations of abstract concepts such as religion, charity, and envy, was adapted from a variety of sources, and the overall composition is indebted to Rubens's <span class="italic">The Sacrament Triumphant over Ignorance and Blindness</span>. The painting's apocalyptic imagery as well as the elaborate explanation reflect to some extent the ideas of the German mystic Jacob B&ouml;hme. Exhibited in London with an admission fee at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, <span class="italic">The Waterloo Allegory</span> was a failure, financially and critically. Angered by the response, Ward set out to prove his detractors wrong by painting <span class="italic">Group of Cattle</span> (1822; Tate collection), a life-size canvas conceived to compete with Paulus Potter's <span class="italic">Young Bull</span> (Mauritshuis, The Hague). This monumental painting (129&frac12; &times; 191 inches) was purchased by the National Gallery in 1862; it has not been on view for decades. As in many of Ward's paintings, the animals take on an almost anthropomorphic quality, and in subsequent works such as <span class="italic">The Deer-Stealer</span> (1822; Tate collection), <span class="italic">Day's Sport</span> (1826; Yale U. CBA), and <span class="italic">L'amour du cheval</span> (1827; Tate collection), he explored even further than he had in the past parallel emotions between man and beast.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>When Ward was working on <span class="italic">The Waterloo Allegory</span> his wife and two of his children died. With personal tragedy and professional problems, the artist turned increasingly to religion for solace and subjects. However, he still sought and executed animal portraits. In the late 1820s and 1830s he travelled to Newmarket and other parts of East Anglia in search of commissions. Letters and notebooks dealing with these trips are in the Research Library at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles. On 27 October 1827 Ward married Charlotte Fritche (<i>b</i>. before 1778), a family friend. Three years later the couple retired to Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Prior to the departure for Cheshunt, Ward sold at Christies many works from his studio and rented out his house in Newman Street. Now aged sixty, the artist was clearly putting his life in order. There were many reasons for the move from London, not least of which were his wife's preference for country life and financial problems involving his children. But Ward also had an apocalyptic view of the future, and he expressed these sentiments in letters to friends and in the treatise <span class="italic">New Trial of the Spirits</span> (1835), which was a defence of Edward Irving, whose Catholic Apostolic Church was near Ward's house in Newman Street. Convinced that he was one of the elect and with strong millenarian beliefs, Ward saw in contemporary events signs of the second coming and warnings about the approaching end of the world.<br>
<br>Ward considered painting his religious duty. Although he continued to portray animals and regularly sent works to exhibition, he became increasingly divorced from the art world and his non-commissioned works were often religious. <span class="italic">Intercession</span> (1837), which depicted Christ at the last few moments on the cross, was so criticized when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy that Ward was stung into response. The next year eight works, all somehow dealing with this slight, were exhibited. The most pertinent was <span class="italic">Tickling the Ear</span> (1838), in which a monkey (critic) sitting on the back of a bull (British public) tickles the animal's ear with a peacock feather (flattery). <span class="italic">Ignorance, Envy and Jealousy</span>, formerly <span class="italic">Miranda and Caliban</span> (1837; Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford upon Avon), dealt with the critic's calumny concerning Ward's religious beliefs; the iconography is indebted to B&ouml;hme.<br>
<br>Not infrequently Ward's exhibition pictures had lengthy explanations or poems, written by the artist, in the catalogue. He also wrote pamphlets that dealt with such things as cruelty to animals in the docking of a horse's tail and a defence of a beard (his was long and white). Even when, about 1840, he painted a series of pictures devoted to the life of the horse, the works had strong moralistic overtones. Although ostensibly about horses, these paintings were actually conceived as a means of exploring man's spiritual and moral state by comparing human and animal conditions, as is evident from the descriptions in the catalogue for the exhibition at Newman Street in 1841.<br>
<br>For the next twelve years Ward continued to exhibit regularly at both the Royal Academy and the British Institution. Although he still occasionally produced a significant work, both his technical and his mental powers were on the decline. His painting became increasingly mannered and his compositions could be awkward. <span class="italic">The Council of Horses</span> (exh. RA, 1848) was one of his last major works to sell to an important collector, Robert Vernon. At the time Ward's financial situation was so bad that he had petitioned the Royal Academy the previous year for a pension of &pound;100 annually, and received the grant. He continued to paint, and two landscapes dealing with the cruelty of deer-hunting, exhibited at the academy in 1852, served as a coda to his long career. A few years later he suffered a stroke and his career was at an end. He died on 16 November 1859 at his home, Round Croft Cottage, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and was buried in Kensal Green, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>James Ward was considered by his contemporaries to be the greatest animal painter of his generation; however, his <i>&#339;uvre</i> covered a wide range of subject matter from landscape to portraiture (human as well as animal), from genre to history painting (allegorical, religious, literary, and mythological subjects), and even an occasional still life. Extraordinarily prolific, Ward produced hundreds of paintings and thousands of drawings during his long life. But his output was also extremely uneven. His greatest works were executed in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The large quantity and varying quality of his work make a balanced evaluation of him as an artist difficult. Nevertheless, he ranks among the leading artists of the British Romantic movement, particularly in his depiction of horses and in his rendering of dramatic landscapes. Examples of his work are held by many public collections, including the Tate collection, Victoria and Albert Museum, and National Portrait Gallery in London, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
