<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  Donald Forsyth</span>  (1906&#150;1973), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in London on 3 September 1906, the younger son and second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30404/', "Sir Alan Garrett Anderson (1877&#150;1952)")</script>, a partner in the family shipping firm of Anderson, Green &amp; Co., managers of the Orient Line, and of his wife, Muriel Ivy, daughter of G. W. Duncan of Richmond, Surrey. Educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Oxford, he graduated in 1928 with a third class degree in modern history and entered Anderson, Green &amp; Co., which, with the Orient Line, had become part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P. &amp; O.). He transferred to P. &amp; O. in 1934 and was appointed an assistant manager in 1936. In 1935 he married Margaret Elaine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47951/', "Sir David Richard Llewellyn, first baronet")</script>, who was a colliery chairman; they had four daughters.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in September 1939, Anderson moved to the Ministry of Shipping (subsequently the Ministry of War Transport) and joined the British merchant shipping mission to the USA in Washington, DC, in 1941. He returned to P. &amp; O. as a member of the board in 1943, becoming a managing director in 1946, deputy chairman in 1950, and chairman in succession to Sir William Currie in 1960. He retired from the P. &amp; O. board on his sixty-fifth birthday in 1971.<br>
<br>Anderson's years at P. &amp; O. saw fundamental change in the company. Before the war, the group was mainly a passenger liner concern with a large number of subsidiaries. After huge war losses, rebuilding was the most urgent task. But, looking ahead to a time when cheap long-distance air transport was likely to become available, Anderson knew that diversification was the only way to secure a future for the company. This meant new types of sea transport and different ways of handling cargo. A P. &amp; O. programme of tanker building, of which he was the principal architect, was ready to begin by 1955. This innovation was extended under his chairmanship by similar programmes for bulk carriers and carriers of oil, bulk, and ore. Further innovation included the development of closer co-operation between existing P. &amp; O. subsidiaries and the formation of new companies. As a result, the P. &amp; O. fleet spread into almost every area of shipping.<br>
<br>Anderson also played a leading role in the creation of Overseas Containers, a consortium of P. &amp; O., Ocean Steam Ship, Furness Withy, and British and Commonwealth. This established a radically new international cargo handling infrastructure beyond the financial capabilities of any one line; nor did any other shipping group develop such a wide range of marine enterprises. For this alone, Anderson deserved to be called the outstanding shipping man of his generation. His foresight and courage took the P. &amp; O. group out of the lassitude of the early 1950s into an era of renewed energy. He remained cautious, however, about expanding into land-based business: in 1972, he came out of retirement to help save P. &amp; O. from an expensive merger with Bovis, a company of property developers.<br>
<br>Elsewhere in the world of shipping, Anderson's talents were highly valued. From 1950 to 1962 he was chairman of the British Shipping Federation, president of the International Shipping Federation, and joint chairman of the National Maritime Board. He was president of the chamber of shipping (1953&#150;4), of the Institute of Shipping and Forwarding Agents (1955), and of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1956&#150;7); chairman of the British Liner Committee (1956&#150;8); president of the Institute of Export (1961&#150;3); and a member of the shipping advisory panel to the minister of transport (1962&#150;4).<br>
<br>Anderson also had non-marine business interests. He was a director of the Bank of Australasia, later Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (1936&#150;73), the National Provincial Bank, later the National Westminster Bank (1944&#150;73), and Times Newspapers (1967&#150;73). As the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30406/', "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson")</script>, he had a personal interest in the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine that she had founded in 1874. He served as its treasurer and was chairman of its council (1964&#150;73). He was also a member of the governing body of the London Graduate School of Business Studies.<br>
<br>Anderson's single-mindedness and incisive decision making were characteristics that could, at times, be disconcerting and misunderstood by those who did not share his broad view. But his achievements were formidable and his reputation internationally recognized.<br>
<br>Tall, spare, and with an air of distinction, Anderson did not seek popularity. To many people he appeared to be aloof, arrogant, and aggressive; though they respected him, they also feared him. With close friends, however, he was excellent company. Without preparation or notes, he could make a brilliant speech and never failed to entertain his audience. His London home was 105 Park Lane; Notgrove Manor near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was his country home, and he took a great interest in his farm at Moreton in Marsh. His principal leisure pursuit was hunting and he was a good horseman.<br>
<br>Anderson was knighted in 1954, and received honours from the Dutch government in 1946 and the Italian government in 1959. He was a deputy lieutenant for Gloucestershire in 1969, an honorary captain in the Royal Naval Reserve, an honorary member of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners in 1964, an elder of Trinity House in 1965, and an honorary brother of Hull Trinity House. He died of cancer in Oxford on 20 March 1973. He was survived by his wife.<br>
