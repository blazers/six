<span class="headword">Peryn,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">prior of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield, and theologian</span>, was connected with the Perins of Brockton in Shropshire, a family which itself originated in Derbyshire. He became a Dominican early in life, and was educated at Blackfriars, in Oxford, where his presence was recorded in 1529, and again in 1531, the year in which he was ordained. He then went to London, where he was a vigorous preacher against heresy. He also served as chaplain to Sir John Port. Following the declaration of the royal supremacy in 1534 he went into exile, but returned in 1543, when he supplicated for the degree of BTh at Oxford. He also became a chantrist in St Paul's. Early in 1547 he preached in favour of images. Following the accession of Edward VI, however, he is said to have recanted on 19 June 1547 in the church of St Mary Undershaft, but soon went into exile once more. After several years in Louvain he returned to England in 1553, when he was made prior of the Dominican house of St Bartholomew in Smithfield, the first of the religious houses to be founded by Queen Mary. On 8 February 1556 he preached at Paul's Cross, while Sir Thomas Sampson, priest, did public penance in a sheet and bearing a taper, for having had two wives. Henry Machyn records this and other sermons that Peryn delivered in London.<br>
<br>Peryn published three books. During the latter part of Henry VIII's reign he published a work entitled <span class="italic">Thre Godly Sermons of the Sacrament of the Aulter</span> (1546), sermons that had originally been preached in the hospital of St Anthony in London. This work is dedicated to Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, and in a preface that conceals the extent to which his material was borrowed from John Fisher's <span class="italic">De veritate corporis et sanguinis Christi in eucharistia</span> the author explains that he has compiled the sermons:<blockquote>in homely and playne sentens, by cause that I have cheflye prepared them &hellip; for the unlearned. And the veryte (beyng delectable and bewtifull of herselfe) nedeth not, the gorgius ornamentes, of eloquens. Also the matters of our fayth, hath moche lesse nede of rethoricall perswacyons, havynge theyr grond, and fundacyon, upon the infallyble veritie, of goddes holy worde. (sig. *iii<i>v</i>)</blockquote>He also published <span class="italic">Spirituall exercyses and goostly meditacions, and a neare waye to come to perfection and lyfe contemplatyve</span> (1557), which was based on the <span class="italic">Exercitia theologiae mysticae</span> of Nicolaus van Ess, and dedicated to two English nuns in exile. A book close to the heart of the Catholic martyr Margaret Clitherow, it was reprinted at Caen in 1598. There is also record of a third work, <span class="italic">De frequenter celebranda missa</span>, of which no copy survives. Peryn died in 1558, and was buried in St Bartholomew's on 22 August, at the high altar.<br>
