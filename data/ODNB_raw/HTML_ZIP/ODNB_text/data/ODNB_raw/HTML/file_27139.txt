<span class="headword">Teonge,  Henry</span>  (1621&#150;1690), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and diarist</span>, was born at Wolverton, Warwickshire, on 18 March 1621, the son of George Teonge (<i>d</i>. 1662), rector of Wolverton, and his wife, Dorothy Nicholls. He was educated at Warwick School before entering Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1639, graduating BA in 1643. He served as rector of Alcester between about 1650 and 1670, when he moved to Spernall. Financial difficulties compelled him to seek additional employment in the navy, and in May 1675 he became chaplain of the frigate <i>Assistance</i> (under Captain William Houlding), ordered to join Sir John Narbrough's fleet in the Mediterranean. He served on her until she paid off in November 1676. A period ashore in London and Spernall only encouraged Teonge's creditors, and he judiciously returned to sea in April 1678, joining Captain Anthony Langston's <i>Bristol</i> for another voyage to the Mediterranean, where he transferred to the <i>Royal Oak</i> on 16 January 1679. After his return to England in June of the same year Teonge never returned to sea, and he lived in comparative obscurity at Spernall until his death. He married first Jane, and they had three sons and a daughter; following her death in 1682, he married Penelope Hunt at Spernall on 21 October 1686. Teonge died at Spernall, where he was buried on 21 March 1690; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Teonge's posthumous fame rests solely on his diary of his two naval voyages. Full of interest in his surroundings and lively good humour, the diary is one of the most important descriptions of seagoing life in the seventeenth century. It frequently displays rather greater concern for the wardroom meals than for the spiritual well-being of the crew, together with a remarkably self-deprecating honesty on Teonge's part. On his first going to sea he admitted that all his possessions were in &#145;an old sack&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 26 May 1675) and that he was only able to obtain the essentials for his voyage by pawning his cloak and selling his horse. The social aspects of naval life proved irresistible to the impoverished, ageing chaplain, and the rituals of toasting, songs, and party games were recorded in exhaustive detail. Teonge noted with relish the officers' dinner on 29 May 1678, the king's birthday:<blockquote>an excellent salad and eggs, a fillet of veal roasted, a grand dish of mackerel, and a large lobster&#151;so hard is our fare at sea: and all washed down with good Margate ale, March beer, and, last of all, a good bowl of punch. (ibid., 29 May 1678)</blockquote>The nature of Teonge's diary, and the disappearance of the manuscript for almost a century after its first publication in 1825, led to persistent suggestions that it might have been a forgery. Confirmation both of Teonge's existence and of the sequences of events which he recorded came from the Admiralty records in the Public Record Office, and the re-emergence of the manuscript itself at a Sothebys sale in 1918 put the matter conclusively to rest.<br>
