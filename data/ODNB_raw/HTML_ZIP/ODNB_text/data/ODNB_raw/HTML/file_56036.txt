<span class="headword">Hartley,  William</span>  (1857&#150;1924), <span class="occ">showman and medicine vendor</span>, was born on 8 August 1857 at Marsh Southowram, near Halifax, Yorkshire, the son of Alfred Hartley, described as a flag facer, and his wife, Sarah Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Peel) (1832/3&#150;1910). Of his early life nothing is known. Hartley came to public notice in 1887 as the promoter of, and chief actor in, a travelling &#145;American medicine-show&#146;, which started in Portsmouth in September 1887, and which is next recorded in 1888 in Brighton and then in Dublin. His professional title was Sequah, and he was also known as William Henry Hartley.<br>
<br>The American medicine-show was an American adaptation of an older European way of selling medicines through <i>commedia dell'arte</i> shows and the telling of traveller's tales. The protagonist of the American version would entertain crowds with fictitious accounts of his travels in the Wild West, display his knowledge of secret Native American medicinal lore, draw teeth on stage with incredible speed, and effect apparently miraculous cures by rubbing the limbs of lame or rheumatic patients with supposed Indian botanic remedies. The whole performance would be heightened by brass bands, circus acts, and the presence of people supposed to be Native Americans (&#145;Redskins&#146;), dressed in full tribal war-dress, and would culminate in the sale of medicines to the public from a stage or wagon.<br>
<br>Hartley had probably had experience of such operations in America before 1887, when he formed a partnership in London with two opticians from Chicago (Alfred Danziger and Leon Kokocinski) to import the American medicine-show format unchanged into England under the name Sequah. This name was derived partly from the name of the Cherokee leader Sequoyah, and partly from a design to confuse customers of a rival American medicine troupe, the Kickapoo Indian Medicine Firm, active in the USA, which sold a medicine called Sagwa. At his crowded meetings in the great industrial cities of Britain in 1888&#150;90 Hartley, alias Sequah, met with sensational success, selling vast quantities of two main medicinal preparations&#151;Sequah's Prairie Flower, for internal use, and Sequah's Indian Oil, for external application, as well as various other branded products such as a Sequah dentifrice. The internal medicine was alleged by competitors to be made of fish oil flavoured with marjoram and alcohol, with the external one made from aloes, capsicum, and carbonate of potash.<br>
<br>In 1889 the three members turned their partnership into a small joint-stock company, Sequah Ltd, which was floated on the London stock exchange in 1890. Hartley was the managing director and the dominating figure in the company, and he was the main beneficiary of the flotation, which brought him about &pound;100,000 in cash. Hartley's enrichment from a &#145;quack medicine&#146; company may have contributed to the theme of H. G. Wells's novel <span class="italic">Tono Bungay</span> (published in 1909 but set in the 1890s). Soon after the flotation no fewer than twenty-three teams, each headed by its own Sequah, were operating simultaneously in Great Britain, with gilded wagons, German brass bands, and troops of Redskin Indians. In September 1890 the company started to expand overseas, to India, Venezuela, the West Indies, Spain, the Netherlands, and elsewhere. A Sequah was even sent to North America to compete with the original American medicine-show companies on their own ground. Hartley provided the commercial flair and the entrepreneurial spirit of the company. One of the Sequahs who worked for him at this time represents him (in a private letter) as a callous and ruthless swindler.<br>
<br>Sequah Ltd could not maintain its initial success, for several reasons. Since the beneficiaries of the flotation were the founding partners (Hartley, Danziger, and Kokocinski) rather than the company, the latter had no capital with which to finance its operations. The British government disliked the civil disturbance caused by the company's mass gatherings in market places, commons, and waste grounds, objected to the non-payment of stamp duty on its medicines, and passed an act (53 Vict. c. 8) requiring sales of medicines to take place only from a set of premises, not from a vehicle or a stage. There were objections to the company's price-fixing policy, and its many charitable donations did not pacify those who disliked its use of extreme commercial methods in an ethically sensitive market. European governments took action against Sequah's unorthodox interventions in their traditional controlled markets for pharmaceuticals, and in North America public interest in the (by then) old-fashioned routine of the American medicine-show had begun to fade. In 1895 Sequah Ltd went into liquidation. The numerous Sequahs went back to their original occupations&#151;herbalist, dentist, music-hall artist, and so on&#151;but how Hartley himself spent the rest of his life is not known; it was possibly in yacht broking. He died at his home, 7 Sherwood Street in Soho, London (later the site of the Piccadilly Theatre), on 16 January 1924, leaving &pound;734.<br>
