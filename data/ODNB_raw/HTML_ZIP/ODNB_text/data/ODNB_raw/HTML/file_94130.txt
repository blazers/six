<span class="headword">Duncan,  Patrick Baker</span>  (1918&#150;1967), <span class="occ">politician in South Africa</span>, was born on 29 June 1918 at Moot House, Park Town, Johannesburg, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32931/', "Sir Patrick Duncan (1870&#150;1943)")</script>, politician and governor-general of South Africa, and his wife, Alice Dora Amanda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dold (1893&#150;1948). At the age of eleven he developed osteomyelitis from a cricketing injury, which stiffened his right knee, causing lifelong lameness. After a year convalescing in Lausanne he went to the Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Cape Town but, unhappy there, was sent to England, to Winchester College, where his political ideas began to develop. He became a strong supporter of the emperor Haile Selassie when Ethiopia was invaded by Mussolini's troops. In 1937 he followed his father to Balliol College, Oxford, taking second-class honours in modern languages in 1940. On a summer vacation in Germany with his mother's relations he spent three weeks in a <i>Reichsarbeitsdienst</i> youth camp and &#145;smelt for the first time the evil stench of totalitarianism&#146;  (Borth. Inst., CSAS DU 9-1, ch. 2, fol. 54).<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war, unfit for military service due to his lameness, Duncan entered the colonial service and was posted to the then crown colony of Basutoland in 1941. His career, first as a district officer, was orthodox enough, though he supported and found a pension for the pioneer African novelist, author of <span class="italic">Chaka</span>, Thomas Mofolo, who had lost his farm and livelihood under the <span class="roman">South African Land Act</span> in 1913, and he challenged the Anglican church for paying its black and white clergy unequally. He also developed an intense concern for soil conservation ahead of his time. He spent 1945&#150;7 as private secretary to the British high commissioner in southern Africa, Sir Evelyn Baring, returning to Basutoland in 1947 with his wife, whom he had married in Cape Town a few months before, on 25 April 1947. She was Cynthia, daughter of Sir Patrick Ashley Cooper, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and a director of the Bank of England. Their marriage was a happy one and she was a great support to him. Two sons and two daughters were born between 1948 and 1959.<br>
<br>In 1949 Duncan spent two terms on a &#145;refresher&#146; at the London School of Economics, taught by Harold Laski. He emerged as irrevocably opposed to communism as he was to apartheid and all forms of racism, intensified by the advent to power of the Afrikaner Nationalists in South Africa the previous year. His last post in Basutoland (1950&#150;52) was as judicial commissioner, with Chief Leabua Jonathan, later prime minister of independent Lesotho, as his principal assessor. Speaking excellent Sesotho, Duncan was able to set down and publish <span class="italic">Sotho Law and Customs</span> (1960). It was a commitment to Gandhism that led Duncan, after resignation from the colonial service, to take part in the defiance campaign led by the young Nelson Mandela in 1952. With Manilal Gandhi, son of the Mahatma, he marched forty &#145;defiers&#146; of all races into Germiston &#145;native location&#146; near Johannesburg without a permit, and was briefly gaoled. The flagging campaign sprang into the world's headlines, and won a new recognition of the growing evils of white supremacist rule in South Africa.<br>
<br>The years that followed took Duncan from national organizer of the non-racial Liberal Party of South Africa, where he clashed with its leader Alan Paton (though they remained friends), to the editorship of <span class="italic">Contact</span>, a fortnightly news magazine based in Cape Town, and published from 1958, which supported the Liberals and took on the strong communist element in the African National Congress and its allies. He came nearest to the centrality he had achieved in the defiance campaign after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960 and the subsequent state of emergency. After acting as intermediary between the police and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) leaders of the march of 40,000 followers from Langa location into central Cape Town in March 1960, he defied the emergency regulations. <span class="italic">Contact</span> was alone in the South African media in fully reporting the PAC campaign and its aftermath, a turning point in South Africa's long road to democracy. Duncan was heavily fined and later gaoled for refusing to name a source of information about underground political activity; his trial speech was published in <span class="italic">The Law as Literature</span> (ed. L. Blom-Cooper, 1961). Though its wings were clipped financially, <span class="italic">Contact</span> continued to have an influence far beyond South Africa, as it reported the rapid progress of neighbouring colonies to independence, or, as in Namibia, Zimbabwe, and the then Portuguese colonies, their liberation campaigns.<br>
<br>In 1961 Duncan was reconciled with Nelson Mandela, who sought <span class="italic">Contact</span>'s support for the national strike he called. Duncan's activities against separate development plans in the Transkei probably led to his banning order in 1961 under, paradoxically, the <span class="roman">Suppression of Communism Act</span>. He escaped to the Lesotho mountains, from where he joined the PAC, by then committed to the armed struggle. The PAC made him their north African representative, based in Algiers, but its new leaders opposed his views and expelled him. A post with a major relief organization, the Comit&eacute; Chr&eacute;tien de Service en Alg&eacute;rie, sustained him in Algeria, but aplastic anaemia was diagnosed and after intermittent and lengthy treatment, he died in Westminster Hospital, London, on 4 June 1967.<br>
<br>Duncan had immense charm and an informality and good humour which won him a host of friends of all races. Steadfast, yet sometimes impulsive, he &#145;dared to be a Daniel&#146; and became a potent symbol of non-communist witness for non-racial democracy in South Africa. He maintained many interests outside his political life and spent the months of his illness writing his posthumously published <span class="italic">Man and the Earth</span> (1975), full of ideas on saving the planet, which were, like so much of his thought, decades ahead of others.<br>
