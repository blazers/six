<span class="headword">Pryme,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1868), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at Cottingham, Yorkshire, on 4 April 1781, the only surviving child (an elder brother had died in infancy) of Christopher Pryme, merchant of Hull, and Alice, daughter of George Dinsdale of Nappa Hall, Wensleydale. He was a descendant of Peter, the younger brother of Abraham Pryme, an antiquary. After his father's early death, George Pryme and his mother moved to Nottinghamshire, where he attended several private schools. In 1796 he went to Hull grammar school, where the headmaster was the Revd Joseph Milner, and he was later tutored by John Dawson.<br>
<br>In October 1799 Pryme entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship in the following year; he became sixth wrangler and graduated BA in 1803. Before 1805, when he was elected a fellow of his college, he won no fewer than five prizes for Latin, Greek, and English, and earned himself the nickname of Prize Pryme. Having already begun studying law in Lincoln's Inn in October 1804, he was called to the bar in 1806. He practised in London until his health broke down, and on medical advice he returned two years later to Cambridge, where he won a prize in 1809 for an English poem. He then worked as a provincial barrister, being dubbed Counsellor Pryme. On 30 August 1813 he married Jane Townley (1788&#150;1871), daughter of Thomas Thackeray (1736&#150;1806), a Cambridge surgeon. A son and a daughter were born to them.<br>
<br>In 1816 Pryme began to lecture on political economy in Cambridge, the first lectures specifically on that subject to be delivered in any British university. Requiring from his audience no prior knowledge, these were elementary and eclectic, a popularization&#151;in the best sense&#151;of a subject that could then be mastered only with great perseverance. Although he gained the vice-chancellor's permission, the college heads, suspicious of such innovations, would not allow his lectures to begin before midday, so as not to interfere with college teaching. That year he turned his lectures into a book, <span class="italic">Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Political Economy</span>, which reached its fourth (revised) edition in 1859. The courses were well attended, and in 1828 the senate granted him the title of professor.<br>
<br>Unusually for a don, Pryme involved himself in town affairs. He was appointed a paving commissioner and, as a reforming whig, in the 1820s he opposed the parliamentary candidates sponsored by the duke of Rutland. After the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> was passed, the duke's nominees faded away, and Pryme stood for Cambridge in the general election of 1832 as a whig and headed the poll. In the House of Commons his speeches were heard with respect and attention, and he was soon a member of several committees. Later he was entrusted with steering through minor but useful bills, for example, one that enabled a sect called separatists to affirm. In 1836 he took an active part in the discussion of the <span class="roman">Tithe Commutation Act</span>. He favoured shorter parliaments and the admission of dissenters to Oxford and Cambridge universities.<br>
<br>Pryme's efforts to become a university reformer were not all that successful. In 1834 he spoke in favour of a petition to the house for abolishing subscription on graduation, and three years later (on 4 May 1837) introduced a motion to appoint a commission of inquiry into the state of Oxford and Cambridge universities. The chancellor of the exchequer, Thomas Spring-Rice, stymied him with the reply that that was a matter for the crown, and university reform languished for another decade and a half. Characteristically, he very seldom left the house until it rose, and he voted in practically every division of importance. He so ran down his health that his family compelled him to retire from parliament in 1841.<br>
<br>Back in Cambridge, Pryme continued to deliver his lectures and practised from time to time as a barrister. He became interested in the Norfolk estuary scheme and other local improvements. In 1847 he and his family moved to Wistow in Huntingdonshire, where he had bought a 500 acre estate; having absorbed the elements of chemistry, he applied them to the cultivation of his land, which made a profit in most years, except just after the repeal of the corn laws, a measure which he supported. He gave up his Cambridge lectures in 1863, when the senate voted to continue his chair. He died in Wistow on 2 December 1868 and was buried there a week later.<br>
<br>Pryme crammed a great amount into his long life, but the range of his interests denied him the chance of becoming as celebrated as his abilities warranted. An early riser, he never wasted a moment of the day. When not writing at his desk, he was reading; he often held a book in his hand while driving himself in his open carriage. He helped to nourish his retentive memory by meditating on a book for some time after closing it. He bequeathed his books and pamphlets on political economy to the University of Cambridge.<br>
