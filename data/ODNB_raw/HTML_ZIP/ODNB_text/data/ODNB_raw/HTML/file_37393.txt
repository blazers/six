<span class="headword">Elliot, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1814&#150;1893), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born in Gateshead on 18 March 1814, the son of Ralph Elliot, pitman, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Braithwaite, of Newcastle upon Tyne. He began work as a pit boy in 1823 at the Pensher colliery owned by Charles Stewart, third marquess of Londonderry, and was a union leader there during the strike in 1831 over the length of the working day. Elliot later recalled that it was the most violent dispute that had taken place in the coal industry, &#145;for it caused bloodshed and death, and men were hung in chains on the Tyneside for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Gallery of Celebrities</span>, 2).<br>
<br>At the age of seventeen Elliot was apprenticed to Thomas Sopwith, a local land surveyor and mining engineer, and was involved with the latter's investigation of coal resources in the Forest of Dean. Elliot also helped to survey the line of the proposed railway between Darlington and York. Returning to Pensher in 1837 as overman, Elliot became under-manager (1841) and then manager (1844) at Monkwearmouth pit, the deepest in Britain. In the mid-1840s he became a managing partner in Washington colliery, and then opened the Unsworth mine on his own account. Elliot was appointed Lord Londonderry's coal viewer in 1848, and two years later bought from him the Pensher colliery where he had worked as a boy.<br>
<br>During the next two decades Elliot became one of the most important industrialists in Britain. In the 1860s he acquired further mines in north Wales, north and south Staffordshire, and in Nova Scotia. One of his most significant investments was in the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company in south Wales, where he was general manager as well as the largest shareholder. Elliot's purchase of the wire-rope-making business of Kuper &amp; Co. in 1849 was also noteworthy. He amalgamated it with the Gutta Percha Company to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, and it was this concern that laid the first permanent transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866.<br>
<br>Elliot was one of a new type of mining engineer, whose expertise extended to many parts of the industry. He helped to found the Institute of Mining Engineers in 1852, and was a member of its council (1852&#150;7), vice-president (1865&#150;8), and president (1868&#150;9). He was in the forefront of experiments in mining technology, and an advocate of improved safety lamps, shaft detaching hooks, and coal-cutting machinery. Trials at his collieries of new ventilating methods, such as the fan and high-pressure steam jets, were widely discussed, and he made a major contribution to the most efficient method of mining coal simultaneously in adjacent seams. He argued that economy, efficiency, and safety were compatible and, unlike many of his colleagues, supported the establishment of the mines inspectorate in the 1850s.<br>
<br>His attitude to labour changed from that of an early nineteenth-century tory paternalist, advocating model villages provided by employers and condemning trade unions, to that of a post-Disraelian Conservative, who believed in self-help and free collective bargaining. First elected to parliament on 26 November 1868, Elliot represented the mining constituency of North Durham for a number of years: he was its MP from November 1868 to January 1874, from June 1874 to March 1880, and again from September 1881 to November 1885. He failed to be elected in February 1874 and April 1880, and was also unsuccessful at South-east Durham in December 1885, but he was MP for Monmouth from July 1886 to July 1892. His achievements were suitably recognized in 1874 when a baronetcy was bestowed on him, the first such award to a coal-industry figure. Elliot was a prominent freemason, and held high office in the movement in south Wales.<br>
<br>In his parliamentary work Elliot was mostly concerned with matters affecting the coal industry and the City, though he was also an early advocate of &#145;gas and water socialism&#146;. He appeared as an expert witness before several government inquiries, and served on the royal commission on the coal industry (28 June 1866 to 27 July 1871). Shortly before his death he made an unsuccessful attempt to solve the coal industry's economic and labour difficulties by proposing the amalgamation of collieries into a massive semi-public enterprise monitored by the Board of Trade, which would control output, fix prices, pay fair wages, and establish a miners' welfare fund. Although the response was lukewarm, <span class="italic">The Times</span> considered that it was one of the most interesting industrial schemes of the decade (20 Sept 1893).<br>
<br>Elliot was a popular figure in the north-east of England. His Durham mining constituents warmly referred to him as &#145;Bonnie Geordie&#146;, and he never lost the unpolished manner of his lowly origins. He married Margaret Green of Rainton, Durham, in 1836, and they had two sons and four daughters. Elliot's wife died in 1880, and he never remarried, but he was involved in a well-publicized breach of promise case ten years later. He was sued by Emily Mary Hairs, a professional singer, for &pound;5000 damages, but her claim was rejected by a jury on 18 April 1890. Elliot owned substantial estates in Monmouthshire and at Whitby, but he died at his house, 17 Portland Place, London, on 23 December 1893. His second son, George William Elliot, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
