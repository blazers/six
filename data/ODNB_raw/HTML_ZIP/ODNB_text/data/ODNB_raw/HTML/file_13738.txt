<span class="headword">Hope,  Thomas Charles</span>  (1766&#150;1844), <span class="occ">chemist and educationist</span>, was born on 21 July 1766 in Edinburgh, the third of four sons and a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13730/', "John Hope (1725&#150;1786)")</script>, professor of botany at the University of Edinburgh, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of a Dr Stevenson, an Edinburgh physician. Educated mainly at the high school, Edinburgh, in 1779 he entered the university where he gave much attention to botany and chemistry. On his father's death he applied unsuccessfully for his chair. The following year, 1787, he graduated MD at Edinburgh, and through the influence of his uncle, Alexander Stevenson, professor of medicine in the University of Glasgow, was elected lecturer in chemistry and materia medica at Glasgow. In 1788 he ceased to teach materia medica and lectured on chemistry alone until 1791. Although previously a believer in the phlogiston theory, in 1788 he became the first in Britain to teach the alternative views of Lavoisier, to whose opinions he was converted by Sir James Hall (1761&#150;1832).<br>
<br>In 1789 his uncle secured for Hope appointments as his assistant and successor. On Stevenson's death in 1791 Hope assumed the chair of medicine which he held until October 1795. He was physician and clinical lecturer to the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, opened in 1794, but continued to conduct private research in chemistry. In 1793 he communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which he had become a fellow in 1788, his paper on the first known compound of strontium. Joseph Black, professor of chemistry and medicine at Edinburgh, was so impressed by this discovery of a new chemical element that he secured for Hope, his former pupil, the post of assistant professor from November 1795. In 1797&#150;8 Hope took over all Black's lectures and succeeded him in 1799.<br>
<br>As professor at Edinburgh, Hope did not neglect medicine. For several years he lectured on clinical medicine and, having been elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, in 1796, was its secretary (1798&#150;1803), treasurer (1803&#150;9), and president (1815&#150;19). He wrote the chemical part of the tenth edition of its <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span> (1817). In 1810 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London. As a chemist, he was initially innovative in teaching and research. He continued to promote the new chemistry of Lavoisier, and for several years he was the only Scottish professor who advocated the geological views of James Hutton. In 1805 he published his discovery that the maximum density of water occurs not at the freezing point, 32 &deg;F, but around 39 &deg;F. He was also active as a consultant. In 1806 Thomas Thomson, Andrew Coventry, and he reported to the Scottish excise commissioners the results of two years' work on the differences between English and Scottish barley. In 1813 he investigated the water supply of Edinburgh so thoroughly that in 1817 he was given the freedom of the city.<br>
<br>However, after 1806, Hope devoted his talents mainly to improving his teaching. He had the advantage of succeeding the illustrious Black whose impeccably neat lecture demonstrations had attracted an audience of about 200. Receiving no salary, dependent on the fees paid by members of his class, and having to meet its costs, Hope sustained a testing programme: for six months for five days a week he gave spectacular and punctiliously organized lecture-demonstrations using large apparatus specially designed for the purpose. Spurning the rewards of writing textbooks, Hope reached his peak in the 1820s: his clear if pompous lectures, given from 1820 in his big room in the new Adam&#150;Playfair building, attracted an audience of over 500 and fees of about &pound;2000 per annum from his exceptionally heterogeneous class, which was open to any man who could pay. Numerous foreigners, from princes to ancient historians, were impressed by his chemical drama. In spring 1826 he reached the zenith of his popularity when he gave a course to which women and their beaux were admitted; the fees from the audience of over 600 enabled him in 1828 to give &pound;800 to found a university chemistry prize. In 1826 Hope was a conspicuous protagonist in the professorial quarrelling which was endemic at Edinburgh. Publicly reviled by one colleague as a mere showman, he himself had to pay &pound;500 to another for defamation. In 1823 he became a vice-president of the RSE.<br>
<br>Until 1823 Hope provided no opportunities for students to do practical work. He then grudgingly arranged for his own lecture assistant, John Wilson Anderson, to run a practical class at his own responsibility and risk. By the early 1830s Hope was under threat. In 1833 David Boswell Reid (1805&#150;1863), then in charge of the practical class, lobbied Edinburgh town council, which supervised the university, to create a separate chair of practical chemistry. This proposal was successfully opposed by the university senate and by Hope who vigorously defended his professorial monopoly. By this point, indifferent to research, to practical chemistry, and to contact with industry, he resisted any addition to the lecturing which had brought him esteem and wealth for three decades. Next year the town council seriously considered but rejected the establishment of a separate lectureship in practical chemistry.<br>
<br>Hope maintained his control of practical chemistry at the cost of publicly displayed ill will, the discrediting of the university's course of practical chemistry, and a severe drop in the size of his class and income from 1833. He continued to teach until summer 1843 when he resigned his chair; his last class numbered only 118. A wealthy bachelor, he remained a leading figure in Edinburgh's polite society, and was reputed to be capable of eating eight plates of turtle. He lived in Moray Place, a select part of Edinburgh's New Town, enjoyed his vice-presidency of the Edinburgh Royal Society, and in 1837 presided by invitation over the centenary dinner of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh. After a long illness Hope died of paralysis on 13 June 1844 at his home. He was buried at Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, on 18 June.<br>
