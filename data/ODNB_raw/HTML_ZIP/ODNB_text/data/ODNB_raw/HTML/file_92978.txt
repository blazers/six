<span class="headword">Sturmy, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1356&#150;1427), <span class="occ">diplomat and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son of Geoffrey Sturmy, a younger son of an important Wiltshire family, and an unidentified mother. William came to prominence in 1381 when his uncle, Sir Henry Sturmy, died childless and he inherited extensive property in Hampshire, Devon, and Wiltshire. The bulk of his estates, including his seat at Wolf Hall in Great Bedwyn, were in Wiltshire and in 1412 these were assessed as being worth &pound;91 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. annually. Shortly after coming into his inheritance he married Joan Crawthorne (<i>d</i>. 1429), the widow of the Devon landowner Sir John Beaumont, who brought him estates worth &pound;40 per annum, and in April 1384 he was elected as one of the knights of the shire for Hampshire, the first of twelve such returns to the Commons.<br>
<br>Already at this stage in his career it seems probable that Sturmy had connections at the court of Richard II. From the mid-1380s he was appointed to politically sensitive commissions in Wiltshire, Hampshire, Devon, Surrey, and Berkshire and his election to four successive parliaments between January 1390 and 1393 for three different counties indicate the breadth of his interests and his usefulness as a crown servant. Some measure of his standing can be gained by the fact that in 1392 he successfully brought a charge of maintenance against Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, before the king's council. This may represent an attempt to challenge the regional hegemony of the Courtenays&#151;at the Winchester parliament of the following year Sturmy was appointed to a commission to investigate the unlawful activities of the earl's uncle, Sir Philip Courtenay of Powderham. In October 1392 he was retained by Richard as a knight of the household with an annuity of &pound;40 and was probably a frequent attender at the royal court. In 1394 he accompanied the king to Ireland and in 1397&#150;8 he undertook his first diplomatic mission, to the courts of the rival popes at Avignon and Rome, in an attempt to end the schism in the church. He also developed close connections to William Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, and one of his daughters married a kinsman of the bishop.<br>
<br>Despite Sturmy's close association with Richard he suffered no loss of influence on the latter's deposition. He sat for Wiltshire in the parliament of 1399, which legitimated Richard's deposition, and by March 1401 his annuity had been confirmed and he had become a member of Henry IV's council. For the next sixteen months he was employed on diplomatic missions, mainly in the empire. These resulted in the marriage of Henry's daughter Blanche to Ludwig, the heir presumptive to the king of the Romans, and in the months before the marriage Sturmy served as steward of her household. On his return to England he served with the king against the Welsh rebels, then, when a parliament was summoned to Coventry in October 1404, he was chosen as speaker of the House of Commons. His appointment was probably due to his diplomatic experience in Germany. At the end of the session, which lasted little more than a month, Sturmy was authorized by parliament to treat with the grand master of the Teutonic order for the removal of the embargo placed on imports of English cloth, and in 1405, and again in 1407, he made lengthy visits to the Baltic. When he made his final report before the Gloucester parliament of autumn 1407 he was owed diplomatic wages of over &pound;100. Probably in 1404 Sturmy had received another important office, that of chief steward of the dower lands of Queen Joan of Navarre, a position that increased his regional power by allowing him to take out leases on some of her estates at favourable rates. The influence that the stewardship gave him in Wiltshire is evident from the large number of his associates and servants who were returned to parliament for the Wiltshire boroughs of Great Bedwyn and Marlborough in these years. In November 1419 he was pricked for the first and only time as sheriff of Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Sturmy continued to act as steward after Henry IV's death and survived Queen Joan's disgrace in 1419 for allegedly plotting Henry V's death by necromancy. He was elected to the parliaments of May 1413, November 1414, and November 1417 as knight of the shire for Wiltshire. Sturmy's annuity, too, was renewed by the new king, and further diplomatic missions followed, notably in 1418 when he was one of the negotiators for the proposed marriage of John, duke of Bedford, to Jacqueline of Hainault. His influence with Henry V was probably not as great as he had previously enjoyed, however, and in 1417 Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, as warden of the royal forests south of the Trent, dispossessed him of his family's hereditary wardenship of Savernake Forest in Wiltshire. It took three years of hard bargaining before Gloucester was compelled to reinstate him. In 1422 Sturmy was elected to his last parliament (to which he also secured the election for Wiltshire boroughs of his illegitimate son, his grandson, and a cousin). Sturmy was already in his sixties, and this first parliament of Henry VI was the last act of his public career. Although he continued to serve as a justice of the peace for his native county until 1425 he did not serve on any more <i>ad hoc</i> commissions.<br>
<br>Sturmy made his will in London on 19 March 1427. He asked to be buried at the Trinitarian priory of Easton Royal near Wolf Hall and he made small bequests to Salisbury Cathedral and to repair the bells at Elvetham church in Hampshire. He left a small library, including two volumes of Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, and made personal bequests, mainly of arms and plate, to Sir Robert Shotesbrooke and his wife's son-in-law, Sir Hugh Luttrell. Sturmy died at Elvetham at about eight o'clock in the evening of 21 March. His heirs were his daughter Agnes, and his grandson John Seymour, the son of his daughter Maud. After his death the family quarrelled over possession of the manors of Crofton and Wolf Hall. The dispute revolved around a deathbed enfeoffment he was supposed to have made and an alleged fraud by his illegitimate son, John. The dispute dragged on into the 1450s, but the final outcome is not clear.<br>
