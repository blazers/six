<span class="headword">Landor,  (Arnold) Henry Savage</span>  (1867&#150;1924), <span class="occ">explorer and artist</span>, was born on 2 June 1867 in Florence, Italy, the second of the three sons (there was also a daughter) of Charles Savage Landor (1825&#150;1917) and his wife, Esmeralda Armida Piselli. His grandfather was the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15980/', "Walter Savage Landor (1775&#150;1864)")</script>. He was educated at the Liceo Dante and the Istituto Tecnico, Florence, and studied portrait painting in Paris, which he abandoned in 1888 to travel round the world. He supported himself by painting the portraits of the distinguished people he met on the way, and in Japan he went off alone to live among the aboriginal Ainu. His books <span class="italic">Alone with the Hairy Ainu</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">Corea, or, Cho-sen, the Land of the Morning Calm</span> (1895) were well received and in 1896 he undertook a scientific expedition to Tibet, where he was captured and tortured. The book about his experiences, <span class="italic">In the Forbidden Land</span> (1898), was translated into all the major European languages, though his scientific data were seen to be of less importance.<br>
<br>In 1899 Landor climbed Mount Lumpa in Nepal and in 1900 he joined the allied march on Peking (Beijing) during the Boxer uprising. He undertook further expeditions between 1903 and 1911 over little-explored territory. He traversed the deserts of Persia and Baluchistan by camel, crossed central Africa at its widest point (which he later described in <span class="italic">Across Wildest Africa</span>, 1907), and explored the Mato Grosso of Brazil, where his men mutinied and made two attempts on his life. The party found its way back to civilization in a starving condition on an improvised raft. These experiences he recorded in <span class="italic">Across Unknown South America</span> (1913). In the Philippines he visited headhunters in Luzon and discovered the white-skinned Mansaka people in Mindanao (described in <span class="italic">The Gems of the East</span>, 1904). During the First World War he toured the western front and submitted designs for improved armoured cars, motorcycles, and airships, and a device for destroying barbed-wire entanglements. He had experimented with flying machines as early as 1893.<br>
<br>Landor's want of training and his impatience to press on with all speed made him an unreliable surveyor, and there were those who impugned the veracity of his hair-raising escapes; but in energy and resourcefulness, and in courage and power of endurance, he was the equal of any of the previous generation of great explorers. He scorned special equipment and was said to have appeared on a mountain or in a jungle as he would in Bond Street. His contempt for ropes and nailed boots nearly cost him his life on several occasions while mountaineering. As a painter he had the facility to produce a likeness in a single one-hour sitting, and the numerous illustrations he made for his books are competent. A bronze bust he did of his father shows real ability.<br>
<br>Landor was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1892, and a member of the Royal Institution in 1897. He died, unmarried, at his home at via Farina 10 in Florence on 26 December 1924 after being knocked down by a motor vehicle in London.<br>
