<span class="headword">Ashby,  David  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1260&#150;1275), <span class="occ">Dominican friar</span>, is of uncertain origins. His Englishness is well attested, but the suggestion that he was related to a namesake who held Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, in 1242&#150;3, though plausible, cannot be substantiated. Having joined the Dominican order, he was at Acre by January 1260, when the Mongols invaded northern Syria and took Aleppo. Tommaso Agni di Lentino, bishop of Bethlehem and papal legate to the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, sent Ashby on a mission to their commander, H&uuml;leg&uuml;, the founder of the Mongol power in Iran and Iraq (the ilkhanate). When H&uuml;leg&uuml; withdrew to Azerbaijan with the bulk of his forces in March, Ashby must have accompanied him, since envoys from H&uuml;leg&uuml;'s son and successor, the ilkhan Abagha, to the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, who arrived under Ashby's escort, alleged that he had spent many years in ilkhanid territory and witnessed several Mongol campaigns. But he is known in 1271 to have brought the Lord Edward, then on crusade in the Holy Land, news of the condition of his uncle, Richard of Cornwall, and other family business. He is also described at Lyons as currently the ambassador of both Agni (by now patriarch of Jerusalem) and Hugues III, king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and in 1275 Edward referred to him as the patriarch's <i>capellanus et familiaris</i>. In all probability, therefore, Ashby had rejoined Agni before 1271, and was attached to the Mongol embassy as it passed through Palestine <i>en route</i> for the West.<br>
<br>Abagha hoped to gain western European co-operation against the Muslim mameluke sultanate of Egypt, and the public baptism of at least one of his ambassadors at the council caused a sensation in western Europe. In their report the envoys called on Ashby to witness that following his victories H&uuml;leg&uuml; had ordered the liberation of Christians who had been enslaved by the Muslims, and had returned the Holy Land to Christian rule, presumably during the brief Mongol occupation in 1260. They also claimed that H&uuml;leg&uuml; had opened his heart to Ashby concerning his sympathy for the Christian faith. This last assertion may reflect misapprehensions about the Mongols' eclectic and pluralistic approach to religious matters, but much of the rest is highly tendentious and seems to have represented an attempt to convince the West that the ilkhan was a trustworthy ally.<br>
<br>Ashby himself produced a treatise on the Mongols, entitled <span class="italic">Les fais des Tartares</span>; the only known text, contained in a manuscript in the royal library at Turin, was destroyed by fire in 1904. A description of the manuscript, published in 1867 and including a transcription of one chapter, shows that the text comprised in all twenty-five chapters, occupied eight folios in double columns, and was accompanied by fine miniatures. The fact that the language clearly approximated more closely to the <i>langue d'oc</i> than to Anglo-French is not necessarily problematic: the text in the Turin manuscript may have represented a translation from Ashby's original Latin version. The rubrics of the chapters are concerned with the Mongols' lifestyle, their livestock, their judicial processes, their tents and method of striking camp, and their reception of visitors. A number of the chapters are devoted, predictably, to military matters: how they fought, how they besieged fortified places, how they captured Aleppo, and how they entered Egypt (a reference, presumably, to their advance as far as Gaza in the early months of 1260). For all the excitement occasioned by the Mongol embassy's appearance at the council, Ashby's long sojourn in the ilkhanate had clearly not fostered any illusions about the Mongols' aims. At the beginning of <span class="italic">Les fais</span> he refers to &#145;ceste malite gent&#146; and stresses their ideology of world domination; and he concludes with a prayer that the Lord will bring peace to the Christians, an allusion, no doubt, to the further damage that the Mongols might inflict on a disunited Christendom.<br>
<br>After the council ended in mid-July 1274, Ashby went on to England, where he presented a letter from Abagha to Edward I, which again expressed sympathy for Christianity, apologized for the ilkhan's failure to co-ordinate military operations with Edward's crusade in 1271&#150;2, and proposed a joint attack on Egypt. But in his reply, dated 26 January 1275, Edward was non-committal about the prospects for collaboration, though he undertook to inform Abagha if circumstances became more favourable. Nothing further is recorded of Ashby, who presumably returned to the East bearing the king's letter to the ilkhan.<br>
