<span class="headword">Conn,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the son of Patrick Conn of Auchry, near Turriff, Aberdeenshire, and Isabella Chyn of Esselmont. He was raised as a Catholic and educated at Douai, the Scots College at Paris, and in Rome before entering the University of Bologna. He served as tutor to the son of the duke of Mirandola before joining the household of Cardinal Montalto in Rome in the summer of 1623. Montalto left him a substantial legacy six months later. Conn then entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, nephew to Urban VIII, accompanying him on diplomatic missions to France and Spain. He joined the Franciscan order and became a canon of St Lawrence in Damaso and secretary to the congregation of rites.<br>
<br>In 1624 Conn published <span class="italic">Vita Mariae Stuartae Scotiae reginae</span>, which he dedicated to the pope. This hagiographic biography became the main source for Lope de Vega's <span class="italic">Corona tragica</span> (Madrid, 1627) and also inspired Giovanni Battista Ciampoli's <span class="italic">Poesia in lode dell'inchiostro dedicata al Signior Georgio Coneo</span> (Rome, 1626). Encouraged by his success Conn published <span class="italic">De duplici religionis apud Scotos</span> with the Vatican Press in 1628. The first book of this work traced the history of Christianity in Scotland from the Roman period down to the beginnings of the Reformation, while the second narrated the contest between Scottish Catholicism and heresy from the 1540s until the early seventeenth century. It closed with a flattering reference to the book's dedicatee, Cardinal Barberini, as a patron and protector of Scottish Catholics.<br>
<br>In 1633 Queen Henrietta Maria nominated Conn to the College of Cardinals in a letter to Barberini transmitted by Sir Robert Douglas. Charles I knew about and tacitly supported the proposal as a means of reopening communications with the Vatican. Barberini foresaw difficulties with the nomination and it was decided to defer action while dispatching an agent to England to assess the situation there, including the prospects that Charles himself might convert. Gregorio Panzani, who was chosen for this assignment, sent back encouraging reports of the desires of the king and other leading figures at the English court for reunion with Rome. The Vatican decided to send a more senior representative and in late spring 1636 selected Conn, largely thanks to active lobbying by Henrietta Maria's favourite, Wat Montagu, who was visiting Rome at the time after converting to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Conn arrived in England on 17 July 1636. Like Panzani he was accredited to the queen rather than the king, to whom he presented himself on 24 July. But he was also immediately welcomed by other leading personalities of the court, including the protestant earls of Pembroke and Holland. He quickly established a close relationship with the king, whom he often encountered in the queen's apartments. Charles confided in Conn his belief that the French were trying to use his wife to serve their own interests, quizzed him about Catholic doctrines, and engaged him in genial arguments over points of theology.<br>
<br>The intimacy between the king and the papal agent aroused jealousies but also enhanced Conn's influence with both protestant and Catholic courtiers. Conn adroitly used his position not only to probe English attitudes and lobby for concessions but to build a Catholic party. He soon became less sanguine than Panzani over the immediate prospects for reunification, since he realized that Charles and Archbishop William Laud would demand concessions that the Vatican was unwilling to grant. He therefore concentrated on softening enforcement of the penal laws and negotiating changes in the wording of the oath of allegiance to make it less objectionable to Catholics. He was largely successful in the first goal and obtained substantial concessions with respect to the oath, although these failed to satisfy the Vatican. Meanwhile he attempted to discover the religious attitudes of English bishops and leading members of the court and to persuade any who seemed well disposed to Rome to convert.<br>
<br>Panzani had commented before Conn's arrival that a successful papal agent to the English court must be especially adept at working through women, and this proved prophetic. Although Conn was assisted in his proselytizing by the queen's confessor, Father Philip of Sanquhar, and the indefatigable Montagu, whose return to royal favour he helped arrange, his most effective allies were the queen and the countess of Arundel. In 1637&#150;8 several other prominent women at court converted and joined his campaign, among them Olivia Porter, the wife of Charles's pro-Spanish bedchamber servant Endymion Porter, and the formerly puritan Lady Newport. These &#145;Amazons who &hellip; day and night employ their uttermost endeavours for the dignity of the apostolic see&#146;, as Barberini appreciatively described them  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 5.121), were further reinforced in 1639 by the arrival of the pro-Spanish French duchess of Chevreuse and the queen's mother, Marie de' Medici. The growth of Catholicism at court caused considerable scandal, as did the increasingly ostentatious worship by English subjects at chapels maintained by the queen and the ambassadors of Catholic states, and in Conn's own Long Acre house, where eight masses were celebrated daily.<br>
<br>Conn regarded the crisis provoked by the new Scottish prayer book of 1637 as an opportunity to make Charles reliant on Catholic support against puritan opponents. He took every opportunity to contrast Catholic loyalty with puritan disobedience, urged the king to lift restrictions on Catholics owning arms so they would be in a better position to defend him, and hinted that the pope's friendship might restrain France and Spain from trying to profit from Britain's internal problems. He helped to organize the collection of a voluntary &#145;contribution&#146; by Catholics to aid the king in the first bishops' war and encouraged Scottish Catholic nobles at the English court to organize military resistance to the covenanters. He became involved as well in discussions of a possible loan from the pope and military assistance from Spain.<br>
<br>These efforts provoked a fierce reaction. Rumours circulated that Conn had brought the new Scottish prayer book from Rome and that he was hearing the confessions of the king. He was also the victim of internal rancour within the English Catholic community. Moderate Catholics with unrealistic expectations of the concessions Rome would offer to achieve reunification with England blamed him for taking a rigid stance. Many secular priests regarded him as an ally of the Jesuits. Damaging leaks of information and false accusations from disgruntled Catholics further inflamed English opinion. Conn's failure to win the coveted promotion to the cardinalate also undermined his prestige within the British Catholic community and with the king.<br>
<br>By spring 1639 Conn's health was failing and his doctors concluded that he would not survive another winter in England. Barberini therefore reluctantly recalled him to Rome. Conn left England in late summer, shortly after the arrival of his successor, Rossetti, with renewed hope that he would shortly be made a cardinal, but he died on 10 January 1640 without the coveted prize; he was buried in Rome and a monument to him was erected in the church of St Lawrence, Damaso. Henrietta Maria and her allies continued his efforts to build a Catholic party at Whitehall and exploit the Scots crisis to win religious concessions from Charles. Conn played a significant, if indirect, role in creating the climate of religious polarization and fierce suspicion of popery at court that made civil war possible.<br>
