<span class="headword">Jones,  Enid  Wyn</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Enid Williams]</span>  (1909&#150;1967), <span class="occ">religious and social worker</span>, was born in Wrexham, Denbighshire, on 17 January 1909, the only daughter of Dr David Llewelyn Williams (1870&#150;1947), medical officer of health for Wrexham, and his wife, Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Price) of Rhyl. Her brothers Eric and Alun became respectively a general medical practitioner and an adult educationist. The family moved to Cardiff in 1912, but she spent the war years in Rhyl; her father was with the Royal Army Medical Corps in France. At the end of the war the family was reunited at 33 Ninian Road, Cardiff, and in 1920 her father (who assumed the surname Llewelyn-Williams) became chief medical officer of health for Wales.<br>
<br>Enid Williams was educated between 1919 and 1926 at the Welsh Girls' School, Ashford, Middlesex, during the last years of the formidable headmistress Anne Hildred Jones, who was at the helm from 1889 to 1929. From there she proceeded to the Domestic Science College in Cardiff (1926&#150;7) and then she trained as a nurse at Cardiff Royal Infirmary. She met her future husband, the physician Emyr Wyn Jones (1907&#150;1999), on the first sea journey of the Welsh League of Youth in August 1933, and they were married on 9 September 1936. They became actively involved in the cultural and medical life of Wales and of the Liverpool area. They had a daughter, Carys, and a son, Richard Gareth.<br>
<br>The home of the Wyn Joneses at 15 Sandringham Drive, Liverpool, was rendered uninhabitable in 1941 as a result of the massive bombing attacks of the Second World War. As a mother, Enid had to make a secure place for the children at the homestead of Llety'r Eos, Llansannan, Denbighshire, but she continued to visit regularly her second home at 28 Rodney Street, Liverpool. When peace came Llety'r Eos became a lively cultural meeting place for the musicians and poets of the upland rural community of Hiraethog and the adjacent villages. Not only did many famous preachers of Wales, such as Tom Nefyn Williams, visit often, but also many international figures such as Pastor Andr&eacute; Tromc&eacute;, Pastor Martin Niem&ouml;ller, and Danilo Dolci stayed there.<br>
<br>An ecumenical at heart, Enid Wyn Jones belonged to the Presbyterian Church of Wales as well as the Society of Friends. At a time when women preachers were rare she gave substantial service for years to the Welsh-speaking congregations in south Lancashire. Her melodious singing voice and her ability as a pianist were additional assets. She was a fluent speaker who prepared her addresses with meticulous care. She had a great admiration for Rufus Matthew Jones, the American Quaker, and was a friend of the pacifist George Maitland Lloyd Davies and the Quaker writer Elfrida Vipont. She valued her involvement as a member of the religious panel of BBC Wales for six years.<br>
<br>Enid Wyn Jones's involvement in the medical world included membership of the medical executive council of the counties of Denbighshire and Flintshire, followed by service (1960&#150;67) to the Clwyd and Deeside Regional Hospital Board and the North Wales Hospital for Nervous Diseases. She was appointed a member of the nursing advisory committee of the Welsh Regional Hospital Board in 1963, elected its vice-chairman in the same year, and took a leading role in establishing the branch in Wales of the Royal College of Nursing and in the building of its headquarters at T&#375; Maeth, adjacent to the University Hospital, Cardiff.<br>
<br>After several years of practical social welfare in the inner-city and dockland areas of Liverpool, under the aegis of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and the free churches, Enid Wyn Jones was drawn into wider fields of service. She was active in the New Wales Union and in the formation in 1967 of <i>Merched y Wawr</i>. From 1955 she was a justice of the peace for the county of Denbighshire and the petty sessional division of Is-Aled, and she was a member of the British Red Cross Society. Her favourite committee was the North Wales Child Guidance Service. During 1958&#150;9 she was president of the National Free Church Federal Women's Council, being only the second Welsh woman to attain that honour. She became president of the Welsh council of the YWCA, vice-president of the council for England and Wales (1959&#150;67), and a member of the world council of the YWCA, in which capacity she attended world conferences. Towards the end of the quadrennial world council at Melbourne, Australia, in 1967, she sustained, without any warning, a subarachnoid haemorrhage. After a measure of recovery, and accompanied by her husband on the return journey, she had a fatal recurrence on the flight home above Bangkok on 15 September 1967. She was buried at the Henry Rees Memorial Chapel cemetery, Llansannan, on 20 September.<br>
<br>Many of the articles which she contributed to the <span class="italic">Free Church Chronicle</span> and the Welsh press describing her travels were included in the books published after her death and edited by her husband&#151;the bilingual volume <span class="italic">In Memoriam Enid Wyn Jones</span> (1968) and the Welsh language volume <span class="italic">Cyfaredd cof</span> (1970). The article and address that sum up her life of service (delivered at Folkestone in March 1958) is entitled <span class="italic">A Housewife in Search of God</span> and was published as a pamphlet.<br>
