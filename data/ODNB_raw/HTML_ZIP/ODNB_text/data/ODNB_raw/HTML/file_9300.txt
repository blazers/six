<span class="headword">Fenwick,  Francis</span>  (1645&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born in London of an ancient Northumberland family. He entered the English Benedictine priory of St Edmund, Paris, where he was professed on 1 November 1664, and graduated MA from the Sorbonne in 1670, presumably after ordination. He acted as secretary to the president general of the English Benedictines in 1675, and in 1677 became a doctor of theology of the Sorbonne, the same year as his election as a Benedictine master-general. During this period he seems to have acted as tutor to Robert Throckmorton. From 1685 he worked on the English mission in London and preached at the consecration of Bishop Bonaventure Giffard in the banqueting house at Whitehall in April 1688. He returned to Paris to become prior of St Edmund's (1689&#150;93) where he tightened discipline and succeeded in stabilizing the monastery's financial position and ennobling its chapel with a fine organ. As prior he also welcomed the eldest son of the king of Tartary, introducing him, at the request of Dom Joseph Johnston, to Bossuet, who would act as his tutor. He resolutely maintained his Jacobitism in Paris, visiting St Germain and receiving James II in 1693 when the disguised king paid a visit to the monastery. He was opposed to the declaration of toleration for members of the Church of England which the earl of Melfort drew up for James, but continued to act in Paris as the channel of Melfort's correspondence with England, especially that directed to the Anglican Sir John Fenwick. At the general chapter of 1693 James II sought to have him remain in Paris as his chaplain &#145;because the king would find him most useful at this time&#146; and was impressed by his preaching and &#145;his most sweet affable temper&#146;  (Weldon, &#145;Memorials&#146;, 4.84; 1.480). However, the chapter, although initially favourable, eventually appointed him, with the queen's support, as superior for life of the English Benedictine college of St Gregory (or Cajetan College) in Trastevere, Rome, allowing him its revenues for life provided he repaid its debts. In Rome he championed the cause of the English Benedictines against the claims of the vicars apostolic, and acted as the Jacobite agent to the papal court. He died unexpectedly on 30 October 1694 and was buried the following month in the English College, Rome, where his epitaph survives.<br>
