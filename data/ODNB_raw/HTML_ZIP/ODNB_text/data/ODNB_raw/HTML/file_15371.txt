<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Grace</span>  (1782&#150;1825), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at Pinmore, Ayrshire, the fourth daughter of Robert Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1790) and Robina, daughter of John Vans Agnew of Barnbarroch, Galloway. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15394/', "Vans Kennedy")</script> was her brother. Heavy financial losses forced the family to move to Edinburgh while Grace was still a child. Here she was brought up under the instruction of her mother, a devout evangelical protestant. Being of a very retiring disposition, she took no share in the ordinary amusements of society. But her cheerful temper and intellectual attainments made her a delightful companion among intimate friends. She showed an active interest for many years in the education of children, and was led to writing fiction as a means to serve God.<br>
<br>Grace Kennedy's novels (at least eight) were all published anonymously and rapidly in the early 1820s, and met with considerable success, being reissued late into the nineteenth century, often in religious reprint libraries. The first, addressed to adolescent readers and entitled <span class="italic">The Decision, or, Religion must be All, or is Nothing</span> (1821), sets a standard. A mixture of conduct-book instruction and dramatically executed scenes, it tells of a young girl's entrance into London society and her rejection of it in favour of religious duty. <span class="italic">Anna Ross: a Story for Children</span> (1823) replaces the rational Lockean narratives of a previous generation of writers for children, such as Anna Letitia Barbauld and Maria Edgeworth, with an unremitting focus on individual salvation.<br>
<br>1823 also saw the publication of <span class="italic">Father Clement: a Roman Catholic Story</span>, the book by which she is best known. A controversial novel, it set the fashion for tales of suffering Jesuits that continued throughout the nineteenth century. Though written from the protestant viewpoint, it distinguishes between the system (to be condemned) and the individual, the sympathetic Father Clement, whose faith is at issue in a tearful deathbed conclusion. It reached a twelfth edition in 1858, and was translated into several European languages. The anonymous <span class="italic">Father Oswald: a Genuine Catholic Story</span> (1842) declares itself an &#145;antidote&#146; to Kennedy's novel, while <span class="italic">Father Clement</span>'s reputation was still current in 1857 when Miss Pratt, a character in George Eliot's novella <span class="italic">Janet's Repentance</span>, refers to it.<br>
<br>In 1824 appeared <span class="italic">Andrew Campbell's Visit to his Irish Cousins</span> and <span class="italic">Dunallan</span>, Kennedy's longest tale, written before any of the others. After enjoying uninterrupted good health until 1824, Grace Kennedy died unmarried in Edinburgh on 28 February 1825. <span class="italic">Philip Colville, a Covenanter's Story</span>, left unfinished at her death, was published posthumously. It attempts to correct the fanatical picture of the Scottish covenanters painted by Sir Walter Scott in <span class="italic">Old Mortality</span> (1816). A collected edition of Kennedy's works was issued at Edinburgh in 1827 in six volumes, and was reprinted at Brussels in 1836.<br>
