<span class="headword">Blount, Sir  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1403), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, of Barton Blount, Derbyshire, was the third son of Sir John Blount (<i>d</i>. 1358) of Sodington, Worcestershire, and of his first wife, Iseult, daughter and heir of Thomas Mountjoy of Gayton, Staffordshire. Immortalized by Shakespeare as one of the three knights who gave their lives by impersonating Henry IV at the battle of Shrewsbury, Sir Walter was indeed a devoted supporter of the house of Lancaster, to which he owed his advancement, wealth, and influence. He was still a young man when, in 1367, he accompanied John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, on the first of six military expeditions overseas. Five years later he joined the ducal household (of which he became chamberlain in 1392), while also assuming a prominent place in the management of his patron's north midland estates, as constable of Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire, and master forester of Needwood Chase in the same county. So highly did Gaunt value his services that his income as a Lancastrian retainer eventually exceeded &pound;176 a year, thereby enabling him to purchase the Bakepus family's extensive Derbyshire and Leicestershire estates. These gave him a strong territorial base, and augmented the relatively modest possessions which, as a younger son, were all he could hope to inherit.<br>
<br>Blount's marriage, by 1374, to Sancha de Ay&aacute;la, a daughter of Diego Gomez, principal secretary of the province of Toledo, and his wife, Inez de Ay&aacute;la, a favourite lady in waiting of Gaunt's second duchess (herself the elder daughter of Pedro the Cruel, king of Castile), cemented the bond between him and the duke. It also gave him a vested interest in Gaunt's claim to the throne of Castile, and made him an obvious choice as diplomatic envoy to the Iberian peninsula. He undertook two long missions to Castile, in 1378 and 1393, evidently acquitting himself well, despite the overwhelming odds against success; and he later served as an ambassador to Portugal and Aragon for Gaunt's son, the newly crowned Henry IV, in 1400. Further evidence of Blount's negotiating skills may be found in his presence, in 1383, as ducal representative at peace talks on the Scottish border. Blount had to draw upon his military and diplomatic experience nearer home, for the gentry of the north midlands resented Gaunt's intervention in local issues. His position as the duke's leading retainer in Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where he also sat on the bench in the 1380s, was fraught with difficulties, but he continued to enjoy every mark of confidence from his patron. Gaunt made him an executor of his will, and left him a personal bequest of 100 marks. His trust was not misplaced: when Henry Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur, in July 1399, to recover the confiscated duchy of Lancaster from Richard II, Blount welcomed him with one of the largest private retinues then marshalled by his supporters.<br>
<br>A mainstay of the new regime, Blount represented Derbyshire in the first parliament of Henry's reign. He was entrusted with the care and tutelage of the young Prince Thomas, who, in 1402, became lieutenant of Ireland. In death, as in life, Blount honoured the ties of good lordship, asking in his will of 1401 to be buried at the Lancastrian foundation of St Mary in the Newarke, Leicester. This wish was fulfilled after the battle of Shrewsbury, where he was killed. Sancha Blount survived until 1418 or 1419 as a pensioner of the crown, and was buried beside him. They had five sons, the most celebrated of whom, <a name="cosubject_2689"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Blount</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1418), became a <span class="occ">knight of the Garter</span> and fell at the siege of Rouen. His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_2695"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Blount</span>  (<em>c.</em>1383&#150;1456), who had been intended for the church, in turn assumed the Lancastrian livery, and rose high in royal service to be made <span class="occ">treasurer of Normandy</span>. In recognition of two generations of unstinting loyalty, Prince Thomas set aside 1000 marks for the erection of a splendid Blount family chantry at St Mary's.<br>
