<span class="headword">Webbe,  Joseph</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1630), <span class="occ">linguist and physician</span>, was said to be from Dorset when, as a Roman Catholic, he visited the English College at Rome in 1600. Details of his parentage and of the date and place of his birth are unknown but he was perhaps related to the old Catholic family of Webb in Canford Magna, Dorset, who sent their children abroad to Catholic seminaries and convents for their education. Webbe, having obtained a foreign doctorate, returned to the English College at Rome on 12 November 1603 and, since no date of departure is recorded, he may have stayed there for some time. By 1612 he had obtained two doctorates, both noted on the title-page of his <span class="italic">Minae coelestes</span> (1612) as &#145;Phi.&#146; and &#145;Me.D.&#146;. This text consists largely of a set of tables which list, according to astrological predictions, the most unlucky days in 1612 for dealing with various diseases. The second degree was obtained at Padua and Webbe probably studied at Bologna as well, since one of the dedicatees of <span class="italic">Minae</span> is G. Antonio Magino, a distinguished mathematician whom Webbe describes as a most celebrated teacher at Bologna.<br>
<br>Webbe's association with Italy continued at least until 1614, when he published in Florence what he describes, in <span class="italic">Usus et authoritas</span> (1626, preface), as his &#145;universal tables&#146; (now lost but probably similar to those in <span class="italic">Minae coelestes</span>). Thereafter his name occurs in English contexts, first in 1616, when he was a candidate for a licence to practise medicine, which the Royal College of Physicians agreed to award subject to his obtaining incorporation at either Oxford or Cambridge University. In 1626 the college noted that he had failed to do so, though he may have practised illegally since an anti-Catholic contemporary includes him in a list of &#145;popish Physicians&#146;. However, he made a living teaching languages by his own unique method at his house in Black and White Court in the Old Bailey. His system interested Samuel Hartlib, who instigated a debate on its merits between Webbe and another schoolmaster, William Brookes; the relevant correspondence is preserved in British Library, Sloane MS 1466. Having published a translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">Familiar Epistles</span> in 1620 Webbe set out on his major project of language teaching, using his new methods in works published between 1626 and 1629. But eventually he admitted that his &#145;gaping Grave&#146; was &#145;calling&#146; him  (J. Webbe, <span class="italic">Andria</span>, 1629, sig. &para; 4<i>r</i>) and he died soon afterwards, possibly in financial difficulties, without achieving his goal of publishing in his new format all of Terence's comedies.<br>
<br>Webbe contributed to the development of language teaching and of linguistic thought generally in three respects. The first of these was in his strong support of, and reasoned arguments for, the teaching of any language by the &#145;direct&#146; method, in which students learned Latin, for example, by imitating phrases from classical authors; he strongly opposed the alternative method of first learning paradigms on which students constructed their own sentences. Such a debate was not uncommon in the sixteenth century, one participant being Georgius Haloinus Cominius (<i>c</i>.1473&#150;1536), a Belgian scholar whose <span class="italic">De restauratione linguae latinae</span> (1533) Webbe frequently cites. Webbe's most important contribution to this discussion was to design and publish relevant textbooks, for the production of which he solicited financial support from subscribers. He explained his ideas in <span class="italic">An Appeale to Truth, in the Controversie, betweene Art, &amp; Use</span> (1622), where &#145;art&#146; refers to grammar and &#145;use&#146; to the usage of the learned; he also pleaded for parliament's support in <span class="italic">A Petition</span> (1623), which led to the grant in 1626 of a patent giving him the monopoly of teaching languages by his method for thirty-one years. His textbooks, which gave both the original Latin and Webbe's translation, were designed with the use of various typographical devices to enable students to see at a glance the links between the Latin phrases and their English equivalents. His system became progressively more complicated, beginning with <span class="italic">Lessons and Exercises out of Cicero</span> (1627) and ending with two comedies by Terence, <span class="italic">Eunuchus</span> and <span class="italic">Andria</span> (1629). Webbe also published a dictionary of phrases from Ovid, with which students could form new sentences and verses in imitation of the Latin original.<br>
<br>Webbe's second contribution to linguistic thought was to draw attention to the difficulties involved in translation, such as those that related to word order and idiomatic usage. His third contribution was an analysis, preserved in Sloane MS 1466, of the nature of language acquisition. In this work he sees the child's acquisition of language as an automatic reaction in an appropriate context, where the child learns the meaning of the word drink, for example, when he is given a pot to drink from, and he compares this situation to a dog's reaction to the sound of a bell. The dog, &#145;once hearinge the bell and presently feeling the lash, will never after heare the bell, but will runne away barking or crying, out of a memory of the former punishment&#146;  (Salmon, &#145;Problems&#146;, 9).<br>
<br>Webbe's work was highly valued by younger contemporaries, such as the eminent schoolmaster Thomas Hayne (<i>d</i>. 1645), and later by John Webster (1611&#150;1682), who argued that if only Webbe's method had been followed it would have been an &#145;incredible advantage to the whole nation&#146;  (J. Webster, <span class="italic">Examination of Academies</span>, 1654, 3). He has also been praised by more recent scholars, such as Foster Watson, who describes the <span class="italic">Petition</span> as an &#145;outstanding educational document&#146;  (F. Watson, <span class="italic">The English Grammar Schools to 1660</span>, 1908, 285&#150;6); but his method ultimately failed because it was superseded, from about 1630, by the internationally known and admired language teaching system of J. A. Comenius.<br>
