<span class="headword">Agnew, Sir  Andrew</span>  (1882&#150;1955), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born on 28 February 1882 at 30 Roxburgh Street, Greenock, the son of Andrew Agnew, grocer, and his wife, Margaret. He was educated at Holmscroft School in Greenock. In 1912 he married Belle McKissock, daughter of James McClymont of Girvan; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Agnew's career in the oil industry began in 1903 when he went to the Far East as a member of the staff of Messrs Syme &amp; Co., agents for marketing Shell oil in the Straits Settlements. After two years he was promoted to take charge of their petroleum agency work. When Asiatic Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell's marketing company, opened its own office in Singapore in 1908, Agnew transferred to their staff and in 1911 was appointed manager and Shell's representative in the Singapore area. During his time in Singapore, Agnew was very active in the local community, being a member of the legislative council of the Straits Settlements and a justice of the peace. He also held positions on the Singapore Harbour Board and the Singapore chamber of commerce. In the First World War Agnew remained in the Far East, where he was commandant of the Singapore civil guard and chairman of the Mesopotamian river craft committee, which was responsible for dispatching workers and supplies to Mesopotamia. In 1918 he was made a CBE for this work, and was one of the first to be awarded this new distinction.<br>
<br>In 1919 Agnew returned to London, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was appointed manager of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of Shell, in 1920. Two years later he was made a director of Shell Transport and Trading (one of the Shell group's two parent companies), as well as of Asiatic Petroleum and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum. In 1924 he was appointed to the board of N. V. de Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, Shell's Dutch company. In 1935 Agnew became managing director of Shell Transport and Trading, a position he held until ill health forced him to retire in 1953. His style of leadership was very personal. He was in constant correspondence with Shell offices throughout the world. All staff returning to London on leave were interviewed very thoroughly by him to ascertain detailed facts about their areas of business. He was also in close contact with the other Shell managing directors, especially with Frederick Godber, managing director from 1929 and chairman from 1946, with whom he had a family connection, as one of his sons married one of Godber's daughters. Agnew was energetic in his work, and a man of action rather than of long-term planning. He was described by a colleague as &#145;the very picture of a rugged Scot, and his actions did not belie his appearance&#146;  (Oriel, 215). His interests lay in dealing with immediate market shares and pricing, and negotiations with governments, especially during the difficult trading conditions of the depression. He played a key role, along with Sir John Cadman, chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in the organization of the so-called &#145;As-Is&#146; oil cartel, agreed at Achnacarry Castle, Scotland, in 1928, and this largely determined the strategies of the major oil companies in the 1930s  (Ferrier, 463).<br>
<br>Agnew's interests and influence extended beyond Shell to the wider petroleum industry. In 1923 the UK government proposed a petroleum bill, much of which was unacceptable to the industry. Agnew was chosen by the oil companies as one of two representatives to conduct their negotiations, which were ultimately successful. During the Second World War Agnew was chairman of the Petroleum Board, being unanimously nominated for the position by the British oil companies. The board ensured that competition between the oil companies was suspended in order to provide adequate supplies of oil. The success of this endeavour was due largely to Agnew's extensive knowledge of the oil industry and the respect that he commanded within it. He was elected to serve as president of the Institute of Petroleum, the industry's trade body, from 1946 to 1948.<br>
<br>Agnew received many honours in addition to being made a CBE. He was knighted in 1938, was created a Commander of the order of Orange Nassau in 1939 and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was awarded the United States medal of freedom with silver palm. He died of a cerebral thrombosis on 4 March 1955 at his home at Glenlee Park, Kells, Kirkcudbrightshire, having suffered from ill health for the previous few years, and was buried two days later in Kells cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
