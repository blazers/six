<span class="headword">Odington <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Evesham]</span>,  Walter</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1280&#150;1301), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and scholar</span>, was also known as Walter Evesham and as Walter de Otyngton, monk of Evesham, and has in the past had his identity masked by sixteenth-century bibliographers, who attributed important treatises on music and science to separate writers bearing some variants of these names. Thus Leland ascribed the scientific works to an Odendunus active around 1280, and the musical treatise to a Gualterius de Evesham, whom Bale described as working about 1240. Only with the reintegration of these two figures into one has a more accurate assessment of his work become possible.<br>
<br>Odington was probably born at Oddington in Oxfordshire and became a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Evesham near Worcester, for which he produced a <span class="italic">Kalendarium</span> beginning with the year 1301. In 1298 he was named in the distinguished company of the abbots of Malmesbury, Tewkesbury, and Pershore as a member of a committee for the administration of Gloucester College, the Benedictine college at Oxford for monks of the Canterbury province. In 1463 William Worcester noted on a manuscript of a <span class="italic">Declaratio motus octavae spherae</span> that it was the work of &#145;Master Walter Evesham who made his deliberations at Oxford about 1316&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 674, fol. 75<i>r</i>). On this basis Odington has been misidentified with a Walter Evesham who was a fellow of Merton College documented between <i>c</i>.1331 and 1346. (He was also confused with Walter of Eynsham, an unsuccessful candidate for the see of Canterbury in 1228.) A fellowship of Merton and membership of a religious order were mutually exclusive, and if Odington did indeed work at Oxford it would presumably have been at Gloucester College. John North has questioned Worcester's note, arguing for the accuracy of Leland's estimate that Odington flourished <i>c</i>.1280, thus placing his birth around 1260 or earlier. The date of the <span class="italic">Kalendarium</span> and the placement of Odington's musical treatise about 1300 extend the period of his activity into the fourteenth century.<br>
<br>Surviving works ascribed to &#145;Frater Walterus de Evesham&#146; consist of an alchemical treatise, the <span class="italic">Ycocedron</span> (so called from its division into twenty&#151;<i>eikosi</i>&#151;chapters), extant entire or in part in five manuscript sources  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Digby 119; ed. P. D. Thomas); the <span class="italic">Summa de speculatione musicae</span>, in three manuscripts  (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 410; ed. F. Hammond); a <span class="italic">Tractatus de multiplicatione specierum in visu</span>; an <span class="italic">Ars metrica</span>; a compilation of the fifth book of Euclid; and the almanac for Evesham  (all CUL, MS Ii.1.13). The <span class="italic">Declaratio motus octavae spherae</span> occurs in two manuscript sources of which MS Laud misc. 674 in the Bodleian Library (ed. J. D. North) contains Worcester's note. John of Ashenden, writing in 1347, ascribes to Odington another work, a treatise on the age of the world: &#145;Odynton monachus de Evesham in suo tractatu de etate mundi&#146;  (Oxford, Oriel College, MS 23). Leland ascribes to Odendunus a <span class="italic">Kalendarium</span>, a treatise on planetary motions, and a treatise <i>de mutatione aeris</i>. Tanner, two centuries after Leland, reunites the two Odingtons and lists among his works the <span class="italic">Summa</span> (which he knew at first hand), <span class="italic">Ycocedron</span>, <span class="italic">Declaratio</span>, <span class="italic">De aetate mundi</span>, and planetary tables. (Thorndike's assignment of Richard Wallingford's <span class="italic">Exafrenon</span> and an <span class="italic">Ars completa</span> to Odington has been dismissed by North.)<br>
<br>Odington's importance, like the story of his life, has been as much obscured as it has been clarified by historians. The manuscript tradition of his works suggests that his scientific writings&#151;notably the <span class="italic">Ycocedron</span> on the fascinating subject of alchemy&#151;were of greatest interest to his contemporaries. North points out that the <span class="italic">Ycocedron</span> suggests the possibility of quantitative measurement of certain virtues, such as heat and dryness, and that Odington employs the concept of intension and remission of qualities, a terminology which he also applied to musical pitch. However, the first of Odington's treatises to be published in a modern edition was not the <span class="italic">Ycocedron</span> but the treatise on music, the <span class="italic">Summa</span>  (Coussemaker, <span class="italic">L'Art harmonique</span>, 1865); but the importance of this work has been distorted by inaccurate dating and inappropriate scholarly claims.<br>
<br>Owing to Bale's separation of the scientific writer from the author of the musical treatise, which he dated more than half a century before its probable composition, the <span class="italic">Summa</span> appeared a prodigy to later scholars. Charles Burney&#151;that rich source of slightly inaccurate information&#151;in 1776 accepted the dating of <i>c</i>.1240, and was followed by F&eacute;tis, Coussemaker, and Eitner. The <span class="italic">Summa</span> was also seized upon by Hugo Riemann, who employed its misdating in order to claim the treatise as the source of two &#145;progressive&#146; and &#145;English&#146; tendencies, the theoretical recognition of duple metre and the acceptance of the third as a consonance. The first is a misreading, but Odington did raise the question of employing intervals of the third and sixth as musical consonances, which was admitted in practice in fourteenth-century music, although such intervals lacked the theoretical justification of the simple mathematical proportions demonstrated by the octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), and fourth (4:3).<br>
<br>Far from being an isolated monument, as Burney claimed, the <span class="italic">Summa de speculatione musicae</span> fits into the context of Odington's other work as one element in a corpus of treatises encompassing the mathematical arts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The encyclopaedic character of Odington's musical treatise resembles the apparently little-known work of Jerome of Moravia, dated between 1272 and 1304, and the <span class="italic">Speculum musicae</span> of Jacques de Li&egrave;ge (<i>c</i>.1330). The first four of the six books comprising the <span class="italic">Summa</span> are theoretical in nature. Book I deals with arithmetic, Book II with music as number related to sound. Book III demonstrates these proportions in a discussion of musical instruments on a theoretical rather than a practical level. Book IV treats poetic metres as examples of the same proportional relationships. Book V is a tonary, a handbook of ecclesiastical chant, and Book VI comprises a treatise on writing metred polyphonic music or discant. Most of Odington's sources are conventional ones: Boethius's <span class="italic">De arithmetica</span> and <span class="italic">De musica</span> for Books I&#150;II, the <span class="italic">De musica</span> and a number of anonymous treatises for Book III, Isidore of Seville's <span class="italic">Etymologiarum</span> for Book IV, the Sarum <span class="italic">Tonale</span> for Book V, and the works of Jean Garland (<i>c</i>.1240) and Jerome of Moravia for Book VI. However, Odington also cites lesser-known writers such as Fulgentius and Avicenna, and the division of knowledge which he ascribes to Adelard of Bath follows one attributed to Garland by Jerome.<br>
<br>In his description of musical forms and genres, Odington was the only musical theorist to describe the rondellus, a three-voice piece based on a technique of canonic voice exchange, which was &#145;known as typically and rather quaintly English as early as <i>c</i>.1225&#146;  (Sanders, &#145;Rondellus&#146;, 171) and disappeared after 1300. This genre forms an important part of the musical fragments connected with Worcester Cathedral&#151;only 15 miles from Evesham Abbey&#151;between <i>c</i>.1270 and <i>c</i>.1290.<br>
