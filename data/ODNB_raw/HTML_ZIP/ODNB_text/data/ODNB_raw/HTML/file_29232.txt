</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitby,  Daniel</span>  (1637/8&#150;1726), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Rushden, Northamptonshire (on 24 March 1638 according to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, a date which has not been substantiated). His father, Thomas Whitby (<i>fl</i>. 1620&#150;1638), was rector of the parish but moved soon after his son's birth to Barrow-on-Humber, Lincolnshire. His uncle and namesake was rector of Theydon Mount, Essex, but was ejected during the civil war, and became a canon of Chichester at the Restoration. Daniel matriculated as a commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, on 23 July 1653, was elected scholar on 13 June 1655, aged seventeen, graduated BA on 20 April 1657 and MA on 14 April 1660, and was elected fellow of Trinity in 1664. He then found favour with the bishop of Salisbury and former president of Trinity, Seth Ward, who made him his chaplain in 1668 and preferred him lavishly in his Salisbury diocese. On top of a valuable prebend and the rectory of St Edmund's, Whitby became precentor in September 1672&#151;a dignity he held until his death&#151;and a canon residentiary in June 1676. He accumulated BD and DD on 13 September 1672.<br>
<br>Whitby's first publications (three anti-Roman works in 1664, 1666, and 1674, and an apologetical treatise in 1671 to withstand &#145;the encrease of Atheism and Irreligion&#146;; D. Whitby, <span class="italic"><i>Logos t&#275;s piste&#333;s</i>, or, An Endeavour to Evince the Certainty of Christian Faith</span>, 1671, 2) were fully consonant with orthodox Oxford divinity. Whitby was well read in the fathers, especially the Greek ones, provided some assistance for the preparation of John Fell's Cyprian, and was for years a great admirer of Henry Dodwell, with whom he &#145;had once the honour of an intimate acquaintance&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Cherry 23, 259). His first deviation was his <span class="italic">Discourse concerning the laws ecclesiastical and civil made against hereticks by popes, emperors and kings</span> (1682), to show what protestants might expect to suffer under a popish prince. The book was published anonymously and Whitby managed to hide his authorship until 1726, when he claimed it for himself in his last collection of sermons. Although he avoided advocating exclusion explicitly, such was clearly the conclusion that the reader was invited to draw for himself, all the more so as Whitby insisted that no resistance was allowed once a prince had lawfully come to power. He was certainly sincere but this was also a subtle move to turn tory theology against the tories.<br>
<br>Whitby made fuller use of this tactic in his <span class="italic">Protestant reconciler, humbly pleading for condescention to dissenting brethren, in things indifferent and unnecessary for the sake of peace, and shewing how unreasonable it is to make such things the necessary conditions of communion</span>, also published anonymously (with the imprint of 1683 but actually issued in November 1682), arguing that the very heinousness of schism, as represented by Church of England writers, made it incumbent upon ecclesiastical authorities to cease to impose indifferent ceremonies &#145;which do occasion the Schism, and consequently the destruction of so many precious and immortal Souls&#146;  (D. Whitby, <span class="italic">Protestant Reconciler</span>, 1683, 30&#150;31). Although Whitby stated that dissenters were guilty too, the <span class="italic">Protestant Reconciler</span> caused an outcry in ecclesiastical circles and its author, who was soon identified, was subjected to much abuse. He vainly tried to defuse the crisis by hastening to issue, in June 1683, a second part to exhort dissenters to conformity. Nicknamed Whigby, he was even accused of having encouraged the Rye House plot. Two propositions extracted from the <span class="italic">Reconciler</span> were condemned by the Oxford decree of 21 July 1683, and the book was among those subsequently burnt in the schools quadrangle. Whitby had to make a public submission in Salisbury at the bishop's consistory on 9 October 1683, declaring himself &#145;truly and heartily sorry&#146; for his book, professing to &#145;revoke and renounce all irreverent and unmeet Expressions contained therein&#146; and engaging never to print anything hereafter without episcopal approbation (Sykes, vi&#150;vii; Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 34, fol. 182<i>r</i>). Whitby protested later that this had not been a recantation:<blockquote>That very Morning that I was to make my Submission to the then present Chancellor, I declared, that if any such Thing was required of me, I would rather lose all, be imprisoned and die, than I would do it. (D. Whitby, <span class="italic">A Full Answer to the Arguments of the Reverend Dr. Jonathan Edwards</span>, 1712, vii)</blockquote>However, his declaration certainly went under that title, being first circulated in manuscript and then printed in L'Estrange's <span class="italic">Observator</span>. The Latin manual of ethics which he published in 1684 and which later became a favourite of the Oxford curriculum underwent censure on these questions.<br>
<br>Whitby was not at the end of his troubles, as his case became part of the fierce conflict at Salisbury Cathedral between Ward and Dean Thomas Pierce. The latter's party declared Whitby's submission unsatisfactory and, in the aftermath of Monmouth's rebellion, tried to have him presented at the assizes in September 1685. Whitby was only saved by a certificate &#145;from the bishop, Chapter and severall Loyall Justices of the Peace, that hee had behaved himself very loyally&#146; since 1683  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 143, fol. 117<i>r</i>). To justify himself further he published three ultra-tory sermons, in which he taught passive obedience, confuted Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Julian</span>, and even flirted with the patriarchal scheme. The whole affair must have been traumatic for Whitby and may explain his readiness, later in his life, to side with &#145;heretics&#146; against the tide of clerical feeling.<br>
<br>The politics of James II brought Whitby in line again with dominant Anglican opinion. He contributed his patristic learning to the anti-Roman campaign, offering expert advice and writing himself against image worship, divine service in Latin, and traditions. After the revolution of 1688&#150;9 he had serious scruples about taking the oaths to William and Mary, and almost resolved at one point to become a non-juror, though less because of &#145;the supposed unlawfuness of complyance&#146; than of &#145;the scandal it is like to minister&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 34, fol. 16<i>r</i>). He managed to satisfy himself, however, and then characteristically rushed into print with four pamphlets to demonstrate that allegiance is due to a king <i>de facto</i>.<br>
<br>Whitby was close to Gilbert Burnet, his new bishop, who chose him as godfather of his son, Gilbert junior, and promoted him in April 1696 to the prebend of Teynton Regis, the richest of the diocese. He now spent most of his time on his <span class="italic">Paraphrase and Commentary on the New Testament</span>. The epistles came out first in 1700 (with a dedication to Burnet who is thanked for having perused and approved the work), and the whole was published in 1703 in two folio volumes. It was regularly reprinted and considered a classic in the eighteenth century. The commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 13 shows Whitby fully converted to whig theories of contract and resistance. His extreme Arminianism, which led him to deny any imputation of Adam's sin to his posterity, engaged him in a violent controversy with both John and Jonathan Edwards. According to his own account Whitby, having been &#145;bred up Seven Years in the University under Men of the Calvinistical Persuasion&#146;, had &#145;once firmly entertained all their Doctrines&#146; but went on to abandon them as contrary &#145;to the common Reason of Mankind&#146; and conducive to disbelief and deism  (D. Whitby, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning, 1: The True Import of the Words Election and Reprobation</span>, 1710, iii&#150;v). He may have struggled for some time to reconcile his new views with the articles and the liturgy, and is said to have declined the deanery of Salisbury to avoid a new subscription. However, he held eventually that it was lawful to subscribe &#145;in any Sense, of which the words are fairly, and <i>Grammatically</i> capable&#146;  (D. Whitby, &#145;An answer to a pamphlet&#146;, <span class="italic">Reflections on some Assertions and Opinions of Mr Dodwell</span>, 1707, 10).<br>
<br>When preparing his <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, Whitby had failed to obtain communication of John Mill's then unpublished work and clearly resented the rebuke. This partly accounts for his most famous piece, the <span class="italic">Examen variantium lectionum Millii</span> (1710), in which he argued that such a huge collection of variants was undermining the certainty of scripture and played into the hands of papists and atheists. Whitby's reaction was thoroughly theological; indeed, according to Hearne he &#145;hardly knows what a manuscript is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.112). Freethinkers, starting with Anthony Collins, seized upon it gleefully and it was therefore mercilessly ridiculed by Richard Bentley in his <span class="italic">Remarks upon a Late Discourse of Free-Thinking</span>  (1713, pp. 63&#150;9).<br>
<br>Whitby's anti-Romanism remained fierce to the last and he was increasingly worried by what he perceived as the Romanizing tendencies of the high-church party: hence his furious attack against William Beveridge's posthumous writings in 1711. He had long been an orthodox trinitarian and had published in 1691 a Latin treatise on Christ's divinity which was heavily indebted to George Bull's <span class="italic">Defensio</span>, but he was won over to Samuel Clarke's <span class="italic">Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity</span> and entered into a correspondence with the author, putting at his disposal the extended knowledge of the ante-Nicene fathers which was his forte (&#145;for the reasons are much beyond me&#146;; BL, Add. MS 4370, fol. 8<i>r</i>). He first entered the debate anonymously, but afterwards published under his name an attack against Bull (<span class="italic">Disquisitiones modestae in clarissimi Bulli defensionem fidei Nicaenae</span>, 1718) and defended it against Daniel Waterland in 1720 and 1721. In his profession of faith, which he arranged to be published after his death by his young friend Arthur Ashley Sykes, he retracted what he had written in his <span class="roman">New Testament</span> when he had been following &#145;the common beaten Road of other reputed Orthodox divines&#146;  (Sykes, sig. A2<i>r</i>). His final position has occasionally been labelled unitarian but should more properly be described as Arianism. It explains, together with his dislike of high-churchmanship, his <span class="italic">Dissertatio de S. scripturarum interpretatione secundum patrum commentarios</span> (1714), in which he turned his patristic learning against the fathers, collecting their mistakes in order to show that they were neither adequate interpreters of scripture nor sufficient authorities to settle the debate on the Trinity. He repeated the same principles in the Bangorian controversy of 1718, in which he sided with Benjamin Hoadly.<br>
<br>According to Wood, Whitby &#145;hath been all along so wholly devoted to his severer studies, that he hath scarce ever allowed himself leisure to mind&#146; anything else  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 671). He never married and seems to have lived with his sister. His life is very much the story of his books (he published nearly fifty, including pamphlets and sermons). In his old age he had to employ an amanuensis because his sight was failing, but he retained his tenacious memory. He was short and very thin, and his features in his engraved portrait are rather severe; a portrait &#145;seems to have been presented&#146; to Trinity in 1844 but &#145;is now nowhere to be found&#146;  (Pool, 146). His minute examination of Mill's variants would alone bear witness to his industry. On the other hand, he wrote bad Latin&#151;according to Hearne this was &#145;school Boy Jargon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.21)&#151;and his English style was not better; there is some truth in John Edwards's cruel description: &#145;he is a great Pains-taker, and may be said to slave at the Work of Book-Making: But the Labour consists chiefly in Transcribing and in Repetitions&#146;  (Edwards, xii). Whitby certainly relished long quotations and was adept at reusing his own works in his later writings. He also unavoidably contradicted himself several times, the most blatant instance, as his orthodox opponents were eager to point out, being his notion of the Trinity.<br>
<br>Whitby could hardly be considered an original thinker and, anyway, the majority of his books were meant to expose and confute the errors of others rather than to expound a personal position. They were none the less influential, and the Latin ones were much read and commented upon on the continent (they were all put on the Roman index in 1757). Whitby was consistently driven by the dread of popery, the tendency to reduce religion to plain morality, and the dislike of subtleties, be they those of theological speculation, of sacramentalism, or of textual criticism. Throughout his long career, from Restoration orthodoxy to the age of reason, he remained a latitudinarian, for whom Chillingworth's <span class="italic">Religion of Protestants</span> and Taylor's <span class="italic">Liberty of Prophesying</span> provided essential references.<br>
<br>Whitby died in Salisbury on 21 March 1726. He had been very well and at church the day before, but &#145;returning Home was seiz'd with a Fainting, and died the Night following&#146;, aged eighty-eight  (Sykes, ii).<br>
