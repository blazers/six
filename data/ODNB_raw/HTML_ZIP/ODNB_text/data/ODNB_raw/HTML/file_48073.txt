<span class="headword">Mortimer,  William Egerton</span>  (1878&#150;1940), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 9 August 1878 in Ash, Shropshire, the son of Christian Mortimer (<i>d</i>. 1916), vicar of Ash and later canon residentiary of Lichfield Cathedral, and his wife, Lucy Sarah Hannah Scholfield. Canon Mortimer was one of the seventeen children of George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer, headmaster of the City of London School between 1840 and 1865. Mortimer was educated at Shrewsbury School before reading Greats at Christ Church, Oxford, where he held the Careswell and Boulter exhibitions, was president of the boat club, and took a second in jurisprudence in 1901.<br>
<br>In October 1904 Mortimer was admitted a solicitor; he then practised alone at 21 Cannon Street for eight years. During this time it seems that he made the acquaintance of William May, partner of and co-founder in 1889, with William Slaughter, of the City firm known then and ever since as Slaughter and May. Mortimer's name is entered as a member of various shooting parties, from 1908 on, in the gamebook of Pitt Hall Farm, an estate near Basingstoke belonging to William May. Mortimer was also, like May, a keen yachtsman, although no record survives of whether these shared sporting interests played any part in securing for Mortimer an invitation, which he accepted, to join Slaughter and May as a partner. In 1912 Mortimer left Cannon Street and became one of the five partners at 18 Austin Friars.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1914 Mortimer was thirty-six and too old for active military service. He spent most of the war at Austin Friars, although in 1917 he was seconded to the Air Ministry for a time. Sir William Slaughter, the firm's senior partner since 1889, died in 1917 and many of his clients and directorships were passed on to William May. Mortimer, who already shared some of the firm's significant commercial clients, particularly banks, in the City with May, took on more of these in the 1920s. The merchant banks Schroders, Barings, and Rothschilds were all clients of the firm and more specifically of Mortimer in the 1920s. When Sir Frank Crisp of Ashurst Morris Crisp died in 1919, Morgan Grenfell, formerly his client, moved to Slaughter and May. By the mid-1920s Mortimer's reputation was sufficient to warrant an invitation to sit on the committee chaired by Wilfrid Arthur Greene, appointed in 1925 to review the body of company law and consider what, if any, amendments were required. In the event the committee, after lengthy sittings, recommended only some slight changes.<br>
<br>From the late 1920s until 1940 Mortimer was, according to the firm's historian, its driving force, although he did not become senior partner until 1933. In these years, as his own reputation and that of the firm grew in the City, the firm acquired &#145;the stamp of Mortimer's complex and forceful personality&#146;  (Dennett, 158). From 1924 he was a member of the council of the Law Society, but otherwise he did not seek influence in wider public spheres. He was well known among British and foreign bankers, particularly after his involvement, representing British interests, in the creation of the foreign creditors' standstill committee, set up after the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in 1931.<br>
<br>City law firms were at this time&#151;and most remained so until the 1960s&#151;hierarchical and conservative in character, formal in dress and manners. In the office, Mortimer&#151;known as Mortie, although whether any dared to address him as such is doubtful&#151;was autocratic and demanding, a stickler for accuracy as far as work and behaviour were concerned. A bachelor himself at this time, he dedicated his considerable energies and abilities to Slaughter and May and tended to expect the same of his partners and staff. He could also, however, as articled clerks and members of staff found, be unobtrusively kind and generous.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Slaughter and May, with nine partners, was a large firm in City terms and with a reputation for excellence that Mortimer had done much to sustain and enhance after the deaths of the founders. On 7 or 8 August 1938 Mortimer married Cicely Eleanor, widow of Major-General Neville-White and daughter of William Melville Pigot, rural dean of Ipswich. Two years later, while sheltering from an air raid, he suffered a heart attack. A few days later, on 3 December 1940, he died of bronchitis at his home at 95 Eaton Square, London; his wife survived him.<br>
