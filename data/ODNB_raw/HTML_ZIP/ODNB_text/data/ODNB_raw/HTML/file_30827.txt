</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bliss, Sir  Arthur Edward Drummond</span>  (1891&#150;1975), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 2 August 1891 at Hawthornden, Queen's Ride, Barnes Common, Barnes, Surrey, the eldest of three sons of Francis Edward Bliss (<i>d</i>. 1930), an American businessman from Massachusetts, and his second wife, Agnes Kennard Davis (1858&#150;1895). There was one son from a previous marriage.<br>
<br>On his wife's death in 1895, Francis Bliss took over the upbringing of Bliss and his brothers Francis Kennard (1892&#150;1916) and James Howard (1894&#150;1977). Untypically for the period, he was not a remote figurehead, but an active and devoted parent. His response to the situation was characteristic of his New England sensibility, with its sense of duty and high thinking, qualities he passed on to his sons. From his father Bliss gained too a love of visual arts, theatre, classical history, and mythology, all of which would be manifest in his works. Bliss frequently drew inspiration from the technical processes of painting and sculpture; among his friends were Jacob Epstein and Paul Nash. Classical mythology is the inspiration behind Bliss's <span class="italic">Hymn to Apollo</span> (1926) as well as the <span class="italic">Pastoral</span> (1928); and the theatrical sense displayed in his film scores, ballets, and operas may be traced to his early enthusiasms.<br>
<br>In 1900 Bliss was sent to Bilton Grange, the preparatory school for Rugby School, which he attended from 1905 to 1910. He then went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, with a classical exhibition, but also studied composition with Charles Wood and found a stimulating mentor in Edward Dent. He graduated BA and MusB in 1913, then spent a year at the Royal College of Music, London. Although he found his teacher, Charles Stanford, uninspiring, he was part of an outstanding generation of talented musicians including Herbert Howells, Ivor Gurney, Arthur Benjamin, and Eugene Goossens. At this time he also met Edward Elgar, who offered encouragement.<br>
<br>During the First World War Bliss served with distinction and gallantry in the 13th Royal Fusiliers (1914&#150;17) and the Grenadier Guards (1917&#150;19). He was wounded in 1916 during the battle of the Somme, gassed at Cambrai in 1918, and mentioned in dispatches in 1916. However, the death of his brother Kennard in action had a long-lasting effect on him, and the futility of war was engraved on his personality. Its deepest musical expression is the choral symphony <span class="italic">Morning Heroes</span> (1930); but it also surfaces in sudden shifts in his music to threatening, malevolent moods, for example in the interlude &#145;Through the Valley of the Shadow of Death&#146; in <span class="italic">Meditations on a Theme by John Blow</span> (1955). His abhorrence of time-wasting was a further result of his war years. He knew how fortunate he was to have survived, and was determined not to lose a moment's opportunity&#151;as witnessed by contemporary descriptions of him immediately after the war which portray a forthright young man bursting with energy and purpose. These qualities are vividly evoked too in Wyndham Lewis's lithe pencil sketch of 1922. Bliss was received into the Roman Catholic church in 1918.<br>
<br>During the war a string quartet (<i>c</i>.1914) and piano quartet (1914&#150;15) were performed and published, although Bliss subsequently withdrew them. It was with a series of original ensemble works, many of them with voice, that he established his name immediately after the war: <span class="italic">Madam Noy</span> (1918), <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Conversations</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Rout</span> (1920), and incidental music for Viola Tree's production of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1921). Influenced by Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky and showing an allegiance to the French composers known as &#145;Les six&#146;, they startled the conservative critics of the day by their modernity, and gained Bliss considerable notoriety.<br>
<br>Bliss's first major orchestral work, <span class="italic">A Colour Symphony</span> (1921&#150;2), commissioned by the 1922 Gloucester Three Choirs Festival at Elgar's instigation, consolidated his reputation as a major figure in British contemporary music. The work adumbrates the mature composer. In the ceremonial grandeur of its outer movements it hints at an embryonic master of the queen's music; the balletic scherzo looks forward to his dance scores; while the introspective slow movement points to the deeper, personal utterance of <span class="italic">Morning Heroes</span>. Stravinsky's influence has been absorbed in the frequent dissonance, as has the pomp and circumstance of Elgar.<br>
<br>In 1923 Bliss travelled to the USA with his father, who had remarried and wished to spend his last years in his homeland. They settled in Santa Barbara, California, where Bliss met Gertrude (Trudy) Hoffmann (<i>b</i>. 1904), later a writer and broadcaster, daughter of Ralph Hoffmann, director of the Natural History Museum at Santa Barbara. They married on 1 June 1925, and in his wife Bliss found the ideal partner who created for him a secure domestic happiness upon which his art could flourish. The couple had two daughters. Compositions from his USA sojourn include the song cycle <span class="italic">The Women of Yueh</span> (1923) and the suite for piano (1925).<br>
<br>Bliss returned to England with his wife shortly after their marriage. The two works he composed next had American links, since the <span class="italic">Introduction and Allegro</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">Hymn to Apollo</span> (1926) were conceived specifically for the Philadelphia and Boston orchestras and for their respective conductors Leopold Stokowski and Pierre Monteux. Performances by such orchestras and conductors bear witness to the reputation Bliss now commanded. In the next three major works that followed, the oboe quintet, commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge (1927), the <span class="italic">Pastoral</span> (1928), and the <span class="italic">Serenade</span> (1929), Bliss reached maturity establishing a distinctive voice in which a more overt Romantic vein comes to the fore.<br>
<br>From 1929 to 1939 Bliss lived at East Heath Lodge, Hampstead. He and his wife were in the midst of an artistic community, and friendships developed with Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Mark Gertler (whose portrait of Bliss is in the National Portrait Gallery, London), and J. B. Priestley. In 1934 they built a country house in Somerset, Pen Pits, which was designed by Peter Harland in the modern style influenced by the Bauhaus.<br>
<br>The 1930s were highly successful for Bliss. In <span class="italic">Morning Heroes</span> (1930) his war experiences and the pain of Kennard's death were translated into a profound choral symphony, in which he exorcised a horrific recurring dream of the trenches. The clarinet quintet (1932), viola sonata (1933), and <span class="italic">Music for Strings</span> (1935) showed his mastery of absolute forms. The quintet was conceived for the clarinettist Frederick Thurston, and the sonata for the viola player Lionel Tertis. Writing works for great artists such as these and collaborating with major figures in other art forms were to become hallmarks of Bliss's career. This is apparent in his next important commission: a score for Alexander Korda's film of H. G. Wells's <span class="italic">Things to Come</span> (1934&#150;5), based on his novel <span class="italic">The Shape of Things to Come</span>. It remains one of the finest scores for the medium. The music showed a natural dramatic talent that was further evident in the ballet <span class="italic">Checkmate</span> (1937), with a scenario by Bliss based on one of his lifelong enthusiasms: chess. Ninette de Valois choreographed the ballet, which had designs by E. McKnight Kauffer; it was still a classic of the Royal Ballet's repertory at the end of the twentieth century. Bliss capped the decade with the piano concerto (1939), especially written for Solomon to perform at the New York World Fair in June 1939.<br>
<br>After the premi&egrave;re Bliss and his family remained in the USA on holiday and were there when war was declared. On the advice of friends in England, Bliss initially remained in America, becoming a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. There he composed two of his most personal works, the <span class="italic">Seven American Poems</span> (1940) and the first string quartet (1941). However, even though his family remained in the USA, he increasingly felt that he must return to England to help in the war effort. This he did in 1941 when he joined the BBC overseas music service, subsequently serving as the BBC's director of music from 1942 to 1944. The far-sighted vision of his &#145;Music policy statement&#146; was influential and led to the founding of the Third Programme. Bliss and his family were reunited in November 1943. For the rest of the 1940s Bliss was occupied with theatrical projects: the ballets <span class="italic">Miracle in the Gorbals</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Adam Zero</span> (1946), which were choreographed by Robert Helpmann (who also danced the leading roles), and the opera <span class="italic">The Olympians</span> (1948&#150;9), with a libretto by J. B. Priestley. The latter was staged at Covent Garden in 1949, but did not prove a great success.<br>
<br>Bliss was knighted in 1950 and appointed master of the queen's music in 1953, a post he served diligently with distinction and which included composing the music for the investiture of the prince of Wales (1969). During his tenure Bliss was unstinting in his work for the music profession. Among many appointments he was president of the Performing Right Society (1954&#150;75), and in 1956 under the auspices of the British Council he led the first delegation by British musicians to the Soviet Union since the end of the Second World War. His outstanding public service was recognized by two further honours: KCVO (1969) and CH (1971). He received honorary degrees at Cambridge, London, and Edinburgh universities among others, and was gold medallist of the Royal Philharmonic Society (1963).<br>
<br>Several major works of the 1950s reflect again Bliss's association with great artists of the time: the second string quartet (1950), for the Griller quartet; a <i>scena</i>, <span class="italic">The Enchantress</span> (1951), for Kathleen Ferrier; the piano sonata (1952), for Noel Mewton-Wood; and the violin concerto (1955), for Alfredo Campoli. In that decade he composed too the work that he felt was perhaps his finest and most personal achievement: the orchestral <span class="italic">Meditations on a Theme by John Blow</span> (1955). This was followed by a television opera, <span class="italic">Tobias and the Angel</span> (1959&#150;60), with a libretto by Christopher Hassall. The early sixties produced three significant choral works: <span class="italic">The Beatitudes</span> (1961), commissioned for the reopening of Coventry Cathedral, and <span class="italic">Mary of Magdala</span> (1962), both of which were further collaborations with Hassall, and <span class="italic">The Golden Cantata</span> (1963), in which he set words by Kathleen Raine.<br>
<br>Bliss continued to compose vigorously into his seventies and eighties, producing the orchestral <span class="italic">Metamorphic Variations</span> (1972), the cello concerto (1970), premi&egrave;red by Mstislav Rostropovich, and a cantata, <span class="italic">Shield of Faith</span> (1974). In his early career Bliss was a prolific writer about music, and he was also a fine conductor; he conducted the premi&egrave;res of <span class="italic">A Colour Symphony</span> and <span class="italic">Morning Heroes</span>, and formed a close association with the London Symphony Orchestra, serving as its president from 1958 to 1973. His autobiography, <span class="italic">As I Remember</span> (1970; reprinted, 1990), is a fascinating description of the composer's life and music. Bliss was an outstanding speaker and conversationalist, although he was reticent about discussing his music in depth, preferring that it spoke for itself. In 1955 Sir Arthur Bliss and his wife moved to 8 The Lane, Marlborough Place, St John's Wood, London, where he died from cancer on 27 March 1975; after cremation at Golders Green on Easter Saturday 1975, his ashes were interred in Mortlake Catholic cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
