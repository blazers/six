<span class="headword">Mercer,  David Stuart</span>  (1928&#150;1980), <span class="occ">playwright and scriptwriter</span>, was born on 27 June 1928 at the Maternity Hospital, Blenheim Road, Wakefield, amid the coalfields of west Yorkshire, the younger son of Edward Mercer, a railway engine driver, and his wife, Helen Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Steadman, who had been &#145;in service&#146; before the marriage. Both of David Mercer's grandfathers were miners. Raised in a time of considerable hardship, he came from a strict and respectable upper-working-class family. His parents, who, when he was young, had left Methodism for low-church Anglicanism, were ambitious for him and his brother, Reuben; the family dictum, David recalled later, was &#145;do owt as long as tha doesn't get th'hands mucky&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatre Quarterly</span>). A childhood illness incarcerated him in plaster for a time, giving him opportunity to read, yet he failed to follow his brother to grammar school.<br>
<br>After leaving elementary school at fourteen, Mercer found work as a pathology laboratory assistant at the local hospital. Three years later, in what he subsequently described as an act of misguided patriotism, he joined the Royal Navy, and was employed there in a pathology lab. He was shore based for eighteen months, then posted to HMS <i>Vanguard</i>. Apart from treating his marine colleagues for venereal disease, Mercer spent most of his time reading escapist fiction, and he discovered then that he longed for the education he had missed. He won his release in 1948 and used his former serviceman's grant to attend Wakefield Technical College. He matriculated in a year and went on to study chemistry at University College, Durham, but he soon switched to King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne (then affiliated with the University of Durham), to study fine art; he gained a 2:2 BA honours degree in 1953. During his time at college, Mercer devoured books on poetry, politics, philosophy, history, and psychiatry.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1953, just after graduation, Mercer married his first wife, Jitka Sigmund (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), a refugee from Olomouc, Czechoslovakia, who had been studying economics at King's. He travelled to Paris to become a painter, and lived there with his wife among other &eacute;migr&eacute;s from communist regimes. On realizing that he was not cut out to be a painter, he burnt all his canvasses and turned to writing novels, all of which remained unpublished. Back in England after two years, he settled in London, earning a subsistence living as a supply teacher. In 1957 he started a relationship with Dilys Johnson, a graduate civil servant in the Ministry of Housing; his marriage collapsed, he had a nervous breakdown, and he was accepted at the pioneering Tavistock Clinic as &#145;a suitable case for treatment&#146;.<br>
<br>It was while undergoing analysis in 1959 that Mercer started writing his first play. He had begun to visualize ideas in the form of images and speeches, and when he went to see Shelagh Delaney's <span class="italic">A Taste of Honey</span> he thought he could do better. The result was <span class="italic">A Death in the Family</span>, a script that drew heavily on his own background. By the good luck of an accidentally circuitous route, the script landed on the desk of the formidable play agent Margaret (Peggy) Ramsay. Within twelve months Mercer had received commissions to write plays for radio and television, and in the following year, 1961, he gave up teaching and became a full-time playwright instead. The breakthrough, however, did not come in the theatre, as Mercer and Ramsay had intended, but in television, the dramatic output of which was barely taken seriously at the time. Mercer changed that. He became the pathfinder and opened the way for writers like Dennis Potter, creating new benchmarks for the medium through his unconventional and compelling narrative technique, his urgent treatment of ideas, and the sharpness of the interplay between the political and the personal.<br>
<br>Mercer's first television play was a revised version of <span class="italic">A Death in the Family</span>, retitled <span class="italic">Where the Difference Begins</span>. It formed the opening part of the innovative trilogy entitled <span class="italic">The Generations</span> (1961&#150;3), a typically astringent portrait of waning ideals, set in the world of the anti-nuclear movement and the cold war. In some of his television plays, however, Mercer focused more upon the individual, as in <span class="italic">A Suitable Case for Treatment</span> (1962) or <span class="italic">In Two Minds</span> (1967), works in which he explored madness, as either the only strategy for, or the personal cost of, survival.<br>
<br>Mercer's career as a playwright took off in 1965 with <span class="italic">The Governor's Lady</span>, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which was to stage six of his plays, and, in the West End, with <span class="italic">Ride a Cock Horse</span>, in which Peter O'Toole played a successful working-class writer whose sense of self is undermined by his anxiety at the way he treats the three important women in his life. Friends maintain that the first of these women was modelled on Dilys Johnson, whom Mercer had married on 3 December 1960. She had seen him through the breakdown, but found it hard to share him as his circle widened and he became a striking figure on the literary scene. His desire for abundance&#151;in money, drink, and women&#151;did not help, and the second marriage disintegrated too. A long string of relationships, including one with novelist Penelope Mortimer (1918&#150;1999) and another with a German actress, Maria Machado, with whom he had a daughter, ended only with his third and last marriage, on 5 November 1974, to Israeli speech therapist Dafna Hemdi (<i>b</i>. 1950). Their daughter, Rebecca, was born the following year. Mercer spent much of his later life in Israel. He was the inspiration behind the character of Malcolm Sloman in Trevor Griffith's play <span class="italic">The Party</span> (1973), in which the drunken working-class writer punctures the political pretensions of the assembled revolutionary sloganizers.<br>
<br>In all Mercer had two plays broadcast on radio, twenty-six plays broadcast on television, sixteen stage plays produced, and five screenplays made into films. He won three Writers' Guild awards for television scripts (<span class="italic">A Suitable Case for Treatment</span>, 1962; <span class="italic">In Two Minds</span>, 1967; <span class="italic">Let's Murder Vivaldi</span>, 1968), the 1965 <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> award for most promising dramatist (<span class="italic">Ride a Cock Horse</span>), the 1966 BAFTA award for best screenplay (<span class="italic">Morgan</span>), the French Film Academy C&eacute;sar award for <span class="italic">Providence</span> (1977), and an Emmy award in 1980 for the television play <span class="italic">A Rod of Iron</span>. The BBC wiped much of his television work (as was its custom then), but texts were published. As for his stage writing, Mercer was always frustrated by lack of recognition, despite the success of <span class="italic">After Haggerty</span> (1970), the first new play from the RSC to transfer to the West End.<br>
<br>An internationalist and anti-Stalinist Marxist who became disillusioned with the shortcomings of all his favourite causes, Mercer never stinted in asking the awkward questions. A huge bear of a man, topped by a full mop of hair and fronted by a cropped moustache and beard, he was, like his work, full of volatile contradictions: vulnerable and violent, loving and loathing. He excoriated his masculinity but could not escape it; he raged at injustice worldwide but felt powerless before the enormity of it&#151;and so he wrote his plays, which bear the stamp of his passion and his pain. David Stuart Mercer died of a heart attack on 8 August 1980 in Haifa, Israel, where he was buried, many miles from Wakefield.<br>
