<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stoneman,  Walter Ernest</span>  (1876&#150;1958), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 6 April 1876 at 9 Caprera Terrace, Plymouth, Devon, the youngest son and the thirteenth of fourteen children of Edwin Wills Stoneman (1835&#150;1883), wholesale grocer, and his wife, Eliza Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Serjeant (<i>b</i>. 1838). After studying at Plymouth College he chose not to join the family business, and decided at the age of fifteen to pursue a career in photography.<br>
<br>By the age of twenty-one Stoneman was working as a junior photographer for the large established firm of J. Russell &amp; Sons of 17 Baker Street, London. He also opened his own professional photographic firm, Heath and Stoneman Ltd, in Plymouth. One of his earliest successes for Russell &amp; Sons was an image of Queen Victoria on her diamond jubilee, 21 June 1897, riding through the crowds in her gilded horse-drawn state landau. In his lecture &#145;Subjects interesting and otherwise&#146; in December 1924 at the Croydon Camera Club, Stoneman recalled the momentous day: &#145;the firm had fourteen operators at various points on the route; ten with 12 &times; 10 cameras and four with whole plate&#146;. As a junior he was given the smaller size, but was the only operator who managed to secure four snapshots of the queen. On the same occasion he captured Field-Marshal Earl Roberts leading the procession  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, December 1924).<br>
<br>Stoneman not only photographed royalty at public events, but was also invited inside Buckingham Palace and Sandringham on several occasions for private portrait sittings with various members of the royal family, including Queen Victoria, George V, Queen Mary, Prince Albert, duke of York (later George VI), and Prince Henry, duke of Gloucester.<br>
<br>Stoneman worked his way up at the firm of J. Russell &amp; Sons, photographing society figures and distinguished Britons. By 1913, when the studio moved to new premises at 51 Baker Street, Stoneman had risen to the position of managing director. In 1914 he was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society (having become a member the previous year). On 2 October 1915, at the Baptist Church, Haven Green, Ealing, Brentford, he married Kathleen Irene (<i>b</i>. 1892), daughter of George Herbert Stoneman, jeweller. They had one son.<br>
<br>The year 1917 marked a turning point in Stoneman's professional career. He approached the director of the National Portrait Gallery, James Milner, with an ambitious idea for a national photographic record. He planned to photograph every eminent British person, with one photograph of each to be kept as a permanent record in the gallery's reference collection. James Milner was impressed by the proposal, and an initial contract was made between J. Russell &amp; Sons and the National Portrait Gallery trustees for the period from 1 May 1917 to 24 June 1918.<br>
<br>To ensure that no important figure was omitted, a list of categories of sitters was drawn up. It included peers of the realm, privy councillors, members of the House of Commons, grand commanders and knight commanders of all orders of British knighthood, members of the Order of Merit, heads of civil and diplomatic services, government ministers of state, admirals, field-marshals, generals, commanding officers of the navy and army, fellows of the Royal Society, fellows of the British Academy, members of the Royal Academy of Art, the academic committee of the Royal Society of Literature, chancellors of universities and heads of colleges. Notable early sitters for the national photographic record (NPR) included the prime ministers Arthur Balfour and Stanley Baldwin, the anthropologist William Halse Rivers, the artist Edward Poynter, and the writers J. M. Barrie and Rudyard Kipling. Additional categories were subsequently added, but the emphasis of the record remained political and military.<br>
<br>Despite the controversy caused by working exclusively with one photographer, the gallery's trustees were pleased with the results, and Stoneman continued with the record for forty-one years, adding 100&#150;200 portraits each year. Sitters received an invitation to book a portrait session with Stoneman, at no cost to themselves, at the studio of J. Russell &amp; Sons at 51 Baker Street, which was renumbered 73 Baker Street in 1920 and moved to new premises at 63 Baker Street in 1932. Stoneman produced one postcard-sized bromide print of each sitter in a cream card mount for the record. The camera he used was a large wooden apparatus, operated by a bulb, &#145;as old as I am&#146;, he once said, which produced whole- and half-plate glass negatives  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 May 1958). The photographs are a uniform set of formal head-and-shoulders studio portraits, occasionally including the sitter's hands. Kathleen Stoneman played an important role in the compilation of the NPR, finding information about sitters and arranging appointments in the studio.<br>
<br>The vast majority of NPR subjects were men, and in 1932 Stoneman decided that he would not photograph women again. He famously declared: &#145;Women do not make beautiful photographs. Men have more character in their faces. Lines come with age and character. The man does not bother about them. The woman does. She wants them obliterated, and often does this with cosmetics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>, 16 May 1958). However, he occasionally made an exception, and among the female sitters in the NPR are several politicians, including Nancy Astor (1921), Margaret Wintringham (1921), Dame Katharine Stewart-Murray, duchess of Atholl (1925), and Margaret Grace Bondfield (1930), as well as such leading figures in the arts as Myra Hess (1957) and Alice Meynell (<i>c</i>.1917).<br>
<br>Stoneman's dedication to the NPR is evident in the vast number of portraits he produced; yet he still found time for other projects and frequently lectured on photography. In 1924 he provided twenty-one author portraits for the anthology <span class="italic">Rosemary</span>, a collection of poetry and prose dedicated to the memory of those who fought in the First World War, compiled by F. de Burgh.<br>
<br>Stoneman's most iconic portrait is that of Winston Churchill standing in the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street. The photograph was not commissioned for the NPR, but was presented to the National Portrait Gallery by Stoneman who, sensing its historical significance, recorded the precise moment at which it was taken, 3 p.m. on 1 April 1941  (Rogers, 238). The image represented the power and determination of the nation, and it was circulated around the world; a copy of it stood on Stalin's desk in Moscow.<br>
<br>The NPR images were not originally intended for exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, but formed an important part of the reference collection. This did not prevent them from being displayed elsewhere. In January 1922 and December 1924 the Royal Photographic Society held exhibitions of Stoneman's photographs at their premises, 35 Russell Square. The J. Russell &amp; Sons studio also held several shows to promote Stoneman's work. In February 1931 its exhibition &#145;Famous men&#146;, at 73 Baker Street, consisted of sixty-three portraits by Stoneman including Bernard Partridge, Ernest Benn, and John Lavery. Such exhibitions boosted Stoneman's reputation and brought more clients to the bustling studio. His fee was advertised as 3 guineas in the leaflet accompanying the exhibition &#145;Men of to-day by Stoneman&#146;, at Foyle's Art Gallery, 121 Charing Cross Road, in December 1943. The price included the studio sitting, submitting proofs, finishing and two signed photographs, with further copies at 1 guinea each. His commitment to the art of portrait photography was recognized in 1948, when he was made MBE.<br>
<br>Stoneman was described as &#145;a stoutish, chin-bearded man with a twinkle behind his spectacles&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 May 1958) and as &#145;a brisk, lively little man &hellip; always immaculately dressed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian World</span>, 22 May 1958). His lifelong devotion to photography was matched by a devout Christian faith. A Congregationalist, he was a lay preacher for many years, and later in life was a member of the City Temple. With a strong attachment to his native Plymouth, he was vice-president of the London Devonian Association, as well as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Stoneman continued to work until the week of his death, commuting to London from his home, Castalia, Ringley Avenue, Horley. He died on 14 May 1958 at Horley Cottage Hospital, Surrey. During his sixty-six-year career, he captured approximately forty thousand influential Britons, including five monarchs, nine prime ministers, twelve lord chancellors, eighty admirals and one hundred generals. The NPR had not, however, been a remunerative project for him, and after his death his widow suffered financially. She nevertheless reflected that it had been &#145;a deeply satisfying work and all his thought and energy were expended on it&#151;it was indeed his life&#146;  (Kathleen Stoneman to director of the NPG, NPG archives). He was succeeded as the official photographer for the NPR by Walter Bird in 1958 and by Godfrey Argent in 1967. The record, which closed in 1970, remains an important part of the National Portrait Gallery photographs collection.<br>
