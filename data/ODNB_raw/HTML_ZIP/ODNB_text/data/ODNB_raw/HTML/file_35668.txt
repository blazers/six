<span class="headword">Randegger,  Alberto</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">music teacher and composer</span>, was born in Trieste on 13 April 1832. His father was a German schoolmaster and his mother, an amateur musician, was Tuscan. At the age of thirteen he was taught by Tivoli, of Trieste Cathedral, and then studied piano with Lafont and composition with Luigi Ricci. In 1850 he made the acquaintance of Verdi, who visited Trieste for the production of his opera <span class="italic">Stiffelio</span> (which was to become <span class="italic">Aroldo</span>), first performed on 16 November 1850. In 1852&#150;4 he conducted at several theatres in Italy and Dalmatia, composed ballets and church music, and collaborated with other pupils of Ricci in the opera buffa <span class="italic">Il lazzarone</span> (Trieste, 1852). His tragic opera <span class="italic">Bianca Capello</span> was produced at Brescia in 1854, and its success brought him an offer to conduct it in America, but he was prevented from doing this by a cholera outbreak in New York. Later that year he stayed in Paris for a month and then, at the invitation of his eldest brother, visited London. He decided to stay, and established himself as a singing teacher, conductor, and composer.<br>
<br>Randegger had never heard an oratorio, and is said to have been daunted by the huge number of performers at a performance at Exeter Hall of Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>, and the strangeness of the style soon sent him to sleep. But on the advice of Sir Michael Costa he persevered, mastered the English language, and in 1855 published his first composition set to English words, a song entitled &#145;The Meadow Gate&#146;. He took further lessons in composition in London from Bernhard Molique, and in 1857 conducted an opera season at St James's Theatre. From 1854 to 1870 he was organist at St Paul's, Regent's Park, and on the death of Prince Albert he composed an anthem performed there.<br>
<br>Randegger was most successful as a teacher of singing, and in 1868 was appointed professor of singing at the Royal Academy of Music. It has been said that his compositions were distinguished by practical qualities, were always tasteful and externally effective, but had no deep originality, and soon fell into disuse. The most notable are the comic opera <span class="italic">The Rival Beauties</span> (Leeds, 2 May 1864), dedicated to Costa, and a dramatic cantata <span class="italic">Fridolin</span> (Birmingham festival, 28 August 1873). The trio <span class="italic">I naviganti</span> (1862) was also popular. For Novello's series of primers he contributed <span class="italic">Singing</span> (1893), which had an exceptionally wide circulation. He worked at the Carl Rosa Theatre (1879&#150;85) and also at Covent Garden and Drury Lane (1887&#150;98), conducting Italian opera for Sir Augustus Harris as well as many choral concerts. He also conducted the Queen's Hall Choral Society and the first two seasons of symphony concerts at Queen's Hall (1895&#150;7), and he introduced many important novelties, mainly English, at the Norwich festival, which he conducted from 1881 to 1905 (taking over from Benedict). In addition he appeared at the Wolverhampton festival from 1868. He attended the Beethoven centenary festival in Bonn in 1870. He edited numerous collections of classical airs, including works by Handel and Mendelssohn, collaborated with T. J. H. Marzials on the libretto for Goring Thomas's <span class="italic">Esmeralda</span> (1883), actively promoted Wagner's early operas, and was admired for his interpretations of Verdi's works. Besides his extensive practice at the Royal Academy of Music he also became in 1896 a teacher at the Royal College, sharing in the management of both institutions. He was much in request as an adjudicator in competitions, including various eisteddfodau, and was an honorary member of the Philharmonic Society of Madrid. In 1892 the king of Italy made him a cavaliere. In 1897 he married Louise Nancy Baldwin of Boston, USA.<br>
<br>To the end of his life Randegger remained an indefatigable worker, and he attended the performance of new works with a score which he marked with all details of the performance. He was still actively engaged, and a familiar figure at London musical functions, in 1911, when, after a short illness, he died at his residence, 5 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, London, on 18 December; his wife survived him. He was described as a very kind man, and his memorial service, held at St Pancras Church by Canon Sheppard of the Chapel Royal on 21 December, was attended by many prominent musicians. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
