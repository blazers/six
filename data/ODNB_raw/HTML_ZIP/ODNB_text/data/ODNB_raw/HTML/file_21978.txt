<span class="headword">Perrin,  Jean Baptiste</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1767&#150;1798), <span class="occ">tutor and educational author</span>, was born in France. He travelled to Dublin, where he settled and worked as a French teacher. He taught private pupils in their own homes and was often employed for several months at a time as a resident tutor in gentry families keen to master French. In the preface to <span class="italic">La bonne m&egrave;re</span> (1786) he advertised his fees for teaching French as 2 guineas for eight lessons, plus 2 guineas for entrance or enrolment.<br>
<br>Perrin was a prolific author of educational books, particularly on the French language, nearly all of which were first published in London by the bookseller Bedwell Law. By 1770 he had five works to his name, each of which addressed different aspects of learning French, such as pronunciation, syntax, verbs, personal pronouns. His earliest work seems to have been <span class="italic">Essai sur l'origine et l'antiquit&eacute; des langues</span>, which was published anonymously in 1767. As outlined in <span class="italic">The French student's vade-mecum</span> (1770), Perrin's method promised the student rapid results, and he unashamedly advised his readers how to cut corners and thereby avoid &#145;long and constant application to the rules of syntax and practice&#146;  (preface). He astutely compiled a volume of French conversations (with a parallel translation into English) on topics that would appeal to his teenage readers, such as trips to Vauxhall Gardens, buying a lottery ticket, going to hear a fashionable preacher, shopping in London's West End, and even playing a game of cricket. Like the majority of his works <span class="italic">The elements of French conversation, with new, familiar and easy dialogues, each preceded by a suitable vocabulary in French and English</span> (1774) proved popular, and reached its twenty-first edition in 1820. An Italian edition, in which the dialogues were also translated into Italian, was published in Naples in 1814, although without the dialogues on cricket. His other publications include a French grammar, which he dedicated to Lord Lyttelton, a new edition of Louis Chambaud's French&#150;English dictionary, and a collection of moral dramas, <span class="italic">La bonne m&egrave;re</span> (1786), which he dedicated to Queen Charlotte.<br>
<br>Perrin married an Irishwoman whose maiden name was Daly and they had at least one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21979/', "Louis Perrin")</script>, a judge, who was born at Waterford in 1782. Perrin became involved in Irish patriot politics and on 26 April 1784 was elected an honorary member of the Sons of the Shamrock. He was a nationalist by the mid-1790s and apparently supported the plan to invite republican France to invade Ireland. In his later years he lived at Leinster Lodge, near Athy, co. Kildare, a house on the estate of the second duke of Leinster and formerly the home of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, who died in 1798; the house had been used for United Irish meetings leading up to the rising of 1798. It is not known when Perrin died; he was buried at the old church at Palmerstown.<br>
