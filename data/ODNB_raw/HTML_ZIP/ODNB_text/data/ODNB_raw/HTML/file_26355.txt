<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Steevens,  George</span>  (1736&#150;1800), <span class="occ">literary editor and scholar</span>, the only son of George Steevens (1701&#150;1763) and his wife, Mary Perryman, was born at Poplar, London, on 10 May 1736 and was baptized at Stepney parish church nine days later. His father, although described simply as &#145;mariner&#146; in the baptismal register, was the captain of a ship who, when he retired from active service, lived in a substantial residence at Poplar, was elected a vestryman in 1746, obtained a seat as a director of the East India Company, and died on 14 June 1763  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1763, 314). George attended a school at Kingston, Surrey, and went on to Eton College. Admitted a fellow-commoner of King's College, Cambridge, on 29 March 1753, he matriculated on 14 April and resided in college until the summer of 1756. He left university without a degree.<h2>
<a name="EditorofShakespeare"></a>Editor of Shakespeare</h2>Steevens settled in London in 1756, at first apparently in chambers in the Temple. On his father's death he inherited a competence and property in the neighbourhood of Poplar, but he soon bought a house (formerly a tavern named the Upper Flask) in Hampstead, near the summit of Hampstead Heath. For the rest of his life a cousin, Mrs Mary Collinson, and her daughters, kept house for him, and he left her &pound;300 in his will. His daily routine was to walk into London before seven in the morning, paying visits to friends, bookshops, and publishing offices, and walk back early in the afternoon to spend the rest of the day at home.<br>
<br>While it is not known exactly when Steevens met Samuel Johnson, it could have been at any time between April 1758, two years after Steevens left Cambridge and the date at which Johnson first mentioned an appendix to his edition of Shakespeare's plays, and October 1765, when the edition was published. Since Johnson lived in Inner Temple Lane from August 1760 to July 1765, and Steevens maintained chambers at least until the end of 1765, it may be that their first meeting came between those two dates. In any event Steevens added a list of the extant Shakespeare quartos to the end of volume 8 and forty-nine notes to the appendix of the 1765 edition. The fact that he added notes to the plays in volumes 1&#150;4 of the edition does not necessarily mean that his contributions were early ones. Most of his notes corrected those of previous editors, an early indication of things to come. Two days after the edition came out, Thomas Birch, in a letter to Lord Hardwicke, wrote that:<blockquote>Mr. Steevens, a Gentleman of a very considerable Fortune in the Temple, to whom the public owes the completing of Johnson's edition of Shakespeare, and without whose Assistance that Work would probably not have appear'd these twelve Months, is reprinting the old 4to Editions of that Poet's plays, with all possible Exactness, even to the Errors of the Press. (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Birth</span>, 15)</blockquote>Soon after the notes to Johnson's edition, therefore, Steevens's already advertised edition <span class="italic">Twenty of the Plays of Shakespeare &hellip; Printed in Quarto</span> (1766) was published in four volumes, bare of commentary except for textual notes where more than one quarto of a play was extant. Shakespeare's sonnets were printed without notes and the <span class="italic">Chronicle History of King Leir and his Three Daughters</span> was added.<br>
<br>The known facts of Steevens's life, other than the details of his editorial labours and the litany of his enmities and the various deceptions he practised, are few. In 1767 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. Shortly thereafter the 1773 revision of Johnson's edition of Shakespeare was published. His name was on the title-page with Johnson's, and Johnson's acknowledgement of his part in the edition was added in a paragraph to the preface:<blockquote>Of what has been performed in the revisal, an account is given in the following pages by Mr. Steevens, who might have spoken both of his own diligence and sagacity, in terms of greater self-approbation without deviating from modesty or truth.</blockquote>Steevens's account of what was performed in the revisal ran to a ten-page advertisement. He was elected to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/49211', "Club")</script>, later known as the Literary Club, in February 1774; Johnson was his sponsor. The social highlights of Steevens's life were the various annual visits in the autumn to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, with his friend Isaac Reed; there they joined Richard Farmer, master of the college, in the many activities afforded by Cambridge and some of the nearby villages. Notable among these were the plays put on by a provincial company of actors at the famous Stourbridge fair. Steevens enjoyed the theatre, when in London attending early performances before walking back to his home in Hampstead.<h2>
<a name="Hoaxesandantagonisms"></a>Hoaxes and antagonisms</h2>It is unfortunate that Steevens should be remembered for his hoaxes and for his attacks on various of his contemporaries rather than for his valuable additions to Shakespeare scholarship. But his wit and the associated learning having earned him the name of the Puck of Commentators, his puckishness&#151;a mild term&#151;must be chronicled. The earliest of his literary hoaxes was a forged letter, purportedly by George Peele, describing his meeting at the Globe Theatre with Shakespeare and other dramatists. As with his later deceptions, the letter was accepted as genuine, was enshrined in Dr John Berkenhout's <span class="italic">Biographia litteraria</span> (1777), in which he had a hand, and surfaced in the twentieth century in Sir Sidney Lee's <span class="italic">Shakespeare and the Modern Stage</span> (1906). The most elaborate of his hoaxes originated in a grudge against Richard Gough, one of the best-known antiquaries of that time&#151;author of, among other works, <span class="italic">Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain</span> (1786). Steevens had offered to exchange some books for four rare plates by Hogarth owned by Gough, so that he, Steevens, might add them to his already large collection. When Gough refused, Steevens had a block of marble engraved by aquafortis with some Anglo-Saxon words, had it placed in the window of a Southwark shop, and saw to it that his fellow members of the Society of Antiquaries were informed that it, the tombstone of Hardecanute, had been recently dug up in Kennington Lane. A drawing of the stone was made by Jacob Schnebbelie, draughtsman to the society, engraved by James Basire, and published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (1790, 217). Samuel Pegge, another fellow of the society and himself a well-known antiquary, presented a paper upon it to the society in December 1789. Unfortunately for him, Gough, and others, the hoax was revealed by Steevens himself, writing as &#145;An Antiquary&#146; and as &#145;Annius Anglicanus&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (ibid., 217&#150;18, 290&#150;92). But the stone lived on, Steevens having given it to Sir Joseph Banks, who exhibited it at his assemblies in Soho Square. Hearsay has it that Steevens often visited Sir Joseph, daily presenting him with flowers from Hampstead attached to his cane. For whatever undiscovered reasons, Steevens wrote several notes of dubious propriety, if not downright bawdy, to two Hampstead neighbours, Mr Collins and the Revd Mr Richard Amner.<br>
<br>Erasmus Darwin, physician and scholar, a figure of some standing in botanical science and the author of several botanical works including <span class="italic">The Loves of the Plants</span> (1789), was another of Steevens's victims. The <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> for December 1783  (pp. 511&#150;17) carried Steevens's description of the upas tree of Java which could kill all life within a distance of 15 to 18 miles, his source being an entirely fictitious Dutch traveller. Darwin was taken in and admitted the upas tree into his <span class="italic">Loves of the Plants</span>, from which Coleridge derived information for two notes  (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Achievements</span>, 61&#150;2). Nor did Steevens spare his friends: he produced an Eastern romance which he named &#145;The boke of the Soldan&#146; and gave it to Bishop Percy, who never questioned its authenticity. There were other minor deceptions, notable among them being a letter to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (1782, 276, 288) with two drawings by him of the non-existent poets Chedder and Turgot, thought by the Rowleians to have inspired the equally non-existent medieval poet Thomas Rowley, Chatterton's creation. Steevens was not, however, taken in by William Henry Ireland's forgery of Shakespearian manuscripts, criticizing him harshly in the pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Besides the victims of his various hoaxes, who had sufficient reason to dislike and to asperse him, Steevens made himself obnoxious to others of his contemporaries. He satirized Garrick for his part in the Shakespeare jubilee of 1769, although he was on terms of some intimacy with him at least a few years before 1765; Garrick evidently forgave him, as is clear from their subsequent correspondence, at least up to 1775. But after Garrick's death Steevens severely criticized several of his plays and especially his alteration of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, using the medium of his friend Reed's <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> (1782). He also contributed to that work a number of sarcastic remarks on Charles Macklin, Frederick Pilon, Dr Ralph Schomberg, Robert Jephson, and Miles Peter Andrews, among others. However, he did make serious and valuable contributions. He locked horns with the irascible Joseph Ritson, who published some damning criticism, aimed chiefly at Steevens's notes, in his <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on the 1778 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> in 1783, but the two were reconciled as early as 1785.<br>
<br>As with Garrick, so with Sir John Hawkins, whom Steevens helped with the history of music upon which Sir John was working and which was published in 1776. Sir John reciprocated with a few notes on Shakespeare for the appendix to the 1773 Johnson&#150;Steevens edition of Shakespeare, notes Steevens had solicited with some insistence. Steevens was accused by Laetitia Matilda Hawkins, Sir John's daughter, of theft and the attempt to seduce the wife of a friend, but these charges lack substance. In any event Sir John gave Steevens more notes on Shakespeare for the 1778 Johnson&#150;Steevens <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, despite Sir John's suspicion that Steevens had written a parody of one of the footnotes in his history of music in the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, a periodical in which Steevens at one time had a share. Steevens also criticized Sir John's life of Johnson, having taken again to the pages of the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> in 1785 before the biography was published, and to the pages of the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, edited by Reed, very soon after publication of the biography in 1787.<br>
<br>James Boswell was ambivalent in his feelings about Steevens, although he tended to adopt the prevalent view that Steevens was a disagreeable fellow, one who had seen fit to criticize his, Boswell's, <i>magnum opus</i>, the life of Johnson, just as he had also criticized Hawkins's biography of Johnson, at the same time as he insisted in print that Boswell was best qualified to write the life of Johnson. Steevens evidently had a proprietary feeling about Johnson and all that pertained to him, one that extended to the works of Shakespeare, almost surely because of his early aid in Johnson's 1765 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>. It was this latter feeling that prompted him to take critical issue with Edward Capell and Charles Jennens&#151;Capell a competent editor of Shakespeare, Jennens an eccentric who richly deserved the treatment accorded him. Steevens again availed himself of Reed's 1782 <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span>, in which both men were severely mauled. Steevens, who at one time would seem to have believed in the existence of Chatterton's medieval poet Thomas Rowley, wrote a series of fifteen anti-Rowleian letters to the editor of the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> in the first four months of 1782, the year in which the Rowleian controversy came to the boil. He thus incurred the everlasting enmity of the chief proponents of the pro-Rowleian party, Jacob Bryant, Dean Jeremiah Milles, and Dr Robert Glynn. While Steevens's friends were not legion, he was, however, on intimate terms with Johnson, Reed, Farmer, Nichols, and Thomas Tyrwhitt, with the last of whom he collaborated in an edition of the poems of Thomas Rowley (1777). Among others of his friends was Bishop Percy, with whom he was sometimes at odds, but whom he helped in an edition of Surrey's poems and those of earlier writers of blank verse. He also had an extensive acquaintance in Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="Generosity"></a>Generosity</h2>Despite the many attacks on him, from some who had no fondness for him and from those who were indifferent to him, Steevens was praised for his generosity. He helped in one way or another, often with money, one of Oliver Goldsmith's relatives, as well as Henry Fuseli, Chatterton's mother, Dr Gloster Ridley, and others. John Nichols, writing as &#145;Etonensis&#146; in the February 1800 <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>'s obituary notice of Steevens's death, stated that &#145;though he was not seen to give eleemosynary six-pences to sturdy beggars or sweepers of crossings, few persons distributed Bank-notes with more liberality&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 70, 1800, 178). And there are the many instances of his friendly assistance to the works of other scholars. Although he helped Sir John Hawkins with his history of music, he did the same for Sir John's rival, Dr Charles Burney, with his history of music. The assistance he afforded Isaac Reed in Reed's edition of Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span> (1780), in Reed's <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> (1782), and in Reed's 1803 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> was virtually enough to qualify him as co-editor of the first and third of these works. John Nichols's <span class="italic">Biographical Memoirs of William Hogarth</span> (1781), with a much enlarged edition in 1785, and a final edition in three quarto volumes (1808&#150;17), now titled <span class="italic">The Genuine Works of William Hogarth</span>, was assisted by Steevens to an extent beyond which he had assisted any of the others. His name appeared on the title-page of the edition, and Nichols was most generous in his acknowledgement of Steevens's predominant part in the work.<br>
<br>If Johnson be acceptable as judge in the case of society v. George Steevens, then the sentence would be light, possibly probation, for Steevens was guilty, to a degree, of some&#151;not all&#151;of the crimes and misdemeanours imputed to him. Johnson much relied on him, for had it not been for Steevens, Johnson's 1765 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> would surely have borne a later date, and there would almost equally surely not have been a 1773 revised edition, virtually the sole endeavour of Steevens. Steevens helped Johnson in his lives of the English poets, among other things &#145;castrating&#146; (Johnson's word) Rochester's poems, and he may have helped him with his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. He attended Johnson's morning levees, and they spent many &#145;social hours&#146; together. Johnson borrowed books from him, and they enjoyed a display of fireworks together. And Steevens was among those who visited Johnson on the day of his death. Johnson allegedly said of Steevens that &#145;he leads the life of an outlaw&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.375 and n. 3), but when Topham Beauclerk said that the unnamed Steevens was &#145;malignant&#146;, Johnson replied that he was not &#145;malignant&#146;, but &#145;mischievous&#146;. &#145;He would do no man an essential injury; he may, indeed, love to make sport of people by vexing their vanity&#146;  (ibid., 3.281). When, again conjecturally, Steevens was accused of &#145;attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in newspapers&#146;, Johnson replied, &#145;Come, come, this is not so terrible a crime; he means only to vex them a little&#146;, adding that he would not do so himself  (ibid., 4.274 and n. 7). There are no adverse remarks on Steevens in Johnson's letters.<br>
<br>Steevens died in his home at Hampstead on 22 January 1800 and was buried in the chapel of Poplar (later St Matthias's Church) beside other family members. He was unmarried, but his name had been linked by one of his contemporaries with that of the actress Frances Kemble, Mrs Siddons's youngest sister, the affair being much embroidered upon long after his death. His very considerable library, rich in rare books, was sold by the auctioneer King in May 1800, the 1943 lots (not individual titles) fetching &pound;2740 15<i>s</i>. The sale catalogue of the library, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Steevensiana</span>, includes mention of many of Steevens's manuscript remarks upon various items in the sale, now widely dispersed.<h2>
<a name="AchievementsinShakespearescholarship"></a>Achievements in Shakespeare scholarship</h2>Steevens's major achievements lie in the contributions he made to Shakespeare scholarship, to the study of early English drama, and to the study of Hogarth's work. He resurrected twenty of the Shakespeare quartos in 1766; some thirteen years later John Nichols printed, at Steevens's suggestion, <span class="italic">Six old plays on which Shakespeare founded his &#145;Measure for Measure&#146;, &#145;Comedy of Errors&#146;, &#145;Taming the Shrew&#146;, &#145;King John&#146;, &#145;Henry IV&#146; and &#145;Henry V&#146;, and &#145;King Lear&#146;</span> (1779). George Colman the elder reviewed the edition in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> for October 1779  (1st ser., 61.296&#150;9), writing that:<blockquote>The perusal of these old plays will rather serve to raise than to depreciate his [Shakespeare's] genius in the estimation of his readers, and will shew that the delicacy of his taste and the soundness of his judgment, were almost as remarkable as the richness of his fancy. (p. 296)</blockquote>The edition was obviously considered a valuable addition to the study of Shakespeare's plays.<br>
<br>By 1779 Steevens had already acquired a well-deserved reputation as an editor of Shakespeare, because of his help not only with Johnson's 1765 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> and his, Steevens's, revision of the 1773 edition, but also with the later 1778 Johnson&#150;Steevens <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, in which Johnson corrected or added to some of his earlier notes, adding but one new note. The reviewers for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> praised Steevens's efforts; almost nothing was said of Johnson. Hard on the heels of the <span class="italic">Six Old Plays</span> came Steevens's virtual co-editorship, with the anonymous Reed, of the twelve-volume edition of Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Old Plays</span> (1780). Steevens contributed 543 notes. The same year saw Edmond Malone's two-volume supplement to the 1778 <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, with its printing of seven apocryphal plays and the sonnets. In his advertisement to the edition Malone wrote:<blockquote>To the friendship to Mr. Steevens I am indebted, not only for the numerous observations that are subscribed with his name, but also for many judicious hints for the conduct of the present work by which &hellip; it has been rendered less exceptionable than it would otherwise have been. (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Achievements</span>, 7&#150;8)</blockquote>Steevens took part in the commentary on the plays, the canonical as well as the apocryphal, and on the sonnets, on the worth of the last of which he and Malone disagreed. A scant two years later Reed revised David Erskine Baker's <span class="italic">Companion to the Playhouse</span> (1764), under the title of <span class="italic">Biographica dramatica</span> (1782), to which Steevens contributed 53 notes.<br>
<br>Reed edited the so-called Johnson&#150;Steevens <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> of 1785, Steevens contributing about 440 notes, although he had earlier disclaimed any part in it. Malone's own edition of Shakespeare's works appeared in 1790; Steevens contributed relatively few notes, almost surely having begun work on his own edition, published three years later in 1793. John Boydell, a publisher of prints, projected an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays; Steevens was eventually responsible for the text and correction of the press, although the edition was not published until 1802, two years after his death. His penultimate contribution to Shakespeare scholarship came with his <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span> of 1793, in sixteen volumes, with two volumes of prolegomena, a glossarial index at the end of volume 3, and the sixteenth volume devoted to Samuel Ayscough's elaborate index to Shakespeare's plays. When Steevens died he was engaged on another edition of Shakespeare's plays. He left his notes and the completion of the edition to Reed, who wrote that the edition contained &#145;the last improvements and corrections by Mr. Steevens, by whom it was prepared for the press&#146;  (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Achievements</span>, 199). Steevens's additions to the edition were almost 1000 in number, 202 of them being new notes. The three great eighteenth-century editors of Shakespeare were, in chronological order, Steevens, Malone, and Reed. When one adds the name of Samuel Johnson, whose edition of Shakespeare's plays was to be the point of departure for the more scholarly editions of Reed and Malone, one has what is Steevens's greatest contribution to Shakespeare studies&#151;the invaluable assistance he gave to all three. Indeed Malone's first essay into Shakespeare studies came at Steevens's invitation, to help complete the 1773 Johnson&#150;Steevens <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>. He accepted, turned his back on the law as a career, and devoted himself thereafter to literature. Steevens's own contribution to Shakespeare studies was the wealth of illustrative quotations from rare works that he brought to the annotation of the plays.<br>
