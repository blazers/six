<span class="headword">Yworth,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1715), <span class="occ">distiller and chemical physician</span>, claimed to have been born in &#145;Shipham&#146;, in the Netherlands (this location has not been traced). His early life and education are obscure, but by 1690 he was practising as a chemical physician from his house at the sign of the Collegium Chymicum in Rotterdam. He later suggested that he had begun his studies in chemistry and philosophy about 1680. By June 1691 he had moved to England, residing at the Academia Spagyrica Nova, at the Blue Ball and Star, in the London suburb of Shadwell, from where he sold medicines, wrote works on distillation, and offered lessons in chemical philosophy and practice. He was married, his wife's name being Elizabeth.<br>
<br>The changed political circumstances in England following the revolution of 1688 offered fresh opportunities to Yworth, who had a fluent command of English. In particular, he was attracted by the relatively low levels of duty payable on liquor distilled from malted corn, cider, or perry, established by statute in 1690 to encourage native alternatives to French wines, whose importation had been prohibited in 1689. His earliest publications, several of which derived from his <span class="italic">A New Treatise of Artificial Wines</span>, composed while he was still resident in the Netherlands and published in 1690, discussed distillation at length, as well as exhorting English manufacturers to exploit native resources, especially metallic ores. Yworth dedicated his <span class="italic">Chymicus rationalis</span>, registered in November 1691, to Robert Boyle. Boyle's success in 1689 in bringing about the repeal of the statute, dating from the reign of Henry IV, which prohibited the multiplication of gold and silver, may also have encouraged Yworth to pursue his career in London. However, Boyle's death in December 1691 left him without the patron he had hoped for, and there is little evidence that his business prospered in its new location. Nevertheless, he was able to employ an operator, Thomas Newton, in the laboratory of his grandly titled academy.<br>
<br>At first most of Yworth's contacts in London came from among the members of the Society of Friends; although there is no record that he himself was a Quaker, it is tempting to suppose that his earliest English associates may have been from the Quaker community in Rotterdam. His first publisher, Andrew Sowle, as well as his initial collaborator, Charles Marshall, and his agent, John Spire, were all members of the society. Despite the similarity of the ingredients and titles of many of Yworth's pills and tonics to those which Marshall had published several years earlier, the two men soon fell out over their application. Yworth also quarrelled with Sowle, whom he accused of stealing his recipes. Yworth began to market his medicines through a network of small salesmen across London, sealing them with his own device to protect against imitations. Shortage of money, however, prevented him from pursuing the most elaborate of his schemes, which involved publishing a succession of his alchemical and medical treatises, guiding a reader through the arts of Paracelsus, van Helmont, and their followers, to a new understanding of the causes and treatment of disease, and a new wisdom about the nature of creation. It also sought to encourage the more complete exploitation of the mineral treasures of Great Britain, leading to new wealth as well as prolonged life.<br>
<br>Although still living from hand to mouth, Yworth was able to move his premises to King Street, Moorfields, by 1702, and publish the first of his alchemical treatises, <span class="italic">Mercury's Caducean Rod</span>, under the pseudonym Cleidophorus Mystagogus. Together with his manuscript, &#145;Processus mysterii magni philosophicus&#146;, composed between 1701 and 1702, this work revealed him to be a well-trained and wide-ranging alchemist. Heavily influenced by the writings of Joan Baptista van Helmont and George Starkey, he was familiar with a remarkable variety of alchemical authors, including Michael Sendivogius, Basil Valentine, and Timothy Willis. He introduced extended considerations of the processes of creation, the origins of matter, and the beliefs of the ancient philosophers, into his accounts of the preparation and purification of metals and compounds, in particular sal ammoniac and mercury. By 1702 his skills had come to the attention of Isaac Newton, who shared Yworth's belief that Boyle had succeeded in transmuting base metal into gold. Newton, then master of the Royal Mint, received copies of Yworth's books and manuscripts, read and annotated them, and used them as the basis for some of his own alchemical work. In return, he paid Yworth an allowance for a time, which aided Yworth in supporting his wife and their children. It is unclear how long this relationship with Newton lasted; in 1705 Yworth published a second part of his alchemical work, <span class="italic">Trifertes sagani</span>, but by then he was already living away from London, and had handed his business there over to his son, Theophrastus. In 1709 Yworth applied for a licence to practise as a physician from Woodbridge, Suffolk, where it appears he and his family had been living for some while. He kept a shop there, achieving moderate prosperity, and continued to operate as both a distiller and a chemical physician. He died in 1715, and was survived by his wife. Thereafter Theophrastus Yworth made an attempt for a time to trade in London on his father's reputation.<br>
