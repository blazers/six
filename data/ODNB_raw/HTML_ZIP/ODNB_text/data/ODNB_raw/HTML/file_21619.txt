<span class="headword">Paulet, Sir  Hugh</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1510, <em>d.</em> 1573), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21611/', "Sir Amias Paulet (c.1457&#150;1538)")</script>, and his second wife, Laura Keilway. Any relationship to the Hampshire Paulets, notably William, ultimately lord treasurer, was extremely distant, and does not seem to have affected his career. He entered the Middle Temple, of which his father was treasurer (1520&#150;21), at an unknown date. He married, about 1530, Philippa, daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard of King's Nympton, Devon.<br>
<br>Paulet was appointed to the Somerset commission of the peace as early as 1532, and in 1534 succeeded his father as steward to the bishop of Bath and Wells, retaining that post until his death, and passing it to his descendants. He was a commissioner for the <i>valor ecclesiasticus</i> for Somerset in 1535. He was knighted on 18 July 1536, the day of the dissolution of the short parliament of that year, along with Thomas Cromwell. This has led to the supposition that he was a member of that parliament (and possibly also of the Reformation Parliament in its final phase), but there is no direct evidence. He led 300 men against the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536. He became sheriff of Somerset and Dorset for 1536&#150;7. This early rise to prominence may be due to the intimacy of his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69369/', "Richard Pollard")</script>, with Cromwell. Paulet succeeded his father in April 1538, and in November of the same year purchased the manor of Sampford Peverell in Devon from the crown for &pound;1000. He was picked to inspect Somerset's coastal defences in 1539, and probably as a result became a member of the short-lived council of the west in 1539&#150;40. He was also the senior knight of the shire for Somerset in the parliament of 1539&#150;40. He was sheriff of Devon in 1541&#150;2, and of Somerset and Dorset again in 1542&#150;3 and 1547&#150;8. He distinguished himself at the siege of Boulogne by capturing the &#145;braye&#146;, a necessary preliminary to the assault on the castle, on 1 September 1544, and became treasurer of Boulogne for the first two years of the English occupation (October 1544 &#150; October 1546). His administrative duties did not preclude his leading a raid to destroy the nearby small town of Desvres in June 1545.<br>
<br>In 1547, on Henry VIII's death, Paulet was commissioned to put the west country in order against a possible invasion, and also, with Sir John Harington, to survey Calais and Boulogne. From 1547 he was on the Devon commission of the peace. In January 1549 he was sent to take charge of Thomas Seymour's house at Bromham, Wiltshire, when Seymour was accused of treason. He served as knight marshal in Lord Russell's army against the western rebels in the summer of 1549, and with Sir Peter Carew crushed the last remnant of the uprising. Curiously, in spite of the local connection, there seems no evidence that he was ever close to Protector Somerset.<br>
<br>Somerset was governor of Jersey, and on his fall Paulet was sent in November 1549 to investigate the state of the island. He dismissed Somerset's lieutenant Henry Cornish, and reported on the fortifications. No doubt it was the privy council, grateful for his services, that persuaded the bishop of Bath and Wells to grant him a ninety-nine year lease of the manor of Chard on very favourable terms in February 1550. Paulet was appointed governor of Jersey for life on 20 March 1550. As governor he continued the policy initiated by Somerset of using church revenues to modernize the fortifications. He also attempted to enforce the Reformation, and pressed for the translation of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> into French. That was not achieved until 1553, too late to take effect before the restoration of Catholicism under Queen Mary. Paulet seems to have adapted without difficulty to the new regime, and indeed appointed his conservative brother John as dean of Jersey in 1554. In contrast to Guernsey, Jersey saw no burning of heretics, although Dean Paulet tried, unsuccessfully, to assert clerical immunities against the secular authorities. Hugh Paulet did not spend all his time in Jersey. He was commissioned to settle the immigrant weavers at Glastonbury in 1551. He was recalled from Jersey urgently in 1556 as &#145;a man of great experience and credit in the west&#146; on rumours of a possible conspiracy  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 473). While in England he advised on the fortifications of Scilly, and stood by for a possible landfall by Charles V on his last voyage from the Netherlands to Spain. Outbreak of war with France sent him urgently back to Jersey in July 1557.<br>
<br>From 1559 Paulet was an absentee governor, and day-to-day responsibility passed to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21612/', "Amias Paulet (c.1532&#150;1588)")</script> as lieutenant. Hugh Paulet distrusted the French Calvinists who had taken refuge on the island, whereas Amias sympathized with them and helped them surreptitiously to introduce a presbyterian system of church government. Hugh became, briefly, vice-president of the council in the marches of Wales in April 1559 with his usual troubleshooting brief, resulting in far-reaching proposals for reform. In June 1562 he was nominated for a commission to investigate Irish revenues, but a more urgent matter intervened, the ill-fated English occupation of Le Havre. In December 1562 he was sent to join the commander, the earl of Warwick, as his special adviser, in effect, it would seem, to try to prevent looming disaster. But in July 1563 Paulet helped negotiate the surrender, when, as he had forecast, desertion by the queen's Huguenot allies, coupled with an outbreak of plague, made the situation untenable.<br>
<br>Paulet spent his remaining years largely at Hinton St George, Somerset. His first wife, Philippa, died at an unascertained date. He had with her three sons, Amias, George, and Nicholas, and two daughters, Jane (who married Christopher Copplestone), and Anne. About the end of 1560 he married Elizabeth Blount, the rich widow of Sir Thomas Pope, designated after Pope's death as founder of Trinity College, Oxford. There were no children of this marriage. In 1562 Paulet added the Dorset commission of the peace to those for Somerset and Devon, and was also appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> for the Somerset bench. In 1571 he and Sir Maurice Berkeley were instructed by the privy council to see that suitable MPs were returned for Somerset. He was returned as a member for the county for the parliament of 1572 in which he served on several committees, most notably that on Mary, queen of Scots. He died on 6 December 1573, at Hinton St George, and was buried in the tomb he had already erected for himself and his first wife in the parish church (along with an almost identical tomb for his parents). His will, drawn up five days before his death, was largely concerned with seeing that his widow's marriage settlement was properly carried out, and with disclaiming any liability on his estate for the debts of Sir Thomas Pope or for debts arising from his service in Jersey; he claimed, indeed, to be still &pound;1000 out of pocket over the Jersey fortifications. After his death his widow was to reveal herself a committed Catholic. She died on 27 October 1593 at Tittenhanger in Staffordshire, and was buried with Pope in Trinity College chapel.<br>
