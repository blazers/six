<span class="headword">Tod,  Marcus Niebuhr</span>  (1878&#150;1974), <span class="occ">ancient historian and epigraphist</span>, was born at The Park, Highgate, Middlesex, on 24 November 1878, the second son of John Tod, a tea merchant originally from Leith in Scotland, and his wife, Gertrude von Niebuhr. His maternal grandfather was Marcus von Niebuhr, the son of the historian B. G. Niebuhr. Brought up in a strongly Presbyterian family, he was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London (1892&#150;7), where he concentrated on Greek and Latin, and went up to St John's College, Oxford, with a scholarship in 1897. He emerges in his long correspondence with his elder brother, James, as intensely competitive, both at school in a manner typical of the way public school boys were expected to behave, and at Oxford. Firsts in classical moderations (1899) and Greats (1901)&#151;the latter, he was told, the best first of his year&#151;were followed by the award of a senior studentship at the British School of Archaeology at Athens, where he spent the next four years (1901&#150;5), together with a senior scholarship at St John's, and the university's Craven travelling scholarship. It is not known whether he applied for the studentship at Athens as the result of any particular influence in his undergraduate teaching, but he would have heard lectures by H. F. Pelham, who had played a major part in the foundation of the British School at Athens and was during Tod's undergraduate career engaged in promoting the foundation of the British School at Rome.<br>
<br>Tod was elected to a fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1903 but was granted leave to remain in Greece. After returning to England in 1905 he became tutor in ancient history at the college. Among his pupils was his younger sister, Constance, who was reading Greats at Somerville College, and through her he met Mabel Bowker Byrom (1887&#150;1973), daughter of George F. Byrom, a cotton mill owner of Manchester. They were married on 8 September 1909 and had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Tod's early research was mostly on the inscriptions of Sparta, an interest retained throughout his career. In 1907 he was appointed university lecturer in Greek epigraphy at Oxford (becoming reader in 1927), his wider interest in Greek epigraphy emerging in his <span class="italic">Greek International Arbitration</span> (1913), the chapter on clubs and societies in his <span class="italic">Sidelights on Greek History</span> (1932), and in his lectures at Oxford on Greek dramatic performances.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War, Tod worked initially for the Ministry of Labour in Oxford. In the autumn of 1915 he worked with the YMCA on the western front, where he found that the troops did not share his own strong religious commitment. It was characteristic of his eirenic and generous nature that he collected published material to be given to German and Austrian scholars after the war was over. From November 1915 to January 1918 and from March 1918 to February 1919 he was in Salonika, first as an interpreter and then as a captain in the intelligence corps decoding ciphers, for which his training in epigraphy equipped him well. He was mentioned in dispatches three times, was awarded the Croix de Guerre, and was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>On his return to Oxford, Tod settled into the standard mix of lecturing, tutorials, and administrative duties for university and college, serving as secretary to the royal commission, and as vice-principal of Oriel from 1934 to 1945. At least one of his pupils remembered his tutorials as rarely responding to the essay which had been read, but as consisting of a lecture on the topic set, which was the same for everyone.<br>
<br>Tod was best known for the two volumes of <span class="italic">Greek Historical Inscriptions</span>, which superseded the <span class="italic">Manual of Greek Historical Inscriptions</span> edited by E. L. Hicks. The first volume, extending to the end of the fifth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, was published in 1933, the second, covering the fourth century, appearing in 1948. They were dedicated to Adolf Wilhelm, whose lectures on Greek epigraphy Tod had attended while a student in Athens, the lectures being conducted in the Epigraphical Museum, in front of the stones. In 1903 he had expressed a desire to participate in R. C. Bosanquet's scheme for excavation in Laconia; digging was to take place only as an adjunct to &#145;exploration&#146;&#151;what would later be called archaeological survey. Despite the advanced nature of these ideas, in his later work Tod treated &#145;historical&#146; inscriptions as those illuminating the great cruces of Greek history defined by the literary tradition. His annotations in his own copy of Dittenberger's <span class="italic">Sylloge inscriptionum Graecarum</span> are bibliographical, without noting either corrections to the text or material relevant to its interpretation; many of his publications were indeed bibliographical in nature. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1929; it is hard to think that a record such as his up to that date would have led to election in later periods. His meticulousness and eye for detail underlay his work on Greek numerical systems and coin denominations, as it did the generosity with which he read, commented on, and contributed to the work of others.<br>
<br>When Tod retired in 1947 honorary fellowships were conferred on him by Oriel and St John's colleges. He settled in Birmingham, and died on 21 February 1974 in Sheldon Hospital, Rubery, his wife having predeceased him in the previous year.<br>
