<span class="headword">Seiber,  M&aacute;ty&aacute;s Gy&ouml;rgy</span>  (1905&#150;1960), <span class="occ">composer and teacher of music</span>, was born on 4 May 1905 to a musical family in Budapest; his father, Michael Seiber, was a civil engineer, and his mother a piano teacher. In his teens he studied the cello at the Budapest Academy of Music with Adolf Shiffer and composition there with Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly&#151;who was later to defend publicly the music of his young pupil&#151;as, indeed, did B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. In his early twenties Seiber was based in Frankfurt am Main, where he started his teaching career and took a class in jazz, the first of its kind, at the Hoch Conservatorium; he also conducted in musical theatres and was cellist of the Lenjewski quartet. At one stage he joined a ship's orchestra as a cellist. With the advent of Hitler, Seiber left Frankfurt in the autumn of 1933 and returned to Budapest; he visited Russia, but went in 1935 to England, where he was to live for the rest of his life. On 12 April 1946 he married a dancing teacher, Lilla Levy (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), daughter of Emil Bauer, an architect, and they had a daughter. In 1948 he settled in Caterham, Surrey.<br>
<br>The freelance pattern of Seiber's various activities continued in England. He wrote a ten-volume accordion tutor; he lectured on jazz; and he composed music for cartoon films. In 1942 his central involvement with the English musical scene began when Michael Tippett invited him to teach at Morley College, London; this distinguished and lively evening institute became the focus of his activities for the next fifteen years. He created and directed the Dorian Singers during this time. The premi&egrave;re by the Morley College choir and orchestra of Seiber's cantata <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> in 1949 was not only to make his own name widely known, but it gave the first taste for many English audiences of continental modernism. He remained in closer touch with continental musical life than most of his English contemporaries. He attended the international Bart&oacute;k festival at Budapest in 1948, and frequently thereafter went abroad for the festivals of the International Society for Contemporary Music, which often included performances of his own music. On a visit to Budapest just before the 1956 uprising he met and befriended the young Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti, whose <span class="italic">Atmosph&egrave;res</span> (1961) is dedicated to Seiber's memory.<br>
<br>In 1943 Seiber had helped Francis Chagrin to found the Committee (later Society) for the Promotion of New Music, which was to assist in moulding and encouraging a whole generation of young English composers. After the war he became the best-known&#151;and undoubtedly the best&#151;teacher of composition in England: his pupils included Peter Racine Fricker, Don Banks, Anthony Milner, Ingvar Lidholm, Peter Schat, Hugh Wood, and Anthony Gilbert. His teaching (to quote his own words about Kod&aacute;ly) had &#145;that curiously compulsive and suggestive power of drawing out from his pupils all their latent ability&#146;  (Wood, 110). He would strengthen a pupil's musical logic by continually asking &#145;why?&#146;, and enrich both his culture and technique by referring to a very wide range of music past and present.<br>
<br>Seiber's own music covered a wide range. He wrote a popular song in 1956 which not only was successful but won an award; he wrote film music and incidental music to radio plays; and, on the other hand, he wrote chamber, orchestral, and choral music of high calibre and permanent worth. His lifelong studies in folk-song, his interest in jazz, the abiding influence of his teacher Kod&aacute;ly were all meaningful elements in a mature style which owed much to the absorption and successful synthesis of Bart&oacute;k and Arnold Schoenberg: his second string quartet and, in particular, his happily Bergian third string quartet bear eloquent witness of this. His small output of orchestral music is mainly for various solo instruments and orchestra: all of it is marked by the high standards of craftsmanship which his music invariably possessed.<br>
<br>Seiber's cantata <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> is quite rightly his best-known and most widely admired work; his poetic response to James Joyce's marvellous text, his sure feeling (gained through much practical experience) for choral writing, and a gift for glitteringly effective orchestration are here masterfully combined. A later Joyce setting, <span class="italic">Three Fragments</span> (using a text from <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>), is one of a late group of works in which he turned to stricter, more individual methods of organization. Outstanding among these are two works for violin and piano: the powerful <span class="italic">Concert Piece</span> of 1954 and the violin sonata of 1960. This fine work proved to be his last, and over it hangs the question mark posed by the untimely death of any creative artist. In 1960 Seiber was invited to lecture to South African universities, and it was during this visit that he was killed in a car crash in the Kruger National Park on 24 September.<br>
