<span class="headword">Sennett,  (Alice) Maud Mary  Arncliffe</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>(Alice) Maud Mary Sparagnapane]</span>  (1862&#150;1936), <span class="occ">women's suffrage activist</span>, was born on 4 February 1862 at 142 Bishopsgate Street Without, London, the elder daughter of Gaudente Sparagnapane (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;1877), an Italian immigrant wholesale confectioner, and his wife, Aurelia Williams (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1915). Nothing is known of her education. Of striking, dark appearance, she became an actress, using the stage name Mary Kingsley. She played at theatres throughout England and Scotland and, for a year, in Australia. She married Henry Robert Arncliffe Sennett (1863/4&#150;1944) at the church of Holy Trinity, St Giles, London, on 9 July 1898, put the stage behind her, and, with her husband, ran her family firm of &#145;G. Sparagnapane &amp; Co., The Oldest Established Manufacturers of Christmas Crackers and Wedding Cake Ornaments&#146;, which had its premises on the borders of Clerkenwell and the City. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1906 Maud Arncliffe Sennett became interested in the women's suffrage movement which, for the next fifteen years, dominated her life. Between 1906 and 1913 she belonged, both consecutively and in parallel, to the constitutional and militant wings of the movement, being at some time a member of the constitutional London Society for Women's Suffrage as well as a member of the executive committees of the Women's Freedom League, the Hampstead branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), and the Actresses' Franchise League. Her experience as an actress made her a most effective speaker; she did not undervalue her own worth in this respect. In November 1911 she was found guilty of using threatening behaviour after breaking a window in the office of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, protesting against the paper's policy of ignoring the fund-raising success of the WSPU. At her trial she is reported as saying:<blockquote>I am an employee of male labour, and the men who earn their living through the power of my poor brain, the men whose children I pay to educate, whose members of Parliament I pay for, and to whose old-age pensions I contribute&#151;these are allowed a vote, while I am voteless. (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 24 Nov 1911, 126)</blockquote>Her subsequent fine was paid by Lord Northcliffe.<br>
<br>In 1913, inspired by the spectacle and emotion surrounding the funeral of Emily Wilding Davison and encouraged by Alexander Orr, an Edinburgh businessman she met there, who felt that men were keen to press for women's suffrage, Maud Arncliffe Sennett founded the Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage (NMF). It was composed mainly of Scottish councillors and baillies, and she determined to send, in support of women's suffrage, a deputation of these worthies to Prime Minister Asquith, who was equally determined not to receive them. The NMF did, however, receive considerable press coverage and continued its campaign, generously funded by Maud Arncliffe Sennett, during the First World War. She, in turn, was accorded a singular deference by the members of the NMF, who were referred to as her &#145;bairns&#146;. In 1916 she wrote a <span class="italic">Manifesto on Venereal Disease</span> and for the remainder of the war campaigned vigorously against the <span class="roman">Contagious Disease Acts</span> that were included in the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>. With the granting of a limited measure of enfranchisement to women in 1918 support for the NMF dwindled, despite Maud Arncliffe Sennett's renaming it the Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage and Land Reform and drafting a &#145;Land Charter&#146;. Although she kept in touch with some of her fellow suffragists, in the ensuing years she does not appear to have been involved in the continuing feminist campaigns but to have devoted her energies to her new foundation, the Midhurst&#150;Haselmere Anti-Vivisection Society. She died from tuberculosis on 15 September 1936 at her home, Eversheds, Midhurst, Sussex. Her devoted husband then arranged the publication of her autobiography and gave to the British Museum the scrapbooks she had compiled during the suffrage campaign, thereby ensuring her the measure of immortality that she undoubtedly desired. In 1937 he married Johanna Olsen (<i>d</i>. 1939).<br>
