<span class="headword">Wallace,  James</span>  (<em>b. </em>1684), <span class="occ">botanist and writer</span>, was the eldest son of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28534/', "James Wallace (d. 1688)")</script>, minister of Kirkwall, Orkney, and his wife, Elizabeth Cuthbert (<i>d</i>. 1685). He gained the degree of MD&#151;probably from Edinburgh University as his father held a great admiration for Sir Robert Sibbald, who taught medicine there. His father died in September 1688 leaving his book <span class="italic">A Description of the Isles of Orkney</span> unpublished, and Wallace brought it out in Edinburgh in 1693, later adding to it a chapter on the shells and plants of the islands. This edition was dedicated to Sir Robert Sibbald, who is thought to have contributed an essay entitled &#145;The Thule of the ancients&#146;. In 1700 Wallace brought out a new edition of the book dedicated to the ninth earl of Dorset&#151;a man of some learning&#151;but without making it clear that he was not himself the author.<br>
<br>Wallace took part in the first voyage of the Darien scheme, the attempt by &#145;the Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies&#146;, the Scottish rival to the East India Company, to found a colony in the isthmus of Panama. He sailed in the <i>Endeavour</i>, which left Leith on 19 July 1698. The diary that he kept on the journey, now in the possession of the Royal Society of London, is the only source of information for the first six weeks of the expedition, to Madeira. In Darien he was impressed by the range of animal and vegetable life, particularly by what he described as &#145;the legion of monstrous plants&#146;  (Wallace, &#145;Journal&#146;), from which he collected some samples. He also noted species similar to those of Europe. The limited amount of shipping space meant that he could not bring back to Britain any large species, but he collected some leaves and ferns. Following the <i>Endeavour</i>'s sinking he returned to Scotland in December 1699 with the other survivors of the expedition in the company's remaining ship, the <i>Caledonia</i>. Wallace gave some botanic specimens to James Petiver, the demonstrator at Chelsea Physic Garden, and three of these found their way into the Sloane herbarium, the great reference collection in London. Wallace was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He had connections in London, and is said to have been in the employment of the East India Company.<br>
<br>In 1724 Wallace published in Dublin <span class="italic">The History of the Kingdom of Scotland from Fergus the First King to the Union</span>, taking kingship back to 330 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. The work is mostly derivative, following a line of descent from the imaginary early kings listed by Hector Boece and accepted by George Buchanan. Wallace diverged from Buchanan's hostility to Mary, queen of Scots, because of a strong belief in monarchy: &#145;kings derive their power from God alone&#146;, he asserted  (Wallace, <span class="italic">The History of the Kingdom of Scotland</span>, introduction). His mastery of history, even when he was not misled by Boece, was not great; there appears to be some confusion between the covenant and the solemn league and covenant. He went beyond the nominal limiting date of his work by including an &#145;impartial&#146; account of the Jacobite rising of 1715, which he presented as a letter from some Scottish gentleman to a friend in New England. He was scornful of the military performance of both sides at Sheriffmuir, claiming that the encounter should not be referred to as a battle. His concern in the rising as a whole is with the various members of the aristocracy who participated in it. Nothing is known of Wallace after the publication of the <span class="italic">History</span>.<br>
