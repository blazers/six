<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowen <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Cameron]</span>,  Elizabeth Dorothea Cole</span>  (1899&#150;1973), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 7 June 1899 at 15 Herbert Place, Dublin, the only child of Henry Charles Cole Bowen (1862&#150;1930), barrister, of Bowen's Court, Kildorrery, co. Cork, and his wife, Florence Isabella Pomeroy (<i>c</i>.1866&#150;1912), daughter of Henry Fitz-George Colley, of Mount Temple, Dublin. The Bowens were Cromwellian settlers of Welsh origin. Elizabeth Bowen's early childhood was happy, with summers spent at Bowen's Court, the house built by Henry Bowen in 1775 (the history of which she told in her family memoir <span class="italic">Bowen's Court</span>, 1964), and winters in Dublin (recalled in <span class="italic">Seven Winters</span>, 1942). This idyll ended when her father suffered a mental breakdown in 1905. &#145;Bitha&#146;, as she was nicknamed by the family, and her mother moved to England in 1906, settling in Hythe. Her marked stammer developed at this time. In 1912 her beloved mother died of cancer. Elizabeth Bowen never fully recovered from this trauma, telling a friend that the worst event of her life had occurred when she was thirteen&#151;her fiction abounds in orphaned children. Elizabeth Bowen was largely brought up by her aunts; she attended schools in Hertfordshire and Kent and spent her summers at Bowen's Court. In 1918 her father married Mary Gwynn, sister of Stephen Gwynn.<br>
<br>In 1921 Elizabeth Bowen was briefly engaged to John Anderson, a British officer, and on 4 August 1923 she married Alan Charles Cameron (1893&#150;1952), assistant secretary for education for Northamptonshire. Cameron had fought in the First World War, been badly gassed, and had been awarded the MC. Although the marriage was important to both partners, it was unconsummated. Elizabeth Bowen later told Iris Murdoch that they had decided not to have children because of her desire to write and her husband's horror of the modern world: she came to regret this decision. Alan Cameron is recalled as a Blimpish figure, given to clich&eacute;s and banal comments. However, he had a passion for education and was an enthusiast for cinema; his report <span class="italic">The Film in National Life</span> (1932) led to the founding of the British Film Institute. He gave Elizabeth Bowen practical support and was an unqualified admirer of her work&#151;he could recite long passages from her novels, which he knew almost by heart.<br>
<br>Cameron transformed Elizabeth Bowen from a <i>farouche</i>, badly dressed young woman into a more worldly, stylish figure. After their move to Waldencote, Old Headington, in 1925, on Cameron's appointment as secretary for education for Oxford, she embraced Oxford life, becoming a close friend of David Cecil, Maurice Bowra, and of Susan and John Buchan. Her first collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Encounters</span>, was published in 1923; her first novel, <span class="italic">The Hotel</span>, was published in 1927. Her first &#145;Irish&#146; novel, <span class="italic">The Last September</span>, was published in 1929; <span class="italic">Friends and Relations</span> and <span class="italic">To the North</span> followed in 1931 and 1932.<br>
<br>In early 1933 Elizabeth Bowen met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34012/', "Humphry House (1908&#150;1955)")</script>, later an eminent Dickens scholar. He had been fellow and chaplain at Wadham, but had resigned after losing his faith. Elizabeth Bowen fell in love with the brilliant, saturnine, much younger House. He was genuinely attached to her, but also admitted to being &#145;avid for experience&#146;  (House to Bowen, undated). Their affair paralleled his established relationship with Madeline Church and continued after his marriage in December 1933&#151;the wedding was arranged while Elizabeth Bowen was in New York, from early November to mid-December 1933. Elizabeth Bowen's animosity towards Madeline House expressed itself in a determination to see Humphry House as &#145;embracing mediocrity with his eyes open&#146;  (Bowen to Berlin, 18 Dec 1933) and as destroyed by claustrophobic domesticity. She expressed outrage to Humphry House on hearing of his wife's pregnancy&#151;he countered by enquiring, &#145;why, Elizabeth, did you not tell me when we first slept together that you were a virgin?&#146;  (House to Bowen, 23 July 1934). Despite these tensions Madeline House and her baby daughter stayed with Elizabeth Bowen at Waldencote in spring 1935. Early in 1936 House went to Calcutta, and this decision caused a serious quarrel with Elizabeth Bowen, although they were to remain friends. A version of this relationship&#151;radically adjusted&#151;is to be found in <span class="italic">The House in Paris</span> (1935), a novel in which Elizabeth Bowen enshrines her lover's name, and in which her quasi-obsessive theme of orphaned children is intricately tied to a secret affair. In 1935 Alan Cameron was appointed secretary to the Central Council for Schools Broadcasting. Elizabeth Bowen established herself as a notable London literary hostess at 2 Clarence Terrace, the grand house near Regent's Park which they acquired on an eight-year lease. Despite Cameron's director-level salary, they let a bed-sitting-room to help with the rent.<br>
<br>In summer 1936 Elizabeth Bowen arranged a large house party at Bowen's Court, which she had inherited on her father's death in 1930; guests included Isaiah Berlin, Rosamond Lehmann, and Goronwy Rees, journalist, Soviet agent, and fellow of All Souls. It is probable that Elizabeth Bowen saw Rees, a vital young man, as a replacement for Humphry House; however he and Rosamond Lehmann fell in love and began an affair. Elizabeth Bowen's anger at Rees's preference for the exotically beautiful Lehmann erupted in letters to Berlin, in which she accused the couple of defiling Bowen's Court by the &#145;ruthless incontinence&#146; of their actions  (Bowen to Berlin, 23 Sept 1936). Berlin thought her mad with jealousy. The enduring pain caused by this episode provided the central situation for her novel <span class="italic">The Death of the Heart</span> (1938), in which Rees was, to his consternation, transformed into the egocentric, self-destructive Eddie. Elizabeth Bowen had an intolerance of rejection and this crisis revived her resentment of Humphry House&#151;as she put it &#145;experience means nothing till it repeats itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Death of the Heart</span>, 342). Her uncontrolled behaviour is in contrast to the formal control of the novel&#151;a moving depiction of the crisis of adolescence. She had already confessed to her inability to surrender the &#145;unchecked power&#146; of the novelist and to realize &#145;that a close relationship with a person isn't a book&#146;  (Bowen to House, 6 June 1934?). As she admitted, &#145;I am fully intelligent only when I write&#146;  (<span class="italic">Why do I Write?</span>, 20).<br>
<br>Hostility to a married couple with children resurfaced in her affair with Sean O'Faolain (1900&#150;1991), which began in May 1937. Elizabeth Bowen told the American writer May Sarton that the O'Faolain marriage had been a mistake. O'Faolain, a former member of the IRA, brought Elizabeth Bowen to a closer understanding of Irish nationalist politics&#151;she had already dealt with the war of independence in <span class="italic">The Last September</span>&#151;and put her in touch with contemporary Irish writing. Their affair was effectively ended by the outbreak of war. Elizabeth Bowen also had a brief affair with May Sarton in late May 1937, which she took lightly. She told Sarton that she had had one previous affair with a woman. She distinguished between such relationships between an older woman and younger woman, and lesbianism&#151;of which she disapproved. An important literary friendship with Virginia Woolf was forged in the 1930s; Elizabeth Bowen greatly admired Woolf and valued her rigorous criticism. She stayed regularly with Woolf at Monks House, Sussex, the last time in February 1941.<br>
<br>The Second World War produced Elizabeth Bowen's greatest writing&#151;a great number of short stories emerged, many directly or indirectly concerned with the irruption of the supernatural in wartime London (&#145;The Demon Lover&#146;, &#145;The Happy Autumn Fields&#146;, &#145;Mysterious K&ocirc;r&#146;). She recalled:<blockquote>It seems to me that &hellip; the overcharged subconsciousnesses of everyone overflowed and merged &hellip; Sometimes I hardly knew where I stopped and somebody else began. The violent destruction of solid things &hellip; left all of us, equally heady and disembodied. Walls went down. (<span class="italic">The Demon Lover and other Stories</span>, 217&#150;18)</blockquote>During the war, Elizabeth Bowen travelled regularly to Ireland and wrote confidential reports for the Ministry of Information; these are brilliant exercises in reportage and analysis, which capture the constriction of neutral Ireland. Despite her own conservative political stance and patriotism&#151;she and her husband acted as ARP wardens during the war&#151;she vigorously defended Irish neutrality:<blockquote>It may be felt in England that Eire is making a fetish of her neutrality. But this assertion of her neutrality is Eire's first <i>free</i> self-assertion &hellip; Eire (and I think rightly) sees her neutrality as positive, not merely negative. She has invested her self-respect in it. (FO 800/310/253)</blockquote>Elizabeth Bowen's wartime affair with the Canadian diplomat Charles Stewart Almon Ritchie (1906&#150;1995) was the happiest and most equal sexual relationship of her life&#151;it is clear from Ritchie's diaries that he admired and loved her. The affair led to an enduring friendship and he is remembered in her will. Ritchie, who shared Elizabeth Bowen's fascination with the psychology of defeatism, is the unexpected model for Robert, the crypto-Nazi, in <span class="italic">The Heat of the Day</span> (1949), her supreme achievement as a novelist, and one of the finest novels of civilian life of the Second World War. The love affair between Robert and Stella takes place in a London rendered phantasmagoric by war, a city in which the &#145;wall between the living and the living became less solid as the wall between the living and the dead thinned&#146;  (p. 87). The novel's dreamlike Irish episodes shadow Elizabeth Bowen's war reports and depict a world of fuel shortages, isolation, and obsession with the war.<br>
<br>From 1949 to 1951 Elizabeth Bowen served on the royal commission on capital punishment and successfully pressed the case for verbal provocation. In 1945 Alan Cameron had retired from the BBC&#151;his eyesight was failing and in 1952 they moved permanently to Bowen's Court. Alan Cameron died there that August. He had functioned as a family system for Elizabeth Bowen and she was devastated by his death, using images of amputation to describe her feelings; she later told Iris Murdoch that the most terrible moment of her life had been when she found him dead and told Isaiah Berlin that she had never known what it was like to mourn before and that he had been &#145;my father and mother &hellip; I now have &hellip; &#147;no next of kin&#148; &hellip; my next of kin is this house&#146;  (Bowen to Berlin, 8 Oct 1952).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Bowen continued to entertain at Bowen's Court; guests included Iris Murdoch, a lifelong friend, and, less happily, an infatuated Carson McCullers. Despite heroic efforts, much journalism, lecture tours in the United States, and periods as writer-in-residence at American universities, Elizabeth Bowen was unable to keep up the house, which she sold in 1959 to a farmer, who promptly demolished it. She described this catastrophe as &#145;a clean end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bowen's Court</span>, 459), for she had already depicted the more typical fate of a big house&#151;degeneration&#151;in <span class="italic">A World of Love</span> (1955), her last &#145;Irish&#146; novel. Elizabeth Bowen returned to England in 1960, living first in Old Headington, and then in 1965 moving to Hythe, where she wrote her last novel, <span class="italic">Eva Trout, or, Changing Scenes</span> (1968), which reanimates the tensions of her affair with Humphry House. Its genesis was linked to the publication in 1965, of Madeline House's first volume of Dickens's <span class="italic">Letters</span>, dedicated to Humphry House, who had died in 1955: an episode of <span class="italic">Eva Trout</span> takes place in Bleak House, Broadstairs, and his letters are quoted at length. In this novel Elizabeth Bowen returns to obsessive themes&#151;displaced, orphaned, and abducted children, the disruption of a marriage by an outsider&#151;in a bizarre, kaleidoscopic work, which gives the reader a &#145;sense of burning one's finger with the present&#146;  (John Bayley to Elizabeth Bowen, undated).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Bowen's output was considerable: ten novels, over eighty short stories, as well as memoirs, travel literature, criticism, and much literary journalism. Her major novels enjoyed critical and commercial success: <span class="italic">The Heat of the Day</span> sold 45,000 copies on first publication. She was appointed CBE in 1948 and CLitt in 1965. She was a member of the Irish Academy of Letters and received an honorary DLitt from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1949 and Oxford in 1956. Elizabeth Bowen's reputation declined before her death but recently her distinction has been recognized and her standing as a writer is assured. Elizabeth Bowen was tall, large-boned, with red-gold hair and light blue eyes. Attitudes to her varied; some found her kind, generous, and unsnobbish, others thought her arrogant and condescending in a very Anglo-Irish way. In 1972 she developed lung cancer&#151;she was a sixty-a-day smoker&#151;and died on 22 February 1973 in University College Hospital, London. She is buried, as her will directed, in her husband's grave in St Colman's churchyard, Farahy, co. Cork. Virginia Woolf's final pronouncement on Elizabeth Bowen might serve as epitaph for both woman and writer; &#145;A very honourable horsefaced, upper class hard constricted mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 299).<br>
