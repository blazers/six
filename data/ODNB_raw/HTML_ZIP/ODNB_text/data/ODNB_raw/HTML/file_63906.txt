<span class="headword">Mountford family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1370&#150;1495), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, of late medieval Warwickshire, was descended from Sir John Mountford, an illegitimate son of Peter, third Baron Montfort of Beaudesert, Warwickshire, who died <i>c</i>.1369 without any direct legitimate heirs, and Laura Ullenhall. To the four manors his father diverted to him from the legitimate line Sir John was able to add another three by his marriage to Joan, heir of Clinton of Coleshill. This large and valuable north Warwickshire manor became the centre of an estate located primarily in that region. John's son, <a name="cosubject_63904"></a><span class="headword">Baldwin Mountford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1386)<span class="occ"></span>, married Margaret, daughter of a neighbour, John, Baron Clinton of Maxstoke. By 1384 he was in the service of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, the lord of Kenilworth in central Warwickshire, and he died in Spain on Gaunt's service. The early death, about 1394, of his elder son, John, meant that his effective heir was his second son, <a name="cosubject_63905"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Mountford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1452)<span class="occ"></span>. Both sons were in turn under the guardianship of Richard II's henchman William Bagot but William seems to have avoided his guardian's difficulties in 1399 and by 1407 had made the marriage that took the family into the front rank of the Warwickshire gentry and brought the last of their major land acquisitions. This match, with Margaret, sole heir of Sir John Peche, brought him a further ten Warwickshire manors, mostly in the central and south-eastern parts of the county, and made him its single greatest gentry landowner, worth at least &pound;300 a year in 1417. But even more important in making the family exceptionally influential in Warwickshire was the fact that, unusually, most of its lands were concentrated in this county.<br>
<br>William's early career, however, was marked by a certain amount of unruliness and some difficulties in securing his inheritance. Notably, he became engaged in prolonged litigation for parts of the Montfort of Beaudesert estate, a dispute that came to a head under Henry V. That it was resolved in 1417 by compromise was due largely to the firm national control of Henry V and local control of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick. The Mountfords had already had some more tenuous links with the earls but, after an earlier association with William, Lord Astley, of Astley in north Warwickshire, William Mountford became Beauchamp's close associate. He served in his retinue in France in 1415 and again in 1417&#150;21 (he was knighted during this campaign), 1421&#150;2, 1430&#150;31, and 1437&#150;9. At home he was said to be the earl's &#145;chief counsellor&#146;, receiving the large annuity of 40 marks, and was one of the pivotal figures in the powerful network focused on Beauchamp that knitted Warwickshire together during this period. His links with Beauchamp account for his offices in the county, the first of the family to be consistently among the official &eacute;lite. He held all the major local offices and was appointed the earl's deputy in his Worcestershire shrievalty. During this period he was able to establish his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_63906"></a><span class="headword">Sir Baldwin Mountford</span>  (<em>c.</em>1412&#150;1474/5)<span class="occ"></span>, at the Peche manor of Hampton in Arden and marry him to the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28245/', "Sir Richard Vernon")</script> of Haddon, a leading Derbyshire landowner [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52800/', "Vernon family")</script>].<br>
<br>After Warwick's death in 1439 Sir William Mountford was one of several custodians of the Warwick lands during the minority of the earl's son Henry. The others included members of Henry VI's household and, through these, Mountford acquired links to the court. These he proposed to exploit to disinherit his family by his first wife in favour of the sons of his second wife, Joan, daughter of William Alderwyche and widow of William Brokesby. <a name="cosubject_63907"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edmund Mountford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1494)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of the second marriage, was in France with his father in 1438, an esquire of the household by 1444, and MP for Warwickshire in 1447. Meanwhile Baldwin, a knight by 1437, received no royal favour and had to wait until 1449 for his first local office. By a series of miscalculations, the new earl of Warwick, Richard Neville, who succeeded Henry's infant daughter in 1449, alienated William and Edmund, with the result that these two looked for protection to Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham (who had bought the Clinton property at Maxstoke in 1438), while Baldwin looked to Warwick. After William's death in 1452 the Mountford dispute became increasingly central to Warwickshire politics, helping to cause the breach between Warwick and the royal court&#151;in which Edmund was now an influential figure&#151;and becoming the focal point of the struggle for control of the county between Warwick and Buckingham. After Queen Margaret's coup in late 1456 Edmund was able to strike and he forced a series of releases from Baldwin and Baldwin's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_63908"></a><span class="headword">Sir Simon Mountford</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1495)<span class="occ"></span>. However, even with the royal court at Coventry, it seems that Edmund could not establish himself as legitimate heir in the eyes of the Warwickshire gentry, who still preferred Baldwin as an associate. Edmund, who was a knight by mid-1459, remained conspicuously loyal to Henry VI, allegedly sheltering him at Coleshill after the battle of Blore Heath. He was attainted, went into exile with the Lancastrian royal family after the battle of Towton in 1461, and continued to fight for them until he left permanently for France with Queen Margaret in 1464.<br>
<br>The Yorkist accession gave outright victory to the senior line. Sir Baldwin immediately entered the church, styling himself thereafter &#145;knight and priest&#146;, and took almost no further part in worldly affairs. Simon, who had been knighted by 1461, and had been retained by Warwick in 1456&#150;7, should by rights have succeeded to his grandfather's position in the Warwick affinity. However, although his tenure of local office and links with other members of the affinity in the early 1460s suggested that this was to be the case, he soon contrived to fall out with Warwick. While the earl was mostly away on the king's business, Simon gathered to himself a group of dissidents within the Warwick affinity, some of them in dispute with close servants of the earl. Simon's influence spread southwards through the county. As it did so, he found the marriage alliance made in the 1450s with the daughter of Sir Richard Verney of Compton Verney in south Warwickshire, himself an adept exploiter of discord among local nobles, especially useful. In 1465 the rising levels of tension climaxed in an affray in which a servant of one of Warwick's closest followers was killed. Warwick, just back from the north with the captive Henry VI, had already removed Simon from the commission of the peace and the earl was soon in Warwickshire as head of an oyer and terminer commission into the affair. But he remained largely ineffectual in Warwickshire and deteriorating relations with the king soon forced him to come to terms with the Warwickshire dissidents. Even this did not prevent Simon's taking William Hastings's fee in 1469&#150;70 and fighting for Edward IV at Tewkesbury. Indeed, that Edmund still had hopes of returning with the restored Henry VI and recovering the Mountford estates was a strong incentive to Simon to stick with the Yorkists.<br>
<br>Under the duke of Clarence, who succeeded to the Warwick lands in 1471, Simon repeated the &#145;cuckoo in the nest&#146; pattern but on a grander scale. Emboldened by Clarence's failure to establish effective lordship in the midlands, Simon began to act as a major local political force. The royal grant of the constableship of Kenilworth Castle in 1475 and further efforts to secure the rest of the Montfort lands in 1476 indicate the scope of his ambitions. In 1475 he went to France on Edward IV's expedition and his indenting for sixty-five fighting men reveals the sort of power he had at his disposal. But his attempt on the Montfort lands came to nothing and from 1478, once Edward IV had taken over Clarence's lands and local political leadership, Simon found his wings severely clipped. He remained a pivotal figure in local society and politics and a consistent local office holder but he no longer dared to try to create an independent power base. The return and pardon in 1474 of Edmund, who was restored to a single Mountford manor (Remenham, Berkshire), were also incentives to good behaviour. Like most Warwickshire gentry, Simon kept his head well down under Richard III and, despite the reversal of Edmund's attainder after Henry VII's victory in 1485, Simon had no difficulty in being accepted as a loyal subject and local officer and indeed was present at the creation of the future Henry VIII as duke of York in 1494.<br>
<br>As the politics of Warwickshire and the counties to the north became ever more disturbed from 1487, however, Simon found it increasingly difficult to hold his own in local affairs. Unlike several of the other more prominent gentry of north Warwickshire and the north midlands, he was a law-abiding member of the local official establishment, most of whom came from the south of the county. Growing tension between the more orderly south Warwickshire gentry, most of them not favoured by the king, and the disorderly north Warwickshire and north-midlands gentry, many of whom were close to the king, led to a confrontation at the sessions of the peace in 1494, in which Simon was actively involved, standing up for the south against the north. These developments may lie behind Simon's implication in the alleged treason plot on behalf of Perkin Warbeck in January 1495 and his execution in February. Although the Henry Mountford who was part of Warbeck's invasion force later that year was probably Simon's son, and Simon may have viewed with foreboding his own alienation from his immediate neighbours and proximity of his half-uncle Edmund to the king, it would have been uncharacteristic of him to have committed treason after such a sure-footed tread through decades of political turmoil. His execution may simply have been the king's exasperated response to the turmoil in the midlands, especially since the worst offenders were people whose importance to him was such that he could not touch them. Simon's confiscated lands were divided among Simon Digby, the earl of Kildare, and Henry VII's close aide, Reynold Bray, who also succeeded to Edmund's manor of Remenham when Edmund died, apparently unmarried, in 1494. Although Simon's heir, Thomas, was partially restored in 1504, Coleshill remained with the Digbys; the family never reattained its former eminence and disposed of its remaining Warwickshire estates in the early seventeenth century. From the time at which they acquired the Peche lands, the Mountfords were an immense presence in the political life of Warwickshire; whether this was used for good or ill depended largely on the ability of the earls of Warwick and, from 1478, of the king, but from the 1460s Simon may be seen as the harbinger of that independent gentry power which arguably began to emerge in England during the political crises of the fifteenth century.<br>
<br>The family owned the advowson at Ilmington, one of their Warwickshire manors, and sometimes used it for sons who entered the church, for example Baldwin's full brother, Richard. But their main religious interest was at Coleshill. William's projected chantry there came to nothing, probably because of the prolonged dispute following his death and because Baldwin's entering the church was thought sufficient for the family souls, but family members may well have been responsible for additions to the church. The surviving evidence suggests that, although careful <i>rentiers</i>, the Mountfords tended not to exploit other sources of profit. Indeed their wealth, sufficient to set up cadet branches in nearly every generation, ensured that, even in periods of family feuding, no more than careful management was necessary. The family arms were bend of ten pieces or and azure.<br>
