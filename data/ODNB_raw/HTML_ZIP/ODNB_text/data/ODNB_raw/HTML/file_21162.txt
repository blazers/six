<span class="headword">Palladius</span>  (<em>fl. </em>429&#150;<em>c.</em>433), <span class="occ">missionary and bishop</span>, was the first bishop of the Irish. There are three direct references to him in the contemporary writings of Prosper of Aquitaine. First, in his chronicle under the year 429, the deacon Palladius is said to have been responsible for inducing Pope Celestine to send Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, as papal representative to Britain to combat Pelagianism. In the second, also in the chronicle (s.a. 431), it is written that Celestine sent Palladius as the first bishop for the Irish who believed in Christ. In the third, in Prosper's <span class="italic">Contra collatorem</span> (against Cassian, author of the <span class="roman">Conferences</span>), written a year or two later, Celestine is praised for two achievements in the far north-west: he has saved &#145;the Roman island&#146; for Catholicism and has made &#145;the barbarian island&#146; Christian  (chap. 21). The pope, therefore, was being praised for having saved Britain from Pelagianism and for having initiated the conversion of Ireland.<br>
<br>Palladius, unfortunately, was a common name in the late Roman empire, especially in the east. There was a family of Palladii in Gaul whose number included, according to Sidonius Apollinaris, both bishops and rhetoricians; they are likely to have belonged to Berry. The first bishop of the Irish has been linked with these Palladii but on no good evidence. Palladius has usually been seen as deacon of Auxerre rather than of Rome; in other words, it has been thought that Germanus sent him to Rome to obtain papal authority for his anti-Pelagian expedition to Britain. There is no positive evidence for or against this theory.<br>
<br>What remains very likely is that the mission to the Irish arose from Germanus's journey to Britain. Explicit papal policy at this period was that missions should be mounted only when those who were to be evangelized had already expressed an interest in Christianity. The Irish Christians to whom Palladius was sent must therefore have been considered a credible base from which to work; they may have requested a bishop when Germanus was in Britain. Since Germanus was then acting as papal representative, their request went to the pope; he responded by sending the same Palladius who had recommended Germanus. This small group thus brought about, in the eyes of Prosper, two notable achievements on behalf of the papacy: Celestine had saved one island from heresy and another from paganism. He had intervened in a former province where the Roman empire was now powerless, and also beyond the furthest bounds of the empire, even at its strongest. Prosper, having become the friend of Pope Leo I (<i>r</i>. 440&#150;61), lived in Rome for part of the 430s and probably for most or all of the period from 440 to 455. Leo preached a sermon to the people of Rome on the feast of Peter and Paul in 441, in which he declared that Rome, &#145;a royal and a priestly city, having been made the head of the whole world through the holy see of the blessed Peter &hellip; came to rule over a wider territory through the worship of God than by earthly domination&#146;  (Leo, ed. Chavasse, <i>Sermo</i> 82). The sermon is textually linked with Prosper's <span class="italic">De vocatione omnium gentium</span>, a work which considers both the theology and some of the practical details of missionary work. The mission of Palladius to the Irish was the clearest and most recent example which could be used to justify Leo's claim. The latter's friendship with Prosper makes it likely that he indeed had Ireland and therefore Palladius in mind.<br>
<br>Leo's sermon casts doubt, therefore, on the late seventh-century Irish account by Muirch&uacute; which makes Palladius die shortly after 431. Muirch&uacute; was manifestly making such claims in order to exalt the reputation of St Patrick as the true missionary to all the Irish, whereas the contemporary Prosper expressed, and Pope Leo's sermon implied, a continued optimism about Palladius's mission. On the other hand, Muirch&uacute; may be approximately correct in so far as he is supported by place-name evidence in associating both Palladius and the other likely early missionaries, Iserninus, Secundinus, and Auxilius, with Leinster. Those three early bishops are more likely to have been disciples of Palladius than, as Muirch&uacute;, T&iacute;rech&aacute;n, and the early annals claim, of Patrick. In the first half of the fifth century Leinster probably extended as far north as the River Boyne. This greater Leinster was the part of Ireland which has yielded most evidence of Roman influence, but it was to be reduced in size by U&iacute; N&eacute;ill conquests in the midlands, probably in the late fifth and early sixth centuries. Serious progress in the conversion of Leinster would be an achievement sufficient to give some justification to Prosper's optimistic claim that Celestine had made Ireland Christian.<br>
<br>Palladius's relationship to Patrick can only be conjectured. It was already the subject of different ideas in the late seventh century. To judge by Patrick's own writings, especially his <span class="italic">Confessio</span>, his main area of activity was in the western part of Ireland: his proudest claim was to have taken the Christian faith to the furthest western extremity of the inhabited world; and the only part of Ireland with which he is securely connected is Mayo. Palladius and Patrick may, therefore, be seen as exemplifying two stages in the geographical expansion of Christianity in Ireland: Palladius, in the 430s, found a Christian community already established, but without a bishop; he was their first bishop and probably worked in Leinster; Patrick on the other hand took Christianity to the furthest west of the island; his activity as a missionary probably belongs to the second half of the fifth century.<br>
