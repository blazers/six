<span class="headword">Vaughan,  John <span class="st"> [Jacky]</span></span>  (1799&#150;1868), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born in Worcester on 21 December 1799, a son of John Vaughan, subsequently at Sir Josiah Guest's Dowlais ironworks. He had at least two brothers. He joined his father as an ironworker in south Wales, progressing at Dowlais to become a foreman.<br>
<br>About 1825 Vaughan took a post in Carlisle as manager of a small ironworks, and in 1832 he was appointed mill manager for Losh, Wilson, and Bell's Walker ironworks near Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1839 Vaughan and Henry W. F. Bolckow agreed to enter into partnership to exploit the iron trade, Bolckow to provide the initial &pound;10,000 capital, and profits to be shared equally. The partners opened their works at Middlesbrough in 1841, making iron castings and wrought products. Vaughan in 1845&#150;6 erected four iron blast furnaces at Witton Park in co. Durham.<br>
<br>In 1850 Vaughan decided to mine the seam of ironstone cropping out on the Cleveland Hills east of Middlesbrough, soon erecting nine blast furnaces for its treatment and establishing the commercial viability of Cleveland iron. In 1855 the partners' output of manufactured iron exceeded 120,000 tons; they employed 4000 people and consumed 600,000 tons of coal. In succeeding years they continued to expand while others, attracted by their success, also produced iron in the district.<br>
<br>Jacky Vaughan was one of the great &#145;working&#146; ironmasters. From nothing he amassed a fortune estimated at close to &pound;1 million by a combination of sustained hard work and practical technical ability. After 1855 his grip on the business slackened; in 1864, when the partnership was converted into a joint-stock company with industrial assets valued at about &pound;1 million, Vaughan became deputy chairman of Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. Ltd.<br>
<br>For many years Vaughan was a Wesleyan Methodist, but then he turned towards the Church of England. He joined the first board of Tees conservancy commissioners in 1852, and a year later was among Middlesbrough's first councillors, becoming the town's third mayor in 1855. He was appointed JP and a deputy lieutenant for the North Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Vaughan was twice married, first, in the 1820s, to Eleanor Downing (or Downie) of Cumberland, with whom he had four sons but who died about 1834; and, second, to a widow, originally Anne Poole of Newcastle upon Tyne, sister of Henry Bolckow's first wife. The youngest son by his first marriage, Thomas, survived to inherit the major part of the estate, including Gunnergate Hall in Yorkshire. By his second marriage John Vaughan had no children of his own, but his wife's three children by previous marriages took his name. He died at his house, 1 Hyde Park Gate, London, on 16 September 1868.<br>
