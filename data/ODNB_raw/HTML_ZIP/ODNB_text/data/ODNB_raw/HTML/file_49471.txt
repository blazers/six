<span class="headword">Coppack,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1895&#150;1981), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born on 14 August 1895, at East View, High Street, Connah's Quay, Flintshire, the fourth child and second son of Thomas Coppack (<i>c</i>.1867&#150;1940), shipowner, of Connah's Quay, and Elizabeth Ann Butler (<i>d</i>. 1956) of Burton Stather, Lincolnshire, daughter of a shipbuilder. He was always known as Tom. The family had its origins in Norway, and Coppack is a corruption of the Norwegian name Kopeck. It was a maritime family in a maritime community, long settled on the Dee. Connah's Quay was one of the many busy ports which were concerned with the important coastal trade. Coppack's paternal grandfather, Captain John Coppack, had retired from the sea to become a shipowner about 1860. His firm, using the extensive development of the local brick, tile, and coal industries, found good business for its schooners, and also undertook the agency work for other vessels which they loaded. To this they added ship chandlery and ship repairing in association with members of the Butler family from Burton Stather. In the 1880s Captain Coppack ventured successfully into small steam coasters, whose higher cost made it much more important to keep them busy. Captain Coppack retired in the 1890s, and was succeeded by his second son, Thomas, and, for a time, the captain's brothers. Many other relatives were also seafarers. In 1910 the firm owned six steamers, seven sailing vessels, and a tug.<br>
<br>Coppack had his only formal education at St Mark's church school, Connah's Quay, although the family attended the Methodist chapel; later they moved to the Anglican church. However, his father's recurrent asthma meant that he started in the firm's office when he was eight years old. He had expected to go to sea, and he did make a number of voyages in the firm's ships, but his father's illness, and probably his own aptitude, brought him increasingly into management together with his eldest brother, John William (who died in the 1960s and with whom he shared membership of freemasonry). Between 1916 and 1919, Coppack served in the Royal Navy as a signalman, mostly with convoy commodores. On his return, he married Elsie, daughter of John Jones, a builder, of Shotton, near Connah's Quay. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>His early practical experience gave Coppack a thorough knowledge of the coasting trade, where owners needed to know the characteristics of the many ports, the different types of cargo, the vessels employed, as well as the capacities of the men in their employ. His father was a hard driver of both his ships and his men, but in 1926 ill health finally compelled him to retire and Coppack and his elder brother became the principals of the firm, buying out three other brothers. They maintained the strict regime which had given Coppacks such a good name for reliable service in such ventures as the potato trade from western France to England, where quick delivery of perishable cargoes was necessary. Coppack, with great aptitude for the complex calculations and judgements involved in arranging satisfactory charters, dealt with that department.<br>
<br>The First World War ended the era of commercial sail on the coast, and the Coppacks sold their last schooner in 1922. Henceforth they owned nothing but the smaller type of steam coaster with a single hatch, usually having four or five at any given time. The firm still traded in many familiar Irish sea passages, such as Connah's Quay bricks and tiles or Point of Ayr coal to all parts of Ireland, and stone from the north Wales quarries to Liverpool and elsewhere; but coasters, like deep sea tramps, were always open to the charter taking them further afield and so they still participated in the spring fruit and potato business from the Channel Islands and Brittany. Attention to the cleanliness of holds also gained them regular china clay cargoes from Cornwall to Grimsby.<br>
<br>Between the wars was a difficult period with boom and slump, and a collapse of rates but not of expenses, a pattern repeated after 1945. The coasting business in general gradually contracted: although the agency business remained active, the local industries no longer had such extensive connections and cargoes became very local, while the disadvantages of Connah's Quay became too evident. However, the firm had many regular shippers and the business remained viable. The Coppacks kept trading until 1965 when Tom Coppack retired in favour of his nephew and niece.<br>
<br>Coppack was slim, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with dark, wavy hair. He had a quick mind, and there was usually a twinkle in his eye. His equable personality and unremitting attention to detail could get the best out of men. Although the firm never sought a national place, Coppack was a coasting shipowner of much repute. In retirement he wrote a fascinating autobiography, <span class="italic">A Lifetime with Ships</span> (1973), which charts a vanished era of maritime history. He lived at or near Connah's Quay all his working life, but after the death of his wife he moved about 1980 to Sheffield to live with his surviving daughter. He died in Nether Edge Hospital, Sheffield, from bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular problems on 23 November 1981.<br>
