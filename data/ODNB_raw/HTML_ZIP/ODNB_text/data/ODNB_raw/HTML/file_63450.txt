<span class="headword">Awolowo, Obafemi</span>  (1909&#150;1987), <span class="occ">politician in Nigeria</span>, was born on 6 March 1909 at Ikenne, a small town about 40 miles from Lagos, in Ijebu Remo division, the son of David Sopolu Awolowo (<i>d</i>. 1920) and his wife, Mary Sofowora Efunyela. The Ijebu are a subgroup of the Yoruba, one of the largest and most developed peoples of Nigeria. His father, a farmer and timber dealer, had become a Christian in 1896, one of the first converts in the town, and Obafemi, his eldest son, was baptized Jeremiah (a name he later stopped using). Awolowo's education, begun in local mission schools, was disrupted when his father died suddenly of smallpox in 1920, and he went to live with his maternal grandmother in the much larger town of Abeokuta, where he worked at odd jobs to pay for more education. In 1927 he spent a year at Wesley College, Ibadan. Returning to Abeokuta in 1928, he worked as a junior teacher and took correspondence courses in commercial subjects. After a spell as a typist in Lagos and a period of unemployment, he returned to Wesley College as its clerk, all the while taking further courses, now in law and journalism, which would enable him to pursue his ambition to go to England and qualify as a lawyer. Shortage of funds, however, meant that more than a decade passed&#151;occupied in journalism, public letter-writing, moneylending, motor transporting, and produce trading&#151;before he could realize it. In 1944 he finally got to London, took the degree of LLB, and was admitted to the bar as a member of the Inner Temple. Back in Nigeria in 1947, he at once set up a lucrative legal practice, based in the Yoruba metropolis, Ibadan.<br>
<br>Awolowo's nationalism first showed itself in his attitude of resistance to authority at Wesley College and in his rejection for a number of years of the Christianity in which he had been reared for an agnostic rationalism inspired by the writings of Tom Paine, T. H. Huxley, and Robert G. Ingersoll. It started to take on a more political shape after he became active in the Nigerian Youth Movement, founded in 1934, which was the first nationalist organization to seek to promote itself outside the capital, Lagos. In the 1930s, too, Awolowo became, as he put it, &#145;a fanatical admirer&#146;  (Awolowo, <span class="italic">Awo</span>, 160) of the Indian National Congress. While in London, Awolowo helped to found Egbe Omo Oduduwa (Society of the Descendants of Oduduwa), a Yoruba cultural organization which would play a key role in shaping Yoruba political consciousness. In his <span class="italic">Path to Nigerian Freedom</span> (1947) Awolowo argued that only a federal constitution could accommodate the diversity of Nigeria's languages and cultures.<br>
<br>After 1947 Nigeria's division into three highly autonomous regions&#151;Northern, Western, and Eastern&#151;each dominated by one of the three largest ethnic groups&#151;respectively Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo&#151;as well as personal rivalries, led to a fragmentation of the nationalist movement. In 1950, with the first national elections looming, Awolowo, with other associates in the Egbe Omo Oduduwa, formed a Yoruba-based party, the Action Group (AG). After the AG had won the 1951 election in Western Nigeria, Awolowo became leader of its government (premier from 1954) for the next eight years. With the region's buoyant cocoa revenues the AG government was able to achieve many of its goals, notably the introduction of free primary education, expanded medical services, and extensive infrastructural investment. Though the AG proclaimed itself as &#145;democratic socialist&#146;, its reality was more &eacute;litist and welfarist. Awolowo's concern to improve the lot of the &#145;common man&#146; went with an assumption that the educated &eacute;lite must give social direction to the whole, and he always showed much respect for the traditional Yoruba hierarchy of <i>oba</i> (&#145;kings&#146;) and chiefs. In any case, AG policies worked in practice to consolidate a new &#145;bourgeois&#146; class, based on an alliance of commercial wealth, educated status, and access to the levers of state power.<br>
<br>When Nigeria became independent in 1960 Awolowo faced an acute political dilemma. While his party ruled the Western Region, control of the federal government fell to a coalition of its two main rivals, the northern-based Northern People's Congress (NPC) and the eastern-based National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons. Awolowo had struggled to throw off the AG's image as a &#145;Yoruba&#146; party by vigorous campaigning for support among ethnic minority groups in the other two regions, and he now chose to move to the centre as federal leader of the opposition, leaving his deputy, S. L. Akintola, to succeed him as premier of the Western Region. By 1962 a split had developed within the party between Awolowo and a &#145;radical&#146; wing which wanted to push opposition at the centre, and a &#145;conservative&#146; faction under Akintola, which wanted to secure its position in the west by coming to terms with the other two parties. By moving to the centre, Awolowo had weakened his regional power base, and his opponents moved to strike him down. A federal commission of inquiry found much evidence of corruption in the AG's management of the Western Region, and in 1963 Awolowo was imprisoned for allegedly plotting to overthrow the federal government by force. His prestige among his fellow Yoruba rose to new heights during his imprisonment (1963&#150;6), when he was widely seen in terms of an almost Christ-like archetype as the &#145;suffering servant&#146; of his people, unjustly treated and excluded from power.<br>
<br>The military coup of 1966 cleared the way for Awolowo's release from prison. When the former Eastern Region attempted to secede from Nigeria as the republic of Biafra, thus precipitating the civil war of 1967 to 1970, Awolowo's stance was at first thought to be equivocal, but he rallied for the integrity of Nigeria. He was brought into the government of General Yakubu Gowon, serving as vice-chairman of the federal executive council and finance minister until 1971, when he retired to private life and his law practice.<br>
<br>With the prospect of a return to civilian rule in the late 1970s, Awolowo's political ambition resurfaced: he became the leader and presidential candidate of the United Party of Nigeria (UPN), essentially a revival of the AG, with its main base of support among the Yoruba. In the 1979 presidential election, however, Awolowo lost to Shehu Shagari, the candidate of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN), whose core was drawn from the former northern-based NPC. Awolowo had again failed to build a broad enough alliance with non-Yoruba groups. After Shagari and the NPN defeated Awolowo's UPN in 1983 (in an election fraudulent even by Nigerian standards), only to be displaced by a further military coup, Awolowo's public career was all but over. He died on 9 May 1987, survived by his wife, and was buried in his home town, Ikenne. Subsequently, by federal decree, the University of Ife, whose foundation had been one of the most cherished projects of the AG, was renamed Obafemi Awolowo University.<br>
<br>Throughout his political career Awolowo received unstinting support from his wife, Hannah Idowu Dideolu Adelana, whom he had married on 26 December 1937; they had two sons and two daughters. The death in a motor accident in 1963, during his trial, of his elder son, Segun, then starting out on a legal career, was a severe blow to Awolowo. By then he had abandoned his youthful agnosticism and had become rather pious, regularly attending Agbeni Methodist Church in Ibadan and St Saviour's Anglican Church at Ikenne. Awolowo came to regard himself as in some sense divinely mandated in his political career, and his practices of ascetic self-discipline gave, in the eyes of many, a spiritual dimension to his leadership. He was perhaps the most revered and the most detested of the Nigerian politicians of his time. While opponents might see him as inflexible and self-righteous, untrustworthy, and something of an Ijebu or Yoruba chauvinist, his intelligence, clarity of vision, and firmness of purpose, and the forceful lucidity of his speeches and writings gained him a devoted following.<br>
