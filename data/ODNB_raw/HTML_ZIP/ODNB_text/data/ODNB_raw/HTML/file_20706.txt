<span class="headword">Oliphant,  James</span>  (1734&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in Stirling, the second son of William Oliphant. He entered the University of Glasgow in 1753 and earned an MA three years later. In 1757 Oliphant matriculated at the Associate Burgher Hall, the seceders' divinity school at Glasgow, but he attended only four sessions before leaving the secession movement because of differences with some of the professors at the school. He subsequently joined the Church of Scotland, receiving his licence to preach from the presbytery of Kintyre on 19 May 1760. He was admitted to the Gorbals Chapel of Ease, Glasgow, in 1763, and on 17 May 1764 was ordained to the chapel of ease in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. Six months later, on 27 November, he married Elizabeth Hay (<i>d</i>. 1780). In October 1773 Oliphant was presented to Dumbarton by its town council, acting on the request of the inhabitants, and he was settled there on 23 December. He also served as clerk of the presbytery of Dumbarton from 1783 to 1817. Following the death of his first wife, on 29 March 1780 shortly after giving birth to their seventh child, he married, on 27 April 1784, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1805), daughter of Humphrey Colquhoun of Barnhill and Margaret Williamson, with whom he had five more children.<br>
<br>Although Oliphant was described by J. W. Taylor as &#145;a sound and racy theologian, and an interesting and highly accomplished preacher&#146;, he also provoked considerable opposition, even ridicule. In <span class="italic">The Ordination</span> (1786), Robert Burns, who had heard Oliphant preach at Kilmarnock, lampooned him for his booming voice, as well as the opposition to common sense of Oliphant and his Kilmarnock colleague, John Russell:<blockquote>
<div>Curst Common-sense, that imp o' h-ll,<br>
</div>
<div>Cam' in wi' Maggie Lauder;<br>
</div>
<div>But O[liphant] aft made her yell,<br>
</div>
<div>An' R[ussell] sair misca'd her.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span>, 2.213, ll. 10&#150;14)</blockquote>Oliphant's high Calvinism also inspired the hostility of clergymen whose theological views emphasized the role of free will in religious life. In 1773 his Kilmarnock opponents even hired a man to walk the streets of Dumbarton, purporting to sell &#145;the whole works of the Rev. James Oliphant, presentee to this parish, for the small charge of two pence&#146;.<br>
<br>Oliphant compiled strict Calvinist catechisms for the use of schools and young communicants, and they attracted the greatest attention during his ministry. His <span class="italic">Mother's Catechism</span> (1770) went through more than twenty editions, and his <span class="italic">Sacramental Catechism</span> (1772) was also immensely popular. He also wrote the account of the parish of Dumbarton in Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1792).<br>
<br>Oliphant lost his eyesight several years before his death, which occurred on 10 April 1818.<br>
