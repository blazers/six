</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dibdin,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1745, <em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">actor, composer, and writer</span>, was baptized privately (possibly because he was sickly at birth) on 4 March 1745 at Southampton, and again publicly on 26 March at Holyrood Church, Southampton, where his father, Thomas Dibdin, was parish clerk; his mother's name has been given as Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wesgarth.<h2>
<a name="Youthandearlycareer"></a>Youth and early career</h2>Charles was probably the twelfth of fourteen children, and his father was &#145;a silversmith, a man of considerable credit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Professional Life</span>, 1.15); nothing is known of his mother's family. His father died when he was young and the family moved to Winchester. When he was nine his fine voice won him a position as chorister at Winchester Cathedral under the organist, Peter Fussell. Dibdin's claim that he was educated at Winchester College is not supported by the school records, although he certainly received substantial schooling from some source in that town. James Kent composed anthems for him, and he and Fussell probably provided Dibdin's earliest musical training. At about the age of eleven he applied for the post of organist at Wathum, Hampshire, but was rejected on account of his youth and probably his lack of musical qualifications; however, anthem parts in his earliest notebook suggest that he had a substantial early grounding in music.<br>
<br>Dibdin next accepted an invitation from his elder brother Thomas (later the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7588/', "Thomas Frognall Dibdin")</script>) to move to London. There he quickly learned extempore playing at the organ, and he often played the congregation out at St Bride's, Fleet Street. He also entered into a working relationship (unlikely to have been as an apprentice) with the music and instrument seller John Johnson; later he claimed that all he did at Johnson's shop, the Harp and Crown in Cheapside, was to tune harpsichords. Thomas sailed with the <i>Hope</i> in 1757, during the Seven Years' War, and the ship was captured by the French. Charles Dibdin soon discerned a cooling of interest by his brother's friends, and one of them, Richard Berenger, an Irishman, advised him that this was because of his refusal to act as a &#145;fiddler and a buffoon&#146; while in their company; Berenger advised him to consider the stage as a career. According to Dibdin, at that point he had never been to the theatre or opera:<blockquote>I have no power of expression that can give the faintest idea of what I felt when I heard the first crash of an overture. What an immense distinction between this electrical power and the clerical strumming I had been accustomed to in the country! I was music mad; but what astonished me most was that, merely from hearing how the parts were combined and worked together in the band, I completely learnt the secret of composition. (<span class="italic">Professional Life</span>, 1.20)</blockquote>It is probable that much more was learned from practical experience in the theatres.By December 1760 Dibdin was occasionally performing with the chorus at Covent Garden, and on 18 April 1761 he shared the benefit with other minor players. John Rich, the licensee, believing that Dibdin would ultimately possess a deep bass voice like Richard Leveridge, encouraged him and made introductions. He gained added experience performing at the &#145;Histrionic Academy&#146; at the theatre in Richmond in the summer of 1762. The next year he published a few songs and <span class="italic">A Collection of English Songs and Cantatas</span>. That summer he joined Younger's acting company at Birmingham, sang his own songs at Vauxhall, and acted in other towns. In 1764 his all-sung pastoral <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Artifice</span> was accepted by John Beard at Covent Garden for performance as the afterpiece at Dibdin's own benefit on 22 May; besides writing both the words and music, Dibdin sang the main role of Strephon. He returned to Birmingham that summer. Although he did not have the appearance necessary to be a leading man, his singing ability and his wide range of dialects ensured a great success in character roles.<br>
<br>Beard thrust Dibdin into the role of Ralph in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> and his performance, beginning on 31 January 1765, was one of the great successes of the decade; every song was encored, and he even set a fashion for &#145;Ralph-handkerchiefs&#146;. The opera ran for more than fifty performances. Having had his salary increased by 10<i>s</i>. on each of three successive Saturdays, Dibdin was soon offered a three-year set of articles at a salary of &pound;3, &pound;4, and &pound;5 per week.<br>
<br>For the next two years Dibdin spent the summers at Thomas Lowe's new theatre at Richmond and the winter seasons acting at Covent Garden, all the while continuing to compose songs. His next major success came on 21 February 1767, when he created the role of Watty Cockney in Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in the City</span>, for which he also composed a substantial portion of the score. On 16 May 1767 Dibdin became the first person to play the pianoforte in public in England, when he accompanied Miss Brickler in a song from <span class="italic">Judith</span> (written by Bickerstaff and Thomas Arne). That summer, at Richmond, his <span class="italic">The Village Wedding</span> was produced on 18 July. In the 1767&#150;8 season he composed two-thirds of the music for Bickerstaff's highly successful <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span>. At about this time he established a sexual relationship with the dancer and actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22329/', "Harriet Pitt (1748?&#150;1814)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22326/', "Pitt, Ann")</script>]; they had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7586/', "Charles Isaac Mungo Dibdin (1768&#150;1833)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7589/', "Thomas John Dibdin (1771&#150;1841)")</script>, and a daughter, Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1770), who performed as a dancer under the name Harriet Pitt.<h2>
<a name="TheDruryLaneyears"></a>The Drury Lane years</h2>When Dibdin was dismissed by the new patentee of Covent Garden, George Colman, at the end of the 1767 season, Bickerstaff came to his defence. David Garrick was able to achieve the double coup of hiring both Bickerstaff and Dibdin for his Drury Lane company, as much to deny their talents to his rivals as for his own use. Their opera <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> (originally intended for Samuel Foote's Little Theatre in the Haymarket) was a great success. Dibdin not only supplied all the music but, following John Moody's withdrawal, achieved another major success, in the part of the servant Mungo, the first blackface role in British theatre; &#145;Mungo here, Mungo dere, Mungo ev'ry where&#146;, from one of his songs, became a major catchphrase. Dibdin sold the copyright in his music to Bickerstaff, who in 1769 sued two music engravers, Henry Fought and Henry Roberts, for publishing it without his permission. Dibdin had no direct interest in the case, which did not come to court, but the ownership of his work was to become a major concern.<br>
<br>Dibdin's brother Thomas had been imprisoned for debts and, to assist him before he took up an appointment in India, Charles Dibdin had run up a substantial debt to Garrick which he could not repay, and the relationship between the two deteriorated. As a result, Dibdin secured an agreement with Ranelagh Gardens to compose music for the next two summers at &pound;100 per season; the Dibdin/Bickerstaff <span class="italic">Ephesian Matron</span> was first performed on 12 May 1769. Moreover, the Dibdin/Bickerstaff opera <span class="italic">The Captive</span> appeared on 21 June at the Haymarket, where Dibdin also sang ballads during the summer.<br>
<br>In the autumn the Stratford jubilee, honouring the 250th anniversary of the death of Shakespeare, used much music composed specially by Dibdin. Severe ructions with Garrick continued and were appeased only by Dibdin's song &#145;Let beauty with the sun arise&#146;, performed by the musicians beneath the window of Garrick's rooms at the inn at daybreak. Virtually none of the newspapers noticed Dibdin's contributions (or, for that matter, those by Fran&ccedil;ois-Hippolyte Barth&eacute;lemon and Theodore Aylward), concentrating instead on the <span class="italic">Ode</span> composed by Arne.<br>
<br>During the 1769&#150;70 season Dibdin continued to perform at Drury Lane. For Ranelagh he composed the music for Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid the Mistress</span> and <span class="italic">The Recruiting Sergeant</span>, as well as singing the tenor or falsetto roles. In summer 1770 he contributed songs at Sadler's Wells and Marylebone Gardens. The following season Dibdin's dramatic appearances at Drury Lane appear to have been limited to the chorus, although he did compose the music for Garrick's masque <span class="italic">The Institution of the Garter</span>. He also composed a number of glees and catches as entr'acte pieces, some of which he performed at his benefit on 1 May, for which his profit was &pound;65 12<i>s</i>. Among his compositions in summer 1771 was music for <span class="italic">The Palace of Mirth</span> at Sadler's Wells, now managed by his friend Tom King.<br>
<br>In May 1772 potentially one of the greatest partnerships of eighteenth-century opera was broken up when an accusation of sodomy forced Bickerstaff to decamp to France. Dibdin subsequently strove to dissociate himself from Bickerstaff, although even as late as the 1790s there were rumours that Bickerstaff wrote Dibdin's lyrics. Dibdin publicly came to Garrick's defence when William Kenrick published his infamous <span class="italic">Roscius's Lamentation for the Loss of his Nyky</span>; he may have feared the accusations against Bickerstaff would be extended to him and so sought to restore his relationship with Garrick. During the 1772&#150;3 season Dibdin continued to take character roles, and he provided the music for James Messink's pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Foundling</span> (from 26 December). On 1 February his successful comic opera based on Goldoni, <span class="italic">The Wedding Ring</span>, was produced anonymously. The audience believed that the text was by Bickerstaff and a riot almost erupted, averted only by Dibdin's admission of authorship. Dibdin sang in several benefit performances and that spring and summer provided both text and music for a number of productions at Sadler's Wells, a relationship which continued the following year. His reputation was not all positive, however:<blockquote>
<div>DIBDIN, alas! we nearly had forgot,<br>
</div>
<div>Perhaps oblivion were the kindest lot;<br>
</div>
<div>How he <i>composes</i>, 'tis not fit, we say,<br>
</div>
<div>But grant kind stars that he may never <i>play</i>:<br>
</div>
<div>Nor, to enlarge our wish, may never sing;<br>
</div>
<div>MUNGO in this, in that, and ev'ry thing.<br>
</div> (Nipclose, 53)</blockquote>In December 1773 he contributed the music to Garrick's extravaganza <span class="italic">A Christmas Tale</span>. Although he was earning &pound;6 per week plus extras at Drury Lane, as well as additional moneys from publication of his music and commissions for the public gardens, he continued to borrow against wages. His opera <span class="italic">The Waterman</span> had been rejected by Garrick for the 1773&#150;4 season; Foote produced it to great success at the Haymarket in the summer, and Garrick immediately sent his brother George to charge Dibdin with disloyalty. Relations continued to deteriorate throughout the production of <span class="italic">The Cobbler</span>, and at the beginning of the 1774&#150;5 season Dibdin was found to be in debt to the theatre for about &pound;200. Despite his claims that he would have been affluent had proper payments for his music been made, he was forced to give up his salary&#151;by then, of &pound;7 per week&#151;until the debt was paid. Dibdin sold his opera <span class="italic">The Quaker</span> for &pound;10 to William Brereton for his benefit (the latter realized &pound;36 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. on the night). Brereton then sold the rights for &pound;100 to Garrick, who suppressed the work; it was not produced until 1777, after Garrick had left Drury Lane.<h2>
<a name="Freelanceyears"></a>Freelance years</h2>Dibdin was discharged from Drury Lane at the end of the 1775 season. It is impossible to say whether the break with Garrick was due to Dibdin's treatment of his mistress Harriet Pitt (Garrick was godfather to their second son, Thomas), on account of Dibdin's having become undependable regarding rehearsals, or because of Garrick's jealousy. References to an earlier marriage have not been substantiated, and the relationship with Harriet Pitt was probably considered irregular, as she already had a child out of wedlock before she met Dibdin. At about this time Dibdin transferred his affection to Anne Maria Wylde (1757&#150;1835), of Portsea, possibly a relative of the prompter James Wild, and quickly married her. They had at least one daughter, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1776).<br>
<br>Dibdin composed a puppet play, <span class="italic">The Comic Mirror, or, The World as it Wags</span>, which included a satire on Garrick; it opened at the Grand Saloon at the Exeter Change on 24 June 1775 and ran for four months. In February 1776 it was revived at Marylebone Gardens. However, with no steady employment and hounded by creditors, Dibdin extracted a promise from Samuel Arnold to oversee pieces he might send, and fled to France. Dibdin claimed that his first popular sea song, &#145;Blow High, Blow Low&#146;, was composed during the stormy thirteen-hour channel crossing; it was featured in his opera <span class="italic">The Seraglio</span>, produced at Covent Garden on 14 November 1776. He spent five months in Calais, avoiding the English locals, and then moved to Nancy, where he continued to learn French and to read&#151;and translate and adapt&#151;French dramas. While in France he sent pieces back to London, of which the most prophetic concerning his future productions was <span class="italic">Yo Yeah, or, The Friendly Tars</span> (Sadler's Wells, 18 August 1777). <span class="italic">Poor Vulcan</span>, much altered by Arne and Arnold, was a success at Covent Garden on 4 February 1778.<br>
<br>Forced to return to England in June 1778 by France's involvement in the American War of Independence, Dibdin agreed with the patentee-manager, Thomas Harris, to write three afterpieces for Covent Garden for the 1778&#150;9 season. He also rapidly &#145;wrote&#146; several plays based on French originals for production at the Haymarket. From 1778 until 1782 he was composer to the Covent Garden theatre at &pound;10 per week, generally producing two pantomimes and a comic opera each year. Dibdin's attempts (1780&#150;81) to publish his songs in monthly anthologies as <span class="italic">The Monthly Lyrist</span>, later <span class="italic">The Lyrist, or, Family Concert</span>, proved unsuccessful. Uneasy in his relations with Covent Garden, he began in 1780 to think about joining his elder brother, now a wealthy man, in India; this plan was scuppered when he learned Thomas had died at sea while returning to England. Dibdin returned to Covent Garden and produced three successes&#151;<span class="italic">The Islanders</span>, the important pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Freemason</span> (29 December 1780), and the burletta <span class="italic">Jupiter and Alcmena</span> (based on John Dryden's <span class="italic">Amphitryon</span>, with music by Dibdin and William Shield). Although the last-mentioned was a dramatic success, it was a financial failure, and Dibdin parted company with Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Philip Astley had already demonstrated the popularity of the equestrian theatre, and, in partnership with a Colonel West and some inexperienced amateurs, Dibdin built a theatre for &pound;15,000 on the Surrey shore, outside the jurisdiction of the lord chamberlain. The Royal Circus and Philharmonic Academy opened in November 1782. It appeared to be successful, but Dibdin claimed he was undermined by Charles Hughes, who managed the equestrian business, and the elder Joseph Grimaldi, who oversaw the pantomimes; however, the collapse of the partnership may have been due as much to Dibdin's excessive ambitions. He provided at least twenty-eight works over the 1782&#150;4 seasons and had hoped to develop the Royal Circus into a major theatre and school for young performers; possibly as many as fifty took up residence, but the theatre's finances could not support their board and lessons. When the Surrey magistrates closed the theatre in 1784, Hughes succeeded in obtaining a licence for himself; Dibdin was unsuccessful in going to law for his share of the moveables, but he continued to supply the Royal Circus with works for many years. Other than the success of <span class="italic">Liberty Hall</span>, for Drury Lane in the 1784&#150;5 season, Dibdin's only other client at this period was Sadler's Wells.<br>
<br>Dibdin was approached by a Clerkenwell architect, Jacob Leroux, about building a theatre, the Helicon, near St Pancras; when the project was abandoned Dibdin had lost about &pound;290. He was also bilked by the Dublin theatre manager Richard Daly, who purchased a number of musical works but paid only about a quarter of what had been agreed. Dibdin retired to the country in 1786, managed to sell a few works to the minor theatres, and published the hebdomadal work <span class="italic">The Devil</span>, which was discontinued after twenty-one numbers. He again decided to leave England for India, and embarked on a fourteen-month tour of the provinces with a one-man show; the tour was documented in a series of letters which were published as <span class="italic">The musical tour of Mr. Dibdin; in which &hellip; previous to his embarkation for India &hellip; he finished his career as a public character</span>. Having sold most of his possessions, including songs such as &#145;Nothing but Grog&#146;, for very little money, Dibdin and his family set sail in the autumn of 1788 but only reached Dunkirk before heavy weather forced the ship back to Torbay. He quarrelled with the captain, and returned to London.<h2>
<a name="Thesoloperformeryears"></a>The solo performer years</h2>Once again in danger of arrest by his creditors, Dibdin engaged Fischer's (some sources say Hutchin's) Auction Rooms, King Street, Covent Garden, and from 23 January 1789 staged <span class="italic">The Whim of the Moment, or, Nature in Little</span>, the first of his many &#145;table entertainments&#146;, for which he composed all the lyrics, music, and introductions, and, three times a week, performed as a solo singer to his own accompaniment. The first night's audience numbered only sixteen, but attendance soon increased. Dibdin moved to King and Chapman's Auction Room on 29 April, and the season was a relative success.<br>
<br>From the result of his farewell tour Dibdin had realized that his business was to make his audience laugh rather than to lecture them&#151;and he decided that broad humour and anecdote between songs was the answer. This attitude laid the basis for fifteen years of success in his solo shows. Full entertainments included about thirty songs, or twenty if there was an afterpiece of about ten songs. Dibdin also established a shop for selling his own songs, thereby avoiding losing his copyrights and receiving full value from sales; his songs were extremely popular, and printed and manuscript copies appear in virtually every private English music collection of the late eighteenth century. It was at this point in his career that many of his most popular songs were composed, notably &#145;Tom Bowling&#146; (1789), &#145;Poor Jack&#146; (1789), and &#145;Push the Grog About&#146; (1789)&#151;all sea songs of patriotic sentiment.<br>
<br>From the 1789&#150;90 season onwards Dibdin was at the Lyceum Theatre, performing <span class="italic">The Oddities, or, Dame Nature in a Frolic</span> from 7 December 1789. He also supplied a number of farces for the Royal Circus and published <span class="italic">The Bystander, or, Universal Weekly Expositor</span> from 22 August 1789 to 6 February 1790. He was contacted by Harris concerning presenting his songs as <span class="italic">A Divertisement</span> at Covent Garden and agreed, since this established the precedent of requesting permission to use his songs; because he assisted the theatre with scoring and production he was also entitled to a considerable payment. Dibdin's 1790&#150;91 season included another success, <span class="italic">The Wags, or, The Camp of Pleasure</span>, from 18 October 1790. The next year he moved to the Polygraphic Rooms, where he produced <span class="italic">Private Theatricals, or, Nature in nubibus</span> from 31 October 1791.<br>
<br>For the 1792&#150;3 season Dibdin moved to 411 Strand, opposite Beaufort Buildings, calling the room where he presented his entertainments the Sans Souci Theatre; <span class="italic">The Quizes, or, A Trip to Elysium</span> was the first work produced there (from 13 October 1792). An account of a performance of this piece, made by John O'Keeffe in his <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, described how Dibdin &#145;ran on sprightly and with nearly a laughing face, like a friend who enters hastily to impart to you some good news&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 2.322), and indicates that Dibdin's customized keyboard (which, besides combining a piano with organ stops including a trumpet, also had a number of pedals for adding drums, cymbals, tambourine, and gong) was already in use by that date. Dibdin's mode of singing was probably in the earlier English ballad-opera tradition rather than the increasingly ornate Italian opera style of the 1790s. By this time he was well established enough to refuse free passes for most reviewers and their friends. Dibdin continued to add new works, at the Sans Souci, circulating them in repertory, though he was also active in other areas, publishing the novel <span class="italic">The Younger Brother</span> at the beginning of January 1793. In May 1796 he published a further novel, <span class="italic">Hannah Hewit, or, The Female Crusoe</span>; Tom, his late brother, was said to be the basis for Captain Higgins.<br>
<br>Conditions at the Sans Souci Theatre deteriorated, and during summer 1796 Dibdin erected the 500 seat New Sans Souci Theatre in Leicester Place, Leicester Square, paying &pound;6000 in ready money. The building, a large house with the theatre behind, used the side walls of the two adjoining properties, so that only front and back walls plus roof had to be added. <span class="italic">How Do You Do</span> (this &#145;daily paper&#146; was the work of Francis Godolphin Waldron and Dibdin) states:<blockquote>When the curtain draws up, the stage presents the interior of an elegant tent, with the front and back parts of it open, so that Mr. DIBDIN appears to stand within it, while the back view presents a perspective of a garden scene, enriched with a temple and a sheet of water. (<span class="italic">How Do You Do</span>, 7, 22 Oct 1796)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The General Election</span> (from 8 October 1796) was the first entertainment in the theatre, and it was followed by more new short works, including <span class="italic">Datchet Mead, or, The Fairy Court</span> (from 20 May 1797), written to commemorate the marriage of Charlotte, princess royal. Publication of his five-volume <span class="italic">A Complete History of the English Stage</span> also began during the 1796&#150;7 season.<br>
<br>At some point during the early 1790s Dibdin had begun to take his table entertainments to a selected area of the provinces during the summer months. The tours could both exploit and enhance the popularity of his songs during the French revolutionary wars, when the public was more sensitive than ever to the sacrifices of the British sailor and soldier, and protective of the national customs Dibdin also celebrated in song. Not only did this provide extra income, but it also allowed him opportunities to compose songs for the next London season, as well as to indulge his hobby of oil painting. He carried on a large correspondence, observing the country, and these letters served as the basis for his two-volume <span class="italic">Observations of a tour through almost the whole of England, and a considerable part of Scotland, in a series of letters, addressed to a large number of intelligent and respectable friends</span> (published in parts from 5 November 1800 to 10 April 1802), with engravings from his paintings and drawings by his daughter Anne. He continued to present new entertainments at the New Sans Souci, among them in the 1802&#150;03 season <span class="italic">Most Votes</span> (from 9 October), which was unsuccessful and was withdrawn before Christmas; however, Dibdin had the innovatory idea of publishing a book of the lyrics as well as the individual songs.<br>
<br>Dibdin was approaching his sixtieth year and, intending to retire, completed and published his four volumes of memoirs as <span class="italic">The Professional Life of Mr. Dibdin</span>. The title clearly states the intent of the work, and accusations of omitting personal details miss this point; however, the work is often inaccurate, biased, and opinionated. From 1789 onwards each chapter includes the lyrics of the songs from that year's entertainment.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>As a renewal of war with Napoleonic France loomed in 1803, Addington's government finally recognized the value of Dibdin's songs and commissioned him to publish each month a patriotic song suitable for ships, camp, and home. Following the declaration of war against France in May 1803, Dibdin published monthly eight <span class="italic">British War Songs</span> (4 June 1803 to 4 January 1804), with accompaniments for piano, small military band, and two flutes or guitars. These songs then formed the backbone of <span class="italic">Britons Strike Home</span>, which opened on 17 September, adding greatly to patriotic fervour. As a result of his efforts, including abandoning his usual summer tour of the provinces, Dibdin was awarded a pension of &pound;200 by the government.<br>
<br>Dibdin retired at the end of the 1804&#150;05 season and sold the New Sans Souci Theatre and his music stock to Bland and Weller for &pound;1800 and three years' annuities of &pound;100 for any songs he should compose. Whereas for several years he had produced several new entertainments and dozens of new songs, in 1806 he produced only <span class="italic">The Passions, in a Series of Ten Songs</span> and the ballad opera <span class="italic">The Broken Gold</span>, and in 1807 only the novel <span class="italic">Henry Hooka</span>, before the new Grenville government revoked his pension. Financial pressure forced him to leave his country home at Cranford, Middlesex, and return to work. He published <span class="italic">The Musical Mentor, or, St Cecilia at School</span>, and on 1 March 1808, although his voice was well past its best, he returned to his entertainments with <span class="italic">Professional Volunteers</span> at the Lyceum. Using his experience as a singing teacher (among his pupils was Rosemund Mountain), he also published several more music pamphlets. He presented <span class="italic">Rent Day, or, The Yeoman's Friend</span>, from 17 September at the Sans Pareil Theatre (opposite the Adelphi in the Strand) and probably from November <span class="italic">The Melange</span> at the Assembly Rooms, Cateaton Street, but also at the Sans Pareil; from 16 January 1809 <span class="italic">Commodore Pennant</span>, a compilation similar to <span class="italic">The Melange</span>, ran at his Music Rooms, 125 Strand. Dibdin's voice had gone, his songs were not among his finest, and the public were no longer interested; bankruptcy followed.<br>
<br>On 12 April 1810 a public dinner with music raised &pound;640, of which &pound;80 was paid to Dibdin at once and the rest was invested in annuities. Almost certainly some of the money given to him went to pay for a new six-volume edition of his <span class="italic">Professional Life</span>, of which only the first and second volumes were published; the new volumes exist in manuscript, and are concerned largely with the loss of his pension. He wrote and composed twelve songs for Charles Dignum's entertainment <span class="italic">The Eccentric Travellers</span> and, in 1811, another twelve &#145;expressly and exclusively&#146; for William Kitchner's <span class="italic">La Belle Assembl&eacute;e</span> magazine. His final play, <span class="italic">The Round Robin</span>, was produced at the Haymarket on 21 June 1811 but failed after two performances; however, it included his last important sea song, &#145;A Lass that Loves a Sailor&#146;.<br>
<br>Dibdin was paralysed by an unknown illness in 1813 and lingered at his home in Arlington Street, Camden Town, London, until 25 July 1814. He was survived by his wife and daughter, as well as by his sons from his relationship with Harriet Pitt. He was buried in St Martin's burial-ground, Camden Town, with a stanza of &#145;Tom Bowling&#146; inscribed on his gravestone.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Dibdin was undoubtedly unique in British entertainment in the eighteenth century and was arguably the first singer&#150;songwriter, presenting entertainments consisting of songs without any connecting structures. Had it not been for these table entertainments, he would have been remembered only in theatre footnotes. Refusals to provide personal details for biographers can be ascribed to his reluctance to see someone else making money from his endeavours, especially since he could publish his own version of his life. A full list of plays he wrote and/or composed is impossible, and even Dibdin himself was uncertain of the exact number.<br>
<br>Dibdin quarrelled with almost every theatre owner and promoter and was gradually excluded from virtually all outlets for major dramatic works; his career through the 1780s was one of a continuous lowering of musical standards. He was one of the first English composers to attempt to receive an adequate&#151;and copyrighted&#151;return from his compositions, especially those works for the theatre, and he strongly campaigned against composers being merely salaried employees rather than being treated as part of the creative process. At the start of Dibdin's career, even a great composer such as Thomas Arne might receive only &pound;50 for stage music. Arguments also arose over his understanding that song lyrics and poetry, sung and spoken English, were not the same thing, and that disregarding this greatly lowered the dramatic potential of theatre pieces. His own high concept of his abilities as a composer also led to arguments. That said, his early dramatic works show many highly progressive features, and he could have developed into one of the major English composers rather than the first important popular songwriter.<br>
<br>Dibdin's solo table entertainments proved the ideal means of combining all his many talents. His songs greatly expanded the scope of the earlier English ballad, and this&#151;plus the serious, humorous, and dialect songs, introductions, and asides&#151;laid the basis for much of what was to come later in music-halls and other forms of popular music. A substantial number of his songs are well written and composed, despite the rate at which they were produced. Much of their appeal lies in his statement that &#145;even in my comic songs, I have warmly inculcated morality; and, that I have brought prominently forward those men whose valour has insured, and will perpetuate the glory of their country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Professional Life</span>, 3.42) and in his ability to write simple but memorable melodies. Approximately 100 of his more than 900 songs were sea songs, including important works such as &#145;Poor Jack&#146;, &#145;Tom Bowling&#146;, &#145;Push the Grog About&#146;, &#145;True Courage&#146; (1798), and &#145;Every Inch a Sailor&#146; (1789). Many of his sea and army songs concentrate on positive aspects of service rather than the distressing conditions under which men actually served, and much of the popularity of his songs reflected his honest belief in the sailor's and soldier's value to their country. Other songs celebrate the countryside and its pursuits, as well as events and fashions of the day. These songs undoubtedly became an important part of the folk tradition, although they would not have been collected since the composer was known. They generally portray an idealized Britain, especially of the period between 1788 and 1806, and continued to be used two hundred years after Dibdin's time by broadcasters, film-makers, and recording artists seeking to evoke his period. Manuscripts of his songs may be found at the British Library, the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, and at the University of Leeds.<br>
