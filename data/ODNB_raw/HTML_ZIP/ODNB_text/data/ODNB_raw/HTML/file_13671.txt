</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hood,  Alexander</span>, Viscount Bridport  (1726&#150;1814), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born on 2 December 1726, second son of Samuel Hood (<i>d</i>. 1777), vicar of Butleigh, Somerset, and Mary, daughter of Richard Hoskins of Beaminster, Dorset. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13678/', "Samuel Hood (later Viscount Hood)")</script>, who also entered the Royal Navy, Alexander preceding him by a few months, the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Captain Thomas Smith.<h2>
<a name="Earlynavalandparliamentarycareer"></a>Early naval and parliamentary career</h2>Hood was entered on 19 January 1741 as captain's servant to Smith in the <i>Romney</i>, in which he remained with Captain Thomas Grenville until 22 April 1743, when he transferred to the <i>Princess Mary</i>, again with Smith, who rated him midshipman. He followed Smith to the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (December 1744), the <i>Exeter</i> (March 1745), and the <i>Hawk</i> (May 1746); from her he was promoted lieutenant on 2 December to the <i>Bridgewater</i> in which he remained until she was paid off in October 1748.<br>
<br>Hood remained on half pay until January 1755 when he was appointed lieutenant in the <i>Prince</i> (Captain Charles Saunders); he was then (23 March 1756) appointed to the command of the sloop <i>Merlin</i>, fitting in the River Thames, and subsequently (10 June) was made post captain in the <i>Prince George</i>, in which Saunders, now a rear-admiral, hoisted his flag and proceeded to the Mediterranean station as second-in-command. Hood remained Saunders's flag captain for the next two years, following him successively to the <i>Prince</i>, the <i>Culloden</i>, and the <i>St George</i>. Following his return to England, on 5 January 1759 Hood was appointed to the frigate <i>Minerva</i>, attached to the fleet off Brest under Sir Edward Hawke, whence she was placed in October and November in a small squadron commanded by Captain Robert Duff cruising on the Morbihan coast of Brittany. In the latter month the squadron was chased by the French fleet, which was then itself pursued by Hawke and defeated on 20 November 1759 in Quiberon Bay where Hood was present. He remained with the Channel Fleet for two more years, distinguishing himself on 23 January 1761 in the Bay of Biscay when the <i>Minerva</i> fell in with the <i>Warwick</i>, a British 60-gun ship captured by the French in 1756 and now used as a transport. Although reduced in her armament, the <i>Warwick's</i> size and scantling posed a challenge to the 32-gun frigate, and indeed the contest proved roughly equal. In an engagement lasting six hours, each ship lost two of three masts, and each had about forty-six dead and wounded. But, to Hood's credit, the <i>Warwick</i> was captured.<br>
<br>In summer 1761 Hood married Mary, known as Molly (<i>c</i>.1706&#150;1786), daughter of Richard West, prebendary of Winchester; her mother was Maria, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, connected to the Lyttelton and Grenville families. Lord Lyttelton gave away the bride. Mary was twenty years older than Hood, but the match proved a happy one and his genuine tenderness to this &#145;glorious girl&#146; was touching  (Wyndham, 2.278). That August, Lord Anson, first lord of the Admiralty, honoured Hood by taking the <i>Minerva</i> with him in a small squadron that escorted Princess Charlotte, the future queen, on her sea crossing from Mecklenburg to Harwich. In September 1761 Hood transferred to the <i>Africa</i> (64 guns), launched the previous month, in which he served in the Mediterranean until the peace in 1763. In December 1763 he was appointed to the royal yacht <i>Katherine</i>, a command he retained until December 1777. His income was supplemented from 23 September 1766 when he succeeded Sir Charles Saunders as treasurer of Greenwich Hospital. The fortune of his wife, which Hood insisted she retain, and his several incomes permitted the couple to maintain a country house, Cricket Lodge at Cricket St Thomas, near Chard, Somerset, and a house in Harley Street, London.<br>
<br>In December 1777 Hood was appointed to the <i>Robust</i> (74 guns). On 27 July of the following year she formed one of Vice-Admiral Sir Hugh Palliser's rear division of the fleet under Admiral Augustus Keppel which indecisively engaged the French off Ushant. The ensuing controversy, involving courts martial of both Keppel and Palliser, almost ruined Hood's career, for at Keppel's trial he was forced to admit that he had directed the log book of the <i>Robust</i> to be altered, by the insertion of signal, after the court martial was ordered. Hood made the perfectly reasonable assertion that the book had been written up carelessly and that his additions, which were not suspicious, merely improved and corrected the master's rough draft. Other log books had also been amended and the court did not condemn the insertion. George III was also inclined to put a favourable interpretation on the alteration: he recalled Hood had hitherto<blockquote>always borne the character of a man of strict honour. I therefore trust the affair will be explained and that his conduct will rather be proved to have been actuated by over-niceness than any inclination to alter the complexion of a document. (Hood, 47&#150;8)</blockquote>But the public noise in favour of Keppel was vociferous; Hood was hissed in court and the word &#145;hooded&#146; for a short while meant being subject to false evidence.<br>
<br>To restore his reputation after the court martial Hood appealed in February 1779 either for promotion or for a colonelcy of marines, his wife and brother adding their weight to his request. The &#145;most friendly act&#146; Lord Sandwich, first lord of the Admiralty, felt he could do was to order the <i>Robust</i> to the North American station. But, determined to face hostile opinion at home, Hood resigned his command of the <i>Robust</i>, and was re-appointed to the royal yacht <i>Katherine</i>. He was promoted rear-admiral on 26 September 1780 but it was another two years before he was appointed to a real command, following the death of Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt, in the Channel Fleet under Lord Howe. He hoisted his flag on the <i>Queen</i> (90 guns) and took part in the final relief of Gibraltar and the subsequent skirmish with the Franco-Spanish fleet off Cape Spartel, on 19 October 1782.<br>
<br>At the general election in 1784, under the patronage of the fourth Earl Poulett, Hood was elected member for Bridgwater. He spoke in parliament for the first time on 23 June 1784, and thereafter on three or four other occasions, all on naval matters. He voted with the government on the regency question, but abandoned his seat in 1790 on failing to agree terms with his patron. He was nevertheless re-elected for Buckingham in December 1790, and represented that constituency until 1796, though virtually without utterance, by the influence of the marquess of Buckingham, to whom he was related through his first wife, Mary. She had died in 1786 and on 4 May 1788 he married Maria Sophia (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1831), daughter of Thomas Bray of Edmonton. He had been promoted vice-admiral on 24 September 1787, and three days after his second marriage he was nominated a knight of the Bath.<h2>
<a name="Commanderatsea"></a>Commander at sea</h2>During the Spanish armament of 1790 Hood hoisted his flag for a short while on the <i>London</i> at Spithead. However, significant further service only recommenced in February 1793 when he was appointed third in command of the Channel Fleet under Lord Howe and hoisted his flag on the <i>Royal George</i>. He was promoted admiral on 24 April 1794; and for his part in the battle of 1 June 1794 he was created Baron Bridport in the Irish peerage (two years later he was created Baron Bridport of Cricket St Thomas in the peerage of Great Britain). Following the battle Bridport became second in command of the Channel Fleet; and from mid-1795, when Howe's weakening health obliged the Admiralty to permit him to command from on shore, Bridport took the fleet to sea in the invidious position of responsibility without power. On 12 June he sailed in escort of the British expedition to support a royalist rising in Brittany, parting company from the troop convoy and escort under Sir John Borlase Warren close to Belle &Icirc;le. The French fleet was reported to have left Brest, and it was sighted by Warren off Belle &Icirc;le; taking evasive action, Warren immediately sent word to Bridport who sighted the French fleet on 22 June. Villaret-Joyeuse, the French admiral, had only twelve of the line; Bridport, with Warren's ships of the line, a potential seventeen. Bridport gave chase, and on 23 June, Isle de Groix east 6 or 7 miles, captured three French battleships before Villaret-Joyeuse took refuge in Lorient.<br>
<br>Since Howe had been forced ashore to recuperate from the battle of 1 June, Bridport had revealed jealousy of the favourable treatment of his commander-in-chief who was only a year older than himself and with whom he did not enjoy a close relationship. Bridport too had health problems, complaining in 1794 of gout. To retain Howe as nominal commander-in-chief, yet to reward and encourage Bridport for remaining at sea, in July 1795 Earl Spencer, first lord of the Admiralty, proposed the latter be appointed commander-in-chief of a squadron to be employed on a particular service, which carried higher emoluments. Bridport reported honestly that the new commission, which he thought overdue, failed to arouse in him either a sense of honour or feeling of gratitude, and that he still expected some further mark of royal approbation for his services. Irritating to Spencer, the reply prompted George III to observe that his remarks revealed Bridport's true priorities; &#145;in his family self value is so predominant that all other objects are not sufficiently attended to&#146;  (to Spencer, 16 Aug 1795, <span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.380). Yet the arrangement proved unsatisfactory. Remaining overall commander-in-chief, Howe still shared in prize money even though he served on shore, while Bridport, probably deliberately, failed to keep him informed of his proceedings. The new commission was suspended in October and Bridport retired on shore on half pay.<br>
<br>Bridport did not again volunteer his services until October 1796, when Spencer was ready to employ him. Under the necessity to defend the Quiberon expedition from interference, the close blockade of Brest and Lorient had begun in June 1795. Since then detachments of the British fleet had relieved one another on station off Brest and this arrangement remained adequate throughout autumn 1796, though enhanced activity in the port steadily raised the demand for larger scale deterrence. In a move that coincided with the reinforcement of the Brest fleet from Rochefort, Bridport rehoisted his flag on 18 December 1796, though still nominally under the shore command of Howe. The French expedition to Ireland had sailed two days earlier; on 20 December the Admiralty dispatched orders to Bridport to put to sea from Spithead; an easterly wind and adverse tide contributed to collisions involving five ships on 25 December and eventually he sailed on 3 January 1797. However, though he remained at sea for a month, Bridport contributed little directly to the failure of the French expedition which returned into port on 13 January, having lost a quarter of its force through foundering, grounding, or capture by frigates.<h2>
<a name="TheSpitheadmutinyandtheblockadeofBrest"></a>The Spithead mutiny and the blockade of Brest</h2>Following a brief cruise in March 1797 Bridport was at Spithead on 15 April when, on account of discontent in Ireland and intelligence of preparations in Brest, the fleet was ordered to make ready for sea and the seamen of the fleet, led by those in the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, refused to unmoor. The Spithead mutiny took Bridport by surprise. In March the seamen had sent petitions to Howe who had referred them to Lord Hugh Seymour in the fleet; he had assured Howe that there was no general sign of discontent and sent the petitions to the Board of Admiralty where they had been ignored. Rather the board simply hoped that officers of the fleet would take steps to nip the mutiny in the bud. This placed the responsibility on Bridport, for Howe had finally resigned as commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet on 8 April. Bridport was angry that measures had not been taken earlier to pacify the men; he also realized the scale of the mutiny and the impossibility of forcing the seamen to sail against their will. He accordingly ignored directions to proceed to sea and committed the Admiralty to answer the petitions. That answer was noncommittal, and as further petitions reached him, he placed responsibility squarely with the board to state to the seamen precisely how their grievances were being answered.<br>
<br>In the ensuing negotiations Bridport consistently took the part of the mutineers. After the board migrated to Portsmouth to settle matters on the spot and seamen's delegates met on Bridport's flagship, the <i>Royal George</i>, on 21 April he was obliged to strike his flag. But on 23 April he was able to report to the mutineers that their demands had been conceded and he was permitted that day to rehoist his flag. At this time six ships became operational and dropped down to St Helens, the outer anchorage. However, further demands promptly emerged from them; before sailing the seamen also wished to secure the concessions they had won. Following Bridport's example, Spencer was willing to keep the seamen informed of the progress made in meeting their requirements. By 6 May order seemed to have been re-established. Yet again discontent revived, the St Helens ships refusing to sail without confirmation of the funds granted by the House of Commons towards their increased pay and provisions. Evidence of this was sent down from London. Bridport ensured its acceptability by insisting that the date the increases would take effect should be not the date set in London by order in council, but that which he had used in negotiating with the seamen. He also insisted that officers opposed by the men be replaced by others and that authority in ships be restored before he took the fleet to sea. He graciously accepted the diplomatic mediating mission of Howe, through whose reassurances the mutiny was finally settled by 15 May. The delegates expressed to Bridport their gratitude for his &#145;open and generous manner&#146; and for the &#145;humanity&#146; with which he employed his authority. Their letters of thanks were retained in his personal papers.<br>
<br>Bridport did not arouse similar feelings either at the Admiralty or with some of his officers. Since mid-March 1797 Spencer had maintained the need to keep a more strict and systematic watch on the port of Brest. To more closely co-ordinate Falmouth-based frigate squadrons (hitherto reporting directly to the Admiralty) with the battle fleet operating from Spithead, in May 1797 the frigate squadron commanders, Sir John Borlase Warren and Sir Edward Pellew, were placed directly under Bridport's command. Both resented their loss of independence and found relations with Bridport difficult. At the same time, despite having the command of more frigates, Bridport denied being able to keep Brest under close watch, especially in easterly winds which drove blockading ships off shore while permitting the French to pass through the narrow neck of Brest harbour. He also wished to grant favoured captains cruising voyages within the limits of his command as a reward for past services while the Admiralty, short of ships and having to ration both frigates and ships of the line within every command, wished to understand and specify precisely the stations ships would fill, and have their captains keep those stations with absolute regularity. On other matters, such as officer appointments, the Board of Admiralty did what it could to satisfy him. But Bridport's dissatisfaction was by now accepted as characteristic: hence the secretary of the Admiralty observed in September 1797 he &#145;ought to be pleased, though he is never likely to be so&#146;  (Sir Evan Nepean to Spencer, 11 Sept 1797, BL, Althorp papers).<br>
<br>Bridport became more reconciled to more strict Admiralty control after March 1798 when discontent in Ireland and mass manning of ships in Brest appeared extremely threatening. Nevertheless he did not refrain from complaint at losses of ships to other stations or deficiencies of flag officers. While short of ships, he denied an ability to defend convoys passing through the mouth of the channel while also blockading Brest. Undoubtedly after May 1798 he felt the strain of having to maintain station off Ushant. His correspondence with the Admiralty became acrimonious; he had a reputation at the Admiralty for putting &#145;a stronger and unfavourable construction on some things than they were meant to convey&#146;  (Bridport to unknown Admiralty commissioner, 2 July 1798, BL, Add. MS 35199). In the event, the blockade failed to prevent French ships sailing for Ireland from Rochefort in August and from Brest in September. Moreover, though seven of the nine vessels that escaped from Brest were captured, the credit did not fall to Bridport, most being taken by ships under the commander-in-chief on the Irish coast. A third expedition sailed from Rochefort in October but, on learning the fate of its predecessors, it returned safely into Rochefort.<br>
<br>Through winter 1798&#150;9 the blockade was reduced to squadrons, occasionally even fewer ships, and Bridport remained on shore. He returned to sail from Spithead on 13 April 1799 and was off Ushant when, under the cover of fog, Vice-Admiral Eustache Bruix with eighteen ships of the line slipped out of Brest, was reinforced from Lorient, and sailed for the Mediterranean. The threat of the loose fleet was momentarily exacerbated by an obvious <i>ruse de guerre</i> contained in messages captured on 27 April on the French lugger <i>Black Joke</i>. By now elaborate instructions were in place for the defence of Ireland, while reinforcements were sent to the Mediterranean. Yet it was not until 10 May that the Admiralty knew for certain that Bruix had gone south. He did little harm in the Mediterranean, but was able to unite with his fleet Spanish squadrons from both Cartagena and Cadiz which in July returned north. After leave on shore Bridport took station off Brest but could not prevent the re-entry of an enemy fleet of forty ships of the line.<br>
<br>During autumn 1799 Bridport presided over thirty-two ships of the line off Brest; in March 1800 he was directed to keep twenty-eight always with him. Inshore the blockade by frigates focused as much on preventing the entry of stores as on the departure of warships. With the necessity to maintain the largest possible Channel Fleet at sea, the emphasis in maintenance and victualling had shifted from Portsmouth to Plymouth. Special efforts were made to improve victualling arrangements, especially to the fleet anchorage in Torbay. These included the provision of fresh vegetables and lemon juice, issued since 1796, to deter scurvy. The disease was not entirely beaten. Because lemon juice was still issued only as a cure, scurvy continued to break out, as much a psychological worry for fleet commanders as a physical problem.<br>
<br>In April 1800 severe weather drove Bridport into Torbay and he took the opportunity to strike his flag for the final time. He was by then seventy-three and had for some time been feeling frail. He nevertheless lived until 2 May 1814. He was still not favoured by George III, but in justice was honoured by his advancement in 1800 to the dignity of viscount in the peerage of Great Britain. His titles in the peerage of Great Britain became extinct at his death, but his Irish barony descended to his great-nephew.<br>
