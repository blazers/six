<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Herle,  Charles</span>  (1597/8&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and political theorist</span>, was born at Prideaux Herle, near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, the third of six sons of Edward Herle of Prideaux and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Treffry. On 23 October 1612, aged fourteen, he matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford. He graduated BA on 7 July 1615 and proceeded MA on 10 June 1618. Perhaps owing to ancestral connections with Lancashire, he subsequently became a tutor to James Stanley, Lord Strange. In 1625 he was instituted rector of Creed, Cornwall, but on 27 June 1626, following presentation by Sir Thomas Stanley, he was instituted rector of Winwick, Lancashire. It is not clear how soon he took up residence in this potentially rich benefice: the parsonage was still in the occupation of the widow of his predecessor, who had been locked in long-running litigation over some of its income, and Herle too became embroiled in this until the dispute was resolved two or three years later. In the meantime, while serving as chaplain in the household of Elizabeth Stanley, countess of Derby, he wrote her will, dated 19 February 1627; she died at Richmond, Surrey, on 10 March, and was subsequently buried at Westminster Abbey, so it seems likely that Herle spent some time in and around London at this period.<br>
<br>A &#145;long and hopelesse sickness&#146;, and &#145;the weary houres&#146; of recuperation, gave rise to Herle's first publication, <span class="italic">Contemplations and devotions on the severall passages of our blessed Saviours death and passion</span> (1631). In dedicating the work to Strange, to whom he attributed his recovery, Herle explained that his aims were to vindicate protestantism from the Catholic charge that &#145;she spends all her devotion on the Pulpit, and keepes none for the Closet&#146;  (sig. A5<i>v</i>). The meditations, arranged in twenty-seven sections, ran from Jesus's &#145;bloudy sweat in the Garden&#146; to the involvement of Joseph and Nicodemus with the burial of his body, in a manner resembling the stations of the cross. By this time Herle had married and was living in Winwick; his wife was possibly called Margaret. He had ten children, including Edward (<i>b</i>. 1632), Henry (<i>b</i>. 1633), Charles, and Anne, who in 1652 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67399/', "John Dubois")</script> and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8113/', "Charles Dubois")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1642 Herle and his three curates took the protestation oath, and on the outbreak of war found themselves in opposition to Derby's and Strange's powerful local interest. When Warrington was garrisoned for the king, Herle took refuge in London; in his absence his parsonage was fortified by Sir John Fortescue, a Catholic, though it subsequently changed hands according to the fortunes of war in the area. Apparently on the initiative of John Moore, MP for Liverpool, who that spring had helped organize resistance to Strange in Lancashire, on 26 October the Commons voted to invite Herle to preach before them at St Margaret's, Westminster. The resulting fast sermon, delivered on 30 November, and published as <span class="italic">A Payre of Compasses for Church and State</span> (1642), revealed high approval for the institution he addressed: &#145;good Parliaments have alwayes beene observ'd to be like sharpe searching Frosts, which sound bodies like, as the healthiest weather; but such as are rotten, feare as too subtle and searching for their conscious prognosticke bones&#146;  (p. 10). His theme was truth and peace. Since &#145;that iron chayne of meere necessity is too short&#146; and &#145;men's lives are God's, and may not be adventured upon any other warrant or end then God's&#146;  (p. 41), war was not to be undertaken lightly, but without truth, &#145;true peace cannot be had&#146;  (p. 14). Rejecting the Machiavellian counsel of balancing threats and divisions, he advocated concerted action against three categories of errors of ascending seriousness: the diversive errors of the &#145;Inconformists&#146; or separatists, the perversive errors of the Arminians, and the subversive errors of the papists. The first were to be dealt with by argument, the second by burning their books, and the third by securing their persons.<br>
<br>Herle was soon engaged in pamphlet controversy. Taking up the themes in Charles I's <span class="italic">Answer to the Nineteen Propositions</span> of June 1642, royal chaplain Henry Ferne published in November as <span class="italic">The Resolving of Conscience</span> a defence of the king's position. By 29 December, when George Thomason obtained a copy and named its author, Herle had issued anonymously <span class="italic">A Fuller Answer to a Treatise Written by Dr Fearne</span>. In it he advanced three propositions: that a &#145;Parliament of England may with good conscience, in defence of King, Laws, and Government establisht, when imminently endangered &hellip; take up Armes without, and against the Kings personal commands, if he refuse&#146;; that the final arbiters of whether such a situation had arisen were the two houses of parliament; and that the people were &#145;to rest&#146; with parliament's judgement &#145;and in obedience thereto may with good conscience, in defence of the King, Lawes, and Government, beare and use Armes&#146;  (p. 2). Explaining that &#145;Englands is not a simply subordinative, and absolute, but a Coordinative, and mixt Monarchy&#146;  (p. 3), Herle went further than contemporary theorist Philip Hunton, whose position was in many respects similar, in exploring what would happen if co-operation between king and parliament, ideally equals in law making, broke down. Drawing on the idea of the king's two bodies, he propounded &#145;the ingenious formula of the king's virtual presence at Westminster&#146;  (Weston and Greenberg, 56) to cover his assent to parliamentary legislation. Herle complemented this in the second week of January 1643 with <span class="italic">An Answer to Mis-Led Dr Ferne According to his Own Method</span>, an extremely allusive point-by-point refutation drawing on wide historical precedent. Ferne's rejoinder, <span class="italic">Conscience Satisfied</span>, appeared in mid-April, and Herle's <span class="italic">An Answer to Dr Fernes Reply</span> by 17 May. Developing his theory of co-ordination to a position nearer to William Prynne's than Hunton's, Herle awarded parliament &#145;close to a monopoly&#146;  (ibid., 55) in the making and execution of laws.<br>
<br>On 17 February the Commons approved Herle as a Thursday afternoon lecturer in a new church at Tothill Fields, Westminster; he also gave a regular morning lecture at the abbey church and some time between 1642 and 1644 was a minister at St Olave, Southwark. Gaining in eminence, by the summer he was being spoken of in the same breath as Edmund Calamy and Stephen Marshall, and like them appeared to have gained the trust of the men around John Pym in parliament. On 15 June he encouraged the house with a fast sermon published as <span class="italic">Davids Song of Three Parts</span> (1643); five days later he was named with Calamy and Obadiah Sedgwick to license books of divinity. Nominated with William Heyrick to represent Lancashire in the Westminster assembly, he was placed on its grand committee on 29 September. Active, influential, and apparently clear-thinking, he soon emerged as one of the leading presbyterians but, although he consistently adopted a Reformed position in both doctrine and ecclesiology, his approach in debate was generally conciliatory. Earlier that year in <span class="italic">The Independency on Scriptures of the Independency of Churches</span> he had argued &#145;temperately&#146; not against the Independents' contention that church government should be biblically based, which he entirely shared, but against their interpretation of what that government should be. In the assembly he supported a full exploration of their arguments, and sometimes ranged himself on their side in discussion, while in due course he authorized the publication of the Independent <span class="italic">An Apologeticall Narration</span>.<br>
<br>His political commitment was uncompromising, however. In <span class="italic">The Convinced Petitioner</span>, issued on 13 January 1644, he rejected a return to pre-war policy:<blockquote>when absolute prerogative gets upon the Throne, and the Pope upon the Church, what subjects then but slaves? what Christians but Papists? &hellip; no peace is to be had, but either we must fight for it in hope of victory, or purchase it by perpetuall slavery. (p. 15)</blockquote>The undoubted sacrifice demanded in prosecuting the war further, and the reward from God, was outlined in <span class="italic">Abrahams Offer Gods Offering</span> (1644), preached before the lord mayor on Easter Tuesday. In the preface to <span class="italic">Ahab's Fall by his Prophets Flatteries</span> (1644), a collection of three sermons on the same text, including one at the abbey church, &#145;where it was much acquarrelled by some&#146;, Herle rather unsuccessfully disclaimed his critics' construction that &#145;what is spoken of King Ahab and Jezebel&#146; was &#145;any way to be meant of our dread Soveraigne and his Consort&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>), although he placed much emphasis on legality. Implicit in an appendix, <span class="italic">A Short Answer, by Way of a Postscript, to Dr Ferne's Last Reply</span>, was again the power invested in parliament to act without the king. <span class="italic">Davids Reserve and Rescue</span> (1645), preached to the Commons on 5 November 1644, celebrated freedom from tyranny.<br>
<br>On 22 July 1646 Herle was elected prolocutor of the assembly in succession to William Twisse, but by this time, his parish being securely in parliamentarian hands, he seems to have been periodically in Lancashire. His ties had never been entirely broken: in autumn 1644 he had administered collections made in London for the relief of distress caused by war in the county, while in December that year a parliamentary ordinance enabled him and other ministers to conduct ordinations there. When on 2 October 1646 Lancashire was divided into nine classical presbyteries, Herle's name headed the list of those in the fourth classis. On 25 December Robert Baillie, who as one of the Scottish commissioners at the assembly had not always approved Herle's contribution, perhaps surprisingly placed him first in a list sent to the earl of Loudoun of the ablest English clergy suitable to serve as royal chaplains. In 1647 Herle, with Marshall, accompanied the parliamentary commissioners on their mission to Scotland. In January that year one Margaret Herle was buried in Westminster Abbey; if this was his wife, Herle married again within a few months, for his daughter Mary was baptized at Winwick on 3 September 1648.<br>
<br>The king's execution in January 1649 seems to have been a watershed, however, and the event which persuaded Herle to leave London permanently and perhaps to alter his political stance. Retiring to Winwick, he faced two years of litigation with Fortescue. He cannot initially have enjoyed easy relations with the earl of Derby, who claimed to be the patron when tithes were calculated in 1650, but it seems that the breach was later healed. As the royalist army passed through Lancashire in August 1651 he took some of its wounded soldiers into his house and seems to have been among the local presbyterian ministers who made overtures to Derby while he was occupying Wigan for the king. Rumours were circulating in the Warrington area that Herle and his son had armed themselves and followed the royal forces, and even that Herle was a royalist spy. Probably shortly after the royalist defeat at Worcester on 3 September, Herle was among a group of distinguished Lancashire ministers arrested on suspicion of correspondence with the king and taken to Liverpool. Plague later led to their removal to Ormskirk, but their imprisonment seems to have been relatively short and their rehabilitation fairly rapid. In the summer of 1652 Herle played the leading role in the ordination at Winwick of John Howe, later domestic chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, and in 1654 he was appointed an assistant to the Lancashire commission of triers and ejectors.<br>
<br>Herle's final publications indicate a detachment from political matters. <span class="italic">Wordly policy and moral prudence, the vanity and folly of the one, the solidity and usefulnesse of the other</span> (1654) was a self-proclaimed &#145;moral discourse&#146; advancing different aspects of personal integrity. <span class="italic">Wisdomes Tripos</span> (1655) added a third discussion, on Christian wisdom; conventionally pious, its only engagement with topical issues was to lament the &#145;Academy of Atheisme&#146; which &#145;goes up apace &hellip; in these times&#146;  (p. 52). Herle died in late September 1659, and was buried on 29 September in the chancel of his church at Winwick.<br>
