<span class="headword">Witney,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1292&#150;1342), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, is first recorded working as a mason on the building of St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Palace in 1292&#150;3 and 1294. He probably came from Witney, Oxfordshire, a manor of the bishop of Winchester, which may have been significant for his career. By 1311 Thomas and his wife, Margery, were living in Winchester and they acquired 6 acres of meadow at Michelmersh, 7 or 8 miles west of the city, which in November 1313 Witney granted to the cathedral priory, perhaps as a premium for a corrody. Some time between 1309 and 1327, a &#145;Master T. de W.&#146; entered into an indenture with the prior and convent concerning the repair of the presbytery of the cathedral church. This must be Witney, for the feretory bay, with the eastern arcade and feretory screen, can be attributed to him on the strength of detailed comparisons with his documented work at Exeter Cathedral.<br>
<br>A &#145;Master Thomas de Winton&#146;, who is assumed to have been Witney, visited Exeter in June 1313 to advise on timber for a new bishop's throne. On the strength of comparisons with more securely attributed work, the details of the surviving throne suggest that Witney was its designer. By Michaelmas 1316 he was master mason at Exeter Cathedral and until 1324 he was provided with a rent-free house. He also advised on the repair of the king's castle in the city, serving as one of two viewers of the works in 1323 and 1324. In the cathedral he was responsible for completing the crossing and building the nave, for the reredos and sedilia (1316&#150;25), and for the pulpitum (1318&#150;25), all of which share design features and moulding profiles. His work reveals on the one hand a pragmatic responsiveness to the existing fabric and, on the other, great originality in the design of vaults and tracery and in the manipulation of geometrical forms on different scales.<br>
<br>Witney's fees of &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a year were paid until Michaelmas 1342, but by 1347 he had been succeeded by William Joy. In 1328 or 1329 the bishop of Exeter, John Grandison (<i>d</i>. 1369), wrote to the prior of Winchester to obtain for Witney payment of a daily corrody and yearly pension which were due to him and in arrears. Grandison described him as a &#145;dearly loved member of our household and a valuable and willing servant to us and to our church of Exeter&#146;  (Harvey and Oswald, 339); and next year wrote to the abbot and convent of Sherborne to commend to them a young man called J. Sparkeforde, the son of Master Thomas Witney, &#145;whose industry is of special value for the repair and in part new building, by his skill, of the fabric of our church of Exeter&#146;  (Harvey and Oswald, 340).<br>
<br>It has been argued on stylistic grounds that Witney was also the designer of the octagonal lady chapel in Wells Cathedral, which was in existence by May 1326 and probably built in the immediately preceding years. The innovative star vault and the tracery pattern recall aspects of his work in these fields at Exeter. As supporting circumstantial evidence, a &#145;Thomas le Masun&#146;, who may have been Witney, witnessed a document with members of the Wells chapter in 1323 and, in 1327, was a well-to-do resident in the town. By 1329 William Joy had been appointed master mason at Wells Cathedral. That Joy may also have succeeded Witney at Winchester, and certainly did so at Exeter, perhaps suggests a professional partnership. On stylistic grounds (vault patterns and tracery designs), Witney and/or Joy may also have worked at Malmesbury Abbey.<br>
<br>The documentary and architectural evidence gives an unusually full picture, for the period concerned, of a master mason and his practice. In a career of at least fifty years, Thomas Witney was responsible for some of the most original building of the English Decorated period in the south and west of England.<br>
