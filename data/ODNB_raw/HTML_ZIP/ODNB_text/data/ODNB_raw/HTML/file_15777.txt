<span class="headword">Knowlton,  Thomas</span>  (1691&#150;1781), <span class="occ">gardener and botanist</span>, was born at Chislehurst, Kent, and baptized there on 6 September 1691, the eldest of the five sons of William Knowlton and Ann Stokes. Little is known of his early life. In 1720 he was employed as a gardener by Sir Henry Penrice (1677&#150;1752) at Offaly Palace, Hertfordshire. In the same year, on 27 June, he married Elizabeth Rice (<i>d</i>. 1738). They had two children, Elizabeth and Charles, the latter of whom attended St John's College, Cambridge, and pursued a career in the church. After leaving Penrice's service Knowlton superintended the botanic garden of Dr James Sherard at Eltham in Kent. After a short time working for the duke of Chandos in Canons he entered the service of Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, at Londesborough, Yorkshire, and there he remained for the rest of his life. His freelance work at other estates in Yorkshire appears to have made him a wealthy man, and he invested his profits in property. <br>
<br>Knowlton became known as a botanist of merit. He corresponded with E. M. Da Costa and other members of the Royal Society, and won the esteem of Sir Hans Sloane. He subscribed to Mark Catesby's <span class="italic">History of Carolina</span> and actively encouraged others to do the same. To him is due the first discovery in England of the &#145;moor-ball&#146;, a species of fresh-water algae of the Conferva family, called by Linnaeus <i>Aegagropila</i>. In order to find even a moderate number of these balls, he had to spend many hours wading in the lake at Walling Fen, in water from 2 to over 3 feet deep.<br>
<br>Knowlton was also something of an antiquary. He discovered the exact site of the ancient city of Delgovicia, near Pocklington in Yorkshire, and communicated some observations on this and other subjects to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (44, 1748, 100&#150;102, 124&#150;7). Two large deer's horns which he discovered, one resembling the horn of an Irish elk, are figured in the same volume (plate 422). He was at first distinguished by his interest in and knowledge of indigenous plants. In 1726 he travelled to Guernsey to study the cultivation of the Guernsey lily. He became increasingly interested in exotic species, for which he first built a hot house at Londesborough in 1729.<br>
<br>Knowlton died on 28 November 1781 at Londesborough. Toward the end of his life he was totally blind. He was buried in Londesborough churchyard. The genus <i>Knowltonia</i> (Ranunculaceae), now subsumed into <i>Anemone</i>, was named after him by Richard Anthony Salisbury in 1796. A John Knowlton, gardener to Earl Fitzwilliam, whose will was proved in February 1782  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1087, sig. 85), was perhaps a brother of the botanist.<br>
