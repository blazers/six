<span class="headword">Otterbourne,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1420), <span class="occ">historian</span>, has often been confused with his older namesake, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50581/', "Thomas Otterbourne (fl. c.1340&#150;1346)")</script>. He was the author of a chronicle which was edited and printed by Thomas Hearne in 1732. Hearne discussed the evidence for the existence of a chronicler called Otterbourne, and cited the opinion of Thomas Tanner (<i>d</i>. 1735) that there were two chroniclers of this name. Tanner was almost certainly correct, but very little is known about the life of the second Thomas Otterbourne. He may be tentatively identified with the Thomas Otterbourne who was presented to the living of Haddiscoe, Norfolk, on 30 October 1383 and became rector of Chingford, Essex, in 1393. The family of Ros of Helmsley were the patrons of the living of Chingford, and this perhaps strengthens the assumption that, like his namesake, he was a native of north-east England. If so, he was perhaps the Thomas Otterbourne of Yorkshire who acted as a mainpernor for a number of different people several times between 1379 and 1382.<br>
<br>Otterbourne's chronicle exists in a fifteenth-century manuscript, BL, Harley MS 3643; a transcript (which differs only in a few details from the fifteenth-century manuscript) was made in the sixteenth century: this survives as BL, Cotton MS Vitellius F.ix. Hearne's edition was based on this latter manuscript, which was damaged in the fire of 1731. John Stow, working in the later sixteenth century, translated the sections of the chronicle that cover the Anglo-Saxon period and the years from 1400 to 1420: his translation survives as BL, Harley MS 6223, folios 122<i>r</i>&#150;141<i>r</i>.<br>
<br>Although the chronicle starts with the legendary history of Britain, it provides detailed information only for the years from 1377 to 1420, when it ends. Even here, it is largely dependent on a manuscript of Thomas Walsingham's chronicle. V. H. Galbraith noted that nine-tenths of Otterbourne's text for the reigns of Henry IV (from 1406) and Henry V consists of &#145;word for word extracts&#146; from Walsingham, and his account of Richard II's reign and the early years of Henry IV's is also substantially derived from Walsingham. Virtually all the rest of Otterbourne's material for Henry V's life and reign, including the story of the dauphin's gift of tennis balls to Henry, comes from the <span class="italic">Liber metricus</span> of Thomas Elmham. A few passages in the later part of his chronicle appear to be derived from other sources. His account of how Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland, met his death in 1392 seems to be independent of Walsingham, and his description of the siege of Berwick by Henry IV during the uprising of 1405 has a few details that do not derive from any known source. This may be further evidence for the author's north-eastern origins, though most of his coverage of northern affairs from 1377 onwards is derived from Walsingham.<br>
<br>Otterbourne can be regarded as an independent source for only a very small number of the events he describes, and he himself freely acknowledges his debt to others. In the introduction to his chronicle, he says that his work consists of extracts transcribed from other chronicles, for the benefit of those &#145;who do not possess many chronicles or cannot read those they have&#146;  (Hearne, 3). He explicitly acknowledges his dependence on Geoffrey of Monmouth, Bede, William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, Roger of Howden, and &#145;Cestrensis polichronicon&#146; (Ranulf Higden), but he does not admit to any borrowing from Walsingham. Although his chronicle survives while that of his namesake has been preserved only as a shadow behind the Lanercost chronicle, there can be little doubt that the first Thomas Otterbourne was a historian of much more significance than the second.<br>
