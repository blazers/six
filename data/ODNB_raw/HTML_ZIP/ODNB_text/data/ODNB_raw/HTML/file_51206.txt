<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McFadzean,  Francis Scott</span>, Baron McFadzean of Kelvinside  (1915&#150;1992), <span class="occ">businessman and economist</span>, was born on 26 November 1915 at 8 Fullarton Terrace, Troon, Ayrshire, the son of Francis Findlay McFadzean, law clerk, and his wife, Annie Scott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Frank, as he was always known, developed early on a broad accent, and qualities of forthrightness and decisiveness which he never lost. He left school at the age of fourteen to go to sea and pursue the romance of travel and hazard, but after four years of washing down decks and painting hulls he reviewed his progress and made his first career change. Three months of intensive study in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, saw him pass the entry examination for Glasgow University, where he took a first in economics and developed an appetite and talent for intellectual debate. Later a postgraduate degree in business administration at the London School of Economics (LSE) completed his academic armoury. After a short spell as a civil servant, from 1938 to 1940, in which his intellectual strength guided him through the Board of Trade into the Treasury, his career was interrupted by the Second World War. After joining the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry as a private he made his way through the ranks and through Africa, Italy, and north-west Europe finally to Malaya, where he was demobilized as a colonel.<br>
<br>McFadzean began his post-war career working with the Malayan government (1945&#150;9) and then with the Colonial Development Corporation (1949&#150;52). His strong opinions soon led him into direct conflict with Lord Reith, chairman of the latter, and their letters announcing a parting of the ways crossed in the post. McFadzean then joined the Royal Dutch-Shell group of companies, rising to become managing director of the group, a post he held from 1964 to 1976, and chairman of the committee of managing directors, from 1972 to 1976. He also chaired Shell Oil in the United States and Shell Canada. The years of his chairmanship were turbulent, with the first oil crisis in 1974 rewriting the rules for the oil industry. His resilience and decisiveness were called on heavily during these years, as they had been during the Nigerian crisis five years earlier, when he flew into the rebels' camp in Enugu to obtain the safe passage of his expatriates. On his return from Nigeria his preference for a low profile was exemplified by his whimsical willingness to speak only to the <span class="italic">Sunday Post</span>. He was knighted in 1975.<br>
<br>In 1976, shortly before his retirement from Shell, McFadzean was appointed chairman of British Airways by Harold Wilson. With typical clinical appreciation of his new situation he completed the integration of British European Airways and the British Overseas Airways Corporation, making considerable cost savings, but, even more importantly, winning the battle to build the airline around Boeing aircraft, a base which underpinned the airline's competitive position and secured its future. These years with British Airways took their toll on his health and led to his leaving the corporation in 1979. Nevertheless, in December 1979 he was persuaded by Margaret Thatcher, who much admired his acumen, to accept the chairmanship of Rolls-Royce (which he had previously served as a non-executive director). Rolls-Royce was in major financial difficulties when he arrived. The recession in the airline industry had deepened drastically in the early 1980s, following the second oil crisis, and orders had fallen by almost 75 per cent. McFadzean tackled effectively the cost implications of this without damaging the momentum of technological development. As a result Rolls-Royce kept its place in the front rank of engine suppliers and within three years was profitable again and ready for privatization. Like British Airways, Rolls-Royce, thanks to McFadzean (by now Baron McFadzean of Kelvinside), had got its fundamentals right.<br>
<br>McFadzean's determination to set his own course and break the shackles of a traditional and comfortable Scottish life emerged early, with his departure from home into the rough and tumble of life at sea. During these formative four years he gained confidence in the strength of his intellect, and realized that he needed to pursue education to develop and hone his mind. His studies and his mental jousting with Alec Cairncross and others did just that. This period of education in Glasgow and later at the LSE convinced him that he had something to offer in the academic field of economics. Perhaps he saw himself in the line of Adam Smith and the other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment. He certainly had the practical experience to contribute. Nevertheless, it was a pity that his contribution should have taken the form of debunking another's ideas rather than of a broader statement of his own: two of his three books were attacks on the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith.<br>
<br>McFadzean's internationalism was not an academic conversion but born of personal experience throughout the war years and his career with the Colonial Development Corporation and Shell. His respect for his associates in foreign countries was based on friendship and understanding, not on the anticipation of material gain for his company. The calculations may have been based on money, but the decisions were made on the importance of maintaining the relationship. This brought security and stability to difficult situations, and made solutions easier to find.<br>
<br>The origins of McFadzean's decisiveness are more elusive. His primary objective in Shell was to ensure that momentum was never stalled by indecision. He seemed to have a fear, perhaps emanating from his period of employment with the government, as a civil servant and then with a public sector corporation, that there were many ways in which a decision could be avoided and action frustrated. He contributed greatly to Shell's effectiveness in decision making, so important in the crisis years. The same was true of his time at British Airways, when he refused to be frustrated over Boeing, thus laying the proper foundation for a great airline. However, the same clarity fitted ill with the industrial relations of the 1970s. In this period agreements between employers and trade unions were labyrinthine, and there was little receptivity for broad-brush strategic moves. Agreements moved forward by inches. This fitted ill with McFadzean's background and humour, and it left a mark on his attitude and his health.<br>
<br>Throughout his working life McFadzean was a natural &#145;free trader&#146;, almost more at home in the dynamism and bustle of the Far East than in Britain itself. The excitement and the turbulence of the oil industry suited him well. Risk taking was second nature to him, and his fearlessness, born in the mountainous seas of the Atlantic Ocean, never left him. With no sense of hierarchy, he treated everyone as a colleague worth listening to and arguing with, although he knew where the buck stopped. For him a decision deferred was an opportunity lost. To those who knew him well he was straightforward and helpful. He held strong views but would welcome disagreement. His friendship was always worth having, not just for natural enjoyment but for the support it always conveyed. Nevertheless, for those who were more acquaintances than friends he could appear detached and reserved, and his gruff reactions could disturb rather than endear.<br>
<br>McFadzean was twice married: first in 1938 to Isabel McKenzie Beattie, who died in 1987, and second in 1988 to Sonja Lian Hoa Nio Khung. He died at his home, Woodside, Quarry Woods, Bisham, Berkshire, on 23 May 1992, of kidney and heart failure. He was survived by his second wife, and by the daughter of his first marriage, Felicity Carmen Francesca (<i>b</i>. 1946), who in 1979 married Sir Richard (later Baron) Marsh, the former Labour cabinet minister.<br>
