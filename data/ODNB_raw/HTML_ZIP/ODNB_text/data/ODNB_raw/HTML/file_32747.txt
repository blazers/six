</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davitt,  Michael</span>  (1846&#150;1906), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born in Straide, co. Mayo, on 25 March 1846, the second child of Martin Davitt and his wife, Catherine. Both parents were of peasant origins, but Davitt's father received a good early education and spoke English and Irish. The family survived the great famine of 1846&#150;9, but emerged impoverished and in arrears of rent. They were evicted in 1850, Michael Davitt always claiming a &#145;remembrance&#146; of the event. The family emigrated to Haslingden, east Lancashire, in November 1850, and Davitt was brought up in the closed world of the poor immigrant Irish community, with its strong nationalist values and, in his case, with a deep hatred of landlordism. After attending infant school Davitt began work in a mill at the age of nine, but lost his right arm in an accident on 8 May 1857, when he was ordered to tend a machine normally supervised by a seventeen-year-old boy. He then attended the local Wesleyan school, where he received a good education from a liberal-minded schoolmaster. In August 1861 he went to work again, this time as an errand boy with a local postmaster and printer, and later became a bookkeeper and typesetter. He attended evening classes at the mechanics' institute and came under the influence of Ernest Jones, the veteran Chartist leader, whose radical ideas included land nationalization, and the support of Irish independence.<h2>
<a name="WorkwiththeIRB"></a>Work with the IRB</h2>In 1865 Davitt joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), or &#145;Fenian&#146; movement, which enjoyed strong support among working-class Irish immigrants. Davitt soon became a &#145;centre&#146; of the Rossendale &#145;circle&#146; of the IRB (a group of some ten to a hundred men, under the command of their &#145;centre&#146;). He was involved in the abortive plot to seize Chester Castle to obtain weapons on 11 February 1867 as a prelude to a Fenian uprising in Ireland, but evaded the law. He helped organize a body of young men to defend Roman Catholic churches against protestant attacks in 1868 in the Haslingden area, and in the same year he became organizing secretary and arms agent for the IRB in England and Scotland, acting as a link between the &#145;centres&#146; and the supreme council of the IRB. He used his job as a &#145;hawker&#146; (travelling salesman) as a cover for his activities. He first came to the attention of the police in 1867, and was arrested at Paddington Station on 14 May 1870. At his trial for treason-felony a letter was cited to prove his complicity in planning murder, though in fact Davitt had written it to another member of the IRB to dissuade him from an assassination attempt on the life of a young member of the organization seen talking to a detective. Davitt was sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude, feeling that he had received neither a fair trial nor the best effort from his defence lawyer.<br>
<br>It was while in prison, in Millbank, Dartmoor, and Portsmouth, that Davitt revealed the tenacity of his character, and his ability to express his views even in the most trying circumstances. In August 1872 he managed to smuggle a letter out of prison criticizing the prison regime, which was published in several Irish and English newspapers, and which led to an inquiry by the home secretary into Davitt's allegations of harshness and cruelty. Upon his release in 1877 he prepared a pamphlet (published in 1878) which was the basis of his evidence before the royal commission on the working of penal servitude. Davitt always claimed that he had been victimized while serving his term, but he had frequently broken the rules, and was no worse treated than any other prisoner; as a self-recognized &#145;political&#146; prisoner, Davitt's real source of grievance was that he was treated like any ordinary convict. Davitt was released in December 1877 as a &#145;ticket-of-leave&#146; man, which authorized his freedom unless he should be convicted of some indictable offence in the United Kingdom, in which case the licence should be forfeited.<br>
<br>Davitt immediately renewed his connections with the IRB. He and other released prisoners were given a hero's welcome on landing in Ireland. His life from now on was one of constant movement, within Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain. His release was due to the efforts of the Home Rule Party in pressing for an amnesty for Irish nationalist prisoners, and Davitt made contact with the rising star of the home-rule movement, Charles Stewart Parnell. By this time the land question was assuming a new urgency, with Irish agriculture suffering a decline. It was a combination of the land question, Fenianism, and constitutionalism between 1878 and 1880 that created the politics of Parnellism, a unique blend of agrarian agitation and parliamentary leadership.<h2>
<a name="TheLandLeague"></a>The Land League</h2>In July 1878 Davitt went to the United States of America, where he met the leader of Irish American Fenianism, John Devoy. Here he called for an end to landlordism and for Irish independence, but his orthodox Fenianism was modified when he was attracted to the idea floated by Devoy of a compact with the home-rulers who supported Parnell against the more moderate leadership of Isaac Butt, since the &#145;end excused the means&#146;. In December 1878 Davitt returned to Ireland, where rural distress was now becoming more acute, and tenants were organizing to defend themselves against high rents and evictions. The first tenant right meeting to develop a strategy, held at Irishtown, co. Mayo, on 20 April 1879, was the result of local initiative; a second meeting at Westport on 8 June was larger, and again locally inspired, but Davitt attended this meeting and called for Irish freedom and an end to the evil of landlordism, ridding Ireland of &#145;the land robbers who seized it&#146;. Davitt's moment had come. He saw the need to channel the energies of the agitation into some more enduring organization, and in August 1879 he founded the Mayo Land League, with its slogan &#145;The land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland.&#146; Davitt and his colleagues succeeded in persuading Parnell to take the initiative in converting the Mayo league into a national land league. The second &#145;new departure&#146; combined constitutional and revolutionary agitation, but, unlike that of 1878, it was one that gathered widespread popular support. By now the government was seriously concerned about the revolutionary potential of the league, and Davitt was arrested in Sligo in November 1879. He had become convinced that Parnell must be supported; this cost Davitt his place on the supreme council of the IRB in May 1880, though he remained in its ranks for some years.<br>
<br>Davitt turned to Parnell as the only constitutional politician who could help achieve his aims; privately, he still spoke of the need to arm and prepare for violent conflict. But his breach with Fenianism widened as he committed himself ever more closely to the &#145;new departure&#146;. In May 1880 he went to America to organize the American Land League. Here he quarrelled with Fenians who declared that independence must come before land reform. In September 1880 Parnell called on tenants to &#145;shun&#146; those who broke the Land League's instructions, and on his return to Ireland in November 1880 Davitt embarked on a hectic phase of activity, including a visit to Ulster in January 1881 to address protestant and Presbyterian farmers, warning all tenants not to accept Gladstone's land reforms (including the so-called &#145;three Fs&#146;: fair rent, free sale, and fixity of tenure). But his appeal to the farmers of Ulster was undermined by his nationalist rhetoric, and his references to the &#145;Irish race&#146;. He was arrested in December 1880 but was released when the jury could not agree. Davitt described the jury as &#145;packed&#146;, even though the trial was manifestly fair and the judge showed him every consideration.<br>
<br>In February 1881 Davitt proposed a rent strike to the league executive in Dublin, arguing long after the event that such a move would have led to a &#145;kind of civil war&#146; but insisting that the end justified the means, since all &#145;modern Irish history&#146; showed that &#145;the only way to obtain reform for Ireland was by insurrection&#146;  (Moody, <span class="italic">Davitt</span>, 458). Whether or not this was the case, the league in October 1881 accepted the rent strike, but declared that it was the &#145;one constitutional weapon&#146; in its hands. Meanwhile Davitt on 3 February 1881 had his ticket-of-leave revoked, and he was sent to prison in Portland. While there, he was elected MP for County Meath, but disqualified. Davitt was by now developing his ideas on the land question. He had earlier taken an interest in the writings of Henry George, the American economic thinker, and while in prison in Portland he embraced the theory that land nationalization, not peasant proprietorship, was the key to Ireland's prosperity. By the time Davitt was released, in May 1882, Parnell was presiding over the demise of the Land League, and seeking to reach an accommodation with Gladstone. Davitt's supreme moment in Irish politics was now over. He went to America between June and July 1882, after which he produced a plan for a &#145;National Land and Industrial Union of Ireland&#146;, but Parnell opposed this. In September 1882 Davitt met Parnell at the latter's house, Avondale, where Davitt agreed to co-operate in Parnell's plan for a new national organization, and to set aside his plans for land nationalization. The Irish National League was under the official control of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and Davitt later described it as a &#145;parliamentary substitute&#146; for a &#145;semi-revolutionary organisation&#146;. When in 1890&#150;91 the Parnell divorce case split the party, Davitt first only asked Parnell to retire from the leadership of the party for six months, but later denounced Parnell on the grounds that he had deceived his colleagues and was morally disgraced. In so doing, he revealed a rather unpleasant talent for personal invective, though he was much provoked by what he now saw as Parnell's attempt to arouse young men to revolution, and by Parnell's taunts over Davitt's inconsistency.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifemarriagetravelsdeathandreputation"></a>Later life, marriage, travels, death, and reputation</h2>Davitt's support of the Irish National League earned him a further, and final, spell in prison in 1883. In 1885 his health broke down, and he toured the Middle East and Italy. He now became a kind of post-revolutionary figure even though he was only in his forties. He lectured on humanitarian issues in Britain, America, New Zealand, and Australia. In December 1886 he married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1861), daughter of John Yore of St Joseph, Michigan; they had two sons and three daughters. In 1887 he visited Wales to support land agitation. In January 1891 at Cork he founded the &#145;Irish Democratic and Trade and Labour Federation&#146;, urging a common interest between the British and Irish working man. He founded and edited a journal, <span class="italic">Labour World</span>, from September 1890 until May 1891. He visited South Africa in 1900 and denounced British imperialism. In 1903 he investigated Russian antisemitism, and went to Russia again in 1904, when he conversed with Tolstoy at Yasnia. He was returned to parliament for North Meath in 1892, North East Cork in 1893, and Mayo in 1895&#150;9, and welcomed Gladstone's second <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> as a &#145;pact of peace&#146; between England and Ireland. He supported Indian nationalism. He made a brief return to agrarian radicalism in 1898, when the United Irish League was active in the west of Ireland, but he denounced the 1903 Wyndham settlement for land purchase. He strongly supported the British Labour Party in the general election of 1906, mainly because he believed it would deliver Irish self-government. He died at 19 Lower Mount Street, Dublin, of blood poisoning on 31 May 1906, and was buried at Straide, co. Mayo. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Davitt was at the height of his political influence in the years 1879&#150;82. Thereafter his influence declined, but his version of the land war&#151;that it was a straight fight between landlord and peasant&#151;became the accepted account following the publication of his deeply influential <span class="italic">The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland</span> (1904). He had the strengths and weaknesses of the revolutionary: he exploited the agrarian crisis of 1879&#150;81, but expected too much from the farmers, whom he described in 1885 as responding to &#145;self-interest&#146;, not &#145;self-sacrifice&#146;. Davitt was an ascetic man, accepting no tribute for his work other than a house, known as Land League Cottage, at Ballybrack, co. Dublin. He was handsome, brave, and proud, but betrayed a lack of self-confidence and an impatience with those who disagreed with him. Like the old Fenian he was, he harboured suspicions of clerical influence, but, although for a time he ceased to be a communicant, he was an orthodox Roman Catholic, and was never a &#145;Godless revolutionary&#146; on the continental model.<br>
