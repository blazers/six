<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warner, Sir  Frank</span>  (1862&#150;1930), <span class="occ">silk manufacturer</span>, was born at 5 Punderson's Place, Bethnal Green, London, on 13 September 1862, the son of Benjamin Warner (1828&#150;1908), a silk designer, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Branscomb. When he left school in 1878, Frank and his elder brother Alfred went to Lyons to study silk manufacture and political economy. The family had been connected with the silk industry for several generations, and in 1870 his father had established the silk weaving firm of Warner, Sillett, and Ramm, which produced high quality fabrics. The firm was renamed Warner and Ramm in 1874. Frank joined the firm in 1881, serving his apprenticeship at its Hollybush Gardens factory; when in 1891 he and Alfred were made partners, the firm became known as Warner &amp; Sons. Under Benjamin Warner the business had developed through a series of take-overs of old-established weaving firms: Burnier in 1857, Norris &amp; Co. in 1885, and Daniel Walters of Braintree in 1894. Many of the Hollybush Gardens staff moved to Braintree, and eventually all the weaving took place at New Mills, where it was directed by Frank Warner. These take-overs led to the acquisition of a magnificent collection of silk designs which was one of the main strengths of the firm, which aimed to maintain the quality of the richly woven silk fabrics made in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Unfortunately the market for such goods was not large owing to their cost, but the firm was fortunate in receiving royal patronage and was commissioned to weave the coronation robes of both King Edward and Queen Alexandra and King George and Queen Mary. At the same time Warners also began to produce modern designs provided by freelance designers, who included Crane, Butterfield, and Silver.<br>
<br>Following the death of Benjamin Warner in 1908, Frank Warner and his brother Alfred continued in partnership, and in 1922 Frank's son, Cloudesley Warner, who had supervised the installation of power-looms in 1919, also became a partner. On Cloudesley Warner's advice a Paris showroom was opened in the rue Edward VII, but this had to close in 1926. Further expansion took place in 1926, when the firm acquired the silk printing works of Newman, Smith, and Newman, of Dartford, Kent. The original staff remained, and until 1932 all printing was carried out by hand using the traditional woodblocks. Three months after the early death of Cloudesley Warner in September 1928, Warner &amp; Sons became a private limited company, with the board consisting of Frank Warner, W. Bayford Stone, W. Vizard, and Warner's son-in-law Ernest Goodale.<br>
<br>Warner greatly contributed to the development of the English silk industry. In 1905, as a witness for the royal commission on tariff reform, he advocated a return to import duties on woven silks (which had been removed in 1860) in order to halt the decline of the industry. However, he realized that French designs were often superior and believed that designers should also receive a technical training in weaving. He gave lectures to the Society of Arts and numerous art and technical colleges, emphasizing the importance of the relationship between art and industry, and served as an examiner for the City and Guilds of London Institute from 1898 to 1905. He also played a part in organizing textile exhibitions both at home and abroad, notably those at Brussels in 1910, Turin in 1911, and Paris in 1925, when he served as chairman of the textile committee of the British section, for which he was made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. At home he organized the silk exhibition of 1912 and assisted with the Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924.<br>
<br>Warner served as president of the Silk Association of Great Britain and Ireland from 1910 to 1917 and of the Textile Institute from 1918 to 1920. He was chairman of the British Silk Research Association, the silk section of the London chamber of commerce, the silk advisory committee of the Imperial Institute (1917&#150;21), and the Board of Trade committee for the British Industries Fair (1920). In addition he had been adviser on textiles to the Board of Trade during the First World War. He became a member of the council of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1918 he was created KBE for services to the textile industry.<br>
<br>Warner's invention of a velvet fabric with three different heights of pile, which was patented in the UK in 1914, demonstrated his technical ability. His literary ability and very extensive knowledge of silk manufacturing is revealed in his book <span class="italic">The Silk Industry of the United Kingdom: its Origin and Development</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Warner married Kate Dennis, the daughter of Edmund Strange Parsons of Shernbourne Hall, near Kings Lynn, Norfolk, on 3 September 1890 at the parish church of Ingoldisthorpe. They had three children, Frank Cloudesley Folliott, who married Louise Gouet of Paris; Evelyn Sandford, who married Leonard Tibbitts; and Gwendolen Branscombe, who married Ernest Goodale, a solicitor. The death of his wife in March 1928, followed by that of Cloudesley in France the following September, was a severe blow to Warner. He retired in the summer of 1929, and died of pneumonia on 23 January 1930, aged sixty-seven, at his home, Woodcroft, Mottingham, Kent. He was buried on 27 January in Chislehurst cemetery, where his tombstone bears the inscription &#145;He wove truth with trust&#146;.<br>
