<span class="headword">Lehmann,  Hermann</span>  (1910&#150;1985), <span class="occ">biochemist and human geneticist</span>, was born on 8 July 1910 in Halle, Saxony, Germany, the youngest of the four children of Paul Lehmann (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1927), publisher, and his first wife, Bella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Apelt (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1913). His parents were both German. His eldest sister, Bertha, left Germany in the mid-1930s for New York, where she worked as a trained nurse. His second sister, Ruth, had left Germany earlier for Jerusalem as the wife of Ernst Wertheimer, a professor at Hadassah University. His third sister died aged eighteen. He also had a half-brother, from his father's second marriage, who settled in England and pursued a business career.<br>
<br>Lehmann received his early education at a state school in Halle. In 1923, following the collapse of his father's business, Lehmann's family moved to Dresden, and until 1928 he attended the Gymnasium zum Heiligen Kreuz. Wishing to pursue a career in medicine, in the summer of 1928 he enrolled on the medical course in the University of Freiburg im Breisgau. Later, he moved to the medical school at Frankfurt, where his family had settled after the death of his father, and passed the pre-clinical examination in July 1930. After a short spell of laboratory training in Berlin he went to Heidelberg to complete his clinical training. His work towards an MD degree was carried out in Heidelberg, but because of Nazi policies affecting Jews, it was presented in Basel in 1934. Lehmann subsequently returned to Heidelberg to work as an unpaid assistant in the laboratory of Otto Meyerhoff at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where he developed his love of biochemistry, carried out his early research, and published his first scientific papers.<br>
<br>In 1936 Lehmann moved to Cambridge (having already worked there briefly with Frederick Gowland Hopkins), where he obtained a PhD in 1938 with a thesis entitled &#145;Aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in the absence of molecular oxygen&#146;, which was awarded the Darwin prize at Christ's College. After a short period of internment as a &#145;friendly alien&#146; at the beginning of the Second World War, Lehmann married Benigna Norman-Butler, a music teacher and accompanist, in 1942. They had four children: Susanna, a musician and translator; Ruth, also a part-time musician; Paul, an associate professor of microbiology in the medical school at Toledo, Ohio; and David, who died aged eighteen as the result of an accident. In 1943 Lehmann became an officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps. It was during his service in India and, later, Uganda, as a colonial medical research fellow, that he developed his lifelong research interest in inherited blood diseases, particularly those of haemoglobin. After returning to England in 1949 he became consultant pathologist at Pembert Hospital, Kent, before being appointed to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, as senior lecturer in chemical pathology in 1951. In 1963 he moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and was appointed honorary director of the Medical Research Council's Abnormal Haemoglobin Research Unit, and in 1967 he became the first professor of clinical biochemistry at Cambridge University&#151;a position he held until 1977, when he became emeritus professor.<br>
<br>While in Uganda, Lehmann had become interested in sickle-cell anaemia. Stimulated by Linus Pauling's work in the USA showing that this disease was an inherited disorder of haemoglobin, he began a systematic search for abnormal human haemoglobins in many different populations throughout the world. As the techniques of protein chemistry became more sophisticated Lehmann was able to characterize many of these variants at the molecular level. This work provided important information about the origins of human races and how inherited abnormalities of a protein such as haemoglobin can give rise to a variety of different diseases. He also made early observations on the inheritance and causes of the thalassaemias, the commonest inherited disease of humans, also, like sickle-cell anaemia, caused by defective haemoglobin production. This work culminated in &#145;Molecular pathology of human haemoglobin&#146; (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 219, 1968, 402&#150;9), a brilliant paper written in collaboration with M. F. Perutz, in which the authors were able to relate the many different inherited abnormalities of human haemoglobin to its structure and function, both in health and disease.<br>
<br>Lehmann also made important contributions in other fields, including the study of myoglobin, the population genetics of blood groups, inherited disorders of human enzymes, and the characterization of the haemoglobin of many different species. But he was, more than anybody, responsible for cataloguing the enormous wealth of human genetic variation reflected in the human haemoglobin variants and hence for providing important insights into human population genetics, evolution, and the clinical diversity of disorders that result from inherited diseases.<br>
<br>Because of his international research interests Lehmann was well known in laboratories the world over, and he published widely with collaborators from many different countries. His laboratory in Cambridge was a training ground for young haematologists and human geneticists from many countries. He was extremely kind to young people and had broad cultural interests and an unquenchable curiosity and enthusiasm for his field. In 1977 he travelled together with D. J. Weatherall throughout China to search for haemoglobin diseases. During this trip he had a major confrontation with officials because he wished to enter Mongolia to obtain blood samples to search for a particular abnormal haemoglobin. Although almost seventy, in poor health, and with the full might of bureaucracy against him, he won the day and was able to find his beloved haemoglobin variant in the Mongolian races.<br>
<br>Lehmann was widely honoured for his work and was elected FRS, in 1972, and to many other fellowships and honorary degrees. He became CBE in 1980. He died in Cambridge after a short cardiac illness on 13 July 1985, and was buried there. He was survived by his wife.<br>
