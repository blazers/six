<span class="headword">Payne,  Antony <span class="st"> [Anthony; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>called </em>Cornish Giant]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691?), <span class="occ">giant</span>, was reputedly 7 feet 2 inches tall at the age of twenty-one. No authentic records of his parentage, birth date, baptism, or marriage survive, but there were certainly Paynes living during the seventeenth century in Stratton, Cornwall. Antony Payne evidently died and was buried there on 13 July 1691, according to later accounts aged about eighty. However, as the parish registers do not begin until 1687 it is possible that the record of Payne's burial has been lost and that the entry is of a kinsman of the same name. Sibilla Payne, buried at Stratton on 9 July 1691, may have been his wife. Payne was, it seems, throughout his life a devoted and valued retainer in peace and war of the Grenvilles of Stowe, notably of John Grenville, first earl of Bath. Again, documentation is lacking, but a clearly contemporary painting, confidently ascribed to Sir Godfrey Kneller and dated 1680, depicting a military Payne against a background of Plymouth citadel, where Bath was governor, gives credence to claims for Payne as a yeoman of the guard and halberdier there. After many vicissitudes of ownership and treatment, the portrait came late in the nineteenth century into the possession of the Royal Institution of Cornwall.<br>
<br>An engraving of the painting had accompanied a circumstantial account of Payne in C. S. Gilbert's <span class="italic">Historical Survey of Cornwall</span> (1817). From this point on the legend of a gentle giant&#151;the &#145;Falstaff of the West&#146;&#151;began to emerge, clinched by an article by R. S. Hawker, vicar of Morwenstow, Cornwall, in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> for 1866 (vol. 16), later incorporated into his <span class="italic">Footprints of Former Men in Far Cornwall</span> (1870). Inimical to the current processes of reform in church and state, and nostalgic for his own (but shared) brand of Stuart Anglican royalism, Hawker was more than a mere romancer. A purpose underlay all his writings in prose and verse. A slipshod researcher who &#145;never let facts, or the absence of them, stand in the way of his imagination&#146;  (Granville, vii) or his aspirations, Hawker presented Anthony (his spelling) as &#145;a true Stuart&#146;, &#145;a wonderful boy&#146;, plebeian but a leader, physically skilled, brave and bright, loyal to the end. No contemporary report puts Payne present at the battle of Lansdowne (5 July 1643), but Hawker prints a handsome consoling letter from him to Grace, widow of Sir Bevil Grenville, heroically killed in action there. Its style soon exposed it as a fabrication, but Hawker's vivid characterization, supported by dubious artefacts&#151;Payne's 6 quart flask&#151;and invented folk metaphors&#151;&#145;as long as Tony Payne's foot&#146;&#151;created an instant tradition which survived with advantages in Cornish popular history. Therein lies the true historical significance of Antony Payne: hardly in what he was or did in his own time, but for what was made of him from two centuries on, as a symbol of a continuing Cornish patriotism generally and for glimpses of the values of an arch-conservatism for which Hawker was in effect an enthusiastic literary agent.<br>
