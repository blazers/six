<span class="headword">Bobath <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Busse]</span>,  Berta Ottilie</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">physiotherapist</span>, was born in Berlin on 5 December 1907, the daughter of Hermann Busse, a Jewish manufacturer of dresses. She trained as a remedial gymnast in Germany, and married Kurt Roehl, from whom she later obtained a divorce; the couple had one son, Peter Lutz Roehl (1933&#150;1996). In 1938 she left Germany as a refugee and arrived in Britain, where she met another refugee, the psychiatrist Dr <a name="cosubject_49585"></a><span class="headword">Karel Bobath</span>  (1905&#150;1991)<span class="occ"></span>. Bobath was born in Berlin on 14 March 1905, the son of Hynak Bobath, a merchant from an Orthodox Jewish family in Prague. He was working in casualty at Willesden General Hospital when he married Berta on 23 April 1941 and became the adoptive father of her son, Peter.<br>
<br>Berta Bobath had worked in Germany with children suffering from cerebral palsy, and in 1944 she set up a unit for children affected by the condition at the Princess Louise Hospital, London. After the Second World War she was asked to treat the society portrait painter Simon Elwes, who had suffered a severe stroke, and with her help he learned to walk again and to paint with his left hand. This success led her to work on rehabilitating other stroke patients. She took the diploma of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy in 1950, and was awarded a fellowship of the society in 1954 for her thesis &#145;A study of abnormal postural reflex activity in patients with lesions of the central nervous system&#146;, which was published in 1975 as an illustrated monograph as <span class="italic">Motor Development in the Different Types of Cerebral Palsy</span>. In 1951 she started a private clinic, which became the Western Cerebral Palsy Centre, a registered charity, in 1957. Karel Bobath was honorary consultant physician of the charity. He had been an assistant psychiatrist at Brookwood Hospital, Woking, and went on to work with Dr Alex Shapiro at Harperbury Hospital in St Albans, where he set up the first unit for children with physical disabilities in a hospital for the mentally handicapped in England.<br>
<br>Berta Bobath did not believe that spasticity was untreatable, and at her clinic she was able to develop her neurological approach to treating children with cerebral palsy, based on the idea that such children were not born with abnormal patterns of posture and movement but developed them through their own activity, and that these could therefore be improved through correct positioning and handling. She believed in the importance of very early diagnosis and treatment, devising individual plans which included teaching parents how to handle their children at home. Her object was to counteract abnormal patterns of movement and avoid further deterioration, and thus help the child reach their full potential and to function as normally as possible. In treating adult stroke patients she concentrated on retraining the affected side through physiotherapy, rather than through allowing the patient to neglect the hemiplegic side and confine themselves to using the unaffected side. Her treatment was based on real-life situations, so that what the patient learned would be part of their daily routine, and not just a series of exercises divorced from daily life. She strongly believed that the more &#145;normal&#146; a patient could be, the easier it would be to readjust to family and social life. In all this she was greatly helped by her husband, from 1960 medical director of the cerebral palsy unit at Harperbury, who developed the theoretical basis to support her ideas.<br>
<br>The Bobaths developed postgraduate courses at the centre to train physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, and doctors in the Bobath approach to the treatment of neurological disorders. They went on lecture tours abroad, and addressed international conferences, developing a world-wide following. In 1975 the centre moved to larger premises in Hampstead, London, and was renamed the Bobath Centre. Berta Bobath was appointed MBE in 1978, and in 1981 she received an honorary doctorate from Boston University. She and her husband won the Harding award for &#145;outstanding work of benefit to the disabled&#146;. She published <span class="italic">Abnormal Postural Reflex Activity Caused by Brain Lesions</span> (1965; 3rd edn 1985) and <span class="italic">Adult Hemiplegia: Evaluation and Treatment</span> (1970; 3rd edn 1990).<br>
<br>Berta and Karel Bobath were both suffering from heart disease when they took drug overdoses and died together on 20 January 1991 at their home, 36C Arkwright Road, Camden. As a result of a memorial appeal, a new purpose-built Bobath Centre for Cerebral Palsy was opened in East Finchley in 1993.<br>
