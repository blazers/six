<span class="headword">Macdougall,  Allan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Ailean Dall]</span>  (1750?&#150;1829), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Glencoe, Argyll. As a boy he was apprenticed to a tailor, who, according to the local custom, travelled between farms wherever his services were called for, and on his working peregrinations Macdougall was able to acquire a deep knowledge of Gaelic song and story. His blindness, according to tradition, was the result of an attack upon him by a fellow apprentice who took umbrage at Macdougall's habitually sarcastic tongue; he was thereafter known as Ailean Dall (&#145;Blind Allan&#146;). Following his incapacitation, Macdougall turned particularly to music and became a competent fiddle player, earning a scanty living entertaining at country celebrations. About 1790 Macdougall moved with his family to Inverlochy, near Fort William, where a man named Stewart who owned a large farm granted him the use of a small property on his land. In this neighbourhood Macdougall's reputation as a poet and entertainer grew and, with the assistance of Ewan Maclachlan, a fellow poet and tradition-bearer, he collected together poems and poem versions of his own (along with some work of Maclachlan's), material which was published in Edinburgh as <span class="italic">Orain Ghaidhealacha</span> (1798). After the good reception of this volume, Colonel Alasdair Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry employed Macdougall as his family bard. In 1828 Macdougall travelled the counties of Argyll, Ross-shire, and Inverness-shire seeking (and obtaining 1000) subscriptions for a new, enlarged edition of <span class="italic">Orain Ghaidhealacha</span>, but he died the following year while his project was in press. He was buried at Kilfinan, Argyll.<br>
<br>Macdougall specialized in poetic pieces of a panegyric and ribald nature, as well as in song. One of his most notorious and resonant poetic gambits was his attack on lowland shepherds whose brand of farming signalled, for Macdougall, the depopulation of the highlands.<br>
