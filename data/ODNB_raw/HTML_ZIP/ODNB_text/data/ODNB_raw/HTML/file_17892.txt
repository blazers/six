<span class="headword">Mallory,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was a native of Northamptonshire, although his date of birth and parents are unknown; he is not to be confused with the royalist Cheshire clergyman of the same name. Having matriculated as a sizar from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, at Lent 1630, he graduated BA in 1634 and proceeded MA in 1637. He was ordained priest in the diocese of Peterborough on 9 June 1639.<br>
<br>Little is known of Mallory's wife, other than her likely name, Frances, and the fact that she predeceased her husband, dying in or before January 1669. The couple had, at the least, a son and six daughters, of whom the eldest, Frances, was baptized at St Nicholas, Deptford, on 19 July 1644, not long after her father's nomination on 1 February as vicar of that parish. On 3 August 1645 Bulstrode Whitelocke &#145;tooke in short hand a Sermon of Mr Mallery att Deptford &amp; repeated it to his family this Sabbath day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 177). Mallory's church politics were not to the taste of John Evelyn, but the diarist recorded in 1653 that though the present incumbent was &#145;somewhat of the Independent, yet he ordinarily preached sound doctrine, and was a peacable man; which was an extraordinary felicity in this age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 2.65). On 6 August 1657, he noted, Mallory &#145;declaimed against the folly of a sort of enthusiasts and desperate zealots, called the Fifth Monarchy Men, pretending to set up the kingdom of Christ with the sword&#146;  (ibid., 2.122). On 29 September 1657 Mallory was named an assistant to the Kent commission into the ministry. Evelyn attended his farewell sermon at Deptford on 17 January 1659. Soon afterwards, Mallory took up a lectureship at St Michael, Crooked Lane, London, where he preached, probably on Sunday afternoons, for a period of two years from 25 March 1659.<br>
<br>In a 1660 list of London congregational ministers Mallory is given as also preaching at St James's, Duke's Place. His sermon, &#145;How may we have suitable conceptions of God in duty?&#146;, was published by Samuel Annesley in <span class="italic">The Morning-Exercise at Cripple-Gate</span>. Mallory was one of twenty-five signatories of <span class="italic">The renuntiation and declaration of the ministers of congregational churches and public preachers of the same judgment</span>, a document issued in order to dissociate those churches from the Venner rising in January 1661. Ejected from his lectureship some time later, on 24 March 1662, Mallory accompanied Bulstrode Whitelocke and Dr John Goodwin to the house of the lord chancellor, where it was reported that Clarendon:<blockquote>discoursed very freely about liberty of Conscience &amp; professed himselfe a great friend to it, &amp; that he would bring the K[ing] to assure it to them &hellip; they thought their desires in this point to be accomplished &hellip; [but] after an hours discourse &hellip; he dismissed them, &amp; proved afterwards the greatest ennemy that could be to them &amp; their desires. (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 645)</blockquote>In 1669 Mallory was a signatory of a preface to <span class="italic">Death and Life</span> by the Amsterdam preacher Samuel Malbon, whose &#145;name is sweet and precious amongst those saints and people to whom he preaches&#146;, together with William Greenhill, Joseph Caryl, and Richard Lawrence, a grouping which testifies to his continuing congregational outlook. He died, probably in London, in January 1689.<br>
