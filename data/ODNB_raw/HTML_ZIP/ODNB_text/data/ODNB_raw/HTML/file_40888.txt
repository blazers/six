<span class="headword">Bullett,  Gerald William</span>  (1893&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer and broadcaster</span>, was born on 30 December 1893 at 107 Brockley Rise, Forest Hill, London, the third of the three sons of Robert Bullett (1851&#150;1914), a schoolmaster, later a coal agent, and Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pegg (1848&#150;1904), a farmer's daughter from Ullesthorpe, Leicestershire. In 1895 the family moved to Muswell Hill in north London, where Gerald was educated at a small private day school. His mother died when he was ten, and at sixteen he became a bank clerk. He wrote his first novel (unpublished and later destroyed) at eighteen. His second, <span class="italic">The Progress of Kay</span>, a study of suburban adolescence, was immediately accepted by Constable, and published in 1916, when he was serving with the Royal Flying Corps in France.<br>
<br>On demobilization Bullett applied for entry to Cambridge as an ex-serviceman, and sent some poems and a copy of <span class="italic">The Progress of Kay</span> to Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, who persuaded Jesus College to accept him. He read English, graduated with first-class honours in 1921, and married Edith Marion (Rosalind) Barker, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gould (1887&#150;1982) on 5 December the same year. Their marriage proved fulfilling and purposeful, Rosalind acting as housekeeper, hostess, and secretary. Since both preferred country life, they lived frugally in a succession of rented houses in the home counties, finally settling in an Elizabethan farmhouse at East Harting in Sussex. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>After Cambridge Bullett began reviewing for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and other journals, and then embarked on a career as an assiduous short-story writer and poet, small-time publisher, and editor and author of some forty published books.<br>
<br>In 1923 Bullett published a critical study of G. K. Chesterton. In April 1926 he was the first author to broadcast his own short story, &#145;The Baker's Cart&#146;, from the BBC's 2LO station, and thereafter he frequently adapted and performed his own work for radio. From 1926 to 1934 he acted as reader for the publishing firm of Gerald Howe, and served on the selection committee of the Book Society. He published a number of novels during this period including <span class="italic">The History of Egg Pandervil</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Nicky, Son of Egg</span> (1929), which chronicle the impact of the First World War on a rural family. In the 1930s he brought out <span class="italic">Helen's Lovers</span> (1932), a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">I'll Tell you Everything</span> (1932), a detective novel written jointly with J. B. Priestley, <span class="italic">The English Galaxy</span> (1933), an anthology of short poems, <span class="italic">The Bubble</span> (1934), one of a few selections of his own poetry, <span class="italic">The Happy Mariners</span> (1935), a story for children, and <span class="italic">The Jury</span> (1935), which has a neat plot, delicate character drawing, and an engaging style. <span class="italic">The Snare of the Fowler</span> (1936), a retelling of the Oedipus legend in a contemporary setting, created a stir among his regular readers and prompted some reviews which made him apprehensive for his future as a writer. Although Alfred Knopf enthused over its fine qualities, publishing it in the USA in the same year, and Quiller-Couch and E. M. W. Tillyard, to whom Bullett turned for reassurance, did their best to rebuild his confidence by pointing out the book's many merits, he never again attempted such a problematic or ambitious theme. The regular annual appearance of Bullett's novels was interrupted only by the Second World War. From 1940 to 1943 he was employed by the BBC Overseas Service as a talks producer. He broadcast a series of talks entitled <span class="italic">Life at Home</span>, describing everyday activities, and the unassuming heroism of the civilian population. After 1945 he chaired literary discussions and reviewed novels and poetry, giving succinct assessments of Elizabeth Gaskell and George Eliot (he published a biography of her in 1947). In 1946, in collaboration with Tsui Chi Lai, he made a &#145;rendering&#146; of a sequence of poems by Fan Cheng-ta written in 1186. Although attacked by serious English scholars of Chinese poetry, it reads well (it was reprinted in Hong Kong, with the original Chinese text interleaved, in 1980). Of his post-war novels <span class="italic">The Elderbrook Brothers</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Alderman's Son</span> (1954), <span class="italic">The Daughters of Mrs Peacock</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">The Peacock Brides</span> (1958) are among the most interesting. He also wrote two detective novels, <span class="italic">One Man's Poison</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Odd Woman Out</span> (1958) under the pen name Sebastian Fox.<br>
<br>Bullett's fiction is pervaded by feeling for his maternal midland roots, and memories of his Edwardian childhood in Muswell Hill among the &#145;middle middle-class&#146;  (Kunitz and Colby). The contentment of his thirty productive years in Sussex, from where he was lured to London only by agents or publishers, never quite obliterated his &#145;terror of being at the world's mercy&#146;. He disliked intrusions into his private life from any quarter, saying:<blockquote>On the rare occasions when I pick up a book of my own and glance through it, the intimacy of the revelation almost makes me blush. There I am, written down. What more can the most inquisitive reader demand?</blockquote>He remained, in Storm Jameson's words, &#145;one of God's honest stubborn &hellip; eternally youthful English&#146;.<br>
<br>Storm Jameson, who knew Bullett as a young man, said that his &#145;clumsy head and body housed a poet of extreme elegance&#146;. His novels pay a measured tribute to the decency, obstinacy, and compassion with which ordinary English men and women attempted to order their lives during the first troubled decades of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Bullett died on 3 January 1958 in the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester, and was cremated on 8 January in Brighton. His posthumous <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was published in 1959, and contains many attractive lyrics.<br>
