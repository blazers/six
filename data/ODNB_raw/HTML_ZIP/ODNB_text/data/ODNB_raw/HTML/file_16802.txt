<span class="headword">Livingstone,  Charles</span>  (1821&#150;1873), <span class="occ">missionary and traveller in Africa</span>, younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16803/', "David Livingstone")</script>, was born at Blantyre in Lanarkshire on 28 February 1821, the son of Neil Livingstone and his wife, Agnes Hunter. He attended the local school and worked with his brother in the cotton factory of H. Monteith &amp; Co., from which he moved to a lace factory at Hamilton, near Glasgow. He devoted his leisure time to study, and became a Sunday school teacher. In 1840 he emigrated to the United States of America, where he became a student at Oberlin College, Ohio, a training college for missionaries. In 1847 he entered the Union Theological College in New York city, from which he took his degree in 1850. He then held ministerial posts in New York state, Vermont, and Massachusetts. On 29 January 1852 he married Harriette Cemanthia Ingram (<i>d</i>. 1900) in Plympton, Massachusetts; they had three children.<br>
<br>In April 1857 Livingstone went to Britain on leave of absence, and met his brother David, fresh from his discoveries in central Africa, who induced him to leave his family and his post in America, and to join the Zambezi expedition (1858&#150;64), as &#145;moral agent&#146;. Through many privations and difficulties he remained with the expedition until 1863, when he was invalided home and went to join his family in America. His health did not, however, allow him to resume his ministerial duties, and after writing out his journal he again went to meet his brother in England, to assist him in preparing a joint journal, <span class="italic">Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi</span> (1865). In October 1864 he accepted an appointment as her majesty's consul for the Bight of Biafra, west Africa, which was extended in 1867 to include the Bight of Benin. His time as consul was taken up largely in dealing with the ramifications for British trading interests of the crisis within the state of Bonny, which culminated in the secession of Opobo in 1869, and of the accompanying wars across the Niger delta. His actions, particularly in demanding a trade blockade, made him unpopular with British traders and he was recalled by the Foreign Office in 1873. His career as consul was dogged by ill health and he died at sea near Lagos on 28 October 1873, during his return to Britain.<br>
