<span class="headword">Knox,  Robert</span>  (1641&#150;1720), <span class="occ">merchant and writer on Ceylon</span>, was born on 8 February 1641 on Tower Hill, London, the second child of Robert Knox (<i>bap</i>. 1606, <i>d</i>. 1661) and Abigail, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bonnell (<i>d</i>. 1655/6). The Knox family came from Nacton, Suffolk, and later moved to Wimbledon, Surrey, where Robert suffered &#145;no affliction and lived without want&#146;. His father was a ship's captain operating profitably between England and the Levant. Robert's early education was under the deeply religious direction of his mother. He was then sent to the boarding-school at Barnes, Surrey, where he was taught by James Fleetwood, later bishop of Worcester.<br>
<br>In 1655 Knox's father took delivery of a new ship, the <i>Anne</i>, and on 7 December 1655 sailed with his son for India: first to Fort St George, Madras, then to Bengal, before returning to London in July 1657. The voyage was successful and the elder Knox promptly began preparations for a second passage. In the meantime Oliver Cromwell had issued a charter granting the East India Company a new monopoly of trade to the East, which required Knox to put his vessel and crew in the company's service (13 November 1657). The <i>Anne</i> sailed from England on 21 January 1658 to the Coromandel coast and Persia. During a voyage of limited commercial success she was dismasted in a storm at Masulipatam (19 November 1659). Captain Knox was instructed to take her to Kottiar Bay, Ceylon, to step a new mainmast and to engage in whatever trade was possible.<br>
<br>At this time Ceylon was ruled by the king of Kandy, Rajasinha II, with whom the Dutch had a long-standing but increasingly tense alliance. The Dutch helped to rid Ceylon of the Portuguese in return for total control over the cinnamon trade. Under Rijklof van Goens the Dutch policy was to keep Rajasinha in debt, to promise food and housing to all inhabitants who would settle in areas under Dutch control, and to expand the Dutch frontiers inland at every opportunity. They had expelled the Portuguese from Colombo (1656), but had not honoured their promise to return the town to the king. Rajasinha was justifiably disenchanted with the activities of Europeans in his country. On his arrival Knox's father made the grave mistake of not sending a letter explaining his presence along with the customary present to the king to ensure his protection. Robert Knox states that this lapse in courtesy was the &#145;main reason of our Suprize&#146;, because Rajasinha, &#145;Who looking upon himself as a great Monarch, as he is indeed, requires to be treated with sutable State&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Historical Relation</span>, pt 4, chap. 1).<br>
<br>Between 4 and 10 April 1660 sixteen members of the <i>Anne</i>'s crew were taken captive by Rajasinha's troops. The Knoxes were separated from the other captives (16 September 1660) and put together in open detention in a village about 30 miles from Kandy. Both men suffered from malaria, and after a long illness the elder Knox died (9 February 1661). Robert Knox was moved around Ceylon, managing to establish himself as a farmer, moneylender, and pedlar. Eventually he and his close associate Stephen Rutland escaped to the safety of the Dutch fort at Aripu (18 October 1679), bringing to an end a captivity of over nineteen years. After generous treatment by the Dutch on Ceylon and at Batavia, Knox arrived at the English settlement at Bantam in Java (4 February 1680), from where he travelled to London (24 February 1680), arriving in September 1680.<br>
<br>During the voyage to England, Knox wrote the manuscript of what became <span class="italic">An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, in the East Indies</span>. His manuscript came to the attention of the directors of the East India Company, who recommended its publication. It was rearranged with the help of his cousin the ecclesiastical historian and biographer Revd John Strype and encouragement from Robert Hooke of the Royal Society. The book, published in 1681, was widely read, and translated into German, Dutch, and French during Knox's lifetime, and made him famous. The book influenced the work of contemporaries such as Daniel Defoe, who drew from Knox's experiences much of the context for, and the aspirations of, his hero in <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1719). He also carefully summarized Knox's experiences in the novel <span class="italic">Captain Singleton</span> (1720). The direct and idiomatic language used by Knox, his acute observation of details, the importance of practical self-sufficiency and strength of character, and his use of factual reality as the basis for fiction were influential in shaping the evolution of the &#145;English novel&#146;. Likewise his close focus offered a detailed and objective study of Sinhalese topography, economic and social life (especially of the ordinary people), cultural characteristics, and conditions in the interior of the country, which has ensured that his book remains a fundamental source for the economic history and anthropology of mid-seventeenth-century Ceylon.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1680 Knox gained the patronage of Sir Josiah Child, chairman of the East India Company, and after he had successfully studied navigation he was employed as captain of the <i>Tonqueen Merchant</i>, for four voyages to the East over the next thirteen years. He experienced mixed fortunes and an increasing disillusionment with the East India Company's regulations covering the private trade of ships' officers. By 1694 he could no longer tolerate the company's removal of &#145;the Indulgence, as they call it, which is leave to bringe whome toyes and small things of little value free of mults&#146;  (Knox, &#145;Autobiography&#146;, fols. 46 and 62). He quarrelled with Child and the company, which dispensed with his services.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1698, after four years during which he &#145;grew wary of a Idle and droneish life&#146;  (Knox, &#145;Autobiography&#146;, fol. 59), Knox took advantage of the ending of the East India Company's monopoly (1694) and invested in a private venture in the <i>Mary</i>, via Cadiz, bound for Surat, where he arrived on 1 February 1699. There was much dissension on board, and the voyage, under the direction of Thomas Lucas, was not a success. Knox returned to England in 1701, completing his seventh and final voyage to the East. Now, aged sixty, he decided he had enough of a competency to retire. He settled in London, where he spent most of his time writing further observations about Ceylon, accounts of his life, and letters to various people. On 12 April 1703 he engaged in a successful lawsuit to recover a small portion of land (in Biggery Meede, manor of Wimbledon) bought by his father on 24 April 1654, and resumed by the current lord of the manor on the grounds that the Knox family was extinct  (ibid., fols. 71&#150;5).<br>
<br>Robert Knox died at St Peter-le-Poer, London, on 19 June 1720 and was buried in Wimbledon church, possibly beside his mother. In his will he left numerous personal belongings of value: books, manuscripts, silverware. As well there were specific bequests of money amounting to at least &pound;1370. The remainder of the estate and the quarter-acre block in Wimbledon went to his executor, Edward Lascelles, son of Knox's sister Abigail.<br>
