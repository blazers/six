<span class="headword">Maitland,  James</span>, eighth earl of Lauderdale  (1759&#150;1839), <span class="occ">politician and political economist</span>, was born on 26 January 1759 at Hatton House, Ratho, Edinburghshire. He was the eldest surviving son of the six sons and six daughters of James Maitland, seventh earl of Lauderdale (1718&#150;1789), landowner and army officer, and his wife, Mary Turner (1733/4&#150;1789), only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16956/', "Sir Thomas Lombe (1685&#150;1739)")</script>, a silk manufacturer and London alderman.<h2>
<a name="Educationandentryintopolitics"></a>Education and entry into politics</h2>Styled Viscount Maitland from birth, he was educated at Edinburgh high school and at Edinburgh University. His tutor Andrew Dalzel took him to Paris in 1774, and in 1775 he spent a term at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1777 he proceeded to Glasgow University, where he studied under John Millar, and entered Lincoln's Inn. He became an advocate in Edinburgh in July 1780 and had scarcely practised when in September 1780 he was returned to parliament for Newport, Cornwall, on the duke of Northumberland's interest. On 15 August 1782 he married an heiress, Eleanor (1761/2&#150;1856), only surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58418/', "Anthony Todd")</script>, secretary to the Post Office, and Ann Robinson. Described by the writer Elizabeth Grant as &#145;a nice little painted doll, a cipher as to intellect&#146;  (E. Grant, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Highland Lady</span>, ed. J. M. Strachey, 1898, 293), Eleanor brought Maitland a dowry of &pound;50,000 and her father's pledge of &pound;10,000 on the birth of each of their children, of which they had four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>On entering the Commons, Maitland attached himself to Charles James Fox, then in opposition, who valued him. He gave his maiden speech, on 26 February 1781, in favour of Edmund Burke's reforms to the civil list and deplored the extravagance of the war with the American colonies. He praised Fox's East India bill and defended the outgoing coalition ministry in December 1783 against the royal preference for William Pitt. From 1784 he sat for Marlborough on the Wilkins interest and supported the opposition, except when in May 1787 it accused his father-in-law of abuses in administering the Post Office. In the same month he mooted a bill enabling the eldest sons of Scottish peers to sit for Scottish burghs. He was one of the managers of Warren Hastings's impeachment and opposed the exclusion of the prince of Wales from the regency council. He upheld the rights of slave owners in opposing abolition of slavery on 21 May 1789; he reiterated these views in the Lords in 1794 and changed over to the abolitionists only in 1806. His succession to the earldom in August 1789 terminated his Commons career.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionpeer"></a>Opposition peer</h2>In 1790 Lauderdale was elected a Scottish representative peer, and he first spoke in the Lords on 11 April 1791 against the war in India. In the debate on the proclamation against seditious writings on 31 May 1791 he mocked Pitt, the duke of Richmond, and Benedict Arnold for their desertion of parliamentary reform. Richmond replied heatedly and Lauderdale challenged him to a duel, which was averted. A duel did take place between Lauderdale and Arnold on 1 July, in which neither was injured. In August 1792 he travelled to Paris with Dr John Moore, leaving for Calais during the September massacres and returning in December. A founder member of the Society of the Friends of the People at home, he styled himself Citizen, affected Jacobin costume, and befriended the revolutionary Brissot. Back in the Lords, he twice intemperately attacked the <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span> and on 1 February 1793 attributed French hostilities and atrocities to counter-revolutionary pressure. He subsequently opposed the war with France and the British government's repression of civil liberties. He championed the Scottish reformers Thomas Muir and Thomas Palmer, imprisoned for seditious libel, and visited them aboard the hulks, but was undermined in debate by Lord Mansfield on 15 April 1794.<br>
<br>Having opposed voluntary subscriptions to the war effort, Lauderdale was alleged by government sources to be handling French propaganda funds; he was examined at the Home Office about dealings with William Stone, a supposed French agent. On 30 April he condemned allied endeavours to overthrow the French regime and subsequently supported the duke of Bedford's motions for peace. He led opposition to the suspension of habeas corpus by the British government and in November opposed the bills against treasonable practices and seditious meetings, accompanying Fox to a protest meeting in Westminster. He claimed credit for thwarting government plans to apply the law of treason to utterances and for mitigating the penalties for second offences. In March 1796 he joined Bedford in attacking Edmund Burke's pension, suggesting that the pension fund should be diverted to public works. Burke responded with <span class="italic">A Letter to a Noble Lord</span>, which targeted Bedford and virtually ignored Lauderdale. On 13 May he and Lord Lansdowne produced fifteen resolutions subverting government versions of public accounts. These, like most of his motions, failed without a division.<h2>
<a name="Politicaleconomist"></a>Political economist</h2>Lauderdale's politics, illustrated in his <span class="italic">Letters to the Peers of Scotland</span> (1794), written when he was the only Scottish peer left in opposition, prevented his re-election to the Lords from 1796 onwards. Frustrated, he encouraged Fox's secession from the Commons and considered abdicating his peerage. Out of parliament he became a freeman of London and concentrated on writing on finance and the economy. His anonymously published pamphlet <span class="italic">Thoughts on Finance</span> was followed in 1798 by <span class="italic">A Letter on the Present Measures of Finance</span>, which was critical of Pitt's budgetary expedients. His <span class="italic">Plan for Altering the Manner of Collecting a Large Part of the Public Revenue</span> (1799) proposed substituting inheritance tax for income tax and reducing indirect duties. In 1804, the year when Glasgow University made him an LLD, he published <span class="italic">An inquiry into the nature and origin of public wealth, and into the means and causes of its increase</span>, a thesis which was enlarged in 1819. He questioned Adam Smith's theory of the relationship between labour and value, maintaining that wealth was a compound of labour, land, and capital, and value was a compound of utility and scarcity. He argued that capital was capable of harnessing productive labour to make profits by meeting market demand, and that such profits resulted only when there were no legislative restraints on commerce and no burdens, such as Pitt's sinking fund to redeem the national debt. His thesis was critically reviewed by Henry Brougham in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (July 1804). His retaliatory <span class="italic">Observations</span> provoked further <span class="italic">Thoughts</span> from Brougham in 1805. Lauderdale published two more pamphlets that addressed problems of the Irish currency and the effects of absentee Irish landlords' remission of income.<h2>
<a name="ReturntotheLords"></a>Return to the Lords</h2>The duke of Bedford's death in 1802 raised the possibility of Lauderdale succeeding as opposition leader in the Lords if he obtained a British peerage, but Lauderdale only returned to Westminster four years later when Fox and Lord Grenville formed a coalition ministry. He was created first Baron Lauderdale of Thirlestane in the British peerage on 22 February 1806 but was denied a cabinet seat by Grenville. Fox encouraged his ambition to govern India but Lauderdale was deterred by the hostility of the court of directors and instead became lord keeper of the great seal of Scotland, with an income of &pound;4000 a year. He wished to purge Scotland of Lord Melville's influence but his tenure of the post was short-lived. On 2 August he was sent to Paris to join Lord Yarmouth in peace negotiations with Napoleon Bonaparte; he had been sworn of the privy council on 21 July. After reporting Yarmouth's improper speculations Lauderdale replaced him as chief negotiator, though his mission proved impossible. He left France on 8 October and justified his conduct in the Lords on 2 January 1807. In March he defended the <span class="roman">Scottish Judicature Bill</span> and continued to do so from the opposition benches after the change of ministry in April, which deprived him of office. In opposition he joined with Grey, Grenville, and Holland in defending other uncompleted measures of their ministry. He moved resolutions against orders in council regulating licensed trade on 22 March 1808 and remained critical of the conduct of the war.<br>
<br>A deist in religion, Lauderdale questioned the validity of increasing stipends of Scottish clergy, in a speech, later published, of 20 May 1808, and in June opposed the curates' residence bill. Among his other regular targets in debate were the East India Company, which he criticized in print in 1809, and the judicial system. He gave warm support to the reduction of criminal penalties championed by Sir Samuel Romilly and later welcomed the introduction of trial by jury in Scotland in February 1815. Ambitious to return to ministerial office, Lauderdale had long cultivated the prince of Wales and his brother, the duke of York, and wished for the abdication of the incapacitated George III. He sought to reverse the duke's public disgrace over the army contracts affair and in December 1810 took the prince's part in opposing restrictions on his regency. When the prince objected to Grenville's and Grey's principled refusal to take office in his first regency ministry, Lauderdale rebuked him at Carlton House on 22 February 1812 but he failed to overcome the regent's dislike of Grey.<br>
<br>Lauderdale thus remained in opposition and continued to voice his opinions on financial and economic issues. In March 1811 he had deplored excessive issue of paper currency, which had caused coin to disappear and paper money to depreciate. He opposed the gold coin and bank note bill introduced in July by Lord Stanhope in an attempt to stabilize paper currency, arguing that only a resumption of cash payments by the Bank of England could reverse the trend. In February 1812 he spoke out against the <span class="roman">Framework Bill</span>, provoked by the actions of distressed Luddites, and advocated retrenchment of public finances. However, his attempt to probe East India Company assets and Bank of England profits failed, as did his motion of 1 May for a committee on the circulating currency; he countered by opposing the <span class="roman">Local Tokens Bill</span>. His pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Depreciation of the Paper-Currency of Great Britain Proved</span> (1812) and <span class="italic">Further Considerations</span> (1813) provided the basis of his speeches in the 1812 parliament. On 18 May 1813 he again deplored the sinking fund scheme and on 21 June he opposed renewal of the East India Company charter. His motion against over-issue of paper currency failed on 9 July but he persisted by objecting to the renewed restriction of cash repayments on 26 April 1814. He took a protectionist line in his <span class="italic">Letter on the Corn Laws</span> (1814) which he reiterated in his protests against repeal of corn export bounties and against massive imports of foreign corn. Retrenchment was his main theme in March 1816 and he tried to hasten the resumption of cash payments by the bank in May. His own preference for a silver standard was overruled by Lord Liverpool in June in favour of the gold standard.<br>
<br>The social policies of Liverpool's administration also kept Lauderdale in active opposition. He opposed the suspension of habeas corpus in March 1817 and appealed for universities to be excluded from the penalties under the <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Bill</span>. In debates in June he characterized a bill to combat unemployment as a chimerical attempt to provide general parochial relief, and attacked the game laws. Soon afterwards, in opposing the <span class="roman">Aliens Bill</span>, he attempted to preserve the non-alien status of the Bank of Scotland foreign shareholders. He was critical of the cotton factory regulation bill, particularly its measures regarding child labour, and advocated its extension to factories in other industries, yet he ridiculed a bid to ban boy chimney sweeps. Royal affairs continued to attract his interest and he objected to the duke of Cumberland's exclusion from the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Bill</span> in May 1818, having mediated in Cumberland's quarrel with his mother the queen over his marriage. He also questioned the queen's control over the Windsor establishment.<br>
<br>Throughout Lauderdale kept up pressure for a resumption of cash payments. When the parliamentary committee examining the issue, chaired by Robert Peel, published its report in favour of resumption, he agreed with it that an abrupt recourse to a depreciated metallic currency would cripple commerce. On 15 June 1819 he sought judicial views on the legality of the flawed coinage. He believed that lower taxation would best relieve economic problems, as stated in debates on 21 June, and on 17 December he blamed economic distress on excessive public expenditure. In May 1820 he insisted that the peacetime depression had hit agriculture as well as commerce and manufacture.<h2>
<a name="Courtier"></a>Courtier</h2>On 19 July 1820 Lauderdale defended the conduct of his brother Thomas as a colonial governor, but his exertions were far greater on behalf of George IV, whose queen faced a trial for adultery. A member of the Lords' secret committee investigating the charges, he delivered a keynote speech on 2 November stating the case against Caroline, which, when it was published, became the talk of the town. The king rewarded him by appointing him a knight of the Thistle, on 17 July 1821. By now a courtier, he had abandoned most of his whig credentials and objected to the disfranchisement of rotten boroughs unless all voters were corrupt. In 1824 and 1825 he attempted to restrain the proliferation of joint-stock companies that lacked sound finances. In 1826 he clashed with Liverpool over the bank charter agreement, contrasting the confidence placed by the Scottish public in their banks with English distrust of theirs. That year, as in 1822, he advocated protection against imports of foreign grain, and on 8 March 1827 he secured a select committee on the sliding scale of duties on imported grain. This remained his favourite subject until 1828 when he supported Wellington's ministry and was reported to have influence over its counsels. On 17 June 1828 he approved a bill enabling Scottish peers to sit in the Commons. He remained critical of parliamentary reform and in 1829 published <span class="italic">Three Letters to the Duke of Wellington</span>, which set out the false economies of adopting a sinking fund.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's final speech was made against the <span class="roman">Scottish Court of Session Bill</span> on 12 July 1830. He took his seat in the Lords the following year but absented himself for health reasons, though a suspected underlying reason was his embarrassment at opposing Lord Grey's administration. The passage of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, which he opposed by proxy while engineering the election of twelve anti-reformers as representative peers, induced him to retire to his Scottish estate. He died at Thirlestane Castle, near Lauder, Berwickshire, on 15 September 1839 and was buried in the family vault at Haddington Abbey on 20 September. Long dismissed as eccentric, his contribution to economic theory has more recently been acknowledged.<br>
<br>Lauderdale's second son, <a name="cosubject_17817"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Maitland</span>, tenth earl of Lauderdale  (1785&#150;1863), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 10 June 1785 at Walthamstow, Essex, and entered the navy, aged ten, as admiral's servant on the <i>Victory</i>. A midshipman under Admiral St Vincent in 1798, he was wounded in Nelson's attack on the Boulogne flotilla in 1801. He next served in the Mediterranean and East Indies and from 1811 captained the <i>Pique</i> in other stations, seizing an American privateer. As captain of the <i>Glasgow</i> he took part in the bombardment of Algiers in 1816, for which he was made CB. He had been elected to parliament on the family interest for Haddington burghs on 16 July 1813 and in the intervals of service voted with the opposition. He gave up his seat in 1818 and resumed service in the Mediterranean until retiring on half pay in 1821. He had been made KCMG on 26 February 1820 and re-entered parliament, for Berwickshire, in 1826, where he gave a general support to government. On 24 March 1831 he defended an anti-reform petition from Berwickshire. In August 1830 he had become naval aide-de-camp to William IV and he was made KMG on 6 April 1832. That year he lost his parliamentary election. He retained his aideship under Queen Victoria until 1841 when he obtained flag rank. He became an admiral in 1857 and on 22 August 1860 succeeded his brother James as tenth earl of Lauderdale and third baron. He became GCB on 10 November 1862 and died unmarried at Thirlestane Castle on 22 March 1863, thereby extinguishing the barony. He was succeeded in the earldom by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17837/', "Thomas Maitland (1803&#150;1878)")</script>.<br>
