<span class="headword">Chaplin,  Sidney <span class="st"> [Sid]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 September 1916 at 23 Bolckow Street, Shildon, co. Durham, one of the several children of Isaiah (Ike) Chaplin (1895&#150;1969), colliery electrician, and his wife, Elsie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Charlton (1896&#150;1979). Chaplin attended several village schools and became, in 1931, an apprentice blacksmith at Dean and Chapter colliery, Ferryhill. Though he had no formal secondary education, he attended Workers' Educational Association classes at the Spennymoor settlement and, in January 1939, took up a scholarship to Fircroft Working Men's College, Selly Oak, Birmingham, which was cut short by the outbreak of war, when he returned to work in the coal mines in co. Durham. From 1938 to 1948 he was a Methodist lay preacher and although thereafter he had no close involvement with any church, he retained a strong interest in spiritual matters.<br>
<br>It was early in this period that Chaplin began to write, his efforts intensifying on his enforced return to his roots. He married Irene Rutherford (<i>b</i>. 1920) on 1 January 1941, and they went on to have a daughter and two sons. His poems and stories in <span class="italic">Penguin New Writing</span> attracted attention and, when Phoenix House publishers was founded, Chaplin was invited to submit enough short stories for a volume. They made up his first book, <span class="italic">The Leaping Lad</span> (1946), which became a marker for a younger generation of writers from the industrial north of England who were to emerge in the late 1950s, among them John Braine, Alan Sillitoe, David Storey, and Stan Barstow.<br>
<br>The offer of a job as reporter on the new National Coal Board magazine <span class="italic">Coal</span> brought Chaplin freedom from pit-work, while his assignments for the publication would take him underground in every coalfield in England, Scotland, and Wales. For four years (1953&#150;7) he worked from an office in London; then, still employed by the NCB, he returned to the north-east and settled in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, where he lived until his death.<br>
<br>Chaplin was a man of warmth and sincerity, with a lack of pretentiousness which could be misleading, as could his acknowledgement of the oral roots of his story-telling, which gave little hint of the range of his prose technique. The four full-length novels he wrote in the rich creative period following his arrival in Newcastle are impressive for the variety of their narrative tone; the two in which he described young protagonists making their way in a changing working-class environment (<span class="italic">The Day of the Sardine</span>, 1961, and <span class="italic">The Watchers and the Watched</span>, 1962) being especially enviable for the insight and confidence with which the texture of life in the author's adopted city is rendered. While these books brought him a wider audience, it was ironic that they came at a time when the film-makers had recently had their fill of life in northern factories and back streets, and Chaplin, the forerunner, missed out on the richer pickings some of his younger contemporaries had enjoyed, though added prestige came with the Alan Plater and Alex Glasgow stage musical <span class="italic">Close the Coalhouse Door</span> (1968), based on Chaplin's <span class="italic">The Thin Seam</span> and other stories.<br>
<br>Public acknowledgement of Chaplin's achievements began to accumulate: an honorary fellowship of Sunderland Polytechnic in 1977, an honorary MA from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1978. In the new year honours of 1977 he was made an OBE for his work for the arts in the north-east. When people come once again to celebrate the warmth and dignity, the courage and comradeship which were the best qualities of the half-century of industrial life and its decline that Chaplin made his subject, his work will be found to have a true and lasting place in the tapestry of witness.<br>
<br>After a heart attack in 1973, Chaplin suffered two years of pain and discomfort until a heart bypass operation which nearly killed him gave him a new lease of life. On 10 January 1986 he died suddenly of another heart attack at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Grasmere, while participating in a literary weekend at Wordsworth's Dove Cottage. He was survived by his wife, and was buried in Jesmond old cemetery, Newcastle upon Tyne. The posthumously published <span class="italic">In Blackberry Time</span> (1987) is a biographical sequence of some of Chaplin's shorter pieces interspersed with comment by his son Michael.<br>
