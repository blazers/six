<span class="headword">Phipps,  George Augustus Constantine</span>, second marquess of Normanby  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 23 July 1819 at Portland Place, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22187/', "Constantine Henry Phipps, first marquess of Normanby (1797&#150;1863)")</script>, and Maria Liddell (1798&#150;1882). He was styled Viscount Normanby from 1831 to 1838, and then earl of Mulgrave until 1863. He was an ensign in the Scots Fusilier Guards (1838&#150;43), major in the North Yorkshire militia (1846&#150;53), honorary colonel of the Tower Hamlets rifle volunteers (1868), deputy lieutenant of Yorkshire (1844), and high steward of Hull. On 17 August 1844 he married Laura (1816&#150;1885), the daughter of Captain Robert Russell RN. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In July 1847 Mulgrave was elected whig MP for Scarborough, but was defeated in July 1851 on presenting himself for re-election on accepting office as comptroller of the (royal) household. He was, however, returned for Scarborough in 1852 and 1857. In the late 1840s he was a Liberal whip in the House of Commons for Lord John Russell, and during the 1850s served as a whip under Aberdeen and Palmerston. He was sworn of the privy council in 1851 and was treasurer of the household from 1853 to 1858.<br>
<br>Mulgrave was in January 1858 appointed lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia, the first British colony to have been granted responsible government (1848). There were few established parliamentary conventions, and politics was fought by ferociously personalized factions rather than disciplined parties. The refusal of the Conservative ministry to resign after its election defeat in 1859 caused Mulgrave difficulties; a year later his refusal of a dissolution to the Conservatives resulted in the formation of a Liberal administration. Having had limited success in tempering Nova Scotian politics with the forbearance and training of Westminster, he returned to England on his father's death and resigned his appointment in September 1863.<br>
<br>Normanby held strong opinions about the duty of parliamentary attendance by members of the House of Lords holding official posts. Russell in May 1866 appointed him lord-in-waiting, but he went out of office with the Liberals two months later. In December 1868, when he accepted the same post from Gladstone, and again in 1869 on his promotion to captain of the corps of gentleman-at-arms, he indicated his preference &#145;to make the Colonial service my profession&#146;  (Normanby to Gladstone, 13 Dec 1869, BL, Add. MS 44423, fol. 302). He became a member of the provisional committee of the Royal Colonial Institute in 1868, and was afterwards vice-president. He was not a rich marquess and colonial work was financially attractive: his Yorkshire estates, which amounted to 6834 acres, yielded &pound;7000 in 1883, when his annual salary as a colonial governor was &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>In April 1871 Normanby was named governor of Queensland. No sensations were associated with him there, though a speech in 1872 about illegally imported Polynesian labour in its sugar-growing district is satirized by Samuel Butler in <span class="italic">Erewhon</span>. He travelled widely in Queensland, where the Normanby and Mulgrave Rivers are named after him. Cardwell suggested his succession to Dufferin in Canada in 1873, and Normanby was disappointed not to receive this post. &#145;Though not a man of great ability, he had sound judgement, abundant tact, robust common sense, and an imperturbable temper&#146;  (des Voeux, 1.145).<br>
<br>Normanby assumed the governorship of New Zealand in December 1874. After the radical Sir George Grey became prime minister in 1877, the two men clashed in a series of constitutional disputes in which Normanby demonstrated keen political instincts and a strict sense of his duty. He refused to confirm an appointment to the legislative council recommended by Grey on the grounds that a vote of no confidence was pending in the council. Later he declined Grey's advice to dissolve the assembly until every expedient had been tried to secure a working majority. Normanby, who was following practices agreed by the Australian governors, strained his prerogatives to Grey's disadvantage. The contest for supremacy between the two men was watched with interest in other self-governing colonies.<br>
<br>In 1879 Normanby became governor of Victoria. Notable incidents during his governorship included the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880, his confirmation of the death sentence on Ned Kelly, a visit in 1881 by the two sons of the prince of Wales, during which he was anxious for their safety, and a dispute with the premier, Graham Berry, after Normanby declined to dissolve the Victorian parliament&#151;thus enabling Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's stop-gap ministry to take office (1881). Again Normanby proved a confident interpreter of constitutional practice who mistrusted the scruples of reformers. In Melbourne he was considered a parsimonious host: &#145;his easy-going, listless manner conveyed the impression of indifference, but he was well posted in the traditions of his office&#146;  (Turner, 2.210). Opinions varied in London: &#145;He has done very well and is exceptionally popular&#146;, judged Lord Derby  (Derby to Gladstone, 10 July 1883, BL, Add. MS 44141); according to Granville, &#145;Normanby is a very good fellow, but he is much unlikely to make a figure&#146;  (minute of 2 July 1884, BL, Add. MS 44768, fols. 59&#150;60).<br>
<br>As his wife was dying, Normanby left Australia in April 1884 and retired from public office on a pension in August. He believed that his experiences as a House of Commons whip had fitted him for the political duties of a colonial governor. His assertiveness on constitutional issues reflected his wish to bring the practices and discipline of the Westminster parliament to colonial assemblies. He himself said in 1884 that, when facing difficult decisions as a governor, he had always asked himself, &#145;What would they think upon this question in the House of Commons?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute</span>, 363&#150;4). He admired the constructive energy and initiative of the colonists, and in 1887&#150;8 revisited Australia for pleasure. He had a genial face and (perhaps partly as a result of his whip's training) was a terse public speaker. He took a close interest in his tenantry, liked race meetings, and often drove his coach at a furious gallop with only inches to spare through the back gates of Government House in Melbourne.<br>
<br>Normanby was created KCMG in 1874, GCMG in 1877, and GCB in 1885. He resigned the chairmanship of Whitby Liberal Association after Gladstone's declaration for home rule. He died on 3 April 1890, at 6 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton, and was buried at St Oswald's Church, Lythe, near Whitby, Yorkshire, on 9 April.<br>
