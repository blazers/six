<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawe,  George</span>  (1781&#150;1829), <span class="occ">history and portrait painter</span>, was born on 6 February 1781 in Brewer Street, Golden Square, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7330/', "Philip Dawe (1745?&#150;1809?)")</script>, a mezzotint engraver, and his wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1832). He was brought up in a creative family: his two younger brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7329/', "Henry Edward Dawe (1790&#150;1848)")</script> and James Philip Dawe (1794&#150;1879), and their sister, Mary Margaret Dawe (1785&#150;1871), were all professional artists. Dawe, who was named after his godfather, the genre painter George Morland, started his career as a mezzotint engraver. He practised as an engraver for at least twenty-four years&#151;his first plates after John Graham's originals were published in 1795 and one of his latest engravings, after his portrait of the duke of Wellington, was made in London in April 1818. In 1794 at the age of thirteen he entered the Royal Academy Schools, and in 1803 received the gold medal for <span class="italic">Achilles, Frantic for the Loss of Patroclus, Rejecting the Consolation of Thetis</span> (Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington), which was regarded by contemporaries as &#145;the best ever offered to the Academy on a similar occasion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arnold's Library of the Fine Arts</span>, 1831, 1, 10). In 1804 he sent to the Royal Academy <span class="italic">Naomi and her Daughters</span> (Tate collection); five years later he was elected an associate and in 1814 he was elected Royal Academician, submitting <span class="italic">Demoniac</span> (RA, London) as his diploma work. Dawe had also had strong professional links with the British Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom since its foundation in 1806. In 1807, for example, he was depicted by A. E. Chalon in a group portrait of artists in one of the rooms of the British Institution (British Museum), and exhibited there regularly until 1813. Dawe's reputation as a history and subject painter began to increase significantly. His <span class="italic">Scene from Cymbeline</span> (exhibited with the title &#145;Imogen Found at the Cave of Belarius&#146; (1808; Tate collection; a version in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington) was awarded a special premium at the British Institution and was praised by S. T. Coleridge in a letter to Sir George Beaumont of 7 December 1811  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</span>, ed. F. L. Griggs, 1959, 3.844&#150;5). Both this painting and <span class="italic">Andromache Imploring Ulysses to Spare the Life of her Son</span> (1810; sketches in a priv. coll., London, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington) were bought by the collector Thomas Hope. Dawe's <span class="italic">A Negro Overpowering a Buffalo</span> also obtained a premium at the British Institution in 1811. The following year his large picture <span class="italic">Genevieve</span> (now known as &#145;Lady and the Harper&#146;), signed and dated 1812 (Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington), based on (in the view of Charles James Fox) &#145;the most pleasing poem in the English language&#146; by Coleridge entitled &#145;Love&#146;, was exhibited at the Royal Academy  (Coburn, ed., <span class="italic">Coleridge</span>, 3, n. 4142). Paintings exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811 and 1813 enhanced his reputation. These included: <span class="italic">Philip Howorth as the Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpent</span> (known through an engraving by Henry Dawe, 1812; impression, V&amp;A), inspired by a work on the same subject by Sir Joshua Reynolds, <span class="italic">Hercules Strangling the Serpent</span>, painted for Catherine the Great of Russia and delivered to St Petersburg in 1789, where it remains, and <span class="italic">Mother Rescuing her Child from an Eagle's Nest</span>, based on a Scottish legendary story. A further noteworthy subject picture by Dawe is a huge allegorical panorama or illuminated transparency for Vauxhall (1814), a critical account of which was included by Charles Lamb in his recollections.<br>
<br>One of Dawe's earliest portraits is of Sir Samuel Romilly (<i>c</i>.1806), and as a portrait painter Dawe soon acquired a respectable clientele. Following the appearance of his wonderful portrait of Mrs White (1809; sold by Christies in 1994 at a high price), which was compared by contemporaries with the best works of Sir Thomas Lawrence and Jacques-Louis David, he received commissions for several family portraits from Thomas Hope, and attained wide recognition. His full-length portrait of the actress Eliza O'Neill as Juliet was a great public success. In the summer of 1815 Dawe had briefly employed John Constable, with whom he had been acquainted since 1806, to paint in the background, and this theatrical scene, full of romantic atmosphere achieved by the effect of glittering lamplight, stirred public opinion when exhibited both in London (1816) and later in St Petersburg (1827), where it was taken by Dawe with other good examples of his professional skill. With the execution of portraits of members of the royal family&#151;Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold, later king of the Belgians, who married in 1816&#151;which became quite popular throughout Europe in engravings, Dawe achieved the status of court painter. Under the patronage of Edward, duke of Kent, Dawe travelled on the continent as part of his retinue visiting Paris, Cambrai, Brussels, and Aix-la-Chapelle, where a congress of representatives of the member states of the grand alliance against France took place. In the autumn of 1818 while working at Aix on a portrait of Prince Volkonsky, Dawe was noticed by Alexander I and invited to go to St Petersburg to paint, on very profitable terms, more than 300 portraits of Russian generals who had distinguished themselves in the war against the emperor Napoleon I. The circumstances of such a flattering invitation were described in a first-hand account in the memoirs of a military historian, Aleksandr Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky, published in Russia in 1897.<br>
<br>Dawe travelled to the Russian capital via Germany, where in Weimar he had portrayed Goethe (Goethe Museum, Weimar) and discussed with him his essay on the theory of colour then in preparation for publication. Staying in Russia for about ten years (from spring 1819 to May 1828, and again briefly in spring 1829) Dawe founded a &#145;portrait factory&#146;, confirming his reputation as an international painter who was prolific and rapid in production. For five years, until the completion of most of the <span class="roman">Military Gallery</span> (opened in the Winter Palace in December 1826 and now part of the Hermitage collection), Dawe's studio, including his brother Henry and brother-in-law Thomas Wright (who married Mary Margaret Dawe in St Petersburg in 1825), issued many engravings after the originals which were painted by Dawe himself with the assistance of two Russian apprentices, A. Polyakov and V.-A. Golicke. The engravings were protected by copyright, granted to Dawe by the emperor. About 400 military and not less than 100 high-society portraits associated with the name of Dawe while he was working out of England have been traced through different sources. Many can be identified in J. Bennet and T. Wright's engraving of 1826 of <span class="italic">The Visit of Emperor Alexander I to the Studio of Dawe</span>. The artist had an unparalleled success in Russia: in the winter of 1826 he held a solo exhibition in Moscow; Nicholas I chose him as court painter for the coronation ceremony of the same year; in 1820 Dawe was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg, where in 1827 he was allowed to exhibit 150 portraits. The next year he was appointed the first portrait painter at court and in 1829 accompanied Grand Duke Constantine to Warsaw. Among his admirers was the poet Aleksandr Pushkin, who wrote a poem entitled &#145;To Dawe Esq.&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Complete Works of Alexander Pushkin</span>, 1999&#150;; in English). Dawe's work was widely discussed by the Russian press and public; a reviewer praised &#145;the effectiveness of his pictorial approach&#146; and capacity &#145;to seize a likeness&#146;  ([N. Gretch], <span class="italic">Syn Otechestva</span>, 34&#150;40, 1820, 299&#150;300, 302) and criticized for a superficial attitude to the sitter, rough manner, and readiness to paint &#145;fashionable little portraits for big money&#146; (N. Gogol, <span class="italic">Portret</span> 1835; N. Gogol, &#145;The Portrait&#146;, in <span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1984, 536). In practice Dawe varied the compositional formulas of military and society portraits employed by contemporary Russian artists such as V. Tropinin, O. Kiprensky, and K. Bryullov. Under the influence of his painting <span class="italic">Mother Rescuing her Child from an Eagle's Nest</span>, which Dawe brought with him to St Petersburg, A. Orlovsky (in 1828) and M. Markov (in 1833) painted versions of the same subject.<br>
<br>Among the best portraits painted by Dawe in Russia are those of Barclay de Tolly and Admiral Shishkov (both in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg); the young Countess Stroganov (Alupka Palace, Alupka, Crimea), and the Mezhakov family (Vologda Art Gallery, Vologda). Known for his remarkable industry and diverse interests, Dawe studied anatomy, psychology, and languages. He had a fine collection of old masters; studied the theory of colours and the technique of famous artists, and wrote a lively book about George Morland  (<span class="italic">The Life of George Morland, with Remarks on his Works</span>, 1807). While living in Russia, he travelled throughout the country and tried to use the Russian language.<br>
<br>On his first return to England, Dawe brought with him several Russian portraits and in November 1828 showed them at Windsor Castle. From November 1828 to February 1829, during his journey back to Russia, Dawe visited, and was kindly received at, the courts of Germany and France. In August 1829 the artist returned permanently to London, and died, unmarried, a few months later on 15 October at his home, 22 Fortess Terrace, Kentish Town, London. On 27 October he was buried with honours in St Paul's Cathedral. The works of Dawe can be found in many public and private collections in different countries of Europe, as well as in Russia, the United States of America, and New Zealand (where his sister, Caroline Dawe, emigrated with her family following her marriage to Michael Prendergast).<br>
