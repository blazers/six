<span class="headword">Day,  Thomas</span>  (1748&#150;1789), <span class="occ">author and political campaigner</span>, was born on 22 June 1748 in Wellclose Square, London, the only child of Thomas Day (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1749) and his wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1728&#150;1796), daughter of Samuel Bonham, a City merchant. His father, deputy collector outwards of the customs of the port of London, died when young Thomas was no more than a year old, leaving him with a massive fortune in trust until he came of age. He attended a school at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, but after recovering from smallpox became a boarder at Charterhouse (1757&#150;64). From Charterhouse he went to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he studied classics, became a member of a select debating society and close friend of William Jones, but left without a degree in 1767. He enrolled at the Middle Temple in 1765.<br>
<br>While living at Barehill, Berkshire, with his mother and stepfather, Thomas Phillips, Day became great friends with an ardently progressive neighbour, Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Edgeworth, an enthusiastic disciple of Rousseau, had resolved to educate his son Dick in accordance with the precepts of <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span>, and Day became a kindred spirit in the great experiment. The more he learned of Rousseau, the more excited he became. Were all the world's books destroyed, he declared in 1769, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span> were the two he would save. He accompanied Edgeworth and young Dick on a trip to Ireland and, later, on a visit to Rousseau.<br>
<br>During all this time, however, Day was also in search of a wife. A large, swarthy, gloomy, heavy-lidded and rather ungainly young man, his face severely pockmarked and his hair rarely combed, Day was not the ideal suitor. In quick succession he fell in love with Edgeworth's sister, with an unknown &#145;lady of the west&#146;, and, during a prolonged stay in Lichfield, with two sisters&#151;each of whom resisted his blandishments. Day decided that, if his ideal woman did not exist, she would have to be created. In 1769 he adopted, with scant regard for legal niceties, two girls from foundling hospitals and secretly bore them off to France to see which of them he could educate (in accordance with Rousseau's ideas) into becoming a suitable wife for himself. One, whom he renamed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104873/', "Sabrina Sidney")</script>, seemed promising, and in 1770 he brought her back to Stowe House, near Lichfield, for special tuition. But after conducting some extraordinary experiments to test her hardiness, which included dropping hot sealing wax on her arm and firing a pistol at her skirts, Day concluded that she was insufficiently phlegmatic. He cast her off with a small allowance and declared that he wished never to see her again. Sabrina would later marry Day's friend John Bicknell.<br>
<br>Day joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59220', "Lunar Society of Birmingham")</script>, a circle of scientists, chemists, and inventors presided over by Erasmus Darwin, which included Matthew Boulton (to whom he lent considerable sums of money), Josiah Wedgwood, and James Keir (his first biographer). He also met the leading lady of Lichfield, Anna Seward, a young poet. Initially Anna was a confidante, and recipient of some of his lengthiest letters, but in later years (mainly because of his friendship with Edgeworth) became a violent enemy. In 1804 she wrote a vicious and inaccurate account of him which besmirched his reputation, particularly with regard to his supposed treatment of his wife, as well as revealing the identity and whereabouts of his former pupil, Sabrina Sidney.<br>
<br>With John Bicknell, in 1773, Day wrote <span class="italic">The Dying Negro</span>, a long and harrowing poem narrating the tale of a runaway slave, which proved a best-seller. In that same year, after some eighteen months in France, Day began legal studies at the Middle Temple. He shared rooms with William Jones and refused the latter's celebrated command to kill a spider, on the grounds that he had no right to do so and that such instructions created alarming precedents. He was called to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1779 and acquired chambers at Furnival's Inn although his subsequent legal practice, if not totally non-existent, was minimal.<br>
<br>Day's exacting standards for the ideal wife were met in Esther Milnes (1752&#150;1792), an heiress from Chesterfield, the daughter of Richard Milnes (1705&#150;1757), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1757). He and Esther were married at Bath on 7 August 1778. While not totally submerging her own personality, and doubtless distressed at having to surrender her poetry, harpsichord, and friends to comply with her husband's demands, Esther proved a satisfactory soulmate, and their marriage was close and loving. They settled in 1779 on a small estate at Stapleford Abbotts, near Abridge in Essex, although it proved singularly dismal and non-productive. The Days were to have no children, though Thomas Lowndes, Esther's nephew, became for all practical purposes their adopted heir.<br>
<br>Day strongly supported the American colonists in their independence struggle and his poem <span class="italic">The Devoted Legions</span> (1776) was a scathing indictment of the government's actions. In 1780, caught up in England's short-lived revolutionary movement, he delivered three ringing speeches in favour of an early peace and parliamentary reform. They were published as pamphlets and it seemed that a new John Hampden had appeared on the scene. He declined invitations to stand for parliament and accept a government post, but acted as unpaid private secretary to Henry Laurens, an American congressman involved in the peace negotiations. He continued to publish political reflections including the partial text of a letter written to a plantation owner in 1776. &#145;If there be an object truly ridiculous in Nature&#146;, he declared, &#145;it is an American patriot signing resolutions of independency with one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1780 Day purchased an estate at Anningsley, in Surrey, where he and Esther took up full-time residence in 1783. They ran it primarily as a philanthropic concern, with the bodily and spiritual welfare of its workers and their families of paramount importance. In desolate surroundings, they laboured to create a new Jerusalem. A pioneer in every sense, Day was not only conscious of the hazards of air pollution, and a campaigner for land reclamation, but an early exponent of afforestation.<br>
<br>Day had meanwhile made an astonishing reputation as a writer of instructive fiction for children. <span class="italic">The History of Little Jack</span> (1787), a tale for the very young, enjoyed great success. But his most famous production, destined to be a best-seller for eighty years, was <span class="italic">Sandford and Merton</span>. Published in three volumes (1783, 1786, and 1789), it tells how rebellious Tommy Merton, the spoilt son of a wealthy plantation owner from Jamaica, and his friend Harry Sandford, the poor but worthy son of a local farmer, are patiently educated by the Revd Mr Barlow&#151;and how Master Tommy is brought, by precept and self-discovery, to see the error of his ways. A host of interpolated stories, providing introductions to ancient history, astronomy, biology, science, exploration, and geography, enable facts and figures to be absorbed relatively painlessly but the main narrative easily holds the attention. Rousseau's deductive techniques are deployed to good effect. What comes through is the basic Christian (and early socialist) message that the members of society should be kind not only to each other but also to the poor and the sick, to those of a different race, and to animals, birds, and insects. They should labour to the best of their ability and contribute to a common pool of goods and happiness. But for the idle rich, particularly those who wear fine clothes, play cards, and treat lesser mortals with contempt, the author has no mercy. The book, however sententious, would play a crucial role in moulding the ethos of nineteenth-century England.<br>
<br>A holder and practitioner of strange ideas, a perpetual optimist and a profound pessimist, a philanthropist and a misanthrope, an opponent of organized charity but a soft touch for those on the cadge, a preacher and an iconoclast, and above all a recluse who found it almost impossible to keep out of the limelight, Day was a strange bundle of contradictions. Sometimes lonely and bitter, but endeavouring always to obey the dictates of his conscience, he was a man deeply loved and respected by most of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Day was thrown from his horse at Barehill, Berkshire, on 28 September 1789 and died almost instantly. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Wargrave, Berkshire, on 6 October 1789. Esther, distraught, survived him by less than three years.<br>
