<span class="headword">Stewart <span class="st"> [Stuart]</span>, Sir  John, of Darnley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1380&#150;1429), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, belonged to a middling Scottish baronial family (distant cadets of the main house of Stewart) whose estates lay in Renfrewshire and north Lanarkshire. He succeeded his father, Sir Alexander Stewart, as lord of Darnley in 1404, but had not been knighted by January 1418. In October 1419, however, now a knight, he was one of the leaders, along with John Stewart, earl of Buchan, and Archibald Douglas, earl of Wigtown, of the Scottish expeditionary force that travelled to France to help oppose the advancing process of English conquest there. By August 1420 Stewart was being referred to as constable of the Scottish army in France, and he was prominently involved in the Franco-Scottish victory at Baug&eacute; on 22 March 1421 in which the duke of Clarence was killed and the English military advance on the Loire consequently halted. Stewart continued to play a large part in the continental war in the following years, for instance capturing John de la Pole, lieutenant of Normandy, early in 1423. On 31 July of the same year Stewart was himself captured and lost an eye in the heavy Franco-Scottish defeat at Cravant. The Scottish forces serving in France at this time seem generally to have been received locally with some ambivalence, but the reaction to Stewart's activities was apparently particularly favourable. Some of the many honours bestowed by the French crown upon Stewart may have done him little material good, such as the award of the countship of &Eacute;vreux in 1427, which was then entirely in English hands, or the right to quarter his own arms with the French royal arms. But there is an indication of high esteem in these gestures; and grants to Stewart of the castellany of Concressault in 1421 and of the seigneury of Aubigny in 1422 were honours with a tangible value. A substantial financial contribution and the exchange of a prominent captive, meanwhile, were measures undertaken by the French crown to help meet what was clearly a large ransom incurred by Stewart after Cravant.<br>
<br>Stewart was also trusted to undertake diplomatic initiatives on behalf of Charles VII of France, and returned to Scotland in 1428 on an embassy in the company of the French chancellor, Reynaud de Chartres, archbishop of Rheims. The embassy resulted in the renewal of the Franco-Scottish alliance and agreement regarding the marriage of Margaret, daughter of James I, with the dauphin Louis, the future Louis XI. The main theme of Stewart's career, though, was to remain his military exploits and the rewards and renown he was able to achieve through them. His military success was reflected in literature, which saw him lauded as a chivalric model as far away as Spain, and in a mystery play concerning the siege of Orl&eacute;ans. Stewart's relationship with the urban community of Orl&eacute;ans was particularly close. He made a collegiate foundation there, and it was while active in the defence of Orl&eacute;ans that he met his death during an encounter with English forces at Rouvray on 12 February 1429. He was accorded the honour of burial within the cathedral church of Orl&eacute;ans.<br>
<br>Stewart married Elizabeth Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1429), younger daughter and coheir of Duncan, eighth earl of Lennox. After Stewart's death the senior branch of the family, represented by his eldest son, Alan, who returned to Scotland, was ultimately to acquire the earldom of Lennox. Stewart's second son, another <a name="cosubject_54329"></a><span class="headword">John Stewart</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1469)<span class="occ"></span>, remained in France and succeeded his father as seigneur d'Aubigny. He and his descendants were to be unusually successful in retaining grants obtained from the French crown, perhaps partly due to the determination of the elder John Stewart's widow, Elizabeth, but also to the standing Stewart had achieved in France. The younger John Stewart, who in 1446 married B&eacute;atrice Apchier, daughter of B&eacute;rault, seigneur d'Apchier, like his father was a soldier in French royal armies, and was created a knight of Louis XI's order of St Michel. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26694/', "B&#233;rault Stuart [Bernard Stewart]")</script>, would in turn establish a formidable international military reputation at the turn of the fifteenth century.<br>
