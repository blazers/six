<span class="headword">Warren,  John</span>  (1730&#150;1800), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, was born on 12 May 1730 at Cavendish, Suffolk, the second son of Richard Warren (1681&#150;1748), archdeacon of Suffolk, and Priscilla (<i>d</i>. 1774), daughter of John Fenner. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28788/', "Richard Warren (1731&#150;1797)")</script>, was physician to George III. He was educated for seven years at Bury St Edmunds grammar school, and admitted a sizar of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 6 July 1747. On this foundation he was a scholar from 1747 to 1754, and from it he graduated BA as seventh wrangler in 1750; he proceeded MA in 1754 and gained the member's prize in 1753. He was ordained deacon on 17 June 1753, and took priest's orders on 26 May 1754. Warren was then presented to the rectory of Leverington in the Isle of Ely, and became chaplain to Edmund Keene, bishop of Ely, who collated him to the rectory of Teversham in Cambridgeshire. He was appointed to the seventh prebend of Ely on 23 January 1768, and the same day, upon his resigning Teversham, he was appointed to the rectory of Nailwell in Cambridgeshire. He acted for some time as chaplain to Lord Sondes, and later as chaplain and secretary to Matthias Mawson, bishop of Ely. In 1772 he proceeded to the degree of DD in the University of Cambridge. He married, on 12 April 1777, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of Henry Southwell of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, who brought him a considerable fortune.<br>
<br>Nominated to the bishopric of St David's on 3 August 1779, on the translation of James Yorke to Gloucester, on 15 May 1783 Warren was elected to the see of Bangor on the advancement of John Moore to be archbishop of Canterbury. A strict high-churchman, he was a prelate of the greatest application to business. Warren was described by the historian of St David's diocese as a &#145;gifted and determined administrator&#146;  (Thomas, 66), and his undoubted talents, candour, and integrity clearly recommended themselves to Lord Chancellor Thurlow: indeed, it was said that no one was more in Thurlow's confidence than Warren  (Mather, 129, n. 65).<br>
<br>As this implies, Warren was, in politics, a strong supporter of the government during the Napoleonic wars and he voted for its proposals to suspend habeas corpus in 1794. His support of the government, combined with his attention to detail and well-developed business sense lay behind the fact that he was chairman of committees on private bills in the House of Lords for most of the 1790s  (Mather, 143). He was not shy of using his position to defend the interests of his family: he was chosen chairman of the committee when the House of Lords threw out the bill of the Company of Surgeons in 1797. His appointment was no doubt due to the high position his brother occupied in the medical profession. Warren died on 27 January 1800 at his house in George Street, Westminster, and was buried on 10 February in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey. He published, besides various sermons, <span class="italic">The Duties of the Parochial Clergy</span> (1785).<br>
