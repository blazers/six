<span class="headword">Bosanquet,  Charles</span>  (1769&#150;1850), <span class="occ">merchant and writer</span>, was born at Forest House, Leyton, Essex, on 23 July 1769, the second son of Samuel Bosanquet (1744&#150;1806), a Huguenot merchant, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1819), the daughter of Henry Lannoy Hunter of Beechill, Berkshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2929/', "John Bernard Bosanquet")</script> was a younger brother. When he was seven he was sent to school in Hackney, then from the ages of sixteen to eighteen he was placed in a merchant's house in Lyons. Later, in partnership with J. P. Anderson, he went into the West Indian trade. At the height of the City's fears of attack from France, in 1794, he was gazetted lieutenant of the London and Westminster light horse volunteers. By 1796 he wrote, &#145;considering myself as well established both in income and respectability, I paid my addresses to Miss Charlotte Holford&#146;  (Lee, 81). On 1 June 1796 he married Charlotte Anne (<i>d</i>. 1839), the daughter of Peter Holford, a master in chancery; a son and six daughters were born, but five of the daughters died in infancy or youth.<br>
<br>From 1809 Bosanquet was a member of Lloyds (he was also a member of the committee of its patriotic fund) and in 1814 he became trustee to William Balston's paper manufactory. He was sub-governor of the South Sea Company from 1808 to 1838, then governor until 1850. He was appointed a director of the West India Company, which was set up in 1825 to relieve the economic plight of planters in the British Caribbean. He also played an active public role; from 1823 to 1836 he was chairman of the exchequer bill office, and he was governor of the Canadian Land Company and instrumental in bringing vast tracts of land in western Canada into cultivation.<br>
<br>Bosanquet wrote four economic pamphlets, chiefly relating to the sugar and rum trade of the British Caribbean. These included <span class="italic">A letter on the proposition submitted to government for taking the duty on muscovado sugar ad valorem</span> (1806) and <span class="italic">A Letter to W. Manning, Esq., MP, on the Depreciation of West India Property</span> (2nd edn, 1807), in which he argued against proposals to tax sugar on the basis of quality and against the discriminatory duties which protected the British Caribbean monopoly of the home market. He advocated the sole use of British West India rum by domestic distilleries and by the navy to boost sales and to exclude foreign competition. His <span class="italic">Thoughts on the value to Great Britain of commerce in general, and the colonial trade in particular</span> (1807) asserted the importance and profitability of the West India trade, to which William Spence replied in <span class="italic">Radical Cause of the Present Distresses of West India Planters Pointed out</span> (1807). His <span class="italic">Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee</span> (2nd edn, with supplement, 1810) ranks among the most effective statements of the anti-bullionist position and provoked a brilliant rebuttal, which was later upheld as a model essay on political economy, by David Ricardo in <span class="italic">Reply to Mr Bosanquet's Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee</span> (1811).<br>
<br>Bosanquet acquired in 1804 a London residence at The Firs, Hampstead, and the former Holford estate at Rock in Northumberland, the gift of his brother-in-law Richard Holford, with its large manor house which had been badly damaged by fire. He set about restoring the house, which served as a summer retreat until his retirement from business, when it became his permanent home. In 1828 he was high sheriff of Northumberland, where he was also justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant. He owned the living of Bolingbroke with Hareby in Lincolnshire, together with stock in the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, and his bequests included &pound;19,000-worth of annuities in the South Sea Company. In old age he underwent treatment for cataract. He died at Rock on 20 June 1850 and was buried in the church there, monuments being placed there and at Hampstead. He was survived by his son, the Revd Robert William Bosanquet, and his daughter Mary Anne, the wife of the Revd Robert Fielde.<br>
