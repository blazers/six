<span class="headword">Maud,  John Primatt Redcliffe</span>, Baron Redcliffe-Maud  (1906&#150;1982), <span class="occ">public servant</span>, was born on 3 February 1906 at Bristol, the younger son and last of the six children of the Revd John Primatt Maud (1860&#150;1932), then vicar of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and later bishop of Kensington, and his wife, Elizabeth Diana, eldest daughter of Canon Charles Wellington Furse, archdeacon of Westminster and rector of St John's, Smith Square, London.<br>
<br>Maud was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford; as a king's scholar at Eton College (of which he was a fellow, 1964&#150;76); and as a scholar at New College, Oxford, where he won a second in classical honour moderations (1926) and a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1928). In 1929, after a year studying economics at Harvard, he was appointed a junior research fellow in politics at University College, Oxford&#151;the first full-time politics don to be appointed in Oxford&#151;and made his speciality the subject of local government. Johannesburg invited him to write a history of its local government, and a visit in 1932 was to establish a lifelong link with South Africa. He became a tutorial fellow at University College in 1932, and dean in 1933.<br>
<br>In 1939 Maud was appointed master of Birkbeck College, London. The war broke out just as he took up his appointment, but he managed until 1943 to combine the mastership with work as a temporary civil servant, for a few months in the office of the regional commissioner for the southern region of England, and then in the Ministry of Food. When Lord Woolton became minister of food in April 1940 he chose Maud to be his principal private secretary. Maud's rise thereafter was rapid: to deputy secretary in 1941 and second secretary in 1944, when he moved with Woolton to the newly formed office of the Ministry of Reconstruction, at first as its deputy head and soon, when Norman Brook became secretary of the cabinet, its head.<br>
<br>Maud was so evidently fitted for the public service that he was invited to continue in it after the war ended. Still only thirty-eight, he was appointed permanent secretary to the Ministry of Education in 1945. This appointment engaged his concern for education as well as his knowledge of local government, and called for all his qualities of administrative skill, persuasiveness, and enthusiasm. In this period he was one of the founding fathers of UNESCO.<br>
<br>In 1952 Maud became permanent secretary at the Ministry of Fuel and Power. The main thrust of policy during his time was to reduce dependence on coal by increasing the substitution of oil for coal and developing alternative energy sources: for Maud the prospects of nuclear power were particularly exciting. In 1956 his attention was diverted for a time to the response to the immediate energy problems created by the closure of the Suez Canal and the need to re-establish the administrative machinery for petrol rationing.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1959 Harold Macmillan asked Maud to go to South Africa as British high commissioner. After South Africa became a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1961 he became the first British ambassador to the new republic. It was the time of Macmillan's &#145;wind of change&#146; speech. Wholly out of sympathy with the South African government's apartheid policies, Maud remained scrupulously correct in his behaviour and pronouncements, without compromising his integrity or betraying his convictions, and came to be widely respected in that country. He combined with his diplomatic appointment that of high commissioner for Swaziland, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland, and worked hard to promote the constitutional, economic, and educational advancement of those territories.<br>
<br>In 1963 the wheel came full circle: Maud returned to University College, to serve as its master until his retirement in 1976. During this time he undertook the chairmanship of a succession of public inquiries on the organization, structure, and management of local government, above all the royal commission on English local government (1966&#150;9); its recommendations for changing the structure of local government proved to be too radical for the 1970&#150;74 government, whose own &#145;reorganization&#146; Maud regarded as a child of no great beauty. But the college came first, and he devoted himself wholeheartedly to its interests and to the welfare of its members. It was not by mere coincidence that under his mastership University College became pre-eminent among Oxford colleges in reputation and success.<br>
<br>Maud's publications included <span class="italic">Local Government in Modern England</span> (1932), <span class="italic">City Government: the Johannesburg Experiment</span> (1938), <span class="italic">English Local Government Reformed</span> (with Bruce Wood, 1974), <span class="italic">Support for the Arts in England and Wales</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Training Musicians</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">Experiences of an Optimist</span> (1981).<br>
<br>Maud was (as he said the ideal permanent secretary should be) discreet, wise, entertaining, and incorruptible; and he had in high degree the traditional attributes of the distinguished public servant: intelligence, high-mindedness, dedication, and a capacity for sustained hard work. He believed in the power of enlightenment to hold back the tide of barbarism, and in the capacity and duty of individual men and women to bring about progress. In these virtues and beliefs he was true to his Christian faith and to the value which he derived from his education. There were some who found all this&#151;combined with his enjoyment of the rewards of his achievements, with his effortless charm and ease of manner, and with his seemingly inexhaustible zest&#151;old-fashioned and even a little too good to be true. There were many others, more responsive to his qualities and in tune with his values, who looked to him for friendship, help, and inspiration, and were never disappointed.<br>
<br>Maud was a fine-looking man: tall, elegant, and distinguished. In his youth he loved and practised the art of acting, and his skill as a performer showed in his later facility as a public speaker and as a broadcaster: he had a gift for combining wisdom and wit in his matter with grace and felicity in his manner.<br>
<br>Music also meant much to Maud&#151;as performer in his younger days as well as listener&#151;though in this part of his life he played a supporting role to his wife, <a href="#cosubject_52282">Jean [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was, and continued to be, a professional pianist. They married on 20 June 1932; and from then on his success and his serenity were sustained by fifty years of close and happy family life. There were four children of the marriage: three daughters (one of whom died in 1941 on the day before her fifth birthday) and a son, Humphrey, who had a distinguished career in the diplomatic service.<br>
<br>Maud was appointed CBE (1942), KCB (1946), and GCB (1955). He was given honorary degrees by the universities of Witwatersrand (1960), Natal (1963), Leeds (1967), Nottingham (1968), and Birmingham (1968). He was FRCM (1964) and an honorary fellow of New College (1964) and University College, Oxford (1976). He was created a life peer in 1967, taking the title of Redcliffe-Maud. He took an active part in the work of the House of Lords, particularly relishing the committee work, until very shortly before his death in Oxford, where he lived, on 20 November 1982.<br>
<br>Maud's wife, <a name="cosubject_52282"></a><span class="headword">(Margaret) Jean Hay Maud</span>, Lady Redcliffe-Maud  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">pianist and hostess</span>, was born on 6 March 1904 in Melrose, Roxburghshire, the younger daughter of John Brown Hamilton, headmaster of St Mary's School, Melrose. Educated at St Mary's School, Melrose, St Leonard's School, the Royal College of Music, and Somerville College, Oxford, she also studied with the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska in Paris and with the pianist and composer Artur Schnabel in Berlin. She became a successful concert pianist. She met Maud in Oxford, and after their marriage she supported his career and continued to perform, entertaining troops and others during the Second World War, playing in London in the 1950s, and performing in South Africa and Oxford for charity. She was also a keen amateur painter and gardener. Between 1989 and 1991 she published four volumes of autobiography, based in part on her letters and diaries. She died in Oxford on 6 November 1993, survived by her son and two daughters.<br>
