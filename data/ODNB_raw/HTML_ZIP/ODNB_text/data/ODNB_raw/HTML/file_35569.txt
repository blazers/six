<span class="headword">Poole,  Stanley Edward  Lane-</span>  (1854&#150;1931), <span class="occ">oriental numismatist and historian</span>, was born in London on 18 December 1854, the elder son of the Arabic scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22512/', "Edward Stanley Poole (1830&#150;1867)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Poole, Sophia Lane")</script>] and his wife, Roberta Elizabeth Louisa, daughter of Charles Reddelien, a naturalized German. Since first their mother then their father died prematurely, he and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35568/', "Reginald Lane Poole (1857&#150;1939)")</script> were brought up by their grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Sophia Lane Poole (1804&#150;1891)")</script> and their great-uncle, the Arabic scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15990/', "Edward William Lane (1801&#150;1876)")</script> in Worthing. They were educated privately under their great-uncle's supervision. Stanley entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1874 and became an exhibitioner in 1875, graduating in 1877 with a third in modern history. This poor result was probably due to his other activities: he had already begun studying oriental coinage with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22520/', "Reginald Stuart Poole (1832&#150;1895)")</script>, keeper of coins and medals in the British Museum, and from 1874 was employed cataloguing the museum's Islamic coins under his uncle's editorship. On the death of his great-uncle in 1876 Lane-Poole undertook to complete his great <span class="italic">Arabic Lexicon</span>, issuing the sixth part, with a memoir of Lane's life, in 1877 and the fragmentary seventh and eighth parts in 1885 and 1893.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1879 Lane-Poole married Charlotte Bell Wilson, second daughter of David Wilson, of Ballymoney, Antrim; they had three sons, the eldest of whom predeceased his father, and a daughter. Lane-Poole remained at the British Museum until 1892, completing the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Oriental Coins</span> (11 vols., 1875&#150;91) and the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Indian Coins</span> (3 vols., 1884&#150;92). At the same time he also catalogued the <span class="italic">Mohammedan Coins Preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford</span> (1888). In 1883 he was sent by the Department of Science and Art on an archaeological mission to Egypt, and in 1886 to Sweden, Russia, and Turkey to study Islamic numismatics. Between 1895 and 1897 he was engaged in archaeological research for the Egyptian government, and catalogued the <span class="italic">Arabic Coins Preserved in the Khedival Library at Cairo</span> (1897). From 1898 until his retirement in 1904 he was professor of Arabic at Trinity College, Dublin, from which he received the degree of DLitt in 1900. In 1901&#150;2 he served as secretary to the Royal Irish Academy, and as examiner in Arabic to the University of Wales.<br>
<br>The years 1875&#150;1903 were very productive for Lane-Poole. Apart from his sixteen volumes of catalogues, he published numerous books on the life and history of the Muslim world, especially Egypt and India, and edited several works of his great-uncle Lane, including the famous translation of <span class="italic">The Thousand and One Nights</span> (1883, 1891, 1906). He also edited some of Jonathan Swift's works, notably his <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span> (1885). In 1885 he edited the biography of his wife's great-uncle, General Francis Rawdon Chesney, and subsequently wrote biographies of other Englishmen associated with the East: Stratford Canning (1888, 1890), Sir Richard Church (1890), Sir Harry Parkes (1894, 1901), and &#145;Watson Pasha&#146; (Sir Charles Moore Watson, 1919). With his gift for condensing his sources in a simple and attractive style, several of these became standard works and were frequently reprinted. He was a versatile writer, able to produce both academic reference works such as the coin catalogues and <span class="italic">The Mohammedan Dynasties</span> (1894), and popular versions of his biographies and introductions to historical subjects, notably four contributions to the <span class="roman">Story of the Nations</span> series (<span class="italic">The Moors in Spain</span>, 1887; <span class="italic">Turkey</span>, 1888; <span class="italic">The Barbary Corsairs</span>, 1890; <span class="italic">Medieval India</span>, 1903).<br>
<br>His wife died in 1905, and Lane-Poole lived in retirement at 10 Brompton Square, London, until his death there on 29 December 1931. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 1 January 1932.<br>
