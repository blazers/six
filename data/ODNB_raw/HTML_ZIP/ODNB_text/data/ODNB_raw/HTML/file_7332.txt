<span class="headword">Dawes,  Manasseh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">barrister and writer on political and legal subjects</span>, was admitted to the Inner Temple on 30 May 1776, when he was described as &#145;of Chapel Street in the Parish of St George Hanover Square, gent&#146;  (admission register, Inner Temple). He was called to the bar rather later, on 13 May 1789. The Inner Temple proposed him for the readership of Lyon's Inn on 3 June 1791, but it is not known whether he was selected for the post nor whether he carried out the duties, which would have entailed delivering lectures on the common law in the Easter term. Indeed, little is known of his personal or professional life.<br>
<br>Dawes evidently did not practise long at the bar, for he was said by an obituarist in 1829 to have left it &#145;long since&#146; and to have lived &#145;in a very retired manner&#146; for the past thirty-six years in Clifford's Inn  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1829). The window tax return of 1796 shows him liable for five windows at 12 Clifford's Inn  (Inner Temple records, CLI/4/11). The obituarist went on to say:<blockquote>He was a gentleman of a very strong mind, and combined with a great knowledge of the law, much general information; and of this he left behind proofs, in several works, published at different periods of his life, of which some bear his name; others were anonymous.</blockquote>Writing in 1789 a reviewer drily commented of one of his articles: &#145;This long title explains the writer's design, and his execution displays equal pains and judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1789). The full title was &#145;A vindication of the proceedings of the Lords and Commons on the regency; in which the right is explained according to the constitution as deduced from the times of the Saxons down to the present. With proofs that the protests are founded in error and that an address to any person to accept the regency would have defeated the end intended to be obtained, be an infringement on the rights of the people, an offence to majesty and an indignity in the Lords and Commons&#146;.<br>
<br>Dawes took the whig side in the war in the American colonies and in 1777 published <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Chatham on American Affairs</span> in which he claimed to be author of &#145;several anonymous pieces&#146;. He also sided with the whigs on the law of libels, publishing in 1785 two articles commenting on the Shipley case: &#145;England's alarm, or, The prevailing doctrine of libels and deformity of the doctrine of libels&#146;. His <span class="italic">Essay on Intellectual Liberty and Tolerance</span> (1780) criticized Jeremy Bentham's <span class="italic">A Fragment on Government</span>, and he defended the legal writer Sir William Blackstone against Bentham. He also intervened (1780) in the polemic between Joseph Priestley and Richard Price. His <span class="italic">Essay on Crimes and Punishment</span> (1782) was a wide-ranging commentary on writings by Beccaria, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Fielding, and Blackstone, while <span class="italic">The Nature and Extent of Supreme Power</span> commented on John Locke's social compact theory. In 1814 came <span class="italic">Introduction to a Knowledge of the Law on Real Estates</span>, followed in 1818 by <span class="italic">Epitome of Landed Property</span>.<br>
<br>Dawes also wrote poetry, notably: &#145;An Elegy by a Son on the Loss of his Mother; with a Discourse on Selfishness in Sorrow&#146;. A contrasting title was &#145;The Dying Prostitute&#146;. In 1784 he edited John Stuckey's &#145;Vanity of All Human Knowledge&#146; which, with typical thoroughness, was &#145;now corrected, enlarged and arranged with an account of the life of the author&#146;. He died on 2 April 1829 at his home in Clifford's Inn. It appears that he was unmarried: in his will he mentioned a sister, Ann Evans, and two nieces, but no closer relatives. He directed that his library be sold, but left his papers to his &#145;esteemed acquaintance&#146;, the writer Vicesimus Knox. It was his desire to be buried in the Grosvenor chapel, Hyde Park  (PROB 11/1754/212).<br>
