<span class="headword">Pryme,  Abraham</span>  (1671&#150;1704), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 15 January 1671 in the parish of Hatfield, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest child of Mathias Pryme (1645&#150;1694), yeoman, and Sara (1649&#150;1729), daughter of Peter Smagge or Smaque, a Parisian Huguenot. Born in a house on the broad levels that had been drained by Dutch engineers in the early part of the century, Abraham Pryme descended from a family that had come over from Ypres to take part in the enterprise. He was baptized in the Dutch congregation at Sandtoft in Lincolnshire on 15 or 22 January. In 1680 the family moved a short distance to Crowtrees Hall, a large house built by one of the Valkenburgh brothers who had been prominent in the drainage scheme.<br>
<br>Despite the dissenting inclinations of the Dutch settlers and his own family, Pryme received schooling from William Eratt, the Church of England incumbent at Hatfield and a friend of his father. In childhood he began to keep, albeit inconsistently, a diary in which he recorded contemporary political chatter and his own antiquarian activities. In adult life this became a more regular activity, supplemented by letters received and sent, with other free-standing insertions, but there are large gaps in the early years and parts of it were clearly written up later. Published by the Surtees Society in 1870, it constitutes an interesting record of his studies, with much entertaining anecdotal detail, although it is not greatly informative about his major projects.<br>
<br>His father hoped he would go to Glasgow University but on 2 May 1690 Pryme was admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, becoming Cardinal Morton scholar on 7 November following. In addition to his prescribed work he pursued, in his first year, private botanical studies, and in February 1692 his diary discloses a practical interest in magic. In this Pryme was not, apparently, alone; esoteric pursuits may have contributed, at any rate, to the suicide of his friend Humphrey Bohun later that year, which affected him deeply. He none the less continued the study of magic until, the following January, he received a severely worded letter from Bohun's father dissuading him. Thereafter he reverted to botany and natural sciences, which remained an interest all his life.<br>
<br>Pryme graduated BA in January 1694. In July his father died, leaving most of his property to Abraham's younger brother Peter, though Abraham received &pound;100 and certain occupied copyhold tenements near Epworth in Lincolnshire. He was ordained deacon in September 1694, and the following June was appointed curate of Broughton near Brigg, in Lincolnshire, due east across the Trent from his native area. Situated near the northern terminus of Ermine Street, this region is rich in Roman remains, particularly coin hoards and the traces of rural settlements. Chance finds of this sort&#151;such as the mosaic floor of a villa at Roxby&#151;and the documentary and architectural remains of the area's medieval past focused Pryme's antiquarianism. Apart from a rather weak history of the nearby parish of Winterton, dated 1703 (and published in 1866), he produced several papers on the antiquities and natural phenomena of the area that later appeared in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Pryme resigned his curacy in November 1697 and returned to Hatfield, &#145;the better to carry on my history of that place&#146;, as he says in his diary. The resulting &#145;Historia universalis oppidi et parochiae Hatfieldensis&#146;, a substantial work in thematic sections, survives in Lansdowne MS 897 in the British Library. Section 7 (&#145;Belgicus&#146;) is doubtless the history of the Dutch drainage of Hatfield Chase referred to in a letter of March 1703 as begun more than six years earlier. Probably in connection with the section entitled &#145;Ecclesiasticus&#146;, he discovered that some of his land had belonged to a religious house before the dissolution. Genuinely distressed, he made it over to the parish of Hatfield.<br>
<br>In September 1698 Pryme was ordained priest and appointed curate and reader at Holy Trinity Church, Kingston upon Hull, at the invitation of the rector. It was to Hull's history that he now turned his attention, compiling a detailed analytical index of the records of the city corporation and applying the method already used for Hatfield to produce the &#145;History, antiquities and description of the town and county of Kingston upon Hull&#146;. This work, surviving in various manuscript copies both in Hull and in the British Library, is thorough and intelligently done, displaying a close and laborious application to the documentary evidence. It is still of great value for those writing on Hull. Again, he made an unwelcome discovery, namely that his appointment as curate was irregular, leave not having been given by the corporation. The mayor and aldermen, themselves previously unaware of the technical requirement, were happy to confirm him in the position.<br>
<br>In his years at Hull, Pryme built up a wide correspondence with other antiquaries including Nathaniel Johnston, Thomas Gale, Ralph Thoresby, and Hans Sloane. On 18 March 1702, proposed by Sloane, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He also used his contacts to collect manuscripts, coins, and other antiquities, which placed his income under severe strain and required him to seek a benefice. On 1 September 1701 he was presented to the living of Thorne, near Hatfield, by the duke of Devonshire. Visiting the sick in his parish, however, he caught a fever and died, unmarried, on 12 or 13 June 1704; he was buried near his father in Hatfield church on 14 June. On 18 October his brother Peter was admitted heir to his copyhold lands in the manorial court of Epworth. From Peter descended the family who later regularly called themselves de la Pryme, a form which was in retrospect firmly attributed to the antiquary, but was only rarely used by him. His collections were dispersed, many manuscripts passing to the herald John Warburton, thence being subsumed in the Lansdowne collections now in the British Library.<br>
