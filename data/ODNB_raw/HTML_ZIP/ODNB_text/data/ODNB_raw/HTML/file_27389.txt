<span class="headword">Thring,  Edward</span>  (1821&#150;1887), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, born at Alford, near Castle Cary, Somerset, on 29 November 1821, was the third son and fifth child of John Gale Dalton Thring (1784&#150;1874) and his wife, Sarah (1790&#150;1891), daughter of John Jenkyns, vicar of Evercreech, near Alford. His father was squire and rector of Alford; his mother was sister to Richard Jenkyns (1782&#150;1854), master of Balliol College, Oxford. Edward's four brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36517/', "Henry Thring")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36516/', "Godfrey Thring")</script>.<br>
<br>Thring attended a private classical school, Ilminster grammar, before going on to the Eton College of Dr Keate and Dr Hawtrey, where he eventually became captain of the collegers. His early experience in Long Chamber, the collegers' dormitory, and his previous harsh experience at Ilminster influenced his later thinking on educational reform. As captain of Eton collegers he was one of the last to benefit from the ancient custom of Montem, a day given over by the school for the pecuniary benefit of the college captain before he departed for university. Thring went to Cambridge in 1841 as a scholar of King's College, winning the Porson prize for Greek iambics in 1844 and graduating BA in 1845 and MA in 1848. He was a fellow of King's from 1844 to 1853.<br>
<br>In 1846 Thring was ordained and appointed to the curacy of St James's parish in Gloucester, the city where Robert Raikes developed the Sunday school movement in the 1780s. During a year's teaching in a national school in Gloucester, Thring encountered an educational problem and also devised a solution: the use of different teaching techniques in the education of less able or culturally deprived children. Throughout his pedagogic career Thring was convinced that a school needed the most skilful teachers for the less able or elementary classes, a principle he tried to apply later at Uppingham. He was in Gloucester for only a year, having suffered a breakdown in health. He became a private tutor in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, for two years and then spent the following two years as curate at Cookham Dean, Berkshire, during which time he was an examiner at Rugby and Eton and for the classical tripos at Cambridge. He had already developed a strong belief in the analytical teaching of English grammar as the best foundation for language teaching, publishing <span class="italic">The Elements of Grammar Taught in English</span> (1851; 3rd edn, 1860) and <span class="italic">The Child's Grammar</span> (1852). On 10 September 1853, at the age of thirty-one, Thring was elected headmaster of Uppingham School, which was to be his life's work. Shortly afterwards, on Christmas day 1853, he married Marie Louise (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of Carl Johann Koch of Bonn, commissioner of customs for the Prussian government. He had been sent abroad by his father to stop the marriage of his younger brother to Marie Koch and, a dutiful son, achieved this by marrying her himself. Subsequently Thring's methods showed the mild influence of German educational theories.<br>
<br>During thirty-four years as head Thring refounded this small midland grammar school, founded originally by Archdeacon Robert Johnson in 1584, and turned it into a leading mid-Victorian public school. Thring always claimed that when he arrived at the school there were only twenty-five boys; within ten years he had raised the numbers to over 300. He could have recruited even more boys but preferred, much to the chagrin of his housemasters, to keep the school relatively small: one of his guiding principles for the conduct of Uppingham was that a headmaster should know all his boys. A major event in Thring's career at Uppingham was &#145;the flight to Borth&#146; in 1875/6 when the school was temporarily closed because of typhoid fever arising from the town's poor drainage. In this hour of crisis Thring showed great leadership and arranged for the school to stay largely in a hotel and a few other houses at Borth, on the Welsh coast, near Aberystwyth. He saw the year's exile as a rejuvenating process, restoring some of the school's original ideals. Moreover the school's return to Uppingham in 1876 caused him to be regarded as a returning hero by the townsfolk, with whom Thring did much to foster good relations.<br>
<br>As well as knowing all his pupils, Thring applied at least five other principles in his conduct of Uppingham School. His egalitarian nature led him to acknowledge secondly that &#145;every boy was good for something&#146; and it was the task of the teacher to discover what that &#145;something&#146; was. In order to do this a wide curriculum and a range of extra-curricular subjects were required. He expanded the Uppingham curriculum to enable boys not only to engage in academic subjects other than the classics, such as English composition, French, German, and chemistry, but also to experience subjects which were normally considered outside the average school curriculum: drawing, woodwork, art, and music. He was particularly concerned that music be well established in the school under the master of music, Paul David. About a third of the boys learnt to play a musical instrument and several well-known Victorian musicians, including Sir William Sterndale Bennett, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, and Herr Joseph Joachim, visited the school. The &#145;Almighty Wall&#146; was a third principle of Thring. Like Vittorino da Feltre, the Renaissance educator, Thring believed in the educative value of fine surroundings to encourage learning. During his headship he converted his modest provincial grammar school into a fine architectural example of a handsome English public school. &#145;Machinery, machinery, machinery&#146; was a fourth principle in which he took pride. He felt that Uppingham, which he sometimes likened to a ship, was so well organized that, if needs be, it could run well without his presence.<br>
<br>&#145;Manliness&#146;, a common enough Victorian value, was fully taken on board by Thring. As an ordained clergyman and a good games (cricket and fives) player, Thring was himself an outstanding example of a muscular Christian. As such he was totally dedicated to the concept of manliness and was supportive of the games ethic within the school. But an even more overarching notion governed his thinking: a fifth, visionary, principle of &#145;True Life&#146;. The phrase &#145;True Life&#146; was constantly on his lips and was the principle to which he appealed daily in the governance of his school. Manliness (<i>thymos</i>) was part of this principle of True Life, but only a part. Thring's True Life was similar to the old Greek aristocratic notion of <i>aret&#275;</i> or virtue, a notion shared by the Greeks, Romans, and men of the Renaissance. For Thring, education was training for True Life. It was because his ultimate loyalty lay with True Life, which held connotations of the Platonic concept of balance and harmony, that in his later years at Uppingham he began to take a restrictive view of organized games and athleticism, believing their undue prominence gave an imbalance to school life. In short, they militated against his master principle, which in the long term made the boys responsible for their own behaviour.<br>
<br>During his headship of Uppingham, Thring pioneered a number of educational innovations: the school was, in 1859, the first public school to possess a gymnasium. In 1869 it was the first public school also to set up an educational mission in the East End of London (north Woolwich). Further, Thring is the acknowledged founder, in 1869, of the powerful Headmasters' Conference in collaboration with his close colleagues John Mitchinson of King's School, Canterbury, and H. D. Harper of Sherborne School. Among his fellow public school headmasters Thring stood out as a champion of girls' secondary education and invited the leaders of the girls' public school movement in 1887 to hold their annual conference at Uppingham.<br>
<br>Thring's influence was greatest in the wider pedagogical world, where his writings on education were highly regarded. His <span class="italic">Theory and Practice of Teaching</span> (1883) was a popular textbook in training colleges in Britain and was read widely in America. Between 1883 and 1912 it was reprinted sixteen times, being the vade-mecum of many a training college student. Thring regarded teachers as his co-workers or &#145;skilled workmen&#146; in a very important field of human endeavour, and they were attracted by his suspicion of bureaucratic control of education. He differentiated, as many have done before him and since, between teaching and &#145;pumping&#146; or cramming. Thring's <span class="italic">Theory and Practice of Teaching</span> is written in his very idiosyncratic style, with colourful imagery, pithy aphorisms, and egalitarian earnestness, especially where he expounds his &#145;Legs not wings&#146; theory. Thring wrote several other books in the context of education, including <span class="italic">Education and School</span> (1864), a much less successful book than <span class="italic">Theory and Practice</span>, though significant since it contains a major exposition of Thring's concept of True Life, which could be equated with moral education.<br>
<br>Thring died at Uppingham on 22 October 1887 and was buried in the nearby churchyard under a large Celtic cross which lies beyond the school walls. His wife, three daughters, and a son survived him. Sometimes compared with Thomas Arnold in his educational achievement, Thring was the greatest public school headmaster during the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
