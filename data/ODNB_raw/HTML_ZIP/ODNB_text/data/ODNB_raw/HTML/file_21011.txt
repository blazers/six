<span class="headword">Owen,  Jacob</span>  (1778&#150;1870), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 28 July 1778 in Llanfihangel, Montgomeryshire, the son of Jacob Owen, civil engineer, and his wife, Margaret Ellis. After being educated at a school in Monmouth, he was apprenticed to William Underhill of Tipton, Staffordshire, a canal engineer, whose daughter Mary (1781&#150;1858) he married in 1798. They had seventeen children, thirteen of whom survived childhood. He joined the Royal Engineers' department of the Board of Ordnance in 1805 and was promoted to full clerk of works in the following year. Most of his career in the Ordnance was spent in Portsmouth. In 1831 his commanding officer there, Colonel John Fox Burgoyne, was appointed chairman of the newly established commissioners of public works in Ireland. Owen joined him in Dublin in June 1832 as engineer and architect to the new board of works (as it was commonly known), a post which he was to hold until his retirement in 1856, at the age of seventy-seven. In Portsmouth he was assisted in his official duties by his brother John (<i>d</i>. 1867) and in private practice by his son Thomas Ellis Owen (1804&#150;1862), who had trained as an architect in London. Thomas became a member of Portsmouth corporation in 1831 and served as mayor in 1847&#150;8 and again in 1862; he was instrumental in the development of Southsea as a watering-place, designing terraces and villas as well as a church, St Jude's (1850&#150;51). He also designed the French protestant church of St Martin's-le-Grand, London (1842&#150;3; dem. 1888).<br>
<br>Some of Jacob's other sons remained in England, including Jeremiah (1802&#150;1850), who became a metallurgist to the Admiralty and store receiver at Woolwich Dockyard, and Joseph Butterworth (1809&#150;1872), who was the rector of St Jude's, Chelsea. Other sons joined their father in the board of works, where critics perceived a dynasty in the making: William Henshaw Owen (<i>b</i>. 1813) was the board's engineer in Limerick; Henry (<i>b</i>. 1815) was his father's pupil and assistant before becoming in 1841 surveyor for Queen's county; while James Higgins Owen (<i>b</i>. 1822), who was made a clerk of works in 1849, succeeded his father as architect to the board in 1856. One of Jacob Owen's pupils, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16059/', "Charles Lanyon")</script>, who received a county surveyorship in 1835, married his daughter Elizabeth Helen in 1837. The board's senior clerk of works, Frederick Villiers Clarendon, married Owen's granddaughter Margaret Jane Slacke in 1853.<br>
<br>Most of Owen's public commissions were in Dublin, where he erected extensions and new buildings at the Four Courts (1833&#150;40), added wings to the vice-regal lodge (1842&#150;54), and extended the record buildings at the King's Inns (1848&#150;9). His earliest work at Dublin Castle was a block of castellated stables (1833); he subsequently remodelled the state apartments and other buildings there. He was also concerned with monitoring the construction of the new government prisons on the separate system, including Belfast (designed by Charles Lanyon, 1842&#150;6) and Mountjoy (offered to Owen, but designed by Joshua Jebb, 1847&#150;50). In the late 1840s Owen oversaw a number of major projects for which consultant architects had been appointed, including the three Queen's Colleges (at Belfast, Galway, and Cork), seven new district lunatic asylums, and extensions to Maynooth College (by A. W. N. Pugin). Almost all were neo-Gothic, as was his own criminal lunatic asylum at Dundrum, near Dublin (1847&#150;50). Although eclectic, Owen's penchant was for the Greek revival style.<br>
<br>Owen also carried out private commissions, including work for other departments such as the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the board of national education (for whom he adapted Tyrone House in Dublin and designed the adjacent training college and model schools, 1834&#150;42). In 1839 he won an architectural competition for a parish church (St Patrick's) at Dalkey, co. Dublin (built 1840&#150;43). After some years of prevarication, the Treasury compelled him to relinquish his private practice (in return for an increase in allowances) in 1846. His retirement from the public service ten years later coincided with an impending expansion of the architectural activities of the board of works, with countrywide building programmes for the police, coastguard, Post Office, and education department. These were to be overseen by his son James, who died in office in 1891. James was aided from 1863 by his assistant architect Enoch Trevor Owen (1832/3&#150;1881)&#151;possibly a son of Jeremiah&#151;who joined the board of works as a drawing clerk in 1860.<br>
<br>Owen was short (about 5 feet 3 inches), burly, and balding, with a florid complexion. His brusque manner, family favouritism, and dominance of Irish public works architecture brought him enemies. While there were several allegations of impropriety, none was proven, though it was conceded privately by one commissioner, Thomas Aiskew Larcom, that conflicts of interest had arisen in his examination of his own pupils as candidates for county surveyorships. He was an investor in his son's developments in Southsea, where he moved from Dublin in 1867 with his second wife, Elizabeth Donnet Fry, widow of Captain John Fry. In 1864 he was a founder, with his son James, of the Irish Civil Service Building Society. He was an early fellow and vice-president (1849&#150;67) of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.<br>
<br>Owen died at Tipton, Staffordshire, on 29 October 1870, and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. His second wife predeceased him by five months.<br>
