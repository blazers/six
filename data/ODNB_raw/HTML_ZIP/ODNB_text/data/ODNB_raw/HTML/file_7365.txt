<span class="headword">Day,  George Edward</span>  (1815&#150;1872), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 4 August 1815 at Tenby, Pembrokeshire. He was the son of George Day of Manorabon House, Swansea, who had inherited the fortunes of his father, George Day, physician to the nabob of Arcot, and his uncle Sir John Day, solicitor-general in Bengal. G. E. Day's mother was Mary Hale, a descendant of Sir Matthew Hale, and after his father's ruin by the failure of a bank in 1826 he was brought up by his grandmother, Mrs Hale. Day may have been apprenticed to a general practitioner in Worcestershire before he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1833. After one term he obtained a scholarship at Pembroke College, where he graduated as twenty-ninth wrangler in 1837. He studied medicine in Edinburgh, where he won medals in anatomy, midwifery, and physiological botany. He was awarded the Harveian prize medal for 1843. He took his MA degree at Cambridge in 1840 and was granted a licence to practise by the university in 1842. In 1843 he began practice in 3 Southwick Street, London, becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1844 and a fellow in 1848. He became FRS in 1850. He was physician to the Western General Dispensary and lecturer on materia medica at the Middlesex Hospital.<br>
<br>Day supplemented his income through reviewing and translating, and was co-editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Journal of Medical Science</span> (1845&#150;55), <span class="italic">Monthly Retrospect of Medical Sciences</span> (1849), and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Sciences</span> (1848&#150;52). He was also a contributor to many other periodicals. His translations included <span class="italic">Animal Chemistry</span> (2 vols., 1845&#150;6), from the German of J. F. Simon; <span class="italic">The Pathological Anatomy of the Human Body</span> (1847), from the German of J. Vogel; and <span class="italic">The Pathological Anatomy of the Organs of Respiration and Circulation</span> (1852), from the German of C. Rokitansky. In 1849 he became Chandos professor of anatomy and medicine at St Andrews, and quickly obtained the necessary MD degree from Giessen. He was a popular professor, and carried out reforms in the MD examination. Day's own publications include <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on the Domestic Management and most Important Diseases of Advanced Life</span> (1849), an early English language textbook on geriatric medicine, an American edition of which also appeared in 1849, and his <span class="italic">Chemistry and its Relation to Physiology and Medicine</span> (1860). In 1841 he married Ellen Anna, daughter of James Buckton, solicitor, of Doctors' Commons and of Wrexham. They had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Day broke his right arm after falling down a mine shaft on Helvellyn in 1857, as a result of which the arm became virtually useless except for writing &#145;which he did by lifting the injured arm with his left hand on to a cushion placed on the desk and moving it only from the wrist&#146;  (Scott, 833). He soon developed a sinovitis of the right knee which confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Day retired in 1863 and settled at Torquay in the forlorn hope that it would improve his health. He died at Andersey, Torquay, on 31 January 1872. The council of the St Andrews Medical Graduates Association later organized an appeal in an attempt to provide for his widow.<br>
