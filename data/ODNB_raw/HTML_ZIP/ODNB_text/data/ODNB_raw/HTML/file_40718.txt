<span class="headword">Bushe, Sir  (Henry) Grattan</span>  (1886&#150;1961), <span class="occ">lawyer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Trinidad on 1 January 1886, the son of John Scott Bushe, colonial secretary of Trinidad and acting governor at the time. An ancestor was Charles Kendal Bushe (1767&#150;1843), solicitor-general for Ireland (1805) and chief justice of the king's bench and queen's bench in Ireland (1822&#150;43). Henry Grattan Bushe was educated at Aysgarth School and Denstone College.<br>
<br>Called to the bar in 1909, Bushe was a member of the south-eastern and western circuits in 1910&#150;16 and of the Hertfordshire and Essex sessions in 1916, and a member of Marshall Hall's chambers. He then began a public service career as secretary to the royal commission investigating the contracts between the War Office and Sir John Jackson Ltd (1916&#150;17). On 14 April 1914 he married Mary Kenrick Gibbons Chambers. They had one son (killed in action in 1944). In 1917 he joined the Dominions and Colonial Office as acting legal assistant; he subsequently became assistant legal adviser (1919&#150;31) and legal adviser (1931&#150;41).<br>
<br>A junior colleague, William Dale (who eventually became legal adviser to what became the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), later described Bushe in his memoirs. He was:<blockquote>a small spare man with flat grey hair, glinting brown eyes, and an impish look &hellip; Brooding over the legal scene sat Bushe, in his large room overlooking Downing Street. He was of Irish extraction, a penetrating lawyer, outspoken; he hit hard at humbug, and could be sarcastic, not to say cynical. (Dale, 57)</blockquote>Bushe was deeply committed to the rule of law and sound administration in the colonies. He introduced the professional magistracy to take over the magistrates' courts from the district officers in east and west Africa. In the 1930s he was much involved in the problem of Palestine, where Britain had assumed the mandate from the League of Nations after the First World War. Bushe had little sympathy for the concept of a national home for the Jews as outlined in the Balfour declaration, and little or no patience with the very serious tensions between Arabs and Jews. In the abdication crisis in 1936 he was principally concerned to ascertain the views of the colonies, to advise, and to preserve the constitutional monarchy.<br>
<br>In 1941 Bushe was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Barbados. This transfer to a governorship was a promotion without precedent in the colonial service, for governors had rarely been chosen from the ranks of practising lawyers and never before from the legal staff of the colonial office. It was neither an easy post nor an easy period. Bushe was sent to administer a community which, while itself highly critical, took unkindly to criticism from others and was very conscious of the fact that its House of Assembly was, next to the House of Commons and the Bermuda House of Assembly, the oldest legislature in the British empire. But it could hardly be expected that a constitution devised for an infant white settlement in the reign of Charles I would be flexible enough to meet conditions in the twentieth century with a large ethnic population&#151;of rapidly growing political consciousness&#151;living side by side with the descendants of the original white settlers. Indeed, the rigidity of the constitution and other defects had long given rise to friction between governors and elected members.<br>
<br>As a trained constitutional lawyer, Bushe was quick to see where the constitution could be improved, and was able before the end of his term of office to prepare the way for improvements. He had also to contend with all the security measures necessitated by the war and with the difficult questions of conserving and distributing food stocks seriously restricted by the enemy submarine blockade. The ethnic element, sharing the general West Indian political desires, wanted a wider franchise; labour demanded wider recognition; and the planters were unsure of the future for their sugar. All these insistent problems Bushe handled shrewdly, skilfully, and with success; and his administration proved to have been a significant stage in the history of the colony. He retired in 1946, returning to Britain.<br>
<br>Bushe was appointed CMG in 1927 and CB in 1932, and was advanced to KCMG in 1936. He was also a knight of grace of the order of St John. His club was the Union Club. Lady Bushe, a trained musician and keenly interested, as a dame of the order of St John of Jerusalem, in the work of the St John Ambulance Brigade and of the Girl Guides, actively supported her husband in everything that made for the encouragement in the colony of music, drama, and cultural activities. Sir Grattan Bushe died at Guy's Hospital, London Bridge, London, on 23 August 1961. His wife survived him.<br>
