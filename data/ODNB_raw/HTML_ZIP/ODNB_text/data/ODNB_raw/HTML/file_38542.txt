<span class="headword">Bauer,  Ferdinand Lukas</span>  (1760&#150;1826), <span class="occ">botanical artist</span>, was born on 20 January 1760 at Feldsberg, Austria, the son of Lukas Bauer or Baur (1706/7&#150;1762), court painter to the prince of Liechtenstein, and his wife, Theresia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hirsch. Three sons&#151;Joseph (1756&#150;1831), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38540/', "Franz Andreas Bauer (1758&#150;1840)")</script>, and Ferdinand&#151;showed a talent for drawing and in their formative years were influenced by Prior Norbert Boccius (1729&#150;1806). About 1780 Franz and Ferdinand moved to Vienna and there met Baron Nickolaus von Jacquin (1727&#150;1817). Because of Ferdinand's talent, Jacquin set him to help prepare his <span class="italic">Icones plantarum rariorum</span> (1781&#150;93). Through Jacquin he met John Sibthorp and was subsequently taken on as illustrator for his <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span> (1806&#150;40). In 1786 Bauer accompanied Sibthorp to Italy, the Aegean, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. Late that year he returned to England with Sibthorp to continue illustrating the <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span>. In London in the 1790s he also illustrated papers for the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span> and through this his work became known to Sir Joseph Banks, who was then looking for a botanical artist to go on a voyage of exploration to Australia. Bauer was recruited for HMS <i>Investigator</i>, commanded by Lieutenant Matthew Flinders RN. His salary for the voyage was paid by the Admiralty, he was under the orders of the naturalist to the expedition, Robert Brown, and he shared the artwork with William Westall.<br>
<br>
<i>Investigator</i> sailed from Spithead in July 1801 and after calling at Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope crossed the Southern Ocean to Western Australia. The vessel then sailed eastwards, touching various points and making natural history collections, along the southern coast and passing through Bass Strait to anchor at Port Jackson. More plants were collected in the neighbourhood of Sydney while <i>Investigator</i> was refitted, and in late July 1802 she sailed up the Queensland coast, passing into the Gulf of Carpentaria in early November. In this remote place, with the hurricane season approaching, she was found to be unseaworthy; the survey was terminated shortly after and <i>Investigator</i> sailed to Timor and thence back to Sydney where the vessel was declared irreparable and in June 1804 downgraded to the status of a hulk.<br>
<br>Bauer remained in Australia collecting and drawing plants while (abortive) attempts were made to obtain a new survey ship. He resided in the settlement of Sydney but made a short trip during March and April 1804 to the Hunter River where he drew plants and collected herbarium specimens. He also sailed for Norfolk Island on <i>Albion</i> on 21 August 1804, returning to Sydney on 11 March 1805 for the sea trial of the hastily refitted <i>Investigator</i>. Bauer and Brown finally left Sydney on 23 May 1805 in the still-leaking <i>Investigator</i> and arrived at Liverpool on 13 October.<br>
<br>Bauer prepared well over 2000 plant and animal field drawings during the voyage of <i>Investigator</i>. He remained in London from 1806 to 1814, during which time he completed some 234 watercolours from his original field sketches. The work was paid for by the Admiralty and most drawings passed to it. The British Museum acquired the Admiralty drawings in 1843. At his death Ferdinand Bauer's original pencil sketches of landscapes from Norfolk Island and some of his botanical drawings were bought by his brother Franz, who was by this time a plant illustrator at Kew. When Franz died in 1840 they were auctioned at Christies and bought by Robert Brown, now keeper of botany in the British Museum, and given to the museum. James Britten, writing in 1909, confirmed that the museum received botanical drawings from the Admiralty and others from Brown. Consequently Ferdinand Bauer's completed watercolours of Australian plants and animals and Norfolk Island field sketches are to be found today in the botany and zoology libraries of the Natural History Museum, London.<br>
<br>Fifteen of his plates (seventeen drawings) appeared in Bauer's only publication, <span class="italic">Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae</span> (1813&#150;16), for which he engraved the copper plates himself. This work was originally conceived as illustrating Robert Brown's <i>Prodromus</i> of 1810 but, because of cost, and the labour involved, this intention was not realized. A further ten illustrations prepared from Bauer's originals were engraved by other artists as uncoloured plates and published in the atlas accompanying Flinders's narrative of the <i>Investigator</i> voyage (1814) and published along with William Westall's Australian coastal profiles. However, the post-Napoleonic war period was a time of depression and <span class="italic">Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae</span> was not a commercial success. Consequently, with Europe now relatively peaceful, in 1814 he returned to Vienna, taking his original Australian field drawings with him. Bauer visited England only once more, in 1819, and died at Hietzing, Vienna, on 17 March 1826. At the subsequent auction, held in March 1827, many of these drawings were bought by Emperor Franz I. The majority of the surviving original field sketches, both coloured and pencil drawings, are now in the Nat&uuml;rhistorisches Museum, Vienna; many of them are dated, located, and colour-coded. They also include both plants and animals seen at <i>Investigator</i> landing places&#151;that is from Madeira, South Africa, the various Australian collecting sites, Norfolk Island, and Timor&#151;and numerous orchids from New South Wales. The copper plates made for <span class="italic">Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae</span> survive in London and an edition was printed from them in 1989.<br>
<br>Some authorities feel that Bauer was the most accomplished botanical artist ever but he is little known because so few of his drawings were published. His watercolours are superb and the animal drawings in particular have a most lifelike quality. Accounts were published of these beautiful drawings from the 1960s onwards, but it was not until the 1990s that catalogues of the Bauer animal and plant watercolours in the Natural History Museum were prepared. The Bauer brothers are commemorated in the Australian plant genus <i>Bauera</i> (Cunnoniaceae).<br>
