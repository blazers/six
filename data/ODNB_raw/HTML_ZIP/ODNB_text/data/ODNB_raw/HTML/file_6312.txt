<span class="headword">Corey,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1699&#150;1735), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was, according to the <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span>, &#145;descended from an ancient family in Cornwall, but was himself born at Barnstaple, in Devonshire&#146;  (Baker, 148). It has been suggested that he may alternatively be the son of the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67758/', "Katherine Corey, n&#233;e Mitchell")</script>, and her husband, John Corey, baptized at St Clement Danes on 26 April 1668  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> records that he abandoned the study of law at the New Inn for a career on the stage. It is possible that this change of direction coincided with, or was precipitated by, the production of his first play, <span class="italic">A Cure for Jealousy</span>, at Lincoln's Inn Fields during the 1699&#150;1700 season. This slight comedy, set in and around Covent Garden, was eclipsed by the success of George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, but it was published in 1701, the year in which Corey made his first recorded appearance as an actor, in the undemanding role of Faithless in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">The Gentleman Cully</span>. His name continued to appear on playbills until the close of the 1734&#150;5 season at Drury Lane, invariably in secondary roles. He was, however, sufficiently esteemed by Thomas Betterton to be granted a solo benefit on 4 July 1704. It was also in 1704 at Lincoln's Inn Fields that his second and last play, <span class="italic">The Metamorphosis</span>, was performed. This unremarkable farce was derived from the sub-plot of <span class="italic">Albumazar</span>, a comedy presented to James I at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1614. Its provenance suggests that Corey was, for an actor, uncommonly well read, and may have been of service to his successive theatrical managers by proposing additions to the repertory. Without some such supplementary source of income, his modest status as an actor would barely have sustained him.<br>
<br>Corey's traceable career is representative of that of a jobbing player in the early years of the eighteenth century. Beginning with the joint company under Betterton, he moved with the patent holders to the Queen's Theatre from 1705 to 1708, then to Drury Lane from 1708 to 1714, but advanced only to the Player King in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and Malcolm in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Most summers until 1727 found him working on the booth stages of London's fairs. Perhaps in the hope of better roles, he shifted allegiance from Drury Lane to John Rich's Lincoln's Inn Fields from 1714 to 1719, and was rewarded with Laertes, in which he made little impact. He returned to Drury Lane, and, with the exception of a season at Goodman's Fields in 1732&#150;3, remained there until his last recorded appearance, as the Lord Chamberlain in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, on 8 May 1735. He was, says the <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span>, &#145;a just and sensible speaker, yet being but low in stature, and his voice none of the best, he was ever obliged to work against the stream, and labour with difficulties&#146;. No details of his private life seem to have survived, and it is eloquent of Corey's unobtrusiveness that Colley Cibber, who acted with him often and became his manager, makes no reference to him in his <span class="italic">Apology</span>. It may also say something of his quality that, when Theophilus Cibber engineered a walkout of actors from Drury Lane in May 1733, Corey did not join the exodus.<br>
