<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paulet,  John</span>, fifth marquess of Winchester  (1598?&#150;1675), <span class="occ">royalist nobleman</span>, was the third but eldest surviving son of William, the fourth marquess (<i>d</i>. 1629), and Lucy Cecil (1568&#150;1614), second daughter of Sir Thomas Cecil, afterwards second Baron Burghley and first earl of Exeter.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Paulet was probably born at the family seat of Basing House, Hampshire, and nothing is known of his early life except that he was educated at home and then kept terms, without matriculating, at Exeter College, Oxford. He enters national history with his election to the 1621 parliament for the Cornish borough of St Ives, under his courtesy title of Lord St John. He obviously pleased James I, for he was called to the Lords on 10 February 1624, in his father's barony of St John. Charles I also favoured him, appointing him to the captainship of the royal fort of Netley Castle in 1626 and to the keepership of the royal forest of Pamber when he succeeded to the marquessate on his father's death on 4 February 1629. These offices were both in Hampshire, and reinforced his position as one of the county's wealthiest landowners; but his Catholicism, coupled with the burden of debt inherited from his father, barred him from further employment.<br>
<br>Winchester passed the 1630s quietly at his seat, devoting his time to rebuilding the family fortunes. He had married his first wife, Jane Savage, in December 1622; she was the daughter of another Catholic nobleman, Thomas, first Viscount Savage, and her beauty and goodness won tributes from Milton and from James Howell, who had taught her Spanish. She died of a throat infection in April 1631, having given him his eldest son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21613/', "Charles Paulet")</script>. In October 1633 he remarried into a grander Catholic house, by wedding Lady Honora De Burgh (<i>b</i>. 19 Aug 1610), daughter of Richard, first earl of Clanricarde and of St Albans. They had four sons, two of whom&#151;John and Francis&#151;survived to adulthood, three daughters, and the pleasures of a mutually affectionate and supportive partnership.<h2>
<a name="ThesiegeofBasingHouse"></a>The siege of Basing House</h2>The blessings of strong family support were to be needed as the English civil war broke out, finding the Winchesters still living in seclusion at Basing. They took no apparent part in the opening stages of the crisis, and their loyalties only became active in the summer of 1643, a year after the outbreak of hostilities. In March complaints had reached parliament that royalist soldiers had been given shelter and refreshment at Basing House, and in late July the marquess heard that a parliamentarian force was planning to visit, disarm, and plunder it. He attended the king and asked to have soldiers from the royal army sent to protect the mansion. Charles selected the recently raised foot regiment of the Yorkshireman Marmaduke Rawdon, and dispatched a hundred musketeers of it from Oxford, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Peake, with an escort of horse. These arrived in the nick of time on 31 July, as the parliamentarians, led by the local activist Richard Norton, had reached the house and were being resisted by the marquess with just his servants and six gentlemen armed with muskets. The enemy withdrew, and Basing was now fortified with 14&frac12; acres of earthworks, strong enough to resist all but a massive battery. Rawdon became the governor with Peake as his lieutenant.<br>
<br>This transformed Winchester's seat into the principal royalist fortress of northern Hampshire, covering the roads between London and the west country and thus of vital strategic importance. It was accordingly attacked as soon as parliament could bring a regional army to bear upon it, that of Sir William Waller, which assaulted it repeatedly between 6 and 13 November 1643. The garrison now numbered about four hundred; the marchioness and her ladies cast fresh shot for them out of lead stripped from the mansion, and the defences held out. By April 1644 the motto &#145;Love loyalty&#146; was engraved on every window pane. It was tested in that month when Winchester's younger brother was discovered to be plotting to betray the house; he was turned out of it after being forced to hang his accomplices. The coming of summer made a sustained siege viable, and Norton opened one with the local parliamentarian forces on 11 June. It relied upon starvation, reinforced by desultory bombardment, but was broken by a relief force from Oxford on 11 September. Norton renewed it, only giving up when a detachment of the royal army approached on 20 November. The Winchesters had survived unharmed although a cannon-ball had once passed through the marquess's chamber while he lay in bed.<br>
<br>The garrison was now at peace, and in May 1645, at Winchester's insistence, was turned into a wholly Catholic body. Rawdon was removed to other commands, and Peake took over a force reduced to three hundred. On 23 August it was again besieged by local forces, this time under a Dutch professional, Colonel Dalbier. He slowly weakened the defences with bombardment until 8 October, when Oliver Cromwell arrived with an exceptionally powerful train of siege guns and reinforcements which brought the besieging army to about seven thousand. The odds were now too great; Cromwell's guns blew several breaches in the outworks and walls, which were stormed before dawn on 14 October. Religious rancour gave the action a brutality unusual in this war, and between one and two hundred of the defenders were slaughtered. Winchester himself was taken unhurt, together with his most distinguished guests: Peake, the artist Wenceslaus Hollar, and the architect Inigo Jones. They were, however, stripped of their clothes by the soldiers, and the house was accidentally set on fire after it had been looted bare. The victors estimated the total value of the plunder at &pound;200,000.<h2>
<a name="DefeatandRestoration"></a>Defeat and Restoration</h2>On 15 October 1645 the House of Commons resolved that the ruins of Basing House should be demolished, and on 20 October the Lords concurred with a further resolution that the marquess of Winchester be committed to the Tower of London and his lands confiscated. The marchioness had been at the royal court at Oxford since early 1644, and was allowed to go to London to assist him, at his request, in January 1646. On 15 January the Commons allowed him a pittance from his estates, as he had now no means of income at all and was nearing starvation. On 31 January some of his lands were granted to Cromwell; &pound;15 per week was allowed from the residue to support the marchioness and the children, on condition that the latter were educated as protestants. The sale of the rest of the estate was ordered on 25 September, although the process was still not complete by 1660.<br>
<br>The marquess of Winchester apparently remained in the Tower until 7 September 1647, when he had become so ill that both houses allowed him to settle at Epsom and take the waters there. He was taken back into custody in the following spring, with the approach of the second civil war, and the Lords urged the Commons to allow him bail upon 30 June 1648, as he was again in serious bad health. The request seems to have been rejected, and in the propositions sent by both houses to the captive king on 13 October, Winchester was one of the royalists excepted from pardon. On 14 March 1649 the newly established republican House of Commons considered trying him for his life in the wake of the execution of the king and other royalist peers, and magnanimously decided to leave him in prison. This sustained animosity on the part of the MPs, especially marked in view of his utter lack of activism since 1645, may be ascribed primarily to his religion.<br>
<br>He was eventually released at some point in the early 1650s and retired to an estate at Englefield, Berkshire, which had been part of his wife's marriage portion. While in captivity he had commenced the translation of French works, mostly devotional, to which he added pious introductions: Jacques Hugues Quarre's <span class="italic">Devout Entertainment of a Christian Soul</span> (1648), Pierre Le Moyne's <span class="italic">Gallery of Heroic Women</span> (1652), and Nicholas Talon's <span class="italic">The Holy History</span> (1653). He continued to be vexed by financial troubles following the loss of most of his fortune, and in January 1656 petitioned Cromwell for relief after being imprisoned for non-payment of debts totalling &pound;2000.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Winchester was restored to his estates but not compensated for his losses, although the Convention Parliament discussed an award of &pound;19,000 on 3 August 1660 and the Cavalier Parliament resolved upon, but never implemented, one of &pound;10,000 on 2 July 1661. This was also the year in which he was recalled to his place in the House of Lords, but on 10 March 1662 he suffered a further loss of a different kind in the death of his wife, Honora. She was buried in the church at Englefield, and a striking example of personal continuities during the period, despite political and religious divisions, is that Milton provided the epitaph for her tomb, saluting her virtues, just as he had written one for the first marchioness.<br>
<br>Winchester married for the third time before April 1669; his new wife was Isabella Theresa Lucy Howard (<i>b</i>. 1644), daughter of another Catholic dignitary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13948/', "William Howard, first Viscount Stafford")</script>. The union was childless, and she outlived him to die on 2 September 1691. Winchester took no further part in national affairs, save in attendance of the House of Lords, and returned to the quiet provincial life which had been interrupted by civil war. He made no attempt to rebuild Basing, but continued to live at Englefield House and to beautify and enlarge it as a new seat. His main interests were in agricultural improvement and in literature. The greatest vexation of his later years was probably his estrangement from Charles, his son and heir, who became opposed to him both in politics and religion, and was to make his own dramatic career in both. In 1663 a quarrel between them over the disposition of the family estates had already become so intransigent that it was only settled by an act of the Cavalier Parliament. The marquess died at Englefield, of unknown causes, on 5 March 1675, and was buried near his wife in the church. Another first-rank poet provided his tomb epitaph, John Dryden, who extolled the two obvious aspects of his career: loyalty and suffering.<br>
<br>Winchester's portraits show a neat and handsome man with gentle and rather melancholy eyes. In his fidelity to his monarchy and his church&#151;at times, as in the dismissal of Rawdon, verging upon fanaticism&#151;he reflected a nature which was always both serious and pious. His career, however, was in the main that of a man inclined to private and provincial life, whose enthusiasms were for letters, learning, and the improvement of his property. It was his tragedy that the centre of that retired existence, his country seat, should itself have been the cause of his propulsion to the forefront of national affairs, in especially traumatic, and disastrous, circumstances.<br>
