<span class="headword">Bewick family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1775&#150;<em>c.</em>1875), <span class="occ">engravers</span>, came from Northumberland. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2334/', "Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828)")</script> and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2332/', "John Bewick (bap. 1760, d. 1795)")</script>, wood engravers, were the first and fifth of nine children born to John Bewick (<i>bap</i>. 1715, <i>d</i>. 1785), farmer and collier, and his second wife, Jane Wilson (1727&#150;1785), at Cherryburn, Eltringham, Northumberland. John Bewick died unmarried, at Ovingham, Northumberland, after a promising career in the London engraving trade had been cut short by consumption. Thomas Bewick, whose principal business in Newcastle upon Tyne was as a general engraver on metal and copperplate printer, at the same time became celebrated as the father of modern wood engraving, his reputation being widely established by the publication of his two natural histories: <span class="italic">A General History of Quadrupeds</span> (1790) and <span class="italic">A History of British Birds</span> (2 vols., 1797 and 1804) [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69665/', "Bewick, Thomas, apprentices")</script>]. Thomas Bewick and his wife, Isabella Elliot (1752&#150;1826), had four children, all of whom died unmarried. The eldest, <a name="cosubject_2331"></a><span class="headword">Jane Bewick</span>  (1787&#150;1881)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 29 April 1787 at Newcastle upon Tyne. She became very active in supporting her father in his business activities, dealing particularly with publishers and booksellers during the last ten years of his life. In 1825 John F. M. Dovaston described her as:<blockquote>mistress of her father's house, which she conducts &hellip; without bustle or disturbance. She also corrects the press for his works, and looks after the getting of them up; writes his letters of business; keeping his house and shops in order. Her great delight is in his fame. (Dovaston)</blockquote>She supervised the production and publication of the two posthumous editions of <span class="italic">British Birds</span> in 1832 and 1847, and in an uneasy collaboration with her cousin, the Newcastle printer Robert Ward, edited and published her father's autobiographical <span class="italic">Memoir</span> in 1862. At about this time she made valuable notes on her father's acquaintances and on the narrative content of many of his vignette tailpieces. Her forthright and lively character is fully displayed in her letters home when travelling to London, Edinburgh, and Buxton. Together with her sister, <a name="cosubject_42034"></a><span class="headword">Isabella Bewick</span>  (1790&#150;1883)<span class="occ"></span>, who was also born at Newcastle upon Tyne, on 14 January 1790, she was a jealous guardian of their father's posthumous reputation, carefully preserving his correspondence, original drawings, proofs, and the complete series of original woodblocks for his three principal works. They planned the gift of large collections of drawings and prints to the British Museum and to the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle upon Tyne (now Natural History Society of Northumbria). Deeply suspicious of would-be biographers of their father and metropolitan collectors such as T. F. Dibdin and the Revd Thomas Hugo, they were nevertheless susceptible to the flattery of a few others, Ruskin among them, and their surviving correspondence and the records of their release of small groups of prints and drawings provide a useful view of the nineteenth-century enthusiasm for their father's work. Jane died on 7 April 1881, to be followed by her sister Isabella on 8 June 1883&#151;both at their home, 19 West Street, Gateshead, co. Durham. They were buried at St Mary's, Ovingham, Northumberland, on 12 April 1881 and 11 June 1883 respectively.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_2333"></a><span class="headword">Robert Elliot Bewick</span>  (1788&#150;1849), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, Thomas Bewick's only son, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne on 26 August 1788. Always a diffident character and prone to ill health, he was brought up in the business, apprenticed between 1804 and 1810, and in 1812 made partner in T. Bewick &amp; Son, engravers and copperplate printers, but he failed to realize his father's ambitions for him. He was a meticulous draughtsman, a skilful practical engraver more at home on copper than on wood, but he had none of his father's inventive genius, nor any head for promoting a vigorous trade for himself in later years. His work on copper is to be seen in bill-heads, book-plates, and book illustration; as a wood engraver he contributed to his father's <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span> (1818) and produced a small group of blocks for the unpublished <span class="italic">History of Fishes</span> which first appeared in his father's <span class="italic">Memoir</span>. He made a quantity of highly finished drawings of fish which are now in the British Museum and several of which were shown in the first exhibition of the Northumberland Institution for the Fine Arts in 1822. Despite his father's despairing letter to Jane&#151;&#145;what can my Robert mean by poring constantly &amp; stupifying himself with Perspective&#151;he ought never to have the pencil out of his hand&#146;  (28 June 1814, Natural History Society of Northumbria)&#151;he pursued his interest, and many of his perspective drawings of buildings and domestic interiors survive. His few wood engravings occasionally show the initials R. E. B., his copper engravings the full signature R. E. Bewick, and his drawings if not signed can sometimes be identified by his own captions. In her old age Jane Bewick frequently put a signature to the unsigned drawings in her care, not always accurately.<br>
<br>A touching account of Robert Elliot Bewick and his &#145;two tall old fashioned maiden sisters&#146; is given in William Bell Scott's <span class="italic">Autobiographical Notes</span>:<blockquote>a heavy, slouching, able bodied countryman, as I thought, about fifty-five or so, with an absent, bewildered expression of face, the snow lying white on his penthouse eyebrows &hellip; to this man I felt drawn in a singular degree, mainly by the almost reverent simplicity and diffidence of his manner, which evidently prevented him adequately expressing himself. (Scott, 2.194&#150;6)</blockquote>The account continues with a description of Robert's skilful playing of the delicate, sweet-sounding Northumberland smallpipes. Encouraged by his father, who kept a record of the costs of his lessons, music, and instruments, he was playing at an early age, and was taught by John Peacock, one of the last of the old Newcastle pipers. It is his legacy of five manuscript collections of the melodies of the time which now keeps Robert Bewick's memory alive and which has played an important part in the renewal of interest in the traditional music of north-east England. He died on 27 July 1849 at the family home, 19 West Street, Gateshead, co. Durham, as did his sisters. The burial place of the family is in the graveyard of St Mary's, Ovingham, Northumberland.<br>
<br>Watercolours, drawings, and prints by Thomas, John, and Robert Elliot Bewick were given to the department of prints and drawings at the British Museum in 1882 (1882-3-11-1243-5558), and in 1884 to the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle upon Tyne (Hancock Museum, University of Newcastle upon Tyne).<br>
