<span class="headword">Sewell,  William</span>  (1781/2&#150;1853), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon</span>, was born of Quaker parents, possibly William and Elizabeth Sewell, resident in Essex. He was possibly baptized on 10 February 1782. He was apprenticed at about sixteen years of age to Edward Coleman (1764?&#150;1839), the second professor of the London Veterinary College, and at Coleman's request Sewell was appointed his assistant at the college on obtaining his diploma in 1799. According to the college minute books, Sewell was appointed assistant surgeon on 6 March 1799, but it is recorded in the register of pupils held by the college that he did not pass his examination until 30 March 1799. This contradicts J. B. Simonds, who states that it was not until after Sewell had passed his examination, on 30 March, that Professor Coleman applied to the college governors to appoint Sewell as his assistant surgeon. In 1803 Sewell became assistant professor at the college.<br>
<br>Sewell first came into prominence in connection with his supposed discovery in 1803 of a canal pervading the medulla spinalis, which he demonstrated in the horse, ox, sheep, hog, and dog. His opinions on this point were erroneous, but he has been credited with being on the brink of the great discoveries made many years subsequently by Sir Charles Bell. In July 1805 Sewell was appointed veterinary surgeon to the London and Westminster light horse volunteers; he maintained this role until 1850. In 1815 he made a tour of France, visiting the veterinary establishments at Lyons and Paris; in 1816 he made a similar tour of inspection through Germany by way of Vienna, Prague, Berlin, and Hanover. A report of this tour was submitted to the governors of the London Veterinary College in 1818; however, it was described by William Hunting, at a later date, as reading like an auctioneer's catalogue and containing not one single observation of value.<br>
<br>Also in 1818 an extremely important discovery, or rather rediscovery, that of neurotomy, was published in a paper presented by Sewell to the governors of the London Veterinary College. In 1823 a fuller and more detailed account was published in the <span class="italic">Elementary Lectures on the Veterinary Art</span> by William Percivall, who attributed to Sewell the chief credit for the discovery. However, in an article in the <span class="italic">Veterinary Record</span> for 31 March 1894, the author indicates that William Moorcroft had anticipated a cure for lameness in horses some years before Sewell presented his paper. Sewell also practised a new method of treating splints, considering the use of the firing iron as barbarous and cruel. In addition he claimed to have discovered a cure for glanders, in the use of sulphate of copper; this was looked upon with considerable distrust by his colleagues. He similarly incurred the displeasure of certain of his fellow veterinarians for having reported to the Royal College of Physicians rather than to the veterinary profession his finding of a case of vesicular calculus in the horse; details of an operation for lithotomy; and illustrations of glanders. Sir Frederick Smith records that Sewell was a &#145;very reserved man, unsociable, of few words, hesitating, unpopular with the students and unpopular with the profession&#146;. Criticism of Sewell's teaching abilities is discussed at length in articles in <span class="italic">The Farrier and Naturalist</span> in 1828&#150;9.<br>
<br>In 1828 the London Veterinary Medical Society was formed, and shortly after its formation Sewell became president, a post he occupied for several years. In 1836 there was some dissension among the members of the society and it was disbanded. It was later reformed as the Veterinary Medical Society. Edward Coleman became its patron, and Sewell its president. On the death of Coleman in 1839, Sewell was appointed to succeed him as principal of the Royal Veterinary College and he delivered his inaugural lecture on 18 November. Considerable disapproval was, however, shown at his decision to lecture on cattle pathology, a subject in which he was not considered to be sufficiently qualified, his speciality being rather that of surgery (however in 1842 J. B. Simonds was appointed to lecture on the diseases of cattle, sheep, and pigs). In 1840, during the prevalence of an epidemic of what was later named foot-and-mouth disease, the Royal Agricultural Society of England issued a circular to its members detailing full particulars as to the treatment of the disease according to the method recommended by Sewell. He was subsequently attacked by his colleagues, who claimed that his circular had spoilt their practice. In 1841 Sewell reported to the Royal Agricultural Society on the epidemic.<br>
<br>Coleman's death placed Sewell in many respects at the head of his profession, and his position received further recognition in 1852 by his election as third president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, which had received its royal charter in 1844. Sewell wrote two essays for the Veterinary Medical Association and presented two case histories to the Royal College of Physicians, and he made a few contributions to the veterinary and medical periodicals of the time. He also completed a report of his visit to the principal veterinary schools on the continent. Both his skill as an operator and his efficiency as a lecturer have been disputed, but he appears nevertheless to have achieved, eventually, a considerable success in both, and under his direction the Royal Veterinary College began to expand and improve its teaching facilities. Sewell was also instrumental in the fight for the royal charter for the profession and by 1852 had bridged the gap between veterinary education and veterinary practice.<br>
<br>Sewell married late in life; his wife, Mary <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkinson (1783/4&#150;1841), died not long after his appointment as principal of the Royal Veterinary College. Towards the end of his life, owing to his advanced age and occasional illness, Sewell confined his attention to the administration of the college, the actual duties of lecturing falling chiefly on younger men such as William Spooner and J. B. Simonds. Sewell died in London at the college on 8 June 1853 at the age of seventy-one, and was buried at Highgate cemetery. He left no family.<br>
