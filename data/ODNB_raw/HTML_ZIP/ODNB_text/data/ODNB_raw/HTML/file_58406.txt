<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benjamin,  Arthur Leslie</span>  (1893&#150;1960), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 18 September 1893 in Sydney, Australia, the son of Abram Benjamin and his wife, Amelia (whose maiden name may also have been Benjamin). His father worked on the stock exchange. Benjamin began his career as a pianist at the age of six. He studied at Bowen House preparatory school, Brisbane, then at Brisbane grammar school. During his teens he worked as a demonstrator at a Brisbane piano store; visiting Europe with his parents, he saw his first opera in Brussels.<br>
<br>In 1911 Benjamin went to the Royal College of Music, London, and studied composition with Charles Villiers Stanford, with whom he shared an admiration for Brahms; he studied fugue with Frederick Bridge. After gaining a scholarship in 1912 he stayed until 1915, when he joined the Royal Fusiliers, later transferring to the Royal Flying Corps.<br>
<br>After the war Benjamin returned to Sydney, where he taught the piano at the New South Wales State Conservatorium. Back in London in 1921, he composed, taught, and adjudicated, winning in 1924 the Carnegie award for composition with his first published work, a string quartet. In 1926 he became a piano professor at the Royal College of Music; his pupils included Benjamin Britten, William Blezard, Ivan Clayton, Irene Kohler, and Joan and Valerie Trimble. As an adjudicator for the Associated Board he visited Latin America and the Caribbean, where he was influenced by local dance rhythms. His <span class="italic">Jamaican Rumba</span> (1938) has had a popular worldwide reputation ever since: on the strength of it he received a yearly barrel of rum from the Jamaican people.<br>
<br>Benjamin wrote film music from the 1920s onwards, for example &#145;Waltz&#146; and &#145;Hyde Park Gallop&#146; for <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> (1947). In Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1955) he is seen rehearsing his own cantata at the Royal Albert Hall, and later listening in the audience at the performance. He also wrote for a documentary on the ascent of Everest (1953). As a concert pianist he performed his own concertino in 1926, conducted by Henry Wood. He gave the premi&egrave;re of Constant Lambert's piano concerto in 1931, with Lambert conducting.<br>
<br>The first of Benjamin's five operas, <span class="italic">The Devil Take Her</span>, was performed at the Royal College of Music in December 1931, and again in 1933&#150;4 with the Vic Wells company under Sir Thomas Beecham. His second, <span class="italic">Prima Donna</span> (1933), was produced at the Fortune Theatre in 1949 and revived at the Royal College of Music in 1968. In 1940 Benjamin became conductor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation orchestra, with which he stayed for five years. While in Vancouver he composed his first symphony. At the same time he was a resident lecturer at Reed College, Portland, Oregon.<br>
<br>After returning to London, Benjamin resumed teaching at the Royal College of Music. On an Arts Council commission he wrote the longest and most serious of his operas, <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> (1950), which was broadcast three times on BBC radio's Third Programme in 1953. The New Opera Company gave the first stage production at Sadler's Wells in 1957; a year later it was broadcast on BBC television. Meanwhile his fourth opera, <span class="italic">Ma&ntilde;ana</span>&#151;the first opera commissioned for television by the BBC&#151;was screened on 1 February 1956. At his death Benjamin's final opera, <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span> (1957&#150;60), was finished in short score, with just a few pages orchestrated; this was completed by Alan Boustead, who conducted the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells in the 1964 premi&egrave;re.<br>
<br>A colourful and warm-hearted man, Benjamin liked to dress casually in an open-necked shirt worn loosely outside his shorts. He was a Savile Club member; his hobbies included cooking (assisted by his Jamaican manservant), theatre, bridge, and nude sunbathing, which he undertook in the seclusion of his Hampstead bungalow garden. He spent many winters in Jamaica, travelling both ways on a banana boat.<br>
<br>Benjamin admired above all Brahms&#151;his proudest possession was a signed photograph&#151;and Puccini, whose dramatic technique and orchestration he emulated. He stood at a large draughtsman's desk in the window of his living room to orchestrate. His professionalism he attributed to the example of his close friend Ralph Vaughan Williams. While insisting that he did not teach composition, he was glad to advise young composers, including Richard Stoker and Alun Hoddinott. He considered Benjamin Britten a genius, and his opera <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> a masterpiece, but he disliked Beethoven's &#145;Pastoral&#146; symphony&#151;&#145;Damned cuckoos!&#146; he exclaimed, according to one pupil.<br>
<br>In 1956 the Worshipful Company of Musicians awarded Benjamin the Cobbett medal for composition. His individual approach took in all styles, and like his antipodean successors Malcolm Williamson and Barrington Pheloung, he made no distinction between light and serious.<br>
<br>Latterly Benjamin developed a heart condition, but enjoyed the resulting daily glass of brandy &#145;on doctor's orders&#146;. He died at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 10 April 1960, eight days after the American premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> at the State College, San Francisco. He was cremated at Golders Green on 14 April; his ashes were scattered on the crocus lawn there.<br>
