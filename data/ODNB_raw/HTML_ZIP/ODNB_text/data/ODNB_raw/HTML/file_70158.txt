<span class="headword">Lieberman,  Aaron Samuel</span>  (1849?&#150;1880), <span class="occ">socialist activist</span>, was probably born in 1849 in Lunna in Grodno province, then part of the Russian empire, son of Eliezer Dov Lieberman, a scholar of the Jewish enlightenment (haskalah). The family moved to Bia&#322;ystok and thence to Suwa&#322;ki. Aaron Lieberman studied at the crown-controlled rabbinical seminary in Vilna, obtaining his teaching diploma in 1867. In 1870 he was also briefly enrolled as an external student at the Technological Institute of St Petersburg. He returned to Suwa&#322;ki where he was appointed as a teacher and as secretary of the Jewish community, and is known to have worked for an insurance company in Vilna and as a draughtsman, having shown some talent in drawing.<br>
<br>By 1872 Lieberman was active in the local revolutionary circle based on ex-students of the Vilna seminary. He had been initiated by Aaron Zundelevich, a future leader of the Narodniki (&#145;Popularists&#146;), the forerunners of the Russian Social Revolutionary Party which advocated a form of peasant socialism in contrast to Marx's proletarian socialism. He was forced to flee abroad in June 1875, first to Berlin and then to London, where he arrived in August of that year. He found employment as a typesetter on the underground international socialist journal <span class="italic">Vperyod</span> (&#145;Forward&#146;) (1872), then being published in London under the editorship of Pyotr Lavrov. Lieberman wrote under several English and Hebrew <i>noms de plume</i> including Arnold Lieberman and Arthur Freeman. From December 1875 he was sharing an address in north London with Lavrov and sub-editor V. N. Smirnov.<br>
<br>Through his old Vilna comrade Leib Weiner, Lieberman was introduced to the Jewish East End of London. Back in Russia, Lieberman had evinced attachment to the Hebrew language and interest in the specific plight of the Jewish working classes, in opposition to the assimilationism of mainstream Russian socialism. At Weiner's home, 40 Gun Street, Spitalfields, he founded the Hebrew Socialist Union in May 1876, claimed to be the first Jewish socialist organization in the world. The ten original members were all Russian political exiles working in the immigrant trades, especially tailoring, and the core membership never rose beyond forty. The union called a public meeting at the Zetland Hall, 51 Mansell Street, Goodman's Fields, on 26 August 1876, for which handbills were printed in Yiddish. Publication of a socialist appeal to Jewish workers in the native tongue of East European Jewry was itself unprecedented. At about the same time Lieberman published in <span class="italic">Vperyod</span> a &#145;Call to Jewish youth&#146;, the first socialist manifesto written in Hebrew. The London meeting was attended by several hundred, but broke up in disorder when Lieberman was accused of making anti-clerical statements against the chief rabbi and the synagogue establishment. Jewish immigrants in England may have shared Lieberman's views on the need to impose a ten-hour day in the sweated trades, but they were by and large traditionalist in matters of religion.<br>
<br>For their part, the leaders of Anglo-Jewry took steps to curb the Jewish socialists, by a mixture of economic pressure, the use of <i>agents provocateurs</i>, and rabbinical censure. The talents of the charismatic Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Dainov, the <i>maggid</i> (preacher) of Slutsk, were deployed to fulminate against the socialists while the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> denounced them as missionaries. Lieberman's early attempt to create a Jewish Tailors' Union in London collapsed when the treasurer absconded with the funds. Tempers flared and he left London for Berlin in December 1876.<br>
<br>In 1877 in Vienna, Lieberman founded <span class="italic">HaEmet</span> (&#145;The Truth&#146;), significant as the first socialist propaganda periodical published in Hebrew, although it lasted for only three issues. He was arrested and expelled by both the Austrian and German authorities in turn and spent a total of two years behind bars. He appeared as a defendant in the so-called &#145;trial of the Russian nihilists&#146; in Berlin in April 1879. He was finally deported to England and briefly returned to the East End, living at 21 Elder Street, Spitalfields. He worked with the young Morris Winchevsky (1856&#150;1932) to set up an abortive Jewish Workingmen's Benefit and Educational Society, but eventually emigrated to the United States. In true Russian revolutionary style, in November 1880 Lieberman shot himself in a cheap lodging house in Syracuse, New York, after a failed love affair with Winchevsky's sister-in-law. (He is reputed to have left a wife in Russia.) In 1934 he was reinterred next to Winchevsky in the Workers' Circle cemetery in New York.<br>
<br>Lieberman never resolved the contradiction between international socialism and Jewish particularism. His position was attacked by anti-Jewish Russian intellectuals on the one hand and by traditionalist Jewish opinion on the other, a dilemma that was to face many Jewish socialists, both bundists and Labour Zionists, who came after him.<br>
