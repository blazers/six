<span class="headword">Mac Cumhaigh <span class="st"> [Mac Cooey]</span>,  Art</span>  (<em>c.</em>1738&#150;1773), <span class="occ">Irish-language poet</span>, was probably born in the parish of Creggan (perhaps in the townland of Mounthill), co. Armagh; he also had links with nearby Kilcurly, co. Louth. His poetry displays a knowledge of the classics, but he spent his short life as a labourer, gardener, and herdsman, most of it in the employment of various priests and of a protestant minister, the Revd Hugh Hill.<br>
<br>One of the best-known episodes in Mac Cumhaigh's life was his dispute with the parish priest of Creggan, the Revd Terence Quinn, whom he attacked&#151;as did his fellow poet Peadar &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n&#151;for being overbearing, partial towards the well-to-do, and imposing heavy financial exactions on his parishioners. He also satirized the priest's sister and housekeeper in a celebrated poem as &#145;M&aacute;re Chaoch&#146; (&#145;Blind&#151;or squint-eyed&#151;Mary&#146;). But, contrary to local tradition, the poem was not the sole&#151;nor perhaps even the primary&#151;cause of the poet's rift with the parish priest. That was more likely to have resulted from his abducting and marrying a second cousin M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Luain (Mary Lamb), in the protestant church, about 1770, an action that incurred his double excommunication. Ostracized by his neighbours, Mac Cumhaigh fled to Howth, co. Dublin, where he worked as a gardener. During his sojourn there, he composed his celebrated &#145;aisling&#146; (&#145;Ag cuan Bhinn &Eacute;adain ar bhruach na h&Eacute;ireann&#146;) in which he bemoaned his exile from his beloved Creggan. Within a year the excommunication was lifted and the poet returned to Creggan by permission, not of Father Quinn, but of the vicar-general of the archdiocese of Armagh. He then composed &#145;C&uacute;ilfhionn N&iacute; Choinne&#146; in reparation to the offended housekeeper; the work has been described by Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich as &#145;a fulsome tribute which is metrically perfect and patently insincere&#146;  (&Oacute; Fiaich, <span class="italic">Mac Cooey</span>, 14). He spent the remaining few years of his life working as a herd on a local farm.<br>
<br>In all, some two dozen of Mac Cumhaigh's compositions survive. His poems in praise of the local Gaelic lords, the O'Neills of the Fews&#151;now in Spanish exile following the Williamite victory in the &#145;War of the Two Kings&#146;&#151;include two on the ruined O'Neill stronghold of Glasdrummond Castle and an elegy of 262 lines on the death of Art &Oacute;g &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, heir of the O'Neills of Creggan, who died in 1769 aged twenty-six (and for whom the poet had earlier composed a praise poem). A second elegy composed in that same year was a lament for his fellow poet Peadar &Oacute; Doirn&iacute;n. Following his return from &#145;exile&#146; in Howth Mac Cumhaigh composed two savage satires entitled &#145;Bodaigh na hEorna&#146; (&#145;The Churls of the Barley&#146;) on the O'Callaghans of Cullaville, a well-to-do local Catholic family whose reputed snobbery, materialism, and philistine disregard for literature and music incurred the poet's wrath. Several of his poems relate to ecclesiastical matters, including a dialogue between the Catholic church at Faughart and the protestant church at Forkill, a succinct explanation of protestant doctrine addressed to a priest friend, and praise poems for two priests, the Franciscan Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hAnluain and Dominick Bellew, future bishop of Killala. There are poems in praise of a local tory or raparee, of a young woman, of a doctor who had healed an ulcer on the poet's leg, and on a member of the Catholic gentry. As well as some satirical or humorous pieces, there are a couple of vision poems known as <i>aisling&iacute;</i>, one of which, &#145;&Uacute;rchill an Chreag&aacute;in&#146;, has been described as &#145;one of the most interesting and sweetest aisling-poems in the Irish language&#146;  (&Oacute; Fiaich, <span class="italic">Art Mac Cumhaigh</span>, 170, original statement in Irish). It is noteworthy that these <i>aisling&iacute;</i> by Mac Cumhaigh lack the strong Jacobite sentiments of their Munster counterparts.<br>
<br>Art Mac Cumhaigh was known locally as &#145;Art na gCeolta&#146; (Art of the songs). Indeed most of his compositions were meant to be sung and the airs of many of the more popular items have been recorded.<br>
<br>Mac Cumhaigh's untimely death, which occurred a short distance north of Crossmaglen probably on 5 January 1773, was almost certainly brought about by over-indulgence in alcohol. He was buried in Creggan churchyard in an unmarked grave. The bicentennial of his death was marked by the unveiling of a fine monument at the spot where he is traditionally said to be buried. A collection of his poetry first appeared in print in 1916 and the bicentennial of his death saw the publication of a comprehensive edition of his work, including a detailed analysis of Mac Cumhaigh's life and times and the historical context of his poetry, and an appraisal of his surviving work, by Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Fiaich.<br>
