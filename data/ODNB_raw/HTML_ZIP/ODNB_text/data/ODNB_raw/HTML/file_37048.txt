<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wylie, Sir  Francis James</span>  (1865&#150;1952), <span class="occ">university administrator</span>, was born in Bromley, Kent, on 18 October 1865, the second son of Richard Northcote Wylie, businessman, and his wife, Charlotte Greenlaw. The Wylies had had a long connection with Russia. Wylie's father was a member of the bourse in St Petersburg, and his great-uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30134/', "Sir James Wylie")</script>, had been physician at the court of the tsar. Wylie himself spent short periods in Russia during childhood, but had no special association with that country in later life.<br>
<br>Wylie was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford. At the suggestion of his uncle by marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32239/', "Edward Caird")</script> (who was then professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow and was later to become master of Balliol), the promising young man went from school to pursue his classical studies at the University of Glasgow, from where he won a Snell exhibition to Balliol. He went up to Oxford in 1884 and soon showed himself a classical scholar of mark. He took a first class in honour moderations in 1886 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1888. He was not, however, the &#145;mere bookworm&#146; whom Cecil Rhodes deprecated; though of slight build he rowed in the Balliol eight and was elected to Vincent's Club and Leander. Throughout his long life he retained an alert and critical interest in rowing.<br>
<br>After taking his degree Wylie spent a few months teaching at his old school and then engaged in private tutoring until, after being made a lecturer of the college in 1891, he was elected a fellow of Brasenose in 1892. There he proved himself a successful and assiduous tutor and when he died there still survived a few of his former pupils who remembered with gratitude his lectures on Aristotle's logic. He was junior proctor in 1903&#150;4, a year which was to prove a turning point in his lifework. He cultivated a brisk diversity of interests, not the least of them in military service. It was characteristic of his dominant sense of duty that he was a zealous member of the Oxford University Volunteers. As a company commander in that corps he took part in the official obsequies of Queen Victoria. When, in the later chapter of his life, war broke out in 1914, he was too old for service in the field, but he threw himself with energy into the work of the Oxford University training corps and made a spirited contribution to its courses of instruction.<br>
<br>The will of Cecil Rhodes was made public in April 1902, and the trustees appointed by it were soon busy making plans for the inauguration of the scholarships. One of the trustees was Lord Rosebery, whom Wylie had come to know as private tutor to his two sons. George Parkin had been appointed organizing secretary to the Rhodes Trust, and in February 1903 Wylie was invited, through Rosebery, to supervise the Oxford side of the system and to assume a general tutelage of the scholars in residence. It was not an easy decision to make. He had an established position in a college to which he was much attached; he was well known in the academic sphere and was about to become a proctor; he was now invited to occupy an office with no academic standing, since the Rhodes trustees were a body outside the university organism, and to assist in launching a scheme which at that time was highly experimental. The project of the Rhodes scholarships was not universally welcomed in Oxford; the university and colleges were far more inbred in 1903 than they subsequently became, and there was considerable scepticism about an influx of colonials, Americans, and Germans, who, it was feared, might lower academic standards, especially in the classics, besides making undue demands on the limited room and resources of colleges. Wylie was under no illusions about the problems which would face him, and it was again a sense of duty which prompted him to accept the trustees' invitation. He had the opportunity, which he was amply to fulfil, of doing a notable service to imperial and Anglo-American relations, and he was never the man to shrink from responsibilities.<br>
<br>Wylie was soon to receive invaluable aid in his task. On 18 August 1904 he married Kathleen, daughter of Edmond Kelly, an American lawyer in Paris, where much of her girlhood was spent. Wylie had met his future wife when she was a member of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. For the next twenty-eight years this was to prove an ideal partnership for developing and influencing Cecil Rhodes's &#145;great idea&#146; in both its administrative and its personal aspects. Four sons and two daughters were born of the marriage, the eldest son dying in childhood. The fourth son, Shaun, was elected a fellow (mathematics) of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1939. One of the daughters, Vere, married an Australian Rhodes scholar, Lewis Charles Wilcher, who became in 1956 the first warden of Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford.<br>
<br>The story of the growing-pains and adventurous adolescence of the Rhodes scholarships has been told vividly by Wylie himself in his contribution  (pp. 59&#150;125) &#151;which he wrote almost at the end of his life&#151;to the volume <span class="italic">The First Fifty Years of the Rhodes Trust and the Rhodes Scholarships</span> published by the Rhodes trustees in 1955. To him, probably more than to any other individual, belongs the credit for having woven a fabric which was to become an integral part of the whole Oxford design. There were vicissitudes at first; but Wylie and his wife enjoyed the reward of seeing hundreds of young men from many far countries derive from Oxford what their benefactor had intended for them and acquit themselves with distinction in their later careers. There was none of them who did not acknowledge his debt to the Wylie influence and guidance.<br>
<br>Responsibilities constantly increased with the expansion of the Rhodes network by additional scholarships which the trustees established in British areas overseas, until the number of Rhodes scholars at Oxford at any one time grew to nearly two hundred, composed about equally of British and American nationals, with a small group of Germans. After twenty-eight years of arduous service, Wylie retired in 1931, but not before he had had the satisfaction of seeing the completion of a permanent memorial to the founder in Oxford, Rhodes House, of which he became the first warden. He was knighted in 1929, on the occasion of the reunion of Rhodes scholars at Oxford when Rhodes House was formally opened, and he was elected an honorary fellow of Brasenose in 1931.<br>
<br>Retirement, however, was by no means the end of Wylie's services to the Rhodes scholarships. For upwards of another twenty years he kept regular touch with his former charges. His world-wide correspondence with them was indefatigable and his personal memory and knowledge of them throughout the years were remarkable. Of the many Rhodes scholars who revisited Oxford from time to time few failed to make a pilgrimage to the Wylie home near Oxford, where perennial welcome awaited them, their kindred, and their friends. On Boars Hill, with a panorama of the Berkshire downlands spread before him, Wylie's tranquil life and temperament made light of the burden of years. He had always been a man of simple tastes, and he found continual refreshment in the Matthew Arnold country, which he knew intimately, in birds and flowers, in parish work, and in country walks which to the end of his life lost nothing of their zest and vigour. His faculties seemed to be quite unimpaired when, without warning, he died in his sleep at his home, Wootton Ridge, Boars Hill, on 29 October 1952.<br>
<br>With his wife Wylie made many journeys throughout the English-speaking world on embassies for the Rhodes trustees. Three colleges in the United States&#151;Union College, Schenectady (1932), Swarthmore College (1933), and Bowdoin College (1933)&#151;conferred honorary degrees upon him. In 1945 the Rhodes trustees permanently commemorated his name in Oxford by the foundation of a Wylie prize for an essay on some aspect of the relations between the American colonies or the United States and any part of the British empire or Commonwealth. Lady Wylie died in 1969.<br>
