<span class="headword">Beecroft <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Skirrow]</span>,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Betty]</span></span>  (1748&#150;1812), <span class="occ">iron manufacturer and butter seller</span>, was born Elizabeth Skirrow, and had at least one brother. She married George Beecroft (1739&#150;1820), a respected tenant farmer, and together they lived at Bramley in Yorkshire, close to Leeds, with Betty producing butter for sale at local markets. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>A woman of remarkable business enterprise and spiritual strength, Betty recorded in her diary how one evening in October 1778 she first discussed with her husband the possibility of leasing Kirkstall forge. On the banks of the River Aire, 4&frac12; miles to the west of Leeds, the forge had manufactured iron since the early thirteenth century. However, in 1778 the business and its attached farm, owned by the earl of Cardigan, were once again to let.<br>
<br>Betty relentlessly overcame her husband's reluctance to proceed. George Beecroft protested that &#145;It would take too much money!&#146;, but she replied, &#145;Never mind <i>that</i>. We shall do for that, I warrant thee&#146;  (Butler, 23). Nevertheless, after discussions with the earl of Cardigan's agent it became clear that the forge was in a ruinous condition and that new tenants would have to spend at least &pound;1000 on it. Despite her husband's &#145;Dither &amp; Shak&#146; and at least one attempt by him to withdraw from the venture, Betty persuaded George and his family to proceed. A passionate follower of John Wesley, she recalled that &#145;I began by talking about God's kind providence in so clearly opening our way in this matter and if we gave it up we should never have another chance again&#146;  (ibid., 24&#150;6).<br>
<br>A number of possible partners in the venture were considered&#151;and rejected&#151;by Betty Beecroft. The Dixon family were &#145;very sharp people and if they see a good pennyworth come their way may be they will not be generous enough with my husband, and may try to throw him out and take the whole to themselves&#146;  (Butler, 24). In the event Betty found better partners in two members of the Butler family, long established in the wool trade: John Butler (1738&#150;1826), who was also married to her husband's sister Jane; and Thomas Butler, a man of substance in Lichfield and sheriff there in 1770. The Butlers each invested &pound;500, and with some difficulty George and Betty managed to raise &pound;800.<br>
<br>&#145;And, now with much diligence, and I believe uprightness&#146;, Betty wrote, &#145;we proceeded on our way with our new business&#146;  (Butler, 27). The articles of agreement were signed, and the Beecrofts took possession of the dwelling house at the forge on 3 May 1779. While her husband looked after the farm, Betty was in sole charge of the forge. &#145;I undertook the care of the trade and the books: also the buying and selling and all the engagements of the men up to March 31st 1780&#146;  (ibid., 27). However, it became clear that John Butler, who came over once a week and paid the wages, was to be the key figure once he had wound up his other business; and from 1780 everything was &#145;generally ordered and decided&#146; by him  (ibid., 28).<br>
<br>Kirkstall forge was transformed by its new management. The existing water-wheels were replaced, and the old races leading to them from the abbey mill were enlarged. The screw mill was rebuilt, a plate mill was added, and in 1797 a puddling furnace was commissioned to exploit Henry Cort's new process. Iron was imported from the Netherlands, Russia, and Sweden; and from the mid-1790s, in addition to rods, bars, screws, and plates of iron, the forge was manufacturing more lucrative finished products. Initially these were spades, shovels, and patten rings, but in 1798 the first cart-arms were produced, and these and other axles later became the firm's speciality. Betty Beecroft's son George and John Butler's son Thomas both became partners at about this time, ensuring a future for &#145;Butlers and Beecrofts&#146;.<br>
<br>After 1785, when John Butler built himself a house at the forge, Betty's role steadily declined, but she continued to help in the counting-house until 1805. A curious advertisement that she placed in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> on 4 May 1793 indicates that Betty continued selling farm produce: this condemned the &#145;vile and malicious&#146; reports that she had exported butter and bacon to revolutionary France and offered a reward of 10 guineas for the discovery of the propagator of the rumour  (Butler, 22).<br>
<br>Local tradition records that John Wesley was attacked by a mob in the area, and took refuge in a chamber in Kirkstall forge. Whether Betty met Wesley then is not recorded, but she certainly did so in London shortly before he died in 1791. As she wrote to her mother, &#145;I hope I shall be ever thankful that he gave his blessing upon one so unworthy of his notice&#146;  (Butler, 29).<br>
<br>A much-loved figure in both the Butler and Beecroft families, Betty died in 1812. A tribute from a Wesleyan minister accurately noted that, though &#145;neither free from defects nor destitute of eccentricities&#146;, Betty was legendary for her &#145;industry, economy, integrity, firmness of mind and inviolable attachment to the Scriptures&#146;  (Butler, 110). Guided by a sure sense of providence, Betty Beecroft was also a remarkably astute businesswoman.<br>
