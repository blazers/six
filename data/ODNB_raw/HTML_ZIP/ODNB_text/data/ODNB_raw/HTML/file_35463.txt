<span class="headword">Pemberton,  Thomas Edgar</span>  (1849&#150;1905), <span class="occ">theatre historian and playwright</span>, born at Heath Green Cottage, Birmingham Heath, on 1 July 1849, was the eldest son of Thomas Pemberton, the head of an old-established firm of brass founders in Livery Street, Birmingham, and his wife, Lucy Johnston. The novelist Sir Max Pemberton was his younger brother. He was educated at the Edgbaston proprietary schools, and at the age of nineteen entered his father's counting-house. In due course he gained control of the business, with which he remained active until 1900. Of literary taste from his youth, Pemberton began his career in writing with two indifferent novels, <span class="italic">Charles Lysaght</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">Under Pressure</span> (1874), but showed more promise in <span class="italic">A Very Old Question</span> (3 vols., 1877). <span class="italic">Born to Blush Unseen</span> (1879) was praised, and was followed by an allegorical fairy tale, <span class="italic">Fairbrass</span>, written for his children. He married, on 11 March 1873, Mary Elizabeth, the second daughter of Edward Richard Patie Townley of Edgbaston; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In his youth at his father's house, Pemberton met E. A. Sothern, Madge Robertson (Mrs Kendal), and other actors on visits to Birmingham, and was inspired to write for the stage. His first comedietta, <span class="italic">Weeds</span>, was written for the Kendals, and produced at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, Birmingham, on 16 November 1874. Although his most popular farce, <span class="italic">Freezing-a-Mother-in-Law</span>, originally given at the Birmingham Theatre Royal, was later produced in New York by Sothern, most of his plays were rarely seen outside provincial theatres. He came to know the American author Bret Harte, and with his collaboration wrote the highly successful play <span class="italic">Sue</span>, produced in America in 1896 and at the Garrick in 1898. The partnership continued until Harte's death in 1902, upon which Pemberton wrote <span class="italic">Bret Harte: a Treatise and a Tribute</span>. Pemberton also dramatized novels, such as Thackeray's <span class="italic">The History of Henry Esmond</span> and Dickens's <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>, adapted as <span class="italic">Sidney Carton</span>.<br>
<br>Pemberton succeeded his friend Sam Timmins as the drama critic of the <span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</span> in 1882. He retired to the country, at Broadway, Worcestershire, in 1900. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Mail</span> a weekly column of dramatic gossip, entitled &#145;Flashes from the footlights&#146;. But he made his widest reputation as a theatrical biographer, and wrote memoirs of Sothern (1889), the Kendals (1891), T. W. Robertson (1892), John Hare (1895), Ellen Terry and her sisters (1902), and Sir Charles Wyndham (1905). He frequently lectured on theatrical subjects, and was an excellent amateur actor. In 1889 he was elected a governor of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon, and was for many years the honorary secretary of Our Shakespeare Club. He died after a long illness at his residence, Pye Corner, Broadway, on 28 September 1905, and was buried in the churchyard at Broadway.<br>
