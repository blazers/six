<span class="headword">Barford,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1792), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was the son of the Revd Thomas Barford (<i>d</i>. 1765), rector of Chalbury, Dorset, where he was baptized on 2 September 1719. He was educated at Eton College (1730&#150;38), and was a scholar at King's College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1743, MA in 1746, and DD in 1771. His first preferment was the vicarage of Milton, Cambridgeshire, in 1751. He became a tutor of the college, a proctor in 1761, and from 1762 to 1768 public orator, only resigning to stand for the Greek professorship, which he failed to obtain. Rector of Tilton, Northamptonshire, from 1764 to 1768, he became vicar of Fordingbridge, Hampshire, which is in the gift of King's College, in 1768. On 27 September 1764 he married Mary Hewer of Royston, Hertfordshire. In 1770 Sir John Cust, the speaker of the House of Commons, appointed him as his chaplain, but he served only one session before a new speaker, Sir Fletcher Norton, was elected and chose James King as his chaplain. Barford's friends were concerned that such a short tenure would not be rewarded by the customary preferment found for the chaplain. This incident established that the task was to be chaplain to the house, not merely to the speaker. &#145;The House is so much in possession of him that the Speaker cannot displace him without consulting the House&#146;  (Price, 31).<br>
<br>On 9 May 1770 it was moved an address be made to the king that Barford &#145;be favoured with the customary recompense for his service&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1793, 418). The fortuitous death that month of Francis Walwyn, a prebendary of Canterbury, provided a suitable vacancy to which he was installed in June. In 1773 he resigned Fordingbridge and accepted the rectory of Kimpton, Hertfordshire, and then in 1778 the dean and chapter of Canterbury living of All Hallows, Lombard Street, both of which he retained until his death. He became a fellow of Eton in 1784.<br>
<br>Barford's Latin dissertation on the first Pythian ode, first published in 1751, was included in Henry Huntingford's edition of the works of Pindar, which also contains a short biography and a bibliography of Barford's writings, including Latin and Greek verses and orations written while he was public orator. In his <span class="italic">New System of Mythology</span> Jacob Bryant pays tribute to Barford's talents and thanks him for his assistance. Barford died at Kimpton in November 1792, and was buried on 30 November in the church of Sts Peter and Paul, Kimpton.<br>
