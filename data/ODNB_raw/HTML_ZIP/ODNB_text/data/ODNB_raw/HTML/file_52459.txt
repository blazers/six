<span class="headword">Hull <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Malet]</span>,  Eleanor</span>, Lady Hull  (<em>c.</em>1394&#150;1460), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the only child of Sir John Malet of Enmore, Somerset (<i>d</i>. before 1395), retainer of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and of his wife, Joan (<i>c</i>.1370&#150;1426), daughter of Sir John Hylle of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1426), sister of Robert Hylle (compiler of the so-called Hylle cartulary) and subsequently the wife of, in turn, Simon Michell, John Luttrell, and William Cornu. Before 1413 Eleanor married Sir John Hull (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1420), retainer of John of Gaunt and ambassador to Castile for Henry IV and Henry V, and had a son, Edward (<i>c</i>.1410&#150;1453). Unlike her mother she did not remarry after her husband's death.<br>
<br>Like her father, husband, and son, Eleanor served the house of Lancaster. In 1417 she was granted 50 marks per annum as servant of Queen Joan, second wife of Henry IV; the grant was renewed in 1420 and 1423, and granted her jointly with her son in 1444 and 1451. In 1444 she and her son travelled to France for the proxy marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. She was indirectly connected with the foundation of Syon Abbey as she is said to have brought Thomas Fishbourne, later its first confessor-general, to the attention of its founder, Henry V. She was more closely associated with the abbey of St Albans, to whose confraternity she was admitted in February 1417 and to whom she and her family made frequent gifts. Most notably she and her spiritual and legal adviser Roger Huswyf presented the abbey with a copy of Nicholas de Lyre's <span class="italic">Postillae</span> (now CUL, MSS Dd.7.7&#150;10) in 1457. After her husband's death she was by 1427 living from time to time at Sopwell Priory, a Benedictine nunnery dependent on St Albans: she was temporarily absent when the priory was attacked by the robber William Wawe and his gang, <i>quaerentes</i> <i>Elienoram Hull</i> (&#145;seeking Eleanor Hull&#146;; <span class="italic">Annales &hellip; Amundesham</span>, 1.11). It was probably during this period that she made her translations. In 1436 she was listed with an annual income of &pound;86 in the national return under the county of Hertfordshire, where Sopwell and St Albans are situated. Her son, Sir Edward, was killed at the battle of Castillon in 1453; his will appointed her as his executor. By 1458 she had retired to the Benedictine priory at Cannington, Somerset, where in the will made &#145;with her own hand&#146;  (Maxwell-Lyte and Dawes, 352) she requested to be buried. She probably died in December 1460, since her will was proved on 2 January 1461.<br>
<br>Two translations from the French extant in CUL, MS Kk.1.6, a commentary on the penitential psalms, <span class="italic">The Seven Psalms</span>, and a collection of prayers and meditations, are attributed to Eleanor Hull by the manuscript's compiler, Richard Fox, <i>procurator</i>, or steward, of St Albans (<i>d</i>. 1454). She could read Latin as well as French (she bequeathed her breviary, psalter, and Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Huswyf), and both read and write English. No doubt as an heiress she was educated at home with more than usual care, possibly under the influence of her maternal uncle Robert Hylle. As the first woman translator from French into English whose name is known she is indicative of the level of culture that some fifteenth-century laywomen of the gentry class achieved. Although she was devout, learned, and alive to her secular responsibilities, the neglect of her by subsequent historians is equally significant.<br>
