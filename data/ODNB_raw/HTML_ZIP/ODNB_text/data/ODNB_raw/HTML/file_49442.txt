<span class="headword">Phillips,  John</span>  (1708/9&#150;1775), <span class="occ">carpenter and builder</span>, was one of at least two sons of Matthew Phillips of East Hagbourne, Berkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. His grandfather, another Matthew Phillips, was a builder, and his uncle, <a name="cosubject_56797"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Phillips</span>  (<em>c.</em>1689&#150;1736), son of Matthew Phillips senior and his wife, Joan, was a notable <span class="occ">master carpenter</span> in London.<br>
<br>Thomas Phillips had been apprenticed to Jeremiah Franklin of Oxford, a carpenter, in 1705, but pursued a career in London. He worked as a carpenter (with Benjamin Timbrell) on the churches of St Peter, Vere Street (1721&#150;4), and St Martin-in-the-Fields (1722&#150;6), built a wooden bridge from Fulham to Putney in 1727&#150;9 (replaced by a stone bridge in 1882&#150;6), and was employed by the office of works on several buildings including William Kent's Treasury. He also participated in most of the speculative developments that took place in west London after the Hanoverian succession in 1714, and in 1725 he was appointed to be one of the initial vestrymen chosen to manage the new parish of St George, Hanover Square, where he also assisted in the erection of several parish buildings including the workhouse. He built himself a house in the parish, at 39 Brook Street (later altered by the architect Sir Jeffry Wyatville for his own residence), where he lived from 1723 until his death on 14 August 1736. He was aged forty-seven, according to the inscription on the monumental tomb, which was erected by his widow, Elizabeth, in the churchyard of St Andrew's Church, East Hagbourne. The inscription also praised his &#145;skill and diligence in his profession joined with great probity in his dealings&#146;.<br>
<br>John Phillips apparently took over his uncle's business and lived in Thomas Phillips's former house in Brook Street from 1741 until his own death in 1775. Like his uncle, he was an excellent carpenter and joiner, and worked in Oxford on the Radcliffe Library, under James Gibbs (1742&#150;50) and on the library of Christ Church (1752&#150;62). Again following the precedent of his uncle, he built a wooden bridge across the Thames, this time at Battersea, to the designs of Henry Holland (1771&#150;2, demolished 1881). This was the bridge made famous by the paintings and etchings of James McNeill Whistler.<br>
<br>John Phillips was also a master builder of considerable repute, undertaking both speculative building in London and contracts elsewhere. In the former capacity he worked mostly in Mayfair, where he built three very substantial houses in the vicinity of Park Lane (all since demolished), several houses on the Berkeley estate, mainly in the area of Charles Street, and others on the Curzon estate, further to the south. Major contract work included the rebuilding of Alscott House, Warwickshire (1750&#150;64), and alterations at Audley End (1749) and Aubrey House, Notting Hill (1767&#150;9). Phillips also acted as surveyor to the Royal Society of Arts during the rebuilding of its premises as part of the Adelphi development by Robert and James Adam (1772&#150;4). In both his speculative and contract work he often acted in partnership with George Shakespear (<i>d</i>. 1797), who may have been the nephew of that name mentioned in his will.<br>
<br>In later years John Phillips acquired substantial property holdings in the vicinity of East Hagbourne, including the manors of Blewbury in Berkshire and Culham in Oxfordshire, where he rebuilt Culham House for his own occupation. The terms of his will suggest that he had amassed considerable wealth. He died on 28 December 1775, leaving a widow, Mary, but apparently no issue, and was buried at St Andrew's Church, East Hagbourne, on 3 January 1776. He was sixty-six years old, according to the splendid marble monument which was erected to him in the nave of the church by his nephew, another John Phillips, son of his brother William, and the residuary legatee of much of his property.<br>
