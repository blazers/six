<span class="headword">Bartholomew,  (Harry) Guy</span>  (1884&#150;1962), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper company chairman</span>, was born on 17 October 1884 at 191 Belsize Road, Hampstead, London, the elder of two sons of Henry Bartholomew, a warehouseman, and his wife, Kate Shackall, who taught singing. Bart, as he later became known, was deliberately misleading about his origins and upbringing. Partly out of mischief and partly because he thought that it was commercially advantageous, he sometimes pretended to be Jewish. He never publicly dismissed the implausible suggestion that he was the illegitimate son of his first employer, the press baron Lord Northcliffe, whose features and mannerisms he shared. His education was &#145;elementary and perfunctory&#146;  (Edelman, 38). After leaving school at the age of fourteen, Bartholomew served his apprenticeship as an engraver on Alfred Harmsworth's <span class="italic">Illustrated Mail</span>. His technical expertise and fresh thinking were soon evident, and at nineteen he was asked to join the fledgeling <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, two months after it was founded, starting at 30<i>s</i>. a week. Bart's talents were swiftly confirmed and he became assistant to Hannen Swaffer, himself a pioneering art editor. When eventually he succeeded Swaffer, Bartholomew continued to work in the field, as when he engraved blocks on a cross-channel ferry in order to publish the first pictures of a royal visit to Paris. On 20 December 1906 Bartholomew married a widow from Scotland, Bertha Broome (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), daughter of John Shaxton. They had a son, Peter. Bartholomew's wife was seven years older than him.<br>
<br>Aged only twenty-eight, Bartholomew was appointed a director of the newspaper in 1913, by which time he had already played a key role in creating the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> as a mass circulation title, well equipped to report the First World War in unusually graphic and striking fashion. A courageous battlefield photographer, an accomplished artist and cartoonist, and above all, a brilliant picture editor, Bartholomew had technical ability that extended to a key role in developing the Bartlane process of telephoto transmission.<br>
<br>Bart was as interested in content as layout, having a clear notion of how the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> could emulate New York's sensationalist tabloid dailies without necessarily sacrificing its integrity and sense of purpose. Nevertheless, throughout the twenty years that Lord Rothermere owned the paper Bartholomew was rarely consulted upon anything other than pictorial content. Only when falling sales saw the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> sold off as linked companies in late 1933 did Bartholomew seize his opportunity. He was appointed editorial director, and a decade later became chairman of both companies (albeit ceding executive control of the <span class="italic">Pictorial</span> to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40163/', "Cecil Harmsworth King")</script>, nephew of the first Viscount Rothermere).<br>
<br>In 1934, on the basis of advice from the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson, both King and Bartholomew agreed on a change in the ailing <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>'s market strategy. They aimed to attract fresh advertising revenue by targeting young working-class readers with disposable income, and set about transforming it into an American-style tabloid, staffed by a highly professional team of young editors, designers, and reporters (one of whom was Hugh Cudlipp). Market research was crucial to ensuring that the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> pitched its sensationalist reporting and striking layout at just the right level. The paper consciously avoided going too far down-market. Similarly, any editorial move leftwards was very gradual, and it took the Second World War to ensure that, in A. J. P. Taylor's words, &#145;The English people at last found their voice.&#146;  (Edelman, 142). Wartime radicalism, with the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> claiming to speak for ordinary servicemen and women, culminated in the advice &#145;Vote for them&#146; (meaning Labour) in 1945. The general election in that year confirmed the paper's support for Labour, yet Bartholomew distanced himself from the Labour Party leadership, with the notable exception of Herbert Morrison. Ironically, it was Morrison who in March 1942 threatened to suppress the paper over a cartoon by the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s Philip Zec. This showed &#145;a torpedoed sailor with an oil-smeared face lying on a raft in a sinister, empty sea&#146;  (Edelman, 111). A caption read: &#145;The price of petrol has been increased by one penny&#151;official&#146;; and this was meant to emphasize that &#145;casualties as well as prices were rising&#146;  (ibid.). However, it created a furore: questions were asked in the House of Commons, and Morrison warned Bartholomew that the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> must in future refrain from publishing material which might depress public morale. The incident increased Churchill's loathing of the newspaper; and further injury was given to the Conservatives on the eve of the 1951 general election. On 23 October the paper carried eight letters under the heading &#145;Whose finger on the trigger?&#146;, implying that &#145;the country would be safer with Labour's finger on the atomic trigger&#146;  (ibid., 178).<br>
<br>Bartholomew's poor relations with both front benches may explain why there was no official recognition of his major contribution to the British newspaper industry. He was, however, appointed OBE in 1946 for producing <span class="italic">Good Morning</span>, a secret wartime newspaper for submarine crews modelled on the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, and with a now familiar mixture of striking headlines, racy stories, practical advice, punchy sports features, revealing and unusual photo-spreads, and addictive cartoon strips. The same formula had enabled King to relaunch the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s sister paper, the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, in 1937, with similar success.<br>
<br>Bartholomew was a very recognizable figure in Fleet Street in the later 1930s and 1940s: he was short and stocky with seemingly boundless energy, and possessed a great shock of white hair. Although he often seemed rather brusque and ill-mannered, he nevertheless retained the loyalty of his staff, who recognized that he had both the technical expertise, and also the drive necessary to persuade readers in large quantities to buy the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>.<br>
<br>Although chairman of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, Bartholomew saw it as an in-house rival; and his antipathy towards King, Cudlipp, and their team became increasingly irrational. Bartholomew's riposte to King's success was to purchase a rather grubby weekly, <span class="italic">Reveille</span>, and broaden its appeal. Wartime sales of about 100,000, mostly to servicemen, had leapt to 3 million by the end of 1951. However, the Mirror Group had invested heavily after 1945 in west Africa, Canada, and in particular Australia. Not all these initiatives succeeded, and each new enterprise required an enormous amount of time and effort to set up. Moreover, whenever Bartholomew travelled abroad on business he behaved in an increasingly eccentric fashion, while his performance back home was severely affected by heavy drinking: he had always adjourned every evening to Fleet Street's most famous wine bar, El Vino. In December 1951 King and Cudlipp orchestrated a board-room coup, with Bartholomew being replaced as chairman of the Mirror Group by Cecil King. The latter appointed Cudlipp as editorial director.<br>
<br>In 1952 King and Cudlipp nevertheless paid warm tribute to Bartholomew at the Mirror Group's annual general meeting, regaling shareholders with countless stories, some apocryphal and some true, of his relentless determination to score a scoop. Both men collected many of these anecdotes in their respective memoirs. Yet Bartholomew spent his last years in much reduced circumstances: he held no shares in the company he had built up, and had never made proper pension provision. He lived on a modest income established by Philip Zec once it became obvious that the outgoing chairman faced near penury. He retired to his Surrey home, Crawley Hill House, Crawley Hill, Camberley, where he died on 4 May 1962. His son, Peter, a wartime commando and later a regional television executive, survived him. Hugh Cudlipp described Bartholomew as the &#145;godfather of the British tabloids&#146;, and he was undoubtedly one of the most important figures in the history of popular journalism in Britain.<br>
