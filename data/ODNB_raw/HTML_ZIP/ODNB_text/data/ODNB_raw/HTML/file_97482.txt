<span class="headword">Clements,  Richard Harry <span class="st"> [Dick]</span></span>  (1928&#150;2006), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 11 October 1928 at 60 Warwick Gardens, Kensington, London, the third child and second son of Harry Clements, osteopath, and his American-born wife, Sophia Victoria (Sonia), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edelman. His father, born in rural Gloucestershire in the 1890s, had been a conscientious objector during the First World War, and after a spell in jail he spent the rest of the war as a farm labourer in a Tolstoyan community at Whiteway, near Stroud, Gloucestershire. After the war he crossed the Atlantic to join a similar community in New England, where he studied osteopathy. There he met Sonia Edelman, an anarcho-syndicalist of Russian Jewish parentage, whom he married in the early 1920s. After the birth of a son (John) and a daughter (Barbara), the family moved to England, and Harry set up in practice, first at Whiteway and later in London. The practice prospered, and the family moved to Hampstead Garden Suburb so that Dick (as he was universally known throughout his life) and his siblings could go to King Alfred School, a progressive co-educational school nearby.<br>
<br>When the Second World War came and France fell, Clements was sent to the United States to stay with an uncle, John Edelman, who was a well-known Washington lobbyist for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (roughly the equivalent of the British TUC). His formal education continued at Western High School in Washington DC, and he gained a valuable knowledge of American liberal politics by meeting his uncle's friends and colleagues. But after his brother was killed as a pilot in Bomber Command, Clements insisted on returning to England, where the V1 flying bomb campaign was in full swing. He went first to Regent Street Polytechnic to matriculate, then joined the Merchant Navy as an apprentice in 1946.<br>
<br>After eighteen months in the navy Clements won a place at the London School of Economics but he dropped out in 1949 to become a reporter, first on the <span class="italic">Middlesex Independent</span> and then, in 1951, on the <span class="italic">Leicester Mercury</span>. While there, he tried to establish his own left-wing weekly in the midlands. It failed, but it led to an offer in 1953 of the editorship of the Labour Party's youth paper, <span class="italic">Socialist Advance</span>. In 1954 this led in turn to a job as industrial reporter at the TUC-owned <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>. For much of this post-war period he was living with his parents in Baker Street, where his mother kept court over a remarkable assembly of young people, most of them either stray Americans or students at the London School of Economics. On 28 November 1952 he married Bridget Mary MacDonald, the 27-year-old daughter of Alister MacDonald, architect, and granddaughter of the former prime minister Ramsay MacDonald. They had met in a pub near his parents' country cottage, where she was acting as a temporary barmaid. The pub's owner was her aunt, Ishbel MacDonald, daughter of the former prime minister. They had two sons.<br>
<br>After two years at the <span class="italic">Herald</span> Clements was invited in 1956 to join the staff of the left-wing weekly, <span class="italic">Tribune</span>. The paper was then edited by Michael Foot, who was at the time in conflict with his old friend and ally Aneurin Bevan over Bevan's rejection of unilateral nuclear disarmament. With his pacifist background, Clements backed Foot in this dispute, and when he was eventually appointed editor in 1961 he proudly attached the slogan &#145;The Paper that Backs the Anti-H Bomb Campaign&#146; to its masthead. It was to remain there throughout his subsequent twenty-one years in the editor's chair&#151;a stint that covered some of the nastiest and most bad-tempered years in Labour Party history. The easiest part was probably putting the paper together each week. Indeed his greatest achievement may well have been keeping it solvent for twenty-one years, because <span class="italic">Tribune</span> was chronically hard up, and much of the editor's time was taken in raising funds. Among Clements's most successful fund-raisers was Neil Kinnock.<br>
<br>Though firmly committed to democratic socialism, Clements's <span class="italic">Tribune</span> remained a beacon of comradely debate at a time when an array of Trotskyist factions were competing to take over the party. This even-handed fairness, combined with his good humour and optimism, made him liked and respected across the ideological divide&#151;so much so that Jim Callaghan offered to &#145;parachute&#146; him into a safe east London seat just before the 1979 election. Had he accepted, he would almost certainly have sat on Labour's front bench. But he was too much of a democrat to agree to this, and he insisted that there must be several candidates for the local party to choose from. Callaghan gave way, a selection conference took place, and Clements lost.<br>
<br>Clements eventually resigned the editorship in 1982 to become an adviser to Michael Foot when he became leader of the party in succession to Callaghan. He remained in the leader's office after Kinnock succeeded Foot a year later, and stayed there as office manager until 1987, becoming a popular figure at Westminster. After his retirement in 1993 he took a job as director of the Citizens' Income Trust, using his contacts to advance the radical concept of a guaranteed minimum income for all citizens. He retired finally in 1996 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.<br>
<br>Clements's amiability may well have been responsible for the final twist to his career in 1999, when a Soviet defector, Vasily Mitrokhin, named him long after his retirement as a KGB &#145;agent of influence&#146; with the code name Agent Dan. It was claimed that he had been a channel of propaganda for the Soviet Union, printing KGB-inspired articles in <span class="italic">Tribune</span>. Clements laughed this off, pointing out (accurately) that his paper had published masses of anti-communist material. He argued that the KGB agents had probably been exaggerating their successes to impress their bosses, although it is equally possible that they had been deceived by his affability into a belief that he really was on their side.<br>
<br>One surprising aspect of Clements's character was that, in spite of his geniality, he exhibited a ferocious competitive drive in sport. A first-class tennis player (he once took a set off Jaroslav Drobn&yacute;), he was also a fanatical captain of <span class="italic">Tribune</span>'s cricket team, especially in its annual contest with its great rival, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. These confrontations had, in the pre-Clements days, been largely an excuse for a picnic, whose main purpose was the consumption of vast quantities of beer and white wine. Under Clements <span class="italic">Tribune</span> was out to win. People who knew only the affable Clements were startled to encounter this other one. They put it down to his spell in America.<br>
<br>Clements's Parkinsons's disease got progressively worse over the last ten years of his life, and his final months were spent in the Arkley Nursing Home in Barnet (near his home in Strafford Road). He died there of end-stage complications of the disease on 23 November 2006. He was survived by his wife, Bridget, and their two sons.<br>
