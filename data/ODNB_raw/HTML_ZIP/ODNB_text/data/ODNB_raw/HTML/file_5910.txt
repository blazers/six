<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colley, Sir  George Pomeroy  Pomeroy-</span>  (1835&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Dublin on 1 November 1835, the third and youngest son of the Hon. George Francis Colley, formerly Pomeroy (1797&#150;1879), commander in the Royal Navy, of Rathnangan, co. Kildare, and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1 March 1871), third daughter of the Very Revd Thomas Trench, dean of Kildare, and niece of first Baron Ashtown. George Francis, third son of Revd John Pomeroy, fourth Viscount Harberton (1758&#150;1833), assumed the surname Colley in 1830. George junior (who was to assume the additional prefix surname Pomeroy on 8 May 1880), after touring Europe with his parents and receiving his early education at Cheam School (1841&#150;7), entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1849, and passed out first in 1852. He was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in the 2nd foot on 28 May 1852. After service in Ireland and promotion to lieutenant without purchase, Colley was posted to the Cape Frontier with his regiment in August 1854, where he was employed in building a settlement for military colonists, surveying the Transkei, and as a border magistrate. He rejoined his regiment when it was ordered to China in February 1860 and, after receiving promotion to captain on 12 June 1860, saw action at the capture of the Taku (Dagu) forts and in the advance on Peking (Beijing). He returned briefly to the Cape and then entered the Staff College, Camberley, in February 1862. Finding the teaching undemanding, he worked on his own and passed out first in only ten months instead of the usual two years, with the largest aggregate of marks ever obtained. Colley acquired the habit of spending the early hours in the study of subjects, including economics, apart from his chosen profession; he spent his leave on sketching tours and became an accomplished watercolourist. He also played the flautina and, later, became an authority on South African birds. Evelyn Wood believed him the &#145;best instructed soldier I ever met&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">From Midshipman to Field Marshal</span>, 2.112), while Garnet Wolseley thought him &#145;one of the very ablest men I ever knew&#146;  (Wolseley, <span class="italic">Story of a Soldier's Life</span>, 2.317).<br>
<br>Colley was slight in build but well-proportioned, and his receding hairline gave greater prominence to a strong brow, taken to be a mark of his intellect, though his eyes were said to be soft. In the last three years of his life he was bearded. Despite his accomplishments Colley often appeared shy and modest, and was given on occasion to self-doubt. None the less, as Frederick Roberts wrote, Colley was &#145;the kind of Englishman who feels one is equal to three foreigners&#146;  (Royal Archives, Ponsonby MSS, Add MS A36/20, Ponsonby to wife, 3 March 1881).<br>
<br>Having been promoted to a brevet majority on 6 March 1863 (major on 12 May 1875), Colley served as brigade major at Devonport. In 1867 he became an examiner for the Staff College at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1869, however, his appointment to head garrison instruction in England was vetoed on the grounds that he was too junior, and Colley himself turned down the post of military secretary in Bombay. He worked on a number of papers for the War Office, and was then professor of military administration and law at the Staff College from July 1871 to November 1873. During this period he wrote a long article, &#145;Army&#146;, for the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, completing it a few days before being summoned to join Wolseley's Asante expedition in November 1873. Colley, now lieutenant-colonel, demonstrated considerable administrative skills in reorganizing the expedition's carrier transport. He was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring")</script>, those talented officers favoured by and associated with Wolseley.<br>
<br>After receiving his colonelcy and being appointed CB (March 1874) as a result of his services, Colley joined Wolseley's special mission to Natal in February 1875, designed to reform the administration and persuade the colonists to accept a southern Africa federation. Colley acted as colonial treasurer, but unaccountably succumbed to nerves and lapsed into silence in a major speech to the legislative assembly on 20 May, to Wolseley's surprise and consternation. Colley then undertook an extensive tour of the Transvaal, Swaziland, and Mozambique. Having expected to take up a post at Aldershot, Colley found himself instead in April 1876 military secretary to the new viceroy of India, Lord Lytton, and in April 1878 he became the latter's private secretary, a position he held until February 1880. Colley exercised considerable influence, Sir Neville Chamberlain noting on one occasion that, while Colley &#145;is always present but sits away and says nothing&#146; he &#145;has given the Viceroy the key to the discourse and is his real military mentor&#146;  (Forrest, 153). A strong advocate of a &#145;forward policy&#146;, Colley played a significant role in formulating British political and military policy, leading to the Second Anglo-Afghan War in November 1878.<br>
<br>Colley, who was appointed CMG in 1878 and created KCSI on 29 July 1879, chose to remain with Lytton rather than become commandant at Camberley in 1877, and in 1878 he was considered too junior for the Cape command. The duke of Cambridge, the commander-in-chief, regarded Colley as one of those intriguing to get Wolseley the Indian command. Accordingly Wolseley had to fight hard to secure Colley as chief of staff in Zululand in May 1879, and Colley received only the rank of brigadier-general, rather than major-general as Wolseley had wished. With the renewal of the Second Anglo-Afghan War in September 1879 Colley was immediately recalled to India.<br>
<br>Wolseley, however, succeeded in having Colley appointed his successor as governor of Natal, high commissioner for south-eastern Africa, and commander-in-chief in Natal and the Transvaal with the rank of major-general on 24 April 1880. Colley arrived back in South Africa in June at a critical moment with the Boers in the Transvaal, which Britain had annexed in 1877, becoming increasingly restive. The political settlement of Zululand, however, seemed a more pressing problem and Colley was misled as to Boer attitudes by the faulty judgement of Sir Owen Lanyon [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16060/', "Lanyon, Sir (William) Owen")</script>], the British administrator in the Transvaal. On 17 December 1880 a Boer republic was proclaimed and on 20 December a British column, moving from Lydenburg to Pretoria, was fired upon at Bronkhorstspruit. Colley's small force was widely dispersed, though he had initiated a consolidation prior to the outbreak of hostilities by abandoning three posts in the Transvaal. The six remaining imperial garrisons there were all besieged by the Boers. Because he had declined to employ colonial volunteers in the belief that to do so would lead to unacceptable escalation, Colley's field force totalled only twelve infantry companies, with a handful of mounted troops and some seamen landed from HMS <i>Boadicea</i>.<br>
<br>Colley had never exercised independent field command and underestimated the Boers' military capability. His decision to advance before reinforcements reached him and despite wet summer weather, which made all movement difficult, was partly governed by the urgent need to relieve the besieged garrisons. In north Natal, finding his route into the Transvaal blocked by some 2000 Boers at Laing's Nek, Colley attempted a frontal assault on 28 January 1881. On this the last occasion regimental colours were carried into action Colley was repulsed with 197 casualties, including several of his own staff. At Ingogo on 8 February he moved to reopen the line of communications between Newcastle and his base at Mount Prospect, which had been cut by the Boers. He drove them back, but suffered another 150 casualties and was forced to retire to his base. Having been reinforced by a column under Wood and fearing the damage done to British prestige by his reverses, Colley and his acting chief of staff and fellow Wolseley prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Colonel Herbert Stewart, resolved to turn the Boer position at Laing's Nek by seizing the commanding heights of Majuba, some 2000 feet above it. Gladstone's government, newly in office following the 1880 general election, had begun negotiations with the Boers, but Colley regarded the seizure of Majuba as a legitimate move to strengthen the British bargaining position.<br>
<br>It was also said that Colley was urged to further action by his wife. Colley's marriage, on 14 March 1878, to Edith Althea Hamilton, daughter of Major-General Henry Meade &#145;Tiger&#146; Hamilton and sister to a future general, Bruce Hamilton, had taken many by surprise. Edith Colley was regarded as highly intelligent, but also extremely ambitious to the extent that, according to Wood, she &#145;obliterates apparently every thought of the personal danger which [Colley] has undergone&#146;  (Royal Archives, 038/276, Wood to Queen Victoria, 27 Feb 1881). Indeed it was remarked that, when the first train arrived at Pietermaritzburg in October 1880, while Colley stood on the footplate, Lady Colley was at the engine's throttle and, thus, symbolically in control of her husband's destiny. It is clear from Colley's own touching last letter to her, in which he lamented that he could not believe in a hereafter, that he loved her deeply.<br>
<br>Colley chose to take a mixed force from the 58th and 92nd foot and the naval contingent, in all a total of just 365 men, conceivably to allow all to share in the anticipated victory, though some suggested it was intended to give as much prominence to the short-service recruits of the 58th as to the long-service veterans of the 92nd. Colley's aide-de-camp and brother-in-law, Bruce Hamilton, was too ill to accompany the force, but two other future generals were present with the 92nd, Ian Hamilton and Hector MacDonald. After an eight-hour climb to Majuba's summit on the night of 26 February 1881 Colley considered his men too tired to entrench and, in any case, both he and Stewart believed the position impregnable, Colley remarking, &#145;We could stay here for ever&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">First Boer War</span>, 239). On the following morning (27 February), the Boers began to ascend the mountain, making skilful use of dead ground and pinning down the defenders with accurate rifle fire. Indeed, while the defenders suffered 285 casualties including 92 killed, it is estimated that the Boers lost only two dead and four wounded. Panic overtook the British as the Boers reached the summit, and Colley was shot through the head at about 1.30 p.m. while trying to rally his men.<br>
<br>Some 17,000 troops were now on their way to South Africa, but Wood was directed to conclude an armistice; agreement restoring the Transvaal self government was reached on 21 March 1881. Colley's body was brought down from Majuba and buried at Mount Prospect cemetery, Natal, on 1 March 1881. Majuba came to be seen as a national humiliation such that &#145;Remember Majuba&#146; was to become a rallying cry at the time of the South African War in 1899.<br>
<br>After Colley's death Lady Colley played the widow's role to the full. She married on 17 February 1891 Wentworth Blackett Beaumont (1829&#150;1907), MP, from 1906 first Baron Allendale. In the light of this her second marriage and swift and lucrative separation in 1891, Wolseley eventually believed she had married Colley as a matter of convenience. She died on 19 May 1927.<br>
