<span class="headword">Peacham,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>1578, <em>d.</em> in or after 1644), <span class="occ">writer and illustrator</span>, was born in the parish of North Mimms, Hertfordshire, the second son of Henry Peacham (1547&#150;1634) and his wife, Anne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fairclough).<h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>At the time of his son's birth, the elder Henry Peacham was the minister of North Mimms, but in 1578 he also obtained the living of Leverton in Lincolnshire. He does not appear to have left North Mimms for Leverton until 1595, but he then served there until his death in 1634. Before leaving North Mimms, the elder Peacham had created what was to be his enduring monument by writing <span class="italic">The Garden of Eloquence</span> (1577), a book of rhetoric that was to become celebrated.<br>
<br>The younger Henry Peacham went to school near St Albans and then in London. In 1592 he matriculated as a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his BA degree in 1595, proceeding MA in 1598. About this time it appears that he may have visited Modena to study music under the direction of the distinguished composer of madrigals, Orazio Vecchi (1550&#150;1605), whom he later described as &#145;mine owne Master&#146;  (H. Peacham, <span class="italic">Complete Gentleman</span>, 1622, 102). From about 1600 until 1607 Henry Peacham was teaching at Kimbolton School, Huntingdonshire. He was a reluctant schoolmaster, considering such teaching unrewarding and &#145;one of the most laborious callings in the World&#146;  (H. Peacham, <span class="italic">The Truth of our Times</span>, 1638, 19). Nevertheless, he had grudging recourse to the profession throughout his life.<br>
<br>While still at Cambridge, and at the age of seventeen, Peacham produced a work that reflected what was to be his lifelong interest in the graphic arts. This was his drawing of a scene from <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> done about 1595, commonly accepted as the earliest illustration of a Shakespeare play. In subsequent years Peacham was to produce numerous portraits and emblem plates, as well as write instructional works in the graphic arts. His <span class="italic">Art of Drawing</span> (1606), a treatise on drawing and watercolours, was reissued in 1607, and expanded as <span class="italic">Graphice</span> (1612). <span class="italic">Graphice</span> was further expanded and published again in 1634 and 1661 as <span class="italic">The Gentleman's Exercise</span>, one of Peacham's most widely read works.<br>
<br>About 1603 Peacham turned to another of the arts and composed the words and music of a four-part madrigal, &#145;Awake softly with singing, Oriana sleeping&#146;. This was not published, but is found at the end of the third manuscript version of his emblem book based on <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span> (1603).<h2>
<a name="Earlyemblembooks"></a>Early emblem books</h2>Peacham had begun to explore the emblem convention in the early 1600s, and his contribution to emblem literature was ultimately to be both substantial and significant. His career as an emblem writer began in 1603 when he presented a few emblems of his own composition to James I in Huntingdon on 27&#150;9 April as the new king was making his way south. This occasion was probably the beginning of Peacham's efforts to obtain preferment at court. Between 1603 and 1610 he composed three emblem books, each of them surviving only in undated manuscript form. They are each based on <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span> (1599), the king's own book of advice to his young son. The earliest, composed in 1603&#150;4, is dedicated to Prince Henry, the two later manuscripts, probably written about 1604&#150;5 and in 1610, are dedicated respectively to the king himself and again to Prince Henry.<br>
<br>The earliest of Peacham's manuscript emblem books contains fifty-six pen-and-ink pictures (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. poet. 146), the second book has sixty-five such plates (BL, Harleian MS 6855, art. 13), and the third has seventy-eight (BL, Royal MS 12, A. lxvi). The last differs from the other two in having the plates completed in watercolour. Peacham's work as an emblem writer shows him to have been keenly aware of the symbolism of colour. The plan that he generally follows with each emblem is to base it on a quotation that he has selected from the 1603 edition of <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span>, interpret the picture in four lines of Latin, and add a motto, sometimes in Greek.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1607 Peacham appears to have moved to London, where his first known address was Fetter Lane. Some time before 1612 he moved again, this time to the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, where Sara, one of his two daughters, was baptized in the parish church on 27 April. Neither the name of Peacham's wife nor the dates of his marriage and the birth of his other daughter have been established.<br>
<br>While at St Martin-in-the-Fields Peacham produced his most serious work to date, the emblem book <span class="italic">Minerva Britanna, or, A Garden of Heroical Devises</span> (1612). Of its 204 emblems some sixty-two are derived from those of his three <span class="italic">Basilikon Doron</span> emblem-book manuscripts. But <span class="italic">Minerva Britanna</span> departs in important respects from his previous emblem works. The interpretative verse is in English, and many of the repeated plates differ in detail. Like the manuscript emblems those of <span class="italic">Minerva Britanna</span> are generally of the kind that has been labelled &#145;diagrammatic&#146;. That is, the pictures present a number of different symbols assembled together to represent a single idea.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Minerva Britanna</span> may properly be regarded as belonging to the earliest group of English emblem books. Its emblematic woodcuts are believed to be Peacham's own work. If so, his ability to conceive and execute his own designs meant that he had no need of the sometimes massive borrowing of plates to which other emblem writers perforce resorted. Although the pictures used in <span class="italic">Minerva Britanna</span> are of no great distinction they are, for the most part, simple, direct, and wholly relevant to Peacham's needs. The accompanying verse interpreting each plate is, similarly, competent rather than graceful. Although the range of Peacham's topics is wide, very many of them are familiar. He acknowledges numerous sources and it is easy to identify others. For example, like so many of his contemporaries, he draws heavily upon Cesare Ripa's <span class="italic">Iconologia</span> (1593) and to a lesser extent upon Spenser's <span class="italic">The Faerie Queene</span> (1596).<br>
<br>In 1612, shortly after Peacham moved to St Martin-in-the-Fields, Prince Henry, whose patronage he had so carefully sought, died. Although he was only eighteen years of age at the time of his death, the prince's accomplishments and his exciting promise were so universally respected as to make his passing a national disaster. From the flood of literary tributes to him a new kind of elegiac writing emerged. It was a genre at which Peacham was to excel and he began in this kind with <span class="italic">The Period of Mourning</span> (1613), lamenting the prince.<h2>
<a name="EuropeantravelandTheCompleteGentleman"></a>European travel and The Complete Gentleman</h2>Not long after the death of Prince Henry, and perhaps in some measure as a consequence, Peacham left England in order to travel, principally in France, Germany, and the Low Countries. On this tour he clearly sought every opportunity of enlarging his already wide interests and of acquiring a substantial part of his ultimately considerable learning.<br>
<br>Peacham's progress through Europe terminated at Utrecht where he &#145;lived at the table of that Honourable Gentleman, Sir <i>John Ogle</i>, Lord Governour of the town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Gentleman</span>, 195). Ogle was a man of learning, and it was said that the company which assembled at his house effectively constituted an academy. Greatly to Peacham's advantage, he and Ogle became friends. While in Utrecht with Ogle, Peacham completed <span class="italic">Prince Henrie Revived</span> (1615), a lofty poem in honour of the birth in 1614 of Prince Henry Frederick, the son of Princess Elizabeth and the count palatine.<br>
<br>It was through Ogle that Peacham gained some knowledge of military affairs. In writing of his experiences Peacham does not make it clear whether he was, himself, a fighting member of the protestant forces in the Netherlands, but he was certainly with the section of Colonel Ogle's regiment that served under the command of Prince Maurice of Nassau in the autumn of 1614. Peacham's account of events was published as <span class="italic">A most True Relation of the Affaires of Cleve and Gulick</span> (1615). By the time this appeared Peacham was back in England, and had returned to teaching. He took up a post at the free grammar school in Wymondham, Norfolk, about 1615 and remained there until 1620.<br>
<br>Peacham's sojourn in Norfolk is noteworthy for the friends and acquaintances he made and for the publication of his next substantial work, <span class="italic">Thalia's Banquet</span> (1620), a book of epigrams. Many of the 127 epigrams are dedicated to his recent acquaintances. The composition of epigrams was not a new departure for Peacham since his first publication after his removal to London in 1607 had also been a collection of epigrams, <span class="italic">The More the Merrier</span> (1608). Among those persons of some consequence that Peacham came to know while living in Norfolk were William Howard, the young son of the earl of Arundel, and Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset. He was to honour both of them in print.<br>
<br>By 1621 Peacham had returned to London and was teaching in St Martin-in-the-Fields. At this time he completed his <span class="italic">Emblemata varia</span>, the last of his four emblem books to survive only in manuscript. It is a much shorter work than any of the others, having only twenty emblems, none of them being used for the second time, and all of them presented with uncharacteristic economy. There is a striking absence of the marginal annotations found in Peacham's previous emblem books. The following year Peacham was living at Hoxton.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Complete Gentleman</span> (1622), which Peacham finished after his return to London, is probably his best-known work, and it occupies a significant place in the history of courtesy literature. Its immediate inspiration was Peacham's conviction, arising from his continental tour, that the education of young English gentlemen was markedly inferior to that afforded to European gentry. By now the courtesy book was being addressed to an audience less markedly aristocratic, and although <span class="italic">The Complete Gentleman</span> was for the use of William Howard it is clear that Peacham sought popular appeal. <span class="italic">The Complete Gentleman</span> offers advice over a wide range of topics with humour and sagacity, and reflects many aspects of Peacham's experience. It is not surprising that he should attribute poor education to the remissness of parents, nor that he wrote with urgency about painting and drawing. Several chapters have become classic statements, like that &#145;Of poetry&#146; which was to be frequently quoted as a summary of contemporary views. The learning displayed here offers ample justification for Peacham's claim &#145;By profession I am a Scholler&#146;  (<span class="italic">Graphice</span>, 1612, sig. A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>No later than 1624 Peacham had returned to East Anglia, and was working as a schoolmaster in Boston. At this time he produced <span class="italic">An Aprill Shower</span>, the elegy on Richard Sackville, earl of Dorset. Although Peacham had enjoyed Lord Dorset's benevolence it was apparently not for long, and, now, once more, an untimely death deprived him of a patron. It is not clear how long Peacham's teaching appointment in Boston extended, but in 1632 he was given a temporary post at Heighington Free School, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In 1629 Frances Rich, countess of Warwick, invited Peacham to design for her a monument to be erected on her death in Snarford church, Lincolnshire. It was a task for which Peacham's talents were admirably suited; but Lady Warwick changed her mind, and the plan remained unused. In his elegy for her, <span class="italic">Thestylis atrata</span> (1634), Peacham writes of the &#145;many favors&#146; that he had received from her. If these words are more than conventional it appears that death had yet again robbed him of the patronage he so obviously desired. The ten years between 1624 and 1634 which Peacham spent in East Anglia were relatively unproductive. But to this period there does belong the appearance in 1627 and 1634 of the important second and third editions of <span class="italic">The Complete Gentleman</span> and the 1634 edition of <span class="italic">The Gentleman's Exercise</span>.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>After concluding his period of teaching at Heighington School in 1635 Peacham appears to have returned, once more, to London. The final years of his life are obscure. He has recorded that some time during this period he was &#145;exercised in another calling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Truth of our Times</span>, 1638, 41), though its nature is unknown. But there was a recrudescence of his creative energy, and between 1636 and 1642 he published ten prose works. Most of these might be described as pamphlets, and their variety&#151;from comic to polemic&#151;has led to the speculation that Peacham was existing in poverty and making a living with his pen.<br>
<br>As a comic writer Peacham began with <span class="italic">Coach and Sedan</span> (1636), an exuberant piece of humorous writing cast in the form of a dialogue in which various modes of transport are considered. In a more serious vein he produced <span class="italic">The Truth of our Times</span> (1638), fundamentally an unembittered recollection of a lifetime's disappointments. Stylistically, this is among the best books Peacham ever wrote in prose, and he appears to have had especial affection for the work. <span class="italic">The Worth of a Peny</span> (1641), essentially a simple exhortation to thrift, was one of Peacham's most popular pieces (ten editions appearing in the seventeenth century alone). With the approach of civil war Peacham, a man of royalist and Anglican sympathies, joined in the current religious controversy with a polemic, <span class="italic">The Duty of All True Subjects</span> (1639), that makes his position clear. He deplores the zeal of those who would reform the monarchy and the church, and continued this theme with three more pamphlets in 1641 and 1642.<br>
<br>One of the happiest aspects of Peacham's life in these final years was his collaboration with Wenceslaus Hollar, the great Dutch engraver. Hollar had been brought to England by the earl of Arundel in 1636 and employed in creating a pictorial record of various objects in Arundel's celebrated collection of works of art and antiquities. All told Hollar and Peacham collaborated in producing six pictorial engravings with accompanying text by Peacham. The first of these, done in 1637, was an engraving of Giulio Romano's &#145;Seleucus and Son&#146; to which Peacham provided accompanying Latin verse. This was their only joint product that was based on an item in Arundel's collection. The others depict a view of Greenwich (1637), a diptych of Richard II and the Virgin Mary (1639), a broadside emblem <span class="italic">En surculus arbor</span> (1641), a satirical work (1641?), and the interior of the Royal Exchange (1644).<br>
<br>The precise date and place of Peacham's death have not been satisfactorily established. Although there are some contemporary references, the evidence they provide is conflicting. It seems most likely that he was still alive when Hollar's engraving of the Royal Exchange, to which he contributed Latin and English verse, was published in 1644.<br>
