<span class="headword">Colt,  Henry Shapland <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">golf course architect</span>, was born on 4 August 1869, in Bishopwood House, Highgate, when his first name was given as Henry (though he was always known as Harry), the son of George Nathaniel Colt, a barrister, and his wife Georgiana Ellen Bruce. He was educated at Monkton Combe School and at Clare College, Cambridge (1887&#150;90), where he read law and graduated BA in 1890. He first began to play golf during the summer holiday of 1880 when, as &#145;a tall red-haired schoolboy&#146;, he hit a ball among the lamp-posts, ditches, and washing lines of the common at Malvern Wells, the original course of the Worcestershire Golf Club  (Colt and Alison, ix). He played for Cambridge against Oxford in 1889 and captained the team the following year. With his great friend John Low he helped found the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society, and was a member of its convivial early touring sides. After leaving Cambridge he joined the Royal and Ancient club: he won the jubilee vase in 1891 and 1893, played four times in the amateur championships (he reached the semi-final at Hoylake in 1906), and made a single international appearance, for England against Scotland in 1908. From 1897 he was a member of the Royal and Ancient rules of golf committee.<br>
<br>Colt began his working life as a solicitor and in 1893 moved to Hastings, where he practised with the firm Sayer and Colt. In April 1894 he married Charlotte Laura Dewar (1864&#150;1948), younger daughter of the Revd David E. Dewar. They afterwards lived at The Priory, St Margaret's Road, St Leonards. Colt began his architectural career as an amateur at Rye Golf Club, where, as captain, he laid out the course. He was honorary secretary at Rye (1896&#150;9) and was still overseeing tee construction there when, in 1901, the Sunningdale club advertised for its first secretary. Colt was impressively qualified for the post, to which he was appointed in July, and he moved to Ascot. He proved a popular secretary at Sunningdale, though he was a hard taskmaster with an &#145;austere, authoritarian front&#146;: his maxim was &#145;the member is always right&#146;  (Hawtree, 37).<br>
<br>It was at Sunningdale that Colt began the transition to professional golf course designer. The burgeoning of golf clubs on the sandy heath lands around London at the end of the nineteenth century led to a corresponding growth in golf course design and, alongside Herbert Fowler and J. F. Abercromby, Colt became one of the leading architects of the day. He was painstaking in his approach to detail and saw his commissions through from pegging out to the opening day. He had a special reverence for the old course at St Andrews, the layout of which influenced his work. Without destroying the natural beauty of a site he aimed to create courses that were challenging and exciting to golfers of differing levels of skill. He gave advice about the maintenance of the old and new courses at St Andrews, where he built the Eden course (1914); he also created Stoke Poges (1908), Swinley Forest (1910), and St George's Hill (1913). Before the First World War he made two extended trips to North America, where he built the Toronto golf course (1912) and assisted George Crump in the construction of the famous Pine valley course at Clementon, New Jersey.<br>
<br>As a designer Colt was aware of the social tensions arising in England from the great expansion of golf as a middle-class game. In cases where objections from local residents were likely, he saw &#145;an instrumental value in encouraging some key artisans to play&#146;, and in some places working men's clubs were established under the auspices of parent bodies  (Lowerson, 142). But this arrangement did nothing to challenge the social distinctions that were already entrenched in the game. And Colt's own paternalistic attitude was apparent in a series of articles that he contributed to <span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span>, in July and August 1909, on the subject of &#145;The caddie evil&#146;. The proliferation of middle-class golfers had met with a proliferation of working-class caddies, and Colt shared a general concern that the game was creating &#145;a rotten class of loafer unfit for any sort of occupation other than that of carrying a few golf clubs round a course for a few hours a day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Golf Illustrated</span>, 30 July 1909, 149). He wanted the work of caddies restricted to boys, since he believed that it was unsuitable for able-bodied men; in other respects he was advanced in his thinking, and advocated, for example, the proper regulation of caddies as a profession. At Sunningdale he even introduced evening classes of a vocational nature to help prepare them for future employment.<br>
<br>Colt's external activities multiplied after 1906, while his value to the Sunningdale committee in no way lessened, and a compromise was reached whereby he was given increasing time to pursue his own work. But the inevitable could not long be delayed and in 1913 he resigned as secretary. He entered into partnership with C. H. Alison and Alister MacKenzie, both of whom undertook substantial work in North America. Business inevitably stagnated during the First World War and Colt, who was not wanted for military service, moved from Ascot to St Amand's House, East Hendred. There he bought an apple orchard, and became a justice of the peace and a deputy commissioner for the south-west area of the Ministry of Food. After the war he re-emerged at the height of his powers, initially in partnership with Alison and MacKenzie, but from 1928 with the more enduring combination of Alison and John S. F. Morrison. The firm of Colt, Alison, and Morrison Ltd remained a prominent force in British golf design for a decade after Colt's death.<br>
<br>Colt's list of courses after 1918 is an impressive one. He designed the new course at Sunningdale (1922), Moor Park West (1923), Burning Tree, Bethesda, Maryland (1924), Wentworth (1924), Milwaukee country club, Wisconsin (1929), and the sea course at Le Touquet (1930). He also created &#145;scores of others, not all so well-known, but every one attractive to the eye and to the golfer&#146;  (Colt and Alison, xi). His remodelling guaranteed the future pre-eminence of courses such as Muirfield, Lytham St Annes, Ganton, Porth-cawl, and Formby. Many would perhaps agree that &#145;his masterpiece&#146; was Royal Portrush, co. Antrim, &#145;a magnificent natural course which he almost entirely reconstituted and lived to see chosen for the open championship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Nov 1951). Colt remained active after the Second World War but his powers waned as he grew increasingly deaf and concerned about his wife's health. He died at St Amand's House on 21 November 1951. Colt had an important influence on the post-war generation of golf course designers, having &#145;spanned the whole popular development of golf from rugged beginnings to modern refinement both in layout and construction&#146;  (Colt and Alison, xiii).<br>
