<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Theobald</span> <span class="st"> [Teab&oacute;id Gallduf]</span>  (1589&#150;1647), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and author</span>, was born in the diocese of Cashel, the son of John Stapleton and his wife, Fionnuala McNamara. He was taught Latin by Maurice Beggan in Tipperary before entering the Irish College in Salamanca in December 1609. A second Theobald Stapleton, also an Irish priest, was a contemporary of the first, and it is not always possible to distinguish between the two. However, it seems the first Stapleton was the student involved in the founding of the Irish College in Seville in 1612. Stapleton himself mentioned that he was ordained in 1616 and said his first mass in the chapel of the Incarnation in the royal palace in Madrid on 25 March of that year.<br>
<br>It seems that Stapleton returned to Ireland in the early 1620s and spent twelve consecutive years in pastoral work there. During this time he decided to produce an Irish catechism for the proper instruction of the uneducated laity. The work was printed by Hubert Velpius in Brussels in 1639 and dedicated to Cardinal Don Fernando, infante of Spain and governor of the Spanish Netherlands. It is likely that Stapleton was in Flanders at the time of publication, and indeed there is evidence of a Theobald Stapleton in the royal court in Brussels in 1635. The catechism, in Latin called <span class="italic">Catechismus, seu, Doctrina Christiana Latino-Hibernica</span>, contains parallel columns of Latin and Irish and is in the form of a dialogue between master and pupil. In the preface Stapleton claims that Irish is in decline and blames the literati, who prefer obscurity to intelligibility, and the aristocracy, who, despising Irish, are eager to learn foreign languages. Since the bardic schools had ceased to function after the collapse of the Gaelic order at the beginning of the century, Stapleton's criticism of the learned class is a literary commonplace rather than a reflection of contemporary reality. Protestant devotional works in Irish had already appeared in roman characters in Scotland, but Stapleton's catechism was the first Catholic book in Irish to be printed in roman rather than Gaelic type. It was also the first serious attempt to simplify the orthography of Irish by removing quiescent letters.<br>
<br>Stapleton returned to Ireland at some time in or before 1647, when he became caught up in the confederate wars. As one of the priests who sought refuge in Cashel Cathedral, he was killed there on 14 September 1647 by troops of Murrough O'Brien, Lord Inchiquin, who successfully sacked the city during that month.<br>
