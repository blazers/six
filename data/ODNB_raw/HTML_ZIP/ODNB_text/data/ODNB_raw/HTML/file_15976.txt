<span class="headword">Landmann,  George Thomas</span>  (1780&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer and military engineer</span>, was born on 11 April 1780 at Woolwich, Kent, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15977/', "Isaac Landmann (1741&#150;1826)")</script>, professor of artillery and fortification at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and his wife, Helene. Nothing is known of his school education. He became a cadet at the Royal Military Academy on 16 April 1793 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 1 May 1795. Stationed at Plymouth, he was employed in the fortification of St Nicholas's Island, and, while at Falmouth, similarly Pendennis Castle and St Mawes. Promoted first lieutenant on 3 June 1797, later that year he went to Canada. He was involved in the construction of fortifications at St Joseph on Lake Huron, Upper Canada, and at Quebec in 1799 distinguished himself by dousing with snow a dangerous fire on the roof of a magazine. During 1801 and 1802 he was employed in cutting a new canal at the Cascades on the St Lawrence River. He advanced to captain-lieutenant on 13 July 1802 and at the end of the year returned to England. In 1803&#150;4 he was at Winchester and then moved to Portsmouth, where he helped to strengthen its defences and those of neighbouring Gosport.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1804 Landmann became second captain, and on 23 February 1806 he joined the garrison at Gibraltar. His amusing and lively journal, written there, included numerous anecdotes about social and military events, as well as acute observations on the character and demeanour of a wide range of individuals. He had several personal mishaps and adventures, which included falling off a ladder, so that &#145;the tip bone of my left elbow was split&#146;  (Landmann, 1.36), in July 1807 having pieces of flannel soaked in boiling water pressed liberally on his stomach to combat cholera, and, the following year, chasing a whale in a ship's boat. He showed a deep interest in, and knowledge of, botany, cultivating his own exotic garden. However, he failed to rise above &#145;the humblest mediocrity&#146; when seeking to play the Spanish guitar, though he &#145;made some progress&#146; in learning to paint miniatures  (ibid., 1.229). His house displayed a library of more than 1000 volumes and sixteen pictures. Promoted captain on 1 July 1806, he sailed on 14 May 1808 as commanding royal engineer with Major-General Brent Spencer's force, which took part in the blockade of six French warships anchored in Cadiz under the guns of hostile Spanish batteries. Fluent in Spanish, he went ashore to liaise with the garrison, and he witnessed at first hand the bombardment, which preceded the enemy's surrender. On 8 August Spencer's force landed at Mondego Bay to join Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington). Landmann was then attached to the light brigade under Brigadier-General the Hon. Henry Fane, and was present at the battle of Roli&ccedil;a on 17 August, when he succeeded Captain Howard Elphinstone, who was wounded, as commanding royal engineer. On 18 August he sketched a panoramic view of the battlefield, which Wellesley sent home with dispatches. During a lone reconnaissance two days before the battle of Vimeiro, Landmann was almost captured by French dragoons. In the fighting, on 21 August, for a short period he acted as aide-de-camp to Brigadier-General Robert Anstruther, then joined Fane's brigade to take part in the capture of a French field gun. After the battle, for which he received a gold medal, he delivered a sketch of the engagement to Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Burrard, who had succeeded Wellesley in command of the army. After commanding the Royal Engineers for ten days, during which he displayed his &#145;great repugnance to the flogging system&#146;  (ibid., 2.277) by reducing a sentence of 300 lashes to 25, he was superseded by Major Richard Fletcher on 26 August. The following month, he was sent to report on the fortress of Peniche, and when Fletcher went to Spain with Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, he became commanding engineer in Portugal. In December he was ordered to construct a bridge of boats at Abrantes, on the River Tagus, another at Punhete, on the Z&ecirc;zere, and a flying bridge at Vila Velha, all of which were completed in five days.<br>
<br>On his return to Lisbon, Landmann was, in February 1809, sent overland with dispatches to Bartholomew Frere, the British minister at Seville, and from there, as commanding engineer, to join Major-General Alexander Mackenzie's force at Cadiz. Soon after his arrival, rioters threatened to kill the governor, the marqu&eacute;s de Villel, suspecting his loyalty. Mackenzie sent Landmann to restore order, and, as he spoke Spanish so well, he was eventually able to calm the situation. For his services on this occasion he received the thanks of Ferdinand VII, the king of Spain. He was granted a commission as lieutenant-colonel in the Spanish engineers on 22 February 1809, and when Mackenzie and his troops left for Lisbon, he remained at Cadiz on Frere's request. He went back to Gibraltar in July and sent home plans of the fortifications of Cadiz, with a report which led to vigorous efforts being made to defend the port.<br>
<br>Following the French capture of Seville, an attack on Gibraltar was expected from the landward side. So, in January 1810, plans were drawn up to demolish forts San Felipe and Santa Barbara in the Spanish lines, for which, after difficult negotiations, Landmann secured the Spanish governor's agreement. When the French marched on Cadiz in February, he volunteered to accompany reinforcements embarked at Gibraltar, but with that force detained by a contrary wind, he hired a rowing boat, reached Cadiz on the second day, and found himself for a time commanding engineer of the British forces.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1810 Landmann was appointed colonel of infantry in the Spanish army, and in April he served at the siege of Matagorda. During August he returned to England through ill health, but four months later had recovered sufficiently to sail for Lisbon as one of the military agents in the Peninsula. After delivering dispatches to Wellington at Cartaxo he proceeded towards Cadiz, and on the way joined the Spanish division of Major-General Francisco Ballasteros, being present at the action at Castillejos, near the River Guadiana, on 7 January 1811, where his horse fell under him and he sustained an injury to his left eye. From Cadiz, he returned in June to Ayamonte and rode round the seacoast to Corunna. After a short stay in Galicia, he went back to Cadiz by another route.<br>
<br>In March 1812 Landmann sailed for England with the Spanish ambassador. His health was now so impaired that he was unable to resume active duty until July 1813, when he was sent to Ireland to command the engineers in the Lough Swilly district in co. Donegal. On 4 June 1813 he had been promoted brevet major, and he became lieutenant-colonel on 16 May 1814. In March 1815 he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the Thames district, and in May 1817 was transferred to Hull in a similar capacity for the Yorkshire district. Landmann was granted leave of absence in 1819 and appears to have continued on leave until he retired from the corps on 29 December 1824. In the 1830s he was a promoter and the chief engineer of the London and Greenwich Railway. He also revised his father's <span class="italic">Principles of Fortifications</span> in 1831. He died at Shacklewell, near Hackney, London, on 27 August 1854.<br>
