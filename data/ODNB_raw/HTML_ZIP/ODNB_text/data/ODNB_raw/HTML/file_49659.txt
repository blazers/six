<span class="headword">Arnold,  Mary Anne</span>  (<em>b. </em>1825), <span class="occ">sailor and cross-dresser</span>, was born in Sheerness, Kent, and may have been the daughter of Lieutenant Arnold of the Royal Navy who served aboard the <i>Ganges</i> and <i>Prince Regent</i> men-of-war. According to a report in <span class="italic">The Times</span> following her detection in October 1839, an officer of the <i>Robert Small</i> claimed she was the daughter of the late Lieutenant Arnold who retired with his family to Sheerness after his last commission. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span> Lieutenant Arnold &#145;continued his habits of dissipation&#146; and was admitted to the Greenwich Hospital where he died in 1839. Mrs Arnold had supported herself and their family of four children through manual labour until her death in 1835. Mary Anne herself told the lord mayor of London that she was born in Sheerness, orphaned, and from the age of ten supported herself by working as a farm labourer and running errands before finding permanent employment in a rope-making factory in Sheerness. There she earned 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week.<br>
<br>Mary Anne may have been inspired by her two older brothers to escape the drudgery of factory life for the sea; one brother was boatswain of the <i>Royal Adelaide</i> and the other a carpenter aboard the <i>Britannia</i>, to whom his sister had divulged her secret. Perhaps because of them, she went &#145;frequently in boats and amongst the shipping she found that boys of her age who went to sea were better fed were &#147;thought more of&#148; and in every way in a superior condition to her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). In 1835 she borrowed an old jacket, trousers, and shirt from a male friend on the pretext that she was &#145;going to have a lark in them&#146; and signed up as a cabin-boy aboard the <i>Williams</i>, a Sutherland collier lying at Sheerness. She worked aboard the <i>Williams</i> as a cabin-boy above and below decks for more than two years and to the satisfaction of six captains.<br>
<br>As Mary Anne later told the lord mayor, &#145;I was a strong boy in appearance and I had great strength &hellip; far beyond my years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>). But she disliked the last captain she worked for, so left the <i>Williams</i> in October 1838 and signed on with the <i>Annie</i> at Shields, bound for London and Quebec. When the <i>Annie</i> was shipwrecked at Blakeney off the Norfolk coast, Mary Anne then joined the <i>Choice</i> bound for London with stores for the <i>Robert Small</i> East Indiaman. Her true identity was discovered in October 1839 while she was working as a cabin-boy aboard the <i>Robert Small</i> <i>en route</i> back to London from Calcutta. She appeared before the lord mayor of London in July 1840 &#145;to ask assistance for a few weeks before her departure to India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>). Her story was widely reported in the London press.<br>
<br>Witnesses to her story, like many nineteenth-century accounts of female sailors, record that Mary Anne was considered a valuable member of the crew, even excelling in a crisis. As an officer reported to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;She has well done her work as a strong active boy on this ship. I have seen Miss Arnold among the first aloft to reef the mizen-top-gallant [the highest] sail during a heavy gale in the Bay of Biscay&#146;. She described herself as &#145;able to do the hardest work in the ship &hellip; I am sure I was as strong as any <i>other</i> man in the ship and there was no labour I was not able to perform&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>). But the captain became suspicious of her &#145;after she submitted to the ceremony of tarring and shaving in its roughest form&#146; when the <i>Robert Small</i> crossed the equator.<br>
<br>On the captain's orders, Mary Anne was inspected by the ship's surgeon and explained to the crew how she became a sailor. However, once her true identity was revealed, she was dispatched to a cabin where &#145;the lady passengers have given her lots of presents [and] her hair is already getting long and &hellip; she will soon think of ringlets&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Meanwhile, the captain assured his former cabin-boy that even though she was now wearing women's clothes again and unable to perform her duties, she would receive her full pay when the ship docked in London. By then she was earning &pound;4 11<i>s</i>. a month.<br>
<br>Aboard ship Mary Anne was received as a &#145;heroine&#146;. &#145;Miss Arnold is, though, rather bashful considering the short time she has had to learn ladies' ways, but like other heroes and heroines, capable of being drawn out&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). But after docking in London she appeared at Mansion House with a female friend to ask the lord mayor to pay for her room and board until she could return to India. &#145;She thought she could be of service to ladies who travelled for she was never sea sick in her life and was not afraid of anything&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>). After making an awkward curtsey to Mr Hobler, the lord mayor's assistant, who paid her in cash, Mary Anne left the room. Nothing is known of her subsequent life.<br>
