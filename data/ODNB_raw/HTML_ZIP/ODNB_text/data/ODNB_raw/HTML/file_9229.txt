<span class="headword">Fawkes,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1720, <em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was the son of Jeremiah Fawkes, rector of Warmsworth, Doncaster. He was baptized there on 4 April 1720, and educated at Bury Free School. He was admitted as a sizar at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1738, being soon afterwards awarded an exhibition there; in 1742 he was made a scholar, and graduated BA; he took his MA in 1745. Fawkes took holy orders, and obtained a curacy at Bramham in Yorkshire, where he acted as chaplain to two local landowners, Mr Fox and Mr Lane. The charms of Mr Lane's house at Bramham were celebrated in Fawkes's first poetic publication (1745). Fawkes later moved to a curacy at Croydon. His poetic efforts may have attracted the notice of Archbishop Thomas Herring, either in Yorkshire (where Herring as archbishop of York had vigorously supported the government) or in the south (after Herring was translated to Canterbury); Fawkes wrote an ode on Herring's recovery from sickness in 1754. On 24 July 1755 at St Peter's, Leeds, he married Ann (<i>bap</i>. 1719), daughter of Salisbury Purrier. In the same year Herring rewarded him with the vicarage of Orpington, Kent: but his patron's death cut short further preferment from this modest beginning, and it was not until 1774 that Fawkes managed to obtain the adjacent rectory of Hayes by the favour of his own rector, the Revd Charles Plumptree. He became chaplain to the princess dowager of Wales. Overall, Fawkes's clerical career was undistinguished; in an age that tolerated much laxity in its parsons, he seems to have pursued enjoyment to the detriment of ambition. It is in some ways a fitting career for so effortless a classicist: Epicurus, with his injunction to live in happy obscurity, would not have disapproved.<br>
<br>Fawkes used the pseudonym Eugenio when translating Edmond Halley's interesting Latin prefatory poem to Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span>. Latin poetry on scientific subjects was still taken seriously; it has been suggested that Halley's work veered dangerously close to the atheistic principles of Lucretius, but many more orthodox contemporaries of Fawkes, such as Isaac Hawkins Browne, also indulged in the didactic genre. Fawkes dedicated to his Yorkshire friend William Dixon his interesting modernization of Gawin Douglas's <span class="italic">Description of the May</span> (1752), a reflection of the eighteenth-century desire to see medieval poetry in a more comprehensible, less off-puttingly archaic form. Douglas is picturesque, elegant, and esteemed, &#145;which is all the apology I shall make for having given it an English dress&#146;. He prints the old Scots and his version on facing pages, encouraging close comparisons. So, on Chanticleer's two wives:<blockquote>
<div>For cocks, that couple with their nearest kin,<br>
</div>
<div>Hold bygamy a pardonable sin<br>
</div>
</blockquote>while Douglas has: &#145;As bird al tyme that hantis bygamy&#146; (the glossary states: &#145;<i>hant</i>, to frequent, use&#146;). Fawkes's version seems to nod elegantly at the opening of Dryden's <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>.<br>
<br>Fawkes's anonymous translation of Anacreon, &#145;by a Gentleman of Cambridge&#146; (1760), declares, with modesty typical of an eighteenth-century versifier, that some of the poems had been<blockquote>translated several years ago at College for the Author's amusement &hellip; [since] no one of this nation had hitherto furnished him [Anacreon] with a graceful Habit. Mr John Addison's translation, excepting a few odes, is harsh and crude, and far from being well done. (Fawkes, <span class="italic">Works of Anacreon</span>)</blockquote>He is here ignoring or dismissing the huge interest in <i>Anacreontea</i> among seventeenth-century poets (Abraham Cowley most notably, but also Thomas Stanley, Robert Herrick, John Oldham, and Lord Rochester). John Addison's <span class="italic">Works of Anacreon and Sappho</span> (1735) would have been recently published when Fawkes, as an undergraduate, was allegedly improving on it. Fawkes admits he may be rash in taking on Sappho as well. Comparing his Sappho with John Addison's, there is no very clear improvement, but perhaps a veiling of passion; thus Addison has:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">yet I<br>
</div>
<div>Alone, deserted, pining lie!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>alongside Fawkes: &#145;And yet, alas! I lie alone&#146;  (Poole and Maule, 104&#150;5). It is debatable whether Fawkes's slight understatement is an advantage. Fawkes offers some footnotes, showing awareness of modern critics; on Sappho's second ode he cites Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (no. 229) and Mme Dacier, but appears not to notice Catullus 51, the most famous of imitations  (Fawkes, <span class="italic">Works of Anacreon</span>, 185). He translates Anacreon's fourth ode effectively:<blockquote>
<div>Our Frame no symmetry retains;<br>
</div>
<div>Nought but a little dust remains,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and makes an apt comparison with Horace's <i>pulvis et umbra sumus</i> (&#145;we are dust and a shade&#146;; <span class="italic">Odes</span>, iv.7.16). Such a comparison, however, would occur to most moderately well-read eighteenth-century gentlemen.<br>
<br>Fawkes's 1761 poetic collection includes a number of interesting translations from modern Latin authors, emphasizing the importance of this literary genre in the eighteenth century, especially among university poets, and its close connection with poetry in the vernacular. He translated Cambridge tripos verses by Christopher Smart, and by &#145;my worthy friend and former tutor, the Rev. Richard Oakley&#146;  (Fawkes, <span class="italic">Original Poems</span>, 174). He also chose to translate a Latin poem by the Italian Renaissance writer Hieronymus Amaltheus, and several humorous Latin pieces by Vincent Bourne, one of the period's most successful writers of light verse; one of these&#151;&#145;Doron Adoron&#146; [a gift but no gift], &#145;Thank you for nothing&#146;  (ibid., 132)&#151;reveals a timeless secret of the innkeeper's art, the provision of thirst-inducing salty snacks. Some of Fawkes's light verse achieved success; his song &#145;The Brown Jug&#146; became remarkably popular. Fawkes engaged in some literary hack work, as well as lending his name to notes in <span class="italic">The Complete Family Bible</span> (1761). He collaborated with William Woty on <span class="italic">The Poetical Calendar</span> (12 vols., 1763), and <span class="italic">The Poetical Magazine, or, The Muses' Monthly Companion</span> (1764). The &#145;Muses&#146; stayed together for a mere six issues. Fawkes turned to the popular genre of the modern eclogue, a fitting combination of classical and polite learning, and wrote on partridge shooting. No doubt he also consumed the fruits of his literary labours.<br>
<br>In his lifetime, Fawkes's reputation as a translator was high. He enjoyed the friendship and occasional collaboration of other literary figures, including Samuel Johnson and John Jortin, who both shared his affection for ancient and modern Latin. Though later critics have paid less attention, his works were reprinted in the nineteenth century, and five extracts from his translations of Greek poets were selected in 1995 for <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Classical Verse</span> (ed. Poole and Maule), where they stand up well in some impressive company.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Fawkes was working on a translation of the Hellenistic epic poet Apollonius of Rhodes, but his &#145;dilatoriness and love of ease&#146; prevented its appearance before his death. Fawkes died on 26 August 1777; his library was sold in the following year. His widow had been left with little else; her need for the subscription income encouraged the completion and prompt publication of his unfinished Apollonius in 1780. His &#145;coadjutor and editor&#146;, Mr Meen of Emmanuel, praised Fawkes's earlier work: his Anacreon and Theocritus are &#145;acknowledged to have considerable merit&#146;  (Fawkes and Meen, xv), and to the end of his life he could handle the heroic couplet with impressive facility.<br>
