<span class="headword">Sheehan,  John</span>  (1809&#150;1882), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was the son of Thomas Sheehan, a grazier, and Alicia Dunn of Celbridge, co. Kildare. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College, where he was taught by Francis Sylvester Mahony, better known as Father Prout. In October 1829 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, but he did not graduate. In 1830 he joined the Comet Club, a literary society with members including Samuel Lover, Joseph Stirling Coyne, Robert Knox, subsequently editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, and Maurice O'Connell, son of Daniel O'Connell. At first its members prepared and issued pamphlets attacking the tithe system; the first, <span class="italic">The Parson's Horn Book</span>, which appeared in two parts with etchings by Lover, met with extraordinary success. According to Sheehan it had a greater circulation and caused more sensation than any book issued in Ireland since the days of Swift. The club then issued <span class="italic">The Comet</span>, a satirical weekly paper which attacked the Church of Ireland, the first number appearing on 1 May 1831. Sheehan was appointed sub-editor. In a few weeks it had reached a circulation of many thousand copies, and until it ceased at the end of 1833 exercised considerable influence. In the autumn of 1833 the government ordered the arrest of the editor, Thomas Browne, and Sheehan for libel. They were defended by Daniel O'Connell and Robert Holmes, but were each sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of &pound;100. The fine was, however, remitted, and the term of imprisonment was only partly served.<br>
<br>Sheehan, on his release, studied for the Irish bar, to which he was called in 1835. He shortly afterwards came to London, where he became a journalist, and in 1836 he was in Paris and Madrid as representative of <span class="italic">The Constitutional</span> newspaper. He next became parliamentary reporter of the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, and contributed poems and sketches to <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> and other magazines. In March 1839 he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, but he did not graduate. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1841 and called to the English bar in 1846. He had been admitted to the King's Inns in 1843, but seems never to have practised. In 1852 he was proprietor and editor of <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, published in London and Cambridge. As a young man in Paris in the 1830s Thackeray knew Sheehan well, and he is believed to be the original of Captain Shandon in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>.<br>
<br>Shortly after 1868 Sheehan married the widow of Colonel Shubrick, a wealthy Anglo-Indian officer, and spent some years in travelling about the continent. He eventually retired to the Charterhouse, where he died on 29 May 1882.<br>
