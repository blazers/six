</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parkinson,  Frank</span>  (1887&#150;1946), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and philanthropist</span>, was born at Springfield, Guiseley, Wharfedale, Yorkshire, on 7 February 1887, the eldest of three children of Joseph Parkinson (1862&#150;1902), stone mason and quarry-owner, and his wife, Ann Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yeadon (<i>b</i>. 1861). Educated at Guiseley Wesleyan day school, he took evening classes at the Guiseley Mechanics' Institute and, during 1903&#150;4, evening lectures in electrical engineering at the University of Leeds on a Baines scholarship. Apprenticed at fourteen to Rhodes Motors, manufacturing electrical engineers, of Bradford and later Doncaster, he rose to works manager by nineteen. At twenty-one he started &#145;F. Parkinson &amp; Co, electric power engineers&#146;, committing all his &pound;21 Post Office savings, but he safeguarded family assets by conveying property inherited on his father's death (1902) to his mother, and laying the basis for a classic business creation myth. His origins were thus modest but far from poor.<br>
<br>Parkinson moved into manufacturing alternating-current motors with his brother in 1913, as F. and A. Parkinson. This was a union of complementary skills: Frank had a brilliant commercial brain and dominant personality while Albert proved a master of precision production engineering. They converted to limited liability and moved to new custom-built premises in 1916. The factory was organized on flow production methods and layout, unique for British industry at the time, providing significant gains in costs and quality. By 1920 they had an established reputation, and by adopting ball and roller bearings set the industry standard. Their culture of standardization and systematic production was adopted to match foreign competition, and by 1927 they claimed the Guiseley works as &#145;the most efficient factory in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Foundations</span>, 50).<br>
<br>Guiseley was the focus of Frank Parkinson's life until the later 1920s. He married Gertrude Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), daughter of George Hull, retired station master, on 21 May 1912. His only child, Arthur, was born in 1915. From 1918 he lived at Greenlaw, a substantial farmhouse with 1&frac12; acres of land, and built up a dairy farm around Upcroft House, with 28 acres of pasture. He was a very active, even domineering trustee of Guiseley Trinity Wesleyan Chapel, applying sound business principles to introduce &#145;systematic contributions&#146; and raise insurance cover.<br>
<br>Fundamental change came with a friend's remark on a bus at the Institution of Electrical Engineers meeting in Nottingham, that Crompton &amp; Co. of Chelmsford had financial problems, and was underperforming in the keen competitive conditions of the 1920s. The outcome was merger in 1927, with Frank Parkinson as chairman. He brought the founder, Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton, who had been excluded in a boardroom coup in 1912, back onto the board as symbol of continuity, and cultivated his friendship, fly fishing with him at Azerley Chase (near Ripon), and showing him the Guiseley factory and farm.<br>
<br>Between 1927 and 1937 the new Crompton Parkinson Ltd showed spectacular growth. Parkinson's strategy was one of focused manufacturing, acquisitions, strong profit performance, full employment of capacity, and high liquidity. Capital growth was more significant than share yields, making the company relatively unattractive for the investor seeking income. There was a &#145;meteoric rise&#146; in profits between 1928 and 1938, from &pound;89,110 to &pound;432,114, and dividends typically exceeded 12.5 per cent cash plus 7 per cent capital bonus. British Electric Transformer Co. Ltd, with Kye Lamps of Edmonton and Tricity Cookers, and Derby Cables were acquired in 1932; Atlas Sprinkler, Young Accumulator, and Associated Electric Vehicles had been added by 1941. Group output thus extended to cables, domestic cookers, starter motors, and batteries, linking the firm to two leading growth sectors, cars and &#145;white goods&#146;. Manufacturing subsidiaries were established at Bombay and Sydney, with some high-profile power engineering, such as the electrification of the ice-plant at Fleetwood in 1932. By 1946, it had a leading position in battery-powered urban vehicles (a joint venture with Austin) and its motors were in trams, trolleybuses and diesel&#150;electric locomotives. From 1932 the lamp business developed with the marketing of the &#145;one-shilling lamp&#146;, successfully challenging from 1935 the &#145;Lamp Ring&#146;, the manufacturing cartel established in 1919, and gaining admission to its membership in 1937. The new Guiseley factory opened in 1938. By 1933 the firm considered a bid for the underperforming giant, English Electric, forcing GEC and Associated Electrical Industries to make pre-emptive responses, and it explored another asymmetric merger with Callender Cable in 1938. The Guiseley minnow had joined the big fish in twenty years.<br>
<br>Outstanding manufacturing prowess was accompanied by an inclusive but controlling paternalism in management. Sports and social clubs were run for employees, with inter-plant cup competitions. Employee shares were allotted by directors on a discretionary basis from 1918, and continued after 1927; a superannuation scheme was established in 1926; and a central benevolent fund in 1935. Self-development was encouraged, training emphasized and supported by bursaries, and employee engagement and succession planning was promoted by the creation of a junior board in 1943, designed to open the door to talent and develop the &#145;democratic principle of selection and government&#146;  (Stokoe correspondence, Sci. Mus. library, CRO 7/7, 7).<br>
<br>The merger of 1927 shifted Parkinson's centre of gravity southward: Bush House, Aldwych, became his base, and remarriage confirmed his relocation. Shortly after his first marriage ended in divorce (15 January 1936), he married, on 21 January 1936, Doris Burke (<i>b</i>. 1895/6) of Grosvenor Square. She was the divorced wife of Alfred George Burke, and was the daughter of John William Macduff. World travel and the London scene distanced him from his brother. From 1936 he settled at a country house, Charters, at Sunninghill, Berkshire, having purchased and demolished the Victorian house of that name to make a major statement in the landscape at a cost of &pound;160,000. Built of brick in modern style, it was faced with Portland stone, with a six-column portico lighting a two-storied central hall on the south front. It recalled the university building that was later to bear his name. Internally, it had painted walls in the reception rooms, and modernism in the bedrooms, with craftsman-built furniture throughout. Its services were also modern, befitting the engineer owner: it had air-conditioning, electrically operated curtains, and England's first domestic dishwasher. It was &#145;a machine to live in&#146;. It sat in mature parkland, echoing classic country houses, and had a model dairy farm to reinforce the comparison. Life there aped the house party. A weary weekend guest recalled the rigours of a typical day in the hands of a &#145;man of energy&#146;: two sets of tennis preceded breakfast; there were rounds of golf at Sunningdale on either side of lunch; bridge before dinner; and a trip to a London show at night. As host, Parkinson was both indefatigable and inexhaustible.<br>
<br>At the same time Parkinson built up an estate of 3000 acres at West Tisted, Hampshire, and applied Parkinsonian principles: model dairying, with detailed monitoring to produce grade A milk; grass-drying and silage; new buildings with a Danish piggery; and student visits (from the University of Reading) encouraged. Worth around &pound;100,000, it endowed the Frank Parkinson Agricultural Trust established in 1943, but remained a potential drain under lesser management. Effective charitable work&#151;&#145;for the improvement and welfare of British agriculture&#146;&#151;began only with the sale of the farms in the mid-1950s.<br>
<br>Parkinson also used a considerable portion of his wealth to thank the University of Leeds. In 1936 he covenanted &pound;50,000 to Leeds for Parkinson scholarships, followed in 1937 by &pound;200,000 to finance the building of the &#145;block&#146; for the university, already in outline design from 1926, an entrance to make an &#145;indelible impression&#146; on future students. There were nervous moments over project management and design details, where he wanted marble columns for parity with Lord Brotherton's library. He sensed ingratitude when the university queried running costs. The shell of the building was used by the Ministry of Food in the war, but Parkinson did not see its completion: the tower was finished in 1949, and the Parkinson Building formally opened, by the chancellor, the princess royal, in 1951. A modest gift was also made in 1938 to the Newnham College, Cambridge, building fund.<br>
<br>Parkinson left the chairmanship of Crompton Parkinson in March 1941 to work full-time as deputy director-general of contracts at the Ministry of Supply, but remained on the board. By then his health was failing, and he died of a heart attack at Charters on 28 January 1946. Cremated at Woking on 1 February, with a memorial service at St Margaret's, Westminster, his funeral was at Guiseley Trinity Methodist Chapel, and his ashes interred in the parish church. He left &pound;1,487,285, with the farm effects and &pound;10,000 bequeathed to the Agricultural Trust. After family bequests, the residue funded the Frank Parkinson Yorkshire Trust (established 1950), which built the Frank Parkinson Homes for the elderly in Guiseley, initially six (1953) with a further twenty-four in 1965.<br>
<br>&#145;Britain's (and Yorkshire's) &#147;shyest millionaire&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>) was a complex mix: private but cultivating reputation; acquisitive and charitable; a dominant personality, at once charming and unapproachable; and fiercely competitive with great entrepreneurial talent. Even his Guiseley relatives felt they did not know him well. Inspired by a sense of destiny, he left enduring monuments to a remarkable business career in the two trusts and the university building.<br>
