<span class="headword">Ayton,  William Alexander</span>  (1816&#150;1909), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and alchemist</span>, was born on 28 April 1816 in the Bloomsbury district of London, the son of William Capon Ayton. He was educated at the Charterhouse School, London, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1841. In the same year he took holy orders and he was ordained priest the following year. From 1850 to 1873 he held a series of rural livings in the midlands, and was then appointed vicar of Chacombe, Northamptonshire, where he remained until his retirement in 1894.<br>
<br>Ayton took up occult pursuits while at Cambridge but did not develop them extensively until the 1880s, when an unhappy involvement with the spurious Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor in 1884 was followed by a significant role in the affairs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which he and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1898), joined in July 1888; he took as his motto within the order &#145;Virtute orta occidunt rarius&#146; (&#145;those that rise by virtue rarely fall&#146;), and his wife's was &#145;Quam potera adjutato&#146; (&#145;I will help as much as I can&#146;). In 1890 he conducted the marriage of Samuel Liddell Mathers (1854&#150;1918), a founder of the order, and Mina Bergson at Chacombe, and following the collapse of the order in 1901 he acted as co-chief of its rump with A. E. Waite until his death.<br>
<br>Alchemy, however, was Ayton's great passion, his experiments being conducted largely in an alchemical laboratory that he had built in his cellar at Chacombe, &#145;where the Bishop cannot see it&#146;  (Yeats, 184). His letters reveal a profound knowledge of alchemical texts but he was very much a practising alchemist and claimed to have perfected the elixir of life, albeit fruitlessly: he told W. B. Yeats that he had &#145;put it away on a shelf &hellip; but when I got it down the other day it had all dried up&#146;  (ibid.). Ayton's final years, until his death at home at the age of ninety-two, on 1 January 1909, were spent at Grove Lodge, Saffron Walden, where he continued to warn of the dangers inherent in occultism while still encouraging others, such as Julius Kohn, the translator of many classical alchemical texts, in their own occult researches.<br>
