<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hopkinson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Botting]</span>,  Eirene Adeline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Antonia White]</span>  (1899&#150;1980), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 31 March 1899 at 22 Perham Road, West Kensington, London, the only child of Cecil George Botting (1870&#150;1929), classics master at St Paul's School, London, and his wife, Christine Julia Barbour White (1871&#150;1939), governess, daughter of Henry and Clementina White. She disliked her name and was known for most of her professional life as Antonia White. Her father, a gifted but rigid man, dominated her childhood, and she would blame him for her terrifying emotional problems. In 1906 the family was converted to Roman Catholicism, and Antonia boarded at the Sacred Heart Convent, Roehampton, London (1908&#150;14), the experience on which she based her famous novel <span class="italic">Frost in May</span>. She wrote: &#145;I sometimes wish I'd never been brought into and up in the Catholic religion &hellip; but I can no more escape from it all than I can restore the lenses to my eyes or straighten my broken finger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries, 1958&#150;1979</span>, 11 June 1971). She was removed from school after the nuns found a &#145;scandalous&#146; novel she had been writing, and this event came to symbolize the struggle between her wish to please her father and the church, and her yearning for a life of art and freedom.<br>
<br>Distancing herself from Cecil Botting's values, Antonia worked from the age of sixteen as a governess, clerk, and actress, and earned a good income from writing advertisements and newspaper fiction. But though this writing came easily, she found serious creative work a lifelong problem. On 28 April 1921 she married Reginald Henry (Reggie) Green-Wilkinson (<i>b</i>. 1899), a part-time actor and a secretary for Anglo Continental film studios, but the marriage was annulled owing to non-consummation. This led to a breakdown, and in November 1922 she was committed for nine months to Bethlem Hospital, London, where she suffered hallucinations and was forcibly fed. Although she was not certified again, the possibility of mental illness haunted her for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>On 15 April 1925 Antonia married Eric Earnshaw Smith (1893&#150;1972), a civil servant, with whom she had a deep platonic friendship. The marriage was permitted by the church, but within a year she had lapsed as a Catholic. As she later wrote, &#145;The general climate of the 1920s, the scepticism, the almost idolatrous devotion to art got under my skin&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hound and the Falcon</span>, 155). She worked in Crawford's advertising agency, mixed with painters and writers, and soon began to look for a more normal relationship. She was now an attractive and sophisticated woman, nothing like the girlish heroine of her novels, and had several lovers. Eventually she sought a second annulment to marry Rudolph (Silas) Glossop (1902&#150;1993), a mining engineer who was the father of her daughter, the writer Susan Chitty (<i>b</i>. 1929). But instead she married, on 28 November 1930, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40160/', "(Henry) Thomas (Tom) Hopkinson (1905&#150;1990)")</script>, the future editor of <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>. They had a daughter, Lyndall, born in 1931.<br>
<br>Antonia continued to work in women's journalism and on the fringes of the London literary world. She was quite undomestic; her children were looked after by a nurse. Her husband encouraged her to write and in 1933 she produced her best-known novel, <span class="italic">Frost in May</span>. This has been acclaimed ever since as the classic account of a Catholic education: a female, more accessible equivalent to James Joyce's <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist</span>. But, as she complained long afterwards, &#145;it hangs round my neck like a withered wreath&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries, 1926&#150;1957</span>, 16 Aug 1954). She could not follow up her success because her marriage was crumbling, owing to Tom's infidelity and her fears that she was again becoming mad. In 1935 she left home, became involved with various younger men, and submitted to a long course of Freudian analysis which, she felt, enabled her to stay out of asylums. She and Tom Hopkinson were divorced in 1938. She had a difficult relationship with her daughters, who lived with her only part-time. Both later wrote memoirs of her.<br>
<br>Antonia remained in London throughout the war, working for the BBC and later the Special Operations Executive. Her letters (1940&#150;41) to the Catholic intellectual Peter Thorp were eventually published as <span class="italic">The Hound and the Falcon</span> (1965). Although troubled by &#145;the Church's rigorously repressive attitude towards so much in contemporary thought and opinion&#146;  (&#145;Foreword&#146; to <span class="italic">The Hound and the Falcon</span>), she started to practise her religion again. Although she had no more affairs, it remained a love&#150;hate relationship.<br>
<br>In 1950 Antonia published <span class="italic">The Lost Traveller</span>, which continues the story of the Antonia-figure, now called Clara, into adulthood. But it was nothing like as good as <span class="italic">Frost in May</span>, and the reviewers said so. It was followed by two better novels, <span class="italic">The Sugar House</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Beyond the Glass</span> (1954), dealing with her first marriage and breakdown. She tried for many years to complete Clara's story, but was never able to get much beyond her release from Bethlem in 1923. A collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Strangers</span> (1954), also contains some striking work.<br>
<br>The last twenty-five years of Antonia's life were the calmest, though she was still distressed by religious doubts, money problems, and her writer's block. She lived in Kensington, alone except for her cats, who inspired two charming children's books, and supported herself by translating over thirty novels from French. The beginnings of another &#145;Clara&#146; novel and an autobiography were published in <span class="italic">As Once in May</span> (1983), edited by Susan Chitty. In 1978, after years of neglect, <span class="italic">Frost in May</span> was reprinted as the first <span class="roman">Virago Modern Classic</span>. The three sequels followed and she was applauded as one of the very few writers who could transmute personal experience into literature. She died of cancer on 10 April 1980 at St Raphael's Nursing Home, Danehill, Sussex, and therefore did not live to see her novels dramatized on BBC television in 1981. She was buried in the Catholic cemetery at West Grinstead, Sussex, close to where her father's family had lived for generations.<br>
