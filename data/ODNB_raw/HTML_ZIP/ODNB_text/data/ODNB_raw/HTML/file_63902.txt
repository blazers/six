<span class="headword">Yates <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Janau]</span>,  Rose Emma Lamartine</span>  (1875&#150;1954), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 23 February 1875 at 33 Dalyell Road, Lambeth, London, the youngest daughter of the three children of Marie Elphege Bertoni Victor Janau (<i>b</i>. 1847), teacher of foreign languages, and his wife, Marie Pauline (1841&#150;1909). Both her parents were born in France and became naturalized British subjects. Yates was schooled privately in Truro, Cornwall. Her education continued at Royal Holloway College and the University of Oxford, where she studied modern languages and philology. In 1900 she married Thomas Lamartine Yates (1849&#150;1929), a solicitor, and eight years later gave birth to their only child, Paul. Both were passionate cyclists, touring Europe in the early years of their marriage, and were active members of the Cyclists' Touring Club. Within the club Yates was a leading figure in the reform party and in 1908 was the first woman elected to its council. She resigned her seat in 1915.<br>
<br>Yates's involvement with the women's suffrage campaign, in which her husband supported her, began in 1909. On 24 February she was arrested while on a deputation to the House of Commons. At her trial, where she was sentenced to one month's imprisonment in Holloway gaol, she made an impassioned defence of her actions: &#145;every woman must have the courage of her convictions, and not slink back when she has taken her first step&#146;  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 5 March 1909, 407). It was a sentiment that informed Yates's life. By 1910 she was honorary secretary of the Wimbledon Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and under her leadership it became one of the most prosperous branches in the organization. Between 1910 and 1914 she addressed meetings across London and nationally, notably delivering a speech at the 1910 massive demonstration in Hyde Park. Throughout this period she was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Wimbledon Borough News</span>, where she made regular propaganda for the cause. Yates made little distinction between her private and public worlds. Her house&#151;Dorset Hall in Merton&#151;was both home and refuge: suffragettes convalesced there after periods of imprisonment. Even her enthusiasm for gardening&#151;she was a member of the Royal Horticultural Society&#151;was utilized for the cause. She planted a section of her garden in WSPU colours.<br>
<br>Yates was a committed member of the union, though not an uncritical follower. Her political sympathies lay with the left of the movement and she shared friendships with socialist suffragettes Mary Gawthorpe, Elinor Penn Gaskell, and Emily Wilding Davison&#151;an old college friend. Her open dissent was provoked by the decision to suspend militant activity at the outbreak of the First World War. She saw no reason for campaigning to stop, and objected to the transformation of the union into a pro-war organization. In October 1915 Yates chaired a meeting protesting against using the union's name for non-suffrage activity and a year later supported the formation of &#145;Suffragettes of the WSPU&#146;. Although linked with the left, it seems that Yates never joined a political party. In 1919 she contested, as an independent, the London county council seat of North Lambeth. Elected on a reform programme, she spent three years championing equal pay, increased public housing, and the provision of nursery education.<br>
<br>Yates was instrumental in building an archive of the suffrage campaign, and in 1939 opened the Women's Record House in Great Smith Square, London. The premises were destroyed during the Second World War. Some of its records were rescued and form part of the Suffragette Fellowship collection in the Museum of London.<br>
<br>Yates died of colon cancer on 5 November 1954, at her home, 11 Bede House, Manor Fields, Wandsworth, London. She was survived by her son.<br>
