<span class="headword">Hastings,  Henry</span>, fifth earl of Huntingdon  (1586&#150;1643), <span class="occ">nobleman and landowner</span>, was born on 24 April 1586 at Exton, Rutland, the eldest son of Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings (1560&#150;1595), heir apparent to the earldom of Huntingdon, and Sarah, daughter of Sir James Harrington, of Exton. As a boy he was described as &#145;low in stature, but of comely countenance and lively wit&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 164). He was educated under the direction of his great-uncle, the third earl, by a &#145;learned and godly schoolmaster&#146;, probably Nathaniel Gilby, the earl's chaplain. His Latin exercises suggest a curriculum parallel to that established by the third earl for Leicester grammar school. Later he was entered at Gray's Inn and at Queens' College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1601. This education endowed the fifth earl with sense of his lineage, the importance of honour, and a deep-seated religious conviction. Although his uncle the puritan Sir Francis Hastings congratulated the new earl for &#145;resolving religiously&#146; on &#145;the godly government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 98) of his household, and although religiosity shapes his patronage (he continued to support Arthur Hildersham into the 1620s), Huntingdon's own religious attitudes were moderately protestant.<br>
<br>From 1595 to 1604 Hastings was styled Lord Hastings, inheriting the earldom from his grandfather George Hastings, fourth earl of Huntingdon, in 1604. As a minor he succeeded to some local family offices such as keeper of the royal forest of Leicester, but not to the lord lieutenancy of Leicestershire which he regained in 1607, retaining the office until his death; he was lord lieutenant of Rutland from 1614 to 1642. He married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40549/', "Lady Elizabeth Hastings, n&#233;e Stanley (bap. 1587, d. 1633)")</script>, one of the coheirs of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26269/', "Ferdinando Stanley, fifth earl of Derby")</script>, on 15 January 1601 at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. The couple had four children: Alice (<i>b</i>. 1606), Ferdinando (<i>b</i>. 1608), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12576/', "Henry Hastings, Baron Loughborough (1610&#150;1667)")</script>, and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1612).<br>
<br>Huntingdon inherited an impoverished estate which curtailed his activities and he lamented how &#145;without meanes honour look[s] as naked as Trees that are cropped&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings papers, HAP 15/8). Even with his wife's &pound;4000 dowry he faced catastrophe. It was estimated that the third earl had sold lands worth &pound;90,000 and the fourth earl alienated further lands, reducing his annual income in 1604 to just over &pound;37. The estate, encumbered with two dowagers, was so bereft of cash that no money existed in 1604 to cover immediate expenses and creditors, including the exchequer, threatened land seizures. Further land sales commenced and the countess's jointure was renegotiated. By 1622 the deficit had fallen to &pound;11,662 and Huntingdon's income stabilized at about &pound;2032 although after his costs and repayments the remaining &pound;900 failed to match his annual expenditure of about &pound;1400. Vigorous measures such as the collection of arrears, deforestation, coalmining, personal borrowing, the dowry from his future daughter-in-law, and even payments from lawsuits (he gained &pound;2506 from the Fawnt case in 1639) barely kept the earl afloat.<br>
<br>Impoverishment appears to have limited Huntingdon's participation in national politics, although he was associated with the earls of Southampton and Pembroke and supported the Bohemian war as part of the pro war patriot faction on his occasional parliamentary appearances. A portrait even existed of him holding the petition of right. Interestingly, he did remain involved with the Virginia Company, and was elected to its council for his efforts in finding settlers, although he was perhaps motivated by the hope of riches as his letters to his agent, Captain Martiau, illustrate. His most distinctive contribution lay in local governance and as lord lieutenant and <i>custos rotulorum</i> Huntingdon used his expanded powers to dominate the local &eacute;lite and, in general, even ensured the collection of extra-parliamentary levies. Much of this local power was directed towards sustaining his familial position and the continued feud with the Greys of Groby. His two famous lawsuits, against Shirley and Fawnt, are both products of this feud, although in the late 1630s Huntingdon found himself employed by central government, perhaps precisely because of his &#145;quasi-feudal paternalism&#146; and rigorous county governance. Thus, although of little significance in national politics, Huntingdon's career has been studied for the detailed information it provides about aristocratic attitudes and the interaction of local politics and central government in the 1620s and 1630s. Huntingdon wrote extensively, including &#145;The directions&#146; (a compendium of his views for his son Ferdinando), household ordinances, directions on the etiquette of gift-giving, travel journals, and numerous notes on honour, his family history, religion, and aristocratic precedent and privilege. It is precisely the lack of originality of these works that renders them a valuable source.<br>
<br>Within his financial limits Huntingdon patronized the arts, and was interested in gardening and architecture. His most singular act of literary patronage was the performance of John Marston's <span class="italic">Entertainment at Ashby</span> (August 1607, with additions by Sir William Skipwith), celebrating the arrival of his mother-in-law, the dowager countess of Derby, and Huntingdon's own coming of age. During his lifetime eight books were dedicated to him, largely by authors associated with his family estates, or recipients of his family's educational and clerical patronage, although he also amassed a substantial library. Significantly, these books from Leicestershire authors were often printed by Samuel Macham, a printer from Ashby who worked from the Bull's Head (the Huntingdon device) in St Paul's Churchyard and who acted as Huntingdon's agent in London.<br>
<br>Faced with a limited material patrimony and an extensive spiritual and aristocratic lineage, Huntingdon fostered his local roots in order to sustain his dignity. He relied on the rigorous exercise of local and hereditary offices, extensive hospitality, the cultivation of county and familial networks, and the judicious use of ecclesiastical, educational, and other notably cost-effective means of patronage to represent his status and views. Until the 1630s he cultivated a deliberately non-court oriented position and an ascetic protestantism that translated poverty into virtue. Indeed, Huntingdon is summed up by his motto <i>Honorantes me honorabo</i> which, according to his grandson, showed his &#145;true sense of religion&#146;, the motto &#145;intimating that those only should be esteemed by him who did faithfully honour God&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 78, fol. 410). He died at Ashby-de-la-Zouch on 14 November 1643 and was buried there on 16 December. Ferdinando succeeded to the title as sixth earl of Huntingdon.<br>
