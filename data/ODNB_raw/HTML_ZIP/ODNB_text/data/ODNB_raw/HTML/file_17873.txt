<span class="headword">Malebisse <span class="st"> [Malebysse]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1155&#150;1209/10), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the eldest son of William of Acaster Malbisse, whom he succeeded in 1176, and Emma, the illegitimate daughter of William de Percy. His only tenancy-in-chief was a single fee of the honour of Eye, but he was nevertheless a considerable landholder in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, who in 1198 founded the Premonstratensian abbey of Newbo, Lincolnshire, and was a benefactor of other religious houses, notably Fountains Abbey. He acted as a royal justice at Northampton in 1183, and seems to have kept the forest at Galtres in Yorkshire under Henry II. The keepership was confirmed (in return for a large sum) by Richard I. However, indebtedness to the king, arising in part from participation in royal administration and in part from litigiousness, forced him to borrow, and by 1182 at the latest he was heavily indebted to Aaron of Lincoln. Malebisse's leading role in the massacre of the Jews in York in 1190 made him infamous, even in his own lifetime. The chronicler William of Newburgh thought his name &#145;Mala-Bestia&#146; peculiarly apposite. He makes it clear that the massacre was instigated not by the citizens of York, but by a <i>conjuratio</i> of indebted local landholders, who capitalized on popular antisemitic fervour, whipped up by the preaching of the third crusade, as a means of extinguishing their debts. At the climax of the pogrom the <i>conjurati</i> marched on York Minster and burned the Jewish bonds&#151;lodged there for safekeeping&#151;in the middle of the church. Thereby they sought to achieve &#145;liberation for themselves and many others&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, 321&#150;2).<br>
<br>Malebisse might have liberated himself from debts to the Jewish moneylenders of York, but in doing so he had fettered himself anew. He forfeited his lands for his part in the pogrom, and was allowed to resume them, pending the return of the king, only in return for a fine of 20 marks. He compounded his difficulties by supporting Count John, the king's brother, first against the chancellor, William de Longchamp, for which he was excommunicated in December 1191, and then in open revolt against the king in 1193&#150;4. On Richard I's return to England in 1194 Malebisse had to proffer 300 marks to recover the king's goodwill, and Richard seems to have kept him on a short leash of debt for the rest of his reign. On John's accession Malebisse sought to call in the new king's debt to him: he proffered a substantial fine to recover full seisin of what he had lost through his participation in what the chancery clerk delicately termed &#145;our service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pipe rolls</span>, 2 John, 110). He had managed to retain his keepership of the forest during Richard's reign, but he now began to play a fuller part in royal government, as an assessor of tallage, a justice itinerant in several midland shires during the 1201&#150;3 visitation, and a member of John's embassy to William the Lion in 1201. But when he secured permission to fortify his residence at Wheldrake, near York, the citizens of York persuaded the sheriff to intervene with the king and stop the work.<br>
<br>At the same time Malebisse was again finding that fuller participation in royal government could be just as expensive as exclusion. By 1204 he was proffering &pound;100 to recover seisin of lands and chattels taken into the king's hand because of reports that he had kept the forest at Galtres badly. An inquest found that, among other offences, he had taken 250 of the king's oaks to fortify his aborted castle at Wheldrake. He had been caught with his hand in the till, and his administrative career came to another halt. Even his keepership of the forest was not restored to him. By this time he was again in debt to Jewish financiers: so much so that in 1205 the king instructed the sheriff of Yorkshire to grant him respite from his Jewish debts &#145;for as long as he remains in debt to us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rotuli litterarum clausarum</span>, 1.58). Ever resourceful, he managed to extract himself from this debt within three years, perhaps by dint of arranging a second marriage for his daughter Emma, widow of Robert de Meisnil, to Robert de Stuteville of Great Ayton, probably a younger son of Robert (IV) de Stuteville (<i>d</i>. 1205), lord of Knaresborough. Stuteville thereby secured Emma's valuable dower, and doubtless made an appropriate expression of his gratitude to Malebisse, who had to pay heavily for royal permission for the marriage. By 1210 Malebisse was dead, for his elder son, John, owed a relief of 300 marks. Little is known of his wife, Helewise, and his second son, Richard.<br>
