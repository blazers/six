<span class="headword">Whitelaw,  James Hunter</span>  (1936&#150;2006), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 28 January 1936 at 87 Stewart Crescent, Newmains, near Wishaw, Lanarkshire, the only child of James Whitelaw, a clerk in an ironworks, later an accountant and manager with the National Coal Board, and his wife, Jean Ross, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott. He was educated at Glasgow high school and Glasgow University, where he followed a sandwich course in mechanical engineering with industrial placements in the UK and Bahrain. Shortly after his return from Bahrain he met Elizabeth (Elspeth) Shields (<i>b</i>. 1935), a schoolteacher, and daughter of David Dewar Williamson Shields. They married on 10 July 1959 at Cardonald church, Glasgow, and had three sons, Alan (<i>b</i>. 1962), Stuart (<i>b</i>. 1964), and Jamie (<i>b</i>. 1968).<br>
<br>Following the completion of his undergraduate studies in 1957 and a brief period with Rolls-Royce as a graduate trainee, Whitelaw returned to Glasgow University to pursue doctoral studies on the thermo-physical properties of gases, for which he was awarded his PhD in 1961. He subsequently continued his research as a Fulbright scholar under the supervision of Joseph Kestin at Brown University, Rhode Island, in 1961&#150;3. The guidance provided by Kestin was a lasting influence. Whitelaw returned to the UK in 1963 as a lecturer in the mechanical engineering department of Imperial College, led by Owen Saunders, to work in the thermodynamics and fluid mechanics division headed by Brian Spalding. The focus of the group's activities was on the development and application of &#145;universal&#146; calculation methods for turbulent flows. The advent of such computational methods required experimental confirmation, and Whitelaw's groundbreaking research resulted in the development and application of non-intrusive laser-based instrumentation for flow characterization.<br>
<br>The early helium-neon lasers were highly unstable in operation, and difficulties in aligning the different optical components made progress slow. A key development, pursued jointly by Whitelaw and his research assistant, Franz Durst, resulted in a compact integrated system that formed the basis for subsequent commercial instruments. Further contributions were made in the area of counter-type processors and in the treatment of data through time-averaging. Together with Adrian Melling, Whitelaw and Durst wrote the first, highly influential book on the subject of laser Doppler anemometry (a technique for measuring the direction and speed of fluids). The experimental techniques developed under Whitelaw's charismatic leadership found wide application, for example in the study of the dynamics of combustion processes in furnaces and engines. Whitelaw's main research goal was to reveal the nature of aerodynamic and thermo-physical processes rather than simply to develop instrumentation. His research covered fundamental topics, like the anisotropy of turbulent stresses and the extinction/re-ignition of turbulent flames, as well as practical devices, including complex industrial burners, automotive engines, and gas turbines. Further developments followed, such as the phase-Doppler anemometer (PDA) for spray research and the shadow-Doppler anemometer for irregular particles, the latter in collaboration with colleagues at Keio University in Japan. During thirty-six years at Imperial Whitelaw published over 300 research papers and successfully supervised eighty-six PhD students. In addition, with colleagues from around the world, he organized a series of symposia on the application of laser-based methods to fluid mechanics at the Gulbenkian Institute in Lisbon. With Wolfgang Merzkirch he launched the archival journal <span class="italic">Experiments in Fluids</span> in 1981, and served as editor from 1983 to 1999.<br>
<br>Whitelaw advanced rapidly at Imperial College, becoming reader in 1969 and professor of convective heat transfer in 1974. He held the position of deputy head of department and was head of the thermofluids section for twenty-five years. He also developed close links with colleagues at overseas institutions and held visiting professorships at the universities of Arizona, California at Berkeley, and Minnesota, and at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He received honorary degrees from the Technical University of Lisbon (1980), the Polytechnic University of Valencia (1996), Trinity College, Dublin (1999), and the National Technical University of Athens (2001). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (1991), a fellow of the Royal Society (1996), a fellow of the City and Guilds Institute (1998), and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Engineering (2000).<br>
<br>Whitelaw's enthusiasm for life and research was evident to the very end of his typically determined and dignified battle against the advance of motor neurone disease, during which he was fully supported by his wife, Elspeth, and their three sons. He died on 16 August 2006 at his home in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey.<br>
