</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gonne,  (Edith) Maud</span>  (1866&#150;1953), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 21 December 1866 at Tongham Manor, near Farnham, Surrey, eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Gonne (1835&#150;1886) of the 17th lancers and his wife, Edith Frith Cook (1844&#150;1871), daughter of William Cook, merchant, and Margaretta Cockayne Frith. In April 1868 Thomas Gonne was appointed cavalry brigade major in Ireland and was stationed at Curragh Camp, co. Kildare. Maud's sister Kathleen Gonne (<i>d</i>. 1919) was born in September 1868. Edith Gonne, suffering from tuberculosis, gave birth in London to her third child, Margaretta, in June 1871, and died on the twenty first of that month; Margaretta died on 9 August. The trauma affected Maud Gonne deeply. She recalled that her father had said, as he showed her Edith's coffin, that she must not fear anything, not even death.<br>
<br>The family returned to Ireland and the children and their nurse were moved to a cottage at Howth, a beautiful promontory north of Dublin, which remained a sacred place for Maud Gonne. Thomas Gonne was recalled by Maud Gonne as &#145;Tommy&#146;, an ideal father, and his enchanting letters to &#145;Lamb&#146; (Maud) and &#145;Bear&#146; (Kathleen) fully support this. In 1876 Major Gonne was appointed military attach&eacute; to the Austrian court and the family left Ireland. The children were brought up by a nurse&#150;housekeeper and governesses in England, with unhappy visits to their wealthy Cook relatives. When Thomas Gonne was posted to India in 1879 he moved the children to the south of France for health reasons. They were taught by a governess, Mme Deployant, who contributed to Maud Gonne's identification with republicanism and with France. In 1885 Colonel Gonne was appointed assistant adjutant-general for the Dublin district and Maud Gonne was presented at the levee at Dublin Castle on 9 April, wearing an iridescent dress with a train decorated with water lilies; at the castle ball on 10 April she danced with Prince Albert Victor, eldest son of the prince of Wales.<h2>
<a name="IrishnationalismWBYeats"></a>Irish nationalism: W. B. Yeats</h2>By 1886 Maud Gonne had become a nationalist; she recited &#145;Emmet's Death&#146;, from <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Nation</span> (1845), at a public dinner at which her father was present. Tommy was indulgent to her embryonic nationalism&#151;he feared that Maud might, like her mother, die young. Maud Gonne's nationalism was paradoxical: born in England of English parents she was Irish by passionate identification and remote descent.<br>
<br>In summer 1886 Maud Gonne spent time in France and Germany with her great-aunt Mary, widow of the comte de Sizeranne, who hoped to launch her as a professional beauty; Colonel Gonne intervened and took her to Bayreuth for the Wagner festival. On their return to Dublin he told Maud that he would resign his commission and become a home rule MP; her elaborate autobiographical account of this episode is possibly fabrication. Colonel Gonne died on 30 November 1886 from typhoid fever. Maud Gonne, whose relationship with her father was perhaps over close, recalled &#145;I was too bewildered to cry&#146;  (Gonne, &#145;Tower&#146;). Maud and Kathleen Gonne spent an unhappy time in London under the guardianship of their uncle William Gonne. Unaware that she would inherit a fortune on her majority Maud Gonne tried to become an actress, but became ill before she could perform; in summer 1887 she went to Royat to recover. Here she met Lucien Millevoye (1850&#150;1918), a married journalist, later a <i>d&eacute;put&eacute;</i> and &#145;at once and without any urging on his part [fell] in love with him&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 132). Although in both published and unpublished autobiographies Maud Gonne dates this fateful meeting to 1887, in 1898 she told Yeats that she had met Millevoye shortly before her father's death.<br>
<br>In December 1887 Maud Gonne inherited trust funds in excess of &pound;13,000 and an unentailed sum from her mother's estate and was free to live as she pleased. She travelled to Russia early in 1888 on a clandestine Boulangist mission; her relationship with Millevoye was also politically driven, an alliance against the British empire. She returned to Dublin and established herself in nationalist circles, becoming a close friend of the old Fenian John O'Leary. On 30 January she was in London with an introduction from John O'Leary to the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37061/', "William Butler Yeats (1865&#150;1939)")</script>. Their meeting had a political motive; Yeats was probably already a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. However, Maud Gonne's beauty&#151;tall, bronze haired, bronze-eyed and with a &#145;complexion &hellip; luminous, like that of apple-blossom through which the light falls&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 123)&#151;mobilized an obsessive passion in Yeats which lasted for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>By April 1889 Maud Gonne was pregnant by Millevoye; her first child, Georges, was born on 11 January 1890, probably in Paris, where she had an apartment. In spring 1890 she began her first political campaign against evictions in Donegal. She lectured on the horrors of eviction to English audiences, returning to Donegal in November. This campaign affected her health and she went to the south of France to recover and to spend time with Millevoye&#151;and presumably with her child.<br>
<br>In 1891 Maud Gonne spent part of the summer in Ireland in the company of Yeats but was called back to Paris where her child was seriously ill. Georges Gonne died on 31 August and she wrote Yeats a letter of &#145;wild sorrow&#146; telling him that an &#145;adopted&#146; child had died  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 47). On 11 October she accompanied Parnell's coffin to Dublin, wearing deep mourning for her son. She talked obsessively of Georges to Yeats, asking whether he could be reincarnated; she kept a photograph of the dead child for the rest of her life. Yeats and Maud Gonne were possibly briefly engaged, and in November 1891 she joined the Order of the Golden Dawn, the magical order to which he belonged, as &#145;Per Ignem ad Lucem&#146;.<br>
<br>On her return to Paris, Maud Gonne resumed her activist career, first in France as a public speaker&#151;her beauty, histrionic delivery and anti-British polemic ensuring success&#151;then in Great Britain and Ireland on behalf of the Amnesty Association. Her political bearings were complicated. She became a member of the revolutionary Irish National Alliance, but saw herself as a socialist and joined James Connolly's Irish Socialist Republican Party in 1897. She was also moulded by her right-wing Boulangist associates and endorsed antisemitic and anti-masonic conspiracy theories&#151;she was a vehement anti-Dreyfusard. Her grasp of history was simplistic, a facile contrast of English vice and Irish virtue, a &#145;melodrama with Ireland for blameless hero&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 206). She summarized her political formula: &#145;to look on which side England ranges herself &amp; go on the opposite&#146;  (White and Jeffares, 437).<br>
<br>In 1893, hoping to reincarnate her dead child, Maud Gonne and Millevoye had intercourse in the crypt of the mausoleum which she had built for Georges. The birth of her daughter Iseult Gonne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72587/', "Stuart, Iseult Lucille Germaine")</script>] in Paris on 6 August 1894 ended Maud Gonne's sexual relationship with Millevoye. She rapidly returned to work for the Amnesty Association. Early in 1897 she started her own journal, <span class="italic">L'Irlande Libre</span>, to present the Irish cause to continental Europe and was involved in the jubilee riots in Dublin in June 1897. Late in 1897 she toured the United States raising money for the 1798 centennial celebrations, with which she was deeply involved. During the celebrations she spoke widely to huge crowds.<br>
<br>In Dublin in December 1898 she and Yeats had a shared dream of an astral marriage; she then told him of her relationship with Millevoye and of the existence of Iseult, whom she brought up but did not publicly acknowledge as her daughter. Scandal concerning her had circulated in Ireland, but Yeats had discounted this. Their relationship remained close, focused on the Celtic Mystical Order which he had developed, but she refused to marry him.<h2>
<a name="Marriagelaterlife"></a>Marriage: later life</h2>In 1899&#150;1900 Maud Gonne was active in Irish and European opposition to the South African War and enthusiastically mythologized those Irishmen who fought for the Boers. One such, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37708/', "Major John MacBride (1868&#150;1916)")</script>, from a Mayo trade background, toured the United States with her in 1901, and in June 1902 she agreed to marry him. She admired MacBride, whom she thought vital and honourable. She faced opposition from friends and family&#151;as well as a supernatural warning from Tommy. Yeats begged her not to marry MacBride, reminding her of their own spiritual marriage of 1898. She told her sister that she was ageing and was tired of her lonely struggle. Maud Gonne converted to Catholicism and married MacBride on 21 February 1903 in Paris. The MacBrides travelled to Spain in April 1903, hoping to assassinate Edward VII, who was visiting Gibraltar. Maud Gonne thought that this scheme might have fatal consequences for herself: she had already made her cousin, May Bertie-Clay, Iseult's guardian.<br>
<br>In May 1903 in Dublin she told Yeats that she had made a disastrous error. However, she realized that she was pregnant and returned to Paris to salvage the situation, prepared to endure MacBride's heavy drinking and brutality. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65847/', "Se&#225;n (Seaghan) MacBride (1904&#150;1988)")</script> was born on 26 January 1904. Late in 1904 Maud Gonne discovered evidence that MacBride had sexually assaulted Iseult and that he and Eileen Wilson (1886&#150;1972), Maud's illegitimate half-sister, had had an affair before Eileen's marriage to his elder brother, Joseph. Maud Gonne initiated divorce proceedings and confessed to Yeats her disgust with &#145;a hero I had made&#146;  (White and Jeffares, 184). In a widely reported case in which Iseult was identified as her daughter she succeeded on 8 August 1906, in obtaining a legal separation and custody of Se&aacute;n. The scandal damaged her position in nationalist circles. Her pamphlet condemning Irish women who had illegitimate children by British soldiers now seemed hypocritical and in 1906 she was hissed in the Abbey Theatre, where she had acted in Yeats's <span class="italic">Kathleen ni Houlihan</span> in 1902, embodying Ireland itself. In an interview to the <span class="italic">New York Evening World</span> she denounced marriage as deplorable for an intelligent woman.<br>
<br>Maud Gonne's life became centred in France and her political activism diminished for a time, although she helped to establish a women's nationalist journal, <span class="italic">Bean na hEireann</span>, in 1908&#151;she had been a founder member of <span class="italic">Inghinidhe na hEireann</span> in 1900&#151;and was active in social causes, organizing food for poor children and for the families of striking workers in the 1913 Dublin lock-out. Yeats regularly visited Maud Gonne in Normandy and they had a brief affair, which began on the astral plane in June 1908 and was consummated in December. She ended the affair in May 1909, but Yeats remained a close friend. The outbreak of the First World War greatly distressed her: the alliance between Great Britain and France confounded her allegiances and she drew on conspiracy theories to explicate the conflict. She served as a nurse in French military hospitals during the war. The 1916 Easter rising and the execution of John MacBride transformed her life. She wore mourning and called herself Maud Gonne MacBride, insisting that &#145;Major MacBride by his Death has left a name for Se&aacute;n to be proud of. Those who die for Ireland are sacred&#146;  (White and Jeffares, 375).<br>
<br>Yeats proposed to Maud Gonne in July 1916 and on being rejected proposed unsuccessfully to Iseult. In January 1918 Maud Gonne returned to Dublin; in May she was arrested for alleged involvement in a pro-German conspiracy and transferred to Holloway prison in London. She was released in November 1918 and returned to Dublin with her children. In 1920 Iseult Gonne married the writer Francis Stuart, whom Maud Gonne thought vicious and unstable.<br>
<br>Maud Gonne initially accepted the treaty of 1921, but when the Irish civil war began in 1922 she bitterly attacked the free state government and was twice imprisoned in 1923. Age did not diminish her activism; she frequently led demonstrations on behalf of political prisoners and endorsed a marginalized IRA. In international politics her views were idiosyncratic: in 1938 she pressed what she perceived to be the positive aspects of both fascism and communism as a model for Ireland. In 1938 she published a vivid if disingenuous autobiography, <span class="italic">A Servant of the Queen</span>. She was secure in her family life, sharing Roebuck House, Clonskeagh, Dublin, with her son, daughter-in-law, and much loved grandchildren, Anna and Tiernan. She took pride in Se&aacute;n MacBride's career, both as IRA chief-of-staff and cabinet minister. She remained very close to her daughter, although she could never acknowledge the relationship. Maud Gonne died of heart disease at her home on 27 April 1953: her last recorded words were &#145;I feel now an ineffable joy&#146;  (Iseult Stuart to Francis Stuart, 2 May 1953, Southern Illinois University). Georges Gonne's booties were placed in the coffin at her request and crowds followed the funeral procession to Glasnevin cemetery on 29 April.<br>
<br>Maud Gonne was the subject of more than eighty poems by Yeats; the last, &#145;A Bronze Head&#146;, meditates on her trajectory from wild young beauty to &#145;dark tomb-haunter&#146;. Despite a lifetime's grass-roots political activism&#151;speeches, journalism, pamphleteering, protests&#151;Maud Gonne remains best known for her role in Yeats's life and work.<br>
