<span class="headword">Whalley,  Edward</span>, appointed Lord Whalley under the protectorate  (<em>d.</em> 1674/5), <span class="occ">regicide and major-general</span>, was the second son of Richard Whalley, a landowner of Kirkton and Screveton, Nottinghamshire, and his second wife, Frances Cromwell, daughter of Sir Henry Cromwell of Hinchingbrooke in Huntingdonshire. He was thus a cousin of the future lord protector, Oliver Cromwell. Whalley was admitted a pensioner of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 2 July 1614, and graduated BA in 1617 or 1618. In 1619 he was apprenticed in London to Nathaniel Bushere, a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and he became a freeman of that company in 1627. He married twice, his first wife being Judith, daughter of John Duffell of Rochester in Kent, and his second Mary Middleton. One of these wives, probably Mary, was seriously ill in July 1656 following a miscarriage. His daughter by his first wife, Frances, married his army colleague and fellow major-general William Goffe. Whalley's younger brother, Henry, was a lawyer who shared his elder sibling's political and religious outlook and during the 1650s served as one of the judges of the Scottish admiralty court and advocate-general of the English army in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>At the beginning of the first civil war Edward Whalley took up arms for parliament. He may initially have served as a cornet in the earl of Essex's army, but by 1643 he had been appointed a major in Oliver Cromwell's regiment of horse and he fought alongside his cousin for the remainder of the decade. After the battle of Gainsborough in 1643 Cromwell reported to parliament that Whalley had carried himself &#145;with all the gallantry becoming a gentleman and a Christian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 1.246). The following year he was raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and fought at the battle of Marston Moor. When the New Model Army was formed in 1645 Whalley was given command of one of the two regiments of horse created out of Cromwell's original force. He was present at the battle of Naseby and the siege of Bristol and by the end of the year was active in the Oxford area. In the spring of 1646 he laid siege to Banbury, which surrendered to him in early May. He then commanded the forces laying siege to Worcester, but before the town surrendered in late July he had been replaced by Colonel Thomas Rainborowe.<br>
<br>Whalley's friend Richard Baxter later claimed that he had been removed from the command at Worcester because he was considered too conservative in his religious outlook. Whalley was in fact probably already an Independent and was certainly a member of Thomas Goodwin's congregation in London a few years later in the early 1650s. He was, however, less hostile towards those who favoured a national church structure than most of his fellow separatists, and he had personally invited the presbyterian Baxter to act as chaplain to his New Model regiment. Baxter had found the religious opinions of many of Whalley's troopers far too radical for his taste and had subsequently resigned.<h2>
<a name="Armypoliticsandregicide"></a>Army politics and regicide</h2>Following the parliamentarian victory in the first civil war, Whalley's regiment, which contained a high proportion of religious and political radicals, was fully involved in the army's attempts to resist disbandment, and at the army council meeting at Saffron Walden in May 1647 Whalley requested that the rank and file soldiers be given more time to present their grievances to the high command. After Cornet George Joyce had seized Charles I at Holdenby in June 1647, Whalley and his regiment were given responsibility for guarding the king. They continued to hold him until his escape from army custody at Hampton Court. Throughout this time Whalley appears to have dealt with Charles with courtesy and fairness; for example, he refused to carry out orders from parliament to remove the king's chaplains without authorization from his commander, Thomas Fairfax. When Charles fled from Hampton Court in November 1647 he left Whalley a letter thanking him for the kindness he had shown him. Clarendon, however, claimed that in reality Whalley was &#145;a man of a rough and brutal temper who had offered great violence to his nature when he appeared to exercise any civility and good manners&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.262).<br>
<br>During the second civil war Whalley fought at the battle of Maidstone. He was subsequently sent in pursuit of the earl of Norwich and was present at the siege of Colchester. He attended the debates of the army council at Whitehall in December 1648 and in January 1649 was appointed one of the commissioners for the trial of Charles I. He attended every session of the court except one and signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. In March 1649, he participated in the discussions of the army officers at Whitehall about how to proceed with the reconquest of Ireland. Adopting a more conciliatory stance towards the Irish than most of his army colleagues, he argued that &#145;noe ill termes bee impos'd uppon him [the enemy], as either to eradicate the Natives, or to divest them of their estates&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 2.208). In April 1649 around thirty of Whalley's cavalry troopers, including the prominent Leveller sympathizer Robert Lockyer, mutinied and seized control of The Bull inn in Bishopsgate, London. They refused to respond to Whalley's calls for their surrender, and only submitted on the arrival of Cromwell and Fairfax several days later. Lockyer was subsequently court martialled and shot for his part in the incident. A pro-Lockyer tract which appeared in April 1649 made reference to Whalley's flamboyant taste in dress, reporting that a soldier of his regiment had found him dressed &#145;in his sky colour satin waistcoat laced with silver and his pantophles [slippers] dawbed with silver lace&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Army's Martyr</span>, 6).<br>
<br>In 1650 Whalley, who had by now been raised to the rank of commissary-general, accompanied Cromwell to Scotland and was wounded at the battle of Dunbar. Later in the year he was stationed at Carlisle, and in early December he took part in the defeat of Ker at Hamilton. In May 1651 he argued with Sir Archibald Johnston of Wariston over the providential meaning to be ascribed to the English army's success: for Whalley it was a clear sign of divine approval. He rejoined Cromwell to pursue Charles Stuart into England and in September fought at the battle of Worcester. In August 1652 he presented the petition from the army which called on the Rump Parliament to proceed more quickly with a programme of constitutional and legal reforms, and after the Rumpers failed to respond he supported their suppression in April 1653 and the establishment of the protectorate at the end of that year.<br>
<br>Whalley purchased a number of crown and royalist lands during the early 1650s. These included the manors of Sibthorpe in Nottinghamshire, bought from the trustees of the earl of Devonshire's estate, and of West Walton in Norfolk which had formerly been owned by Henrietta Maria. The Rump Parliament also made over to him lands in Scotland worth &pound;500 per annum, and in October 1653 he purchased fenland in Cambridgeshire from a private owner.<h2>
<a name="Majorgeneral"></a>Major-general</h2>Whalley represented his native Nottinghamshire in the first protectorate parliament of 1654&#150;5. In the autumn of 1655 he was appointed one of Cromwell's major-generals and given responsibility for an east midland association made up of the counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Warwickshire. Writing to Cromwell in late January 1656 to thank him for appointing Whalley as their major-general, the Nottinghamshire commissioners for the securing of the peace of the Commonwealth described him as &#145;our native countryman, of an ancient and honourable family, and of singuler justice, abilitie and piety&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 34, fol. 767).<br>
<br>Whalley was one of the first of the major-generals to be active, starting work in Nottinghamshire at the beginning of November 1655 and spending the remainder of that month touring his counties &#145;to set the wheeles agoing&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 32, fol. 177). Once he had completed the initial arrangements for the assessing and collection of the decimation tax within his association, he concentrated most of his energies on the attempt to bring about a moral reformation, an aspect of the major-generals' work which he considered to be of the utmost importance. As early as the end of November he informed Cromwell's secretary of state, John Thurloe, that the government's reform aspirations were foundering on the lack of commitment shown by the local magistracy. Complaining that &#145;what some justices in order to reformation doe, others undoe&#146;, he urged the government to place the major-generals into the commissions of the peace of their areas  (ibid., fol. 806). He also made a particular effort to win the backing of the godly clergy of the east midlands for his reform efforts, and in Coventry he assisted the puritan mayor, Robert Beake, in his efforts to combat irreligion and ungodliness in the town.<br>
<br>By early 1656 Whalley believed his efforts were beginning to achieve results. He told Thurloe in early January that he had been very busy ejecting suspect clergymen, arresting vagrants, and closing down unlicensed alehouses &#145;which were growne to incredible numbers&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 34, fol. 428). A few days later he added: &#145;You cannot imagine what an awe it hath strucke into the spirits of wicked men what incouragement it is to the godly&#146;  (ibid., fol. 563). By late April he was claiming that &#145;you may ride over all Nottinghamshire and not see a beggar or wandring rogue, and I hope suddenly to have it so in all the counties&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 37, fols. 570&#150;73). He had arrested so many vagrants and beggars that the gaols of his association were full and he repeatedly requested permission from the government to proceed with their transportation.<br>
<br>But if Whalley was fully committed to the goals of moral reformation, he also as major-general displayed the more conciliatory, eirenic side to his character. He allowed the annual horse-race for Lady Grantham's Cup to be run at Lincoln in the spring of 1656, and later told Cromwell that he had assured the earl of Exeter that &#145;it was not your highnes intention in the suppressing of horse races to abridge gentlemen of that sport&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 36, fol. 371). He also showed more interest than most of his fellow major-generals in social issues. In March 1656 he praised the assize judge Matthew Hale for the great concern he had shown for poor litigants while on circuit in the east midlands, and he subsequently wrote to Thurloe to urge the government to take action to prevent fraudulent practices in markets, profiteering by tradesmen and alehouse keepers, and enclosure which led to depopulation and unemployment. He even commissioned his own survey of the effects of enclosure in Leicestershire, and in December 1656 he tried unsuccessfully to introduce into parliament a bill to prevent further enclosure.<br>
<br>Whalley also continued to display during the 1650s the same tolerant approach towards religious differences that he had shown in the mid-1640s. In December 1655 he expressed his firm support for the re-admission of the Jews into England, informing Thurloe: &#145;I am glad so godly and prudent a course is taken concerning the Jewes, yet cannot conceave the reason why so greate variety of opinion should be amongst men as I heare are called to consult about them&#146;. He added that he believed there were both &#145;politique and divine reasons&#146; for allowing them to return, the principal of these being the economic benefits to the state and the increased opportunity it would allow to bring about their conversion to Christianity  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 33, fols. 355&#150;8).<br>
<br>Whalley was returned to the second protectorate parliament for Nottinghamshire. During the debates on how to proceed against the Quaker James Nayler in December 1656 he declared that he believed Nayler to be guilty of horrid blasphemy but also attempted to cool the passions of his fellow members and to reconcile their different positions, commenting at one point: &#145;I would have this agreed upon in peace and charity; that those that are for a low punishment might not be censured for coldness, nor those for a higher punishment censured for a preposterous zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.101&#150;2). He himself favoured the death penalty for Nayler, but suggested that a reprieve should be offered him if he recanted after sentence. Along with his fellow major-generals, Whalley both supported Disbrowe's <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> in December 1656 and January 1657, and opposed the moves to make Cromwell king in the spring of 1657. In early April 1657 he was one of the tellers for the noes when the house voted to renew their offer of the crown after Cromwell's initial rejection. Some contemporaries, however, reported that by the time Cromwell finally rejected the offer of the crown in early May Whalley and two of his fellow major-generals, William Goffe and William Boteler, had become reconciled to a return of the monarchy. Later in 1657 Whalley was appointed to Cromwell's House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="Restorationandexile"></a>Restoration and exile</h2>After Oliver Cromwell's death Whalley supported his son, Richard, in his political struggle against the army, but he failed to persuade his regiment to follow this line. Following the return of the Rump in 1659 Whalley was relieved of command of his regiment and refused another commission. In November 1659 he and his son-in-law William Goffe were part of a four-man delegation sent to Scotland to outline to Colonel Monck the reasons for the expulsion of the Rump, but their trip failed to bring about a reconciliation between Monck and the New Model regiments stationed in England.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Whalley and Goffe, who as regicides were both excluded from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, fled to New England, Whalley using the name Richardson. They arrived at Boston in July 1660 and lived initially in Cambridge. In 1661 they moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where tradition has it they lived in a cave in the woods outside the town for three years to avoid discovery by the agents sent from England to capture them. In 1664 they moved on to Hadley, Massachusetts, where they remained until their deaths. All efforts to arrest them proved fruitless as the colonists were generally sympathetic to the fugitive regicides and refused to reveal their whereabouts. A report in the Colonial State Papers declares that they were held in &#145;exceeding great esteem for their piety and parts&#146; and that they &#145;held meetings where they preached and prayed, and were looked upon as men dropped down from heaven&#146;. Another later report stated that they were feasted in every place they visited and provided with horses and guides  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 5.54, 345). Details are also in existence of the attempts by Charles II's agents to apprehend them  (ibid., 45, 80, 81, 96, 160&#150;2, 1103, 1300).<br>
<br>By 1674 Whalley was in very poor health. Goffe wrote to his wife in August of that year that her father was &#145;scarce capable of any rational discourse, his understanding memory and speech doth so much fail him and [he] seems not to take much notice of anything that is either done or said, but patiently bears all things&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). &#145;Your old Friend&#146;, Goffe wrote to Whalley's brother-in-law William Hooke, &#145;&hellip; saith I desire nothing but to acquaint myselfe with Je: Chr: &amp; that fullnesse that is in him for those that Beleeve and have interest in him. This sentence he uttered with some stopps, yet with more freedom and clearnesse than usuall&#146;  (&#145;Letters and papers relating to the regicides&#146;, 155&#150;6). Whalley died soon afterwards and was buried at Hadley in an unmarked grave.<br>
