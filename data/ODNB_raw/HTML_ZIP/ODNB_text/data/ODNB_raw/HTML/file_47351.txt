<span class="headword">Fenwick,  Charles</span>  (1850&#150;1918), <span class="occ">trade union leader and politician</span>, was born on 5 May 1850, the son of John Fenwick, a miner, in a colliery house at Paradise Row, Cramlington, Northumberland. Although he spent some time at the village school, his considerable education was primarily the result of his own efforts. In later life, he cited Mazzini, Macaulay, Scott, and Kingsley among his favourite reading, as well as specifically religious works and accounts of missionary explorers.<br>
<br>At the age of ten, after a short period of surface work, Fenwick went underground, working between twelve and thirteen hours a day. His working day was considerably shortened when, at seventeen, he joined the colliery's &eacute;lite band of hewers. He now had more time for reading and became active in the Northumberland miners' union, which he had joined at the age of thirteen. In 1869 he married a local girl, Jane Gardner; they had two sons. By the mid-1870s, while still a working miner, Fenwick was a local union leader, and often served as branch delegate or in negotiations with employers. He represented the union at the 1884 TUC meeting.<br>
<br>When the redistribution of 1884&#150;5 created a new Wansbeck constituency dominated by the mining vote, Fenwick was elected its first MP, and he held the seat with little difficulty for thirty-two years. Despite his moderation, and his open opposition to the concept of a separate Labour Party, he was secretary of the TUC parliamentary committee from 1890 to 1894. Although not so well known as contemporary Labour leaders like Keir Hardie, he played an important part in consolidating Labour parliamentary representation.<br>
<br>Never a socialist, Fenwick steadfastly maintained the principles of Gladstonian Liberalism in his political and union activities, even when this meant conflict with other leaders of the labour movement, including Hardie and David Shackleton. These differences surfaced clearly during his four year stint as secretary of the TUC parliamentary committee. He was elected to this post in 1890, just after the TUC narrowly endorsed the principle of a statutory eight-hour day for miners, something to which Fenwick was known to be opposed. He continued to oppose this policy in the House of Commons, despite a running fire of criticism from more militant miners' leaders. Eventually, in 1894, he was defeated in the election for the secretaryship of the parliamentary committee, although this rejection was accompanied by tributes to his honesty and consistency on the issue of legislative restriction of working hours and similar issues. In 1911 he supported unsuccessful proposals for regulating the right to strike by imposing a compulsory &#145;cooling-off&#146; period, with fines for workers who defied the restriction.<br>
<br>Fenwick was conspicuously respectable and devout, and was for many years a Primitive Methodist preacher. His parliamentary career, though less dramatic than that of his more ebullient colleagues, helped to establish the position of Labour representatives. The first Labour member to be appointed to the important Commons committee for selection, he became a house deputy chairman and on many occasions presided over the Commons in committee. He served on a number of important royal commissions dealing with labour questions and similar topics. He was chosen to second the address in 1894, and appointed a privy councillor in the coronation honours of 1911. By the latter years of Fenwick's career, the political position of Lib&#150;Lab MPs was becoming more difficult. When, in 1907, the Northumberland miners' union voted to affiliate to the infant Labour Party, Fenwick, together with his colleague Thomas Burt, refused to toe the line. Both men were returned as independent Liberals in the 1910 general elections, and their personal prestige was still able to ensure that they did not face Labour opponents.<br>
<br>Fenwick died at his Newcastle home, 14 Tankerville Terrace, on 20 April 1918, having previously announced his impending retirement from parliament. He was survived by his wife. His funeral was attended by the city's lord mayor and prominent northern coal-owners, as well as a variety of political and union colleagues. Like his friends John Burnett and Thomas Burt, Fenwick was much cited as an illustration of how a worker could attain a position of dignity and prominence in late Victorian and Edwardian society.<br>
