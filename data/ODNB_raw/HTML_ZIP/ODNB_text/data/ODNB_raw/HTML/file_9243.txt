<span class="headword">Featley <span class="st"> [Fairclough]</span>,  John</span>  (1604/5&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Northamptonshire, the son of John Featley. He matriculated from All Souls College, Oxford, on 4 November 1620 at fifteen, and graduated BA on 25 February 1625. Shortly after his ordination Featley sailed, in 1626, for the island of St Christopher (now St Kitts), where he was &#145;the first preacher of the gospel&#146;. His sponsor was Sir Thomas Warner, appointed governor of the island in 1629. On 6 September 1629, during a brief visit to England, Featley preached a sermon at St Botolph, Aldersgate, London, published as <span class="italic">A sermon preached to the nobely deserving gentleman, Sir Thomas Warner, and the rest of his companie, bound to the West Indies</span> (1629). Back on St Kitts by 3 May 1630, he attended as one of its members a meeting of the governing committee of the island, at which evidence was heard concerning seditious remarks reported to have been uttered in this new and remote colonial outpost. It must have been about this time that he married Anna, niece of Pierce Powell, with whom, as he recalled in 1666, he lived about thirty-five years and travelled thousands of leagues.<br>
<br>In 1635 Featley was in England again, acting as curate at Lambeth, Surrey, for his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9242/', "Daniel Featley (1582&#150;1645)")</script>, a well-known critic of nonconformity. John's visitation sermon preached at St Saviour's, Southwark, published as <span class="italic">Obedience and Submission</span> (1636), reveals him as a leading defender of the Laudian church. Featley was anxious that all should obey the king's government, including its ecclesiastical magistrates, whom &#145;he appoints for the sweet, harmonious government of the church, by religious and just discipline&#146;  (p. 7). Even the moderate puritans, who &#145;better relish our doctrine than our discipline [must] &hellip; stoope low enough to enter in at the gate&#146;  (p. 24), and the day had passed of &#145;the grave bearded brownists &hellip; the down-lookt separatists, [and] the disorderly anabaptists&#146;  (p. 10). Such views fitted well with the latest official thinking, and according to Featley's own account he was in 1639 made chaplain to Charles I &#145;at Huntly fields, during the first Scottish expedition&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 226).<br>
<br>In November 1642, while Featley was at Acton, Middlesex, acting as curate for the rector, his uncle Daniel, there arrived, fresh from the encounter at nearby Turnham Green, radical soldiers of the city militia determined to confront their chief tormentor. Having vented their wrath upon the inside of the church some set up in the parsonage, and others set off for Lambeth to look for Daniel. Shortly after this John Featley was invited to return to St Kitts, and on 24 June 1643, with wife, children, and servants, he set sail from Tilbury Hope, in a ship (appropriately enough) &#145;pestered with brownists, anabaptists and antinomians, etc&#146;  (Featley, <span class="italic">Featlaei</span>, 2.39&#150;40). Featley himself had gloated at those who &#145;have quit our country for their Canaan &hellip; the fear of conformity hath made them to use the wings of their ships&#146;, bidding them good riddance and &#145;a prosperous gale to carry them to their port&#146;  (Featley, <span class="italic">Obedience and Submission</span>, 21&#150;2). This proved ironic. About 1645 Featley returned briefly to England, but soon took ship again for the near continent. On one of these voyages:<blockquote>The boisterous and churlish swelling of a rough and troublesome Severn, full of unexpected turnings and windings, carrying us far to sea, was the cause of embalming two of my children in the salt ocean and was like to prove the ruin of four more of them, besides the beloved wife of my bosom. (Featley, <span class="italic">Fountaine</span>, preface *5)</blockquote>By 1646, however, Featley was safe at &#145;my house in Flushing&#146; in Zeeland, from where he signed the epistle of <span class="italic">A Fountaine of Teares</span> to Elizabeth, wife of Gilbert Keate (probably the grocer and alderman, <i>d</i>. 1659), a work which she had encouraged him to begin some five years earlier.<br>
<br>Nothing is certainly known of Featley's activities during the period of the Commonwealth and protectorate, though he may have returned with his family to Acton. In 1660 his fortunes improved abruptly; that summer he was appointed the king's extraordinary chaplain, and on 7 June 1661 he was created DD at Oxford. About August 1660 he petitioned for a crown presentation to the rectory of Beckingham, Lincolnshire; it is not known whether this was granted but he appears in May 1661 as rector of Langar in that county. Featley also won institution to the valuable rectory of Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire, on the presentation of the dean and chapter of Lincoln, soon after his appointment to offices in Lincoln Cathedral. On 24 September 1660 he was installed in person as its precentor, having repulsed a challenge from Hugh Barcroft. He also won possession of the annexed prebend of Kilsby, rendering nugatory the institution to it on 1 November 1660 of John Whiston. It also appears from his will that he won a long struggle over the prebend of Scamblesby, against a determined challenge from Timothy Welfitt.<br>
<br>Despite these material comforts Featley found much to discontent him when he drew up his will on 1 May 1666. First he was plagued with &#145;the grinding pains of the stone&#146;. Then there was his &#145;disobedient and rebellious daughter&#146; Anna, who had left home and &#145;had been of great charge to me in maintaining her abroad&#146;. Anna, it seems, had become involved with a &#145;baker of Acton&#146; and his wife who had &#145;extorted from me, by cunning meanes, three score pounds by keeping her from me&#146;. His eldest son, John, had &#145;married against my will&#146; despite all his father's &#145;importunacies&#146;  (Lincs. Arch., D &amp; C will, 11/144). But Featley was able to provide generously for John, and for the eleven other surviving children of his marriage to Anna. He died at Lincoln, and was buried in the chancel of Lincoln Cathedral on 3 March 1667. His wife survived him, but had been &#145;long sicke and weake&#146;  (will) when, on 20 October 1667, aged fifty-two, she made her will, proved on 3 December 1668.<br>
