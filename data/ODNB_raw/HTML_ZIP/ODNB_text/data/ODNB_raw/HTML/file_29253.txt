<span class="headword">Bradshaw <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>White]</span>,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Augustine of St John]</span>  (1575/6&#150;1618), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born near Worcester, the third son of John Bradshaw, a citizen of Worcester who &#145;bore office in that towne &hellip; executing &hellip; the office of one of the chiefest Magistrates of the towne&#146;, and his wife, Anne Warmestrey, through whom he was related to a number of prominent families, including the Crofts of Croft Castle  (McCann and Connolly, 244). Both his parents were Roman Catholics. He was educated at the free school in Worcester. The Jesuit Edward Oldcorne was chaplain at Hindlip, near Worcester, and it was most likely through him that young Bradshaw was introduced to Henry Garnett, the Jesuit superior, who sent him to St Omer. On 21 February 1596 he arrived at the English College at Valladolid. The Jesuit superiors recognized his leadership qualities and he was made prefect over his companions. During a dangerous illness in the winter of 1598&#150;9 he vowed to become a religious if his life were spared. Already several English youths in Rome had joined the Italian monks of Monte Cassino and other Benedictine monasteries with the hope of one day returning to England. He was the first of a stream of students to leave the seminary for the monastery of San Benito in Valladolid in April 1599. After a month's postulancy he was sent to the abbey of San Martino, Compostela, where he was received as a novice on 26 May and took the programmatic name of Augustine. In 1600 he was professed with four others (one of them being John (Leander) Jones), who had followed him from the seminary. He then went to the University of Salamanca. On 5 December 1602, in spite of the opposition of the Jesuits, Clement VIII granted formal permission to the English Benedictines, both in Spain and in Italy, to return to their country as missionaries. As soon as the news arrived he set out for England with three others on 26 December and arrived just as Elizabeth was dying.<br>
<br>Bradshaw had been appointed superior over his companions. He seems to have worked at first in his native county. He is also very likely the White mentioned as a priest haunting Worcestershire and the neighbouring counties. So many young Englishmen desired to join the Benedictines that it was soon evident that steps must be taken to find a spot more accessible than Spain for a monastery in which English subjects could be trained. So in the spring of 1604 he set out again to attend the general chapter of the Spanish Benedictines and lay before his superiors the plan. On his way he called upon the nuncio in Paris, and there it was that most likely his attention was first directed to Douai as a suitable position for the proposed foundation, it being a university town with rich abbeys close at hand. The Spanish abbots agreed to the proposal, and he returned to England with the title of vicar-general over the monks working there.<br>
<br>During the early part of 1605 Bradshaw was na&iuml;vely engaged in a scheme for purchasing a toleration for English Catholics from the government, high hopes being raised by the accession of James I. Garnett, the Jesuit superior, had lately failed in a similar attempt, and was less sanguine in his views of the government's intentions. When Bradshaw's negotiations proved unsuccessful, he blamed the Jesuits for their failure.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1605 Thomas Arundell, first Baron Arundell of Wardour, had taken command of an English regiment in the service of the Archduke Albert against the Dutch, who no longer had the support of England, which had made peace with Spain in 1604. He brought Augustine Bradshaw out of England with him to be chaplain-general of that regiment. Coniers, a Jesuit, also joined the camp at Ostend as one of the chaplains, but he by no means liked being under the command of the Benedictine chaplain-general. All other plans failing, it was determined to get rid of him by procuring the dismissal of Lord Arundell. The regiment was mutinous and riven with factions suspecting each other of being agents of the English government and secretly in league with the Dutch. James Blount, one of the officers, was sent, with recommendations &#145;to blast his late colonel&#146; at the Spanish court, and succeeded so well that at the end of May 1606 Lord Arundell and almost half of the officers were cashiered, and with them, of course, the chaplain-general.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Bradshaw was also battling with opposition to the monastic foundation in Douai which he began in 1606 and for which he had enlisted the patronage of the wealthy and influential Philippe de Caverel, abbot of St Vaast in Arras. The many defections to local Benedictines of students at the English colleges at Rome and Valladolid made his project unwelcome to Thomas Worthington, president of the English College, Douai, which was then in a rather parlous condition. Worthington's efforts to get the Benedictine foundation prohibited by appealing to Caraffa, the nuncio in Brussels, and then to Rome, were supported by Robert Persons, who thought the conversion of England would be best secured by a unitary mission under firm Jesuit leadership and that the Benedictine monasteries there, if recovered, should not be restored to the Benedictines, but be at the disposal of the church in general. The local Jesuits also feared that the school the Benedictines intended to open would compete with their own establishment in St Omer. But with his characteristic address and adroitness Bradshaw outmanoeuvred these objectors and by 1609 not only did St Gregory's Priory at Douai, the ancestor of the present Downside community, receive full ecclesiastical and civil authorization, but amicable relations between the principal contenders became normal thereafter. In the thick of these troubles Bradshaw acquired, in December 1605, a former collegiate church at Dieulouard, Lorraine (therefore in French territory), to be a possible refuge in case the Douai scheme came to nothing. Here came to be established the monastery of St Laurence which, at the French Revolution would transfer to England and settle at Ampleforth.<br>
<br>While engaged in this struggle Bradshaw was able to help the secular clergy. He obtained, from the munificent Caverel, Arras College in Paris as a house of study for the English clergy who were to devote themselves to writing. The house was to be a counter-blast to Chelsea College, lately established for anti-Catholic controversialists by James I. In 1611 Bradshaw founded St Benedict's Monastery at St Malo with the help of Gabriel Gifford, later to be archbishop of Rheims, in order to relieve the pressure of numbers at Dieulouard.<br>
<br>As vicar-general, Bradshaw was constantly in England superintending the numerous subjects who were working on the mission. In 1614 there were over eighty. Before Persons's death (1610) Bradshaw began his negotiations for a reunion of all English Benedictines into one congregation. Three groups had emerged. The monks from Italy (never more than a dozen) had secured for two of their own men, Edward Maihew and Vincent Sadler, an aggregation to the monastery of Westminster, then represented by its last survivor, old Father Robert (or Sigebert) Buckley. These two, who were joined later on by a third (19 December 1609), therefore represented the historic English Benedictine congregation. Bradshaw's Anglo-Spanish subjects were numerous: they possessed houses and men. The Italians had neither; the old English had only the succession. These two latter parties were desirous of a union, and Bradshaw entered enthusiastically into the project. What would suit the smaller bodies would be for the Anglo-Spanish monks to furnish men, money, and houses, while the others acted as superiors. The incongruity of such an arrangement did not seem to strike Bradshaw, who, on 13 February 1610, signed an agreement of ten articles. His precipitate action was greatly resented by the rest of his brethren, and the monks at Douai appealed to their ultimate superior, the general of the Spanish Benedictines, and Bradshaw was summoned to Spain in 1612. The result was that he was removed from his vicarship as well as from the priorship of St Gregory's, where there was much discontent with his over-strict regime, and John (Leander) Jones was set up in his place. The union with the old English congregation was eventually brought about under more equitable terms. But Bradshaw was as resilient as ever. On his way back from Spain he came to the notice of the famous Capuchin Joseph du Tremblay, Richelieu's <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>. The friar was then engaged in his work of reforming certain abbeys, and had lately taken a special interest in the order of Fontevrault. Under his influence the abbess, Louise de Bourbon, with her coadjutor, Antoinette d'Orl&eacute;ans, was desirous of restoring monastic observance in the houses of monks and nuns subject to her rule. Bradshaw was recommended by Tremblay &#145;as one full of zeal, sanctity, ability, and energy&#146;. He began his work in October 1613, and was so successful that he was called to a like work in the abbeys of Chelles, Remiremont, and Poitiers. He also became engaged in a projected union of the monks of Fontevrault with the English monks at Douai. But, although this would have been of material advantage to the latter, further reflection showed the vicar-general that it would drain the mission of men and be a tax beyond the strength of his English monks. So the matter was dropped, and he was withdrawn. In 1615 he was sent to found a house for English monks in Paris, and for one year presided over its destinies. This evolved into St Edmund's Priory, Paris, whose community later settled at Douai Abbey, near Reading. In 1616, having a well earned reputation for observance, he was sent to reform the Cluniac priory of Longueville, near Rouen, where he died, aged forty-two, on 4 May 1618 and where he was buried.<br>
<br>Bradshaw was a frank, open-minded man, with a singular winning way, which always made a striking first impression. His generous nature led him into impetuous actions which caused difficulties a more prudent man would have escaped. It is perhaps open to question whether he would have succeeded so well as he did had he not had the help of such men as John Roberts and John (Leander) Jones to supply the deficiencies of his character.<br>
