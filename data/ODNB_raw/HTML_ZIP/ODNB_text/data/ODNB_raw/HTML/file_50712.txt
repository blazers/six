<span class="headword">Lyttelton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clive]</span>,  Mary Kathleen</span>  (1856&#150;1907), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was the second daughter of George Clive (1805&#150;1880) of Ballycrog, co. Mayo, and Perrystone Court, Herefordshire, and his wife, Ann Sybella Martha (<i>d</i>. 1907), second daughter of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar. Mary's father was for many years chairman of Herefordshire quarter sessions, a Metropolitan Police magistrate, and, from 1852 to 1862, under-secretary of state for the Home Office.<br>
<br>On 3 August 1880 Mary married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34655/', "Revd Arthur Temple Lyttelton (1852&#150;1903)")</script>, then tutor at Keble College, Oxford. In 1882, when her husband was appointed master of Selwyn College, they moved to Cambridge, where &#145;the early generations of Selwyn men were conscious of Mrs Lyttelton's influence as the hostess at the lodge&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Lyttelton later became bishop of Southampton (1898).<br>
<br>Mary Lyttelton devoted much of her life to fighting for the improvement of women's lives in general, and for the extension of the suffrage to women in particular. Three years after the formation of the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW) in 1895 she was among the vice-presidents; she also served on the executive committee before taking over the post of president of the NUWW. Believing firmly that &#145;the withholding of the franchise is very prejudicial to the right development of women, and that the education given by the vote is essential to their true progress&#146;  (Mrs A. T. Lyttelton, <span class="italic">Women and their Work</span>, 1901, 10), Mrs Lyttelton also sat on the executive committee of the Central Society for Women's Suffrage, formed in 1888 when the women's movement split over its relationship with the main political parties, before it reformed in 1897 as the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies.<br>
<br>Mrs Lyttelton's views were succinctly set out in her book <span class="italic">Women and their Work</span>, which she published in 1901. Including chapters on &#145;the family&#146;, &#145;the household&#146;, and &#145;philanthropic and social work&#146;, the book was a manual advising women on modes of behaviour, duties, and goals. She believed that such a manual was required because, at the beginning of the twentieth century, society, and particularly the position of women in society, was in a state of transition and &#145;it is with women at this moment that the power to advance and the power to convince lies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women and their Work</span>, 11). <span class="italic">Women and their Work</span> was permeated with her deep religious beliefs: she held that each sex should strive for the &#145;Christian ideal&#146; of &#145;preserving its own special characteristics&#146; while attempting &#145;to acquire the highest qualities of the other&#146;  (ibid., 25). A woman, she argued, would never be able to advise or be useful to men unless the &#145;inspiring motive&#146; of her life was &#145;to glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever&#146;  (ibid., 4).<br>
<br>Mary Lyttelton's approach to social activism was a practical one. She had spent three years as a poor-law guardian and had found the experience invaluable: &#145;The value of knowing that you are working so to speak, before the public, and that if you make a mistake it will be known, is immense&#146;  (Hollis, 17). She was an impressive and intelligent public speaker: her obituary writer in the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span> opined that &#145;Few who heard it will forget the brilliant paper, touched with delightful humour, which she read so recently as last October at the Women's Suffrage meetings of the NUWW at Tunbridge Wells.&#146; &#145;A considerable student of literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Jan 1907), she worked for many years as a journalist, writing reviews and eventually becoming editor of the women's section of the high-church paper, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. She died on 13 January 1907 at Perrystone Court, Herefordshire, from influenza and weakness of the heart, and was survived by a daughter and two sons.<br>
