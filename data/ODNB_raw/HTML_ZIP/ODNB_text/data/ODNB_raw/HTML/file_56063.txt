<span class="headword">Senior,  William</span>  (1861&#150;1937), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was born on 17 December 1861 at Bond Street, Wakefield, Yorkshire, the son (there was also a daughter) of Thomas Senior (<i>d</i>. 1892), solicitor, and his wife, Lucy Ellen Winter. He was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1879, and graduated BA in 1883. Admitted a solicitor in 1886, he practised law alone in Wakefield.<br>
<br>In 1891 Senior published <span class="italic">Tutor and Pupils: Talks about Twelve Law Maxims</span>. He was a member of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, and in 1894 published <span class="italic">The Old Wakefield Theatre</span>, a historical account. In 1895, following the death of his father, with whom he had lately been in partnership, he gave up his Yorkshire practice and moved to London. Resigning from the roll of solicitors, he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 29 April 1896, though the nature of his subsequent law practice remains obscure.<br>
<br>From 1902 to 1908 Senior wrote frequent articles for <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Punch</span>; he is to be distinguished from the William Senior (<i>d</i>. 1920) who was editor of <span class="italic">The Field</span> during this period. He contributed regularly to the <span class="italic">Mariner's Mirror</span> from its inception in 1911 until 1913; from 1913 to 1919, he belonged to its editorial committee. He was a member of the council of the Society for Nautical Research from 1912 to 1927.<br>
<br>Senior was particularly interested in questions of maritime law, but he also wrote on general problems relating to the navy and the merchant marine. Much of his research was done at the Public Record Office; his articles, most of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Mariner's Mirror</span> and the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, dealt with the maritime courts, their judges and lawyers, and the trials there. His <span class="italic">Doctors' Commons</span> (1922) is anecdotal legal history for the layman, based upon a wide range of sources. The collection of old maritime cases which he published in <span class="italic">Naval History in the Law Courts</span> (1927) is of interest for the examples of situations involving common seamen.<br>
<br>His interest in English maritime courts and naval matters led Senior to maritime law in general. From 1930 until his death in 1937, Senior wrote an average of one article a year for the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>. These eight articles are short pieces about various European jurists and their contacts with medieval England.<br>
<br>Senior died of a heart attack on 28 January 1937, at his home, 13 Alexandra Mansions, Chelsea, London. He had never married, and his residuary legatee was Clare College, Cambridge, which received approximately &pound;46,000 &#145;for the furtherance of the studies of legal history and comparative law&#146;.<br>
