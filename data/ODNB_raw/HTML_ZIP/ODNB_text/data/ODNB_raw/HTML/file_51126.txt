<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Alfred Hawthorne <span class="st"> [Benny]</span></span>  (1924&#150;1992), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born in Southampton on 25 January 1924, the younger son and second of three children of Alfred Hill (<i>d</i>. 1971), a former circus performer and the manager of a surgical appliance shop in Southampton, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cave. His father's occupation caused Hill some childhood embarrassment, being taunted by shouts of &#145;Hillie's dad sells french letters&#146;. His mother was by all accounts a sweet, loving person&#151;a love reciprocated by the young Alfred. At the age of eleven he won a scholarship to the Richard Taunton School in Southampton, but he left in 1939, when he was fifteen. After a variety of menial jobs he became a milkman driving a horse-drawn cart round Southampton and fantasizing that he was Wyatt Earp, or some other Western legend. He later capitalized on this experience with the song &#145;Ernie&#151;the Fastest Milkman in the West&#146;, which was a number one hit in 1971. In the early 1940s Hill became an accomplished semi-professional entertainer, specializing in broad comedy and <i>double entendres</i> that were largely lifted from Max Miller, the popular comedian of the day.<br>
<br>In 1943, after a mix-up in Cardiff where he had been arrested as a deserter (his call-up papers had never reached him), Hill duly joined the army as a driver/mechanic in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He hated it, and after the war never drove again. In 1945 he applied to and was taken on by the army entertainment unit &#145;Stars in battledress&#146;. There he was spotted by Colonel Richard Stone, who liked him so much that when he returned to civilian life and started a theatrical agency he recruited Hill as one of his first clients. Before that Private Hill had become Mr Hill, his service career behind him, and after auditioning unsuccessfully at the Windmill Theatre in 1947 he considered his future; Alf Hill did not have the right ring to it and, after considering alternatives, Hill settled on Benny&#151;the American comedian Jack Benny being one of his heroes. He then tried out his comedy material in pubs and working men's clubs&#151;a tough but useful training ground for a would-be funny man.<br>
<br>Moving up-market in 1947 Hill appeared in a revue, <span class="italic">Spotlight</span>, at the Twentieth-Century Theatre in Notting Hill Gate, and after that came more appearances in pubs and clubs. It was now that Richard Stone took over and in 1948 he booked Hill into a seaside summer season in Cliftonville, Kent, in the show <span class="italic">Gay Time</span>, as &#145;feed&#146; (that is, straight man) to principal comedian Reg Varney, who described Hill as &#145;brilliant&#146;. Hill was indeed brilliant as a feed, but not yet as a solo comedian. However, television had erupted in the early 1950s and was to take Hill out of the also-rans and, in time, to make him an internationally known English comedian&#151;momentarily perhaps even more famous than Chaplin&#151;and a multi-millionaire. At a time when television was grateful for anything, Hill wrote and performed material that was well above the average for the day, and he also used the medium's technical flexibility, which enabled him to perform such tricks as impersonating the entire line-up of panel games, both male and female.<br>
<br>Now established on television, Hill returned to radio in 1954 with the successful series starring ventriloquist Peter Brough, <span class="italic">Educating Archie</span>, in which he played the tutor of the dummy Archie. In that role he followed in the footsteps of Tony Hancock, Max Bygraves, and Beryl Reid, among others. Then came West End theatre in the shape of <span class="italic">Paris by Night</span> (1955), which featured a number of scantily dressed showgirls. The revue, which co-starred the accident-prone comedy magician Tommy Cooper, ran for a year. Hill's next stage venture was in 1959. <span class="italic">Fine Fettle</span>, at the Palace Theatre, was a musical revue. The critic Milton Shulman, writing in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in August 1959, commented that Hill brought &#145;a secret lip-smacking irreverence, which gives his humour a boisterous, even bawdy, quality&#146;. This insight summed up the whole of Hill's work. Popular as he was when he was alive, after his death he disappeared from the public consciousness very quickly, and if remembered at all it was largely for his grossness and lack of subtlety.<br>
<br>Hill's film career was not startling. In 1956 he starred in <span class="italic">Who Done It?</span>, written by T. E. B. Clarke and directed by Basil Dearden. According to Hill it was not a happy d&eacute;but. His next film was <span class="italic">Light up the Sky</span>, in 1959, in which he and Tommy Steele co-starred as partners in a music-hall double act who were called up in the Second World War and stationed on a searchlight battery. In 1965 he had a cameo role in <span class="italic">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</span>, and in 1968 another cameo role in <span class="italic">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</span>. In 1969 came <span class="italic">The Italian Job</span>, which starred No&euml;l Coward and Michael Caine, and in which Benny Hill played a sex-mad computer expert who lusted after large women and wound up in gaol. In 1970 he co-produced a short film, <span class="italic">Eddie in August</span>, in which he played a girl chaser (unlucky, of course). It was not a success, and Hill went back to the safer waters of television.<br>
<br>Apart from television shows at the BBC and at Thames Television, Hill appeared in television commercials for a popular soft drink of the day. His one essay into the classical repertory was to play Bottom in an Associated Rediffusion Television production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> in 1964. His most popular television character was Fred Scuttle, a lisping, bespectacled buffoon, but, that said, his characters all had a certain similarity&#151;whatever the hat or the wig he had on, it was always the same Benny Hill underneath. In 1980, in the <span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span>, Howard Rosenberg wrote of Hill's astonishing impact on American television:<blockquote>Hill's unlikely stylistic mix of Charlie Chaplin, Ernie Kovacs and Milton Berle&#151;the film speed-ups, blackouts, visual gags, drag queening, cheap double entendres and bawdy songs&#151;emerges as a sort of polished drivel, a triumph of trash so revolting that unbelievably you tend to like it.</blockquote>Hill was eventually sacked from Thames Television in 1988, after a ten-minute interview. He was understandably upset, but his ratings were falling, and some of his jokes and characterizations had been recycled once too often. He died, unmarried, of heart failure in his flat in Twickenham Road, Teddington, London, on Saturday 18 April 1992. He was alone and his body was not discovered until the following Tuesday&#151;a sad end for a man who had made the world laugh.<br>
