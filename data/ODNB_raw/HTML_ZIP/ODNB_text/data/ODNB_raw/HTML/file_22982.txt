<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Henry</span>, fourth earl of Sussex  (1533&#150;1593), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22981/', "Henry Radcliffe, second earl of Sussex (c.1507&#150;1557)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22991/', "Radcliffe, Robert")</script>], landowner and administrator, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1534), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13939/', "Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk")</script>. He was brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22993/', "Thomas Radcliffe, third earl of Sussex")</script>. There is no record of his early years. He was married to Honor, daughter and coheir of Anthony Pound of Drayton in Farlington, Hampshire, in February 1549.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's public career began when he and his father declared their support for Mary I in July 1553. He was knighted on 2 October at her coronation. He accompanied his brother to Ireland on the latter's appointment as lord deputy in 1557. He was appointed to the Irish privy council and sat in the Irish parliament as MP for Carlingford in 1559. In the same year he was sent on a mission to Elizabeth I in order to ascertain her resolution regarding Ulster. Also in that year, he corresponded several times with Sir William Cecil, the secretary of state, giving a general account of the state of Ireland. In 1561 he was appointed lieutenant of the colony established in King's and Queen's counties, where he commanded a band of some 200 soldiers, foot and horse, and in 1564 he was employed in putting down the O'Mores. He also defended Maryborough in King's county against an O'Connor attack.<br>
<br>When the third earl of Sussex was discharged from his office in 1564 Sir Nicholas Arnold was appointed head of a commission to investigate alleged corruption in the Irish government. Radcliffe was one of several officers charged by the commission of misuse of some &pound;8000 of soldiers' pay funds. Feeling he was treated with undue harshness, Radcliffe refused to hand over certain records; thereupon he was imprisoned. The English privy council frowned on this action and ordered his release on bond. He left Ireland after this although his offices were not filled until 1566.<br>
<br>On his return Radcliffe settled down on the Hampshire estate inherited by his wife. He had sat in parliament for Maldon in 1555, presumably by family interest, then for Chichester in 1559, when his patron was probably his wife's relative, the twelfth earl of Arundel. However, he may have been absent in this session. By 1571 his influence in Hampshire was enough to gain him election as county MP. In 1572 he sat for Portsmouth, where he had just been appointed (May 1571) warden and captain of the town and castle. He did not speak in this session but served on some half-dozen committees.<br>
<br>Radcliffe spent the rest of his life busy in the affairs of Portsmouth and of the county. He had been constable of Portchester Castle and lieutenant of Southbere Forest in Hampshire since 1560. He was also steward of various crown possessions in Essex. From 1573 he was a JP in Hampshire, commissioner of musters for the county by 1576, and joint lord lieutenant with the third marquess of Winchester from 1585.<br>
<br>The governorship of Portsmouth entailed heavy and diverse responsibilities since it was a major naval base and an important fortress. Radcliffe was in constant correspondence with Cecil and the privy council over details of maintenance of new work. Besides these administrative responsibilities, he gathered and passed on intelligence brought by ships from abroad. He sent out vessels specifically to bring back information from the French or Spanish coasts, and was on a constant outlook for spies and smugglers. In times of war he was the commander of a garrison of several hundred men. During the Armada he dispatched four ships to join Sir Francis Drake. In 1589 he was responsible for supplies and shipping for 1000 men sent to France.<br>
<br>In his county offices Radcliffe was equally busy, examining suspects and grilling recusants (with the assistance of the bishop of Winchester), including one of the Babington plotters. He was responsible, with the marquess of Winchester and the bishop, for the county musters, including their training and equipment. He was of course especially busy in the late 1580s. Although there were disputes with his partner in the lieutenancy, he seems to have won the confidence of the privy council. In 1589 he was awarded the Order of the Garter.<br>
<br>Radcliffe had succeeded his brother, as fourth earl of Sussex, in 1583. The estates were heavily burdened with accumulated debts to the crown, especially those incurred by his brother. In 1587 he wrote a piteous letter to the queen. His income from the inheritance was &pound;450 a year; the annual instalment on debt repayment to the crown was &pound;500. He had to borrow in order to make the payment. He begged the queen to allow him to reduce the payment to the exchequer to &pound;250 a year. He emphasized that since he could not obtain private access to the queen, his request made publicly might well be impeded by his enemies. Whether his petition was granted is not known. This letter plays up the wholly provincial and local character of the earl's public career. His only court office was that of sewer to Mary. The lack of entr&eacute;e or of a patron (after his brother's death) denied him the rewards which public service brought to those who frequented the court. His career is a good example of the conscientious, hard-worked, poorly rewarded servants of the Elizabethan regime on whom the smooth operation of government rested.<br>
<br>Sussex, active to the last, died on 14 December 1593. He was buried with his predecessors in the church at Borham, Essex. He was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22992/', "Robert Radcliffe, fifth earl of Sussex")</script>.<br>
