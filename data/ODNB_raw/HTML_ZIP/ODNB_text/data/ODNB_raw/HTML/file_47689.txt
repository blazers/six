<span class="headword">Micklem,  Charles</span>  (1882&#150;1955), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 17 January 1882 at The Lodge, Herne Hill, London, the fifth of eight sons of Leonard Micklem and his wife, Dora Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weguelin. Leonard Micklem appears to have been a country gentleman of leisure until the 1880s, when (probably because of the demands of his large family) he went into the City as a company secretary. Dora Micklem's father had been governor of the Bank of England. Charles Micklem was educated at Wellington College, and at Hertford College, Oxford. He entered the stock exchange in 1904 as an unauthorized clerk to the brokers Billett, Campbell, and Grenfell. He became a member of the stock exchange in 1909, and by 1912, with much ability but with little capital, he had moved to Cazenove and Akroyds on a half-commission basis. He was made a salaried partner there in 1913 and in the inter-war years he worked closely with another important City stockbroker, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48121/', "Claud Serocold")</script>. The two were responsible for the promotion of Cazenoves &#145;from somewhere in the middle of the first division of stockbrokers to a position at or near the top of the league&#146;  (Kynaston, 99). Serocold, shrewd and able, created introductions and opportunities, while Micklem, detailed and able, realized them. He was &#145;the outstanding stockbroker of the inter war Stock Exchange&#146;  (ibid., 104).<br>
<br>Micklem's parents had originally intended him to follow a military career but medical reasons had made this impossible. Active service in the First World War offered him the opportunity to fulfil that ambition. He served, reaching the rank of major, with the Royal Marine Artillery, howitzer brigade, in Gallipoli and in France; he was twice mentioned in dispatches, and in January 1919 he was awarded the DSO. He also studied, successfully, for a law degree during his military service.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Micklem returned to Cazenove and Akroyds. On 10 November 1920 he married Diana Gertrude May Loyd (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), daughter of Graham Loyd JP. There were two sons and four daughters of the marriage; and from 1930 Micklem and his family lived at Long Cross House, near Chertsey, Surrey. Micklem had the house built and its estate offered him the opportunity to put into practice his interest in farming and agricultural affairs.<br>
<br>Micklem built Cazenove's success on corporate work. Early on he realized the opportunities which lay in the promotion of investment trusts, which enjoyed a revival and greater stability in the 1920s. But he was especially good at building relationships with industrialists and with issuing houses, and in the 1930s he won for his firm its paramount role in company finance.<br>
<br>Micklem had a dry sense of humour and great charm, often hidden under a reserve of severity. It won him many friends in the City, including such influential men as Alfred Wagg, and his contacts extended far beyond his own family, who were also not without sway in the City: two of his brothers were on the board of the mining company Selection Trust, and one of them was much involved in the establishment of Cull &amp; Co., which became a significant finance house; another brother, Robert, became chairman of Vickers-Armstrongs in 1946. As a young man Charles Micklem was a keen athlete, and his charm was best described by his obituarist who noted that he had such a way of defeating his opponents at squash, tennis, or golf that he left them with the impression that they had after all won the game!<br>
<br>Micklem's personal austerity was well known in the firm, and he set high standards of professional and personal conduct for himself and for Cazenove and Akroyds; he made it clear that no member of the firm should do business with any person or institution attached to any taint, however slight, of dubiety. Outside the City he was, again, a much respected figure; a strong sense of duty led him to serve as a JP and as high sheriff of Surrey in 1938. He took a keen interest in Guildford Cathedral and was a generous contributor to charitable causes. He was the largest individual subscriber to the Wellington College centenary fund.<br>
<br>At Cazenoves Micklem took the strain of keeping the firm going during the Second World War, and he saw it through the difficult immediate post-war years. He became senior partner in name as well as in practice in 1947 when Claud Serocold retired. However, by the early 1950s Micklem himself was frail and increasingly remote from his other, younger partners. Micklem retired in August 1954 and died from diabetes at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, on 26 January 1955, survived by his wife. A memorial service was held for him at St Michael's Church, Cornhill, with an impressive City gathering.<br>
