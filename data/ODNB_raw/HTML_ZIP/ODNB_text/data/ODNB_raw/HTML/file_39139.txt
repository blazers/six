<span class="headword">Brude <span class="st"> [Bridei]</span> mac Maelchon</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>586), <span class="occ">king of Picts</span>, was the earliest of seven &#145;historical&#146; bearers of the name Brude in the Pictish king-lists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49277/', "Picts, kings of the")</script>]. That name, not certainly of Celtic origin, was Brude or Bruide in Irish. Its principal Pictish forms, perhaps later than the Irish, were Bridei (known to Bede <i>c</i>.731) and Bredei. Maelchon is sometimes used by modern writers as a nominative, because the true nominative of Brude's father's name is in doubt. Chronologically, he could have been Maelgwyn, king of Gwynedd in north Wales, who died in 547 or 549.<br>
<br>There is no contemporary record of Brude. He was remembered, it seems, for having checked an eastward expansion of Scots into Pictish territory, about 558 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49278/', "D&#225;l Riata, kings of")</script>]. The event is noted laconically&#151;&#145;Flight before Maelchon's son&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.21)&#151;in the annals of Ulster, and more explicitly in later versions.<br>
<br>Adomn&aacute;n of Iona, writing his life of Columba about 700, believed that Columba had travelled at least once to the country of the Picts, by way of the Great Glen and Loch Ness, to visit their king Brude in a fortified residence near the River Ness (the site of the medieval castle of Inverness has been suggested). These chapters of the life are far more concerned with Broichan, a malign magician and the foster father of Brude, than with the king himself. However, one chapter represents Brude as exercising lordship over a king of Orkney, which surely implies considerable sea power. Adomn&aacute;n says nothing of Brude's relations with southern Picts; but Bede (about 731), after drawing a distinction between northern and southern Picts, seems to imply that Brude, &#145;a very powerful king&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 222), had been sovereign over both.<br>
<br>Brude may have been the first king of a Pictish province to claim sovereignty over all the Picts. Certainly he is the first Pictish king to be mentioned by the annalists, but perhaps only because the monastery of Iona, ultimate source of much annal information, had been founded in his reign. Bede believed that it was &#145;the Picts&#146; who had granted the island to Columba. Adomn&aacute;n has nothing to say on that matter. He relates that Brude was initially hostile to the saint, but for the rest of his own life treated him with the greatest honour. He does not suggest that Brude was converted by Columba, or even that he was ever a Christian.<br>
<br>Brude's death is dated by the annals of Ulster to 583, perhaps intended for 586 or 587. The lists say that he reigned for thirty years. The dating of his death, and those of several of his successors, may have been calculated from a regnal list and, if so, cannot claim to have independent authority.<br>
