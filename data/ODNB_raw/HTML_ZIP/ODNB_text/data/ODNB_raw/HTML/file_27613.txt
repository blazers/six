<span class="headword">Townsend,  Joseph</span>  (1739&#150;1816), <span class="occ">geologist and writer</span>, fourth son of Chauncy Townsend MP (<i>d</i>. 1770), a linen merchant and mining speculator, and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1762), daughter of James Phipps, governor of Cape Coast Castle, was born in London on 4 April 1739. He matriculated from Clare College, Cambridge at Michaelmas 1758, and graduated BA in 1762 and MA in 1765. There is an unsubstantiated report that he was elected a fellow of the college. For a time Townsend studied medicine in Edinburgh under William Cullen. He was ordained deacon (London) on 21 December 1763, and showed some sympathy with Calvinistic Methodists, occasionally preaching in the countess of Huntingdon's chapel at Bath. As a preacher, Townsend appeared as &#145;a gaunt, upright, gigantic figure&#146;, having &#145;long arms with which he gesticulated wildly when he was seized with religious fervour&#146;  (Morris, 472). In 1767 he visited Scotland on a mission from Lady Huntingdon. There he was met by a number of &#145;pious and able ministers of the Established Church&#146;. He preached at a small village, Coldstream, and soon thereafter went to Edinburgh, where he preached to multitudes, remaining there for two months  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.410&#150;11). Either in late 1767 or early 1768 he went to Dublin at Lady Huntingdon's request, and on his representing to her &#145;the deplorable state of spiritual destitution prevailing in Dublin, she commissioned them [Townsend and a Mr Shirley] to purchase, build, or hire some sound commodious edifice, for the performance of divine worship, <i>according to the forms of the Established Church</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 2.159&#150;60). Townsend was appointed chaplain to the duke of Atholl in 1769, and in that year and 1770 he visited France, the Netherlands, and Flanders. His first publication, <span class="italic">Every True Christian a New Creature</span> (1765) reflects his religious beliefs, but, as with some of his other works, attracted little notice. At one time it was thought, wrongly, that Townsend's Methodistical tendencies had made him the satiric butt of <span class="italic">The Spiritual Quixote</span> by his neighbour Richard Graves. Townsend became rector of Pewsey, Wiltshire, a living he kept until he died. He also became one of the commissioners of the turnpike roads in Wiltshire, an appointment which earned him the nickname the Colossus of Roads.<br>
<br>Townsend's <span class="italic">Free Thoughts on Despotic and Free Government</span> and <span class="italic">The Physician's Vade Mecum</span> both appeared in 1781, the latter running to ten editions by 1807. Townsend published two influential works on the poor laws. The first of these, <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Poor Laws</span> (1785), though largely forgotten for almost 200 years, was given new life in a 1971 edition. Townsend, who was a friend of Jeremy Bentham, argued in <span class="italic">Observations on Various Plans for the Relief of the Poor</span> (1788) that the existing poor laws &#145;so beautiful in theory, promote the evils they were meant to relieve&#146;  (Morris, 474). Townsend advocated the abolition of outdoor relief for the able-bodied and went on to propose the compulsory establishment of friendly societies to cover the costs of medical treatment and burial of their members. Thomas Malthus acknowledged Townsend's influence on his own thinking, while the political economist J. R. McCulloch considered that &#145;Townsend's ideas were not so much a foreshadowing of Malthus's theory as the theory itself&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>The work for which Townsend seems to have been best known was his <span class="italic">Journey through Spain in the Years 1786 and 1787</span> (1791, with a third edition in 1814). He dedicated the work to the earl of Wycombe. The reviewer for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> blew hot and cold: &#145;Not withstanding our warm approbation of Mr. Townsend's work, justice obliges us to say, that he indulgences himself too frequently in repetitions, and that there is a considerable degree of obscurity in many of his descriptions&#146;; he also complained that there was too much emphasis on chemistry and not enough on natural history  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 1791). J. R. McCulloch describes the <span class="italic">Journey</span> as &#145;one of the best works of the kind that has ever appeared, throwing a great deal of light upon the political economy of Spain, and on the causes of her decline&#146;  (McCulloch, 215). The sight of beggars in Spain also served to strengthen Townsend's views about how best to tackle poverty. The <span class="italic">Journey</span> was followed by <span class="italic">A Guide to Health</span> (1795&#150;6). Both the <span class="italic">Guide</span> and the <span class="italic">Vade mecum</span> enjoyed American editions. Townsend also published a volume of sermons in 1805, and concluded his writing career with <span class="italic">The Character of Moses Established</span> (2 vols., 1812&#150;15). He built up one of the largest fossil collections in Britain and devoted many years to trying to amass evidence to support the Mosaic story of creation. His geological researches led him to form a friendship with William Strata Smith (1769&#150;1839), and he was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of London.<br>
<br>Townsend was twice married, first to Joyce, daughter of Thomas Nankivell of Truro, on 27 September 1773; she died on 8 November 1785. On 26 March 1790 he married Lydia Hammond, the widow of Sir John Clerke; she died in 1812. Townsend died on 9 November 1816 and was buried within the precincts of St John's Church, Pewsey, where a tablet was erected to his memory. He left four sons, Thomas, Charles, James, and Henry, and two daughters, Charlotte and Sophia, from his first marriage. Townsend's obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> claimed pre-eminence for him as &#145;a mineralogist, a fossilist, and conchologist&#146;, and stated that &#145;As a preacher, he was sound in doctrine and consistent in practice&#146;. He was also &#145;one of the principal projectors of, and a very considerable share-holder in, the Kennet and Avon Canal&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). Townsend's <span class="italic">Etymological researches, wherein numerous languages apparently discordant have their affinity traced and their resemblance so manifest as to lead to the conclusion that all languages are radically one</span> was published posthumously in 1824.<br>
