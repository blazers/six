<span class="headword">Scott,  Marion Margaret</span>  (1877&#150;1953), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born on 16 July 1877 at 66 Longton Grove, Sydenham, London, one of the two daughters of Sydney Charles Scott (1850&#150;1926), a solicitor, and his wife, Annie Prince (<i>d</i>. 1942). She grew up in Norwood, south-east London, and inspired perhaps by the concerts at the Crystal Palace decided to train as a violinist at the Royal College of Music, where she studied with Fern&aacute;ndez Arb&oacute;s from 1896 to 1901, gaining her ARCM in 1900. She published a book of poems, <span class="italic">Violin Verses</span>, in 1905. Until the late 1920s she pursued a career as a violinist, forming her own string quartet and organizing concerts of contemporary British music; she was leader of the Morley College orchestra when Gustav Holst was director of music. Her interest in contemporary music extended to that of Paul Hindemith, and she read a paper, &#145;Paul Hindemith: his music and its characteristics&#146;, to the Musical Association in 1930. During the war she published articles in the <span class="italic">Listener</span> on Michael Tippett (1943) and Holst (1944). She remained closely connected with the Royal College of Music all her life, and in 1906 helped to found the RCM Union, a society which enabled former students to keep in touch with each other and the college: she was joint honorary secretary from 1906 to 1937, when she became editor of the <span class="italic">R. C. M. Magazine</span>, until 1944. One of the founders of the Society of Women Musicians in 1911, she served as president from 1915 to 1916.<br>
<br>Marion Scott first met the poet and composer Ivor Gurney (1890&#150;1937) in 1912, when he was a student at the Royal College of Music, and despite the difference in their ages they became close friends. She encouraged him, and after he had enlisted in the army in 1915 corresponded with him at the front, and he sent her his poetry for safekeeping. She was instrumental in getting his first volume of poems, <span class="italic">Severn and Somme</span>, published in 1917, and championed his poetry in her presidential address to the Society of Women Musicians in December 1916, &#145;Contemporary British war-poetry, music, and patriotism&#146;, which was published in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> in March 1917. When Gurney was committed to the City of London Mental Hospital in Dartford in 1922 she remained in close touch, visiting him, and helping to pay his bills, and in 1923 she began to collect his manuscripts, including all that he was writing in the asylum, and persuaded his family to send her any music, poems, and letters in their possession. She began to make plans for publication, but although a few poems appeared in magazines, and <span class="italic">Lights Out</span>, Gurney's settings of six poems by Edward Thomas, was published privately in 1926, it was not until 1938 that the first two of five volumes of fifty of his songs were published, with prefaces by Scott. This was as a result of pressure over several years from Gurney's friend Gerald Finzi. Finzi had first suggested publication in 1925, but he found Scott difficult to deal with, guarding the manuscripts possessively, but too busy, or too inefficient, to make a selection and prepare them for publication. In the end most of the editing was done by Finzi, Herbert Howells, and Howard Ferguson, and they also did most of the work involved in preparing a symposium of articles on Gurney for the January 1938 edition of <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span>. Scott gained full control of Gurney's literary estate after his death in 1937, and she wrote the preface for the third volume of songs, which appeared in 1952. The two final volumes came out in 1959 and 1979.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Marion Scott became the leading British authority on the life and music of Haydn. Her first article&#151;on the chronology of Haydn's string quartets, written at the request of the editor, A. H. Fox-Strangways&#151;appeared in <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span> in 1930, and she went on to prepare an edition of the quartet she had established as the original op.1, no.1: in the introduction she wrote, &#145;Haydn did not <i>invent</i> the string quartet; he <i>made</i> it&#151;an infinitely higher achievement&#146;. Other scholarly articles followed, including two in 1932, the bicentenary of Haydn's birth, in <span class="italic">Music and Letters</span>, and the <span class="italic">Musical Quarterly</span>, on Haydn's visits to England. In &#145;Mi-Jo Haydn&#146; (<span class="italic">Monthly Musical Record</span>, 1939), she analysed the arguments in a dispute over the authorship of a symphony attributed to Haydn's brother Michael, concluding that the first two movements were by Michael, and the finale by Joseph. In &#145;Haydn and folksong&#146; (<span class="italic">Music and Letters</span>, 1950) she argued that Haydn used folk melodies because he was an early collector of folk-song. She prepared an exhaustive catalogue of Haydn's works for the fifth edition of Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1954), but although she planned to publish a book on Haydn she had completed only three chapters by her death, and her only book was <span class="italic">Beethoven</span> (1934), in the <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> series. From 1945 to 1952 she edited the proceedings of the Royal Musical Association. She also collected rare eighteenth-century Haydn editions, a collection which she left to Cambridge University Library.<br>
<br>Although she suffered from ill health for much of her life, and was a semi-invalid for many years following an accident when she was thrown out of a hansom cab in her youth, Scott had great determination. She lived with her parents until her mother's death in 1942, when she moved to Kensington. She died after a long illness on 24 December 1953 at her home, 4 Rutland House, Marloes Road, Kensington, London, and was cremated at Golders Green four days later. She was unmarried. At the time of her death, her election to a fellowship of the Royal College of Music had just been approved.<br>
