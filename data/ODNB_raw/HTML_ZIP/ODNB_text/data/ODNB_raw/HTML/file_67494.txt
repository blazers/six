<span class="headword">Popov,  Dusan</span>  (1912&#150;1981), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born into a wealthy Dalmatian family in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. Although he had a reputation as a playboy, he was educated at the University of Freiburg, Germany. &#145;Dusko&#146; as he was familiarly known, was working in his own country as a commercial lawyer in 1940 when he was approached by an old university friend, Johann Jebsen, to work for the German intelligence service known as the Abwehr. Appalled, Popov had sought help from Clement Hope, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) officer attached to the British legation in Yugoslavia under the semi-transparent cover of passport control officer. Hope advised Popov to co-operate with Jebsen and enrolled him as a double agent with the codename Scout.<br>
<br>When Jebsen suggested that Popov travel to London as a spy, the playboy fell in with his plan, and thus in mid-December 1940 he arrived in Lisbon and made contact with the local SIS station commander, Richman Stopford, who facilitated his flight to Bristol on 20 December. Once in London, responsibility for supervising Popov was passed to the Security Service (MI5) and he was assigned a case officer, William Luke, to help him fulfil his assignment, which included researching the answers to a lengthy Abwehr questionnaire about coastal defences and the location of anti-aircraft batteries. In addition, Popov had been instructed to gather information about the organization dealing with enemy parachutists and Fifth Columnists, and to try to penetrate the staff of Admiral Sir John Tovey, the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet.<br>
<br>MI5 had good reason to trust Popov because upon his arrival he had disclosed the identity of another German spy in England, a Czech serving with the Free French and named Georges Graf. Unbeknownst to Popov, now known to his handler as Tricycle, Graf was also a double agent, having been codenamed Giraffe by MI5. Both Tricycle and Giraffe were to play key roles in a sophisticated deception scheme known as the &#145;double cross system&#146;, in which the performance of a growing number of individual double agents was monitored by a panel of inter-agency counter-intelligence experts chaired by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31420/', "Professor John Masterman")</script>. This group, known as the Twenty Committee because of its roman numerals (xx), co-ordinated the activities of more than forty &#145;turned&#146; spies and effectively took control of the enemy's entire organization in Britain, thus providing a channel for some exceptionally ingenious operations which were intended to mislead the Abwehr, identify more of its spies, reveal its future plans, compromise the enemy's cryptographic techniques, and extract large sums of money from the axis.<br>
<br>Popov returned to Lisbon in January 1941 and then attended a meeting in Madrid with Jebsen, who suggested a second mission to London. On this further visit Popov supposedly recruited his Austrian girlfriend, Lisel Gaertner, and another MI5 contact, Dickie Metcalfe, who were actually double agents, codenamed Gelatine and Balloon respectively. At the end of February 1941 Popov reported back to the Abwehr in Lisbon and received his third assignment, which was to establish a conduit for paying other German agents in Britain. With MI5's assistance Popov constructed an ingenious route, involving the unconscious co-operation of a London theatrical agent, Eric Glass, who purportedly supplied cash to the Abwehr's nominees in England in exchange for the appropriate credit in a bank in New York. Having accomplished this, and thereby enabled another MI5 double agent, codenamed Tate, to be put in badly needed funds, Popov himself flew to the United States in mid-August 1941 to undertake his most important mission, which was to include a survey of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.<br>
<br>In the United States, Popov received minimal support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was suspicious of the self-confessed Nazi spy and disapproved of his exotic lifestyle (which included a tumultuous affair with the actress Simone Simon). Frustrated by the bureau's heavy-handed surveillance, he sailed to Brazil to acquire a transmitter on which he was to open a radio link with Lisbon. He was on board ship, half-way through the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, which gave a special significance to many of the items on his Abwehr questionnaire requesting details of the US navy's installations on Oahu.<br>
<br>Popov returned to Lisbon in October 1942 to receive new instructions from the Abwehr, and then proceeded to London, where, with the help of MI5's Ian Wilson, he developed another network headed by his elder brother Dr Ivo Popov, whom MI5 codenamed Dreadnought. Thereafter the Popovs participated in several deception schemes, intended to mislead the enemy about the allied invasion of Europe, and built an organization that supplied the Nazis with a mass of political and military information, ostensibly from Yugoslav &eacute;migr&eacute; circles.<br>
<br>After the war Popov operated as a British agent in Germany, running a commercial cover for the SIS in Krefeld, and in 1947 married his first wife, Janine. He became heavily involved in the motor industry, importing Peugeot cars into Germany, and in 1955 was appointed general secretary of the European movement. During this period Popov's business affairs became increasingly murky; he travelled extensively in southern Africa and earned a substantial permanent income from Tiny Rowland, the controversial tycoon who headed Lonrho. He also served a prison sentence in Marseilles in 1959, but in 1962 he married a Swedish student, Jill Jonsson, with whom he had twins. After working in Cape Town for a German cocoa company, Popov and his second wife settled in a magnificent home, formerly the bishop's palace, at Opio in the south of France. It was there that he wrote his wartime memoirs, <span class="italic">Spy Counterspy</span>, which were published in 1974. Popov died in Opio, Alpes Maritimes, France, on 10 August 1981, and was survived by his wife.<br>
