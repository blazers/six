<span class="headword">Evans,  Caleb</span>  (1831&#150;1886), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 25 July 1831 at 7 Pullins Row, Islington, the third of five children of John Evans (<i>d</i>. 1846), barrister, and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1848), daughter of George Knight of Headcorn, Kent. He was educated at University College School, London, until 1846, when the death of his father forced him to begin work, initially in a solicitor's office. From 1852 he was (like his elder brother) a clerk in the chancery pay office, until ill health forced his early retirement in 1882.<br>
<br>Evans's involvement with geology began after he attended lectures given in 1855 by, among others, the eminent anatomist Richard Owen. Evans excelled as a collector, and from 1858 specialized in the fossils of the Tertiary formations of the south of England, taking advantage in particular of exposures made in south London by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the course of its major sewerage schemes of the 1860s. He also collected extensively from the Chalk, and, during his annual vacations, investigated the strata of the Isle of Wight, Lyme Regis, Weymouth, Swanage, and Portsmouth. His geological work found formal expression in numerous scientific papers and field-meeting reports, published mainly in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Geologists' Association</span>; the most notable of these were &#145;On some sections of Chalk, between Croydon and Oxtead&#146; (1870), and &#145;Geology of the neighbourhood of Portsmouth and Ryde&#146; (1871). The former paper marks the first English attempt to subdivide the Chalk, an important geological formation in southern England, into zones correlatable with those previously established in continental Europe. Certain fossil crabs that Evans collected from the Lower Tertiary sediments of Portsmouth were subsequently described (by Henry Woodward) as new species. Evans also constructed geological models or relief maps, of England and Wales, and of specific areas therein, by pasting layer upon layer of cartridge paper to achieve the required topography, and then colouring the rock outcrops appropriately.<br>
<br>Because he was an amateur, most of Evans's geological work reached fruition under the auspices of the Geologists' Association. This he joined in February 1859 as one of its earliest and most active members, serving on its general committee for many years, acting as an auditor of its accounts, and leading its members on field meetings. On the strength of his geological work, in 1867 he was admitted as a fellow of the Geological Society of London. Evans never married, but domestically remained part of a tightly knit family, living for many years with his unmarried sisters and brother in Hampstead, where he died at 3 Downshire Hill on 16 September 1886.<br>
