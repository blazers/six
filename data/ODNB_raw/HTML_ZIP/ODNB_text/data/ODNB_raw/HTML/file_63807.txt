<span class="headword">Gittins,  Charles Edward</span>  (1908&#150;1970), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born on 24 January 1908 at Rhostyllen, Esclusham, Wrexham, Denbighshire, the son of Charles Thomas Gittins, a colliery engine fitter, and his wife, Susannah Frances Rabbitt. He was educated initially at Bersham boys' council school and Grove Park county school, Wrexham. His undergraduate years (1925&#150;8) were spent at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated in 1928 with a first-class honours degree in history. The following year he obtained his teaching diploma and took up a postgraduate research studentship from 1929 to 1931 in the same college. He was awarded his MA degree in 1934, his subject being education in the early years of the French Revolution. Proud of his debating prowess, he became president of debates as well as treasurer and president of the students' union. His future wife, Margaret Anne Davies, also born in 1908, was a fellow student who became a teacher. They married on 28 December 1934 and had two children, John (<i>b</i>. 1938) and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1942).<br>
<br>From 1931 to 1938 Gittins was senior history master at St James Grammar School, Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, where his headmaster regarded him as an outstanding teacher. He was also deputy headmaster from 1937 to 1938. He combined his teaching career with lecturing for the Workers' Educational Association (1932&#150;5) and the extramural department of Durham University (1935&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1938 Gittins was appointed assistant education officer in the Durham county education authority, where he headed an investigation particularly pertinent to the period&#151;the relationship between intelligence and undernourishment. In 1942 he was appointed administrative assistant to the county education committee of the West Riding of Yorkshire, where he was responsible for school meals, emergency feeding centres, nursery education, and post-war development schemes. A. L. Binns, the education officer, whose word mattered, counted him among the best ever administrative assistants in his department.<br>
<br>In 1944 Gittins was appointed to the post of director of education in Monmouthshire, where he was responsible for primary and secondary education as it evolved after the major education legislation of that year. Following R. A. Butler's <span class="roman">Education Act</span> each county was required to submit a development plan for the reorganization of school education from a parallel system of elementary and secondary schools to a sequential system of primary, secondary, and further education. The system which emerged under Gittins's direction followed the standard bipartite pattern of grammar and secondary modern schools. He served on the usual variety of outside committees, including the Burnham Technical Committee (1946&#150;53), the Schools' Broadcasting Council (Wales) from 1947, the Welsh committee of the Arts Council (1947&#150;55), and, most important, the Central Advisory Council for Education (Wales) from 1956. He supported the founding of the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and a village college movement in Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>In 1956 Gittins was appointed professor, head of the department, and dean of the faculty of education at the University College of Swansea. As head of department he presided over the expansion of both postgraduate teacher training and in-service courses. He inaugurated diploma courses in educational psychology, special needs, and counselling, areas in which the Swansea department acquired a national reputation. Though he published little himself, he fostered research, and from the early 1960s his department's work on compensatory education acquired international significance. The department's work in identifying the effect on pupils' educational progress of material, social, and emotional disadvantage gained an international reputation. In the same period faculties of education&#151;university departments, training colleges, and local schools&#151;were developing an important role under the aegis of the four Welsh university colleges. Gittins stimulated a comprehensive programme of courses for teachers, including the new master of education degree, and secured the use of a dedicated college building for faculty use. He was a highly effective head of department. His spare, grey-haired, medium-height figure exuded charm and dignity of manner, and inspired respect among colleagues and students. His conduct of committees was crisp and efficient. His colleagues remembered his integrity and courtesy, administrative abilities, and loyalty to them. He was also active in the local community and in the city of Swansea. Brought up a Methodist, he later attended Anglican worship and served as churchwarden in Bishopston, Swansea. In 1964 he was chairman of the arts and crafts committee of the national eisteddfod in Swansea.<br>
<br>Although Gittins had been a member of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales in 1958, his most notable committee work was as chairman of the Central Advisory Council for Education (Wales) from 1964 to 1967. In one of the more significant post-war acknowledgements of a distinctive Welsh education, the Welsh committee was required by Sir Edward Boyle to produce a general report on primary education and the transition to secondary schooling which exactly paralleled that of Lady Plowden's Central Advisory Council for Education (England). Gittins served as the crucial link, as a member of the English committee and chairman of the Welsh. Just as the &#145;Plowden report&#146; is one of the landmarks in primary education in England in the post-war period, so is the &#145;Gittins report&#146;, published in 1967, of central importance in the history of Welsh education, as much for what it symbolized as for what it advocated. <span class="italic">Primary Education in Wales</span> ran to 646 pages and echoed the progressive, child-centred approach of the English committee. Gittins recommended the reorganization of primary education in Wales, with part-time nursery provision from age three, infant schools from five to eight (to be renamed first schools), middle schools from eight to twelve plus, then transfer to the secondary school. There were enlightened recommendations to ease the transition from primary to secondary schools, and a firm recommendation that the class should not form the essential teaching group but be broken down into flexible groupings to meet differing needs, with no streaming. The fixed timetable in junior schools was to be replaced by programmes of work which broke down traditional subject barriers. There was considerable controversy within the committee and in Wales over recommendations to make religious education and corporate worship non-statutory. The report was prescient in recommending ubiquitous teaching of Welsh with the aim of making pupils bilingual by the end of the primary stage. In 1968 Gittins was made CBE for his services to education.<br>
<br>The final phase in Gittins's career came with his appointment as vice-principal of University College, Swansea, in 1967, in which his abilities as an administrator were particularly evident. From 1967 to 1968 he combined this work with the headship of the department of education. Then the mounting problems of universities, both financially after the dramatic expansion of the previous decade, and in relations with students, decreed that he devote himself full-time, deanship of the faculty of education apart, to his duties as vice-principal. In years of unprecedented campus militancy, he was left to take the main responsibility at Swansea for fraught negotiations with students.<br>
<br>Gittins was anxious to become permanent vice-principal, though this involved a break with tradition. Despite prevarication by the principal, the appointment was agreed in the summer of 1970. Shortly afterwards one of his university colleagues suggested a boating trip. It turned to tragedy. In Oxwich Bay, off the Gower peninsula, the boat capsized. Gittins died of heart failure, due to the shock of immersion in the sea, on 6 August 1970 at Singleton Hospital, Swansea. He was cremated and his ashes scattered in the grounds of Bishopston parish church, Swansea. A memorial volume of essays was published in 1972, and a regular lecture in his memory was instituted at the University of Wales, Swansea.<br>
