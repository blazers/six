<span class="headword">Skene,  James</span>  (1775&#150;1864), <span class="occ">friend of Sir Walter Scott</span>, was born at Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, on 7 March 1775, the second son and seventh and youngest child of George Skene (1736&#150;1776), advocate, and his wife, Jean Moir (1740/41&#150;1820), daughter of James Moir of Stoneywood, Aberdeenshire. The family was descended from Thomas, brother of Sir George Skene (<i>d</i>. 1707), a Danzig merchant and provost of Aberdeen, from whom they inherited the Rubislaw estate. George Skene died in the year after James's birth. In 1783 his widow settled in Edinburgh, for the education of her five surviving children, and James attended the Edinburgh high school. When his elder brother, George, died in 1791, he became heir of Rubislaw, and was sent to Hanau, near Frankfurt, to further his education, becoming an accomplished linguist in due course. Upon returning to Edinburgh, he studied law, and was admitted to the Scottish bar in 1797.<br>
<br>A mutual friend introduced Skene to Sir Walter Scott, who was eager to learn about German literature from him. They found that they had much in common, and remained firm friends until Scott's death. Scott wrote of Skene that he was &#145;the only one among my numerous friends who can properly be termed <i>amicus omnium horarum</i>&#146; (&#145;friend of all hours&#146;; <span class="italic">Journal of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 66&#150;7). That year they founded the Edinburgh light horse infantry, of which Skene became cornet. The dedication to Skene of the introduction to <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, canto 4, is charged with reminiscences of their common interests, and J. G. Lockhart's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott</span> (1837&#150;8) draws heavily on Skene's manuscript memoranda of the friendship.<br>
<br>In 1802 Skene revisited continental Europe after the peace of Amiens but had returned to Britain by November of the following year  (NL Scot., acc. 12092, folder 41). George Bellas Greenough, president of the Geological Society of London, was his travelling companion for a time, and Skene became a member of the society. On 11 September 1806 Skene married Jane (1787&#150;1862), youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9848/', "Sir William Forbes")</script> of Pitsligo, sixth baronet (1739&#150;1806). She was the sister of Sir William, seventh baronet, who in 1797 married Scott's first love, Williamina Stuart. Jane Skene, like her husband, was highly respected by Scott, who wrote of her that she was &#145;a most excellent person, tenderly fond of Sophia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 54). Three sons and four daughters of the marriage survived; the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25671/', "William Forbes Skene (1809&#150;1892)")</script>, was to become a noted antiquary and historian. The youngest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25666/', "Felicia Mary Frances Skene")</script>, became a popular religious writer. They lived in Kincardineshire for ten years, making frequent visits to Scott's home, and to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1816 the family moved to Edinburgh, and Skene became an active member of various literary and scientific societies including the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, acting for a long time as the curator of its library and museum. He was an original member of the Bannatyne Club, for whom he edited Spalding's <span class="italic">History of the Troubles in Scotland</span> (1828). In the following year he was appointed secretary to the board of trustees for manufactures in Scotland. In this capacity Skene promoted fine arts in Scotland and in 1835 obtained for the trust casts of the Elgin marbles from the British Museum for use in the training of young artists. In 1820 he undertook the design of the new Princes Street Gardens. He was also secretary to the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland (founded in 1819), a position he held until his death.<br>
<br>The Skenes visited France in 1820&#150;21 and the detailed journal he kept&#151;notably an account of a certain marquis with whom Skene became acquainted and whose ch&acirc;teau in Provence Skene visited&#151;may have been used by Scott for his fictional aristocrat in <span class="italic">Quentin Durward</span> (1823). The content of Skene's journal had a more certain influence on Scott's novel <span class="italic">Anne of Geierstein</span> (1829), while the Jewish element in <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1819) also drew on Skene's earlier continental experiences  (Lockhart, 4.323; cf. ibid., 7.325). In 1829 he produced a series of sketches to accompany the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. Scott had a high opinion of Skene's artistic skill, writing that he was &#145;for a gentleman the best draughtsman I ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 1.301). Skene wrote the article on painting which appeared in Sir David Brewster's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span>.<br>
<br>For health reasons the family went to Greece in 1838, staying for several years near Athens, in a villa built to Skene's own design. He busied himself with art, and is said to have left over 500 watercolours of Greek scenery and antiquities; examples of Skene's art are now in the collections of the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh Central Reference Library, and the National Historical Museum, Athens, as well as other museums in that city. Skene and his family returned to Britain probably in mid-1843 after a special audience with King Otho in April  (letter to Lord Aberdeen, BL, Add. MS 43241, fols. 165&#150;9). He began his final residency in Athens in October of that year, remaining there until June 1845. According to Skene's granddaughter, Zo&euml;, the family thereafter divided their time between Scotland and Leamington Spa before settling in the latter place after several years. In 1850 Skene moved to 28 Beaumont Street, Oxford, where the census of 1851 records him living with his wife and youngest daughter, Felicia. In the early 1860s they moved to Frewin Hall, Oxford, where he died on 27 November 1864. He was buried at St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, where his wife had been interred two years earlier.<br>
