<span class="headword">MacLehose,  James</span>  (1811&#150;1885), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born in Govan, near Glasgow, on 16 March 1811, the eldest son of Thomas MacLehose, a weaver, and Jean McLean. When he was twelve he was apprenticed for seven years to a relative, George Gallie, a bookseller and stationer in Glasgow. While with him he became a close friend of a fellow apprentice in the book trade, Daniel Macmillan. In 1833 he went to London to gain experience with Seeley &amp; Co., booksellers in Fleet Street. When Macmillan was unable to find employment in the south, MacLehose got him a position with Seeleys and they remained close friends for the rest of their lives. MacLehose returned to Glasgow in 1838 and went into business with Robert Nelson. The partnership was dissolved in 1841 and MacLehose continued in business alone, opening a circulating library&#151;the Western Book Club&#151;in the same year.<br>
<br>This was a period of intense religious debate in Scotland and in 1843 MacLehose began publishing religious tracts for seceders. His authors included Dr Hugh Heugh and Dr W. L. Anderson. In 1849 he moved his shop to St Vincent Street, which soon became &#145;the centre round which gathered almost daily, most of the literary and intellectual talent of his city&#146;  (MacLehose, <span class="italic">Glasgow University Press</span>, 246). His book trade concentrated on the ancient world and European theological and literary works, many of which were purchased through London agents. He also acted as bookseller to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Glasgow Faculty of Procurators. He expanded his publishing business to include local and Scottish titles, for example the works of Jemima Blackburn, the wife of the professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, and Thomas Annan, the celebrated Glasgow photographer. A fine bindery was opened in Glasgow during 1862 and two years later MacLehose was appointed bookseller to the university. Macmillan, by then a very successful publisher, offered him a partnership in 1865, which he refused, opening instead a printing shop in Ayr in partnership with his brother Robert McPhail MacLehose (1820&#150;1910), a bookseller in that town. Macmillan's immediately began to patronize the new works.<br>
<br>With his connections in Glasgow, James MacLehose was well placed to succeed Charles Griffin as printer to the University of Glasgow in 1871. His first publication for Professor Hugh Blackburn and Professor Sir William Thomson was a new edition of Newton's <span class="italic">Principia mathematica</span> published in that year. He soon began publishing textbooks and monographs for university staff, numbering among his authors the brothers John and Edward Caird, William Leishman, John Nichol, and John Veitch. The university press of George Richardson in Glasgow was acquired in 1872 and the printing business, which traded as Robert MacLehose, moved from Ayr.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1850 MacLehose had married Louisa Sing, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson; they had three sons and four daughters. He took his two eldest sons, Robert and James, into partnership in 1881. Two of his sons, James and Norman, cemented relations with the Macmillans by marrying daughters of Alexander. Although well known in Glasgow, MacLehose never played an active part in public affairs. He died in Glasgow on 20 December 1885 and his widow died on 13 June 1898.<br>
