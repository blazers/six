<span class="headword">King,  Phillip Parker</span>  (1791&#150;1856), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, born at Government House, Norfolk Island on 13 December 1791, was the third, but only legitimate, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15585/', "Captain Philip Gidley King (1758&#150;1808)")</script>, naval officer and colonial governor. His mother was Captain King's wife, Anna Josepha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coombe (1764/5&#150;1844). Arthur Phillip, governor of New South Wales, was his godfather. He went to England with his parents in 1796, and was educated there at the Revd Peter Thomas Burford's boarding school at Stratford Grove in Essex. Although granted a place at the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, he failed to be admitted there. He entered the navy in November 1807, on the frigate <i>Diana</i>, and after six years of active service in the Bay of Biscay, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean, was promoted by Sir Edward Pellew to lieutenant of the <i>Trident</i> on 28 February 1814. On 29 January 1817 he married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1874), one of the six daughters of Christopher Lethbridge of Madford, Launceston, Cornwall, deputy recorder of Launceston. They had eight children.<br>
<br>Early in 1817 King was appointed to survey the coast of Australia, and was sent out to take command of the <i>Mermaid</i>, a cutter of 84 tons, with eighteen officers and men. He arrived in Port Jackson in September 1817, and for the next five years was engaged, almost without intermission, on the survey. He examined and delineated the greater part of the west, north, and north-east coasts, and laid down a new route from Sydney to Torres Strait, inside the Barrier Reef. In December 1820 the <i>Mermaid</i> was found to be no longer seaworthy, and King was transferred to a newly purchased ship, which was renamed the <i>Bathurst</i>. This was about double the size of the <i>Mermaid</i>, and carried twice the number of men, but the work on which she was employed was essentially the same. King was promoted commander on 17 July 1821, but continued the survey until April 1822. In September the <i>Bathurst</i> sailed for England, arriving in April 1823. King's voyages had made significant contributions to Australian exploration. For the next two years he was occupied with the narrative and the charts of his survey. The charts were published by the hydrographic office, and formed the basis of those used for the rest of the century. His <span class="italic">Narrative of the Survey of the Intertropical and Western Coasts of Australia</span> was published in 1827.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1824, King was elected FRS; he was also FLS. In September 1825 he was appointed to the <i>Adventure</i>, with instructions to survey &#145;the southern coast of South America from the Rio Plata round to Chiloe, and of Tierra del Fuego&#146;. The <i>Adventure</i> was accompanied by the <i>Beagle</i>, commanded by Captain Pringle Stokes, and, after Stokes's death, by Captain Robert FitzRoy. During the four years from 1826 to 1830 the work was carried on with diligence and an exactness which established the reputations of both King and FitzRoy in the very first rank of hydrographers. King was advanced to post rank on 25 February 1830, and in the following November the two ships returned to England. In April and May 1831 King read an account of the results of his voyage before the Royal Geographical Society, and in 1832 published a volume of <span class="italic">Sailing directions to the coasts of eastern and western Patagonia, including the Straits of Magalhaen and the sea-coast of Tierra del Fuego</span>. In 1839 a fuller account of King's voyage was published in the first volume of the <span class="italic">Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle</span>, edited by Captain FitzRoy.<br>
<br>King had no further service in the navy, but returned to New South Wales, where he had already been granted land, settled in Sydney, and entered busily into the sometimes dubious affairs of the colony; he was for many years commissioner of the Australian Agricultural Company, and a member of the legislative council. In September 1855 he became a rear-admiral on the retired list. Following an apoplectic fit he died at his home, Grantham Villa, North Sydney, on 26 February 1856.<br>
