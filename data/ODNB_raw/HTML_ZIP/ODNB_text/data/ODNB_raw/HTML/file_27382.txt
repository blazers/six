<span class="headword">Thorpe,  John</span>, first Lord Thorpe  (<em>c.</em>1270&#150;1324), <span class="occ">baron and administrator</span>, was the son of Robert of Thorpe or Ashwellthorpe, a village south-west of Norwich, and his wife Matilda. His father, who had died by 1304, was a landowner in Norfolk and Suffolk; his mother's parents are unknown, but she was the niece of Richard of Eye, parson of Fundenhall, Norfolk, making it likely that John was of East Anglian descent on both sides. He had a sister Alice and brothers Philip and George. A tenant of the Bigod earls of Norfolk, John Thorpe is first recorded in 1291 as serving the king in Scotland. Some time before 1304 he served in Gascony, and he was regularly summoned to fight in Scotland between 1309 and 1323. He possessed legal and administrative skills as well as military ones. A knight of the shire for Norfolk in 1305, in that year and in 1307 he was a trailbaston justice there and in Suffolk, while from 1299 he was regularly an oyer and terminer commissioner in both shires. He was also employed in assessing and collecting taxes and in organizing food supplies for the king's armies. Moreover he was <i>persona grata</i> at court, becoming on 23 May 1307 steward of the king's household, a position he held until the death of Edward I on 7 July following.<br>
<br>Thorpe had no similar employment under Edward II, but he was among the justices summoned to the latter's first parliament, while on 4 March 1309 he received an individual summons and is regarded as having thereby become Lord Thorpe. In 1310 he received custody of the lands of Roger (IV) Bigod, now in the possession of the crown, to administer them on behalf of two of the king's half-brothers. He went overseas in the king's service at least twice, and also acted as a justice of assize and gaol delivery, as well as continuing to receive numerous commissions, almost always in East Anglia. In December 1311, for instance, he was appointed to enforce the <span class="roman">Statute of Winchester</span>; a year later to assess a tallage; in 1317 to investigate a dispute between the count of Hainault and the men of Yarmouth; and in 1320 to deal with official malpractices in four counties. Regularly a keeper of the peace in Norfolk, he was appointed sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk on 7 June 1320, but was replaced on 12 July. Possibly Thorpe's loyalty to Edward II's regime was becoming suspect. On 30 November 1321 he was ordered to levy the men of East Anglia against rebels, but earlier in the month he had been forbidden to attend the earl of Lancaster's assembly at Doncaster, and in the following June he was briefly arrested as an associate of the rebel Sir William Trussell. But it seems unlikely that he was seriously disaffected, for he continued to be summoned to councils and parliaments, and to Scottish campaigns, probably until his health failed. His last commission was issued on 15 November 1323, and he died on 15 or 16 May 1324. His wife survived him, dying some time before 1346.<br>
<br>John Thorpe married twice. His first wife, named Agnes, who was the mother of his children, died in 1300 or 1301, and by 28 July 1301 he had remarried; his second wife was Alice, widow of William Mortimer of Attleborough, who brought him a number of manors and portions of manors in East Anglia. Thorpe acted alone in 1311 when he endowed a modest chantry at Ashwellthorpe, but in 1322 he and Alice together gave lands to Pentney Priory. However, Thorpe is more often recorded acquiring property than giving it away. The family cartulary records numerous purchases from 1290 onwards. Some represent significant additions to his estates, as when he paid &pound;40 in 1290 for lands, rents, and serfs in three vills in Norfolk and Suffolk, and 220 marks in 1299 for everything two vendors owned in Wreningham. But many were on a very small scale, 30<i>d</i>. for a yearly rent of 3<i>d</i>. from lands in Tittleshall, for instance, and properties of just an acre or two, suggesting that Thorpe was as concerned to consolidate his possessions as to extend them. At his death he was recorded as the lord of sixteen manors or half-manors in East Anglia, with outlying estates in Northamptonshire and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>John Thorpe's heir was his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_27382"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thorpe</span>, second Lord Thorpe  (1293/4&#150;1330)<span class="occ"></span>, who was aged thirty when his father died, and had been married since at least 1316 to Beatrice, daughter of Thomas Hengrave. He was several times employed as a diplomat. On 18 January 1323 he was granted protection to go to the papal court at Avignon, while in March 1324 he was about to go to Gascony with the earl of Kent. Possibly delayed by his father's death, he had arrived by 1 September, and was briefly mayor of Bordeaux following the death of Sir Robert Shirlaund. Following a number of peace-making missions within the duchy he went to Aragon, under a commission of 16 February 1325, to treat for the marriage of Prince Edward to the Infanta Iolanta. The mission failed, and as he returned Thorpe was captured by the Seigneur d'Albret on 11 May, and not released until 16 February 1326. He was back in England by 23 June following, when he was sent on embassy to Scotland. But his captivity may have ruined his health, for he was not employed again, and he died on 8 April 1330. His heir was his fourteen-year-old son, John, whose wardship was granted to the Suffolk magnate Sir Oliver Ingham. Robert was long outlived by his wife, who died on 4 July 1361.<br>
