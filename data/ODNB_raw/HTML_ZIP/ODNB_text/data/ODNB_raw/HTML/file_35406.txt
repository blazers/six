<span class="headword">Paterson, Sir  William</span>  (1874&#150;1956), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born at Roslin, Midlothian, on 5 August 1874, the youngest of the five sons of James Paterson, a managing director, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall. He was educated at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh, then at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, where he took an engineering course. There followed a six-year apprenticeship (1891&#150;6) in a firm of paper mill engineers, James Bertram &amp; Sons, where he remained for a short period as a draughtsman. After a year in the drawing-office of D. and J. Tullis Ltd of Kilbowie, Glasgow, in 1898 he became assistant works manager with Masson, Scott &amp; Co. Ltd of Wandsworth, London.<br>
<br>Early in his working life Paterson realized the importance of water treatment and between 1899 and 1904 he filed several patents. In 1902 he founded in Edinburgh, with just &pound;700 capital and often working alone, the Paterson Engineering Company Ltd, chiefly concerned with the purification of water for all purposes. In 1904 he transferred his offices to Norfolk Street in London, and for some years shared lodgings with two other Scots destined to attain eminence in their professions, John Anderson (later Viscount Waverley) and Alexander Gray. (Both were present in 1952 at the celebration of the jubilee of Paterson's company.) On 16 April 1910 he married Dorothy Isabel (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), daughter of Herbert Frank Steedman, master tailor, of Bournemouth. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Initially Paterson was particularly concerned with developing and patenting improved means of treating water for industrial use, a matter of great importance with the growing development of large manufacturing organizations. Within ten years he was addressing the need to improve the purification of drinking-water, which greatly widened his activities. An early installation was for the Weardale and Consett Water Company's pre-treatment of 2.5 million gallons of water a day to improve its condition before passing through slow sand filters then in general use. Such pre-treatment greatly prolonged the life of the slow filters and obviated the need for large and costly extensions. In 1910 Paterson designed and installed a plant for the complete purification of 4 million gallons pumped daily from the River Severn for the drinking supply of Cheltenham. It was the first plant in Britain to use chlorine for the routine sterilization of a water supply to eliminate pathological bacteria. Paterson was always interested in the prevention of water-borne diseases, and he had extensive researches carried out on the use of chlorine gas for this purpose, either alone or in conjunction with ammonia to form chloramine. This led to important improvements in the method and equipment for applying these reagents for sterilization, and also in the use of ozone for the same purpose.<br>
<br>In 1913 Paterson was asked by the Indian army medical authorities to advise on the most suitable means of purifying the polluted water supplies in general use in India where outbreaks of dysentery and other water-borne diseases were common. A successful demonstration plant built at Poona led to the adoption of his process throughout India, and eventually to the formation of a Paterson company there.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Paterson set up a number of plants for munitions factories, including one with a capacity of 10 million gallons a day for the huge factory at Gretna in Dumfriesshire. The Second World War presented problems in the supply of reliable drinking-water to troops in the field, and a mobile filtration and sterilizing unit was designed which combined light weight and compactness with high capacity and great efficiency. This type of filter was widely adopted by British, American, and colonial forces and was responsible, to a large degree, for the extremely low incidence of fatal outbreaks of water-borne diseases among allied troops.<br>
<br>Paterson's activities resulted in many other important new developments in water treatment. These included the excess lime process of water softening and sterilization for public supplies in which he collaborated with Sir Alexander Houston, then director of water examination in the Metropolitan Water Board, and the use of chlorine gas for inhibiting algal accumulations in thermal electric power-station condenser systems. This method, originally applied in 1922, was adopted worldwide with important consequent fuel economies, estimated at perhaps half a million tons of coal a year in Britain alone.<br>
<br>As a result of his lifelong association with John Anderson, Paterson was asked privately by him in 1938, when, as lord privy seal, Anderson had special responsibility for manpower and civil defence, to devise a form of shelter which would not only be suitable for economical mass production and quick and easy to erect in individual homes, but which would also afford adequate protection against the blasts and flying debris caused by German bombing attacks. A simple sheet-steel air raid shelter, known as the Anderson shelter, was designed and patented by Paterson and Oscar C. Kerrison. The 1940 patent, taken out to prevent commercial exploitation, was immediately presented to the nation. The more than 3 million shelters supplied to the public saved many lives. Paterson was knighted in 1944 for this service.<br>
<br>In 1948 Paterson was elected an honorary member of the Institution of Water Engineers. He donated to them the Whitaker medal and the Alexander Houston medal, to be awarded to the presenters of outstanding papers on the treatment of water supplies. A member of the Royal Sanitary Institute since 1920, he was made an honorary member in 1949, and in 1952 a fellow after it had become the Society of Health. He was also elected an honorary fellow of Heriot-Watt College, a vice-president of the Junior Institution of Engineers, and a life member of the American Water Works Association. He was also a long-standing member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, having joined in 1910 and served on its benevolent fund committee.<br>
<br>In January 1955 Paterson retired from the chairmanship of his company and active participation in the numerous companies comprising the Paterson group. During his career he had taken out more than seventy British patents, many of which presaged improvements only fully developed by the industry years later. &#145;The world history of water purification in the first half of the 20th century conforms closely to the pattern of the developments due to his foresight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Institution of Water Engineers</span>, 496). Paterson died in Westminster Hospital, London, on 9 August 1956, a few days after his eighty-second birthday. His wife survived him.<br>
