<span class="headword">Sylvester,  Albert James</span>  (1889&#150;1989), <span class="occ">political and private secretary</span>, was born on 24 November 1889 in Harlaston, Staffordshire, the eldest of three children and only son of Albert Sylvester, a tenant farmer reduced to the role of farmworker by the agricultural depression, and his wife, Edith, daughter of James Redfern, also from Staffordshire but of no traceable address. He was educated at Guild Street School, Burton upon Trent, and while there studied Pitman's shorthand. After leaving school at fourteen to become a brewery clerk he devoted most of his leisure to perfecting his shorthand and typing, achieving the champion speeds of, respectively, 210 and 80 words a minute. As a young man he moved as a freelance typist to London, where his talents were soon in demand and he became a member, in 1911 and 1912, of the British international typewriting team, which competed (unsuccessfully) with the Americans.<br>
<br>In 1912, on the recommendation of a stranger whom he met on the underground after a concert at the Albert Hall, Sylvester was appointed to the secretarial staff of the royal commission on Indian public services. This took him to the subcontinent and introduced him to work in the official sphere. After the outbreak of war in 1914 he joined the staff of Colonel (later first Baron) M. P. A. Hankey, secretary of the committee of imperial defence. The following year he became the first shorthand writer to record the proceedings of a cabinet committee.<br>
<br>When, in December 1916, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34570/', "David Lloyd George")</script> succeeded H. H. Asquith as prime minister, he at once established a war cabinet secretariat under Hankey, who chose Sylvester as his private secretary. In this capacity he showed such diligence, discretion, and efficiency that at the end of the war he was given the status of a higher-grade civil servant, without having to sit the examination. Immediately after the war he accompanied Hankey to the Paris peace conference, where he continued to work under intense pressure. In 1917 he married Evelyn Annie (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of William Welman, draper and Baptist lay preacher, of Norbiton. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Sylvester's work for Hankey brought him into frequent contact with the prime minister, and in 1921 Lloyd George recruited him to the secretariat at 10 Downing Street. With Lloyd George he attended the Cannes and Genoa conferences, and he was also involved in the tortuous processes leading to the Anglo-Irish treaty in 1921. When, eleven months later, the Lloyd George coalition was brought down, Sylvester stayed on for a time under two Conservative prime ministers, Andrew Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin. But in 1923 he left the civil service and rejoined Lloyd George.<br>
<br>Though Sylvester's chief motive for doing so was that he admired Lloyd George and found working for him exciting, Lloyd George facilitated the move by paying him a higher salary, and also a substantial sum to compensate him for the loss of civil service pension rights. He was given the title of principal private secretary, though in reality that role belonged to Lloyd George's mistress (later his second wife), Frances Stevenson (later Countess Lloyd George of Dwyfor).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Sylvester accompanied Lloyd George on most of his travels abroad, including his controversial visit to Adolf Hitler in 1936, and at home ran the office at Thames House, Westminster, which at the height of Lloyd George's activity as an opposition politician had a staff of more than twenty. Sylvester dealt with his master's enormous correspondence and, when he was working on his <span class="italic">War Memoirs</span> (6 vols., 1933&#150;6), carried out much archival research and interviewing of former colleagues on his behalf. His services were indispensable, and he stayed at his post until Lloyd George's death in 1945.<br>
<br>Any hopes Sylvester may have had that Lloyd George's widow would invite him to be, as it were, joint guardian of the shrine, and to collaborate in work based on the papers that had been left to her, were soon dashed. In 1947 he published a book of his own, <span class="italic">The Real Lloyd George</span>, which has its good points but is on the whole disappointing. In 1975 a selection from his diary appeared, edited by Colin Cross and entitled <span class="italic">Life with Lloyd George</span>, and this is a far more valuable publication. The diary, kept in shorthand, gives a vivid impression of Lloyd George and a detailed account of his life, though unfortunately it covers only the last phase, from 1931 to the end. The full text of the diary is now in the National Library of Wales.<br>
<br>Always at heart a countryman, Sylvester bought during the Second World War 150 acres of farmland in Wiltshire. In 1949 he moved from his London home in Putney to another Wiltshire property, Rudloe Cottage near Corsham, where he cultivated a smallholding, his larger holding being let to a tenant. He spent the rest of his life at Rudloe, becoming a JP (1953) and, in 1962, chairman of the local bench. In old age he took to ballroom dancing for which, at eighty-five, he received the top amateur award, thereby earning himself a place in <span class="italic">The Guinness Book of Records</span>.<br>
<br>Sylvester was well above medium height, clean-shaven, with a high forehead, longish nose, and fresh complexion. His vigorous and humorous temperament came across most effectively in the many radio and television interviews that he gave in his later years. Even when very old and infirm his resilience was remarkable. A visitor to Rudloe would find him slumped in an armchair before a fire that was nearly out, and his first words would be a plaintive &#145;I am very, very ill.&#146; But soon he would be standing erect, throwing logs on the fire and reliving past experiences with strong voice and eloquent gesture. No doubt it was his personality as much as his great professional competence that appealed to Lloyd George.<br>
<br>Sylvester died at St Andrews Hospital, Chippenham, Wiltshire, on 27 October 1989, a month short of his 100th birthday.<br>
