<span class="headword">Auldjo,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1886), <span class="occ">geologist and alpinist</span>, was born on 26 July 1805 in Montreal, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Alexander Auldjo (<i>d</i>. 1821), born in Aberdeen but then a partner in Maitland, Gardner, and Auldjo, merchants, of Montreal, and his wife, Eweretta Jane, daughter of Thomas Richardson of Portsoy, near Banff. She and his infant sister died in 1808. His father retired in 1813 to London, and Auldjo was educated at Atwood's School in Hammersmith, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated as a pensioner in 1823 but did not take a degree. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1827. His father's death in 1821 left him financially independent.<br>
<br>In 1827 Auldjo visited Switzerland and, with the assistance of eight local men, climbed to the summit of Mont Blanc. This was only the fourteenth successful ascent, and his account, <span class="italic">Narrative of an ascent to the summit of Mont Blanc, on the 8th and 9th August, 1827</span> (1828, 1830, 1856), was a classic of alpine literature, a vivid narrative of the pleasures and perils of mountaineering illustrated by Auldjo's own sketches. Later he lived in Naples, where he was acquainted with the archaeologist and literary socialite Sir William Gell. He made his first visit to Vesuvius in 1831, and published <span class="italic">Sketches of Vesuvius, with short accounts of its principal eruptions</span> the following year. The published diary of his visit in 1833 to Greece and Turkey, <span class="italic">Journal of a visit to Constantinople, and some of the Greek islands, in the spring and summer of 1833</span> (1835), was dedicated to Gell.<br>
<br>In the 1840s and 1850s Auldjo lived at Noel House, Kensington, and participated in the scientific, literary, and artistic life of London. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society (1828) and the Royal Society (1840); he joined the Royal Geographical Society on its foundation in 1830. Financial problems forced him abroad in the late 1850s and he settled at first in Florence, then in Geneva. He was acting British consul in Geneva in 1870&#150;71, and unpaid consul from 1872 until his death. His surviving letters to Edward Bulwer Lytton, first Baron Lytton, his friend for half a century, reveal a warm and enthusiastic personality.<br>
<br>In 1860, in Paris, Auldjo married Caroline Hayden, daughter of Joseph Pope Hammet. Two daughters were born but one died in infancy. Auldjo died on 6 May 1886 at his home in the rue des Alpes, Geneva, and was buried at the Ch&acirc;telaine cemetery, Geneva, three days later.<br>
