<span class="headword">Heyworth,  Peter Lawrence Frederick</span>  (1921&#150;1991), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born on 3 June 1921 in New York city, the son of Lawrence Ormerod Heyworth (1890&#150;1954), a rubber dealer, and his wife, Ellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sterne (1891&#150;1927). He was educated at Charterhouse School (1935&#150;9) and, after six years' army service that included a period in Vienna, at Balliol College, Oxford (1947&#150;9), from where he graduated with a second-class degree in politics, philosophy, and economics. He next spent six months at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where his leanings towards German culture and music received the firm grounding that gave his subsequent work much of its character. In 1952 he joined the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>. His ambitions then lay with a career in political journalism or as a foreign correspondent, and his writing remained marked by strongly pro-European attitudes but also a political stance well to the right of centre: he later treasured a signed photograph of Margaret Thatcher. However, tuberculosis, followed by the diagnosis of Addison's disease, set too great a constraint on his energies, which throughout his life were harboured with self-discipline and courage. Music was an enthusiasm, an art for which he never had any formal training, but he now discovered an ability for applying his sharp intelligence to concert criticism.<br>
<br>After moving to <span class="italic">The Observer</span> Heyworth at first wrote concert reviews, inheriting the paper's championship of new music from a predecessor, William Glock, but coming into conflict with his more traditionalist senior, Eric Blom. He succeeded Blom as chief critic in 1955. Now with greater liberty to develop his own critical stance, he made the paper a pioneer in the cause of new music, especially when it was of sufficient intellectual and imaginative energy and was detached from what he saw as insular establishment values. This brought great allegiance to Tippett, little or none to Britten. An article attacking Walton led the composer to strike him with a walking stick at a concert, and it was typical of both men's qualities that this sealed a burgeoning personal friendship in which no quarter was given on either side. Heyworth was one of the first critics to champion Harrison Birtwistle, to whose music he remained loyal throughout his life (he commissioned a David Hockney drawing of Birtwistle, who dedicated the opera <span class="italic">Gawain</span> to him). He also welcomed Glock's appointment of Pierre Boulez as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, writing eloquently of the invigoration of English musical life which this brought about. His lack of musical training denied him technical appreciation of the scores of these composers, and this he always admitted, claiming that instead he could hope to lead the equally untutored reader towards experiences that had excited and moved him. His scrupulous background work, which included assiduous attendance at rehearsals, prepared him well for such a role.<br>
<br>Heyworth's devotion to the German tradition found another strong focus in the Beethoven concerts given in London by Otto Klemperer from the mid-1950s. His admiration led to personal friendship and, mutual trust established, to radio interviews later published in book form as <span class="italic">Conversations with Klemperer</span> (1973). These in turn led to Heyworth's most enduring achievement, the full-scale critical and biographical study of Klemperer which overtook tentative previous plans for a study of music under the Weimar republic. Immensely thorough, alert to political considerations and to the predicament of a Jewish conductor making his career in a Germany turning towards Nazism, the book also recorded a tempestuous, depressive character whose interpretations of new music, especially at the Kroll Opera in Berlin, and of the Austro-German classics were among the greatest of their time. Volume 1 of <span class="italic">Otto Klemperer: his Life and Times</span> was published in 1983; the second and concluding volume was completed after Heyworth's death by John Lucas (1996).<br>
<br>Heyworth was by nature a demanding man, quick to compare aspects of British public life unfavourably with German orderliness, capable of severity to those who fell short of his high standards, from performers and composers to secretaries and waiters. Welcome as his enlivening company always was, these qualities could make him an exacting guest; he was the best of hosts and travelling companions. His highest standards were reserved for himself, and no trouble was too great in the preparation of his weekly article or in the selection of the correct wine at his table. He was a man of deep and perceptive generosity, loyal, thoughtful about his friends' tastes, sympathetic to the problems of others and reticent about his own. In turn he inspired great loyalty and affection. Among his warmest friends was W. H. Auden, whom he met in Berlin in 1964 and who dedicated <span class="italic">City without Walls</span> to him:<blockquote>
<div>At Twenty we find our friends for ourselves, but it takes Heaven<br>
</div>
<div>To find us one when we are Fifty-Seven.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He died in Athens, of a stroke, on 2 October 1991, and was buried in Hinton St Mary, Dorset, on 12 October.<br>
