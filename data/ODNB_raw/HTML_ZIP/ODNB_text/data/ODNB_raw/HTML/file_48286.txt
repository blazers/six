<span class="headword">Constantine III</span> <span class="st"> [Flavius Claudius Constantinus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 411), <span class="occ">Roman emperor proclaimed in Britain</span>, competed during his short reign (407&#150;11) with the legitimate emperor Honorius to be the western Roman emperor. The pressure he exerted on Honorius's government increased its difficulty in controlling Alaric and the Goths, and thus contributed to the sack of Rome in 410. By withdrawing troops from Britain in 407, he also indirectly brought Roman rule in the province to an end, since his officials were unable to maintain their authority. The sequence of events is complex, however, and surviving narratives are incomplete and inconsistent, although they can be reconciled and supplemented by conjecture. The principal narratives are by two early-Byzantine historians, Sozomen <i>c</i>.443 and Zosimus <i>c</i>.500, both of whom used an excellent contemporary account, now lost, written by the Egyptian Greek Olympiodorus.<br>
<br>On 31 December 406, a host of Vandals, Alans, and Sueves crossed the Rhine and poured into Gaul. In Britain the Roman garrison proclaimed Gratianus, a British civilian, as emperor; four months later it deposed him in favour of Constantine, who is said by the contemporary historian Orosius to have been only a common soldier with nothing but his name to recommend him. As a usurper he is conventionally said to have been &#145;gluttonous&#146;  (Gregory of Tours, ii.9) and &#145;unreliable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sidonius</span>, 5.9.1), but he was more energetic and decisive than the legitimate emperor Honorius. Nothing is known of his previous career or connections, except the names of his sons Constans and Julianus, both of them named, like their father, after fourth-century emperors who had been active in Gaul and Britain. It is not stated that these names were assumed only in 407. At his father's accession, Constans was actually a monk; Constantine himself was a Christian. It is quite possible that he was a Briton like Gratianus and his own general Gerontius, but there is no explicit testimony. Nor are the Roman garrison's motives clear. It contained nine mobile units, according to the <span class="italic">Notitia dignitatum</span> (a contemporary list of civil and military appointments throughout the empire), and these nine units may have been largely recruited from Germans and other outsiders; but there were also many frontier units (the <span class="italic">Notitia</span> names forty-six) of varying but inferior quality which were recruited locally. According to Zosimus, the British army feared an attack by the invaders of Gaul, but Constantine's strategy was not to defend Britain alone: in summer 407 he took an army to Gaul, with which he defeated the invaders inconclusively before reinstating the Rhine frontier. However, this initiative was also a threat to the central government, and Constantine's joint commanders-in-chief were defeated and killed by the Goth Sarus, an officer dispatched by Stilicho, the general who dominated Honorius's court in north Italy; but their successors Gerontius and Edobichus (a Frank) forced Sarus to retreat across the Alps. By May 408, even though the invaders were still at large, Constantine ruled Gaul and Britain from his capital at Arelate (Arles).<br>
<br>Stilicho now concentrated an army at Ticinum (Pavia) to recover Gaul with the help of the Gothic king Alaric, but it mutinied and lynched many of his allies in the government; then Stilicho himself was arrested by his rivals and executed on 22 August 408 for appeasing the Goths. Constantine meanwhile had appointed Constans as his deputy (Caesar) and sent him with Gerontius and an army to Spain, where they soon crushed the local resistance led by kinsmen of Honorius. The new regime in Italy, distracted by the problem of controlling Alaric, proved more amenable than Stilicho's. It received an embassy from Constantine, who (like Magnus Maximus) excused his usurpation by saying that it had been forced upon him by the soldiers, and Honorius gave him a purple robe in recognition. In January 409 they shared the consulship, at least in the reckoning of the provinces controlled by Constantine. This was the high tide of his fortunes.<br>
<br>In Spain, Constans replaced the native garrisons of the Pyrenees with German units of his own, the <i>Honoriaci</i>, whose title indicates that they had been raised before the usurpation but it is not known whether it was for service in Britain or in Gaul. Leaving his new wife at Caesaraugusta (Saragossa), Constans returned to Arelate on a visit to his father. Gerontius seized the opportunity to rebel and proclaim an emperor of his own, Maximus, for reasons which are not clear. His rebellion should probably be connected with the disaster of October 409, when the Vandals, Alans, and Sueves forced their way into Spain through the Pyrenees, the new garrisons proving ineffective. According to Orosius, a Spaniard, they actually joined the invaders. Gerontius may have feared supersession when Constans returned with a general called Justus, or he may have simply usurped authority in a crisis, like Constantine himself in Britain. Constantine now sent reinforcements to Spain and promoted Constans to full emperor (Augustus) to command them, but the soldiers went over to Gerontius, and Constans was forced to take refuge in Vienna (Vienne on the River Rh&ocirc;ne). Constantine meanwhile had tried to secure his eastern front by invading Italy; ostensibly he was aiding Honorius against Alaric, and he was probably responding to an invitation from Honorius's general Allobichus, but when Allobichus fell from power and was executed, Constantine was forced to retreat to Arelate.<br>
<br>By 411, therefore, Constantine's position was desperate. Gerontius had invaded Gaul and, after killing Constans at Vienne, was besieging Arelate in the east; Honorius's new and efficient commander-in-chief, the future emperor Constantius III, had crossed the Alps with an army. Constantine's only hope was his other general Edobichus, whom he had sent across the Rhine to collect German allies. First Gerontius was forced to retreat when most of his army deserted him for Constantius, then Constantius besieged Arelate himself. Edobichus attempted to rescue Constantine, but his army fell into an ambush; and when Constantine heard that he was dead, he tried to forestall his own death by abdicating and having himself consecrated as a Christian priest. Arelate now surrendered to Constantius, who sent Constantine and his younger son Iulianus back to Italy under a promise of safe conduct, but the party was intercepted by order of Honorius; the two prisoners were executed 30 miles from Ravenna; Constantine's head was stuck onto a pole and arrived (at Ravenna presumably) on 18 September 411.<br>
<br>Constantine was the last Roman emperor to rule Britain. Gerontius had incited &#145;the barbarians in Gaul&#146; against him when he rebelled, probably in autumn 409, and the resulting loss of Spain and most of his army made Constantine unable to resist &#145;the barbarians from across the Rhine&#146;. Both terms are used by Zosimus, and it is not clear whether he means the same tribes by both; nor is it clear whether they were the Vandals, Alans, and Sueves <i>before</i> they crossed the Pyrenees, or such of them as did not invade Spain, or other tribes which invaded Gaul in their wake (notably the Franks, Alamanni, and Burgundians), or even Saxons who invaded Britain. Zosimus adds that these attacks now:<blockquote>forced the inhabitants of Britain and some of the tribes in Gaul to secede from Roman rule and to be independent, obeying Roman laws no longer. And so the Britons took up arms, and risked their lives to free their own cities from the barbarians who were attacking them; and the whole of Armorica [Brittany] and other Gallic provinces copied the Britons by freeing themselves in this way, expelling the Roman officials and establishing whatever government they wished. (Zosimus, vi.5.2)</blockquote>What this all meant has been much debated by modern scholars, but since Constantine's is the last Roman imperial coinage to reach Britain, it follows that the inhabitants of Roman Britain, by shaking off the usurper for themselves, did not pass once more under the control of the central government. This in any case had more pressing problems of its own in Gaul and Italy, as Honorius admitted <i>c</i>.410 by his famous advice to the cities of Britain that they defend themselves.<br>
