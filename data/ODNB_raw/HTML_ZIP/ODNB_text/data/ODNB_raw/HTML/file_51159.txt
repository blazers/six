<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Savage,  Michael Joseph</span>  (1872&#150;1940), <span class="occ">trade unionist and prime minister of New Zealand</span>, was born on 23 March 1872 at Tatong, near Benalla, Victoria, the eighth and youngest child of Richard Savage (1830&#150;1908), a small farmer, and his wife, Johanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hayes (1838&#150;1878). His parents were Irish Catholics who had emigrated to Victoria in 1856 and 1857 only to find a harsh and impoverished life, a constant struggle against poor soil and searing summer heat. Savage's mother died when he was five; his sister Rose (the eldest child and only surviving daughter) brought him up but she herself died in childbirth in 1891; his brother Joseph died later the same year. Savage added his brother's name to his own. Later, in New Zealand, his friends knew him as Joe, but to the public he was Micky Savage. The hardship and tragedies of boyhood did much to shape the concerns of the future Labour leader.<br>
<br>After five years' schooling and two years' helping on the farm, Savage worked for seven years in a store in the small settlement of Benalla; he attended night classes at the high school and was active in the fire brigade and other community activities. There followed seven years as a station hand in New South Wales, during which he became a member of the General Labourers' Union, then in 1900 he joined his brother William at the North Prentice gold mine near Rutherglen in Victoria. There he became a member of both the local miners' union and the Political Labour Council of Victoria. The Rutherglen mines closed in 1907 and Savage, having read of the progress made by the workers in New Zealand under the Liberal government, and encouraged by his friend Paddy Webb who was already there, crossed the Tasman on the <i>Manuka</i>, arriving in Wellington on 9 October 1907 with 1 shilling in his pocket. He was thirty-five, a short, strong man, well read in the radical writers of the time, especially the Americans Henry George and Edward Bellamy, a courteous and matter-of-fact public speaker with a growing capacity to win his audience, and gifts as a political organizer.<br>
<br>Savage spent six months cutting flax in the Manawatu swamp before moving to Auckland. There he boarded with Alf and Elizabeth French and their children. Savage, who never married, was to live with them until his death. He found a job as a cellarman at the Captain Cook brewery in Newmarket and was quickly caught up in union activities and as a member of the Auckland Socialist Party, making his mark as an organizer and as the party's most active soapbox orator. In 1911 he stood for parliament and, although unsuccessful, gained a broad base of support, significant at a time when the labour movement was deeply splintered. The defeat of militant unionism in the Waihi miners' strike of 1912 and the widespread waterfront disputes the following year convinced most labour leaders that industrial confrontation would not work and that they must try political action. The First World War brought further division but in July 1916 the New Zealand Labour Party was formed and Savage became a leading speaker at its conferences.<br>
<br>In April 1919 Savage was elected to the Auckland city council, serving for four years, and to the Auckland Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. Although he retired from the latter in 1922, he was re-elected in 1929 for a further six years, an experience that gave him an acute grasp of the impact of the depression on the Auckland poor. At the end of 1919 he was elected MP for Auckland West; he held the seat for the rest of his life, and after the election of 1922 he became deputy leader of the parliamentary party. Labour increased its support over the next ten years but its leader, Harry Holland, an able but embittered socialist, had little appeal to the voter and support was largely confined to the cities. Following Holland's sudden death, on 8 October 1933, Savage succeeded him as leader. In place of socialism he offered&#151;in cloudy but reassuring phrases&#151;practical humanitarianism and the revival of the capitalist economy through state control of the monetary system. In the election of 1935 the government had clearly run its course, the right was divided, and Savage led Labour to a sweeping victory.<br>
<br>Dominated by Savage, Peter Fraser, and Walter Nash (an Australian, a Scot, and an Englishman), and benefiting from an improving world economy, the new government moved rapidly to undo the cuts of the depression, to increase wages and pensions, and to introduce a large public works programme which included building state houses. The 1938 <span class="roman">Social Security Act</span>, which extended benefits and introduced a virtually free national health service as an integrated and comprehensive system, shaped the country's welfare state for fifty years. The government increased its vote in the election of 1938 but internal division, the coming of the Second World War, and Savage's ill health overshadowed his remaining time as prime minister.<br>
<br>By 1939 the cancer from which Savage had been suffering for some years was seriously affecting him and his mastery of caucus. John A. Lee, prominent among a group of Labour parliamentarians impatient with the pace of reform and swayed by Douglas Credit ideas, was ambitious to succeed Savage. Showing a staggering lack of judgement, in a party that prized loyalty, he chose to attack the failing prime minister. Savage hung on grimly, determined to see Lee defeated. At the party conference, held at Easter 1940, Lee was expelled from the party. Little more than a day later, on 27 March 1940, Savage died in Wellington. He was interred at Auckland's Bastion Point on 31 March. Peter Fraser, who succeeded him as Labour leader and prime minister, proved an outstanding wartime leader and a man of considerable political skills. But he never achieved Savage's remarkable popularity. For most New Zealanders Savage epitomized the idea of a decent society, shaped by the ideals of equality and material security for all. For thirty years or more his photograph hung in the homes of countless Labour voters.<br>
