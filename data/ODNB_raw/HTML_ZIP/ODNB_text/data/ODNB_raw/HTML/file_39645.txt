<span class="headword">Nuttall,  William</span>  (1835&#150;1905), <span class="occ">promoter of the co-operative movement</span>, was born in Manchester in December 1835, the son of Charles Nuttall, who was a cotton weaver, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ratcliffe. He was baptized on 27 March 1836, and grew up in Manchester, Saddleworth, and Oldham. He married Ann Newton on 25 September 1862 in Prestwich; they had six children.<br>
<br>Apprenticed as a shoemaker, Nuttall worked in that trade at Greenacres Hill, Oldham. In the early 1860s, however, he became interested in the co-operative movement, becoming secretary of the Greenacres Hill Co-operative Society in 1862. From 1863 to 1865 he was the first paid permanent secretary of the Oldham Equitable Co-operative Society. He then became an accountant for the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Society (later the CWS). He was a member of the latter's general committee on two occasions (1865&#150;6 and 1876&#150;7) and its cashier for two years (1868&#150;70). When the Central Co-operative Board was organized in 1870, Nuttall became its secretary. Nuttall was a friend and supporter of George Jacob Holyoake (1817&#150;1906), who was one of the chief propagandists for secularism and the co-operative movement. In 1871 Holyoake's publication, <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, promoting his interest in secularism, was being issued on an irregular basis. Nuttall headed a publishing committee that attempted to support and publish <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span> on a regular monthly schedule.<br>
<br>Nuttall travelled throughout Britain in the 1870s, in both an official and a private capacity to promote the co-operative movement speaking at many local and regional meetings. He attended and actively participated in all the co-operative congresses down to 1883. Nuttall founded the Co-operative Printing Society and was also one of the founders of the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span> and an early editor and contributor to its columns. He edited the CWS <span class="italic">Annual</span> for 1883 and prepared the 1884 edition.<br>
<br>Nuttall became one of the principal figures in the formation of limited liability cotton-spinning companies in the Oldham district, the so-called &#145;working-class limiteds&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>); and by 1875 he was involved with at least twelve such businesses. Down to 1883 he was also promoting similar companies in coalmining, iron production, and paper manufacturing. Yet Nuttall invested much of his own money in such ventures, primarily in the Manchester area, and he lost heavily. This was undoubtedly one of the reasons why he decided to leave England. Before he left he was presented with testimonials by activists in Manchester, London, and Newcastle, reflecting his contribution to the co-operative movement.<br>
<br>In December 1883 Nuttall emigrated with his wife and five of his children to Australia, settling in Melbourne, where he worked as cashier and secretary for the Equitable Co-operative Society. He was not particularly successful in promoting co-operation in the Melbourne region, and he and his wife returned to Manchester about 1900. However, he was unable to regain his former prominent position in the movement. He attended meetings, including the co-operative congresses of 1901&#150;4, and visited friends and fellow co-operators but was no longer a major influence. He died of heart disease at his home, 21 Brookfield Road, Crumpsall, Manchester, on 26 October 1905; he was survived by his wife. His funeral at Manchester southern cemetery on 30 October was attended by only a few members of the movement.<br>
<br>According to contemporaries, Nuttall had a forceful, independent personality, and he was often blunt and opinionated. One observer noted that his &#145;restlessness&#146; kept him moving to new challenges and jobs  (<span class="italic">Oldham Co-operative Record</span> 4, 1898, 110). According to Holyoake he had &#145;the genius of figures&#146;  (p. 85) and he made important contributions to the early development of the co-operative movement in Britain.<br>
