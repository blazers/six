<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Tom Nefyn, Tom  Nefyn-Williams]</span>  (1895&#150;1958), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales</span>, was born on 23 January 1895 in Fronolau, Boduan, Caernarvonshire, the son of John Thomas Williams (1867&#150;1921), a carpenter by trade but a poet by delight, and his wife, Ann Hughes (1868&#150;1905). The family moved to the Nefyn area in Caernarvonshire, and then settled in Bodeilas in the vicinity of Pistyll, where he was brought up. His mother died on 23 October 1905 and his father subsequently remarried. He left the primary school in Nefyn in 1909 to work at the Eifl granite quarry, where he had a miraculous escape when a stone fell on his fellow quarryman Robert Jones, of Llithfaen, killing him. Though he identified himself with the locality to the extent that he was known as Tom Nefyn or Tom Nefyn-Williams, the experience in the quarry unnerved him so much that he decided to emigrate to Star City, Canada. However, war was declared: he enlisted with the Royal Welch Fusiliers and saw action in the Dardanelles, where he caught enteric fever. He saw further service in the Middle East and was hospitalized in Egypt. Williams returned to Britain from the war in 1919 as a convinced pacifist, and addressed meetings for the Fellowship of Reconciliation. He produced two pamphlets, one in Welsh, <span class="italic">Dagrau Cain&#151;dagrau Crist</span> (&#145;The tears of Cain&#151;and tears of Christ&#146;) (1935), and the other <span class="italic">At Sulva Bay: what a Soldier Learnt at Gallipoli</span> (n.d.).<br>
<br>Williams's evangelistic fervour convinced him of the need to hold open-air meetings and, starting at his home base in Nefyn, he never wavered from the itinerant ministry, resuming the traditional style of pastoral ministry when he came back to Ll&#375;n after the Second World War. As an evangelist he possessed a pleasing tenor voice which attracted audiences. In 1921 he entered the Rhondda Bible School which met in Ynys-hir, and then entered the colleges of the Presbyterian connection in Bala and Aberystwyth. Ordained in 1925, he accepted a call to Ebeneser Chapel in the mining village of Tumble in east Carmarthenshire. He married Ceridwen Roberts Jones of Coed-poeth, near Wrexham, in 1925 and they had three children.<br>
<br>Williams began to seek those who had left the chapel because of their socialist views, and he took up social concerns, such as bad housing. The houses which he visited in High Street belonged to the coal company. After the survey he contacted the company managers and shareholders detailing the condition of the houses. He sided with the miners in the 1926 strike and introduced a great deal of innovation to the chapel services, such as a small orchestra and the involvement of young people. The chapel flourished under his ministry, with often 200 people attending the weekly devotional gathering. All this created controversy and opposition with the local presbytery of south Carmarthenshire, and three out of eight elders of Ebeneser resigned. In 1928 he produced a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Y ffordd yr edrychaf ar bethau</span> (&#145;The way I look at things&#146;), which expressed his unorthodox, almost humanistic, theology questioning the denomination's Calvinistic confession of faith. This became a source of acute bitterness within the South Wales Association. The matter dragged on from one association meeting to another with the result that finally a resolution was passed at Nantgaredig on 28 August 1928 expelling him on the grounds of heterodoxy. His farewell service at Tumble on 9 September 1928 attracted 4000 people to an open-air service at the local football ground. A testimonial of &pound;700 helped him to attend Woodbrooke settlement, Birmingham, and his followers in Tumble established a non-denominational chapel called Llain-y-Delyn. They were disappointed that he did not stay with them, and that within three years he had returned to the Presbyterians, accepting a call in 1932 to Rhosesmor in Flintshire. He moved to Bethesda, a slate-quarrying town, in 1937, then to Pwllheli in 1946, and finally in 1949 to Edern. During the period 1932 to 1958 he became a preaching celebrity, a Welsh Billy Graham travelling extensively and drawing sizeable congregations.<br>
<br>Williams kept his friendship with many of the Christian socialists, and his second son was baptized in Bethesda with the assistance of the Labour MP George Lansbury, but he declined an invitation to stand as a Labour Party candidate for the Cardiganshire constituency in the 1929 general election. Williams wrote a great deal in the religious press, and his autobiography <span class="italic">Yr ymchwil</span> (&#145;The research&#146;) (1949) has been invaluable for historians of Welsh Presbyterianism. A maverick within Welsh nonconformity, more popular with lay people than most of his ministerial contemporaries, Williams had a saintly appearance and epitomized the gifted communicator. He died suddenly after a Sunday evening preaching service at Rhydyclafdy, near Pwllheli, on 23 November 1958, and was buried at Edern on 26 November. His funeral was the largest to be held in the Ll&#375;n peninsula during the post-war period.<br>
