<span class="headword">Jenkins,  Edmund Thornton</span>  (1894&#150;1926), <span class="occ">composer and jazz musician</span>, was born on 9 April 1894 in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, one of eight sons and three daughters of Daniel Joseph Jenkins (1862&#150;1937), Baptist minister, and his wife, Lena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James (1865&#150;1912). His father's efforts for his fellow African-Americans placed the family in a musical environment, for practical tuition at the Jenkins Orphanage (founded in 1891) included music. His father, with a band including three of his sons, went to England in 1895, seeking support by playing in the streets. He was assisted by Sir George Williams, the founder of the Young Men's Christian Association, and visited orphanages including George Muller's in Bristol and Charles Spurgeon's in Stockwell, London. By 1898 Daniel Jenkins was importing instruments from Abraham Collins of London.<br>
<br>Edmund Jenkins took piano and violin lessons, attended Charleston's &eacute;lite black school the Avery Institute, and in 1908 went to Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia. His English tutor, later dean of the college, was the historian Benjamin Brawley; the music tutor Kemper Harreld directed the college orchestra in which Jenkins played both violin and clarinet. He played the cornet at the First Congregational Church and participated in Atlanta concerts. He also played in and managed orphanage bands touring the eastern USA every summer.<br>
<br>Jenkins left Atlanta in May 1914 to play at the Anglo-American Exposition in London. His band (billed as the Famous Piccaninny Band) had its contract extended (and posed for six postcards, some utilized by the visiting South African journalist Solomon Plaatje). The exhibition closed in September 1914, but Jenkins remained in London to start seven years at the Royal Academy of Music. He studied the clarinet with Edward Augarde, the piano, and composition with Frederick Corder. His successes included a two-year orchestral scholarship and a medal for singing in 1915, a medal for clarinet playing in 1916, three medals (for clarinet, piano, and singing), the Prescott prize for composition in 1917, the Charles Lucas Prize in 1918, an extension to his scholarship, work as a sub-professor of the clarinet, the Battison Haynes prize, and the Ross scholarship in 1920. His songs and instrumental compositions were played with colleagues including Dorothy Howell, Jean Pougnet, Winifred Small, and John Barbirolli. Other friends included Caribbean students. They presented a concert of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's music at the Wigmore Hall in December 1919. His own <span class="italic">Folk Rhapsody</span> (later renamed <span class="italic">Charlestonia</span>) was also performed; the orchestra included Pougnet, Small, Barbirolli, and four members of the Southern Syncopated Orchestra, an all-black band whose leader, Will Marion Cook, associated with Jenkins in London.<br>
<br>Jenkins left the academy as an associate (ARAM) in 1921 and participated in the Pan-African Congress in London the same year. He then led a jazz dance band that made several records; his pianist was Jack Hylton. He also provided opportunities for the future band leader Ted Heath. He visited America for only a few weeks in the summer of 1920, yet his 1921 discs reveal a mature jazz improvising stylist. Jazz was now the fashion, and black musicians were in vogue. Jenkins, alert to Afro-American folk traditions, had gained an additional feel for negritude thanks to his contacts with Africans, Caribbeans, and British-born blacks during his years in England.<br>
<br>Performing paid well, and took Jenkins in 1922 to Paris, where he worked at the Club Danou, and then to Belgium. Back in London his associations with American visitors included the concert tenor Roland Hayes, the dancer Minnie McDowell, the singer Florence Mills, the pianist Lawrence Brown, and the composers Will Vodery and James P. Johnson. He also knew the Trinidadian cricketer Learie Constantine and John Alcindor (he served on Alcindor's African Progress Union committee and was active in the 1923 Pan-African Congress). Jenkins went to New York to work with Cook in late 1923, tried a partnership with Vodery, failed to obtain financial support, and, disillusioned, returned to Paris in October 1924. He then worked on a musical play (<span class="italic">Afram</span>, set in South Carolina), led the International Seven band in Paris and Italy, started a music-publishing enterprise, and had his <span class="italic">Charlestonia</span> presented in Belgium in 1925. Two compositions won prizes in New York, and he joined SACEM, the French society for composers, but the grind of club work left him tired and his compositions were not all fully orchestrated when in July 1926 he was admitted to the H&ocirc;pital Tenon in Paris. He died there on 12 September 1926, possibly from tuberculosis. His body was shipped to Charleston and was buried on 30 September at the Humane Friendly cemetery. His music was sent to America where his younger sister Mildred later approached Boston and New York musicians, but failed to attract interest. George Gershwin, who had met Jenkins in Paris, later adapted the play <span class="italic">Porgy</span> (which played London in 1929 with Jenkins Orphanage personnel) and in 1935 created <span class="italic">Porgy and Bess</span>. It was a fusion of African-American music and society with a European orchestral tradition. When in 1996 <span class="italic">Charlestonia</span> was recreated by Vincent Plush (and recorded) it became clear that Jenkins had already achieved that feat between 1919 and 1925.<br>
