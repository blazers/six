<span class="headword">Fairfax, Sir  Guy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1495), <span class="occ">justice</span>, came of a Yorkshire family, the third son of Richard Fairfax of Walton and his wife, Anastasia, daughter of John Carthorpe. From his father he inherited the manor of Steeton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where he built a castle. At first he seems to have been occupied with purely local business, and in April 1451 was granted an annual fee by the powerful Percy family. He was a commissioner of array for the West Riding in 1435, a justice of the peace there from 1456, and in 1460 he was commissioned to inquire into lands in that riding possessed by the recently attainted Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460). One of his colleagues was Sir William Plumpton (<i>d</i>. 1480), whose counsel he was in 1469, and in 1483 he acted as an arbitrator in the great dispute over the Plumpton inheritance (as he had done earlier for Durham Priory in 1431). Common serjeant of London (1456&#150;9), under-sheriff (1459&#150;60), and counsel to the City (1460), he was retained by the London mercers in 1455&#150;6 and 1457&#150;8, by the goldsmiths in 1468&#150;9 and 1472&#150;3, and by St Augustine's, Canterbury, in 1468&#150;9. During the 1470s he became a member of the northern affinity of Richard, duke of Gloucester, serving him in a legal capacity. He first appears in the year-books in Michaelmas term 1463 as a serjeant and member of Gray's Inn. On 28 April 1467 he was appointed king's serjeant and in 1476&#150;7 served as recorder of York. Regularly a justice of assize in the palatinate of Durham from 1457, and a justice of the peace in a number of counties from 1471, he also developed a close association with the duchy of Lancaster&#151;as second justice at Lancaster in 1471, deputy chief steward and a member of duchy council in 1476, and chief justice at Lancaster in 1480. In these capacities he became actively involved in determined efforts to restore law and order in Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1477 Fairfax was appointed a justice of the king's bench. In this office he won an honourable reputation, and on 8 October 1482 received a grant of 100 marks yearly in addition to his salary. He continued to serve as a justice of the king's bench and chief justice of Lancaster under Edward V, Richard III, and Henry VII. He certainly enjoyed a long and highly successful legal career, whether the reigning monarch was of the house of Lancaster, York, or Tudor, and he firmly established the fortunes of his family. On numerous occasions he served on commissions of oyer and terminer, in counties ranging from Yorkshire to Cornwall, and during his last decade figured particularly as a justice of assize in the midlands. On at least six occasions between 1470 and 1495 he was summoned by writ to attend parliament, while in his native county of Yorkshire he was much in demand as a trustee for, and executor of, the wills of neighbouring landed families. With his wife, Isabel, a daughter of Sir William Ryther, Fairfax had four sons and two daughters. He died in 1495. Two of his sons&#151;William, the eldest, who became a justice of common pleas in 1510, and Thomas, a serjeant in 1521&#151;ensured the family's continuing prominence in the legal profession.<br>
