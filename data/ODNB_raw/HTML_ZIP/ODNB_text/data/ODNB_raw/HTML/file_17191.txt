<span class="headword">Lundgren,  Egron Sellif</span>  (1815&#150;1875), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Brunkerberg, Stockholm, Sweden, on 18 December 1815, the sixth child of Erik Lundgren (<i>d</i>. 1840&times;49?) and his wife, Maria Elisabeth F&aring;hreus (<i>d</i>. 1846). He trained at the Tekniska H&ouml;gskola (College of Technology) in Stockholm and, from 1832, at the gun foundry at Finsp&aring;ng, but he decided to change careers and in 1835 began to study at the Kungliga Akademien f&ouml;r de Fria Konsterna (Royal Academy of Fine Arts) in Stockholm under A. J. F&auml;gerplan. In 1839 he went to Paris, where he trained for two years under L&eacute;on Cogniet. With a scholarship from the Kungliga Akademien in Stockholm he then travelled to Switzerland and Italy, settling in Rome with a group of Scandinavian artists led by Bertel Thorvaldsen. In 1848 he was conscripted into Garibaldi's Guardia civica but escaped to Spain in March 1849, leaving behind an illegitimate son, Luigi, and the boy's mother, Eleonora Gonzales. When his travel grant expired he decided to develop his watercolour technique abroad rather than to return to Sweden to take up a professorship.<br>
<br>In 1852 Lundgren met the English artists John Phillip and Francis William Topham in Seville; on their advice he went to England in 1853 and was introduced to Thomas Oldham Barlow, who later engraved many of his works. Lundgren concentrated on watercolour painting in England, thereafter producing few pictures in oil. His work was shown to Queen Victoria, for whom he completed over thirty theatrical scenes in watercolour illustrating many of Charles Kean's Shakespearian and other productions. He also painted private royal events, including <span class="italic">The Marriage of the Princess Royal</span> (which took place on 25 January 1858), and two military occasions (Royal Collection) for the queen. This royal patronage assisted his career and he established himself in a large studio in London. After a visit to the portrait painter Francis Grant at Melton, he was invited to paint for the earl of Wilton at Egerton Lodge, for the Coventry family, and for the Exeter family at Burghley; at Badminton he drew four large oval pastels of the sons of the eighth duke of Beaufort.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1858, with a letter of recommendation from Queen Victoria, Lundgren was sent to India by Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons; he reached Calcutta on 20 March. He accompanied the commander-in-chief, Lord Clyde, on his journey of reoccupation after the Indian mutiny, making numerous studies of camp scenes, Sepoy prisoners, and soldiers after the fall of Oudh. His portraits included those of Lord Clyde, Sir William Mansfield, the king of Oudh, and the captured Chinese former governor-general, Ye. He made studies to illustrate a book on the mutiny (which was never published), and his sketches were sent back to England for use by Thomas Jones Barker in his oil painting <span class="italic">The Relief of Lucknow, November 1857</span>. The majority of Lundgren's Indian sketches were acquired from Agnews by Sam Mendel of Manley Hall, Manchester. (They were sold after Mendel's death at Christies on 16 April 1875.) Barker's completed oil painting and Lundgren's sketches were exhibited in London from 1 May 1860: the oil was damaged and destroyed in the Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, during the Second World War; a smaller version is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Lady Canning, wife of the governor-general of India, described the sketches to Queen Victoria as &#145;very rough but full of cleverness&#146;  (Royal Archives, Z 502/55), and on Lundgren's return from India in April 1859 the queen acquired over thirty of them. In September 1859 she invited the artist to Balmoral Castle, where he spent over three weeks painting Scottish scenes and making studies at a highland gathering (Royal Collection; Nationalmuseum, Stockholm).<br>
<br>Lundgren visited Stockholm and Oslo in 1860 before travelling to Cairo in November 1861, where he shared a studio with Frank Dillon and George Price Boyce. In 1862 he was made a knight of the order of Vasa by Karl XV, king of Sweden, and in the same year exhibited two works at the Royal Academy. He was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1864 and became a full member in 1865; between 1865 and 1875 he sent fifty-eight watercolours to the society's winter exhibitions and thirty-five to the summer exhibitions at the Pall Mall East Gallery in London. He visited Italy in 1865 and returned to Seville for the winter of 1867&#150;8, and to England in the spring of 1868. He settled in Stockholm with his brother, Mildhog, in the autumn of that year and there received commissions from the Swedish royal family. A talented letter-writer, Lundgren was described by J. L. Roget as &#145;a gifted artist with keen perceptive and poetic eyes&#146; and a style &#145;easy, pure, elegant, charming, pleasing, humorous&#146;  (Roget, 2.409). He wrote <span class="italic">En m&aring;lares anteckningar</span> (&#145;A painter's notes&#146;), published in 1873&#150;9, which included extracts from his journals and letters.<br>
<br>Lundgren died of apoplexy on 16 December 1875 at 4 Oxtorget, Stockholm; he was buried in Stockholm. He bequeathed many of his works to his brother, Mildhog, who presented them to the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm and the G&ouml;teborgs Konstmuseum; the manuscripts of his books are in the Kungliga Biblioteket (royal library) in Stockholm. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Kungliga Akademien (Royal Academy of Sweden) from March to July of 1876.<br>
