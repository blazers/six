<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Markby, Sir  William</span>  (1829&#150;1914), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born on 31 May 1829 at Duxford St Peter rectory, Cambridgeshire, the fourth son of the rector, the Revd William Henry Markby (1786&#150;1866), and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Randall (1798&#150;1865). He was educated at King Edward's School, Bury St Edmunds, before matriculating at Merton College, Oxford, in 1846. A mathematics postmaster, he graduated with first-class honours in 1851, having played cricket and rowed for his college. Admitted to the Inner Temple on 9 November 1853, he read in the chambers of Edward Turner, and was called to the bar on 5 June 1856, being made an MA by Oxford and, by incorporation, Cambridge, in the same year.<br>
<br>Markby practised on the Norfolk circuit (1856&#150;66) and was recorder of Buckingham (1865&#150;6), before being appointed a judge of the high court of Bengal (1866&#150;78). On 22 March 1866 he married Lucy (1841&#150;1928), daughter of John Edward Taylor of Weybridge, and niece of the jurist John Austin's widow, Sarah, whom Markby helped prepare Austin's <span class="italic">Lectures on Jurisprudence</span> for publication (1863).<br>
<br>As a judge Markby was noted for his care and conscientiousness, which were constant features in a life conspicuous for the achievement of excellence and devotion to duty. Politically a Liberal, he was sympathetic to those around him aspiring for Indian self-government. He was vice-chancellor of Calcutta University (1877&#150;8). On retirement from the bench in 1878, he was knighted and returned to England.<br>
<br>Immediately Markby took up the newly created readership in Indian law at Oxford, a post he held until 1900. His duties involved the supervision of probationers selected for the Indian Civil Service studying at the university, as well as lecturing on the Anglo-Indian codes and teaching the elements of Hindu and Islamic law. Active in university committee work, he was a member of hebdomadal council, a curator of the university chest, and a delegate of the Clarendon Press. The university settlement in east London, Toynbee Hall, was one of the liberal causes which he promoted. A fellow of All Souls by virtue of his readership, he also served as its domestic bursar until Balliol recruited him as its bursar and made him an official fellow (1883&#150;1900). It was in Markby's rooms at All Souls that he, Thomas Erskine Holland, Frederick Pollock, James Bryce, and William Anson initiated the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, which became a legal journal of international renown. A county alderman and JP, noted for his business acumen, Markby was appointed KCIE (1889) and served as a commissioner to inquire into administration of justice in Trinidad and Tobago (1892) and as a railway commissioner (1906).<br>
<br>The fruit of Markby's teaching and legal career is to be found in his published works: the eleventh edition (with W. Mills) of H. Roscoe's <span class="italic">Digest of the Law of Evidence in the Trial of Actions at nisi prius</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Lectures on Indian Law</span> (1873), <span class="italic">The Indian Evidence Act</span> (1897), <span class="italic">An Introduction to Hindu and Mohammedan Law</span> (1906), and, most importantly, his <span class="italic">Elements of Law Considered with Reference to the Principles of General Jurisprudence</span> (six editions: 1871, 1874, 1885, 1889, 1896, and 1905). Whereas some of his other works were undertaken after deafness had begun to curtail his involvement in committee work, his <span class="italic">Elements</span> had been written while he was in India teaching Hindu students, and mirrored the interest in legal theory and general jurisprudence which his contact with other legal cultures had stimulated. The work, once much read, earned him the DCL from Oxford (1879), but belongs to a genre which later became virtually extinct. Undoubtedly, such studies were inspired by the contact with other legal orders afforded by the colonial experience and reached their apogee in the work of scholars such as Henry Maine. The book's importance lies in that it was among the first to present English law in terms of general jurisprudential categories, obtained as a result of comparative analysis. When it was written, there were no textbooks as such dealing with subjects such as tort or crime in English law. Its achievement can be measured by the fact that when such books came to be written, the analytical models they adopted were those pioneered in works such as Markby's <span class="italic">Elements</span>. Its influence was therefore great, but its fate was to be overtaken and replaced by those later works. Interest in this type of analytical approach waned with the decline of empire and increase in the influence of American theorists together with a return to philosophical rather than comparative and historical perspectives in jurisprudence.<br>
<br>Markby died at his home at Headington Hill, Oxford, on 15 October 1914, and was buried four days later at Headington cemetery. In 1917 his widow published a memoir of his life containing a portrait.<br>
