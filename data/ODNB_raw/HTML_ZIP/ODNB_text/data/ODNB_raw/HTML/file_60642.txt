<span class="headword">Nu, U</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">prime minister of Burma</span>, was born on 25 May 1907 in Wakema, Myaungmya, Burma, the elder son of U San Htun, merchant, and his wife, Daw Saw Khin. His parents were prosperous traders, selling monks' robes from a drapery store in the Wakema bazaar. According to Burmese tradition, Saturday-born first children were supposed to be quarrelsome, and to induce quarrelsomeness between their parents. Hence he was given the name Nu (Gentle) and was nominally sold to his aunt Daw Gyi and her husband, U Shwe Gon, well-to-do landowners who lived with his parents. Like all Burmese names Nu's was attended by several honorific titles. He was known as Maung Nu as a youth and young man and as U Nu thereafter. He was given a special title of Thakin Nu, as were all the members of the Dobama Asi-ayone (Our Burma Association). It was usual for the members of associations to take a personal title from their membership but Nu never took on this modest claim to fame, although he was known by others as Thakin Nu for most of his adult life.<br>
<br>Nu was educated first at the Wakema Anglo-Vernacular Government School, but he left in 1920 following the school strike called in response to the promotion to university status of Rangoon College. He then attended the new national school in Wakema and, from 1922, Myoma national high school, Rangoon. He had a wayward adolescence, frequently embarrassing his parents by his excessive drinking, and contracting venereal disease from one of many encounters with prostitutes. At the age of eighteen he resolved to follow a Buddhist way of life, and gave up alcohol as a token of his commitment. In the same year, 1925, he entered the University of Rangoon. Graduating in 1929, he became superintendent of a national school at Pantanaw, of which the headmaster was U Thant, later to be secretary-general of the United Nations. In 1931 he eloped with and married Ma Mya Yi, daughter of U Aung Nyein, a wealthy rice miller and president of the Pantanaw national school committee. Following his marriage (to which his parents-in-law became reconciled) Nu taught in Thongwa before returning in 1934 to Rangoon, where he worked for a Burmese-language newspaper and enrolled as a law student at the University of Rangoon.<br>
<br>In his second spell as a university student Nu was actively involved in the Rangoon University Students' Union, and became a close colleague of Aung San, editor of <span class="italic">Oway</span>, the students' paper. In 1936 Nu wrote an article in <span class="italic">Oway</span> which was highly critical of the university's British principal, D. J. Sloss, and for this he was expelled. For several weeks the university students went on strike. Nu was allowed to return, though he left the university without completing his course. The victory of Nu and the students' union marked a new impetus both in student affairs and in opposition to British rule. His subsequent activities in the Dobama Asi-ayone and as organizer of the Nagani (Red Dragon) book club, disseminating nationalist literature, led the government to imprison him in 1940, along with many of his closest colleagues. He was then released by the British authorities in a vain attempt to send him as an emissary to China's Kuomintang leaders.<br>
<br>This was the situation when the Japanese invaded Burma in December 1941. They set up a Burmese government with Ba Maw as leader. Nu initially remained outside the government, but in August 1943 he joined it as foreign minister, although, as he said himself, he was a &#145;Minister without a Ministry&#146;. He made several visits overseas as a minister and lieutenant for Ba Maw. All this came to an end when the British expelled the Japanese in mid-1945. Nu used his new-found freedom to write a serious study of the effects of Japanese rule in Burma. This first appeared in the Burmese language but J. S. Furnivall, a retired Burma civil servant, assisted Nu in producing an English-language version of his study which eventually appeared under the title <span class="italic">Burma under the Japanese: Pictures and Portraits</span> (1954). The book was frank about the relationship between the Burmese and their Japanese masters.<br>
<br>When the war ended, Nu retired into private life: however, his move away from politics did not last long. In 1946 he was elected vice-president of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), into which Aung San had brought most of the nationalist elements in Burma. In June 1947 Nu was elected to the nominally non-party role of speaker of the constituent assembly formed to draft a constitution, following the London agreement of January 1947 between Aung San and Clement Attlee. Although the returning British were in a strong position with their military forces, Aung San was able to rival their strength: the AFPFL had emerged as the strongest political movement in Burma, although Ba Maw tried to come forward with a rival organization, financed by the money he had amassed under the Japanese. On the fringe of both these leading organizations there were quasi-military elements only loosely controlled by the rival leaders. Certain of Ba Maw's lieutenants tried to enhance the power of their boss by building up his military power. This rivalry ended in July 1947 when Ba Maw's thugs burst into the secretariat (the political and administrative centre for Burma) and gunned down Aung San and his cabinet. Ba Maw hoped to cause chaos in Aung San's political machine. Fortunately for him, Nu was not present at the ill-fated cabinet meeting and in any case was too popular to be disposed of summarily. The governor, Sir Hubert Rance, was not prepared to see his new political reforms disposed of, and he sent for Nu to ask him to become prime minister. If Rance and Nu had not acted so quickly, there is no doubt that something like civil war would have consumed central Burma. As it was, their action pre-empted opposition.<br>
<br>Nu was able to take advantage of Aung San's charisma to push ahead with political reform. In September 1947 the new constitution was agreed, and in October, Nu signed the treaty of Burmese independence, in London, leading to independence on 4 January 1948 (a date set following Nu's consultations with astrologers). By then Nu had achieved useful administrative changes, although the army (Aung San's principal legacy) was out of control. For several months the rebellious soldiers were almost into the suburbs of Rangoon, but Nu, who had no experience of this kind of politics, was able to return most of the country to something like normal life. He followed Aung San's style by setting up five- and ten-year plans designed to bring about a more stable society. The first ten years of his administration were to be the most successful, and he was able to introduce some of his most cherished objectives.<br>
<br>The army leaders, notably the commander-in-chief General Ne Win, were jealous of Nu's success, and in September 1958 (following a split in the AFPFL and a deteriorating security situation) Nu was persuaded to relinquish power to a caretaker government led by Ne Win, which would restore stability and prepare the country for elections in 1960. However, the military junta followed much the same directions as Nu and his friends. They had promised to get away from the office and lead the country from the field: but this did not happen. Indeed, military rule brought in even more bureaucratic methods. By the time of the 1960 elections it was clear that military rule had little if anything to add to the regular methods of government&#151;that is, a bureaucracy with a veneer of parliamentary control&#151;and the people began to look back to the parliamentary period with nostalgia. Nu returned to power following the elections in February 1960, supported by some of his faithful allies and by a new face on the scene&#151;Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San. The army gave way to Nu with ill grace, and despite his renewed popularity he could not feel that he was altogether secure. In March 1962 he was again ousted by Ne Win and the army. Nu had attempted to change the government's policy towards the hill peoples: he endeavoured to bring their leaders back into government, thus challenging one of the main parts of the army's programme. He had also, shortly before the coup, announced a series of nationalization measures.<br>
<br>Following the March 1962 coup many of Nu's lieutenants were gaoled and in some cases executed. Nu himself was not treated so severely, though he was placed under house arrest. In 1967 he was permitted to leave Burma for health reasons. Until 1972 he lived in Thailand, from where he organized opposition to the military government in Burma; he then abandoned politics and went to live quietly in a Buddhist monastery in India. He returned from exile in 1980, at the invitation of Ne Win. He spent the following years translating Buddhist texts. Following the fall of Ne Win in 1988 he formed the Alliance for Peace and Democracy, and declared himself the legitimate prime minister. However, he failed to gain much popular support, and in September 1988 another military junta seized power. Nu was again placed under house arrest, until April 1992. After his release he campaigned on behalf of Aung San Suu Kyi, who he now realized was recognized as the leader of the pro-democracy movement in Burma.<br>
<br>Nu died in Rangoon on 14 February 1995. He was survived by three daughters and two sons, his wife having predeceased him. When U Thant had died, students at Rangoon University had demonstrated their fervent support for his work, causing the university to be closed once again. After Nu's death the army took precautions to avoid a similar demonstration and his funeral therefore was on a limited scale.<br>
