<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Postgate,  John Percival</span>  (1853&#150;1926), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Birmingham on 24 October 1853, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22595/', "John Postgate FRCS (1820&#150;1881)")</script>, of Scarborough, a campaigner against the adulteration of food, and his wife, Mary Ann (1815&#150;1898), daughter of Joshua Horwood of Driffield, a surgeon in the Royal Navy. Postgate was sent to King Edward VI School, Birmingham, where he became head boy, and in 1872 won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1876 he gained one of the chancellor's medals, and was placed eighth in the first class of the classical tripos, despite suffering from a severe toothache during his examinations. From 1876 to 1884 he coached private pupils for the classical tripos, the field having been left open by the death in 1876 of the leading classical coach, Richard Shilleto. Postgate was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1878, and in 1884 was appointed classical lecturer, an office which continued the fellowship; he was senior lecturer from 1903 to 1909. Since he held the lecturership for the requisite twenty-five years, he remained a fellow until his death.<br>
<br>Postgate made his scholarly reputation as an editor of Latin poetry. His first book was an edition of the best-known elegies of Propertius (<span class="italic">Select Elegies of Propertius</span>, 1881). Later he produced editions of Lucan (book 7, 1896; book 8, 1917) and a text and translation of Tibullus (<span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span>, 1913). His largest such project, however, was the <span class="italic">Corpus poetarum Latinorum</span>, which appeared first in fascicles and then as two quarto volumes (1893&#150;4; 1904&#150;5). This was a considerable achievement, the product of twenty years' work, which provided texts and critical commentary for the Latin poets, with the exception of the <span class="italic">Appendix Vergiliana</span>, the <i>poetae minores</i>, and such late poets as Ausonius and Claudian. Postgate was criticized for these omissions, as he was for his attempt to rearrange the couplets and poems of Propertius merely by internal evidence. In this, as in his liking for conjectural emendation, he was at once insightful and perverse.<br>
<br>The combination of scholarship and organizational power evident in the <span class="italic">Corpus</span> was also manifested in other spheres. Postgate acted as secretary of the Cambridge Philological Society for several years, and was editor of the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> from 1899 to 1907, and of the <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> from 1907 to 1911. By 1911 both journals had been taken over by the Classical Association of England and Wales, founded in 1903, which owed its existence largely to Postgate. In November 1902 he published in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> an article entitled &#145;Are the classics to go?&#146;, in which he pointed to the curricular debates following the passage of the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, and urged defenders of classics to rally before their subject was denied not only the &#145;lion's share&#146; of the school timetable, but any reasonable provision at all. The correspondence which ensued, notably with Edward Adolf Sonnenschein, led to the foundation of the Classical Association in December 1903. Postgate played a major part in forming its policy in its early years, and acted as joint secretary with Sonnenschein. He was elected president in 1924&#150;5.<br>
<br>Concurrently with his work in Cambridge, Postgate was from 1880 to 1910 professor of comparative philology at University College, London. The chair had been revived and renamed after the death of its previous incumbent, Thomas Hewitt Key, who had held the title of professor of comparative grammar. The post took little of Postgate's time, but his published output includes works in this area, from his <span class="italic">New Latin Primer</span> of 1888, to the introduction he provided for C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards's <span class="italic">Meaning of Meaning</span> (1923). His primer was written with C. A. Vince, a classmate at school and subsequently headmaster of Mill Hill School: it had the misfortune to appear in the same year as the <span class="italic">Revised Latin Primer</span> of Benjamin Hall Kennedy, which was adopted by the Headmasters' Conference and became the standard English textbook of Latin grammar. However, through the influence of the Cambridge scholar T. G. Tucker, who had become professor of classics at Melbourne, Postgate's book sold well in Australia. Postgate was a keen advocate of the &#145;reformed&#146; pronunciation of Latin, his great ally being W. H. D. Rouse, headmaster of the Perse School, Cambridge, and a leading advocate of direct method teaching; Postgate also supported this at first, but like others became sceptical of its value. Late in life he published two works on the accentuation of ancient Greek.<br>
<br>In 1909 Postgate accepted the chair of Latin in the University of Liverpool. He was then the obvious local candidate to succeed the aged J. E. B. Mayor as professor of Latin at Cambridge, but it may be that he had concluded the chair would go to A. E. Housman, who was elected after Mayor's death in 1910. At Liverpool, Postgate, who had seen Cambridge as a fortress of learning in an increasingly alien world of modernity, entered a <i>pays de mission</i>, and carried out his duties with energy. In his inaugural lecture, &#145;Dead language and dead languages&#146;, he mounted a spirited defence of his subject, enlivened by parallels between pure language and pure food which recall his father's medical campaigns.<br>
<br>While in Cambridge, Postgate had taught the women students at Girton College. His pupils were often seen leaving his composition classes in tears, but one who stood up to him was Edith Allen (1863&#150;1962), daughter of Thomas Bull Allen, tea merchant, and sister of the Oxford classical scholar T. W. Allen (1862&#150;1950). She and Postgate married in June 1891. Before their marriage Edith Allen was a classical mistress at South Hampstead high school. Of a determinedly independent character, she and their children (four sons and two daughters) developed a complicated private language to which Postgate himself seems not to have been privy. The children included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31564/', "Raymond Postgate")</script>, later well known as a journalist and as the author of the <span class="italic">Good Food Guide</span>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30953/', "Dame Margaret Cole")</script>, who married the socialist economic historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32486/', "G. D. H. Cole")</script>. In her memoirs, she remembered the atmosphere of early family life in Cambridge. Postgate's enthusiasm for learning Latin by the direct method (by speaking the language) was evidenced at mealtimes; at one Sunday dinner Margaret asked <i>da mihi bovem</i> (&#145;give me the ox&#146;) instead of <i>da mihi bovis</i> (&#145;give me some beef&#146;), and found the whole vast sirloin thrust at her. The incident also illustrates what was called Postgate's &#145;vehemence&#146;, a trait also evident in his performance in Trinity College cricket matches, where according to M. J. Rendall, &#145;if he tapped or pushed the ball a few yards, [he] started wildly as if shot from a cannon and inevitably ran his companion out&#146;.<br>
<br>On retiring from Liverpool, Postgate returned to Cambridge in 1920. By this time his achievements had been recognized by the award of honorary degrees from the universities of Manchester (1906) and Dublin (1907); he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1907. During the First World War, his relations with Raymond had been strained to breaking point by the latter's pacificism. Raymond and Margaret were cut out of their father's will, and when Raymond married, Postgate refused to acknowledge the marriage or to meet his daughter-in-law. Against this, it must be said that while Raymond was facing prosecution for his beliefs, his father worked hard to protect him, for example by asking Gilbert Murray to bring influence to bear in government circles. The last meeting of father and son was seen by the latter as the beginning of a reconciliation, but Postgate died before the process could be completed. In his final will, he decreed that Raymond and Margaret should receive &pound;100 a year each when they reached fifty-five.<br>
<br>On 14 July 1926 Postgate was knocked off his cycle by a lorry in Cambridge, and died of his injuries at the Addenbrooke's Hospital on the following day. His last recorded words, &#145;Take me to Addenbrooke's, I have a subscription there&#146;, illustrated his ingrained fear of poverty; he removed the light bulbs to save electricity when he visited his children's nursery. He was comfortably off when he died; a legacy of over &pound;27,000 to Trinity College was refused, and passed to the University of Liverpool.<br>
<br>Raymond Postgate remembered his father as &#145;a rather short, dominant man, with prominent blue eyes and a walrus moustache&#146;. Postgate was a typical Victorian father, a kind of rude natural force to be reckoned with. His friend and obituarist, the classical scholar S. G. Owen, while emphasizing his &#145;exceptional attractiveness&#146;, felt obliged to refer to his &#145;angular personality&#146;. In his scholarly campaigns he was energetic and determined, and though he did not seek controversy, he was a formidable opponent. On a small point, he pursued the editor of the <span class="italic">Thesaurus linguae Latinae</span> in the journals of several countries. As a teacher, he was at his best in small groups, while in lectures, his somewhat drawling delivery soon seemed monotonous.<br>
