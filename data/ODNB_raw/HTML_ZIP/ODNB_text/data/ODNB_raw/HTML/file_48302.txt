<span class="headword">Theodosius</span> <span class="st"> [Flavius Theodosius; <em>known as </em>Count Theodosius]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 376), <span class="occ">Roman general</span>, conventionally known as Count Theodosius from an extraordinary military command that he held in Britain in 367&#150;8, as <i>comes</i> (general, or &#145;count&#146;); he is also called Theodosius the elder to distinguish him from his second son, the emperor Theodosius (<i>r</i>. 379&#150;95). Since the younger Theodosius was born <i>c</i>.346 at Cauca (Coca) in Spain (where he owned land after his father's death) and since kinsmen are recorded in 408 as influential landowners in Spain, it is likely that Count Theodosius himself came from a Spanish propertied family. His wife's name was Thermantia. The family was evidently Christian but is unlikely to have been rich and well-connected before his time, since he (unusually for landed gentry in the late-Roman period) chose a military career and seems to have lacked higher education and the younger Theodosius, even according to a sympathetic source, was only &#145;moderately cultured&#146;  (Pichlmayr, 48.11&#150;12). Nothing is known of Theodosius's early career (which was &#145;distinguished&#146;, according to the contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus), unless it is implied by a panegyrist's allusion to &#145;land victories in Batavia [modern Netherlands] and defeat of the Saxons by sea&#146;  (Pacatus, 5.2) which might belong to the emperor Valentinian I's recovery of the Rhine frontier in 366, but are more likely to relate to the ill-defined campaigns of 367&#150;8.<br>
<br>In June 367 Valentinian had received news of a concerted attack upon Britain by its neighbours, the so-called &#145;Barbarian conspiracy&#146; of which Ammianus Marcellinus gives the only real account. Archaeological evidence in confirmation has often been sought, but continues to be elusive, while Ammianus Marcellinus's account is geographically vague and leaves questions unanswered; that he was writing in the reign of Theodosius's son probably forced him to panegyrize the father. The invaders were Picts from north of the Clyde&#150;Forth isthmus, Scots from Ireland, and &#145;Attacotti&#146; of unknown origin; meanwhile north-German Franks and Saxons were attacking &#145;the Gallic areas&#146; (the channel coast of Gaul or possibly of Britain) . The Roman coastal commander had been killed, and his colleague, the general (<i>dux</i>) who commanded the land garrison of Britain, had been eliminated. The obscure <i>areani</i> who collected military intelligence beyond the frontiers had changed sides, a &#145;province&#146; had been overrun, and many soldiers had deserted their units. To retrieve these disasters, Theodosius was sent to Britain with the rank of <i>comes</i> and a small army consisting of four infantry units from the strategic reserve.<br>
<br>Theodosius landed at Rutupiae (Richborough, Kent) and advanced towards London, the capital, rounding up enemy raiding parties as he went. At London, his base for the winter of 367&#150;8, he successfully offered an amnesty to Roman deserters and recruited a new head of the civil administration (the <i>vicarius</i>) and a new <i>dux</i> of the British garrison. Ammianus Marcellinus gives no details of the fighting that restored Roman authority in 368: his principal episode is the arrest and execution of a criminal exiled to Britain who was now plotting to seize power. This episode remains mysterious, perhaps because Theodosius forbade further investigation, but also because the victim Valentinus was brother-in-law of the Maximinus who later became Valentinian's praetorian prefect and chief civil minister. Theodosius is also said to have &#145;restored cities and forts, and protected the frontiers with garrisons and outposts&#146;  (Ammianus Marcellinus, 28.3.3, 28.3.7), perhaps appropriate to a refurbishment of the fixed defences like that which was being directed by Valentinian on the Rhine and Danube frontiers; but possible pieces of evidence&#151;such as fort repairs and the drafting of new garrisons, the strengthening of town walls with towers, the deployment of &#145;signal towers&#146; on the north Yorkshire coast&#151;have not been dated conclusively to 368. Theodosius is also said to have created a new province called Valentia; this certainly existed thereafter, but its location remains uncertain. The mysterious <i>areani</i>, who probably operated north of Hadrian's Wall, were disbanded.<br>
<br>Theodosius's achievement was genuine&#151;his subsequent career proves that&#151;but it cannot be quantified. On his return to the imperial court he was promoted to joint commander-in-chief (<i>magister equitum</i>) and operated successfully against the German Alamanni in the Black Forest in 370, and again in 372, when he commanded the cavalry advance guard in Valentinian's penetration of the Main valley. He may also have campaigned on the Danube. Then in 373 he achieved another independent command, this time in Mauretania (modern Algeria), where Roman rule was threatened by a major internal revolt. Its leader was a Moorish chieftain called Firmus who had killed his pro-Roman brother Sammac in a dispute over the succession to their father &#145;King&#146; Nubel, thereby upsetting the equilibrium in Mauretania between the Romanized cities and farmers, protected by static garrisons and a small mobile reserve, and the necessary loyalty of the native tribal chieftains. Theodosius sailed from Arles with a small army, with which he arrested incompetent local officials and punished disloyal units with savage reprisals; then in a brilliant series of campaigns (373&#150;4), which combined long marches and pitched battles against heavy numerical odds, and by judicious diplomacy and terrorism, he broke up Firmus's coalition of tribes and procured his betrayal. Firmus, who had once denounced Theodosius to his own (Theodosius's) men as a &#145;brutal executioner&#146;, killed himself rather than fall into his hands alive.<br>
<br>Theodosius was now congratulated as the &#145;physician of Africa's recovery&#146; by the orator Symmachus, who exclaimed that his fame would never yield to &#145;envy&#146;. This qualification may have been added to the letter  (Symmachus, x.1) when it was published, for Theodosius fell from power when his patron Valentinian suddenly died of a stroke, on 17 November 375, in distant Pannonia (modern Hungary). Theodosius, who was then still in Africa, was arrested and taken to Carthage where, after receiving baptism, he was beheaded in December 376. Contemporaries understandably tell us almost nothing about the execution for &#145;treason&#146; of an emperor's father. Ammianus Marcellinus is entirely silent. However, it seems unlikely that Theodosius was actually planning a coup. The order for his execution must have come from the imperial court where his colleague Merobaudes, joint commander-in-chief (<i>magister peditum</i>), was taking other precautions against a possible usurpation. But even if the execution was a matter of business for Merobaudes, he gained personally by removing a rival.<br>
<br>The younger Theodosius, who was then a <i>dux</i> on the Danube frontier, retired to Spain; but after the death of Valentinian's younger brother, the eastern emperor Valens, in battle against the Goths on 9 August 378, Valentinian's son Gratian recalled Theodosius to take command. Soon afterwards, on 19 January 379, Theodosius was promoted to the vacant eastern throne, where he founded a dynasty which lasted another two generations in both the east (until 450) and the west (until 455). Count Theodosius, therefore, as the new dynasty's &#145;divine&#146; ancestor, was duly honoured posthumously in panegyric and by the erection of public statues.<br>
