<span class="headword">Seaman,  William</span>  (1606/7&#150;1680), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was probably born at Upton Scudamore, near Warminster in Wiltshire, the son of William Seaman, &#145;gentleman&#146; (<i>d</i>. 1660), who rented the manor farm, known as Acres Farm, in the same year, and bought the lease in 1636. Seaman matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 7 February 1624, aged seventeen, graduating BA at the same time, and proceeded MA on 6 July 1626. In 1628 he was appointed rector of Upton Scudamore, a living which afforded him about &pound;100 a year. Shortly after his institution he went to Constantinople in the service of Sir Peter Wyche, English ambassador from 1628 to 1639. He there learned Turkish and possibly also Arabic. There is no information about the date or the length of his stay, but it cannot have been very long since he was officiating at Upton Scudamore in 1628 and, it would seem from the bishops' transcripts, from 1631 onwards. On 24 October 1634 he married Mary Hollimar (<i>d</i>. 1671) from Ashton Gifford in Codford St Peter. The couple had at least one son.<br>
<br>Seaman gradually obtained a reputation as a Turkish expert&#151;his position in the republic of letters was confirmed by his correspondence with the French scholar Louis Picques&#151;while he proved his capabilities as an Arabist with his translation of the index of a codex on Islam, entitled in English the &#145;Splendour of the exhorter&#146;, in the archbishop of Canterbury's library at St Martin's (BL, Add. MS 24858). His first publication in the domain of Turkish studies was his translation into English of a historical work, the initial part of Sadettin Hoca's <span class="italic">Tac &uuml;t-tevarih</span> (&#145;The crown of histories&#146;) published as <span class="italic">The Reign of Sultan Orchan, Second King of the Turks</span> (1652). Here, as in his other works, he stressed the utility of Turkish for historians. The translation was dedicated to Jane, Lady Merick, formerly the widow of Sir Peter Wyche, to whose family he remained devoted after Sir Peter's death in 1643.<br>
<br>In December 1655 Seaman was appointed secretary of the trade committee (which met at Westminster) at a yearly salary of &pound;100. Some years later he became involved in an international project of evangelization of the Levant, originating in the circle of Samuel Hartlib, whose millenarian convictions included belief in the imminent conversion to Christianity of the Muslims and a determination to hasten the process. In England the plan was fostered by Hartlib himself, Henry Oldenburg, John Durie, and above all Robert Boyle, with Edward Pococke and John Worthington taking a marginal role. It obtained even more support in the Netherlands, thanks mainly to the Bohemian scholar Jan Amos Comenius and the French refugee Petrus Serrarius. A fundamental role was to be played by the translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Turkish. The Dutch, who relied on a Polish convert to Islam in Constantinople, were slow, however, and only the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was completed. Boyle then turned to Seaman, who had already translated the Johannine epistles into Turkish in 1659, asking him to translate the entire <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. By 1664 Seaman had done so and two years later his translation was published at Boyle's expense in Oxford, making Seaman the first European to publish a Turkish translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. In the meantime, also at the instigation of Boyle, Seaman had translated into Turkish John Ball's <span class="italic">Short Catechisme</span>. It was published in 1660, the first Turkish work to be issued at Oxford. Copies were distributed by Robert Huntington, chaplain to the Levant Company in Aleppo.<br>
<br>In 1670 Seaman published his <span class="italic">Grammatica linguae Turcicae</span>. Boyle undertook to buy &pound;20 worth of copies, and Sir Cyril Wyche (Sir Peter's youngest son) also contributed. Seaman had hoped to publish a Turkish&#150;Latin lexicon on which he had been working for some years (and on which he continued to work until the year of his death), but the dictionary remained in manuscript (Bodl. Oxf. MS Rawl. Or. 58). He did, however, assist Edmund Castell in assimilating the contents of Ni'matull&acirc;h's Persian&#150;Turkish dictionary in the <span class="italic">Lexicon heptaglotton</span> published in 1669. In his study of Turkish, Seaman was a pioneer in England. He was the first Englishman to produce a grammar, but not the first European. In contrast to Seaman's, however, few other Turkish grammars were printed in Ottoman characters.<br>
<br>The quality of Seaman's work was widely criticized, at the time and later. Jacobus Golius, professor of Arabic at Leiden and with a sound knowledge of Turkish, reported the devastating judgement of Seaman's <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by the Armenian Shahin Kandy. There was little point in circulating the translation in the Ottoman empire, he said, since it would probably be considered incomprehensible, so &#145;artificial&#146; were &#145;the nature and the use of the language&#146;  (Kleerkoper and Stockum, 1243). The grammar hardly fared better. It lacks any form of systematic approach to Turkish, contains numerous errors, and includes a thoroughly unreliable guide to the pronunciation of the language. Less than forty years later Thomas Vaughan could truthfully say of his own Turkish grammar that, although it could not compete with the lexicographical work of the imperial interpreter Meninski (which was published in 1680 and remained unsurpassed until the nineteenth century), at least it was &#145;an Improvement of Mr Seaman's&#146;. But he nevertheless acknowledged his debt to a predecessor to whom his grammar owed &#145;its Form, and well-nigh all the Substance too&#146;  (Vaughan, xvi). Seaman had also had trouble with his Latin, and had applied to Samuel Clarke, the architypographus of the Oxford University Press, and to Clarke's master, Edward Pococke, to improve his style and correct his preface.<br>
<br>Seaman, whom Edward Pococke's biographer Leonard Twells described as a moderate nonconformist and &#145;a sober, discreet, and modest man&#146;  (Twells, 276), was profoundly committed to the conversion of the Muslims and the propagation of protestantism in the Levant. He spent much of his time in London, where he owned a house in Whitecross Alley, Moorfields, and consorted with the &#145;Turkie merchants&#146; and members of the Levant Company who provided numerous subscribers to his Turkish <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and saw to the distribution of his translations in the Ottoman empire. Yet he appears to have been a conscientious rector of his living. He died at his London house on 7 November 1680, and was buried two days later at Upton Scudamore at his church of St Mary the Virgin.<br>
