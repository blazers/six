<span class="headword">Monro,  James</span>  (1838&#150;1920), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 25 November 1838, the son of George Munro, solicitor before the supreme courts, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson. After education at Edinburgh high school, Edinburgh University, and Berlin University, he was successful in the examination for the Indian Civil Service in 1857, as one of the earliest &#145;competition wallahs&#146;. Posted to Bengal, he arrived in India in January 1858, and served as a magistrate and collector in Calcutta from 1864 to 1874, when he became a district judge. In 1863 he married Ruth (1843&#150;1931), daughter of William Littlejohn, banker, of Aberdeen; they had at least two sons and a daughter. In 1878 the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, Sir Ashley Eden, appointed him inspector-general of police in Bengal, where he commanded a force of 20,000 men. He displayed a capacity for detective work, and became &#145;a veritable terror to the criminal classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Jan 1920). In 1882 he reported on village police forces in Bengal, and in 1883 became commissioner of the presidency division of Bengal.<br>
<br>While on leave in Britain, Monro was appointed in June 1884 to take charge of the criminal investigation department (CID) of the Metropolitan Police, made vacant by the resignation of Howard Vincent. Unlike his predecessor, Monro was given the rank of assistant commissioner, placing him directly under the authority of the Metropolitan Police commissioner, initially Edmund Henderson. Monro's experience of tackling secret societies in Bengal was a recommendation in the eyes of the home secretary, W. V. Harcourt, as London was then the target of the Fenian dynamiting campaign. His swift action ensured the arrest of the perpetrator of the Fenian explosion at the Tower of London in January 1885, but he complained that his investigations were hindered by the activities of the Dublin Castle &#145;spymaster&#146;, Edward Jenkinson, who ran an independent counter-Fenian operation using Irish officers in London. Monro alleged that Jenkinson withheld intelligence, and that some of the plotters were found to be in Jenkinson's pay; Jenkinson regarded the Metropolitan Police men as inefficient, and Monro as insufficiently energetic to impose reforms.<br>
<br>Monro's complaints led to Jenkinson's dismissal by the Conservative home secretary, Henry Matthews, at the end of 1886, leaving Monro to take charge of the newly constituted Metropolitan Police special branch from the beginning of 1887, alongside his CID duties. He oversaw operations against the so-called Jubilee Plot against Queen Victoria in June 1887, and in the following year his detectives deterred Irish-Americans plotting in Paris to assassinate the Irish secretary, A. J. Balfour, by keeping them under open observation. In April 1888 he gave evidence to a parliamentary select committee that Fenian dynamiters had gained access to the House of Commons as guests of an Irish Nationalist MP, allegations damaging to Parnell's home rule party. He was appointed CB in June 1888.<br>
<br>Monro's relations with Sir Charles Warren, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1886, deteriorated, as Warren regarded detective work as subordinate to that of the uniformed police constables. By 1887 Monro was complaining that his detective force was under strength, and inadequate to the task of supervising ex-convicts, those on licence, and habitual criminals. After a series of complaints that Warren was stifling the CID, and had thwarted his intended appointment of an Indian planter friend Melville Macnaghten as assistant commissioner, Monro resigned in mid-August 1888, but was given a position in the Home Office, as head of detectives, with responsibility for special branch operations.<br>
<br>Warren resented Monro's continuing influence over the CID as undermining his position as commissioner, and resigned in November 1888. Monro was appointed his successor, with effect from December 1888, &#145;the first trained police official&#146;  (Dilnot, 108) to hold that office. He took over after the last of the Jack the Ripper Whitechapel murders, but it was left to him, in his annual report for 1888, to &#145;regret that in spite of most strenuous efforts on the part of the police, the criminal has up till now remained undiscovered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of the Commissioner</span>, 4). He increased the number of detectives and secured Macnaghten's appointment. Speedy arrests of a gang of burglars who had shot a Muswell Hill householder during a break-in, in January 1889, and the passing of life sentences in their trial, in March, were accounted successes. A purge on gaming clubs in London's fashionable West End, carried out in April 1889 by his friend and fellow evangelical Christian Robert Anderson, now head of the CID, was a prelude to a campaign against gambling, seen as a source of poverty and crime lower down the social spectrum. He dealt with demonstrations of the unemployed and socialists with a lighter hand than Warren, and during the London dock strike, which began in August 1889 and where pickets were extensively deployed, &#145;the police kept themselves in the background as far as possible, and their conduct when action was necessary was friendly and forbearing in the extreme&#146;  (Clegg, Fox, and Thompson, 63). In 1890 a new headquarters for the force was nearing completion on the Thames Embankment, which he named New Scotland Yard.<br>
<br>Monro's determination to address the concerns of his men at a time of growing agitation within the ranks on such matters as the quality of boots and uniform trousers, and the scale of allowances for the extra duty entailed in policing demonstrations in central London, brought him into conflict with the Home Office. The Metropolitan Police's officers had long considered that their pension rights needed improvement, yet a bill introduced in 1882 to deal with the issue failed to pass. Monro took his men's part on the Home Office departmental committee appointed in 1889 to investigate the subject. Monro announced his resignation as commissioner on 12 June 1890, when he decided that the pensions bill proposed by Henry Matthews would not go far enough. There was also a clash over patronage when Matthews attempted to install a Home Office civil servant with no police experience into a vacant assistant commissionership, which Monro wanted for a serving officer, Charles Howard, formerly of the Bengal police.<br>
<br>Monro's resignation, after just seventeen months as commissioner, led to a House of Commons debate (20 June 1890), initiated by Harcourt. Before leaving office Monro presided over meetings of his superintendents, to discuss the pensions question. In the event the <span class="roman">Police Act</span> of 1890 did meet the demand for a pension to be awarded as a right, and Monro claimed credit for forcing Matthews to improve the superannuation terms. Matthews also gave way over Howard's appointment. Monro recounted the history of the police pensions controversy in an article in the <span class="italic">New Review</span> (3, Sept 1890, 194&#150;207). He also wrote an account of the ethos of the &#145;London Police&#146;, asserting that its effectiveness was increased by the public's acceptance of policemen &#145;as their friends and protectors&#146; whether in helping the &#145;timid&#146; to cross busy thoroughfares or taking care of lost children, while &#145;protecting &#147;masses&#148; as well as &#147;classes&#148; from any infringement of their rights on the part of those who are not law-abiding&#146;  (<span class="italic">North American Review</span>, 151, Nov 1890, 617&#150;18).<br>
<br>Popular within the force, Monro was not viewed so favourably by some politicians and the Home Office, the prime minister Lord Salisbury telling the queen that Monro &#145;posed not as your Majesty's servant&#146;, but &#145;as if he had been captain of a band of allied troops taken into your service&#146;  (Cook, 78). The later discovery of Monro's unpublished reminiscences brought to light an earlier personal history of &#145;professional quarrels and threats of resignation&#146;, and &#145;an implacable impulse to self-justification&#146;  (Fido and Skinner, 168).<br>
<br>Monro had been a member of the Church Missionary Society's committee in India and after his resignation from the Metropolitan Police he left his London home, in Church Road, Norwood, and set out for Calcutta in November 1891, where he and his family began independent missionary work. He founded and himself financed the Ranaghat Medical Mission at a railway junction north of Calcutta, providing medical assistance on condition of attendance at religious services. With a Scottish staff of four men and eleven women, he made converts among the Hindu and Muslim population. Though a member of the Church of Scotland, he co-operated with the Church of England diocese. In December 1893 he gave evidence in Calcutta to the opium commission, insisting that the cultivation and consumption of opium did not hinder missionary work or increase crime, and opposing regulation of the trade as leading to greater problems. He returned to Britain in 1905, and lived for a while in Cheltenham. He died at his home, 15 Bolton Road, Chiswick, Middlesex, on 28 January 1920.<br>
