</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bagot,  Lewis</span>  (1740&#150;1802), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol, Norwich, and St Asaph</span>, was born on 1 January 1740, the fifth son of Sir Walter Bagot, fifth baronet (1702&#150;1768), of Blithfield, Staffordshire, and his wife, Lady Barbara Legge (<i>d</i>. 1765). He was a younger brother of William, first Baron Bagot. Educated at Westminster School, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 8 March 1757. His verses on the death of George II and accession of George III were printed in the <span class="italic">Oxford Poems</span> in 1761. He graduated BA in 1760, but his education was interrupted by ill health, which obliged him to live in Lisbon until 1764, when he proceeded MA on 23 May. Bagot was subsequently appointed a canon of Christ Church in 1771 and in the same year married Mary Hay (<i>d</i>. 1799), daughter of the Hon. Edward Hay, niece of the earl of Kinnoul, and sister of his predecessor in the canonry of Christ Church. There were no children from the marriage. In 1772 he was made DCL and was also presented by Lord Northampton to the livings of Jevington and Rye in Sussex.<br>
<br>Bagot quickly gained a reputation as a high-churchman and a defender of the religious character of university education. In 1772 he wrote a tract claiming that a university education was inherently a process of religious instruction, and the following year he opposed any change to the subscription by Oxford graduates to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. In 1777 Lewis Bagot was installed as dean of Christ Church. He continued his defence of the Anglican monopoly at Oxford by protesting that those who sought relief from the subscription would not give any guarantee that they only sought it for protestants. In this he was an ally of Sir Roger Newdigate.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1782 Bagot was consecrated bishop of Bristol, which he held together with the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. He remained at Bristol for only fifteen months before translation to Norwich in May 1783. In 1790 he was translated to St Asaph, where he rebuilt the bishop's palace and declared his intention of spending most of his time in the diocese. His visitation queries asked detailed questions about the residence of clergy and the position of curates in the diocese. His later years were marked by ill health, and he was wasted almost to a skeleton when he died at London on 4 June 1802. He was buried at St Asaph Cathedral, which he regarded as his home.<br>
<br>Bagot's high-church views led him into disputes with dissenters, and in 1776 he published a tract entitled <span class="italic">The Dangerous Errors of the Anabaptists</span>. He was a staunch and intolerant anti-Unitarian, and the strength of his views brought him much vilification. His Warburton lecture on the &#145;prophecies&#146; was published in 1780. His <span class="italic">Letter to the Revd William Bell</span>, published in 1781, advanced a high view of the eucharist akin to the views of bishops Atterbury and Horne. In the same year he gave fifty copies of Isaac Barrow's <span class="italic">Doctrine of the Sacraments</span>, which he had reprinted, to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. An important ingredient in Bagot's thought was a strongly providential view of society, which rejected ideas that progress from savagery to civilization had been the work of human agency alone. But Bagot's social ideology offered no special place for the poor, though he advocated the expansion of church schools, and argued that people should willingly pay their rates to support the poor.<br>
<br>At the root of Bagot's ideas lay a strong conservatism; his 1784 visitation charge&#151;described by Parson Woodforde as a very long but a very good charge&#151;proposed church reform and censured neglect of duty in order to prevent greater social change. Bagot earned for himself a strong reputation as a bishop of &#145;thorough goodness&#146;  (Abbey). The poet William Cowper, who had been at Westminster School with Bagot, excoriated the English bench of bishops but concluded:<blockquote>
<div>&hellip; Still [Providence] keeps a seat for worth and grace<br>
</div>
<div>And therefore 'tis that though the sight be rare<br>
</div>
<div>We sometimes see a Lowth or Bagot there.<br>
</div> (Cowper, 282)</blockquote>
