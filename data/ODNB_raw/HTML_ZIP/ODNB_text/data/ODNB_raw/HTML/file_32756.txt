<span class="headword">Day, Sir  John Charles Frederic Sigismund</span>  (1826&#150;1908), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at The Hague on 20 June 1826, the eldest son of Captain John Day (1779&#150;1843), a half-pay officer, of Englishbatch, near Bath, and his Dutch wife, Emilie (1789/90&#150;1836), daughter of Jan Caspar Hartsinck. His Roman Catholic parents sent him to school first at St Mary's College, Oscott, then in 1841 to Downside Priory, where he gained his BA from London University in 1845. He also spent time at Freiburg and learned four foreign languages. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 29 October 1845, he was called on 26 January 1849 but, having independent means, did not immediately commence a career at the bar. However, having suffered financial losses and with a growing family to support from his marriage on 1 October 1846 to Henrietta Rosa Mary Brown (1824&#150;1893), a banker's daughter, he began to practise, going the home circuit.<br>
<br>Day's fee earnings grew steadily, from &pound;200 in 1855 to &pound;2000 in 1866, and he increased his income and reputation by his writings. He co-authored an edition of Roscoe's <span class="italic">Nisi prius</span> and in 1861 brought out an annotated edition of the <span class="roman">Common Law Procedure Act</span> of 1852, which became the standard work on a statute of great importance to practitioners. He exploited his lugubrious and highly expressive countenance to great effect with juries and was a masterly cross-examiner whose favoured tactic was to rely wholly on destroying the other side's case and not to call his own evidence at all. Known as Settling Day for his tendency to compromise suits, he did not take silk until 1872 but immediately came to the forefront as the fashionable counsel for breach of promise actions and election petitions; he also became standing counsel to the London Omnibus Company. Pupils, including the future lord chancellor Robert Finlay, testified to his excellence as a pupil master. A bencher of his inn from 1873, he was treasurer in 1896. However, though he had a big and varied practice, he was less effective <i>in banco</i> (full court sittings) than at <i>nisi prius</i> (where a single judge presided), and seldom appeared before the House of Lords or privy council. Day continued to go on circuit, where his dry wit made him highly popular. He deplored the decay of circuit life and traditions in the railway age and set his own example in upholding them by frequently travelling on horseback between the circuit towns.<br>
<br>Having earlier turned down an offer to go as chief justice to Queensland, Day was made a judge of the Queen's Bench Division on 3 June 1882 and was knighted on 29 June. He was not a great success, for though by no means deficient in learning, he had no deep interest in the law and was indifferent to his reputation among lawyers and public. In civil cases, although speedy and usually correct, he annoyed litigants by often seeming uninterested and occasionally slumbering; in revenue cases in particular his attitude bordered on open contempt for the whole proceedings.<br>
<br>Day had evidently &#145;decided he would do most good by devoting his main energies to enforcing the moral law&#146;  (Day, 117) and now became Judgment Day, the readiness with which he resorted to the severest punishments earning him a fearsome reputation. He took great pains over his sentencing. One of the first judges routinely to provide himself with a full record of the criminal's previous convictions, he acquired first-hand knowledge of conditions in Liverpool by walking the worst streets at night with only his marshal and a single detective. He was a great believer in the efficacy of the lash&#151;he was said to have ordered 3766 lashes on 137 criminals&#151;and his especially fierce retribution for offences of violence made him popular in the northern cities; Liverpool was particularly grateful for his stern handling of the High Rip and Logwood gangs in 1887. However, his severity shocked many lawyers and occasionally outraged public sensibilities, as when he gave penal servitude for life to a seventeen-year-old. It was said that he, Phillimore, and Wills &#145;judged men by their own high standard of righteousness&#146;  (Rowlands, 100) and it was felt that &#145;where sexual immorality was concerned he knew no compassion, and seemed lost to all sense of proportion&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). It was known at the bar, however, that some of his heaviest sentences were pronounced for their deterrent effect and were reduced in private immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>Although he eschewed politics, Day became involved in political controversies because, as one of very few Roman Catholics on the English bench, he was a natural choice for inquiries into Irish affairs. In 1886 he chaired a commission on the recurrent Belfast riots, and though his refusal to allow cross-examination of witnesses brought him into sharp conflict with the leaders of the Irish bar, the general tenor of his report was sufficiently favourable to the Roman Catholics for Lord Salisbury's administration to assume that he would be acceptable to them to investigate (alongside Hannen and A. L. Smith) the charges levelled against Parnell and other Irish nationalist leaders in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Parnellism and Crime</span>. But the other parties had not been consulted and Day's appointment was bitterly assailed by the nationalists, who cited disparaging remarks about the Irish he had apparently uttered years before on assize. John Morley for the Liberals joined in, quoting a private letter from Judge Adams, one of the Belfast commissioners, which described Day as &#145;a man of the 17th century in his views, a catholic as strong as Torquemada, a tory of the old high-flier and non-juror type&#146;. Ministers vigorously defended their choice. Throughout the protracted proceedings of the commission Day maintained an almost unbroken silence and an air of profound boredom. He was credited with insisting on early proof of the authenticity of the damning letters attributed to Parnell, the exposure of which as forgeries provided the great sensation of the hearings, but he offered Hannen only half a page of notes towards the report.<br>
<br>Though Day's deadpan witticisms from the bench were relished by lawyers, his eccentric aversion to counsel's moustaches (he continued to affect the full side whiskers fashionable in his early manhood) and increasing deafness were not. He eventually resigned on 2 November 1901 and though sworn of the privy council he never sat on the judicial committee. His first wife had died on 26 March 1893 and on 19 May 1900 he married Edith, daughter of Edmund Westby, who survived him until at least 1921. He retired to Falkland Lodge, near Newbury, where he died on 13 June 1908. He was buried in the Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery. Two of his six sons became Jesuit priests and two others entered the law, one of whom became a master of the Supreme Court. His fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53544/', "Joseph Mary Day")</script>, was a mechanical engineer. One of his three daughters became a nun.<br>
<br>Though his Catholicism was devout and uncompromisingly traditional, Day consorted comfortably with men whose religion and politics differed widely from his. His closest friend was William Willis, a Baptist and radical who as a county court judge was as renowned for his leniency to debtors as Day was for his severity to offenders. Willis was his most frequent companion on the holidays where Day indulged his liking for long walks at a great pace. He was also a fine swimmer and enjoyed yachting.<br>
<br>From an early age Day collected art and displayed a discriminating, if rather narrow, taste. He was among the first to recognize the merits of the Barbizon school and, braving his wife's disapproval, which sometimes led him to smuggle his purchases into the house, he amassed an impressive collection which included a dozen works by Corot and three by Millet. It realized more than &pound;100,000 when it was sold after his death.<br>
