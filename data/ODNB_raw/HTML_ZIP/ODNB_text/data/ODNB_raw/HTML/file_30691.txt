<span class="headword">Bell,  James</span>  (1825&#150;1908), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Altnanaghan, Newtownhamilton, co. Armagh, in November 1825. He was educated privately and at University College, London, where he studied mathematics and chemistry, the latter under A. W. Williamson. In 1846 he became an assistant in the Inland Revenue laboratory at Somerset House, which had been established to carry out the provisions of the <span class="roman">Tobacco Act</span> of 1842, and was successively deputy principal (1867&#150;74) and principal until his retirement in 1894.<br>
<br>The work of the laboratory was not restricted to the examination of tobacco, but extended to the quality of brewing materials, the denaturing of alcohol for use in manufacture, and other matters affecting the excise. When the <span class="roman">Food and Drugs Act</span> of 1872 was amended in 1875, Bell was made chemical referee for all cases of disputed food analyses that appeared before the magistrates. In this capacity he developed methods for the chemical analysis of foods regulated by the act, and published his results in a successful book, <span class="italic">The Analysis and Adulteration of Foods</span> (2 vols., 1881, 1883). In 1882 he was awarded a PhD from the University of Erlangen in Germany in recognition of this work.<br>
<br>In connection with his official position, Bell was the chemical inspector for the lime and lemon juice supplied to the British merchant navy to prevent scurvy in seamen (1868&#150;94), and he was also consulting chemist to the Indian government, 1869&#150;94. His researches into the grape and malt ferments were published in his revised edition of the <span class="italic">Excise Officers' Manual</span> (1865) and in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> (1870). His research on tobacco was summarized in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Chemistry of Tobacco</span> (1887).<br>
<br>Bell's scientific contributions were recognized in 1884 by his election as FRS, and by the award of an honorary degree of DSc from the Royal University of Ireland (1886). He was made CB in 1889. He was a member of the Playfair committee on British and foreign spirits, and served as president of the Institute of Chemistry 1888&#150;91.<br>
<br>In 1858 Bell married Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of W. Reece of Chester. They had one son, Sir William James Bell, alderman of the London county council (1903&#150;7). Bell was generally well liked. The bad relations that existed between the Inland Revenue laboratory and the public analysts after the 1875 act did not extend to him, and had largely disappeared at the time of his death, which occurred at his home, 52 Cromwell Road, Hove, on 31 March 1908. He was buried on 4 April at Ewell, Surrey, where he had formerly resided.<br>
