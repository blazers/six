<span class="headword">Melmoth,  William, the younger</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1710, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">author and translator</span>, was probably born in London, one of the seven children and elder of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18535/', "William Melmoth the elder (1665/6&#150;1743)")</script>, barrister, and his second wife, Catherine, daughter of Samuel Rolt of Milton Erneys in Bedfordshire and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Dr Thomas Coxe. He was educated first at a private school in Westminster, under the tutelage of a Mr Philips, before being admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 June 1724, and admitted pensioner at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 24 June 1726, aged seventeen. Early sources suggest that he was also attached to Emmanuel College, but he seems not to have stayed long in Cambridge since he was called to the bar on 9 June 1732. In 1756 Sir John Eardley-Wilmot appointed Melmoth a commissioner of bankrupts.<br>
<br>According to earlier biographical sources, by 1739 Melmoth had left London and settled near Shrewsbury, but it is clear from surviving letters to his friend and publisher Robert Dodsley that he was based in Ealing until 1762. He seems to have abandoned the law at an early stage. Melmoth's first wife, Dorothy, daughter of William King (1685&#150;1763), died on 20 June 1761, and in the autumn of 1762 he settled in Bath with his second wife, a Miss M. Ogle. He had no children of his own, but adopted and educated Sophia Skynner, daughter and coheir of the Revd John Skynner and granddaughter of Melmoth's uncle, and later the mother of a son named Melmoth Walters.<br>
<br>Melmoth's earliest publication, &#145;Of an Active and Retired Life&#146;, a poetic epistle to Henry Coventry (<i>d</i>. 1752), first printed in 1735, was later included in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection</span>. He is supposed the author of imitations of two epistles of Horace (i.18 and ii.1) published by T. Cooper in 1736. The first volume of his <span class="italic">Letters on Several Subjects</span> appeared in 1748, under the pseudonym Sir Thomas Fitzosborne; a second volume was added in 1749. The letters are fictionalized but have generally been held to have some autobiographical reference, and they certainly illustrate Melmoth's own favourite themes of retirement, friendship, and rhetorical style. &#145;Fitzosborne's letters&#146; were to become one of Dodsley's best-sellers, going through ten editions by 1795; the eleventh edition, published in 1805, included an anonymous prefatory memoir which is usually attached to later printings of the work.<br>
<br>Melmoth actively contributed to various literary projects such as Edward Moore's <span class="italic">World</span> (1753&#150;6) and Dodsley's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1761), but otherwise occupied himself chiefly as a translator from Latin. The letters of Pliny the younger appeared in 1746, with a second edition in 1747 and a third in 1748. In 1753 Dodsley paid Melmoth &pound;600 for his translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">Ad familiares</span> (as compared with &pound;50 for Pliny's letters). Further translations from Cicero (<span class="italic">Cato, or, An Essay on Old Age</span> and <span class="italic">Laelius, or, An Essay on Friendship</span>) appeared in 1773 and 1777. All these translations are accompanied with Melmoth's own extensive and learned &#145;remarks&#146;.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Travels in Switzerland</span> of William Coxe consists of letters addressed to Melmoth, between 1776 and 1779, and in the edition of 1801 Coxe pays warm tribute to him as &#145;an affectionate and kindly instructor&#146;  (&#145;Advertisement&#146;, viii). In 1793 Melmoth published a pamphlet vindicating himself against an attack by Jacob Bryant two years earlier on the view expressed in his notes on Pliny on Trajan's attitude towards the Christians. His last work, the brief <span class="italic">Memoir of a Late Eminent Advocate</span>, published in 1796, had been intended some five years earlier to accompany an edition he was planning of his father's chancery reports. His reputation quickly faded after his death, and in an acerbic note in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (vol. 10, July 1824, 28) De Quincey describes his reluctance to take up the opportunity even to inspect a trunk full of Melmoth manuscripts. On the other hand Melmoth's version of Pliny's letters survived as the basis of the Loeb translation until 1969.<br>
<br>Although something of a recluse, Melmoth did have some dealings with Bath literary society. Mrs Thrale met him at Mrs Montagu's in 1780, reporting him to Johnson as &#145;just Tory enough to hate the Bishop of Peterborough for Whiggism, and Whig enough to abhor you for Toryism&#146; and eliciting from Johnson the response: &#145;From the author of Fitzosborne's letters I cannot think myself much in danger. I met him only once about thirty years ago, and in some small dispute reduced him to whistle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>). Despite his longevity his health seems generally to have been poor, and a posthumous difficulty over the disposal of his father's manuscripts suggests that by the 1790s he had become somewhat erratic in his dealings with others. Melmoth was of middle height, spare, with bright, quick eyes and a deeply lined face. He died at his home, 12 Bladud's Buildings, Bath, on 13 May 1799, and was survived by his second wife. There is a Latin epitaph on a tablet in Bath Abbey, but he was buried at Batheaston.<br>
