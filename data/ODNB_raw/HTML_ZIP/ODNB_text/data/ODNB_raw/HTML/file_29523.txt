<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  John</span>  (1777&#150;1846), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in January 1777 and baptized on 10 February 1777 at Bunbury, Cheshire, the only son of William Williams (<i>d</i>. 1813), vicar of Bunbury, and his wife, Ester, daughter of John Richardson of Beeston, Cheshire. He was said to be descended from an ancient Merioneth family. Williams was educated at Manchester grammar school, which he entered on 26 June 1787, and where he was remembered as sound and industrious rather than brilliant. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1794, being elected a scholar in 1796. He graduated BA in 1798, was elected fellow of Trinity in 1800, and took his MA in 1801.<br>
<br>Williams entered the Inner Temple in 1797 and was called to the bar in 1804, joining the northern circuit and the Lancaster and Chester sessions, and joining Lincoln's Inn in 1813. His choice of the northern circuit and his adherence to the Liberal Party were considered &#145;bold steps&#146; at the time, professional competition being keen on the large northern circuit, and the prospect of promotion small among opponents of the government. Williams did not acquire a first-rate practice, but he took great care to get to the root of his cases, and it was said that Mr Baron Bayley more than once declared that &#145;if he were to be tried for his life he should desire to be defended by Mr. Williams&#146;.<br>
<br>Williams made his name at the bar as junior counsel for the defence at the trial of Queen Caroline in 1820. His strength as an advocate lay in his treatment of witnesses, as he demonstrated in his cross-examination of Louise Demont, one of the queen's maids, which, together with his speech at the opening of the defence, was commended by his leaders, Henry Brougham and Thomas Denman.<br>
<br>Williams was returned to parliament for the city of Lincoln at a by-election on 23 March 1822. He sat for that constituency until he was returned for Ilchester in 1826, and sat for Winchelsea from 1830 until the borough was disenfranchised in 1832. He was an effective speaker in the House of Commons, where he made it his business, with Michael Angelo Taylor and others, to attack Lord Eldon and the delays and expenses of the court of chancery. His motions on the subject led to the appointment of the chancery commission of 1825 which reported in 1826, though without effective result.<br>
<br>Williams's political conduct was prejudicial to his professional advancement, but when the whigs joined Canning in office in 1827 he became king's counsel; and on the accession of William IV he became first solicitor-general, and then attorney-general to Queen Adelaide, in the place of Brougham and Denman, who became lord chancellor and lord chief justice respectively. On 28 February 1834 Williams was created serjeant-at-law, and appointed a baron of the exchequer. He sat in the exchequer for one term, and having been knighted on 16 April 1834 was appointed a justice of the court of king's bench to replace Sir James Parke (afterwards Lord Wensleydale).<br>
<br>Williams did not have a profound knowledge of the law, or judicial talents of the very highest order, but he was sincere and earnest in his desire to administer justice and was admired both <i>in banco</i> and at <i>nisi prius</i>. His initial ignorance of the details of practice led him to refuse to grant orders of course, but this difficulty was soon overcome. He was below middle height, and appeared severe, but this was not his true character and he was well liked by both the bar and his fellow judges. He wrote occasionally for the <span class="italic">Law Review</span>, and was a distinguished classical scholar, contributing several articles on the Greek orators to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>.<br>
<br>Williams married Harriet Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1861), only surviving daughter of Davies Davenport of Capethorne, near Congleton, his father's friend and patron. There were no children. He died at his house, Livermore Park in Suffolk, on 15 September 1846. His death was attributed to &#145;angina pectoris&#146; or to &#145;gout in the stomach&#146;. He was buried in Temple Church on 23 September 1846.<br>
