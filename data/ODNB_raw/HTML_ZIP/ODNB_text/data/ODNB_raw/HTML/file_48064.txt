<span class="headword">Mitchell, Sir  Henry</span>  (1824&#150;1898), <span class="occ">textile merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born in November 1824 at Esholt, near Bradford, Yorkshire, the son of Matthew Harper Mitchell, a small local textile manufacturer, and his wife, Ann. He went to a local elementary school, and at the age of fourteen entered his father's worsted mill to learn the principles of textile manufacture. In 1841 he was taken on by the worsted firm of William Fison &amp; Co. Seven years later he moved as a buyer to the Bradford firm of A. and S. Henry &amp; Co., of which he was made a partner in 1852, and with which he was associated for the rest of his life, gaining a reputation, with Jacob Behrens, as one of the chief authorities on the worsted trade, and achieving a very influential position within that trade. Mitchell married, in 1851, Annie, daughter of the Revd D. W. Gordon of Earlston in Scotland. They had three sons: Gordon, who became a successful merchant in South Africa; Henry, who became a sergeant-major in the guards; and Samuel. Annie died in 1886 following a long period of mental illness.<br>
<br>The firm of A. and S. Henry was one of the major mercantile houses in the transatlantic textile trade, having been founded in Manchester in 1804 by the brothers Alexander and Samuel Henry. The beginnings of the business perhaps lay in the emigration to America in 1783 of their uncle, Alexander Henry, who had been born in the north of Ireland in 1766. He became a clerk in Philadelphia, but soon developed a successful merchanting business, importing cloth from Britain. The firm retained strong commercial links with America and traded in all types of textiles. It established branch warehouses in Leeds, Huddersfield, Bradford, Belfast, and Glasgow, which by the 1840s were operating with a degree of autonomy. Samuel died on 13 January 1840 in a fire on the American steamer <i>Lexington</i> sailing from New York to Providence, Rhode Island. Alexander died in 1862. By 1848 the business was in the control of Alexander's two sons, John Snowden Henry and Mitchell Henry, but neither was very actively involved. The management of the Bradford branch of the business was in the hands of Henry Mitchell from the 1850s, at a time when the worsted trade was expanding very rapidly. He travelled regularly to America, and gained a widespread commercial reputation, expanding the business considerably as the main branch of A. and S. Henry. The company was converted to limited liability status in 1889, with a capital of about &pound;1 million.<br>
<br>Although from an Anglican family, Henry Mitchell converted to Wesleyanism, staunchly supporting the church, and contributing financially to local Wesleyan chapels and schools. He also supported a variety of other local activities, and is reported to have donated over &pound;100,000 to philanthropic causes in Bradford during his lifetime. He championed the promotion of technical education, believing that continental success in industry had benefited greatly from technical schools there. He helped found the Bradford Technical College between 1878 and 1882, providing substantial donations to it. He served as a governor of the Bradford school board and Bradford grammar school, and as vice-president of the Bradford Mechanics' Institute. He was knighted in 1887 for his services to education.<br>
<br>Mitchell was a strong supporter of the interests of the worsted trade, not least through his service to Bradford chamber of commerce, of which he was president for six years. He was one of the main witnesses, on behalf of Bradford, to the royal commission on depression in trade and industry in 1886, providing detailed evidence on the state of the Bradford worsted trade. He was critical of the services provided by British consuls; campaigned for improvements in rail transport; and supported &#145;fair trade&#146;, rather than free trade, arguing for reciprocal arrangements in trading relations and, at times, advocating commercial retaliation, as for example, to the proposed new French tariff in 1890. He served as a judge at the important Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876; an exhibition that many Bradford manufacturers boycotted in protest at United States protectionist policy. In 1878 he was vice-president of the jurors for worsted yarn and fabrics at the Paris Universal Exhibition, and wrote a perceptive report about it.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Mitchell died at his home, Parkfield House, Manningham, Bradford, on 27 April 1898, after a long illness, a few days after he had been made a freeman of the city of Bradford. He was buried at Undercliffe cemetery, Bradford, on 30 April.<br>
