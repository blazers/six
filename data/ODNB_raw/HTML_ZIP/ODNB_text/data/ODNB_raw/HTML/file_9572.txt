<span class="headword">Fitzgerald, Sir  John Forster</span>  (1784/5&#150;1877), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was a younger son of Edward Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1815) of Carrigoran, co. Clare, who sat for that county in the Irish parliament and was a colonel of Irish Volunteers in 1782, and his second wife, the daughter and coheir of Major Thomas Burton, 5th dragoon guards, and granddaughter of the Rt Hon. John Forster, lord chief justice of Ireland, and consequently was younger brother of the first two baronets of Carrigoran.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1793 Fitzgerald was appointed ensign in Captain Shee's independent company of foot in Ireland, and became lieutenant in January 1794. In May 1794 he was given a half-pay company in the former 79th (Royal Liverpool volunteers) regiment, which had been disbanded before he was born. After seven years as a titular captain on the Irish half-pay list, on 31 October 1800 he was brought into the 46th foot, and joined the corps, then consisting of two strong battalions of short-service soldiers, in Ireland. The regiment was much reduced following the peace of Amiens, and Fitzgerald was again placed on half pay, but the year after was brought on full pay again in the newly raised New Brunswick fencibles, in which he was senior captain and brevet major.<br>
<br>In 1809 Fitzgerald was promoted major in the 60th Royal Americans (later the 60th rifles) and in 1810 became brevet lieutenant-colonel. He joined the 5th or J&auml;ger battalion, 60th, in the Peninsula, and was present at the storming of Badajoz (where he was among the regimental commanding officers specially commended by Sir Thomas Picton), at Salamanca, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, and many minor actions. Part of the time he was in command of a provisional battalion of light companies, and in the Pyrenees commanded a brigade and was taken prisoner by the French, but exchanged. At the end of the war he was made CB and decorated. He accompanied the 5th battalion, 60th, from the south of France to Ireland in 1814, and from there in 1816 to the Mediterranean. In 1818 it was brought home from Gibraltar and disbanded, Fitzgerald, then senior major, with most of the other officers and men, being transferred to the 2nd battalion, 60th, at Quebec, which then became the 1st battalion and was made rifles. Fitzgerald, who became brevet colonel in 1819, remained some years in Canada, most of the time as commandant of Quebec, and afterwards of Montreal.<br>
<br>On 5 February 1824 Fitzgerald took command of the 20th in Bombay, which he held until promoted to major-general in 1830. He was made KCB the year after. In 1838 he was appointed to a divisional command at Madras, but was afterwards transferred to Bombay, and commanded a division of the Bombay army until his promotion to lieutenant-general in November 1841. He was colonel of 85th (1840&#150;43), colonel of 62nd (1843), transferred to colonelcy 18th Royal Irish (1850), general (1854), GCB (1862), and field marshal (29 May 1875). He was Liberal MP for County Clare from 1852 to 1857, when he was defeated.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald married first, in New Brunswick, in 1805, Charlotte, daughter of the Hon. Robert Hazen of Saint John, New Brunswick, with whom he had a son, John Forster Fitzgerald&#151;killed as a captain 14th light dragoons in the Second Anglo-Sikh War&#151;and two daughters. He married second, in 1839, Jean (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of the Hon. Donald Ogilvy of Clova, formerly of the Madras army and afterwards colonel Forfarshire militia; they had children.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald, who some short time before had been received into the Roman Catholic communion, died at his home, 43 rue Sebastopol, Tours, France, on 24 March 1877, the oldest officer in the British army. By order of the French minister of war, the garrison of Tours paid him the funeral honours prescribed for a marshal of France. He was buried in St Symphorien cemetery, Tours, on 27 March 1877.<br>
