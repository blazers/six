<span class="headword">Stuart <span class="st"> [Stewart]</span>,  John <span class="st"> [Hans]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1550, <em>d.</em> 1618), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland, the eldest son of John Stewart of Ochiltree and his wife, Agneta Forbes, the daughter of Robert Forbes and Anna Sinclair. It seems clear that his family was in some way related to that of the Stewart lords Ochiltree, but an exact connection has proved impossible to establish. John Stuart's father is believed to have accompanied Mary, queen of Scots, to France in the 1550s, serving there as a colonel for Fran&ccedil;ois II before returning to Scotland in 1560; Stuart himself probably gained his education in France, and visited Germany and other European countries on his travels. Before 1564 he was back in Scotland, as that year he sailed from Edinburgh towards Danzig. However, his ship was captured by Danes, who were embroiled in the Nordic Seven Years' War against Sweden, and Stuart was imprisoned in Varberg on suspicion of wanting to enter Swedish military service. Varberg was seized by Swedish forces in August, and all the Scottish troops in the Danish army were forcibly placed under Swedish command. Stuart was then stripped of his moneys by Swedish troops and moved to a prison in Uppsala, presumably as the Swedes were not certain about his status. It was through the efforts of other Scottish officers already in Swedish service that he was finally released.<br>
<br>It is not certain exactly when Stuart decided to stay in Sweden, where he was known as Hans, although he is recorded as master of horse of Erik XIV, who reigned from 1560 to 1568. He then entered the service of the duke of S&ouml;dermanland, king of Sweden as Karl IX from 1599 to 1611. Similarly it is unknown when Stuart married Brita Eriksdotter (<i>d</i>. 1622), both of whose parents were of noble Swedish stock. As was required of foreigners aspiring to marry into the Swedish nobility, Stuart provided evidence of his noble origins in a letter to Johan III and his brother Duke Karl dated 12 October 1579 and signed by Earl Collins of Ergadie (Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll), the chancellor of Scotland, Earl Robert Stuart of Levenox (Robert Stewart, earl of Lennox), and Andrew Stuart of Ochiltree (perhaps his brother). Stuart obtained another letter, dated 14 June 1585, from James VI, allowing him to use the Ochiltree coat of arms at the request of James Stewart, earl of Arran. Duke Karl had already endowed Stuart with land in S&ouml;dermanland in 1579, which he exchanged for land in Hedenlunda in 1582; in 1610 he obtained rights of inheritance for himself, his wife, and his male descendants. Hedenlunda remained the Stewart family seat in Sweden for the next two centuries.<br>
<br>In 1604 Stuart was a gentleman of the chamber of Karl IX, and he soon became the colonel of a regiment he had raised himself in Scotland. By 1609 he was not only the quartermaster-general and the war commissioner-general, but also the muster-general of all the foreign soldiers in Sweden. He was sent to Russia as an envoy during the Swedish campaign there of 1609&#150;10, but after that little is known of him until his death in Sweden in October 1618. He had five children, four of whom survived him. Both of his sons, Anders the younger and David, became gentlemen of the chamber of Gustavus Adolphus. Stuart's wife died in March 1622 and they were both buried in Vadsbro church. Stuart's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63440/', "Andrew (Anders) Stuart (c.1570&#150;1640)")</script> also entered Swedish service and became a colonel. They were the first Stewarts known to have emigrated to Sweden in the sixteenth century.<br>
