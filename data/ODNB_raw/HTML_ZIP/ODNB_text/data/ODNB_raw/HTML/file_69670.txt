<span class="headword">Cottnam <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>How]</span>,  Deborah</span>  (<em>c.</em>1727&#150;1806), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was born probably at Canso, Nova Scotia, the only daughter of the four known children born to Edward How (<i>c</i>.1702&#150;1750), merchant and JP, and his first wife, who died <i>c</i>.1743. Deborah's father subsequently married Mary Magdalen Winniett on 9 July 1744 in Annapolis. Deborah spent her childhood in Canso, an isolated fishing community and garrison outpost located on the far north-eastern tip of peninsular Nova Scotia. Her father was a prominent citizen in the community, as its principal merchant, JP, and militia officer, and was also an influential interlocutor with French and Mi'kmaq interests throughout the region; his frequent travels and the family's strong Massachusetts ties&#151;the children may have been partly educated in the Boston area&#151;brought a certain rough ambience to the household. About 1742 Deborah married Ensign Samuel Cottnam (<i>d</i>. 1780) of the 40th foot; their first child, Martha Grace, was eleven days old when Canso fell to the French in May 1744. The settlement was burnt and the garrison families were taken prisoner to the fortress at Louisbourg, &Icirc;le Royale (Cape Breton Island), from where they were soon discharged to Boston.<br>
<br>Little is known about Mrs Cottnam's activities in the next three decades. Her husband, who was promoted captain, was present at the second fall of Louisbourg in 1758 and remained there until 1760, when he resigned his commission on grounds of ill health. From 1764 he worked as a merchant in Salem, Massachusetts, but in 1773 he and his family moved to Nova Scotia, where they lived probably in Windsor, with Martha Grace, who by that time had married Winckworth Tonge. Mrs Cottnam and her unmarried daughter Grissey Eliza returned to Salem where, by July 1774, they had opened a school for young ladies. The onset of war prompted them to move to Halifax, where their &#145;Female Academy&#146; was once more in business by 1777. Their boarding- and day school educated the daughters of colonial officers and loyalist gentry; among its pupils were the daughters of Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres and of the Revd Dr Mather Byles. The curriculum centred on reading, writing, arithmetic, and French, but dancing and sewing were also taught. Under Grissey's supervision the girls were instructed in both practical and decorative needlework; their intellectual studies included topics such as &#145;Locke upon inate ideas&#146;  (Byles MSS, Rebecca Byles, 20 Feb 1784). It is clear that Mrs Cottnam provided her pupils with a stimulating intellectual education; Rebecca Byles, for one, was &#145;imploy'd in translating a very long Sermon &hellip; from French into English; &amp; in reading <span class="roman">Pamela</span> and Terences Plays in French; [also] in hearing Popes Homer&#146;  (ibid., 6 Jan 1779). Mrs Cottnam certainly seems to have earned both respect and admiration from her pupils. Her few surviving letters reveal a loquacious correspondent who was alive to the world around her, and her poems display a dignified verse style in the classical tradition of the time. Rebecca Byles contrasted her own experience with what she regarded as the poor education received by boys in the colonies, and concluded:<blockquote>Girls &hellip; have the best Education the place affords, and the accomplishment of their Minds is attended to as well as the adorning of their persons; in a few years I expect to see Women fill the most important Offices in Church and State. (ibid., 24 March 1784)</blockquote>The Cottnam family finances were always precarious. Early property investments in Nova Scotia and Massachusetts were either sold for debt or lost to the vicissitudes of war. Following Samuel's death in 1780 Mrs Cottnam petitioned the Nova Scotia government for additional land, citing her late husband's &#145;avow'd [loyalist] principles &amp; fix'd attachment to Government&#146;  (land MSS, 1785). She received 1000 acres, but in a remote location which she could neither settle on nor sell profitably. The unsupportive attitude of the Halifax establishment no doubt persuaded her to accept the invitation from some loyalist families in Saint John, New Brunswick, to open a school there in 1786. She and Grissey were happier in Saint John but their financial problems continued; Grissey regretted that her mother was &#145;reduced at her year to the dreadful necessity of earning a scanty subsistence &hellip; in keeping a school &hellip; with difficulty gaining a sufficiency to live with decency&#146;  (How MSS, vol. 474, 241). Their fortunes improved a little in 1793, following the death of Edward How's widow, whose annual &pound;100 government pension was transferred to Mrs Cottnam. Mrs Cottnam had returned to Halifax by 1794 and her final years were spent quietly within the family circle at Windsor, where she died on 31 December 1806 and was buried in the Old Parish Burying-Ground. Her obituary in the <span class="italic">New Brunswick Royal Gazette</span> (21 January 1807) noted that she had &#145;taught girls for forty years&#146;; although the exact date of when she started teaching remains uncertain, it is clear that her career exemplified the best of the dame-school tradition in colonial America.<br>
