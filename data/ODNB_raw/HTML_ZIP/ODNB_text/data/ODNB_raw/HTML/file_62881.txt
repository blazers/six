<span class="headword">McGill,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1734), <span class="occ">mason and architect</span>, was the son of George McGill, minister of Arbirlot in Forfarshire (<i>c</i>.1641&#150;1691&times;1702), and his wife, Margaret Guthrie. In 1697 he was apprenticed to Alexander Nisbet, an Edinburgh mason with strong professional connections in Forfarshire. Nisbet was also married to a Mary McGill (<i>d</i>. 1692), which may imply some family connection. Apart from these details, McGill's early life and training are obscure.<br>
<br>Nisbet was a member of the trades' incorporation in Edinburgh and McGill's name might have been expected to emerge in its membership rolls by <i>c</i>.1703. Instead, he first appears as a mason, independent of Nisbet, as early as 1701, at Kellie Castle, near Dundee. For whatever reason, his formative years were not influenced solely by his mason's training and from an early stage in his career he made use of other connections, so that by the time he was admitted to the Edinburgh masons' lodge in 1710 it was as an &#145;architector&#146; rather than a stone mason.<br>
<br>One possibility is that McGill's career was influenced by his connection with James Maule, fourth earl of Panmure, who was the patron of Arbirlot parish. Kellie Castle belonged to the earl's brother Harry Maule of Kellie, and McGill collaborated on alterations to this property (1699&#150;1705) with Alexander Edward, an Episcopalian minister who was closely associated with the Panmures and who turned to architecture after the revolution of 1688. It is possible that Edward and McGill already knew each other, having lived in the same area, but the importance of the Edward connection is that the minister was also associated with Sir William Bruce of Kinross, and McGill was thus linked with this key architectural figure from an early stage of his career. In 1708 McGill worked on the latter stages of Craigiehall, a small house on the outskirts of Edinburgh designed by Bruce and an important precursor to Hopetoun House near by. McGill was also involved in Bruce's very last project, House of Nairne, Perthshire, designed partly by the countess of Atholl with advice from Bruce and Edward, and taken over by McGill after Bruce's death in 1710. In the Craigiehall project McGill worked with John Erskine, twenty-second or sixth earl of Mar, the leading aristocratic amateur architect in Scotland at that time. He continued to be associated with Mar even after the latter's exile after the Jacobite rising of 1715.<br>
<br>McGill was also closely associated with James Smith, another major figure in Scottish architecture in this period, who established himself as the main architectural rival to Bruce by the 1690s. McGill and Smith worked together on Yester House (Haddingtonshire) for the marquess of Tweeddale, <i>c</i>.1700&#150;1715. The design for this very elaborate house is mainly credited to Smith, but McGill was responsible for a number of houses on his own that are distinctive and interesting in their own right, notably Blair Drummond in Perthshire (1715&#150;17) and Donibristle in Fife (1719&#150;23). McGill shared Bruce's interest in the wider setting of the house, both in the design of landscapes, for Hugh Campbell, third earl of Loudoun, at Loudon Castle in Ayrshire in 1716, and in a concern with the architectural setting of courts and pavilions around the house. At both Blair Drummond and Donibristle he combined a series of simple and functional elements to make highly formal and monumental layouts of courtyards and pavilions. At Donibristle, in particular, this includes a dramatic series of terraces between the house and the River Forth, to the south.<br>
<br>McGill was first city architect of Edinburgh between 1720 and 1725. It was a significant post for a number of reasons. First, the city chose someone from outside the incorporation of trades and the emphasis was on his status as an architect rather than an operative mason. Second, it connects McGill with the beginnings of the great eighteenth-century project of improvement in Edinburgh, best exemplified by the New Town, but which also involved a whole series of social and economic improvements, many of which required architectural changes to the city. One of the key figures behind this scheme was Lord Provost George Drummond, who became city treasurer in 1717 at the very time that McGill was finishing Blair Drummond for George Drummond, the namesake and kinsman of the Edinburgh treasurer. Using the proceeds of an ale tax, the treasurer set out a substantial programme of improvements with McGill as architectural adviser from 1718, before his official appointment; the architect continued to advise the city on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis even after his salary of &pound;50 per annum became more than the city could afford and the post was suspended. His work ranged from water supply and other infrastructure improvements to a new charity workhouse and a colony of houses and workshops for French weavers brought to the city in the 1720s to initiate a trade in cambric. His most important contribution to the city, however, was undoubtedly Greyfriars Kirk: partially destroyed in an explosion in 1718, it was expanded and remodelled by McGill to provide accommodation for two congregations between 1719 and 1723.<br>
<br>McGill's career was ultimately eclipsed by that of William Adam, who rose to prominence in the 1720s and dominated Scottish architecture for the next thirty years. However, McGill is a significant figure as, like Adam, he represents the move towards the architectural profession and away from the craft of the mason, and because he is associated with the early impulse towards improvement in Edinburgh. He died in Edinburgh in May 1734 and was survived by his wife, Margaret Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1736).<br>
