<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Broadbent]</span>,  Marian Sutton</span>  (1846&#150;1901), <span class="occ">secretary and trade unionist</span>, was born at Lockwood, Huddersfield, in Yorkshire on 12 September 1846, the daughter of William Broadbent, tea dealer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thornton. After her father's death she went with her mother to New Zealand. Returning to Britain, she married, at Camberwell on 1 June 1870, Thomas Sutton Marshall (1834&#150;1910), deputy assistant commissary general at the War Office and a member of a military family. The marriage did not last, however, and they separated. Being obliged to support herself, she took the advice of the novelist Charles Reade to follow the new career of &#145;type-writing&#146; and did her first piece of professional work for him. In 1884 she established the Ladies Type-Writing Office, probably the first of its kind, in Chancery Lane, London, and later moved her business, which was prospering, to 126 Strand. Among her clients was Oscar Wilde, who later wanted her to oversee the copying of his prison letter <span class="italic">De Profundis</span>, for &#145;Mrs Marshall can be relied on&#146;  (20 July 1897; <span class="italic">Letters of Oscar Wilde</span>, 624). She was a founder member of the Society (later the National Union) of Typists in June 1889 and wrote for its small membership, which included both employers and employed and had the character of a craft guild. Her own standards of accuracy and speed in secretarial work (including shorthand which she thought should be taught routinely to children) were very high; she looked for intelligence and an excellent level of both general and special education in women workers. Adequate payment at standard rates to prevent undercutting and proper sanitary conditions where women were employed were her chief concerns as a unionist. She was an able speaker and organizer, and photographs indicate a woman of poise. The Society of Arts made her its first examiner in type-writing in 1891 and she held that position until her death, and also examined for the London chamber of commerce. She published a short pamphlet of examples in 1892 entitled <span class="italic">Practical Type-Writing Cards for Use in Offices and Schools</span>, of which a copy survives in the British Library.<br>
<br>In the same year Mrs Marshall moved to Cambridge: &#145;I have no fear for the future; good work and punctuality will tell here as much as they did in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Phonographer</span>, Aug 1892). She was proud of her competence in deciphering technical matter in what she politely called &#145;hurried&#146; handwriting and her office was soon patronized by senior members of the university, and thanks to them it was granted the title of the Cambridge University Type-Writing Office in July 1898 by the vice-chancellor. She introduced a Remington typewriter with Greek characters for classical texts and extended her service to library research. She was a steady though not a headline-making member of the Women's Suffrage Society and represented the Liberal women of Cambridge at the International Congress of Women Workers held in London in 1899, when she spoke at length on the personal qualities she looked for in employees and on business training. &#145;To train for a teachership in a high-class commercial school ought to be looked upon as one of the most favourable openings for highly educated women, and one in which their talents will find a remarkable and gratifying outlet&#146;  (countess of Aberdeen, 4.118).<br>
<br>Mrs Marshall's health failed rapidly and she was forced to sell the Cambridge business in the spring of 1900 to her pupil Miss Minnie Pate. She returned to London, where she had arranged to act as private secretary for G. P. Gooch, then a young historian of independent means and sympathetic to female suffrage, whose family were long-standing friends. She also joined the local women's Liberal organization. With her funds almost exhausted, she faced death supported by a firm religious faith and among friends with &#145;my mind at peace with all the world&#146;  (Greenwood, 220). Mrs Marshall died of cancer at 61 Hamlet Gardens Mansions, Ravenscourt Park, London, on 7 April 1901 aged fifty-three and was buried in Hammersmith old cemetery on 10 April. No monument was erected on her grave.<br>
