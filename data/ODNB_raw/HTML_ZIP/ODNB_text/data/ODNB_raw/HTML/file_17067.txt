<span class="headword">Lovett,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1692, <em>d.</em> 1780), <span class="occ">writer on electricity</span>, was baptized on 31 July 1692 at Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, the son of Richard Lovet, member of a landed family long established in the district. On 25 November 1722 he was admitted to a lay clerkship in Worcester Cathedral, and retained this position until his death. The name of his wife is not known; a son, Timothy, a pupil at Worcester Infirmary, predeceased him. Lovett witnessed the lectures given by J. T. Desaguliers in 1739, which included simple demonstrations of electrical phenomena. From about 1750, when he was able to obtain a friction machine, electricity became Lovett's main interest. He read widely, in particular the works of Benjamin Franklin, and wrote a number of books and pamphlets for the benefit of his provincial neighbours.<br>
<br>Lovett's interest soon concentrated on the medical effects of electricity and his books included lists of those afflicted by a wide variety of ailments and disabilities; he claimed to have cured many of these or at least to have alleviated their suffering. In 1758 he advertised himself as able to effect cures, especially of a sore throat, by electricity. His first book was <span class="italic">The subtil medium prov'd, or, That &hellip; power &hellip; call'd sometimes aether, but oftener elementary fire, verify'd</span> (1756): it was savaged in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> of December 1756, and Lovett was condemned as ill-educated, ignorant of his subject, and adding nothing beyond the lengthy title, a view echoed by Augustus De Morgan in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> of 1863.<br>
<br>While this criticism was justified, Lovett, with his &#145;electrical fluid&#146;, was only one of many would-be natural philosophers seeking to explain effects for which adequate concepts and vocabulary did not yet exist. Lovett responded in 1759 with <span class="italic">Sir Isaac Newton's aether realised, or, The second part of the subtil medium proved and electricity rendered useful</span>, in which he admitted a lack of polite education and contested at length the arguments made against him. His <span class="italic">Philosophical essays &hellip; containing an enquiry into the nature and properties of the electrical fluid etc.</span> (1766) contained lengthy extracts from the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society and from the works of Franklin, and drew praise from the editor of <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> in October 1766, who considered it &#145;evidently a work of genius&#146;  (Chambers, 364). In 1774 Lovett published <span class="italic">The electrical philosopher: containing a new system of physics, founded upon the principle of an universal plenum of elementary fire</span>. This was cast as a dialogue, which Lovett considered the easiest form to convey his unfamiliar material to local uneducated readers, whom he sought to impress with copious extracts ranging from Newton and Franklin to minor writers on electrical science. In the latter part of the book Lovett dealt with what he considered to be related effects: lightning, magnetism, earthquakes, gravity, and motion. In reaction to the criticism voiced against his <span class="italic">Philosophical Essays</span>, he appended &#145;a postscript containing strictures upon the uncandid animadversions of the monthly reviewers on those essays&#146;. He died on 8 June 1780 and was buried on 11 June at St Swithin's Church, Worcester.<br>
