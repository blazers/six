<span class="headword">Gibson,  Reginald Oswald</span>  (1902&#150;1983), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 30 September 1902 in Dulwich, London, the only child of Samuel Gibson, civil servant, and his wife, Ethel Crowther. From Wilson's Grammar School in Camberwell he won a scholarship to St Dunstan's College, and from there in 1921 he entered the honours school of chemistry at University College, London. He obtained a first-class BSc degree and in 1925 took a junior research post at Leiden University. In the autumn of the following year he joined Brunner Mond &amp; Co. as a research chemist at Winnington in Cheshire, and at about that time acquired his nickname, Hoot. (Hoot Gibson was a character in the Wild West films of the 1920s.)<br>
<br>In 1927 Gibson introduced his friend and research collaborator, Anton Michels of the University of Amsterdam, to his colleagues in what was by then ICI. This led to Gibson's being seconded in 1928 to work with Michels on the properties of gases at high pressures, and to ICI's becoming interested in the chemical effects of high pressures; this became the theme of Gibson's work on his return to Winnington in 1931.<br>
<br>Gibson was joined in this research by Eric William Fawcett (1908&#150;1987). On Friday 24 March 1933 they set up an experiment in which ethylene and benzaldehyde were pressurized to 1900 atmospheres at 170 &deg;C in the hope that they would combine together. They did not, but when the apparatus was dismantled on the Monday Fawcett noticed that the tip of a steel tube was coated with a waxy substance. This small deposit, less than half a gram, was the first solid polymer of ethylene ever made&#151;polythene. However, Gibson and Fawcett's apparatus was primitive and the reaction could not be controlled. It was another two years before a different team took up the work again. Polythene finally went into production in 1939, and immediately played a crucial role, enabling radar equipment to be deployed effectively in the battle of Britain. In 1937 Gibson married Lesley Shena, daughter of William George Randles, barrister. They had a daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Gibson was in charge of process work at an ICI factory making anti-knock additives for aviation fuel. After the war this activity was transferred to the Associated Ethyl Company, and in 1948 Gibson left ICI to become that company's chief chemist. The post-war years saw an enormous expansion of the business, and Gibson became research and development manager with a team of some 150 staff. A long illness caused him to relinquish his management role, but he returned to work as scientific adviser until his retirement in 1963.<br>
<br>Gibson was a patient and thorough man. All his work was carefully thought out and executed with minute attention to detail. In addition to his research career he played a full part in local and professional affairs, holding office in the United Nations Association, the Chester Sailing Club, and the Royal Institute of Chemistry (RIC). His chairman's address to the institute's north-west section on the discovery of polythene became no. 1 in the RIC lecture series (1964). The highlight of Gibson's final year was the polyethylenes 1933&#150;83 golden jubilee conference in London in June. He died the following month, at the Royal Naval Hospital, Plymouth, on 22 July 1983.<br>
