<span class="headword">Bourn,  Samuel</span>  (1648&#150;1720), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Derby, the son and grandson of clothiers who had &#145;spent considerable sums &hellip; contriving engines&#146; to supply the town with water  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, preface), although his parent's names are unknown. These expenses might have hindered Bourn's education had not his uncle Robert Seddon (1629&#150;1696), the ejected vicar of Kirk Langley, Derbyshire, taken care to send him to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1671. Unwilling to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, Bourn left the university without a degree in 1672 and returned to Derby, where he served as a schoolteacher and afterwards as chaplain to Lady Hatton. He was probably ordained as a presbyterian later that decade while living with a Bourn aunt in London. In 1679, through the influence of the London divine Samuel Annesley, he became pastor of the presbyterian congregation at Calne, Wiltshire, at an annual salary of less than &pound;10. Here he remained for the next sixteen years despite receiving more lucrative offers from churches in Bath, Durham, and Lincoln. Between 1690 and 1695 the London Common Fund awarded him yearly grants, ranging from &pound;6 to &pound;8, to encourage his ministry. Shortly after his arrival in Wiltshire he married the daughter of the Revd George Scortwreth (<i>d</i>. 1659), of Lincoln. Bourn left Calne in 1696, when the dying Seddon recommended him as his successor at Bolton, Lancashire. Initially unpopular with all save the &#145;most judicious and serious&#146;, Bourn nevertheless resisted calls to return to his former flock at a higher salary. Gradually, &#145;by his great integrity and inoffensive behaviour&#146;, he won over the entire Bolton congregation, which later that year built him a new meeting-house, the Bank Street Chapel, on land given by Seddon  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Bourn excelled in the pulpit, according to his son and namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3000/', "Samuel Bourn (1689&#150;1754)")</script>. If in prayer his &#145;grimaces &hellip; were somewhat peculiar &hellip; [and] might perhaps be disagreeable to strangers&#146;, he preached as became an orator; in his voice was a &#145;mixture of softness and vehemence &hellip; which tended at once to convince and ravish the souls of the hearers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 3.12&#150;13). William Tong (1662&#150;1727), a native of Bolton, who contributed a short memoir to Bourn's posthumous sermons, likewise thought him &#145;one of the best preachers that ever I heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, preface). Considering the meagreness of his stipend, Bourn's charity was as exemplary as his preaching. His success in pleading for the needy earned him a reputation as &#145;the best beggar in Bolton&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 3. 25). He not only helped found a school there for twenty poor children, but eventually bore the cost of its maintenance himself. His benefactions culminated in a bequest of &pound;20 to support a weekly lecture in Bolton, as large a legacy as he left to any of his children.<br>
<br>Tragedy struck Bourn's family in 1701 when three of his seven children died, including his eldest son, Joseph, aged twenty-one. His own health had been declining for several years, under the strain of unwearied study and constant preaching, before he died at Bolton on 4 March 1720  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist Register</span>, 280). His widow had also suffered &#145;under great decays &hellip; of old age&#146;, though &#145;not without some lucid intervals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, preface). On his deathbed Bourn expressed complete satisfaction with his nonconformist principles. His son Samuel, who had already arrived in Bolton to preach at one funeral, stayed to deliver his father's funeral sermon as well. In 1722 he published this discourse, on <span class="roman">2 Kings</span> 2: 3, along with two sets of the elder Bourn's sermons, &#145;The transforming vision of Christ&#146; and &#145;The Believer's Hope &hellip; the Reason and Motive of Real Holiness&#146;. He dedicated this volume, his father's only printed work, to a relative, Madam Hacker of Duffield, Derbyshire, wife of Mr Hacker, perhaps the son of the regicide <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11835/', "Francis Hacker")</script>. The inclusion of a recommendatory preface by William Tong, a staunch Calvinist, is curious, for he and Bourn's heterodox son, who refused to subscribe to the Westminster assembly's catechism at his ordination, were strange bedfellows indeed. Naturally each offered his own distinctive interpretation of the deceased, making it difficult now to characterize Bourn's theological position. While Tong emphasized his abhorrence of recent departures from traditional Reformed teaching, the younger Bourn minimized his father's attachment to any particular human creeds: men were judged not by the orthodoxy of &#145;their opinions, but by their hearts and lives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 2.50). Both men did agree that, whatever Bourn's doctrinal leanings, tolerance towards those of differing views and an insistence upon &#145;moral righteousness&#146; constituted the core of his divinity  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 3.8). Another Samuel Bourn (<i>d</i>. 1742), minister of the Presbyterian meeting at Epping, Essex, was a subscriber at the Salters' Hall debate in 1719.<br>
