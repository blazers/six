<span class="headword">Pote,  Joseph</span>  (1704&#150;1787), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was born in the parish of St Clement Danes, London, the son of Joseph Pote (<i>d</i>. 1716), staymaker, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Booden or Bowden), and was baptized in that parish in March 1704. Joseph was apprenticed to Daniel Brown, bookseller, on 4 August 1718 and almost as soon as he was out of his apprenticeship on 7 December 1725, he opened his own bookshop &#145;at the Golden Door, over against Suffolk House, Charing Cross&#146;  (Plomer, 201).<br>
<br>In 1729 Pote moved to premises at Isaac Newton's Head, &#145;the corner of Suffolk Street near Charing Cross&#146;  (Plomer, 201). At about the same time, however, he became involved with the bookselling business previously owned by Thomas Bartlet at Eton. Bartlet had died in 1727 and it appears that Pote then helped Bartlet's widow to run the business. At some point Pote married Bartlet's daughter, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1771), and their son Joseph was baptized on 1 February 1730 at St Martin's-in-the-Fields in London. It is not clear when Pote moved permanently to Eton.<br>
<br>Pote published several schoolbooks and classical texts throughout his career but there were also scholarly works aimed at a wider public than the boys at Eton College. Remarkably soon after his arrival in Eton he published <span class="italic">Catalogus almunorum &hellip; de Etona</span> (1730) and later, a revised edition of William Cave's <span class="italic">Historia literaria</span> (1735), and there were a few popular works&#151;<span class="italic">The Foreigner's Guide to London</span> (1728) and the <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Windsor Castle</span> (1749). A new venture began in 1745 when he started a twice-weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Eton Journal, or, Early Intelligencer</span>, with the chief purpose of providing information about the Jacobite rising. The title was changed in 1746 to the <span class="italic">Windsor and Eton Journal</span> and after the battle of Culloden the paper became a weekly.<br>
<br>Publications apart, Pote's main business was bookselling to the scholars at Eton and he soon became well known to members of the college. They used to chant:<blockquote>
<div>Jos[eph] Pote of Eton, a man of great renown,<br>
</div>
<div>Buys a book for sixpence, and sells it for a crown.<br>
</div> (Lyte, 309)</blockquote>He also dealt in stationery (particularly to supply the needs of the college), wallpaper, and patent medicines; and, never one to miss a business opportunity, he ran a small boarding-house for boys.Pote had four sons (Joseph, Thomas, John, and Edward Ephraim) and four daughters (Ann, Catherine, Elizabeth, and Mary). His wife died in 1771 and he married Martha Belk in 1778. His son Joseph became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, while Thomas (who was freed as a member of the Stationers' Company by his father in 1754) helped in the business. In 1769 Pote assigned most of the business to Thomas to devote more time to publishing. Pote died at Eton on 11 March 1787, leaving the business to Thomas, but because of their &#145;unnatural behaviour&#146; to their mother and family, Joseph and Ann were cut off with 5<i>s</i>. each  (will, fol. 194<i>v</i>).<br>
