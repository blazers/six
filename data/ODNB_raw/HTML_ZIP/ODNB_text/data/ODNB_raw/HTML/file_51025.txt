<span class="headword">Eurich,  Richard Ernst</span>  (1903&#150;1992), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 7 Lindum Terrace, Manningham, Bradford, on 14 March 1903, the second child in the family of two sons and three daughters of Frederick William Eurich, bacteriologist, and his wife, Margaret Gwendolyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter-Squire. His father was a celebrated research bacteriologist for the Anthrax Investigation Board and later professor of forensic medicine at the University of Leeds. His ancestors had migrated from Germany to Bradford in the early nineteenth century. Apart from four years boarding at St George's School, Harpenden, Eurich's childhood was spent in the centre of Bradford, a city whose bustling industrial life was to provide a rich visual source for some of his mature art. After two years at Bradford grammar school, his professional artistic training began at Bradford School of Arts and Crafts in 1920; four years later he entered the Slade School of Fine Art (1924&#150;7). His training there under the remarkable professorship of Henry Tonks was almost entirely in drawing, and indeed his earliest successes after he left were with a series of highly finished, often large-scale drawings of figures in interiors. These came to the attention of the collector and founding father of the Contemporary Art Society, Sir Edward Marsh; not only did he buy several of them but he also introduced Eurich to Eric Gill, who, impressed, recommended him to his own gallery, Goupil.<br>
<br>It was at the one-man show that the Goupil Gallery gave him in 1929 that Eurich met the only contemporary artist who ever exerted any major influence on his work: Christopher Wood. At this point Eurich was still uncertain of his future direction and was under doctor's orders to give up drawing because of deteriorating eyesight. Wood's straightforward advice to Eurich at this, their only meeting (Wood died a year later), &#145;to paint the things you love&#146;, changed the course of Eurich's career. For Eurich this came to mean, above all, painting the sea; childhood visits to Whitby and later to cousins at Weymouth, where he struggled to teach himself to paint on the windswept shingle bar of Chesil Beach, had instilled in him a profound fascination with the structure and movement of the sea. The immediate consequence was that he spent winter 1932&#150;3 working in a cottage in Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast, where he evolved a style and subject matter based on coastal scenes and harbours. Lyrical and painterly in character, these brought him considerable success during the 1930s in a series of shows at Rex Nankivell's well-regarded Redfern Gallery. Now earning a steady living as a painter, he married, on 15 September 1934, Mavis Llewellyn Pope (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), art lecturer, and daughter of Frederick John Pope, Methodist minister. After their marriage they went to live at Dibden Purlieu, close to Southampton Water. There they built the house, Appletreewick, in which they lived together until Eurich's death nearly sixty years later.<br>
<br>This pattern of life was sharply interrupted by the Second World War. A Quaker by upbringing, Eurich had strongly pacifist instincts and initially worked as an ambulance driver before an approach from the War Artists' Advisory Committee offered more regular work as a war artist. This came principally through his remarkable painting <span class="italic">Withdrawal from Dunkirk</span> (1940)&#151;a complex, detailed work of astonishing technical assurance, painted in just six weeks only a month or so after the event itself. Exhibited at the National Gallery's war art exhibition in August 1940, it created a public sensation and led to Eurich being appointed a full-time, salaried war artist to the Admiralty in March 1941. There then followed a period of four years' intense work, during which his vividly imagined reconstructions of incidents at sea, shipwreck survivors, and naval raids, painted in a highly idiosyncratic manner that combined elements of J. M. W. Turner and Christopher Wood with Breugel, Cranach, and Northern Renaissance art, won him enormous critical admiration.<br>
<br>A career as an artist recording public events and occasions beckoned but, in the years after the war, Eurich, exhausted by his efforts, turned his back on the prospect and, for a time, on sea subjects also. In the period of introspection that followed he started writing the massive autobiographical memoir that provided later scholars with an insight into his development as an artist. Its rich evocation of his Bradford childhood also provided a new vein of subject matter for his painting, consisting largely of lyrical evocations of childhood together with more surrealistic imaginings of children's stories and folk-songs, as well as more straightforward representations of the Yorkshire landscape of Wharfedale that he had explored as a boy. They were not so popular with the public, however, and Eurich, forced to take up teaching for the first time in his career, worked at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949 to 1968. It was not a role he ever enjoyed particularly, though all the evidence is that he was an extremely conscientious and supportive teacher. Then a highly successful one-man show at Tooth's Gallery in 1968, his first in London for a decade, marked the beginning of a modest but steady revival in his critical fortunes that led to a first retrospective at Bradford Art Gallery in 1980, regular one-man shows at the Fine Art Society, and, in 1991, shortly before his death, an impressive show of his war art at the Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>Eurich continued to work more or less until his death. His late style developed a delicate pale colouring and feathery brushstroke, ideal for rendering the quirky observations of everyday life along nearby Southampton Water and mysterious poetic recollections of the past that formed the basis of his late work. The dedication to painting was typical too of the tenacious individualism of an artist who painted virtually every day of his working life, for the most part in a shed at the bottom of his garden, and only latterly in a purpose-built studio attached to the house. Though there was something of the reclusive in his temperament, there was, equally, nothing misanthropic about it. He was always a man of the sweetest temperament, a spry, sprightly, neatly built figure who drove a car very well right into his late eighties&#151;his only disability in later years being an increasingly serious deafness. This working life was, remarkably, sustained against a private life that involved several personal tragedies: the death of an infant daughter at the end of the war and the deaths of his only son, the gifted documentary photographer Crispin Eurich, in 1977, and, at the same period, of a much loved son-in-law.<br>
<br>Eurich was elected ARA in 1942 and RA in 1953 and appointed OBE in 1984. His work is held in numerous public collections, principally the Tate collection, the National Maritime Museum, and the Imperial War Museum. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bradford University in 1989. He died of cancer of the colon at the Royal South Hampshire Hospital, Southampton, on 6 June 1992. He was survived by his wife, Mavis, and two daughters, Caroline and Philippa.<br>
