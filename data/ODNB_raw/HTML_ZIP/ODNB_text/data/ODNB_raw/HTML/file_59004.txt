<span class="headword">Vaizey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bell; <em>other married name </em>Mansergh]</span>,  Jessie</span>  (1856&#150;1917), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 3 October 1856 at 47 Myrtle Street South, Mount Pleasant, in Liverpool, the second of the seven children of David Bell (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1814), shipping agent and insurance broker, and his wife, Elizabeth Morrish, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barton (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1821); both parents were Scottish. Jessie depicted their happy family life in her semi-autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Salt of Life</span> (1915). She and her elder sister were educated at home by a governess and then by a tutor, who encouraged her youthful writing. She had from childhood told stories to her siblings and in her middle teens won a newspaper short-story competition. She apparently continued to write for pleasure but published nothing until after her first husband's death.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1883, at the parish church of Llangollen, Denbighshire, Wales, Jessie married Henry Mansergh (1852&#150;1894), a cotton broker, and continued living in the more affluent suburbs of Liverpool. A daughter was born in 1886, but the marriage was troubled, possibly by Henry Mansergh's addiction to alcohol or drugs. After his death of kidney disease on 28 May 1894, probably to supplement her income, &#145;Mrs Henry Mansergh&#146; appears in print as the author of short stories and magazine serials, some of which were later published in volume form. Her first book, <span class="italic">A Girl in Springtime</span> (1897), had been serialized in the <span class="italic">Girls' Own Paper</span> as early as August 1894.<br>
<br>Another short-story competition (won with an entry sent in surreptitiously by her young daughter) brought the prize of a cruise to the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt, where Jessie met George de Horne Vaizey (1857&#150;1927), an insurance broker of Essex stock but with a proud strain of Dutch ancestry. They married in Liverpool on 19 March 1898, the circumstances of their meeting giving rise to a family joke that &#145;granny won grandfather in a competition&#146;.<br>
<br>As Mrs George de Horne Vaizey, Jessie continued to write prolifically. She and her husband settled first at Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where their son George (who also became a novelist) was born in 1900. Two years later Jessie contracted typhoid, and was left with a crippling form of arthritis which confined her to a wheelchair and caused her more or less constant pain. Yet she managed to remain cheerful, witty, and well-dressed, and even to go on with her hobby of embroidering needlework pictures.<br>
<br>Jessie Vaizey wrote principally for and about women, but it was the handful of her books for girls which brought her lasting popularity. Her first success in this field was <span class="italic">About Peggy Savile</span> (1900), but her resounding triumph was <span class="italic">Pixie O'Shaughnessy</span> (1902). This heroine was not the first wild Irish girl in school-story fiction, but her na&iuml;vety, charm, and thoughtfulness made her particularly bewitching, and the book was to be reprinted as late as 1940. <span class="italic">Pixie</span>'s Irish background was derived from a brief holiday visit, just as Egypt had supplied the setting for <span class="italic">A Rose-Coloured Thread</span> (1898), Liverpool for several books, Hertfordshire for <span class="italic">A Houseful of Girls</span> (1901), and London flats for others.<br>
<br>In 1910 the Vaizeys moved to The Pryors, a large block of flats overlooking Hampstead Heath, where the outlook gave Jessie much pleasure. Jessie Vaizey died on 23 January 1917, following an operation for an appendix abscess, having been sustained in all the troubles of her life by her strong Presbyterian faith. She had been much distressed by the outbreak of the First World War, although she did not allow it to shadow her writing. Jessie Vaizey preferred to give her stories happy endings, but they were not always conventional ones and she was well aware of the sadder side of life. Her most interesting books lay bare two of the dilemmas then facing middle-class young women: the lack of meaningful occupation for the well-to-do (for instance in <span class="italic">Grizel Married</span>, 1915) and the scarcity of gainful employment for the poverty-stricken (as in <span class="italic">The Daughters of a Genius</span>, 1903, and particularly <span class="italic">The Independence of Claire</span>, 1915). This perception, and her careful delineations of middle-class society, memorably distinguish her work from the mass of merely romantic contemporary fiction.<br>
