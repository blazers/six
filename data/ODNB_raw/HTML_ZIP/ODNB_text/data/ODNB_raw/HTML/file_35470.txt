<span class="headword">Peppiatt, Sir  Leslie Ernest</span>  (1891&#150;1968), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 7 November 1891 at West Hackney, London, the eldest son of William Robert Peppiatt, a railway clerk, and his wife, Emily Elizabeth Giles. He was educated, along with his two brothers, at Bancroft's School, Woodford, Essex. Emily Peppiatt was ambitious for her sons, but her husband's early death left the family struggling financially and Peppiatt left school at sixteen and took employment in a solicitors' office. He was, however, able to secure articles and, on his admission to the profession in July 1913, joined the firm of Ince, Colt, Ince, and Roscoe. On the outbreak of the First World War, Peppiatt joined the 7th London regiment, serving with distinction until 1918; he reached the rank of major, was twice mentioned in dispatches, and was awarded the MC and bar. Of his two brothers, both on active service, Kenneth Oswald Peppiatt (1893&#150;1983), who was awarded the MC and bar, rejoined the Bank of England, where he had been a junior clerk before the war, in 1918, but the younger brother, Will, was killed.<br>
<br>Peppiatt returned to Ince, Colt, Ince, and Roscoe and in 1921 joined the British American Tobacco Company (BAT) as a legal adviser. On 16 June 1927 he married Cicely Mallyn, daughter of George Edward Howse, a director of the travel firm Thomas Cook. The Peppiatts bought a small house in Beaconsfield, moving later to a larger one they had built also in Beaconsfield. There were two sons of the marriage, Hugh and Martin. Both were educated, like their cousins (Kenneth's sons), who were of a similar age, at Winchester College; Martin became a clergyman and Hugh, after Oxford, joined Freshfields and became a City lawyer.<br>
<br>Peppiatt's work for BAT involved a great deal of travel and lengthy periods away from home, and in 1935 he accepted an invitation to become a partner with a City firm of solicitors, Freshfields. No doubt his brother Kenneth, who had risen rapidly in the Bank of England hierarchy, becoming in 1934 chief cashier, (and being knighted in 1941), effected the introduction.<br>
<br>Since early in the eighteenth century the firm, known in 1935 as Freshfields, Leese, and Munns&#151;it became Freshfields in 1945&#151;had held the appointment as solicitors to the Bank of England; it had other distinguished corporate clients as well as a large private client practice. Two years after Peppiatt joined Freshfields, the firm's senior partner, Sir William Leese, died suddenly. Peppiatt took over his role in managing the Bank of England's work, and although he did not become senior partner until 1953, he was increasingly in control of the firm during the war and immediately afterwards. These were difficult times, particularly when the firm's offices in Old Jewry were completely destroyed by bombing in 1944. In the immediate post-war years the firm was smaller than its competitors such as Slaughter and May and Linklaters and Paines, while its image as solicitors to the establishment could sometimes discourage new clients as much as attract them.<br>
<br>As senior partner of Freshfields from 1953 to 1962, Peppiatt inaugurated a period of growth in the firm, necessary if it was to keep pace with the competition from other leading City law firms. The firm's connection with the Bank of England had always brought it other clients but had also led the firm sometimes to decline what it saw as unsuitable business. Peppiatt sought to redefine what might be seen as unsuitable in changing times as well as to extend the firm's financial and commercial practice at a time when the City's international financial business was expanding rapidly. A shrewd solicitor, he noted the growing importance of American investment in the sterling area and developed useful connections for the firm in the USA. At the same time he zealously protected the firm's connection with the bank and its reputation in the City. He represented the Bank's interests in the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of the 1950s, the bank rate tribunal chaired by Sir Hubert Parker, charged with investigating whether information about a coming change in bank rate had been leaked.<br>
<br>Senior partners of City law firms were traditionally autocrats, but not all were, as Peppiatt was, also benevolent and charming. The strict formality within the office began to be relaxed in his time. Peppiatt's interest in people, combined with his personal belief that solicitors ought to play a part in public life, were both evidenced in his activities outside the firm. He served on a number of committees, including the Spens committee on the remuneration of medical specialists and dental practitioners in 1947 and the disciplinary committee of the Architects' Registration Council from 1949 to 1955. He chaired the departmental committee on betting on horse-racing in 1960. He helped to manage several charities, including the George VI Memorial Fund, the 1930 Fund for the Benefit of Trained District Nurses, the Solicitors' Benevolent Fund, and the Lord Mayor of London's Appeal Fund.<br>
<br>With his busy practice and public life Peppiatt had little time for his favourite leisure pursuit of fishing. Moreover he was from 1940 a member of the council of the Law Society, and president of the society in 1958&#150;9. He was awarded the then customary knighthood in 1959. Peppiatt retired in 1962 and died on 15 November 1968 at his home, Cleve Cottage, Wisborough Green, Sussex, survived by his wife. Building on the post-war foundations he had laid, Freshfields continued to grow, not least when his son Hugh was senior partner (1982&#150;90), becoming one of London's leading international law firms.<br>
