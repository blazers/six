<span class="headword">Biggs,  (Felicity) Jane  Ewart-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Felicity Jane Randall]</span>, Baroness Ewart-Biggs  (1929&#150;1992), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in India on 22 August 1929, the second child and only daughter of Basil FitzHerbert Randall, a major in the Indian army, and his wife, Rena. After her father died when she was only a few months old, her mother returned to England with her two children. Jane was sent as a border to Downe House School near Newbury and later attended secretarial college. She worked as a secretary at the Foreign Office before joining the Savoy Hotel. On 5 May 1960 she married Christopher Thomas Ewart Ewart-Biggs (1921&#150;1976), a diplomatist; they had one son and two daughters. Marriage opened a new life to Jane Ewart-Biggs, and at successive postings in Algiers, London, Brussels, and Paris she happily combined the responsibilities of a mother with the duties of a diplomatist's wife&#151;a life that she described in her memoir <span class="italic">Pay, Pack and Follow</span> (1984).<br>
<br>This existence came to an abrupt end on 21 July 1976 when Christopher Ewart-Biggs, the newly appointed British ambassador to Ireland, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, his car blown up by a landmine outside Dublin. Jane Ewart-Biggs learned of his death over her car radio while she was driving in London. After the memorial service in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, she found sufficient self-control to deliver a special broadcast on Irish television, in which she declared: &#145;I feel no bitterness, there is no hatred in my heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Oct 1992). Her message was &#145;a beacon at a dark time for Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Oct 1992), and she subsequently became involved in the non-sectarian peace movement founded by Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams. She also launched a memorial fund in her husband's name which established the Christopher Ewart-Biggs literary prize, to recognize work that encouraged a greater understanding between the British and Irish peoples.<br>
<br>Involvement in causes that her husband held dear, and in particular that of European integration, was one of the ways in which Jane Ewart-Biggs outwardly came to terms with his death. At a deeper level she struggled with a sense of &#145;desperate injustice, despair, loss and waste&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 14 Sept 1988). She found an antidote in work and joined the Labour Party, a step that surprised some friends but which reflected a long-held commitment to socialism. Her hopes of selection as a candidate first for the European parliament and then the Greater London council were frustrated by selection committees wary of her background. But her energy, determination, and charisma made her an undoubted asset to the party, and in 1981 she was created a life peer. Tall and elegant, with striking good looks, Jane Ewart-Biggs was for some the epitome of &#145;radical chic&#146;. In the House of Lords she impressed fellow peers as &#145;the only person here with a waist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 9 Oct 1992). But media attention on her image obscured the seriousness with which she approached her new role. She was always meticulously prepared, and she became an effective speaker without ever being a natural orator. Her ability and industry were recognized when in 1983 she was appointed Labour front-bench spokesman on home affairs. In 1987 she was given responsibility for consumer affairs and overseas development as well, and in 1988 she became an opposition whip.<br>
<br>Jane Ewart-Biggs was strongly critical of the social policies of the Thatcher governments and defended the &#145;new poor&#146;&#151;single parents, the unemployed, and the elderly. She identified with &#145;alternative Britain&#146; and was involved in prison reform, the Charter 88 movement, and the National Council for One-Parent Families. As a feminist she advocated the creation of a ministry for women. Her concern about world poverty and its effect on children led to her appointment in 1984 as the president of the British committee of UNICEF. She was especially proud of this connection and travelled widely to further UNICEF's work, making two visits to the drought-stricken regions of Sudan. With all of these competing claims she never lost sight of the cause that was her introduction to public life. She was a member of Lord Kilbrandon's all-party commission of inquiry on Northern Ireland in 1984 and supported its recommendation of an increased role for the Dublin government in the province. She also favoured the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985 and opposed the reintroduction of internment. But she felt a lasting repugnance towards some of those involved in politics in Northern Ireland, and on one occasion she declined to share the platform at an Oxford Union debate with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
<br>In 1991 Jane Ewart-Biggs was diagnosed with cancer, and her last appearances in the House of Lords, in 1992, were in a wheelchair. On 18 September 1992, three weeks before her death, she married her partner of fourteen years, Kevin Patrick O'Sullivan, a consulting engineer. The ceremony took place in the Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, where she died on 8 October 1992.<br>
