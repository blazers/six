<span class="headword">Pack,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1700&#150;1724), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, had a light voice, bordering on the contralto. According to William Chetwood he pleased audiences by taking the female part in sung dialogues with Richard Leveridge. Nothing is known of his birth or upbringing, but he made his acting d&eacute;but as Westmoreland in Betterton's revival of <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 9 January 1700. He made regular appearances in that theatre from 1700 to October 1705, always in supporting roles such as Roderigo in <span class="italic">Othello</span>. He was probably at his best in playing social misfits, losers, and eccentrics, and managers tried to provide him with songs when the text allowed it. As Ogle in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Beau's Duel</span> on 21 October 1702, for example, he was applauded for his whimsical song. It was Centlivre's later play <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span> that provided Pack, as Marplot, with his most famous original part. That was at Drury Lane on 12 May 1709, at a time when London's actors were still in search of a settled theatrical home.<br>
<br>Pack had already learned something of the perils of his craft when, in 1701&#150;2, he was one of the group of actors brought to trial for &#145;using indecent expressions in some late plays&#146; in the wake of Collier's <span class="italic">Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage</span> (1698). The actors were acquitted, and Pack was part of the company that struggled with the acoustics of the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket from 1705 to 1707 before settling at Drury Lane in 1708. He remained at Drury Lane until the end of 1714, relishing in particular the chance to play the title role in <span class="italic">Marplot</span> (30 December 1710), Centlivre's opportunistic sequel to <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>. The lightness of his voice served him in occasional transvestite roles, and these became more frequent after his move to John Rich's company at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1715. Pack's singing was useful to Rich, who rated high art below entertainment, and Pack remained at Lincoln's Inn Fields for the rest of his active theatrical life, singing between the acts when he was unable to sing during them, and often enough wearing women's dress when doing so.<br>
<br>When the playhouses closed Pack entertained at London's summer fairs. In 1717 he and Pinkethman operated a booth at Southwark fair, and in the summer of 1718 he performed at Pinkethman's playhouse in Richmond, where he sang one of his best-loved songs, &#145;London is a Fine Town&#146;. That autumn he was again at Southwark fair, and in 1720 he operated a booth in Hounslow. On 10 March 1722 he announced his farewell performance at Lincoln's Inn Fields. The part he chose was Marplot, and a portrait sign of Pack in that role hung outside the tavern he opened in August 1722. According to Chetwood the tavern was called The Globe and situated near Charing Cross, but the likelier alternative is that it was called the Busy Body and situated at the corner of Haymarket and Pall Mall. It may be that his business did not flourish. Certainly he returned to Lincoln's Inn Fields in the spring of 1724 to play in his own benefit performance and in that of Mrs Knight. Nothing is known of his later career, but he had evidently been dead for some time by 1749, when Chetwood published his <span class="italic">General History</span>. According to Chetwood, Pack was unmarried, but an otherwise unknown Mrs Pack was awarded a benefit at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 28 May 1719; she may have been his wife.<br>
