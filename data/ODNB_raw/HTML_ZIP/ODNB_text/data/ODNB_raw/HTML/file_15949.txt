<span class="headword">Lamont,  David</span>  (1753&#150;1837), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 20 April 1753, the son of John Lamont (1700&#150;1776), minister of Kelton, Kirkcudbrightshire, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1795), daughter of John Affleck of Whitepark. His grandfather John Lamont of Newton in Fife was descended from Allan Lamont, second minister of Scoonie, Fife, after the Reformation. He was licensed by the presbytery of Kirkcudbright in May 1772 and ordained as minister for the parish of Kirkpatrick-Durham in that county in August 1774. He was made DD by the University of Edinburgh in 1780 and was appointed chaplain to the prince of Wales in 1785. On 24 July 1799 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of David Anderson, an excise officer; they had one son, John (1805&#150;1873), an advocate, afterwards a brewer in London. In 1822 Lamont became moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland and chaplain in ordinary for Scotland two years later. As moderator of the general assembly he read an address to George IV and preached before him in St Giles's, Edinburgh, during his visit to Scotland.<br>
<br>A liberal in politics and theology Lamont held a prominent place among the moderate clergy who dominated the Church of Scotland at the time. Contemporaries described him as a popular preacher, an able debater in church courts, and an eloquent platform speaker. A considerable landowner, he divided his property into small holdings, promoted local manufactories, formed benevolent societies among his tenants and parishioners, and was said to have &#145;gained the affection and esteem of all who witnessed his generous and enlightened exertions&#146;. Between 1780 and 1797 he published six works, including <span class="italic">Sermons on Important Subjects</span> (1780&#150;97) and <span class="italic">Subscription of the Confession of Faith of the Church of Scotland</span> (1790). He also contributed an &#145;Account of the parish of Kirkpatrick-Durham&#146; to Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1791&#150;9). He died on 7 January 1837.<br>
