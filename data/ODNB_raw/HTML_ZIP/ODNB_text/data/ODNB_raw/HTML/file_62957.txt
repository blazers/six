<span class="headword">Parker,  (James) Stewart</span>  (1941&#150;1988), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, was born on 20 October 1941 at 86 Larkfield Road, Sydenham, Belfast, the son of George Herbert Parker (1912&#150;1996), tailor's cutter, and Isobella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lynas (1913&#150;1987), who had been a bookbinder before her marriage. His parents were both Northern Ireland protestants. Stewart Parker was educated at Strand primary school, Ashfield Boys' School&#151;where he was taught by a charismatic schoolmaster, John Malone&#151;and Sullivan Upper School. From 1959 until 1964 he studied English literature at Queen's University, Belfast, first with Professor Peter Butter and then with Philip Hobsbaum. He graduated BA with upper second-class honours in English literature in 1963, and MA in 1966 with a dissertation on non-realistic elements in the plays of W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and E. E. Cummings; his external examiner was Professor Peter Ure.<br>
<br>Parker's studies at Queen's University were impeded by the onset of cancer, apparently initiated by a kick on the kneecap while playing football. He spent most of a year in hospital, during which he suffered the amputation of his left leg. Previous to this, he had been keen on amateur theatricals. With his sturdy build, cherubic countenance, and rich baritone voice, he might well have made his way as a performer. The voice, at least, never left him; he was always a notable reader of his own&#151;and other people's&#151;work.<br>
<br>Parker early on gained a local reputation as a poet and was a key figure in the Belfast group, a creative writing workshop whose prominent members in the early 1960s included Seamus Heaney and James Simmons and, later, Michael Longley. Parker's contributions to the works that were discussed week by week included several chapters of a novel, <span class="italic">The Tribulations of S. T. Toile</span>. This, published only in part during Parker's lifetime, is to be brought out by Blackstaff Press, Belfast. The novel is a work of black humour, involving a school where everybody is malformed, neurotic, spiteful, or otherwise deranged. Poems on similar themes, notably &#145;Crutch&#146; (an excerpt from <span class="italic">S. T. Toile</span>) and &#145;Coming Out&#146; (from hospital), appeared in <span class="italic">Young Commonwealth Poets '65</span>, edited by P. L. Brent. &#145;Paddy Dies&#146; and &#145;Health&#146; appeared in <span class="italic">British Poetry since 1945</span> (1970), edited by Edward Lucie-Smith. A long poem, <span class="italic">The Casualty's Meditation</span>, was published in 1970 as a pamphlet in a much sought-after series, <span class="roman">Belfast: Festival Publications</span>. There are probably sufficient pieces of Parker's verse to make up a creditable collection.<br>
<br>Parker's main interest, however, was to lie in drama. On 26 August 1964 he had married a student teacher, Kathleen (Kate) Ireland, and in that year went with her to Clinton, New York. Here he became an instructor in English and creative writing at Hamilton College. Always a collector of strange names, Parker was delighted to find that among his colleagues were Gerald Commissar, Homer Snavely, and Channing Richardson Bullfinch III. After several unsuccessful attempts to gain academic posts back in the United Kingdom, Parker moved in 1967 to Cornell University. He seems, however, to have found that teaching impeded his creative effort, so in 1969 he returned to Belfast, determined to earn his living as a writer. He arrived in Northern Ireland the same week as the British army. This circumstance, together with his exile abroad, seems to have sharpened his sense of things Irish, and he involved himself in studying Irish language and culture. His early concern with his maimed body gradually broadened into dramatizing the pains of Ireland itself.<br>
<br>Parker began a regular pop music review column in the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> and contributed articles on literary and theatrical subjects to that and to several other newspapers and journals. His main source of income at this juncture seems to have been BBC radio. <span class="italic">The Iceberg</span>, a play about the <i>Titanic</i>, was broadcast on 7 January 1975, and one about a Belfast showband musician, <span class="italic">I'm a Dreamer, Montreal</span>, on 20 July 1977. A televised version of the latter was transmitted by Thames on 6 March 1979 and was awarded that year's Christopher Ewart-Biggs memorial prize. Other plays pioneered on radio included the wonderfully titled <span class="italic">The Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner</span> (1979), which won the Giles Cooper award for 1980, and <span class="italic">The Traveller</span> (1985), about the existential crisis of a travel writer. The first of these was transmitted as a television play by the BBC in 1981.<br>
<br>Parker had already had a play about a Belfast song-writing team, <span class="italic">Catchpenny Twist</span>, first staged at the Peacock Theatre, Dublin, in 1977, adapted in the same year for BBC television in the <span class="roman">Play for Today</span> series. This was based on the true story of a couple of Queen's University students who wrote a Eurovision song contest entry for their idol, the then famous singer Sandie Shaw. It included a song, &#145;Ziggy-Zaggy&#146;, performed not by the protagonist but by the comedian Peter Kelly, that might well have won the contest in reality as an entry in its own right. It is the case of a parody persuasive enough to be capable of literal acceptance.<br>
<br>However, Parker's main ambition was for success on the stage. He served for a time as resident playwright at the King's Head Theatre, Islington. Here an Irish-Caribbean musical entitled <span class="italic">Kingdom Come</span>, written in collaboration with the composer Shaun Davey, was first performed on 17 January 1978. A stage play about a Belfast bicycle salesman had already been produced at the Dublin theatre festival in October 1975, where it was an unexpected and runaway success. This had been revived at the King's Head in 1976, and when it won Parker the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> most promising playwright award, it was transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre in London's West End in February 1977. <span class="italic">Spokesong</span> also opened at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, on 9 February 1978. This production was brought to the Circle in the Square Theatre on Broadway on 15 March 1979. It represented Parker's breakthrough as a writer.<br>
<br>In 1982 Parker, who had separated from his wife, moved to London, where he was to spend what were to be his few remaining years with a fellow playwright, Lesley Bruce, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnett (<i>b</i>. 1944). By now, his impact was mainly through television. <span class="italic">Iris in the Traffic, Ruby in the Rain</span> (1981) shows two women whose paths intersect during a drizzly day in Belfast. Each pursues her own path and they meet only at the end when Ruby, a Catholic psychologist, discovers that the distressed old lady she has picked up in her car is mother of the protestant clerk, Iris.<br>
<br>The influence of Joyce's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, with its two wandering protagonists, is manifest here. It is no coincidence that this television play was followed in 1982 by another: <span class="italic">Joyce in June</span>, commissioned for the Joyce centenary. In addition, <span class="italic">Blue Money</span>, about a taxi driver who absconds with a briefcase full of cash belonging to a customer, was screened in 1984, and <span class="italic">Radio Pictures</span> in 1985. This latter, written for and produced on television, shows a radio play, &#145;Mr Deadman and Miss Goodbody&#146;, being rehearsed. During rehearsals the actors and production staff interact and react, their conflicts acting as a commentary on the radio play and vice versa. The whole constitutes an ingenious discourse on the nature of imagination. Here, as elsewhere, Parker owed a good deal to his producer and actors&#151;in this case, Nicholas Renton, Frances Tomelty, and Dinsdale Landen, among others. However, it is equally true that Parker had given them a wealth of material with which to work.<br>
<br>Stewart Parker had become a famous name in television and was entrusted with the script of a series. <span class="italic">Lost Belongings</span>, directed by Nicholas Bicat, was screened in six hour-long episodes starting in April 1987. This had been twenty years in gestation: an early draft had been entered in the Irish Life Drama competition for 1967. It is a recension of the Deirdre myth, in which a child fostered by the king of Ulster as a prospective bride runs off instead with a young minstrel. The whole story has been updated to contemporary Belfast; however, the outcome is basically the same. Deirdre eventually returns to Ulster but, as had been foretold in the legend, brings disaster upon the place, and dies ignominiously.<br>
<br>The summit of Parker's achievement may be three stage plays produced, respectively, in Belfast (1984), Birmingham (1986), and Derry (1987), and published under the collective title <span class="italic">Three Plays for Ireland</span> (1989). The first of these, <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, is an account of the late eighteenth-century protestant reformer Henry Joy McCracken. This politician had been instrumental in founding the United Irishmen, a movement involving protestants and Catholics alike, whose common goal was to free Ireland from British rule. The consequent uprising culminated in the unsuccessful siege of Antrim in 1798, after which McCracken was tried and executed. Parker seems to have identified with McCracken's politics. The play has a framework of dialogue between McCracken and his mistress, which is interspersed by seven scenes in the form of flashbacks, each taking over the style of a major Irish playwright: George Farquhar, Dion Boucicault, Oscar Wilde, G. B. Shaw, J. M. Synge, Sean O'Casey, and Brendan Behan. Parker may well have seen these as his mentors.<br>
<br>The second play in this presumed trilogy, <span class="italic">Heavenly Bodies</span>, deals with the life of one of these same playwrights, the nineteenth-century Irish-American Dion Boucicault. The cast consists of two main performers, one of them playing Boucicault and the other an interlocutor, with a group of students acting out multifarious minor roles. The play is really a series of sketches presenting Boucicault as an indomitable Irishman, a kind of Faust-figure. As with all Parker's plays, music is very important&#151;not as mere decoration, but as an integral part of the action.<br>
<br>One of the characters in the third play, <span class="italic">Pentecost</span>, plays the trombone; another toys with the banjo; there are distant Lambeg drums; and a strategically placed hymn. The action evokes the squalid events of 1974, when a protracted strike organized by protestant extremists brought Belfast to a standstill. Trapped in a semi-derelict house are two Catholics, two protestants, and a ghost&#151;also a protestant&#151;whose age exactly spans the troubled century. The interpolations of Lily, the ghost who in life gave away an illegitimate child fathered by an Englishman, enable Parker to rise to heights of rhetoric. Here she is raging at the Catholic mother whose child has died:<blockquote>I haven't noticed you bringing up any youngsters. What right does a hussy like you have to question God's will? Why would he bless the fruit of your womb more than of mine, look at this place, you have it like a pigsty &hellip; are there not enough runty litters running the streets, whelped by your kind, reared with a half-brick in their fists, and the backsides hanging out of their trousers?</blockquote>The play is replete with images of sterility but also with implications of human forgiveness. Pentecost is a season when even ordinary people prophesy. The derelict house&#151;which, after all, has belonged to the ghost&#151;represents an Ireland in which these competing tribes have to co-exist. A central figure Marian, the bereaved mother, says &#145;I want this house to live. We have committed sacrilege enough on life, in this place, in these times.&#146;<br>
<br>After writing this last play&#151;his own masterpiece and a major work of Irish drama&#151;Stewart Parker again contracted cancer, this time in the stomach. He died, at the height of his powers, on 2 November 1988 in the Westminster Hospital, aged forty-seven. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes scattered into the Irish Sea. At his funeral, Parker's colleagues in the making of a new Irish literature&#151;among them Seamus Heaney, Michael and Edna Longley, Derek Mahon&#151;paid their respects to the passing of this latest in a line of Irish playwrights, playwrights whom he had loved and from whom he had sought to learn. A two-volume edition of his complete plays was published in 1999.<br>
