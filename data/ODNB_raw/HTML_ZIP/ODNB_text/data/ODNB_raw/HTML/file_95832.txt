<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blatch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Triggs]</span>,  Emily May</span>, Baroness Blatch  (1937&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 July 1937 at the Maternity Hospital, Birkenhead, Cheshire, the only daughter of Stephen Joseph Triggs, a butcher's shop assistant and later electrician, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carpenter. She was educated at Prenton secondary school for girls in Birkenhead and at Huntingdonshire College. At the age of eighteen she joined the Women's Royal Air Force and became an air traffic assistant. In 1959 she left the WRAF and went to work in the civilian branch of air traffic control, at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down. There she met and, on 7 September 1963, married John Richard Blatch, RAF officer and test pilot; they lived first in Wiltshire and then at Spaldwick (which until 1974 was in Huntingdonshire and thereafter in Cambridgeshire). They had four children.<br>
<br>Blatch's political career did not start until 1977, when she was asked by the Conservatives to stand for Cambridgeshire county council and won, assisted by the unpopularity of the Labour government, in what was seen as a natural Labour seat, with many London &#145;overspill&#146; electors. Crucially her forcefulness and ability had won her the support of the leader of the Cambridgeshire Conservatives, Robert James. In 1981 he promoted her move to the leadership of the county council. She ran a tight and effective ship in Cambridgeshire during the next four years. The county council was singled out as an example of good government by the Audit Commission when it reduced costs by 25 per cent and was chosen to take a lead in introducing local financial management for schools because of its reputation for getting things done. She was appointed CBE in 1983 and remained a councillor until 1989, but stood down as council leader in 1985 when the Conservatives lost political control.<br>
<br>In 1987 Blatch was elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Blatch, of Hinchingbrooke, Cambridgeshire, by Margaret Thatcher, who had been impressed by Blatch's leadership in Cambridgeshire. She was reportedly astounded by her elevation, and at first wondered if she was the victim of a practical joke. She made her maiden speech in a debate on primary and secondary education. There she set out what were later to be her watchwords as education minister&#151;that the fundamental objectives of Conservative policy were:<blockquote>The raising of standards; the retention of diversity and choice and the strengthening of the accountability of schools to parents; the recognition of good professional performance by teachers and more importantly, promotion of their standing within the community, and a more stable environment free from industrial strife, within which our children can enjoy a rich and full education. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 488.1048, 15 July 1987)</blockquote>Blatch served as a government whip from January 1990, but it was with the arrival of her friend John Major as prime minister in November 1990 that her career took off. In 1976 she got to know John Major soon after he was selected as parliamentary candidate for Huntingdonshire, and the two families became very close. Politically they, Gillian Shepherd, and other political neighbours became known as the East Anglia (or fenland) mafia. Major appointed her, in November 1990, parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of the Environment, where she took responsibility for heritage issues and piloted the <span class="roman">Local Government Bill</span> through the Lords. In 1991 she was promoted to minister of state at the Department of the Environment, in which post in February 1992 she had the unusual duty of announcing to their lordships' cheers that the department's unloved modern building at 2 Marsham Street (known from its appearance as &#145;the toast rack&#146;) was to be demolished.<br>
<br>In April 1992 the newly re-elected John Major appointed Blatch minister of state for education, and it was in this post that she had her most tumultuous political experience. The Conservative election manifesto had promised a bright future for grant-maintained schools. The secretary of state chosen to deliver the policy was John Patten, a former Oxford don, in his first cabinet appointment. The task was made more difficult because an entirely new administrative and financial structure was needed to manage the transfer of schools from local authority control to grant-maintained status. The education establishment, which ministers failed to cultivate, opposed such schools. This opposition, and the impression that there was no policy to look after the interests of an opted-out school where things might go wrong, meant that the ballots of parents to approve the transfer of a school often failed or did not take place, and the policy stalled. The issue of testing was another minefield: the National Association of Schoolmasters / Union of Women Teachers successfully defended a legal challenge to its right to take industrial action on the testing arrangements and the government then announced a review of the curriculum and testing to be carried out by Sir Ron Dearing. Patten's health broke down under the strain of these events and he was absent from the department until the autumn of 1993. Blatch carried on the struggle for grant-maintained status in the Lords debates, and on Patten's disappearance to recuperate she took over as acting secretary of state; in this capacity she accepted the compromises in the Dearing review. In July 1994 she was moved to become minister of state at the Home Office, her last ministerial appointment, where she largely avoided the controversies surrounding the secretary of state, Michael Howard.<br>
<br>In opposition from the election of the Blair government in May 1997, Blatch was successively Conservative spokesman on home affairs (1997&#150;8) and education (1998) in the House of Lords, and finally deputy opposition leader in the Lords until her death. In her last years in politics she supported Baroness Young (Janet Young) in her campaigns on sex education. She also had the ironic pleasure of watching the Labour government travelling the same agonizing road to freeing schools from local authority control through the construction of separately funded academies. Her commitment and willingness to fight for her convictions shone through her political speeches in this as in earlier periods, and she proved to be an authentic voice for middle Britain at the highest level. She died of complications induced by pancreatic cancer at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 31 May 2005, and was survived by her husband, John, two sons, and a daughter, one son having predeceased her.<br>
