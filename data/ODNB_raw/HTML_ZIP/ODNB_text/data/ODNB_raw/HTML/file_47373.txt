<span class="headword">Macdonald <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>McDonald]</span>,  Alexander</span>  (1821&#150;1881), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 27 June 1821 at Dalmacoulter Farm, New Monkland, Lanarkshire, the eldest of seven children of Daniel McDonald and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watt. His father was a former seaman in the Royal Navy, who was employed as an agricultural labourer at the time of Alexander's birth, and subsequently worked as a coal and ironstone miner. The spelling of the family name was traditionally McDonald; Alexander adopted the Macdonald form in the 1870s. The family moved around the Lanarkshire coalfield before settling at Wattston near Airdrie in 1840. Although Macdonald was a regular church attender in his early years and a pupil at the parish school, his religious faith seems to have faded in later life, and it would appear that he had no particular religious affiliation by the time of his death. Macdonald never married but he always maintained close and cordial relations with his extended family.<br>
<br>After a brief spell at New Monkland parish school, from the age of nine in 1830 until 1846 Macdonald worked as a coal and ironstone miner. Although a hard-working and successful miner, working on occasion as an oversman, the lowest rung of the mining managerial ladder of the time, he also seems to have been active in attempts to organize the miners into trade unions, and suffered some victimization from employers as a consequence. He took one of the few routes out of the pit by extending his meagre education using his earnings to finance evening-class studies in Greek and Latin. This eventually allowed him to attend Glasgow University full-time between 1846 and 1849. Attending university in the winter, he worked as a miner in the summer months to fund his education. Macdonald did not take a degree, but his certificates of attendance allowed him to follow a career as a teacher. Life at university left its mark, and in later years when he had sufficient wealth he was able to bequeath &pound;1000 to Glasgow University to provide two annual bursaries for young miners keen to pursue full-time studies at that institution.<br>
<br>From 1850 to 1855 Macdonald made a living as a teacher and private tutor in Airdrie. His ability to engage easily with social groups outside the labouring classes was to become a key factor in his success as an advocate of organized labour, but it also brought accusations of social snobbery, and even betrayal, by some contemporaries and later commentators. Macdonald's involvement in colliery enterprises, which grew out of contacts he acquired at university and as a private tutor, always added to the suspicion that his commitment to organized labour was compromised by his status as an owner of capital. It was, however, the small fortune he accumulated from speculative investment in the mining industry which allowed him the time and security to engage in labour activism. An effective and engaging public speaker, he could be rather censorious about the perceived weaknesses of the working men he led, but he was also hostile to middle- or upper-class paternalism.<br>
<br>Macdonald was among the first trade union leaders to achieve national standing, but he saw himself as an agent and advocate of labour working within, rather than challenging, the economic order. His rise to national prominence began in October 1855 when he created a unified Scottish coal and ironstone miners' union. While this union was little more than a co-ordinating body, with Macdonald as its sole paid official, it did try to convert the older traditions of Scottish mining unionism, which sought restriction of output and control over the entry of workers into mining, into a more formal regulatory relationship with the employers. It also established Macdonald's belief in lobbying parliament as a means of redressing the grievances of working men, especially in relation to long-standing abuses such as the truck system or raising the minimum working age. It was an outlook reinforced by a dispute which engulfed the coal industry in Scotland in 1856. Against Macdonald's advice, the Scottish miners came out on strike in the spring of 1856 seeking to reverse wage cuts imposed by the owners. By the early summer the strike and the newly formed union had collapsed.<br>
<br>Macdonald's belief in negotiation and lobbying was to bring him into frequent conflict with union activists who sought a more confrontational strategy. It was a conflict of perspective and outlook which was to be exposed most starkly with the establishment of the Miners' National Association in 1863. This was the culmination of earlier attempts by Macdonald to create a union linking all the British coalfields. In 1858 an informal co-ordinating body headed by Macdonald had been established; this he used as a platform to lobby parliament and government ministers. It paid off in the enactment in 1860 of the <span class="roman">Mines Act</span>, which included the vital provision for the election by miners of a checkweighman at each pit to ensure fair payment of wages. The creation of this post was to give a great fillip to union organization in the coalfields. Despite Macdonald's success, there was often a feeling that the interests of the mine workers were being sacrificed by leaders who were too close to the owners in terms of mentality and lifestyle. In 1864 this debate over strategy resulted in a short-lived schism in the miners' ranks. Led by the radical journalist John Towers, and the former Chartist lawyer W. P. Roberts, critics of Macdonald withdrew from the National Association and established the Practical Miners' Association which tried to pursue a more aggressive industrial policy. This breakaway organization collapsed within two years, but there remained an undercurrent of suspicion and hostility to the leadership of Macdonald. His well-known friendship with the wealthy Scottish tory coal owner Lord Elcho did little to allay such misgivings. Yet despite this opposition, he does seem to have retained the confidence of ordinary members of his association, and was the recipient of a number of collections and donations subscribed by them.<br>
<br>Macdonald was elected to the first parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress in 1871, and he served as chairman of the committee in 1872 and 1873. He lobbied the Liberal government over changes relating to trade union activities in the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span> of 1871, and the <span class="roman">Mines Regulation Act</span> of 1872. In addition Macdonald accepted a place on the royal commission on trade unions which reported in 1875. However, he issued a dissenting statement, arguing for more extensive reforms of labour laws than the majority report had advocated.<br>
<br>From 1869 Thomas Halliday and his Amalgamated Association of Miners, which recruited mainly in Lancashire and south Wales, provided another challenge to Macdonald's parliament focused strategy. However, relations between Macdonald and Halliday were never acrimonious and this threat to Macdonald's national supremacy also faded in the later 1870s. His enthusiasm for the parliamentary road to improved conditions culminated in Macdonald's election as MP for Stafford in 1874. As the endorsed candidate of the Labour Representation League, Macdonald is recognized, alongside Thomas Burt, the MP for Morpeth returned at the same election, as one of the first two overtly labour, albeit Liberal/labour, members of parliament. While he took the Liberal whip Macdonald always adopted a fairly independent stance, and made &#145;labour&#146; questions and resolution of the Irish problem the focus of his parliamentary work. Towards the end of his life young activists in the Scottish coalfields, such as James Keir Hardie, again questioned Macdonald's collaborative strategy. Re-elected as MP for Stafford in 1880, he served briefly as a government back-bencher until his death in 1881.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Macdonald purchased a small estate at Wellhall near Hamilton, where he died on 31 October 1881. He was buried in the churchyard at New Monkland on 6 November. While some of his critics, both contemporary and recent, have seen his leadership as flawed, he is rightly regarded as one of the founding fathers of mining trade unionism and labour politics.<br>
