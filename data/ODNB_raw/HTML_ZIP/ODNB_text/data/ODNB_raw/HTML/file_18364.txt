<span class="headword">Maugham,  Robert</span>  (1788&#150;1862), <span class="occ">lawyer and first secretary of the Law Society</span>, was born on 9 March 1788 in Chancery Lane, London, one of four children of William Maugham (<i>bap</i>. 1759). About 1805 he entered the office of George Barrow, attorney of Threadneedle Street, but he did not formally become an articled clerk until March 1812. He was admitted in 1817 and by the early 1820s he was working and living at 17 Great James Street. He married in 1822, and his eldest son, Robert Ormond Maugham (1823&#150;1884), also a solicitor, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34946/', "Frederic Herbert Maugham, first Viscount Maugham (1866&#150;1958)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34947/', "William Somerset Maugham (1874&#150;1965)")</script>.<br>
<br>It is not clear what role Maugham played, if any, in the formation of the Law Institution in 1825 (subsequently the Law Society), but he acted as secretary to the provisional committee in March, and was subsequently appointed secretary to the committee of management on 7 June 1825. In the same year he achieved prominence with the publication of <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of Attornies</span>, an important work of synthesis relating to statutory and case law affecting the profession. In 1832 his position as secretary was confirmed and he was awarded a salary of &pound;400 a year and a set of apartments in the Law Society's hall, Chancery Lane.<br>
<br>Although he combined his role as secretary with private practice, Maugham's major achievement was the supervision of the institution's successful development after its foundation. As the only permanent official of any significance he played a central part in ensuring the institution, later the Incorporated Law Society, had a sound constitutional and financial basis. He guided the society through its transition from a joint-stock concern to a professional association and helped secure the second royal charter in 1845, which remained the principal constitutional document.<br>
<br>Maugham successfully oversaw the expansion of the hall and the establishment of lectures and examinations conducted by the society. He orchestrated the passing of the <span class="roman">Attorneys and Solicitors Act</span> of 1843, which recognized the place of the society in the profession. The act appointed the society as registrar of attorneys and solicitors, thereby making it responsible for the administration of the roll. Maugham remained secretary until his death, during a period of great importance for the society, in which it was guided through the critical early years and established as the pre-eminent national body for the solicitors' profession.<br>
<br>Maugham occupied a significant place in the development of the profession and took a keen interest in many professional issues. He continued to publish works on legal subjects and in 1830 he founded and edited the <span class="italic">Legal Observer</span>, the first legal journal dealing with professional matters, other than the reporting of cases and legislation, to become successfully established. The journal was used to promote the interests of the Incorporated Law Society and the profession, and acted as a voice for the opinions of its editor. Maugham was also a campaigner for improved legal education and higher standards of qualification, believing this would raise the status of the profession. In 1846 he gave evidence before the select committee on legal education. His proposals were far-reaching and those relating to examinations were largely adopted in the <span class="roman">Attorneys and Solicitors Act</span> of 1860.<br>
<br>Very little is known of Maugham's personal life or interests outside the profession. He retired from practice in 1856, when members of the society subscribed &pound;600 as a testimonial, which included a gift of plate. Also in 1856 he relinquished control of the <span class="italic">Legal Observer</span>, when it merged with the <span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal and Reporter</span>. Maugham died on 16 July 1862 at Chancery Lane and was buried on 22 July at Nunhead cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Mary.<br>
