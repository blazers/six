<span class="headword">Devons,  Ely</span>  (1913&#150;1967), <span class="occ">statistician and economist</span>, was born in Bangor, north Wales, on 29 July 1913, the second eldest in a family of three boys and three girls of David Isaac Devons, a Jewish minister from Vilna who had arrived in Britain in 1902 on a Russian passport at the age of twenty-one, and his wife, Edith Edelstein, who was from Ireland and ten years younger than her husband. A younger brother, Samuel, was professor of physics at the University of Manchester in the 1950s when Devons held the chair of applied economics.<br>
<br>Devons attended a number of different schools as his family moved to Stoke-on-Trent, Portsmouth, and then Manchester, ending up at North Manchester Municipal High School before entering the University of Manchester. In the course of a chance encounter in the street he was persuaded by Harold Laski to study economics and graduated in 1934 with first-class honours in the school of economics, politics, and modern history. As Drummond Fraser research fellow he read for the MA degree at Manchester, researching British production statistics and producing his first article, &#145;Output per head in Great Britain, 1924&#150;33&#146; (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>). He married in 1939 Estelle Wine, a concert pianist from Dublin and a pupil of Solomon. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Devons's career as a statistician began in 1935 with a post under Glyn Hughes as economic assistant to the Joint Committee of Cotton Trades Organizations in Manchester. In March 1940 he joined the Central Economic Information Service&#151;a small group of economists and statisticians from which developed at the end of the year both the economic section of the war cabinet secretariat and the Central Statistical Office. Devons quickly made his mark as one of a number of Manchester men, including John Jewkes, D. N. Chester, and Harry Campion, who played a major part in the early days of these bodies. His special responsibility was to assemble the secret statistics accumulating in various parts of Whitehall and issue them in a form convenient for the central direction of policy. In this he was extremely successful and the work he initiated in 1940&#150;41 had a revolutionary effect on the presentation of official statistics. Government statistics never afterwards looked so dull, discontinuous, and inaccessible. It was a job which he repeated in the Ministry of Aircraft Production and again for the Organization for European Economic Co-operation in 1950 when he took a hand in the first issue of its statistical bulletins.<br>
<br>Devons did not steep himself in statistics without considering the lessons they pointed. He had a chance to combine the two when Jewkes, now in charge of aircraft planning, asked him to join him as chief statistician. In the next four years Devons came to exercise an increasingly dominant role in the Ministry of Aircraft Production, taking over from Jewkes as head of planning in 1944. His experience in the planning of aircraft and aircraft components formed the background to much of his later thinking about economic and administrative problems and provided the material for his <span class="italic">Planning in Practice</span> (1950), a classic of its kind.<br>
<br>At the end of the war, after some hesitation, Devons returned to Manchester as reader and later professor of applied economics. He remained there for much of the time as dean of the faculty of economic and social studies, until appointed in 1959 to the chair of commerce at the London School of Economics. Nearly all Devons's published work was composed during his years in Manchester. His <span class="italic">Introduction to British Economic Statistics</span> (1956), a critical guide displaying an unrivalled knowledge of official statistics, was followed by <span class="italic">Essays in Economics</span> (1961). But his main contribution was the stimulus he provided to his distinguished colleagues. The staff seminar which he conducted with Arthur Lewis has been described by Professor Harry Johnson as &#145;the most devastatingly critical forum in the country into which a careless economist could blunder&#146;.<br>
<br>The move to London was not altogether a success since international trade was not Devons's normal field of interest. But as convener of the economics department he was an initiator of structural change, able to think and plan in terms of the institution as a whole. He was largely responsible for the new MSc degrees in economics and econometrics and helped to raise money for graduate fellowships in support of them. In 1965 the title of his chair was changed from commerce to economics. While at the LSE he served from 1959 to 1965 as a member of the Local Government Commission for England and acted as consultant to the British and foreign governments.<br>
<br>A victim of insomnia, Devons was an omnivorous reader and had a particular appetite for government publications, especially minutes of evidence. He declared his leisure activities to be fell-walking, tree-felling, and disputing  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>). He loved debating and was given to paradox and skittishness. This put off many people who failed to notice how right even his more extravagant forecasts proved to be. He was always in command of the relevant facts, never bowed without question to received opinion, and was possessed of an acute and firm judgement rooted in common sense. He hated arrogance, dogmatism, and&#151;most of all&#151;humbug. He had an eye for the weakness of an argument and for the workable solution to a problem. To a rare combination of administrative skill and intellectual power was added an impressive firmness of character which made him incorruptible even in small matters.<br>
<br>Devons's published work seems slight and his career disappointing in relation to his intellectual gifts. This partly reflects his disenchantment with technical economic analysis, partly his preference for administrative tasks, but perhaps most of all a detachment which sprang from lack of ambition. He was not a natural writer or man of action. But he had a capacity for leadership which in the post-war years never found full expression.<br>
<br>Devons had to contend throughout the last twelve years of his life with repeated bouts of illness in the middle of arduous administrative duties. He died, survived by his wife, in St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, on 28 December 1967 after two years of almost continuous ill health.<br>
