<span class="headword">Ford,  (Richard) Boris</span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">educationist and literary editor</span>, was born on 1 July 1917 in Simla, India, son of Brigadier Geoffrey Noel Ford CBE and his Russian wife, Ekatarina. He was first educated as a chorister at King's College School, Cambridge. Music was a lifelong passion: he sang, latterly as counter-tenor, was a good pianist, and built a harpsichord. He attended Gresham's School, Holt, a progressive public school in Norfolk, especially strong in the humanities. Its pupils included W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten, whose work was always close to Ford's heart: his last book, <span class="italic">Benjamin Britten's Poets</span> (1994), was an edition of verse set to music by Britten. His English master at Gresham's, Denys Thompson, sent him to be taught by F. R. Leavis at Downing College, Cambridge, where he took both parts of the English tripos (1938, 1939). While still an undergraduate he published an essay in Leavis's journal <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span>. He was active among the undergraduates in the English Club who were determined, under Leavis's influence, to reform the English curriculum.<br>
<br>Ford was a wartime educator: from the army education corps he moved up to become by 1946 officer commanding the Middle East School of Artistic Studies and then chief editor and director of the Army Bureau of Current Affairs (ABCA). ABCA gave officers and men a critical account of Britain, so critical that Ford attracted the attention of MI5. ABCA pamphlets helped the emergence of the welfare state: Ford believed that the Labour Party came to power in 1945 as a result of the democratizing influence of ABCA seminars. His first book was <span class="italic">Discussion Method</span> (1949).<br>
<br>In 1951 Ford became information officer of the technical assistance board of UNESCO. In 1953 he was invited by W. E. Williams, a former ABCA man, to edit a multi-authored seven-volume <span class="italic">Pelican Guide to English Literature</span> (1954&#150;61; revised, 1982&#150;8). It was a significant initiative in English studies. Ford wrote in the &#145;General introduction&#146; that earlier manuals had &#145;a take-it-or-leave-it attitude about them&#146;, but the <span class="italic">Pelican Guide</span> was intended to be evaluative, concerned &#145;first and foremost, with value for the present&#146;, in the spirit of F. R. Leavis&#151;and perhaps it was created at Leavis's expense. Leavis closed <span class="italic">Scrutiny</span> in 1953, remarking bitterly that Ford had &#145;approached my main people&#146;, and rightly considering that some of the <span class="italic">Pelican Guide</span> essays were derivative. None the less, the overall plan was successful: the <span class="italic">Pelican Guide</span> did provide a &#145;contour-map of the literary scene&#146; with accompanying social history. The first volume, <span class="italic">The Age of Chaucer</span>, was unique to the series because it included a 200-page anthology of non-Chaucerian medieval poetry in original texts which gave early English poetry a presence for contemporary poets.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Pelican Guide</span> period Ford also wrote and administered in the educational field. He was secretary to an inquiry into liberalizing technical education, publishing <span class="italic">Liberal Education in a Technical Age</span> in 1955, when he became editor of <span class="italic">Universities Quarterly</span> (until 1983; later known as <span class="italic">New Universities Quarterly</span>), and also head of schools broadcasting for the television company Associated Rediffusion. His tenure was abbreviated by patrician comments on the quality of the network's advertising output. However, Ford received encouragement from the company for Benjamin Britten's opera for children <span class="italic">Noye's Fludde</span>. In 1957&#150;8 Ford was education secretary at Cambridge University Press, initiating its schools books committee which enabled the press to carry university-level English studies into the school curriculum. He brought David Holbrook and Sybil Marshall to the press. From 1963 to 1965 he was chairman of the National Association for the Teaching of English.<br>
<br>Ford's torrent of post-war proposals and commissions flowed into an academic professional career as educationist, first as professor of education and director of the Institute of Education, then from 1960 to 1963 at Sheffield University, and then from 1963 to 1973 at Sussex University, where, as dean to the school of culture and community studies, with Vice-Chancellor Asa Briggs as ally, he put music on the map in the university. His last chair was at Bristol (1973&#150;82). At a time when teacher training colleges were closing, his <span class="italic">Changing Relationships between Universities and Teachers' Colleges</span> (1975) was timely.<br>
<br>Ford never really retired. He edited for Cambridge University Press the seven-volume <span class="italic">Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain</span> (1988&#150;91), which resembled the <span class="italic">Pelican Guide</span>. He disliked being called an entrepreneur: he was an opportunist with ideas which he nurtured with persistent gentleness, a gentleness that made him a friend to women, though not always to their husbands. He was married twice, first on 7 March 1950 to a schoolteacher, Noreen Edna Auty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Collins (1921/2&#150;1995), the cheery companion of his Yorkshire and Sussex years, with whom he had three children. This marriage was dissolved about 1973, and he married on 21 July 1977 Inge (originally Enid) Inglis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans, a fund-raiser and exhibitions organizer; their marriage was dissolved in 1984. Boris Ford died in the Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, on 19 May 1998.<br>
