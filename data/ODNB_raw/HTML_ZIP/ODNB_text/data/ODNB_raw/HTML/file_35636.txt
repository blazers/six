<span class="headword">Pye, Sir  David Randall</span>  (1886&#150;1960), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and academic administrator</span>, was born on 29 April 1886 in Hampstead, London, the sixth of the seven children of William Arthur Pye, wine merchant, and his wife, Margaret Thompson, daughter of James Burns Kidston, writer to the signet, of Glasgow. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37871/', "Edith Mary Pye")</script> was his sister. A scholar of Tonbridge School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was placed in the first class of the mechanical sciences tripos in 1908; he also won his half blue for rifle shooting. In 1909 C. F. Jenkin, who had just been appointed the first professor of engineering science at Oxford, invited Pye to join him there. He was elected a fellow of New College in 1911.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Pye taught at Winchester College (1915&#150;16), then worked as an experimental officer in the Royal Flying Corps on design and testing, and learned to fly as a pilot. In 1919 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer, and became a fellow of Trinity. There he met Henry Tizard and Harry Ricardo, his association with whom led to important pioneer work on the internal combustion engine. In 1926 Pye married Virginia Frances, daughter of Charles Moore Kennedy, barrister. The couple had two sons and a daughter. She became a well-known writer of books for children under the name of Virginia Pye and was a younger sister of the writer Margaret Kennedy. Pye's outstanding exposition, <span class="italic">The Internal Combustion Engine</span> (2 vols., 1931&#150;4) was published in the <span class="roman">Oxford Engineering Science</span> series, of which he became an editor. In 1925 he was appointed deputy director of scientific research at the Air Ministry under H. E. Wimperis. He succeeded him as director in 1937 and in the same year was appointed CB and elected FRS. During the early war years he became closely associated with the development of the new jet propulsion aircraft engine which he did much to encourage.<br>
<br>In 1943 Pye accepted the provostship of University College, London. He entered upon his new duties with enthusiasm and determination to make a real contribution to the college and to post-war education. Before serious illness caused his resignation in 1951, he had seen the college through an extremely difficult period of rebuilding, following war damage, and of reorganization: probably the greatest achievement of his career. He was knighted in 1952 and in the same year became president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, to which he gave a memorable presidential address on the higher education of engineers, stressing the importance of the artistic or design aspects of engineering.<br>
<br>Pye was fastidious and had the charm of a man of taste and intelligence who preferred to convince others by persuasion rather than by asserting the superiority of his own ideas. Believing in the highest standards, he was never arrogant or certain that he was right. Partly perhaps because he appeared to have no ambitions to leadership he was trusted and followed by his many colleagues in all his working life.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic climber, Pye led the first ascent of the severe Crack of Doom in Skye; in 1922 he was elected to the Alpine Club of which he became vice-president in 1956. He was a friend of G. L. Mallory (whose notice he contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>) and in writing of his loss on Everest, with his companion A. C. Irvine, Pye perhaps best revealed his own character and sensitivity: &#145;Those two black specks, scarcely visible among the vast eccentricities of nature, but moving up slowly, intelligently, into regions of unknown striving, remain for us a symbol of the invincibility of the human spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs FRS</span>, 204). Pye died at his home, Cuttmill Cottage, Shackleford, Godalming, Surrey, on 20 February 1960.<br>
