<span class="headword">Melville,  Frances Helen</span>  (1873&#150;1962), <span class="occ">promoter of higher education for women in Scotland and suffragist</span>, was born at 4 Abbotsford Park, Merchiston, Edinburgh, on 11 October 1873, elder daughter of Francis Suther Melville (1815&#150;1895), depute clerk of the Court of Session, and his second wife, Helen Alexandrina Kerr (1841&#150;1910). She was one of a family of five brothers and two sisters. Her early years were spent in Edinburgh, where she was educated at George Watson's Ladies' College. She went abroad as a music student to Germany for a year, but returned to be one of the first women to matriculate in 1892 at Edinburgh University after the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> of 1889 permitted women to matriculate and graduate from the Scottish universities. Her academic ability was reflected in her first-class honours MA degree in philosophy in 1897. From 1896 to 1899 she was a tutor in Professor Pringle Pattison's classes in logic, psychology, and metaphysics.<br>
<br>As one of the new band of women students Frances Melville made her mark. She was president of the first Women's Representative Committee at Edinburgh University, a forerunner of the Women's Union, at a time when the voice of women in the university was very tentative. She was present at the first meeting of the Edinburgh University Women's Debating Society and chaired the society in its first year. She took part in one of the early debates on whether women should have the franchise, signifying her interest in women's suffrage, which was to be a lifelong commitment.<br>
<br>In 1899 Melville became a lecturer in mental and moral science at the Cheltenham Ladies' College, but this proved a brief appointment because in 1900 she was appointed warden, in succession to Louisa Lumsden, of University Hall, St Andrews University, a hall of residence for women students. Under Louisa Lumsden the aim of creating a Scottish Girton at University Hall, where residential and corporate spirit would embody the ideals of women's education, had created conflicts over the relationship of hall students to other women students in the university and also in terms of the relationship of University Hall to the university itself. During her wardenship Melville did much to reduce the tensions arising from the perception of the hall as being &eacute;lite and separate, although she recognized the benefits of residential academic life. She saw to the day-to-day running of the hall and the management of its accounts and correspondence, as well as giving guidance and advice to students. She was a woman of strong, even stern, features and one student later recalled her as rather remote:<blockquote>In her earlier days young students were too much awed by her stately figure and carriage to recognise the warmth of her heart, the love of fun and the need for sympathy and affection which underlay a dignified and reserved manner. (<span class="italic">Alumnus Chronicle</span>, 45&#150;6)</blockquote>She also studied for the degree of bachelor of divinity, which she was awarded in 1910, and had the distinction of becoming the first woman to receive this degree at a Scottish university.Frances Melville left St Andrews in 1909 on her appointment as mistress of Queen Margaret College, Glasgow University, following the death of Janet Ann Galloway. Once again she was moving into an area of university life where pioneering roots were strong. Queen Margaret College had been founded by the Glasgow Association for the University Education of Women in 1883 and had become a separate college for women within Glasgow University in 1892. Most women students at the university were taught in separate classes at the college. As mistress of the college she brought to the post her wide experience of university life and her interest in the cause of women students. Her views on women's education were set out in her contribution to a collection of essays, <span class="italic">The Position of Woman: Actual and Real</span> (1911). She argued that women's education had been influenced to a damaging extent by preconceived ideas about women's capacities and prospects in life, and in particular by the artificial tension between the two ideals: of domesticity, for those intending to marry; and of professionalism, for those who were likely to be self-supporting. She favoured a general education for all women to develop their intellectual and critical faculties in the way that education for men was intended to do, but not necessarily by the same curricula and methods as were traditionally used in boys' schools and universities.<br>
<br>At Glasgow the effect of the First World War, wider social changes, and the sheer increase in numbers of women students gradually saw the full integration of women students into mixed university classes. It became impractical to run duplicate classes and the college closed in 1935. The university gave up the college buildings and Frances Melville retired to Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire. In 1927 she was awarded an LLD by Glasgow University, the first Scottish woman graduate to receive this distinction. An appointment as OBE followed in 1935.<br>
<br>Frances Melville was deeply involved in the cause of women's suffrage and a range of women's issues throughout her life. She played a prominent role in the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage and the Scottish Universities Women's Suffrage Union. She frequently gave talks or wrote papers on women's topics; in October 1902 she gave a talk in Edinburgh to the National Union of Women Workers of Great Britain entitled &#145;University education for women in Scotland: its effects on social and intellectual life&#146;. In an obituary appreciation of her it was suggested that &#145;it cost her some effort to make the public appearance that was expected of her&#146;, yet the listings of her activities and appointments suggest that she overcame this  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 10 March 1962).<br>
<br>Frances Melville was directly involved in the &#145;Scottish women graduates' case&#146; from 1906 to 1908. Since the <span class="roman">Representation of the People (Scotland) Act</span> of 1868, the universities in Scotland had returned two members of parliament, elected by graduates, as members of the general councils of the universities. As an election loomed in 1906 a group of women graduates applied to receive voting papers as members of the general council. Among these women was Frances Melville. The others were Margaret Nairn, Chrystal MacMillan, Frances Simson, and Elsie Inglis. They took the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh to the Court of Session in a case which argued that as graduates they were entitled to receive voting papers and that under the 1868 act &#145;person&#146; did not mean only male voters. They lost the case on appeal in 1907 and took it to the final court of appeal, the House of Lords, in November 1908. The case aroused great national interest, giving these suffragists an arena for their arguments to be presented and to demonstrate their ability and worthiness of receiving the vote. Although present, Frances Melville did not speak during the House of Lords case, leaving it to Chrystal MacMillan, who had been their eloquent spokeswoman throughout. The appeal, as expected, was lost.<br>
<br>Frances Melville was later honorary president of the Glasgow Women Citizens' Association and was also a member of the Glasgow Society for Equal Citizenship. She remained active in the political field and in 1938 stood as an independent candidate for a Scottish universities by-election caused by the death of Ramsay MacDonald. Sir John Anderson was elected, but she came second in the poll (ahead of a Scottish nationalist and another independent candidate) with 5618 votes. During her time in Glasgow she served as a justice of the peace, and was a member of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, the Lady Artists' Club, and the Glasgow Archaeological Society. During both world wars she was involved in a wide range of volunteer work.<br>
<br>From early on Frances Melville recognized the importance of women grouping together to promote a cause, thus creating a unity of purpose and network of support. This was most evident in the support she gave to the British Federation of University Women, an organization formed in 1907 in Manchester to create such a network of shared experience and support for the many associations of university women which had been set up throughout the country. She was responsible for the setting up of the St Andrews Association of University Women in 1909 and later served in 1935 as president of the British Federation of University Women, writing an unofficial history of the organization in 1949 and becoming honorary vice-president. In her honour a room in the headquarters at Crosby Hall was named after her. Frances Melville died at her home, 16 Merchiston Place, Edinburgh, on 7 March 1962, and was buried in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, on 9 March. Her obituarist noted that &#145;it was by the graces, no less than the strengths of her indefatigable encouragement and guardianship of women's interests that thousands of her students were equipped for later life and work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, 8 March 1962).<br>
