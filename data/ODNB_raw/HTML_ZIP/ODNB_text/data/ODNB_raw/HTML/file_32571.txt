<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cornford,  Francis Macdonald</span>  (1874&#150;1943), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Eastbourne, Sussex, on 27 February 1874, the second son of the Revd James Cornford (1840&#150;1900), and his wife, Mary Emma Macdonald. He was educated at St Paul's School under F. W. Walker and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father had studied. He won a scholarship (1894), obtained a first class in both parts of the classical tripos (1895, 1897), and was bracketed equal for the chancellor's classical medal (1897). Among the important influences upon him were Henry Jackson, Arthur Woollgar Verrall, and Walter George Headlam.<h2>
<a name="Pre1914CambridgefriendshipwithJaneHarrison"></a>Pre-1914 Cambridge: friendship with Jane Harrison</h2>Cornford considered becoming a schoolmaster but decided rather to follow an academic career, and in 1897 applied for the chair of Greek at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff. Although this application failed, he was subsequently elected a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1899; the earlier possibility of a fellowship had been delayed because of Cornford's criticism of Jackson in a thesis. After his father's death in February 1900 Cornford took responsibility for his mother. In 1902 he was appointed assistant lecturer in classics at Trinity College and lecturer in 1904. Except for the period of the First World War, almost the whole of his adult life was to be spent in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Cornford was from the first dissatisfied with the somewhat narrow nineteenth-century Cambridge ideal of &#145;pure scholarship&#146;. In an address to the newly established Cambridge Classical Society in November 1903&#151;and published as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Cambridge Classical Course: an Essay in Anticipation of Further Reform</span> (1903)&#151;Cornford (the first secretary of the society) advocated a more humane, less philological type of instruction, as well as a better co-ordinated intercollegiate lecture system in place of the semi-chaotic conditions then prevailing. He felt that:<blockquote>a course of lectures ought to be the outcome of recent first-hand work. When a man's mind is full of fresh ideas and quickened by the excitement of discovery, then is the time to lecture: there is the chance of interesting his class, while the discipline of exposition will test and clarify his thoughts.</blockquote>Recognizing that lectures ought not to repeat what can better be obtained from books, Cornford always aimed at stimulating his classes by an original treatment of his subject; the better men appreciated this, but his methods were perhaps less well suited to the ordinary minds which formed the majority of his audiences. Concurrently with lecturing he had a considerable amount of college teaching; but although he never compromised this work, his heart was from early days elsewhere, namely in writing books. Apart from the professorial lectures of his last years, it is as a writer rather than as a teacher that he is chiefly remembered.<br>
<br>One of the people who influenced Cornford's view of lecturing was the unconventional <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33734/', "Jane Harrison (1850&#150;1928)")</script> of Newnham College. Cornford had attended her lectures in 1898 (soon after her return to Cambridge), and they became close friends. Cornford associated with Jane Harrison and Gilbert Murray, and together they formed a loose group; Murray recalled of them:<blockquote>we somehow had the same general aim and outlook, or something, and the work of each contributed to the work of the others. We were out to see what things really meant, looking for a new light our elders had not seen. (Stewart, 83)</blockquote>Members of this group looked to the Near East for influences. In an attempt to get to grips with oriental languages, Cornford, Harrison, Arthur Bernard Cook, and James George Frazer were being given Hebrew lessons by Robert Hatch Kennett, the regius professor in Cambridge. Cornford and Harrison were also learning cuneiform, even taking texts on holiday to Marazion in Cornwall. Jessie Stewart recorded how she was presented with a Plasticine tablet on which Cornford had cut a cuneiform text, translated by Harrison, that celebrated the exploits of Stewart's black Russian poodle, Kapi  (Stewart, 69).<br>
<br>What primarily interested Cornford in this period was the study of those primitive modes of thought and feeling which provided the background, largely unrealized, of the writers&#151;poets, historians, and philosophers&#151;of the classical age of Greece, and the investigation of the ritual forms in which those thoughts and feelings found outward expression. Out of this group's thinking emerged Cornford's first book, <span class="italic">Thucydides mythistoricus</span> (1907), a work dedicated to Harrison as &#145;a dream which but for help and understanding would have gone up the chimney with the smoke&#146;. <span class="italic">Thucydides</span>, although highly original and stimulating, is probably the least convincing of Cornford's three books of this period; Gilbert Murray was to quote an Oxford philosopher, &#145;Much of the book is wrong, but I have learnt more from it than from any book I have read for years&#146;  (Murray, 422). Historians were not slow to challenge some of the book's arguments. An anonymous review in the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span> (1907) noted that &#145;Mr Cornford has written a most brilliant essay, but cannot be said to have penetrated below the surface of his subject&#146;  (p. 307). John Percival Postgate, in an extensive review article, concluded that Cornford had &#145;combined scientific analysis with literary form and that he has invested the conclusions of a rationalist with all the charm of a mythistorian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span>, 1907, 318).<br>
<br>Relations between Harrison and Cornford at this point were close. They frequently went on holiday together: Marazion in Cornwall and Southwold in Suffolk were two favoured spots, though they also travelled on the continent. Together they attended the first International Congress of Classical Archaeology in Athens in April 1905; around Cambridge they were also a regular sight on their bicycles, &#145;Francis very upright, with his usual rather Spanish dignity&#146;  (Stewart, 104). Both suffered from illness during 1907, which proved a turning point in their relationship. In May Cornford was struck down by appendicitis, a condition which had caused the death, in 1901, of Harrison's friend, R. A. Neil, tutor at Pembroke College. This fear may have induced Harrison's spell of blindness during Cornford's convalescence in Southwold that June.<br>
<br>Cornford had long played an active part in Cambridge life. In May 1897 he had supported degrees for women and helped to organize an undergraduate petition in its favour. He had been a member of the editorial committee of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span> since 1897 and became editor in 1899; a number of his poems were published there between 1903 and 1908, including &#145;The academic dilemma&#146; and &#145;A ballad of cadavers, or, The <span class="smallcap">MATERIAL</span> needs of the medical school&#146;. He had a reputation for composing Latin valentines, represented by his <span class="italic">Quaestiones Valentinianae</span> (1902). Cornford prepared an anonymous flysheet, <span class="italic">Compulsory Chapel</span> (1904), which provoked a flysheet response from Russell Kerr Gaye&#151;and eventually ended compulsory chapel at Trinity College in 1913. Pamphlets distributed in 1910 by William Chawner, master of Emmanuel College, promoted a rationalist position in the university, and in the wake of the controversy Cornford and Charles Kay Ogden were responsible for founding the Cambridge Society of Heretics. One of Cornford's lectures to the society was published as <span class="italic">Religion in the University</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Cornford was also active in wider circles, speaking on university education to the Oxford and London Fabian societies (1910). One of his long-lasting commitments was to the Working Men's College, then meeting in Great Ormond Street in London, for which he had helped to establish an annual summer course in Cambridge in 1901; George Macaulay Trevelyan, who introduced Cornford to the Working Men's College, recalled that &#145;Cornford was devoted to the men he met there, more I think than to the average of his pupils at Cambridge&#146;  (Trevelyan, 24).<h2>
<a name="MicrocosmographiaacademicaandFrancesDarwin"></a>Microcosmographia academica and Frances Darwin</h2>The wit and light satire of Cornford's vision for classics in Cambridge found fuller scope in <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span> (1908), originally anonymous. It was a skit on university politics, &#145;one of the few university satires&#146;, it has been said, &#145;which have outlived their occasion&#146;. It contained pictures of the &#145;Young Man in a hurry&#146; who &#145;is afflicted with a conscience, which is apt to break out, like measles, in patches&#146;. It also responded to the growth of science as a subject at Cambridge, noting the &#145;Adullamites&#146; who &#145;inhabit a series of caves near Downing Street&#146;.<br>
<br>The success of the <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span> brought Cornford into contact with a young woman, an episode which was to alter his relationship with Harrison. Frances Darwin [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32570/', "Cornford, Frances Crofts (1886&#150;1960)")</script>], the only daughter of Ellen Crofts (1856&#150;1903), one of Harrison's closest friends at Newnham College, and the botanist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32717/', "Francis Darwin (1848&#150;1925)")</script>, son of Charles Darwin, had recently returned to Cambridge after recuperation following her mother's death. Frances had been intrigued by <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span>, and Harrison, a close family friend of the Darwins, arranged a tea party in Lent term 1908, so that Frances could meet Cornford. Their friendship developed during a production of Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> in July 1908 as part of the celebrations for Milton's tercentenary, supported by Cornford as treasurer of the Marlowe Society. During rehearsals the cousins Frances and Gwen Darwin persuaded the producers, Justin and Rupert Brooke, that Cornford, &#145;in spite of his great age&#146; should be Comus  (Stewart, 109). (The &#145;great age&#146;&#151;of thirty-four&#151;is no doubt a hint at Cornford's view, expressed in <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span>, that middle age started at thirty-five.) Cornford, who acted in the production anonymously, subsequently acquired the nickname Comus.<br>
<br>While accompanying Harrison, who was convalescing after surgery, to Braunton, Devon, Cornford successfully proposed to Frances Darwin. He was not insensitive to Harrison's feelings for him, and wrote to Frances, &#145;About Aunt Jane we shall have to be thoughtful. You see she and I were both rather lonely people, we foregathered and made friends and we have been a good deal together&#146;  (Stewart, 109). Their formal engagement was announced in early October 1908. That Christmas Frances painted a card showing herself, her father, Cornford, and Harrison, all bearing or leading pigs, in a direct reference to the Greek cult practice at the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis in Attica. In July 1909 they married in a register office. Their first child, Helena, was born in 1913.<br>
<br>Harrison found her relationship with Cornford strained. She seems to have hoped that one day they would marry, or that they could have continued in their semi-married status: &#145;I had come back from Death &hellip; just to find the man I always called my &#147;Rock of Ages&#148; slipping away from me&#146;  (Beard, 157). Cornford was now nicknamed Zeus and Frances Old One, the name given to one of Harrison's favourite toy bears. She and Cornford were, however, able to work together again. Cornford contributed a chapter on the origin of the Olympic games to Harrison's <span class="italic">Themis</span> (1912) as a refutation of Professor William Ridgeway's theories. He now concentrated on ancient philosophy and his next book, <span class="italic">From Religion to Philosophy: a Study in the Origins of Western Speculation</span> (1912), was dedicated to his father-in-law, Francis Darwin. The work is notable for its penetrating interpretation of the pre-Socratic thinkers. Gilbert Murray had contributed an essay, &#145;Excursus on ritual forms preserved in Greek tragedy&#146;, to Harrison's <span class="italic">Themis</span>. This was in part the inspiration for Cornford's <span class="italic">The Origin of Attic Comedy</span> (1914), which analysed the structure of Aristophanes' plays in order to detect the ritual sequence lying behind them.<br>
<br>During the First World War Cornford, who had been a member of the Cambridge University rifle volunteers, was soon enlisted and to the surprise of his friends Rupert Brooke and Gilbert Murray became a musketry instructor at Grantham. In December 1915 Cornford's first son was born, named Rupert John in honour of Brooke, who had died that April. Now a commissioned officer holding the rank of captain, Cornford transferred to the Ministry of Munitions, of whose founding he wrote an anonymous satirical account, <span class="italic">The First Book of Munitions called Genesis</span>, &#145;in the style of the first chapter of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, with the contrary views of Jahvist and Elohist strongly marked in accordance with a burning controversy of the time&#146;  (Murray, 431; copy in Trinity College Library). He was involved in the attempt to have Bertrand Russell restored to his fellowship at Trinity.<br>
<br>Cornford's return to life in Cambridge was dominated by Frances's serious bout of depression; this seems to have followed the birth of a third child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51618/', "Christopher Francis Cornford")</script>, later an artist and writer, in February 1917. Virginia Woolf observed to Vanessa Bell:<blockquote>The poor woman has a delusion that she must never be tired, and has now spent 2 years in going from rest cure to rest cure. She refuses to see either her husband or children. The doctors have at last sent her home, but think she may be incurable. (<span class="italic">Letters of Virginia Woolf</span>, 2.377, no. 1068, 17 July 1919)</blockquote>Gilbert Murray commented that this illness &#145;brought out [Cornford's] infinite practical helpfulness and patience&#146;  (Murray, 432). The Cornfords had two more children: a son born in 1921, and a daughter in 1924.<h2>
<a name="Ancientphilosophy"></a>Ancient philosophy</h2>On the death of Henry Jackson in 1921 Cornford was an unsuccessful candidate for the regius professorship of Greek. He presented a lecture, &#145;The beginnings of natural science: Euripides, <i>Melanippe the wise</i>, frag. 484 (N2)&#146;, described by Harrison as &#145;a beautiful sermon quite over their heads&#151;the row of old cabmen who were electors looked bothered&#146;  (Harrison to Murray, 17 Nov 1921, Bodl. Oxf., MSS G. Murray). <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span> was reissued under Cornford's name in 1922, and dedicated to Edward Granville Browne, Sir Thomas Adams's professor of Arabic. Cornford added a short preface, including the comment that the first edition had lacked a chapter on &#145;propaganda&#146; which he &#145;defined as that branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite deceiving your enemies&#146;. Further editions appeared in 1933, 1949, 1953, 1964, and 1970.<br>
<br>Cornford's work now became more strictly concerned with ancient philosophy. He published important papers: &#145;Mysticism and science in the Pythagorean tradition&#146; (<span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span>, 16, 1922), and &#145;Anaxagoras' theory of matter&#146; (<i>ibid</i>., 24, 1930). He also prepared <span class="italic">Greek Religious Thought from Homer to Alexander</span> (1923), consisting of translated extracts with a valuable introduction. In 1927 he was appointed Brereton-Laurence reader in classics (with special direction to instruct in ancient philosophy). At the same time he assisted Philip Henry Wicksteed, who had been working on a translation of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Physics</span> but had been &#145;overtaken by paralysis and symptoms of approaching death&#146;  (Murray, 426), and took dictation of the manuscript. Cornford subsequently prepared the notes as two volumes in the <span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span> (1929&#150;34), supplementing Wicksteed's free translation with an alternative rendering and masterly annotation.<br>
<br>Cornford was gaining an international reputation, and in 1928 was invited to lecture at Harvard, though he was again an unsuccessful candidate for regius professor of Greek at Cambridge. His academic contribution was finally acknowledged in 1931 when he was appointed first holder of the Laurence chair of ancient philosophy at Cambridge. His inaugural lecture was published as <span class="italic">The Laws of Motion in Ancient Thought</span> (1931). A series of four lectures presented for the board of extra-mural studies at Cambridge in August 1932 was published as <span class="italic">Before and after Socrates</span> (1932). In that same autumn he gave a series of BBC lectures under the title <span class="italic">Our Debt to the Past</span>, concluding with &#145;How Greece reconciled ethics and science&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1935 came the first of the three great commentaries on Plato's later dialogues, all published in the <span class="roman">International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method</span> series, which crown Cornford's achievement and placed him in the forefront of modern Platonic scholars: <span class="italic">Plato's Theory of Knowledge: the Theaetetus and Sophist of Plato</span> (1935); <span class="italic">Plato's Cosmology: the Timaeus of Plato Translated and with a Running Commentary</span> (1937); and <span class="italic">Plato and Parmenides: Parmenides' way of truth and Plato's Parmenides; translated with an introduction and a running commentary</span> (1939). In his last years he produced an excellent translation of the <span class="italic">Republic</span> (1941), with interpretative summary, section by section, and a judicious pruning of the encumbrances of dialogue-form. Murray observed that this work reflected &#145;Cornford's own strong interest in the same problems as they recur in modern society&#146;  (Murray, 429). Cornford supported young scholars through the creation of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Classical Studies</span> series for which he served as one of the editors. Volumes included R. P. Winnington-Ingram's <span class="italic">Mode in Ancient Greek Music</span> (1936) and J. Enoch Powell's <span class="italic">The History of Herodotus</span> (1939).<br>
<br>Life at home had been varied. Frances had become well known as a poet, but their children had given them some concern. Gilbert Murray remembered:<blockquote>His relations with a series of brilliant children, whose opinions were at times vehemently opposed to his own, and whom he encouraged &#145;to sail away like ships&#146; in pursuit of their own ideals, were a model to those parents who believe in the supreme power of affection and the value of freedom. (Murray, 432)</blockquote>Cornford's eldest son, the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37313/', "(Rupert) John Cornford")</script>, an active member of the Young Communist League, left for Spain and was killed near C&oacute;rdoba in December 1936, on or just after his twenty-first birthday, while fighting against the forces of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Cornford contributed an essay on his son's childhood to Pat Sloan's <span class="italic">John Cornford: a Memoir</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Cornford received the honorary degree of DLitt from Birmingham University in 1937 and was elected FBA in the same year. He retired from his chair in 1939. His health then started to fail. His last two papers challenged what he saw as misguided contemporary theories. &#145;The Marxist view of ancient philosophy&#146; was presented to the Classical Association (summary in <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Classical Association</span>, 39, May 1942). He was due to give a paper, &#145;Was the Ionian philosophy scientific?&#146;, to the joint congress of the Hellenic and Roman societies in September 1942, but in the end it was read by Gilbert Murray; it was subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Hellenic Studies</span> (1942). Cornford died at his home, Conduit Head, Madingley Road, Cambridge, on 3 January 1943.<br>
<br>Professor W. K. C. Guthrie, a former student, added a foreword to the 1949 edition of <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span> and published some of Cornford's works posthumously. A series of essays written between 1921 and 1943 appeared in <span class="italic">The Unwritten Philosophy and other Essays</span> (1950), along with a memoir. A more substantial work, <span class="italic">Principium sapientiae</span> (1952), contained Cornford's latest speculations on the origins of Greek philosophical thought. Fifty years after Cornford's death a tenth edition of the <span class="italic">Microcosmographia</span> was published with the further title <span class="italic">Cambridge's Classic Guide to Success in the World</span> (1993), and a foreword by Henry Chadwick. The satire's enduring qualities were reflected in the endorsement by Ray Bell, head of strategy development of British Telecom: &#145;For every young MBA in a hurry, it will save you years of struggling to find this out for yourself&#146;. Cambridge University Press also issued an edition with an essay by Gordon Johnson on Cornford's Cambridge under the title <span class="italic">University Politics</span> (1994).<br>
<br>Frances Cornford described her husband at their first encounter at a concert about 1901: &#145;a tall dark man with hair parted in a stylised way like a wig&#146;  (Stewart, 105). Virginia Woolf's impression on meeting Cornford in Cambridge in early 1923 was of &#145;a military man, of upright bearing and manly spirit&#146; although on a previous occasion &#145;he was wearing a French peasant's blouse and a red tie&#146;  (Woolf to Jacques Raverat, <span class="italic">Letters of Virginia Woolf</span>, 3.24, 30 March 1923). Gilbert Murray recalled that Cornford &#145;combined great personal charm and courtesy with a certain aloofness and apparent indifference to worldly values and received opinions&#146;  (Murray, 421).<br>
