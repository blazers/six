<span class="headword">Read,  Herbert Harold</span>  (1889&#150;1970), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 17 December 1889, at Whitstable, Kent, the third of four children of Herbert Read, dairy farmer, and his wife, Caroline Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kearn. He was descended from a long line of small farmers in east Kent, and Whitstable was to remain his family home. He was educated, with a scholarship, at Simon Langton School, Canterbury, where he became head boy, and then from 1908, at the Royal College of Science, London, where he graduated with first-class honours in 1911. After three years on the staff, during which time he gained an MSc, Read joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain. By then he had begun the revision of the already well-established <span class="italic">Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy</span>, a task he continued through eight successive editions until shortly before his death.<br>
<br>Read's career with the geological survey was interrupted by the First World War, in which he served with the Royal Fusiliers in the Mediterranean and France. He was invalided out in 1917 with the rank of corporal, his discharge papers recording him as &#145;sober and industrious and suitable for a minor post of trust&#146;! He was still a patient in hospital in Sheffield when, on 21 June 1917, he married Edith Browning (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), daughter of Frederick Thomas Browning, coal merchant.<br>
<br>When he returned to the geological survey, Read was assigned to a mapping project in north-east Scotland, his director arguing that a diet of fresh fish in the fishing villages of Banffshire would improve his health. Read's health did improve, and the posting also initiated one of the most fruitful geological research projects of that era. Beginning in Banffshire, his geological studies later extended into Sutherland and thence to Unst, the most northerly of the Shetland Islands, the resulting maps and memoirs including the classic <span class="italic">The Geology of Central Sutherland</span> (1931).<br>
<br>In 1931 Read was appointed to the chair of geology in the University of Liverpool from where, in 1939, he moved to Imperial College, London, holding the chair of geology there until his retirement in 1955. In both universities he established a strong research tradition, recruiting some of the most able students of his day. Indeed, several of the research projects that he early initiated continued long after his death, particularly those dealing with the metamorphic and migmatitic rocks of northern Scotland and Shetland, and also the granites of Donegal, Ireland. The thrust of his research concerned the nature of regional metamorphism and its variations. Above all, he was concerned with the interrelationship between metamorphic rocks and granites, and the very nature of granite itself.<br>
<br>Read's views were highly influential, not least because he was an enthusiastic teacher, a highly accomplished lecturer, and a master of lucid prose. Although never averse to the introduction of new laboratory-based techniques he retained a certain scepticism concerning the over-enthusiastic application of the early experimental results to complex geological phenomena and enjoyed his reputation as one of the most effective of disputants in some of the central debates of his time. The series of challenging addresses that he gave while presiding successively over the British Association, section C (1939), the Geologists' Association (1942&#150;4), the Geological Society of London (1947&#150;8), and as a keynote speaker at international conferences, were reprinted in book form as <span class="italic">The Granite Controversy</span> (1957), which remains a geological classic. He is said to have composed the elements of these important essays while on firewatching duties on the roof of Imperial College during the Second World War. A crowning achievement was his presidency, in 1948, of the eighteenth International Geological Congress in London.<br>
<br>Long after his retirement, Read's geological hammer continued to resound in the field, particularly in Donegal, and from his pen flowed further important contributions which included three popular textbooks, two of which were written in conjunction with Janet Watson. Read received many honours including election to the Norwegian, French, and Belgian academies. He had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1939 and in 1963 he received the royal medal. He was also awarded the Bigsby, Wollaston, Penrose, and Steinmann medals, the principal awards of the geological societies of London, the United States, and Germany. Other honours included honorary doctorates of Columbia University (1954) and Dublin (1956), and honorary membership of the Royal Irish Academy. He came to be revered as an elder statesman, both in geological circles and at Imperial College, where he was successively dean of the Royal School of Mines (1943&#150;5), pro-rector (1952&#150;5), and acting head of the college (1954&#150;5).<br>
<br>A plain-speaking and modest man, Read nevertheless viewed life with acuity, being fully awake to its vagaries. He was deeply religious, and during his many years of residence in his native Whitstable took an active part in the work of the parish. He died at his home, 35 Millstrood Road, Whitstable, on 29 March 1970, survived by his wife, Edith, and their only daughter, Marguerite.<br>
