<span class="headword">Knight,  William</span>  (1475/6&#150;1547), <span class="occ">diplomat and bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was admitted as a scholar to Winchester College in 1487, aged eleven, the son of a college tenant in London. Little is known of his family. In 1514 he referred to John Newington, mercer of London, as his kinsman, and in 1547 left a legacy to Margaret James of London, his cousin. He went up to New College, Oxford, where he was admitted scholar on 12 May 1491 and elected fellow on 12 June 1493. He vacated his fellowship in 1495. Anthony Wood claims he then entered royal service and rose to become secretary to both Henry VII and Henry VIII, but it is more likely that he went to Italy to study. He was in Ferrara studying law in 1501 and was BCL by 1504 and DCL by 28 October 1506, when he visited the English College, Rome, from London. He was incorporated as DCL at Oxford on 12 October 1531. His education overseas so influenced him that in 1516 he was described as a good Italian.<br>
<br>Knight's recorded diplomatic career, which for much of its course was shaped by Henry VIII's anti-French policy, began in June 1512 when he sailed with the marquess of Dorset and an English army to Spain as an ambassador to Ferdinand II of Aragon. His reports back to Wolsey suggest that he was closely associated with him, so much so as to arouse suspicion of him in the army's council and to threaten his personal safety there. After the army's return to England in October 1512, Knight proceeded to Ferdinand's court in the following February to negotiate a new treaty. Ferdinand's determination to maintain his truce with the French resulted in Knight's recall on 29 June 1513.<br>
<br>In February 1514 Knight was sent to the court of the regent of the Netherlands, Margaret of Savoy, to further Henry VIII's alliance with the emperor Maximilian against France and to finalize arrangements for the marriage between Charles, the emperor's heir, and Mary Tudor. The hostility of Charles's counsellors to the match and Maximilian's procrastination alerted Knight to the untrustworthiness of England's allies. In a forthright report sent on 2 May he advised Wolsey to make peace with the French, but during the summer was sent to negotiate with the Swiss to secure their aid against the French before this course was eventually taken. On 7 May 1515 he was appointed to negotiate with Charles about renewing the treaty of Windsor of 1506, and in July attended a conference at Bruges which decided that commercial grievances for the next five years should be adjudicated under the terms of the <i>intercursus magnus</i> of 1495. On 2 October he was appointed to conclude a treaty with Charles, a task completed in March 1516.<br>
<br>On 13 December 1516 Knight was appointed to convey the protest of the enemies of France who formed the Holy League to France and Venice, but on 30 December was sent to the Low Countries, instructed to draw the emperor and Charles, now king of Spain, away from French influence. In February 1517, while he was in Brussels, he became convinced of Habsburg duplicity and advised Wolsey to recall him. On 26 August 1517 he was made a commissioner to settle disputes in Calais between English and French merchants. In January 1518 he was sent as ambassador to the court of Margaret of Savoy and, apart from a visit to the ailing Emperor Maximilian (December 1518 to January 1519), remained there until returning to England in February 1519. He was appointed a commissioner to settle disputes between English merchants and the Hanse (10 June 1520) and attended the Field of Cloth of Gold on 24 June 1520.<br>
<br>In October 1521 Knight was chosen ambassador to Charles V, though the emperor demurred on account of Knight's non-noble status, which he deemed a slight to his dignity. He was also designated ambassador to the Swiss in January 1522, and, after an audience with Charles V in Brussels on 9 February, he went on to Z&uuml;rich (by 13 March), but was unable to induce the Swiss to recall their troops from French service in Milan. He returned to England in April 1522.<br>
<br>After helping to draft a treaty with the imperial commissioners concerning the wool staple in Calais, 17 January 1523, Knight returned to the court of Margaret of Savoy in April. On 22 June in that year he was commissioned to negotiate a treaty with the duc de Bourbon against Fran&ccedil;ois I, with orders to leave Margaret on pretence of going to the Swiss and, in disguise, to meet Adrian de Croy, an imperial agent, at Bourg-en-Bresse. But by the time he neared Bourg on 13 July, de Croy had already completed negotiations with Bourbon's envoys. Knight returned to his post at Brussels, taking formal leave of Margaret on 3 May 1525.<br>
<br>In 1526 Knight replaced Richard Pace as royal secretary, receiving the signet on 20 August. He began to complain of illness, and of age and failing eyesight. Even so, Henry decided to send him to the pope, probably to seek a dispensation for him to marry again without an annulment of his first marriage. When Wolsey, then in France, heard of the mission, he urged Henry that Cardinal Ghinucci was better qualified to serve his secret matter as he had more experience than Knight and better access to the pope. Knight, as instructed, met Wolsey, who was confident that he would be recalled, but Henry in further orders told him to leave for Rome immediately. Knight now had a new secret purpose: to obtain a dispensation for Henry to marry any woman, even one related in the first degree of affinity through either licit or illicit intercourse&#151;a clear reference to Anne Boleyn, who as a result of the king's earlier affair with her sister Mary was related to Henry in precisely this way.<br>
<br>Unable to delay him, Wolsey instructed Knight to make for Venice. By 4 November he was at Foligno where he waited for a safe conduct to Rome. Once this was procured, he resumed his journey. Following the sack of Rome in May 1527, Clement VII fled to Orvieto, where Knight followed and had an audience with him. He received the dispensation he requested on 23 December, but without a clause stating Henry's current marriage was invalid. He also obtained a commission for Wolsey to hear the case against Queen Katherine, but not on the terms the cardinal had wanted. Knight then made for home. Arriving at Asti early in January 1528, he was instructed by Wolsey to persuade the pope to send a second legate to England, but, as Sir Gregory Casale was nearer Orvieto, Knight continued his journey north and arrived in Calais on 3 February. His letter to Henry of 21 April shows he was aware his mission to Rome had failed. By this time he was at the French court.<br>
<br>On 27&#150;8 November 1528 Knight was included in an embassy to Fran&ccedil;ois I and the pope about the king's Great Matter. Two envoys were sent on ahead while Knight, because of his age and infirmity, followed with further instructions. By late December he was still at Calais, recovering from a tempestuous crossing, but by 8 January 1529 had reached Paris, concerned that his tardiness would be interpreted as negligence. After an audience with Fran&ccedil;ois he proceeded to Lyons, arriving late in January, where he was met by Stephen Gardiner who continued to Rome while Knight returned to the French court. Once it became clear that Fran&ccedil;ois I and Charles V were intent on making peace, Knight was included in the English delegation to negotiate with both at Cambrai (30 June). Just before the conclusion of the treaty, on 5 August, Knight was replaced by Stephen Gardiner as the king's principal secretary. Perhaps this owed less to royal displeasure with Knight than to Henry's awareness of his need for a younger, more vigorous servant. In February 1532 Knight was a delegate appointed to negotiate the renewal of the <i>intercursus magnus</i> with the emperor's commissioners. This was his last mission.<br>
<br>Knight was one of the best rewarded clerical careerists of his age. A royal chaplain by March 1513 and a protonotary apostolic by February 1514, he was rector of Barton, Bedfordshire, 1504&#150;11, of Sandhurst, Kent, 1508&#150;15, of Stowting, Kent (vacated by 1513), of Chartham, Kent, 1514&#150;15, and of All Hallows, Bread Street, London, 1515&#150;37. He was dean of the hospital and college of the Newarke, Leicester, 1515&#150;17, and prebendary of Farndon, Lincoln Cathedral, 1516&#150;41, of Horton, Salisbury Cathedral, 1517&#150;41, and of Chamberlainwood, St Paul's Cathedral, 1517&#150;41. He was rector of Romaldkirk, Yorkshire, 1518&#150;41, and also prebendary, Bangor Cathedral, 1520&#150;41, archdeacon of Chester, 1522&#150;41, and archdeacon of Huntingdon, 1523&#150;41. In addition he was rector of Bangor Monachorum, Flintshire, 1527&#150;41, prebendary of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, 1527&#150;41, archdeacon of Richmond, 1529&#150;41, and prebendary of Haselbere, Wells Cathedral, 1535&#150;41. Finally Knight was elected bishop of Bath and Wells on 23 April 1541, received the royal assent on 19 May, and was consecrated ten days later. He was granted a coat of arms on 14 July 1514.<br>
<br>Knight's slow promotion to the episcopate might be attributed to his religious conservatism. In the 1530s vacant sees often went to reformers. He paid Friar Forrest to pray for the soul of Dean Richard Wolman, and in his will made bequests to endow obits and a temporary chantry for ten years. But when religious reaction set in from 1539, his prospects became more hopeful. Henry VIII planned to include Knight's archdeaconries of Chester and Richmond in a new diocese of Chester; both were highly privileged jurisdictions and to have left them in existence would have rendered the bishop without effective jurisdictional influence in his diocese. Knight's surrender of the two archdeaconries and their appurtenances to the crown soon after his election to the bishopric of Bath and Wells smacks of a quid pro quo.<br>
<br>Knight's career as an ecclesiastic was undistinguished. As archdeacon of Richmond he was in dispute with Archbishop Lee of York by 1533 over jurisdiction. As bishop of Bath and Wells he spent much of his time at his episcopal residence at Wiveliscombe, Somerset, and it was probably there that he died, on 29 September 1547. He made several grants of presentations to livings and favourable leases, but only alienated one episcopal manor to the crown, that of Wick, Gloucestershire, on 20 June 1545.<br>
<br>In old age Knight was reputed to be wealthy. In July 1544 Henry VIII assessed him for a forced loan of &pound;3000, &pound;2000 more than the next most highly rated bishops. Knight offered 1000 marks as his &#145;free and poor gift&#146;. Under pressure another 1000 marks was extracted from him as a loan. Despite his reputed wealth, the most lavish bequest in his will of 12 August 1547 (which disposed of over &pound;500 in cash) was &pound;100 for his own tomb. New College, Oxford, was left &pound;40, and Winchester College &pound;20, while smaller charitable legacies were made to the poor, prisoners, and for the repair of the highways.<br>
<br>Knight played a significant part in the introduction of Renaissance design and architecture into England. His works at Horton Court, Gloucestershire, dated 1521, include a Renaissance-style fireplace and front doorway, and a detached loggia with four stucco roundels of figures from classical antiquity embedded in its back wall. The inscription on the former market cross at Wells, Somerset, asserted that it was built in 1542 at the expense of Knight and Dean Wolman. Within the nave of Wells Cathedral is a stone pulpit bearing Knight's arms, described as &#145;one of the earliest attempts in England at a serious understanding of the Renaissance&#146;  (Pevsner, <span class="italic">Gloucestershire</span>, 309). He is supposed to have been buried nearby.<br>
