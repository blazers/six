<span class="headword">Fairborne, Sir  Palmes</span>  (1644&#150;1680), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, was a son of the royalist Colonel Stafford Fairborne of Newark. In his teens he fought as a mercenary for the Venetians in the defence of Candia (Crete). He returned to England in 1661, when he became a captain in the newly raised Tangier regiment of foot. In January 1662 this was shipped to Tangier, where in 1664 Fairborne was promoted major. He was back in England briefly in the winter of 1665&#150;6 for a recruiting tour of the west country. By this time he had married Margaret or Margery Devereux (<i>d</i>. 1694); their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9069/', "Stafford Fairborne")</script>, was born about 1666. In March or April 1675, shortly before his return to Tangier after another spell in England, Fairborne was knighted. In May 1676 he became deputy governor in the absence of William O'Brien, earl of Inchiquin, and in January 1677 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. After two years in effective sole command of Tangier he returned to England, in 1678, and in the same year he served as commissary-general of the army in Flanders. He returned to Tangier on 8 April 1680 and became governor <i>de facto</i> in June when Inchiquin went home and his intended successor, Thomas Butler, earl of Ossory, died before he could set out. Only a fortnight before Fairborne's return, the Moors had begun their most ambitious attempt yet to reconquer the colony, the siege continuing through the summer and into the autumn. On 24 October Fairborne rode out to inspect the defences and was hit by a &#145;chance shot&#146;, according to the epitaph, penned partly by John Dryden, erected in Westminster Abbey by Fairborne's widow. He lingered long enough to see the successful counter-attack by his deputy, Colonel Sackville, which raised the siege, and died on the evening of 27 October 1680.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1660s and 1670s Fairborne's own (invariably forthright) letters, and a number of detailed accounts by others, give a vivid picture of his time at Tangier and of the life of the English garrison. Fairborne's hot temper often got him into trouble with his superiors and equals. He fought a number of duels; in 1671 he threw a bucket of water over a Mrs Pope, who had been swearing at his wife; and in 1674 he was sentenced to be shot for insubordination to the governor, the earl of Middleton, and was kept under restraint until eventually pardoned. Much of Fairborne's brashness stemmed from deep financial insecurity. He had a rapidly growing family that was always on &#145;the verge of poverty&#146;, according to the historian of Tangier  (Routh, 155), and his career displays ample evidence of concern to obtain as much money as possible from legitimate, and sometimes other, sources. He regularly sent presents to successive secretaries of state Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, and Sir Joseph Williamson; he was implicated in 1672 in the theft of jewels belonging to the Moorish ruler, Guylan; and he worried in 1680 that as a result of Ossory's appointment over his head, &#145;the small pittance of &pound;500 per annum allowed him as commander-in-chief might not be taken away &hellip; as things at Tangier are three times as dear as in England, and he had not received a farthing of pay&#146;  (Davis, 1.158&#150;60). His willingness to go behind the backs of his superiors by writing directly to England hardly endeared him to them. Nevertheless, Fairborne was far from being entirely selfish and corrupt. In 1676&#150;7 he paid for improvements to the fortifications at his own expense, and he was just as persistent in pressing for payment of the entire garrison's arrears as he was for his own. He saw clearly the link between lack of pay and lack of discipline, but came down hard on the latter: one potential mutiny was stymied when he summarily shot the ringleader.<br>
<br>During his time in the colony Fairborne fought frequent skirmishes against the Moors. In September 1675 he commanded a sortie ordered by Inchiquin, but this was revealed to be a Moorish trap and Fairborne bitterly criticized the governor to the authorities in London. On 7 January 1678 he led out the relief force to forts Henrietta and Kendal, which had been attacked by the Moors on the previous day. In the final attacks in 1680, as throughout his career, Fairborne proved himself to be a competent and cautious tactician, always aware of the limitations imposed on him by a relatively small garrison, an effective organizer, and above all a highly professional soldier of undoubted courage. Only a few days before his death, he reiterated his oft-expressed opinion that Tangier &#145;could never be made steadable to the king in no fashion&#146;  (Halkett, 12): three years after his death, the colony he had fought so hard to defend was evacuated, and its buildings blown up.<br>
<br>Fairborne's death left his widow and their seven children in the poverty he had always feared: the pension of &pound;500 per annum, granted to her by Charles II in 1681, was already &pound;1500 in arrears in 1685. On 1 April 1683 at St Marylebone, Middlesex, she married Jasper Paston, a son of the earl of Yarmouth; she died in 1698. Fairborne's eldest son, Stafford, entered the navy, and became a knight and an admiral.<br>
