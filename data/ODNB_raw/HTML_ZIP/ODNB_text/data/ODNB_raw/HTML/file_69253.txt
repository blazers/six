<span class="headword">Schilling,  Richard Selwyn Francis</span>  (1911&#150;1997), <span class="occ">biochemist and occupational physician</span>, was born on 9 January 1911 at Kessingland, Suffolk, the youngest of the four children of George Schilling (1866&#150;1935), a general practitioner, and his wife, Florence Louise Loweth (1874&#150;1950), daughter of a Lincolnshire farmer. George Schilling had studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London, after which he held various hospital appointments and served as a ship's doctor. He then combined a one-man general practice with other local appointments including assistant medical officer to the Great Western Railway works hospital. An alcoholic, he died suddenly in May 1935.<br>
<br>Richard Schilling boarded from the age of fourteen at Epsom College, where he excelled in rugby football, cricket, and boxing, and from which he passed the first MB. A scholarship enabled him to study medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, which he also represented at sport. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1934, and this allowed him to start immediately in practice; thus, when his father died Richard was able to maintain the general practice until it could be sold as a going concern. He completed the MB BS London in 1937, and on 28 August that year he married Heather, daughter of Clem Norman, a Dorset general practitioner. In a supremely happy marriage they raised a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Schilling began his career in occupational medicine late in 1935, when he joined ICI Metals as an assistant industrial medical officer. In 1939 he became a medical officer of factories in Manchester. He had joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1938 as a lieutenant. At the outbreak of war he was in France with a field ambulance and was evacuated from Dunkirk. Recalled to the factory inspectorate in 1940, he was seconded as secretary of the industrial health research board in 1942, when he participated in field studies with Donald Hunter in his department for research in industrial medicine at the London Hospital. In 1947 Schilling joined Professor R. E. Lane at the Manchester University department of occupational health, combining this work with part-time practice in an engineering works. In 1956 he was appointed director of the Rockefeller occupational health unit within the department of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a reader in the University of London. The unit became an independent department in 1959, with Schilling as its professor from 1960. In 1968 the department became an institute endowed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and it was formally opened by HM the queen mother in 1971.<br>
<br>Schilling was a key figure in the expansion of occupational medicine from a minor interest to a recognized field of medicine, with its own faculty of occupational medicine formed in 1978 within the Royal College of Physicians, London. Although he was involved in early discussions and became a fellow of the faculty, Schilling remained largely detached from its development and it is not mentioned in his autobiography. He published on his investigations into byssinosis of cotton workers, the role of carbon disulphide in heart disease, and the health of seafarers, and he contributed to the committee of inquiry into trawler safety, whose report was published in 1969.<br>
<br>A big man physically, Schilling was easy to deal with, but had firm principles and strong but well controlled feelings and a warm, infectious sense of humour. He was outstanding not only for his leadership, his scientific contributions and pre-eminent position in what was a relatively new and developing field, and as a teacher, but also for his humanity. He regarded himself as being the odd man out in his family in holding liberal or left-wing views and in being concerned for the underprivileged; his idealism and humanity shines through his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Challenging Life: Sixty Years in Occupational Health</span> (1998). Associated with the <span class="italic">British Journal of Industrial Medicine</span> (now <span class="italic">Occupational and Environmental Health</span>) since 1942 and as editor from 1951 to 1955, he established the journal as one of international scientific merit, and himself contributed numerous articles.<br>
<br>Various presidencies, honorary fellowships, and other academic qualifications were conferred on Schilling; these culminated in his appointment as CBE in 1975. When he retired in 1976 his institute had an outstanding international reputation for teaching and research, but it was disbanded in September 1990, allegedly because the university was disenchanted by its links with the TUC and by the difficulty of recruiting a professor of suitable stature. In his autobiography Schilling himself referred to the closure of the institute as &#145;an act of economic vandalism [which] was the greatest blow to my professional career&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Challenging Life</span>, 158). Latterly, as a consultant to Possum Controls, he was involved in improvements in the quality of life for the disabled. Schilling died of cancer at his home, 11C Prior Bolton Street, Canonbury, London, on 30 September 1997. After a plain funeral at the church he had attended at Hackney he was cremated at Finchley on 7 October 1997.<br>
