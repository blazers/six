<span class="headword">Herland,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1406?), <span class="occ">master carpenter</span>, was the presumed son of <a name="cosubject_42233"></a><span class="headword">William Herland</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1375), master <span class="occ">carpenter</span> to Edward III. William first appears <i>c</i>.1332 as a sawyer of moulds at St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, where William Hurley was master carpenter. He was also employed at the Tower, where his duties involved the maintenance of siege engines, and in 1338 he conveyed a &#145;great engine&#146; to Scotland. By 1347 Herland's status had risen to that of Hurley's warden (<i>apparillator</i>) at St Stephen's; later he held the same post at Windsor <i>c</i>.1350, receiving the normal warden's salary (6<i>d</i>. to 8<i>d</i>. a day) for his work on the choir stalls of St George's Chapel and the ceiling of the chapter house between October 1351 and July 1352. Herland was simultaneously employed on the stalls at St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster. Upon Hurley's death in 1354, Herland received the full master's salary of 1<i>s</i>. a day, succeeding Hurley as head carpenter both at Westminster and at Windsor, where he worked in the 1360s on Edward III's new apartments in the upper bailey. William Herland's designation as &#145;chief carpenter&#146; suggests he was in charge of the major Windsor carpentry, which included a new hall, kitchen, kitchen gate, alterations to the chapel, and the conversion of Henry III's hall into a chamber. He certainly made the roof of the cloister in the lower bailey (1355&#150;7) and, although it is not documented, it is probable that he designed (<i>c</i>.1361) the elaborate open-timber roof of St George's hall (now destroyed, but its appearance is recorded in an engraving by W. Hollar, 1663), executed by his warden following the completion of the undercroft in 1362/3. It is not known whether Hugh Herland was among the carpenters involved with this important decorative roof.<br>
<br>As Edward III's chief carpenter and administrator, William Herland contracted carpenters for the king's works, for instance at Hadleigh Castle, Essex (June 1358); the king's house at Rotherhithe, Surrey (1361&#150;75), where he was comptroller; Eltham Palace, Kent; and the new castle of Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey (1367&#150;72), where William Wykeham was the initial overseer and where Hugh Herland was paid 8<i>d</i>. a day for making &#145;springalds&#146;, catapults for hurling stones which had become semi-portable weapons by the late fourteenth century. Since both Herlands worked as military &#145;engineers&#146;, clearly this aspect of the craft remained an important component of a carpenter's skills at that time.<br>
<br>As a reward for his long service, in 1371 William Herland was given a tenement in London and it was probably here that he died, in 1375. His office of &#145;disposer of the king's works&#146; was then transferred to Hugh Herland. William's will, enrolled in the court of hustings (16 July 1375) indicates that he was survived by his wife, Agnes, but mentions no children.<br>
<br>Hugh Herland's career began <i>c</i>.1360 as the king's under-carpenter at Westminster, the Tower, and Windsor Castle, at the last of which he probably met his future patron, William Wykeham. In 1360 both Herlands were issued with robes from the great wardrobe and in 1369 each received a mourning robe for the funeral of Philippa of Hainault, at which time William Herland ranked among the &#145;esquires of great estate&#146;, while Hugh was an esquire of craftsman's rank (<i>de mistere</i>). Given this close association with the royal household, they may have collaborated on the wooden tester above Philippa's fine alabaster effigy in Westminster Abbey, prepared before her death by the sculptor, Jean de Li&egrave;ge; similarly, Hugh may have executed the tester above the tomb of Edward III, also in Westminster Abbey, following the king's death in 1377.<br>
<br>In 1375 Hugh succeeded his father as chief carpenter, and after a brief hiatus (1377/8) received a new patent &#145;for life&#146; from Richard II in 1379 as one of two chief carpenters. He remained &#145;disposer of the king's works of carpentry&#146; until his retirement in 1404/5. During his long career Hugh Herland executed numerous works for the crown and supervised the royal castles south of the rivers Trent and Humber, including Carisbrooke, Isle of Wight (1384/5), Winchester (1390), and Portchester, Hampshire (<i>c</i>.1385 and 1396&#150;9), where Herland and Henry Yevele presumably administered the works for Richard II's new domestic range, employing Thomas Clevere, who received the warden's wage of 6<i>d</i>. a day.<br>
<br>Herland's most important work in the 1390s was unquestionably the new roof for the Norman aisled hall at Westminster Palace, the largest medieval hall in England. For this vast <i>renovatio</i> Herland was not only the master carpenter but also served as comptroller to John Godmaston, clerk of the works (Herland's account survives as BL, Add. Roll 27018). Herland made the oak framing during 1394&#150;6 at a site near Farnham, Surrey, after which the timbers were transported piecemeal to London for assembly in 1397. The complex roof structure (ingeniously preserved by Sir Frank Baines in the early twentieth century) spans nearly 68 feet internally and combines a massive arch structure with angels and hammer beam brackets, each bearing the royal arms of Richard II. In 1399 Hugh was reappointed by Henry IV to act as comptroller to Godmaston for repairs made to the great hall and to the outer gate of the palace at Westminster, for which he was instructed to report directly to the exchequer.<br>
<br>In addition to works for the crown, Herland was employed in 1387 by William Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, at the latter's manor of Highclere, Hampshire, and also worked at Wykeham's collegiate foundations at Winchester and New College, Oxford (founded 1379). Accompanied by his servants, Herland dined at New College nine times in 1390/91. While little original work remains, the chapel vault at St Mary's College, Winchester (1393/4) survives; moreover, Herland's likeness (with inscription) appears in the east window of the chapel, along with representations of the master mason, William Wynford, and of Simon Membury, clerk of the works. At Oxford, contextual evidence suggests that the New College chapel roof (rebuilt by Gilbert Scott), possibly designed by Herland, was of a low-pitched angel hammer beam type. The William Herland of Kingston, Surrey, listed as one of Wykeham's original scholars of Winchester College and admitted as a scholar to New College in July 1397, was very likely Hugh's son.<br>
<br>In recognition of his long and expert service, Herland received various annuities and grants. As early as 1383 he received a patent of 1<i>s</i>. a day for life, and in 1391, in return for his good service, he was granted an additional 10 marks a year for life from the fee farm of Winchester. In 1397 Richard II granted Herland an annual pension of &pound;18 5<i>s</i>. from the exchequer. These patents were reconfirmed by Henry IV (1399 and 1403). Herland not only increased his income but was also given a house &#145;in the little outward ward&#146; of Westminster Palace about 1386, to keep his tools and moulds. A property transaction of July 1391 records the quitclaim to a certain Hugh Herlande, his wife, Joan of &#145;Upchirche of Kent&#146;, and their heirs, of a substantial property at Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. Given Master Hugh's income and status, and the proximity of Kingston to Herland's framing site, it is very likely that this refers to Hugh Herland, the king's carpenter. The last recorded payment of Herland's pension was made on 13 May 1406, suggesting that he died within the year. He appears to have had three sons, Thomas, William, and John.<br>
