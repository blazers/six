<span class="headword">Baird, Sir  John</span>, Lord Newbyth  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized in Edinburgh on 10 September 1620, the son of James Baird (<i>d</i>. 1655) of Little Fiddes and Byth, Aberdeenshire, advocate, and his wife, Bethia, daughter of John Dempster of Logiealton and Balbougie, advocate. He was admitted advocate on 3 June 1647. Probably about this time he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. after 1618, <i>d</i>. 1707), daughter of Sir William Hay of Linplum, because a son was born on 4 October 1648; the couple had two further sons and a daughter. By June 1653 Baird had been knighted.<br>
<br>Like his father, who died in August 1655, Baird was a covenanter, although he was quickly reconciled to the Restoration after 1660. He served as commissary of Edinburgh in 1661. He was excepted out of the Scottish <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> in 1662, paying a fine of &pound;2400. On 15 August 1663 he was appointed Lyon-depute. In November 1664 he was made a lord of session; since he had sold the Byth estate, he assumed the title of Lord Newbyth, based on lands he purchased in Haddingtonshire. Elected to the Scottish parliament in 1665 for Aberdeenshire, after taking the oaths on 8 August he was named to prepare a draft of a grant of taxation to the king. Returned again to the parliament in 1667, on 9 January he was appointed to the committee of supply.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1667 the king granted Baird the barony of Gilmertoun within the sheriffdom of Edinburgh; the grant was ratified by parliament on 23 December 1669. From September to November 1670 Baird was in London attending meetings as a Scottish commissioner for union with England. He was one of those left out of the new commission for lords of session on 1 November 1681, no doubt due to his political opposition to the harsh measures taken against opponents of the government. In 1685 he served as a commissioner of the cess and of supply in Edinburghshire.<br>
<br>Baird clearly welcomed the revolution of 1688 in Scotland. He was again appointed a commissioner of supply in Edinburghshire in 1689 and 1690. More difficulty seems to have occurred over his reappointment as a lord of session. In June 1689 he wrote to the Scottish secretary of state, the earl of Melville, of his surprise that &#145;I had not that common measure of justice allowed me, which was given to such of the lords of session who had suffered under the violence of the last government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leven and Melville Papers</span>, 107&#150;8). Evidently his plea for reinstatement was heeded, for on 22 October he was named in the new commission. He retained his place until his death in Edinburgh on 27 April 1698. He was succeeded by his son William, who had been created a baronet in 1680. His daughter apparently died in a coaching accident shortly before she was due to be married. In the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh there survive Lord Newbyth's collections of decisions from 1664 to 1667 and a collection of practiques for 1664 to 1681.<br>
