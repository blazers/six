<span class="headword">Pember,  Edward Henry</span>  (1833&#150;1911), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, the eldest son of John Edward Ross Pember of Clapham Park, Surrey, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Arthur Robson, was born at his parents' house on 28 May 1833. He was educated at Harrow School and briefly taught by T. Elwin, headmaster of Charterhouse School. He matriculated on 23 May 1850 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was elected a student in 1854. He took a first class in classical moderations in 1852, and in 1854 he gained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and a third class in law and modern history. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 2 May 1855, reading in the chambers first of the conveyancer Joseph Burrell and then of George Markham Giffard. Called to the bar on 26 January 1858, he chose the midland circuit, and sought common-law practice. On 28 August 1861 he married Fanny, only daughter of William Richardson of Sydney, New South Wales, who survived him. His eldest and only surviving son, Francis William, became fellow of All Souls in 1884 and bursar in 1911.<br>
<br>Briefs were slow in coming when a fortunate accident introduced Pember to the parliamentary bar. For that class of work and tribunal Pember was well equipped. His presence, his command of English, together with his quickness of comprehension and his readiness in repartee, soon made him a prime favourite with the committees of both houses. Perhaps the most notable achievement in his career was his conduct of the bill for creating the Manchester Ship Canal, which was passed in July 1885 in the face of fierce opposition. His speeches were well prepared and literary. His treatment of witnesses was not always adroit, and he was over-prone to argument with experts. But his straightforwardness was admired. In April 1897 he appeared as counsel for Cecil Rhodes before the parliamentary committee appointed to investigate the origin and attendant circumstances of the Jameson raid. Pember took silk in 1874, was made a bencher of his inn in 1876, and served the office of treasurer in 1906&#150;7. He retired from practice in 1903 in good health.<br>
<br>Pember was throughout his life a prominent figure in the social and literary life of London. He was an accomplished musician, having studied singing under Perugini, and possessed considerable technical theoretical knowledge. In 1910 he was elected perpetual secretary of the newly formed academic committee of the Royal Society of Literature. He was a constant contributor to the weekly press. He also produced a considerable amount of private writing, particularly classical translations from Greek and Latin and, later, classical plays in English produced for private audiences. He contributed &#145;Lives of early Italian musicians&#146; to George Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music</span> (1878&#150;90).<br>
<br>Pember died after a short illness on 5 April 1911, at his Hampshire home, Vicar's Hill, Lymington, and was buried at Boldre church, Brockenhurst.<br>
