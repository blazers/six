<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Philip</span>, second earl of Chesterfield  (1633&#150;1714), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born in the parish of St Mary Cray, Kent, the eldest son of Henry Stanhope, styled Lord Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1634), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15669/', "Katherine Stanhope (bap. 1609, d. 1667)")</script>, daughter and coheir of Thomas, second Baron Wotton. His father died in November 1634, and in the same year Stanhope survived an attack of the smallpox. Until the age of seven he resided at Lord Wotton's seat. In 1641 his mother married John Poliander Kirkhoven, lord of Hemfleet, in the Netherlands, and Stanhope spent the next few years there. He was educated by Kirkhoven's father, the professor of divinity at Leiden. He also studied at the prince of Orange's college at Breda and spent time at the courts of the queen mother and princess royal. Stanhope matriculated at Leiden on 4 June 1649. Next he went to Paris where he attended Monsieur de Veau's academy, which he left after a duel. At the start of November 1650 he left Paris <i>en route</i> for Rome in the company of William Swan, and a tutor, John Bargrave. He was present in Turin at the wedding on 11 December 1650 of Ferdinand Maria, elector of Bavaria, to Henrietta Adelaide of Savoy. He was in Rome by 29 April 1651 when he dined at the English College. He then moved on, signing the visitors' register at Padua on 30 October 1651, and also visiting Naples, Venice, and Milan.<br>
<br>Stanhope returned to England via Germany and the Netherlands, and in April 1652 he petitioned the committee for compounding claiming that his grandfather (Philip Stanhope, first earl of Chesterfield) had repossessed the manor of Sawley after his father's death, and it had then been sequestrated. On 21 June 1652 he married Lady Anne Percy (1633&#150;1654), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21923/', "Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland")</script>. She died of the smallpox on 29 November 1654, eight days after the birth of a son, who survived her for only three weeks. As a consequence of this bereavement Stanhope obtained a pass on 27 June 1655 to travel to France, and after a short sojourn in Paris he went on to Rome. His return to England was occasioned by the death of his grandfather on 12 September 1656, and an attempt by his uncle, Arthur Stanhope, to seize his estate for debt. Apparently Oliver Cromwell tried to entice Chesterfield into marriage with one of his daughters and offered him a military command, which Chesterfield refused. A proposed match with a daughter of Lord Fairfax was called off after they had been &#145;thrice asked in St. Martin's Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 19). Chesterfield was at this time engaged in affairs with Barbara Villiers (<i>bap</i>. 1640, <i>d</i>. 1709) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28285/', "Palmer, Barbara")</script>] (later duchess of Cleveland and mistress of Charles II) and Lady Elizabeth Howard (<i>c</i>.1638&#150;1714) (who later married John Dryden). On 16 February 1658 Chesterfield and Lord St John were arrested to prevent an intended duel, and on 8 June of the same year Chesterfield was held in the Tower after a duel with a Captain Whalley MP. In September 1659 he was accused of complicity in Sir George Booth's rising, but although he was imprisoned in the Tower, the county committee in Derbyshire could not find sufficient evidence to warrant the seizure of his estate.<br>
<br>Although involved in royalist plots, Chesterfield was perceived as too far engaged with his mistresses to be a major influence. In any case he had to flee the country following the death of Francis Wolley, the son of a Hammersmith doctor, whom he had killed in a duel on 17 January 1660 over the price of a mare. He subsequently sought the pardon of Charles II at Breda, and was able to join the king on his journey into England. Shortly before 25 September 1660 Chesterfield married Lady Elizabeth Butler (1640&#150;1665), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4191/', "James Butler, first duke of Ormond")</script>. They had a son, who died as an infant, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Chesterfield was appointed on 24 February 1662 as lord chamberlain to Queen Catherine of Braganza, and in parliament he seems to have been a court supporter, voting against the impeachment of Clarendon in 1663. Life at court, however, proved difficult for Chesterfield as it was reported in November 1662 that the duke of York was &#145;smitten in love&#146;  (Pepys, 3.248) with his countess, and that Chesterfield had taken her away from court into Derbyshire on that account. Chesterfield resigned his court post in 1665. His wife died of the &#145;spotted fever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 25) in July 1665, being buried on the 18th. Chesterfield also contracted the disease, but recovered.<br>
<br>On 13 June 1667 Chesterfield was made the colonel of a foot regiment to be raised for active service, but it was disbanded following the treaty of Breda. In 1668 he appears to have travelled to Bourbon in France to take the waters. When Ormond visited Oxford University in his capacity as chancellor on 15 July 1669, Chesterfield was made a DCL. That year he married Lady Elizabeth Dormer (1653&#150;1677), daughter and coheir of Charles Dormer, second earl of Carnarvon. They had two sons and two daughters. On 17 March 1670 he was named steward of the honour of Tutbury. Most of 1670 appears to have been spent attending to the house and gardens at Bretby, in Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Chesterfield opposed the declaration of indulgence in 1672, and on 22 November 1675 he voted for an address to Charles II to dissolve parliament. In both 1668 and 1674 he had entrusted his proxy to peers who were now in opposition, and in 1676 Halifax wrote to persuade Chesterfield to attend the next parliamentary session. Shortly before 24 October 1677 his wife died, a week after a miscarriage, Ormond writing of &#145;the very uneasy and uncomfortable condition your lady lived long in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.57). The death of his wife led to rumours of melancholia during 1678, and Chesterfield confessed to staying in his chamber for six months. He was one of the few protestant peers who returned to the court fold in the years before 1679 and he seems to have forgiven the duke of York, who wrote from his exile in The Hague in April 1679 of Chesterfield's &#145;expressions of kindness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 1.28). In December 1679 Chesterfield replaced the disgraced duke of Monmouth as chief justice in eyre south of the Trent. He voted on 15 November 1680 against the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, having spoken in the Lords of his fear of another republic, for &#145;the blood of the last king has left an eternal stain upon this kingdom&#146;  (Swatland, 115). He also voted on 23 November 1680 against a motion for a joint committee of both houses to debate the safety of the kingdom, and on 7 December for a verdict of not guilty against the Roman Catholic peer Viscount Stafford, accused of involvement in the Popish Plot. On 26 January 1681 he was sworn a member of the privy council, an appointment York was in hearty agreement with, and he duly attended the third Exclusion Parliament in March. On 6 November 1682 he succeeded the earl of Mulgrave as colonel of the 3rd regiment of foot guards (relinquishing it on 26 January 1684 over a question of precedence). He spent the summer of 1683 rebuilding Bretby, which had been badly damaged by fire in 1680. In February 1684 he stood as surety for the earl of Danby upon his release from the Tower.<br>
<br>Chesterfield acted as lord sewer at James II's coronation, but in October 1685 he resigned as chief justice in eyre pleading ill health&#151;&#145;I am fit for nothing but a retirement, being very seldom free either from the stone or gout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 7.379). He left his proxy in the hands of the marquess of Halifax. His name appears on a list of November 1687 of those opposed to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Although approached by the earl of Danby in the autumn of 1688, he refused to join in the Orangist conspiracy, but nor did he reveal the plot to the king. Chesterfield's actions in joining the forces raised in the midlands following the invasion were prompted by a desire to safeguard Princess Anne, who had fled to Nottingham. Here he proved obstinate in his loyalty to the king, refusing to join a council of war, and refusing an association promoted by the earl of Devonshire to destroy all papists in England should the prince of Orange be killed or murdered. When he left the princess in mid-December, he retired to Bretby.<br>
<br>In the convention of 1688&#150;9, Chesterfield was initially a supporter of a regency, voting on 31 January 1689 against declaring William and Mary king and queen. On 4 February he voted against agreeing with the Commons that James II had &#145;abdicated&#146; and that the throne was &#145;vacant&#146;. Crucially, on 6 February, despite attending a conference between the houses, Chesterfield was not present to vote when the Lords agreed to these resolutions. He refused all offers of employment from William III, and seems to have held that William should only be accorded allegiance as <i>de facto</i> monarch. He remained a tory opponent of the court, supporting the place bill in the 1692&#150;3 session, and refusing the association to defend William of 1696, and the abjuration of the Pretender in 1702.<br>
<br>Chesterfield remained active in local politics, supporting his tory son-in-law Thomas Coke in Derbyshire elections in 1701&#150;2. He waited on Queen Anne shortly after her accession. In retirement Chesterfield divided his time between London and Bretby. In April 1705 he was reported to be &#145;so well again that he can scarce find a complaint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cowper MSS</span>, 3.59), although the marriage of his youngest daughter in 1706 left him &#145;a perfect hermit&#146;  (ibid., 72). On 30 November 1708 he was elected a FRS. Chesterfield died on 28 January 1714 at his house in Southampton Square, London, and was buried on 12 February at Shelford, Nottinghamshire. His son Philip Stanhope succeeded him as third earl of Chesterfield.<br>
