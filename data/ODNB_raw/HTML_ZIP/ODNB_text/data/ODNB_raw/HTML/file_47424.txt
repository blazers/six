<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1854&#150;1916), <span class="occ">businessman and stockbroker</span>, was born on 28 March 1854 at Kingsdown, Bristol, the second son of Henry White, a painter and decorator, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tippetts, a domestic servant before her marriage. After attending St Michael's Boys' School in Bristol, he joined a legal firm in the city, Stanley and Wasborough, in 1869, as a junior clerk. He soon impressed by his dedication and grasp of detail. Following the passage of the 1870 <span class="roman">Tramways Act</span>, he played a major part in the promotion of the Bristol Tramways Company (1874) by Stanley and Wasborough on behalf of a group of local businessmen. He married Caroline Rosena Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1915) in 1876; they had two children.<br>
<br>In 1875 White left the law, and was appointed secretary of the Bristol Tramway Company, later serving as managing director and chairman. During his career, he was also involved in running tramway companies in Bath, Dublin, Middlesbrough, Reading, and York. In west London, White's London United Tramways, established in 1894, created a major suburban network along the main roads radiating from its Hammersmith terminus. In the later 1890s he was a pioneer of electric tramways, demonstrating that electrification, though very capital intensive, offered improved services for the general public and attractive returns for investors. His creation of major transport systems in Bristol and west London was among his greatest achievements. White's career was not confined to tramways, but encompassed all forms of mechanized transport. Under his leadership, the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company began operating motor buses and taxis, entering vehicle production in 1908. By 1914 it was among the biggest employers in Bristol, with a workforce of over 2000.<br>
<br>White managed many of his interests through his stockbroking firm, George White &amp; Co. (established in 1875). His business was strongly regional in nature and very profitable. As well as dealing on behalf of clients, he often acquired an interest in ailing companies that were ripe for restructuring, or could profitably be sold to rivals. His many contacts with leading Bristol businessmen ensured that he had no difficulty raising capital for his ventures. Bristol companies in which he had a major interest included the Great Western Steamship Company, the Bristol Port and Channel Dock Company (which had built Avonmouth docks), and the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. In 1882&#150;3 he played a leading role in the abortive scheme to provide Bristol with an alternative to the Great Western Railway's link with London. Like many Bristolians, he had strong ties with south Wales. He was chairman of the Main Colliery Company, and chaired the shareholders' committee of the Taff Vale Railway, in which he had a large shareholding. In 1891, when the Taff Vale's profits slumped, he removed the entire board of directors, replacing them with his own nominees.<br>
<br>The crowning achievement of White's career was the establishment of the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company in 1910, and also of its sales arm, the Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. The firm subsequently became better known by the latter name. Unlike other pioneers of aviation, who were engaged in developing and testing experimental models, or producing a few planes for rich private customers, White set out from the first to produce aircraft on a commercial scale. The Bristol Boxkite firmly established British and Colonial as a major manufacturer. White was well aware of the importance of publicity, participating in the competitions sponsored by Northcliffe's <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and putting on flying demonstrations for overseas governments and the general public. Flying schools were set up to create a market, and by 1914 nearly half Britain's pilots had been trained on Bristol aircraft. The company went on to play a major role in the war effort. The Bristol Fighter, possibly the best allied aircraft of the First World War, went into production shortly before White's death, and more than 3500 were eventually produced.<br>
<br>Handsome and impeccably dressed, and of an engaging personality, White was widely respected for his business acumen and integrity. He served as president of the Bristol stock exchange for many years. However, his hostility to municipalization of transport utilities and his manipulation of railway shares won him many critics, and he engaged in fierce struggles with the trade unions, insisting that he alone bore responsibility for employees' welfare. Away from business he was a major benefactor of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, the Red Cross, and other charities, and was made a baronet for his public service in 1904. A staunch Conservative, he served as a local councillor and JP but refused to stand for parliament, remarking that a seat on the back benches would be insufficient to interest him. Sir George White died suddenly of a heart attack on 22 November 1916, at his home, Old Sneed Park, Stoke Bishop, Bristol.<br>
