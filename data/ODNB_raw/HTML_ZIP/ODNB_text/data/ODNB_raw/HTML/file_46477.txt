<span class="headword">McKenzie,  Andrew</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gaelus]</span>  (1780&#150;1839), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Dunover, co. Down, the second son of a small farmer. One of a family of six, his parents struggled to raise and educate him. He attended a local school for a brief period, and at the age of fourteen he began an apprenticeship as a linen weaver. He developed a passion for books, not only reading poetry but also composing verses at the loom. At the age of twenty he began to publish his verses in the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, under the pseudonym Gaelus. His contributions were well received: he began to establish a reputation in Belfast literary circles and was acclaimed by his fellow weaver poets as &#145;the Bard of Dunover&#146;.<br>
<br>McKenzie exchanged poetic epistles with Robert Anderson, the Cumberland Bard (1770&#150;1833), who was employed as a calico print designer in Doagh and Carnmoney, co. Antrim, between 1808 and 1818. Anderson, who had himself published <span class="italic">Ballads in the Cumberland Dialect</span> in 1805, encouraged McKenzie to write in Ulster Scots. In 1810 McKenzie published his first collection, <span class="italic">Poems and Songs, on Different Subjects</span>, which attracted more than 2000 subscribers, and was favourably reviewed. It earned him over &pound;200.<br>
<br>McKenzie bought a fishing boat and built a cottage at Dunover, which he called Mount Gaelus. Yet catastrophe followed: the fishing boat was wrecked, and he narrowly escaped drowning; and he was evicted from his cottage, because he had failed to secure a lease. He, his wife, and six children found themselves homeless and destitute. He eventually found employment in Belfast as a seller of religious tracts, but never again enjoyed financial security. Despite his poverty, McKenzie published a second collection in 1832, <span class="italic">The Masonic Chaplet</span>, largely through the support of several lodges of freemasons, of which society he was an enthusiastic member. However, both his health and his fortunes continued to decline. He died in Belfast in extreme poverty on 10 May 1839, and was buried in the Shankill graveyard on 13 May.<br>
<br>McKenzie belongs to the group of Ulster poets known as the rhyming weavers, who wrote in both standard English and vernacular Ulster Scots. His work reveals a tension between his desire for wider literary recognition and his position as a local folk-poet, articulating the hardships, fears, and aspirations of the rural working class. In &#145;Gannaway Burn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Masonic Chaplet</span>, 34&#150;5) he succeeds in combining pastoral idyll with the use of Ulster Scots to evoke the lost rural landscape of his youth.<br>
