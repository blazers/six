<span class="headword">Newburgh,  William  of</span>  (<em>b. </em>1135/6, <em>d.</em> in or after 1198), <span class="occ">Augustinian canon and historian</span>, belonged to a family that may have originated in Bridlington or an area nearby, according to statements in his <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>. He was educated from boyhood in the Augustinian priory of Newburgh, and spent most if not all of his life as a member of that community. The evidence of his chronicle suggests that he died in or soon after 1198. Apart from the <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, which was his major work, William wrote a number of sermons which are found together with his history, and a commentary on the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> begun before 1196, which he interpreted as a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary. An attempt has been made to identify him with a certain William, canon of Newburgh, whose name appears in a charter of the period. Between 1160 and 1165 this William married Emma de Peri, an heiress of considerable lands, and subsequently retired to Newburgh as a canon between 1182 and 1183. The identification seems unlikely, for there is nothing in the <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> to suggest experience of the world outside the cloister. Despite his own accomplishments William came from a house with no tradition of historical writing. He was encouraged in his historical work by Ernald, abbot of Rievaulx (<i>d</i>. 1199), while his commentary on the <span class="roman">Song of Songs</span> was written at the request of another Cistercian, Roger, abbot of Byland (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1199). William's Cistercian contacts were important and were to prove a significant influence upon his writing.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> itself seems to have been composed in a comparatively short period between 1196 and 1198. The work has the appearance of being an early draft which was never revised. The history is divided into five books, and each book into a number of chapters, an indication of William's attempt to structure his narrative, and give it some kind of literary form. After a brief prologue in which he looks back with approval to the work of Gildas and Bede, his first book covers the period from 1066 to 1154. The second book deals with the reign of Henry II from Henry's accession in 1154 to 1174. The third book takes the history from 1175 to Henry's death in 1189, while the final two books cover more limited periods, concluding in 1194 and 1198 respectively. The history is of particular value for its account of the reign of Henry II, and especially for the early years of that reign, which are not well covered by other sources. As the narrative breaks off suddenly in May 1198, it seems likely that William died while still working on this section of his history.<br>
<br>William of Newburgh is a writer whose reputation has remained consistently high among modern readers. Like Ailred (<i>d</i>. 1167), with whose writings he was almost certainly acquainted, William wrote in a good, clear Latin style. He knew something of Latin literature, quoting from Virgil and Horace, and was acquainted with the work of the early church fathers such as Augustine and Gregory. It is, however, the broad range of his narrative, and the critical qualities that he exhibits, that distinguish his work. Although William appears to have spent the whole of his life at Newburgh, he put together a narrative which extended over much of Christendom, and which, as regards England, included an account of the major political events of the century in which he lived. William's interest in northern events is also evident. His chronicle is an important source of information on the Cistercian settlement in the north, the northern archbishops, and the attack on the Jews in York in 1190. In writing his history William used only a few identifiable sources. Among those accounts that can be identified are the chronicles of Symeon of Durham and Henry of Huntingdon (or perhaps their likely source, the Durham compilation known as the <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum post obitum Bedae</span>), which he used for the opening part of his work, the Anglo-Norman poem of Jordan Fantosme, which was used for the events of the 1170s, and the <span class="italic">Itinerarium regis Ricardi</span> of Richard of Devizes, which was a source for the third crusade. A lost biography of Richard I, by the king's chaplain, Anselm, may have been a source for William's account of the king's captivity. Apart from these writings much of his information came from contemporaries. Although he rarely names them, he is careful to indicate whether or not his informants were eyewitnesses of a particular event. Thus he says that his account of the Council of Rheims in 1148, and of Raymond of Antioch on the second crusade, came from people who were there. An eyewitness provided him with information on events in London in 1196. Elsewhere he says that an abbot, an archdeacon, or a monk, related some particular piece of information to him. It seems likely that several of these informants came from William's contacts within the Augustinian order, as well as from neighbouring Cistercian houses which through their founders had close links with the Anglo-Norman aristocracy.<br>
<br>As his work indicates, William possessed historical ability of a high order. Apart from the range of his narrative, and the care with which he indicated his sources, the quality of his writing is also evident in his treatment of some of the major controversies of the twelfth century. His independence of judgement is clearly seen in his account of the quarrel between Henry II and Thomas Becket, in which he considered neither party to be free from blame, criticizing Henry for the manner in which he dealt with the matter of criminous clerks, and Becket for his obstinacy in resisting the king's decree. He wrote from a similar viewpoint when describing the &#145;pointless conflict&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, <span class="italic">Historia</span>, 444) between Canterbury and York. His well-informed, well-balanced, and realistic account of the massacre of the Jews at York in 1190 made no attempt to conceal the atrocities that were committed nor his own condemnation of these acts. Nowhere is William's critical judgement seen to better advantage than in his treatment of Geoffrey of Monmouth's history. William was not misled by Geoffrey's story. In the opening to his work he denounced what he termed its &#145;impudent fabrications&#146; (<i>impudentia mentitur</i>; Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia</span>, 18), and argued that Bede would have mentioned Arthur if that ruler had existed. He pointed out errors in Geoffrey's account, including the presence of kingdoms and archbishops unknown to history. If William displayed a certain partiality in denouncing Geoffrey's work while accepting other fictions, he revealed, at least with regard to Geoffrey's history, a soundness of judgement that was not always found among his successors in the field of historical writing. None the less, despite William's criticism, Geoffrey's history &#145;swept away opposition with the ruthless force of a great epic&#146;  (Kendrick, 7). As William himself divined, the appeal of Geoffrey's history lay not in its truth, but in the fact that it provided the British with a noble and romantic past.<br>
<br>Remarkable as the <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> was as a piece of historical writing, William's work inevitably reflected the intellectual milieu in which it was written. Twelfth-century chroniclers lacked the techniques available to a modern historian: William made some errors of fact, and his chronology was not always accurate. Thus he was six years in arrears in his date for the Council of Oxford of 1166, on which he provides the fullest surviving account. He did, however, attempt to construct as reliable a narrative as possible, and his use of documents, including the texts of papal letters, illustrates his appreciation of the value of such sources. Like Bede he had an interest in the miraculous. In particular he wrote at length about the miracles and marvels that he claimed had been seen in twelfth-century England. Some of his best stories concern the raising of the dead, and have their parallels in Icelandic literature. Among such ghost stories was one given on the authority of Stephen, archdeacon of Buckingham, concerning a dead man who forced his unwelcome attentions upon the living until finally a letter from the saintly Bishop Hugh of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1200), placed upon the dead man's body, ensured a satisfactory end to these activities.<br>
<br>As his association with Abbot Ernald indicates, William's history was from the start intended for an audience wider than that of his own community. The <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> survives in nine copies. One copy (BL, Stowe MS 62) belonged to Newburgh Priory, and may have been written in William's own's lifetime. Not surprisingly his work was especially popular among the Cistercians. Although no surviving manuscript can be assigned to Rievaulx, it is certain that a copy of his work would have been found there, and also at Byland. Copies of his history were in the possession of the Cistercian houses of Rufford and Buildwas, while the Cistercian annals of Stanley in Wiltshire follow an incomplete text of William's work. The <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> was also known within the Augustinian order. The Augustinian abbey of Osney in Oxfordshire owned a thirteenth-century copy, and at the end of that century Walter of Guisborough, an Augustinian canon, used William's account as a main source for his own chronicle. Members of other orders were familiar with the work. In the fourteenth century both the Anonimalle chronicle in its opening section, and Nicholas Trevet in his annals utilized William's account. Judged by the standards of its day the <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span> was a remarkable achievement and the forerunner of what was to become an important tradition of chronicle writing by Augustinian canons in the north of England.<br>
