<span class="headword">Ogle, Sir  Charles</span>, second baronet  (1775&#150;1858), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 24 May 1775 at Worthy Park House, Martyr's Worthy, Hampshire. He was the eldest son of Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, first baronet (1727&#150;1816), and his wife, Hester, daughter of John Thomas, bishop of Winchester, and was the great-nephew of Sir Chaloner Ogle. He attended Hyde Abbey School, Winchester, and entered the navy in 1787 on board the <i>Adventure</i>, with Captain John Nicholson Inglefield. After uneventful service in different ships on the coast of Africa and home stations, he was made lieutenant on the <i>Woolwich</i>, in the West Indies, on 15 November 1793. In January 1794 he was moved into the <i>Boyne</i>, flagship of Sir John Jervis (later first earl of St Vincent), and in May he was appointed acting captain of the <i>Assurance</i>. On 21 May 1794 he was confirmed as commander of the sloop <i>Avenger</i>, from which he was moved to the <i>Petrel</i>, and on 11 January 1796, in the Mediterranean, was posted by Jervis to the <i>Minerve</i>. During the following years, despite St Vincent's concern at his lack of steadiness, he commanded the frigates <i>Meleager</i>, <i>Greyhound</i>, and <i>&Eacute;gyptienne</i>, for the most part in the Mediterranean, coming home in early 1802. On 22 April he married Charlotte Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1814), daughter of General Sir Thomas Gage, brother of Admiral Sir William Gage; they had two daughters and a son, Chaloner, who succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
<br>In 1805 Ogle commanded the frigate <i>Unit&eacute;</i>, and in 1806 was appointed to the yacht <i>Princess Augusta</i>, which he commanded until August 1815, when he took command of the <i>Ramillies</i> in the channel. In November 1815 he commanded the <i>Malta</i> at Plymouth, and in 1816 the <i>Rivoli</i> at Portsmouth. On the death of his father, on 27 August 1816, he succeeded to the baronetcy, and a considerable fortune. This financial security may well explain his limited post-war service. He was promoted rear-admiral on 12 August 1819. On 4 September 1820 he married Letitia (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Sir William Burroughs, bt; they had one son, William, who succeeded as fifth baronet. From 1827 to 1830 Ogle was commander-in-chief in North America, and he became vice-admiral on 22 July 1830. He married, on 10 April 1834, Mary Anne Dalton (<i>d</i>. February 1842), daughter of George Cary of Tor Abbey, Devon, already twice a widow. They had no children. He became admiral on 23 November 1841, and was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth from 1845 to 1848. He was promoted admiral of the fleet on 8 December 1857. He died at Tunbridge Wells on 16 June 1858 and was buried at Ponteland church, Northumberland.<br>
<br>Ogle's two commands were well handled and successful; he was a man of some ability and, through his brother-in-law Gage, close to the tory party. He was a solid professional sea officer who made a significant contribution to naval charities, both in financial support and administrative effort.<br>
