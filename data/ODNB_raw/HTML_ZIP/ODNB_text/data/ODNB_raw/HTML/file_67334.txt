<span class="headword">Jephcott,  (Agnes) Pearl</span>  (1900&#150;1980), <span class="occ">social researcher</span>, was born on 1 May 1900 at Church Street, Alcester, Warwickshire, the youngest of the four children of Edward Arthur Jephcott, auctioneer, and his wife, Agnes Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boobbyer. She attended Alcester grammar school and then the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, where in 1922 she graduated BA in history. She was awarded an MA degree by publication in 1946. After trying various careers (teaching, secretarial work, and fund-raising for Dr Barnardo's homes) Jephcott turned to the girls' club movement and in 1927 was appointed as the organizing secretary of the Birmingham Union of Girls' Clubs. She was a highly effective organizer and in 1935 was appointed as a temporary county organizer for the National Association of Girls' Clubs to develop youth work in the &#145;special areas&#146; of high unemployment in co. Durham.<br>
<br>The war saw Jephcott moving to London as a national organizer for the association, working on developing service cadet companies, to provide opportunities for training and voluntary service for girls. Later she became publications secretary and editor of the association's newsletter, <span class="italic">Club News</span>. She was then granted leave of absence to complete her first major publication, <span class="italic">Girls Growing Up</span> (1942). This was an investigation into the home conditions, work, leisure, and personal relationships of 153 English and Welsh fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds. The following year her textbook for club leaders, <span class="italic">Clubs for Girls</span> (1943), was published. <span class="italic">Girls Growing Up</span> was greeted enthusiastically by professionals and the general public alike, and for the remainder of her life Jephcott pursued a career in social research. The award of a Barnett fellowship enabled her to follow up the girls in her first study, and <span class="italic">Rising Twenty</span> was published in 1948. The two studies indicate the concerns and style of much of Jephcott's subsequent research. All presented vivid, detailed, and at times passionate pictures of little researched aspects of the lives of working-class people, particularly of girls and young women. They involved detailed ethnographic research using participant observation, interviews, and autobiographical accounts, and offered practical recommendations to improve the quality of life of their subjects.<br>
<br>Jephcott worked briefly for Political and Economic Planning, co-authoring three of its broadsheets, and for the northern industrial group, before joining (in 1950) the University of Nottingham, where she managed two projects. The first examined the social origins of delinquency, and the second investigated the membership of youth organizations. The latter resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">Some Young People</span> (1954). In 1954 she was appointed as a senior research assistant at the London School of Economics (LSE) to work in Richard Titmuss's social administration department with Nancy Seear and John Smith, investigating the impact of married women in employment at the large Peek Frean's factory in Bermondsey. While her colleagues undertook the industrial side of the study, Jephcott investigated domestic conditions. The research involved sustained contact with the local community, and characteristically Jephcott lived in, and participated fully in the life of, the local area. The project had a troubled passage, but in 1962 <span class="italic">Married Women Working</span> was published. It joined the growing body of research that tempered popular hysteria against working wives and mothers. Her contributions while at the LSE went beyond her sociological research work. Her extensive youth work experience prompted invitations to sit on two government committees of inquiry: in 1957&#150;8 she was a member of the Central Advisory Council for Education (England) and a contributor to its report, <span class="italic">15&#150;18</span> (1959&#150;60), and in 1958 she joined the Albermarle committee, which laid the foundations for the modern youth service in England and Wales. In addition, she undertook two commissions for the Home Office reporting on the needs of young people in the coastal areas of British Guiana and in the West Indies.<br>
<br>By the early 1960s Jephcott was keen to pursue her own research interests and turned again to the subjects of her early research, who by then were women in their twenties and thirties. She completed a third research project on the women, &#145;The uncertain years&#146;, but the work was never published. After leaving the LSE reluctantly, her next project was the North Kensington family study, in which she investigated housing conditions and race relations in London's Notting Hill area. Her forthright report, <span class="italic">A Troubled Area: Notes on Notting Hill</span> (1964), highlighted how scarce were the resources and support available to &#145;some of the most troubled of London's citizens&#146;. She was next invited to Glasgow University to study the leisure interests of young people in Scotland. The fruits of her research were published in 1967 as <span class="italic">Time of One's Own</span>; by this time she had moved to her next project: studying high-rise living in two Glasgow tower blocks. When published as <span class="italic">Homes in High Flats</span> (1971), the work confirmed popular misgivings about multi-storey homes, especially that they were &#145;nae use for the bairns&#146;. In 1970 she left Glasgow, but this was only semi-retirement. She travelled to Australia and continued to research and write, for example undertaking a study for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) on the situation of children and youth in Hong Kong. In 1973 she gained funding for a two-year, half-time post to research the needs of families living in high-rise flats in Birmingham, and persuaded the local authority to let her live in a council flat. The work resulted in the appointment of a social development fieldworker to work with young families in high flats.<br>
<br>All Jephcott's work was suffused with concern for humanity and particularly for working-class people. From her early work as a youth leader, through her various research posts, she explored their lives with enormous sympathy and no sentimentality. On spring bank holiday 1980 she suffered a stroke. She died, unmarried, at the War Memorial Hospital, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 9 November 1980. After her funeral service at St Mary's Church, Oxford, on 13 November she was cremated in Oxford.<br>
