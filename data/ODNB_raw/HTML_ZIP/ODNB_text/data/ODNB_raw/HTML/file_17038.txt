</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Love,  Christopher</span>  (1618&#150;1651), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, born in Cardiff, Glamorgan, was the youngest son of parents &#145;of the middle sized people, who had neither poverty nor riches&#146;  (DWL, MS 38.34, pp. 278&#150;9). In his youth Love was brought up to play cards in the houses of local gentlemen, but he was converted to evangelical Christianity in 1633 when he heard William Erbury preach.<h2>
<a name="AyoungPuritaine"></a>A &#145;young Puritaine&#146;</h2>Under Erbury's ministry Love became depressed for the &#145;fifteen years of his life past which he had spent in vanity&#146;  (Sloane MS 3945, fol. 81<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). His father, Christopher Love, a merchant, suggested that he play cards with local gentlemen to take his mind off his anxieties, but Love declared that he could no longer &#145;endure to see cards or dice in any hand or house&#146;  (ibid.). This new-found faith caused a rift between Christopher and his father, who complained that his son had changed from having &#145;the name of a young Gaimester&#146; to being known as &#145;a young Puritaine&#146;  (ibid.). In an attempt to stop this new faith Love's father confined his son in the top room of the family house. Yet Christopher, who had an &#145;impatient longing desire to heare the Word&#146;  (ibid.), escaped to church by sliding down a rope attached to the window of the room.<br>
<br>At seventeen Love's father arranged for his son to be apprenticed in London. However, Erbury had coached Love for the ministry and, with the support of his mother, Love convinced his father to let him go up to Oxford. Although poor, Love arrived in Oxford desiring to attend a college where he could share the fellowship of the godly. Love decided to go to New Inn Hall when he heard some students complain that Christopher Rogers, the college's principal, was &#145;an Arch Puritaine&#146;  (Sloane MS 3945, fol. 81<i>v</i>). He matriculated as a servitor in July 1635. Love's poverty at New Inn Hall meant that he worked hard to finish his degree early in order to enter the ministry. While at Oxford he practised the skills that would allow him to follow this calling. Wood relates that he preached in St Peter's Church, &#145;prating for more than an hour before academical as well as lay auditors&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.228).<br>
<br>At New Inn, Love was &#145;looked upon by the generallity as a melancholy [and] sad dejected man&#146;  (Sloane MS 3945, fol. 82), but this was perhaps due as much to dire poverty as to worries about his salvation. Love could not afford to complete his degree and so resolved to go to London to join the godly as a schoolteacher. But Love fortunately benefited from the estate of a gentleman who left money for poor scholars in his will, and he was able to proceed BA on 2 May 1639. However, he refused episcopal ordination, considering it corrupt.<br>
<br>In June 1639 Love became chaplain to the household of John Warner, the newly elected sheriff of London. His role followed a rigorous pattern of puritan spiritual exercise. Every morning he examined the family's knowledge of scripture, and he marked Mondays as a day for catechizing. Saturday afternoon and evening would be spent preparing the family for the sabbath with tests on the catechism and on the previous week's sermon. While in Warner's household Love met his wife, Mary Stone [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74442/', "Love, Mary (fl. 1639&#150;1660)")</script>], an orphaned daughter of Matthew Stone, a wealthy London merchant: they married some six years after they first met. As Warner's chaplain Love was well protected in his nonconformity. In 1640 he was the first clergyman to refuse subscription to the Laudian canons. His notoriety brought him to the notice of William Juxon, the Laudian bishop of London, who used Love's refusal of episcopal ordination as a pretext to suspend him. Prior to his suspension Love received the call of the parish of St Anne and St Agnes within Aldersgate, London. In order to preach again Love needed ordination and so sought to receive holy orders from a presbytery in Scotland. However, the Scots refused Love on the basis that he had no call to a cure of souls in their national church.<br>
<br>On his return from Scotland, Love was invited to preach in Newcastle; he took this opportunity to attack the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and the Laudian ceremonies, an act that earned him a spell in prison. He was removed to London on a writ of habeas corpus but was acquitted after trial at king's bench. Despite his suspension, Love appears to have been something of a wandering firebrand: on 26 March 1642 he proceeded MA but was also expelled from the University of Oxford for his nonconformity. Later that year he preached a sermon at Tenterden in Kent on the lawfulness of a defensive war against the king. This brought a charge of treason, but Love was again acquitted. In Autumn 1642 Love and George Lawrence, a fellow New Inn Hall student, published <span class="italic">The Debauched Cavaleer, or, The English Midianite</span>. This tract compared royalists to the biblical enemies of Israel and advised parliament to prepare for a bloody war.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarpreacher"></a>Civil war preacher</h2>Love's talents as a parliamentarian preacher did not go unrecognized and in late 1642 he was appointed chaplain to the regiment of the parliamentarian MP John Venn, later governor of Windsor Castle. While at Windsor, Love excelled as a chaplain, catechizing soldiers and, when plague broke out, caring for the sick and dying. He also earned the respect of Sir Thomas Fairfax by preaching a sermon on the sixtieth psalm, comparing the parliamentarian forces to the army of biblical Israel. On 23 January 1645 Love finally received presbyterian ordination when the House of Lords empowered the Westminster assembly to form an <i>ad hoc</i> presbytery to ordain clergymen. Love's ordination took place at St Mary Aldermanbury, London, under a presbytery presided over by Thomas Horton.<br>
<br>During the peace talks between parliament and the royalists at Uxbridge, Love was invited to preach the market day sermon in that town. His sermon, <span class="italic">England's Distemper Having Division and Error as its Cause</span>, preached on 30 January 1645, was a warning to parliament not to appease the crimes of the cavaliers in order to obtain peace. Love counselled the parliament not to &#145;doate &hellip; too much on this Treaty of Peace&#146; because the royalists &#145;lye under the guilt of much innocent blood, and are not meet persons to be at peace with, till all the guilt of blood be expiated and avenged, either by the sword of Law, or law of the Sword&#146;  (C. Love, <span class="italic">England's Distemper</span>, 1645, 42, 37). Love's sermon caused immediate scandal and the royalist newspaper <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span> falsely reported that he preached that the king himself was to be punished as a man of blood. This led the royalist commissioners at Uxbridge to lodge a complaint; on 3 February the House of Commons ordered that Love be put into safe custody pending investigation. Love's arrest, however, seems to have been merely to appease royalists; he was confined to his garrison at Windsor and on 5 March, after the Uxbridge negotiations collapsed, the Commons ordered that his confinement be lifted.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1646 Love was chosen to preach the afternoon fast sermon to the House of Commons. He used his sermon to advise Fairfax and parliament to purge the army of heretics, preaching that &#145;the requittal of men for their good service, must not extend so farre as to tolerate them in their evils&#146;  (C. Love, <span class="italic">Short and Plaine Animadversions</span>, 1646, sig. A2<i>v</i>.). Love also caused some scandal when he broke both ministerial and parliamentary protocols by disputing with William Dell on the floor of the Commons. Dell, an antiformalist who opposed all fixed church structures, had used the morning fast sermon to preach against a presbyterian reformation of the Church of England. When Dell published his sermon without the consent of the Commons, he added criticisms of Love's principles as an appendix. Love was forced to reply with some <span class="italic">Short and Plaine Animadversions</span>, arguing that a presbyterian national church was the divinely warranted prescription for &#145;peace, union, and brotherly love&#146; in a Christian commonwealth  (ibid., 25). Love argued that the purpose of formal church government was to win souls to Jesus Christ, to nurture them in their growth, and to protect them from soul-damning errors. In defence of church discipline Love cited <span class="roman">Jude</span> 23: &#145;others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh&#146;  (ibid., 12).<h2>
<a name="Presbyterianminister"></a>Presbyterian minister</h2>Although Love had been nominated by parliament to become the preacher at Newcastle, in May 1645 he was re-elected to the parish of St Anne and St Agnes within Aldersgate and so left the service of Venn's regiment to take up the cure of souls. In London, Love joined with the other ministers who were constructing a presbyterian church government in the City. From 1646 the London ministers increasingly believed that heretics in the army were the greatest threat to presbyterianism and so became vocal critics of the army's activities. Love appears to have been a central figure in this attack. In May 1647 Colonel John Lambert's regiment petitioned the council of officers at Saffron Walden, complaining that &#145;the ministers in their public labour &hellip; do make us odious to the kingdom &hellip; [and] have printed many scandalous books against us, as Mr Edwards's <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> and Mr. Love's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>&#146;  (Woodhouse, 399).<br>
<br>The fruit of Love's sermons appeared in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Works of Darkness Brought to Light</span>. In this tract, published in July 1647 under the pseudonym Tom Tell-Troth, Love accused the army of rigging elections, of desiring to abolish the House of Lords, and of having designs on the life of the king. He declared:<blockquote>O Ye Inhabitants of ENGLAND &hellip; Wil ye suffer the Army under pretence of justice to bring you under oppression, and under the notion of Liberty to bring you into bondage, and under the name of the Saints of Light to act the part of Angels of darkness? (Love, <span class="italic">Works of Darkness</span>, 7)</blockquote>Like many presbyterian ministers, Love opposed the call for religious toleration on the grounds that it would encourage religious libertinism and lead to social turbulence. Instead of tolerating error, Love counselled his flock not to get lost in trivial doctrinal speculation but to &#145;let it be your endeavour to get Christ's kingdom to be erected in your hearts&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">Heaven's Glory</span>, 76). The volumes of posthumously published sermons show that Love was an able preacher whose method was to apply Calvinist doctrine to both comfort and humble his flock before God.<br>
<br>In March 1649 the vestry of St Lawrence Jewry, London, offered to make Love its minister. In return for his stipend Love was asked to preach twice on the sabbath and once on fast days. Love followed the policy of his fellow presbyterian ministers by insisting that parishioners were conversant with the fundamentals of Reformed Christianity before they attended holy communion. This policy resulted from the presbyterians' insistence that communicants should be able to examine their consciences in line with St Paul's instructions in <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 11: 26&#150;34. Upon election to St Lawrence Jewry, Love was asked &#145;To admit all of his parish to that table that desire it, and are not knowne to be either grosly scandalous, or notoriously &hellip; of ill and scandalous life&#146;. Despite this request, the figures for the purchase of communion wine in the churchwardens' accounts suggest that Love admitted no more communicants to the Lord's supper than his presbyterian predecessor Anthony Burges.<br>
<br>With the army's purge of parliament on 6 December 1648 and the trial of Charles I, Love joined his fellow presbyterian ministers in condemning the army's political <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. Between 28 December 1648 and 20 February 1649 Love joined the London presbyterians in holding private prayer meetings designed to &#145;find out some way to disappoint &hellip; [the regicides'] bloody intentions&#146;  (DWL, MS PP.12.50*.4 (21), fol. 85). Love was also a signatory to the printed letters published by the London presbyterian ministers in January 1649 protesting against the regicide and revolution.<br>
<br>After the regicide Love declared that he was &#145;a friend to a regulated Monarchy, a free Parliament, an obedient Army, and a Godly ministry; but an enemy to Tyranny, Malignity, Anarchy and Heresie&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">A Modest and Clear Vindication</span>, frontispiece). He accused the army of political cynicism and selfish factionalism. At the same time he attempted to counter allegations that the presbyterians had converted to royalist principles. Love declared that although the presbyterians were &#145;zealous Anti-Cavalierists&#146; they were not &#145;Anti-Carolists&#146;. Likewise, the presbyterians were &#145;for the Army while they used the sword to subdue malignants in arms; but against them when they use the sword to cut off the King and force the Parliament&#146;.<br>
<br>Love was at the forefront of the presbyterians who attacked the republic. He opposed the engagement of loyalty and preached against the millenarian fantasies of the republican &#145;saints&#146;. On 29 July 1649 he told his flock: &#145;This is not the way to usher in Jesus Christ; to cut off Protestant kings, destroy lawes, government and rule, this is not the fruit of saintshipp&#146;  (DWL, MS PP.12.50*.4 (21), fol. 88). Because of his opposition to the republic, Love was soon in trouble with the new regime. On 6 September 1649 he appeared before the parliamentary committee for plundered ministers charged with seditious preaching but was acquitted when witnesses failed to show. A newspaper reported that &#145;a great company of people&#146; gathered to meet him after his acquittal, crying out &#145;Not a persecutor durst appear against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Weekly Account</span>, 5&#150;13 Sept 1649, 596).<h2>
<a name="Conspiracyandexecution"></a>Conspiracy and execution</h2>In summer 1649 Love became involved in a plot to assist the Scottish covenanters to bring the exiled Charles II to the throne of England. The ringleader of the plot was William Drake, a mercer, who was in contact with presbyterian leaders at the exiled royal court. Drake convinced Love to convene meetings at his house, and some of the most committed presbyterian ministers and laity were invited to attend. The purpose of these meetings, which continued until April 1651, was to hear letters detailing the efforts of the Scottish covenanters and their allies to restore the Stuart monarchy. The exiled royalists hoped that the presbyterian ministers would use their influence with London's merchants to fund a Scottish invasion of England. Despite these plans, Love and his fellows continually refused to send money; Love wrote to Major-General Edward Massey, telling him that &#145;it was neither safe, nor fit for us to ingage in a business of that nature&#146; (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.118; <span class="italic">Mr. Love's Case</span>, 12).<br>
<br>The plot was discovered by the republican regime when Thomas Coke, a royalist agent, was arrested in March 1651. His long depositions led the government to Love and the presbyterian conspirators and on 2 May 1651 Love was arrested on suspicion of treason. Love's trial for treason took place in late June and early July 1651; unsurprisingly, he was found guilty and condemned on 5 July. Although Love was technically guilty, it is clear that the trial was little more than a demonstration of the republic's brute power dressed up as legal sovereignty. This point is graphically exemplified by Sir Henry Vane, who told Cromwell that Love should be executed because the presbyterians &#145;do not judge us a lawful magistracy, nor esteem anything treason that is acted by them to destroy us, in order to bring in the king of Scots as the head of the Covenant&#146;  (B. Worden, <span class="italic">The Rump Parliament</span>, 1974, 244).<br>
<br>Love himself admitted to the high court that he desired an &#145;agreement between the king and Scots&#146; and was unrepentant for his actions. After sentence he told his wife:<blockquote>I bless my God that, notwithstanding all that is come upon me, I have not forsaken Him, nor dealt falsely in his Covenant, and therefore &hellip; never had I more joy in my spirit &hellip; than when the sentence of death was this day read against me. (DWL, MS PP.12.50*.4 (21), fols. 115&#150;16)</blockquote>A campaign was organized by Love's wife and friends to get his condemnation overturned. Many petitions were submitted to parliament for Love's release. However, the pleas for Love's life were to no avail. Although on 15 July Love earned a month's reprieve, it appears that ardent republican Independents were set on Love's destruction. In a last, desperate attempt to save her husband's life, Mary Love sent a petition to Cromwell in Scotland. It arrived on 29 July, and the council of war debated whether to intervene in the affair. Colonels Goffe and Okey were &#145;tooth and nayle&#146; for Love, but colonels Pride and Lambert spoke &#145;high against&#146; a pardon. In the end the council advised Cromwell that he &#145;should not at all ingage or write in the businesse for him&#146;  (F. M. S. Henderson, &#145;New material from the Clarke manuscripts: political and official correspondence and news sent and received by the army headquarters in Scotland, 1651&#150;1660&#146;, DPhil diss., University of Oxford, 1998, 80).<br>
<br>The last petition for Love's pardon was rejected on 18 August and he learned that on 22 August 1651 he would die by beheading on Tower Hill. With his death imminent, the London presbyterian ministers spent the days preparing Love for martyrdom. On the morning of his execution Love told his friend James Lever that he &#145;blessed God [that] his heart did not soe much as leape or pant in his breast, but hee was as cheerfull as hee were to live till the Day of Judgement&#146;  (A. Wallis, &#145;The diary of a London citizen in the seventeenth century&#146;, <span class="italic">The Reliquary</span>, new ser., vol. 3, 1889, 89). His wife relates that the grim procession to the scaffold &#145;made the hill ring with [the] bitter-weeping and lamentations&#146; of the crowd gathered to witness his death  (DWL, MS PP.12.50*.4 (21), fol. 137).<br>
<br>In a long execution speech Love declared himself to be &#145;a Spectacle unto God, Angels and men, &hellip; a Grief to the Godly; a Laughing stock to the wicked and a Gazing stock to all&#146;. He declared that &#145;I desire this day to magnifie God &hellip; that such a one as I, born in an obscure Country in Wales &hellip; that God should look upon me, and &hellip; single me out to be an Object of his everlasting Love&#146;. However, he warned the republic that &#145;my blood will be bad food for this Infant Commonwealth &hellip; Mine is not malignant blood, though here I am brought a grievous and notorious Offender&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mr. Love's Case</span>, 25&#150;6).<br>
<br>Love's body was privately buried at his parish church, St Lawrence Jewry, three days later. After his death his executors, including the London presbyterian ministers Edmund Calamy, Simeon Ashe, William Taylor, and Matthew Poole, published fifteen volumes of Love's sermons. The thought behind this endeavour, they claimed, was not &#145;to make old sores bleed&#146; but to mourn the &#145;great loss the Church of God had in the death of so useful and hopeful a minister&#146;. Thirteen days after Love's execution his widow, Mary, gave birth prematurely to the fifth of their children. Mary Love later wrote a manuscript biography of her husband.<br>
<br>By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Love had gained a further reputation. In a host of cheap pamphlets in both Britain and America, sometimes laced with versions of last letters to his wife or his scaffold speech to lend verisimilitude and the authority of a martyr, Love was reinvented as a prophet of the last days. He had foretold the Restoration, the plague of 1665, and the great fire of London. From his studies of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span> he had predicted the American War of Independence and the French Revolution, the last &#145;the destruction of popery, or Babylon's fall&#146;, &#145;the revolution in France, which is properly Babylon's fall, as it hath broken off the tenth horn of the beast, so that the Pope hath become as weak as another man&#146; (<span class="italic">The Strange and Wonderful Predictions of Mr Christopher Love</span>, n. d., 8; <span class="italic">Prophecies of the Reverend Christopher Love: and his Last Words</span>, 1794, 7).<br>
