<span class="headword">Buckland <span class="st"> [Bocland]</span>,  Geoffrey  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1225), <span class="occ">justice and administrator</span>, was, like many contemporary government officials, a close associate of Hubert Walter. He witnessed several of Hubert's deeds and they appeared together in final concords, for example at Oxford in November 1195, St Benet of Hulme in April 1197, and Shrewsbury in January 1198. Final concords likewise record his activities as a justice, for example at Dunwich in July 1201, at the Tower of London in August 1202, and at Westminster in August 1204. He was also an itinerant justice in the east of England in 1194, and in the south under Geoffrey fitz Peter in 1202. However, and again like many Angevin administrators, Buckland did not exercise his talents in any one field. He devoted considerable time to the exchequer. When Robert de Berni&egrave;res had his farm for Ormesby in Norfolk reduced in 1199 it was through Buckland that the justiciar passed this information to the exchequer barons. The pipe roll of 1203 mentions a roll of fines which Geoffrey of Buckland entered into the treasury, and he may at times have acted as the justiciar's deputy at the exchequer. An account of a lengthy dispute between the monasteries of Crowland and Spalding also reveals his prominence, reporting that when judgment was given in 1202 he was one of many &#145;nobles&#146; who were at court for the business of the realm.<br>
<br>Buckland's importance at this time clearly stemmed in part from his close relationship with the justiciar, Geoffrey fitz Peter, whose sister-in-law had married William of Buckland, probably Geoffrey's elder brother. Indeed on one occasion after the justiciar's death a chancery clerk mistakenly described the two Geoffreys as brothers, when ordering Geoffrey of Buckland to sell to the king the corn and stock of Geoffrey fitz Peter's estate at Berkhamsted. Buckland witnessed several of the justiciar's writs, including the earliest surviving returned writ of novel disseisin, and various of Geoffrey fitz Peter's charters recording gifts to the church, for example the foundation of Shouldham Priory in Norfolk, which Buckland attended together with Hubert Walter.<br>
<br>Buckland's ecclesiastical career had begun by 24 September 1198 when he was archdeacon of Norwich, a post he may have held until about 1203. He received the churches of Teynham and Pagham in 1205 and 1206 respectively, and by 1210 he had been made dean of St Martin's-le-Grand. A dispute of the early 1220s shows him in conflict with the canons of St Martin's-le-Grand over the vicarage of Witham, while in 1224 a claim was made against him by the archdeacon of Colchester for Newport, an important portion of the deanery, and he obtained a writ of prohibition against the archdeacon. Buckland appears to have been less prominent in royal administration after <i>c</i>.1203&#150;4, but late in John's reign the king entrusted him with the custody of Aylesbury. However, he became involved in the baronial revolt, and although he received letters of safe conduct to appear before the king, in 1216 his manor of Datchworth in Hertfordshire was forfeited and granted to Nicholas of Yealand. He returned to favour with the accession of Henry III and was still serving the king in 1224. He appears to have become a baron of the exchequer, and was an itinerant justice in eastern England 1218&#150;21. He died between 31 August and 14 September 1225.<br>
