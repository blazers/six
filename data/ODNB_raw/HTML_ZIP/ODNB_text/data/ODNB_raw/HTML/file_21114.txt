<span class="headword">Paget,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">Reformed minister in the Netherlands</span>, was apparently descended from the Paget family of Rothley, Leicestershire; his parents' names are unknown. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1595 and proceeding MA in 1598. From earliest years he sensed an inner call and &#145;ardent affection&#146; to be a preacher  (J. Paget, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Unjust Complaints</span>, 1635, 16). He served as rector of Nantwich from 1598 to 1604, but was ejected for nonconformity. In 1605 he went into exile in the Netherlands and for two years was a chaplain with English troops, under the commands of Sir John Ogle and Sir Horace Vere.<br>
<br>In 1607 Paget moved to Amsterdam to become founding pastor of the English Reformed church, which ministered to English and Scottish residents of the city. Supported by the city magistrates, the church was the English-language wing of the Dutch Reformed church. Paget's inaugural sermon, on 5 February 1607, was on the text &#145;Create in me a clean heart, O God&#146;  (<span class="roman">Psalm 51</span>: 10); these words are to this day inscribed on the walls of the church sanctuary. He was formally established in office on 29 April 1607. Paget held this position for thirty years, often with a co-pastor, and became emeritus in 1637.<br>
<br>Under Paget's leadership, the English church took a strong puritan, presbyterian stand. He refused any use of the English prayer book or Anglican ceremonialism; rather, he joined the Amsterdam classis of the Dutch church and thoroughly approved of the Dutch Reformed way of religion, which he considered compatible with his own presbyterian sentiments. The presbyterian system, he said, is &#145;appointed by God&#146;  (J. Paget, <span class="italic">A Defence of Church Government</span>, 1641, 2.29). Under Paget's leadership, the church grew in membership. Amsterdam had several other English churches composed of separatists and Anabaptists, but Paget always opposed these sectarian factions. He preached and wrote against them and had success in winning a few of the dissidents to his own church. His was the respectable, &#145;English Orthodoxicall church&#146;  (membership registers, nos. 85, 86) in comparison to the separatist, schismatic groups.<br>
<br>In the 1630s, having somewhat quieted the separatists and Anabaptists, Paget had trouble within his own flock, from members who wanted more lively, powerful preaching and discipline. The agitators favoured a newer kind of puritanism, the emerging non-separatist congregationalism (based on teachings of William Ames and Henry Jacob), and they tried to bring in as co-pastors of the church first Thomas Hooker (1631) and then John Davenport (1634), who had gone to the Netherlands as exiles. Paget labelled this new puritanism as a dangerous semi-separatism. Although he finally withstood Hooker and Davenport and sent them on elsewhere, Paget was troubled for several years with controversy with fellow puritans about the role of baptism, the authority of synods, and the degree of congregational autonomy. These troubles spilled over into the English synod of the Netherlands, headed by John Forbes of Delft. Paget refused to join, fearing its radical tendencies.<br>
<br>Through his well-publicized debates and books, Paget became famous as a champion of the Reformed, presbyterian religion. He was author of five books. Most important were <span class="italic">An Arrow Against the Separation</span> (1618), in opposition to Henry Ainsworth, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Unjust Complaints</span> (1635), against William Best and John Davenport, and finally, <span class="italic">A defence of church-government, exercised in presbyteriall, classical, &amp; synodall assemblies</span> (posthumously published in 1641). Through his books and church work, from his Amsterdam location, he became one of the chief defenders of the presbyterian version of puritanism.<br>
<br>In addition to his dogmatic writings, Paget was active in the intellectual life of Amsterdam, being a part of a learned circle of puritans in exile (composed of Paget, Henry Ainsworth, Hugh Broughton, and Matthew Slade), who studied languages and Jewish history. He worked at Hebrew and Arabic and, according to his nephew Robert Paget, he could use the &#145;Chaldean, Syriack, Rabbinicall, Thalmadicall, Arabick, and Persian&#146; versions and commentaries &#145;with much ease&#146;. However, he was hesitant to allow such knowledge into his religious faith. He had a debate with Henry Ainsworth in 1618 about how far to go in appreciation of Hebrew language and learning, with Paget on the conservative, cautious side.<br>
<br>John Paget married Briget Masterson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68076/', "Paget, Briget (b. 1570, d. in or after 1647)")</script>] of Nantwich at an unknown date. They were prosperous; they had investments in the West India Company and owned two houses. They had no children, but they took in their nephew, Robert Paget (<i>d</i>. 1683), supporting his education at Leiden University and making him a beneficiary in their will. He became pastor of the English church at Dort. John Paget died on 18 August 1638 from weakness, colic, and catarrh. His wife lived until at least 1647, when she sold their two houses.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_21119"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Paget</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1660), John's younger brother, was also educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a sizar in 1605, graduating BA in 1608, and proceeding MA in 1612. After being driven from his position at Blackley, Lancashire, because of nonconformity, he too, from 1639 to 1646, served the English church at Amsterdam. On returning to England in 1646, he served at Shrewsbury until 1656, and then was rector of Stockport, Cheshire, until his death in 1660. All the Pagets, John, Thomas, and Robert, were strong presbyterians.<br>
