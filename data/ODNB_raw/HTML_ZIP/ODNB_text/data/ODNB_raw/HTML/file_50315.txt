<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ellis,  William Webb</span>  (1806&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and supposed originator of rugby</span>, was born in Salford, Lancashire, on 24 November 1806, the younger of two sons of James Ellis (<i>d</i>. 1812), soldier, who had married Ann Webb at St Peter's, Exeter, in 1804. He was baptized at Holy Trinity, Salford, on 2 Jan 1807. His father, an ensign in the 1st dragoon guards, served in Ireland in 1807, moved to the regimental depot in Manchester in 1808, then proceeded to the Peninsular War in 1809. On 14 September 1809 he bought a commission in the 3rd dragoon guards for &pound;735. He died in Albuera on 1 July 1812.<br>
<br>William Webb Ellis himself would probably have been forgotten were it not for the claim that, in 1823, &#145;with a fine disregard for the rules of football as played in his time [he] first took the ball in his arms and ran with it&#146;. A stone, which was set in a wall at Rugby School in February 1900, thus commemorates this act. It is because of this supposed action that any details of Ellis's life are known.<br>
<br>Ellis was at Rugby School from 1816 to 1825. All the indications are that, if not unpopular, he was at least an &#145;outsider&#146;. He was a &#145;town-boy&#146; and a foundationer and, as such, received free education at Rugby, his mother having been left &#145;totally unprovided for&#146; by his father's death. She applied for a pension and was granted &pound;10 for each child. His father did not attain any great rank and was of limited means. The purchase of his commission probably used up most of his capital. The fathers of most of the boys at Rugby in Ellis's time were members of the clergy, gentry, and aristocracy. It seems highly improbable that they would have been influenced by the actions of a social inferior, either on the football field or elsewhere.<br>
<br>On leaving school, aged eighteen, Ellis was admitted at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1825, his expenses being partly met by scholarships and, from 1828, a Hulme exhibition. He won a cricket &#145;blue&#146;&#151;although this term was not used then&#151;in 1827, batting number 3 against Cambridge and scoring 12 runs. He also, &#145;in the best traditions of Rugby football&#146;, wrote a poem on beer (&#145;Brasenose Ale&#146;, 1828), although no copies of this appear to have survived. He graduated BA in 1829 and proceeded MA in 1831. After leaving Oxford, he entered the church, and was minister of St George's, Albemarle Street, London, from 1836 until 1855. From 1843 to 1855 he was also rector of St Clement Danes, where the Royal Air Force Rugby Football Union later erected a tablet to his memory. During the last seventeen years of his life he was rector of Laver Magdalen (now Magdalen Laver) in Essex. He never married.<br>
<br>The only known portrait of Ellis is a daguerreotype published in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (24, 1854, 400) following a sermon he preached during the Crimean War. He had established something of a reputation for himself in London as an evangelical clergyman, bolstered by such publications as <span class="italic">A Concise View of Prophecy which Relates to the Messiah</span> (1832), <span class="italic">Sermons at St. George's</span> (1838), and <span class="italic">Dangerous Errors of Romanism</span> (1853), and he was classified in 1844 as one of the low-church clergy in London who &#145;abhor[red] the Tractarian heresy&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add C.290, fol. 17). This reputation probably explains the interest taken in his Crimean War sermon.<br>
<br>Ellis apparently lived a comfortable life and on his death at Menton, Alpes Maritimes, France, on 24 January 1872, left &pound;9000, subsequently divided among a variety of charitable causes, including the Society for the Rescue of Young Women and Children. The residue went to the widow of his brother Thomas. Little was known about his death until October 1959, when his grave was traced to a cemetery in Menton. The French rugby union, apparently delighted that the &#145;founder&#146; of the game was buried in France, renovated the grave, at le cimeti&egrave;re du vieux ch&acirc;teau at Menton, which was visited by their president, the French captain, and a brass band.<br>
<br>Many people argue that the story of Ellis's act in 1823 is a myth, although Macrory, in 1991, remained convinced that Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it. However, it hardly matters whether he did or not, for this practice was not immediately adopted in 1823 but was gradually institutionalized over the following thirty years. Furthermore, it was also in the second quarter of the nineteenth century that rugby acquired such distinctive features as an oval ball, H-shaped goals, scoring above the cross bar, and points for &#145;tries&#146; as well as &#145;goals&#146;. Thus, in focusing solely on the development of carrying, the Ellis story fails to explain all aspects of the emerging uniqueness of the game.<br>
<br>Significantly, Ellis was never interviewed about his claimed role in the development of rugby football and died in 1872 apparently unaware of his &#145;fame&#146;. The story was first advanced in 1876 by the antiquarian Matthew Holbeche Bloxam, who was responding to a series of letters in the London <span class="italic">Standard</span> newspaper by Old Rugbeians reminiscing about their game, which was gaining in popularity at the time. One correspondent had suggested that the Rugby game was simply a refinement of the ancient game of English football, seemingly implying&#151;correctly&#151;that the transition from traditional folk-football had been a gradual development over the years and not the reaction to a particular revolutionary event. Bloxam objected to this version of events, claiming that the distinctive Rugby game was not played at the school when he was there from 1813 to 1821. Shortly afterwards, in a letter to the Rugby School magazine, <span class="italic">Meteor</span>  (10 Oct 1876, 528), Bloxam &#145;ascertained&#146; that &#145;in the second half of 1824&#146; Ellis had caught the ball and run with it. In 1880 Bloxam, again writing in <span class="italic">Meteor</span>  (22 Dec 1880, 155&#150;6), but this time responding to a recent leader in <span class="italic">The Times</span> about differences between the rules of the rugby union and association football games, changed this date to 1823 and provided further biographical information about Ellis which helped consolidate the story. Nevertheless, the supposed contribution of William Webb Ellis to rugby football remained little known outside Rugby School and indeed a history of football, co-written by J. E. Vincent and Montague Shearman in 1885, made no mention of him, and nor did Shearman's book in the popular <span class="roman">Badminton Library</span> series <span class="italic">Athletics and Football</span> (1889) or Frank Marshall's book <span class="italic">Football: the Rugby Union Game</span> (1892).<br>
<br>Bloxam's account would probably have faded into obscurity but for circumstances affecting the game's development in the 1890s. By then, rugby union had spread to northern England and begun to emerge as a commercial spectacle, with players and spectators drawn principally from the working class. This process was conducive to conflict and led, in 1895, to a split between the Rugby Football Union and the Northern Union, which later became the Rugby League. The year 1895 also saw the appointment of a subcommittee of the Old Rugbeian Society to inquire into the origins of the game. It published its report in 1897 and accredited the emergence of a distinctive game to William Webb Ellis, resurrecting Bloxam's account as supporting &#145;evidence&#146;. Revealingly, the commemorative stone was ordered from a local stonemason before all the evidence had been gathered in or the report completed. By giving pride of place in their report to the Ellis story, which correctly located the beginnings of rugby football in their school, the Old Rugbeians were attempting, it has been suggested, to reassert their proprietorship of the rugby game at a time when it was escaping their control and changing in ways of which they disapproved. As Baker put it: &#145;The mythological explanation of the origins of Rugby football provides historians with a valuable clue to the mind and spirit of late-Victorian England, not to the early nineteenth century beginnings of the game. The two should not be confused&#146;  (Baker, 130).<br>
