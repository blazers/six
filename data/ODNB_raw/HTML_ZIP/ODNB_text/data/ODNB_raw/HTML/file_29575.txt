<span class="headword">Willibald</span> <span class="st"> [St Willibald]</span>  (<em>c.</em>700&#150;787?), <span class="occ">bishop of Eichst&auml;tt</span>, was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49421/', "Winnebald")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28427/', "Walburg")</script> and was born <i>c</i>.700 in Wessex. The names of the parents are unknown, though twelfth-century tradition gives the Norman &#145;Richard&#146; as the name of Willibald's father. At the age of five Willibald was entrusted to Abbot Ecgwald at the monastery of Bishop's Waltham, near Winchester. Here he took the tonsure and continued his education in theology and Latin until, aged about twenty, he decided to go on pilgrimage to Rome, a &#145;peregrinatio pro amore Dei&#146; of the type espoused by Celtic religious. Willibald prevailed upon his brother Winnebald and his father to accompany him, setting off in 720. The father fell ill and died at Lucca; the brothers continued the journey to Rome. After surviving a bout of plague, Willibald left his sickly brother in Rome and departed in 723 for the Holy Land. The journey was long and difficult; in Syria Willibald and his companions were imprisoned by a Muslim governor on suspicion of spying and only released by order of the caliph of Baghdad who respected their religious intentions.<br>
<br>Willibald arrived in Jerusalem in the summer of 724 and spent several years visiting the places associated with the life of Christ, literally walking in Christ's footsteps. His account of these years contains surprisingly little anthropological or historical information, but it is a valuable source for contemporary pilgrim routes and the eighth-century archaeology of the sacred sites. After his final visit to Jerusalem Willibald narrowly escaped arrest by the citizens of Tyre on suspicion of smuggling balsam; the ruse by which he escaped detection is admiringly recounted. Willibald proceeded to Constantinople in 727, about which he says little. He arrived there in the midst of iconoclasm and, perhaps in consequence, did not remain long. In 729 he returned to Italy, to Monte Cassino, the cradle of Western monasticism, where he was admitted as a monk under Abbot Petronax. He rose rapidly through the order in the ten years he spent there. In 739 he had an audience with Pope Gregory III, to whom he related the story of his travels in the Holy Land. The pope dispatched him, at Boniface's request, to Germany, to join his brother Winnebald in the missionary field.<br>
<br>Christians had been in Bavaria for a century, but the itinerant nature of the Irish mission had left no institutional structures in place and apostasy was rife. Willibald was ordained by Boniface on his arrival in Germany in 740. He subsequently travelled to Thuringia where he was reunited with Winnebald and was raised to the episcopate in 741. It seems likely that Boniface intended to appoint Willibald to the see at Erfurt, but the new bishop did not remain there. A local landowner in Eichst&auml;tt, Suidgar, had promised land to the church and Willibald returned to Bavaria to found a monastery, putting into practice the Benedictine rule he had observed at Monte Cassino. By 762 he is recorded as &#145;episcopus de monasterio&#146; of Eichst&auml;tt.<br>
<br>Willibald facilitated Winnebald's return to Bavaria to found the monastery at Heidenheim and was present at his brother's deathbed there in 761. In 778 Willibald dictated the story of his youth and travels to the nun Hugeburc at the Heidenheim foundation, now ruled by his sister, Walburg. Hugeburc incorporated Willibald's account into her so-called <span class="italic">Hodoeporicon</span>, the primary source of information about Willibald's life. Willibald died at Eichst&auml;tt on 7 July, probably in 787. He was buried there and was honoured as the founder of the see. The activities of Willibald and his siblings in southern Germany strikingly exemplify the intersection of kinship and spiritual &#145;familia&#146; upon which the success of the Anglo-Saxon mission on the continent depended. In his lifetime Willibald witnessed the rise of Islam and the East&#150;West schism, &#145;not as a mere observer, but &hellip; as a participant&#146;  (Bauch, 17).<br>
