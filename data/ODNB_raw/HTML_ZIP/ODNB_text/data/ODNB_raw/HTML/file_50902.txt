<span class="headword">Finn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McCaul]</span>,  Elizabeth Ann</span>  (1825&#150;1921), <span class="occ">author and supporter of Jewish settlement in Palestine</span>, was born on 14 March 1825 in Warsaw, the eldest child of the Hebrew scholar the Revd Alexander McCaul (1799&#150;1863). Her father, a Christian missionary to the Polish Jews, was ordained and married in England in 1823 and then spent a further eight years in Poland. In 1831 the family moved to London, where he devoted himself to making the condition of the Jewish people known in England; in 1841 he became professor of Hebrew and rabbinical literature at King's College, London.<br>
<br>Elizabeth McCaul was educated by her mother and taught Hebrew by her father, and exhibited a flair for languages. At twelve she taught Hebrew and translated German works for publication. She grew to be a slender woman with a broad brow and strong, regular features. From 1841 James Finn (1806&#150;1872), an Arabic and Hebrew scholar, was a regular visitor to the McCauls. In November 1845 he was appointed British consul for Jerusalem; he and Elizabeth married on 2 January 1846, and set out for Palestine.<br>
<br>Both the Finns, but particularly Elizabeth, saw it as their chief mission to encourage Jewish residence in Palestine under British protection, and to explain the Jews and Palestine to a Christian audience. James Finn, courageous but intolerant and single-minded, made many enemies because of his strongly held opinions. Mrs Finn took great interest in the often turbulent life of Jerusalem and of its small Jewish population. In the early years she accompanied her husband through the Levant and &#145;as far eastward as any English people chose to go&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 61). Each year they spent eventful summer months (with their three children) in camps in the wild, barren lands of Palestine.<br>
<br>In 1913 Elizabeth Finn dictated her reminiscences, which give a panorama of the comings and goings of great and small in and around Jerusalem, and reveal the drama, history, and gossip of the period. Running through all the work is her concern for impoverished Jews: she set up on her landholding a workshop which eventually employed 150 women, and trained Jewish artisans. In 1855 she started writing the semi-fictional <span class="italic">Home in the Holy Land</span> (1866), which was followed by a sequel, <span class="italic">A Third Year in Jerusalem</span> (1869), about the life of Europeans living there. In these works she lucidly described the events of everyday life: the visits of pilgrims, the Christian disputes, the bazaars, Jewish weddings, Muslim funerals, and the social life of the consulate.<br>
<br>In 1863 James Finn was, somewhat ignominiously, replaced as consul; the family returned, saddened and in debt, to England, and settled after a few years in west London. After her husband died in 1872, Mrs Finn threw herself into new activities. She edited his unfinished work, a record of his consulship, expressing in it their joint disappointment that Britain had &#145;abandoned the dismayed Christians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stirring Times</span>, 475). She helped set up the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Society for the Relief of Distressed Jews, and the Distressed Gentlefolk Aid Association, the last with the assistance of her daughter Constance; she translated the Mahdi's letters to General Gordon for the biography of Gordon; and she was mentor and interpreter to the patriarch of the Ancient Syrian church during his long stay in London in 1875.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Finn died on 18 January 1921 at her home in Hammersmith, London, and was buried beside her husband in Wimbledon churchyard. In 1923 her <span class="italic">Palestine Peasantry</span> was published. Her son's foreword reflects her controversial views: &#145;the lack of anything like national unity among [the people of Palestine] &hellip; would render entrusting them with a measure of self-government a somewhat hazardous experience&#146;  (E. A. Finn, <span class="italic">Palestine Peasantry</span>, 1923, 6). The charities and trusts she helped to establish flourished long after her death.<br>
