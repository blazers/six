<span class="headword">Laforey, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1729?&#150;1796), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Laforey (<i>d</i>. 1753), governor of Pendennis Castle, and Mary Clayton, daughter of Lieutenant-General Jasper Clayton. He was descended from the French Huguenot family of La For&ecirc;t which settled in England during the 1690s. On 12 April 1748 he was promoted lieutenant, and on 24 May 1755 Commodore Augustus Keppel made him commander of the <i>Ontario</i>. In the <i>Hunter</i> he was with Admiral Edward Boscawen's fleet at Louisbourg in 1758. On 25 July he commanded a force of boats which burnt the <i>Prudent</i> and captured the <i>Bienfaisant</i> in Louisbourg harbour, and he was posted captain of the <i>Echo</i> by Boscawen on the following day. He took part in the conquest of Quebec in 1759 and then served in the West Indies, taking part in Admiral George Rodney's capture of Martinique in 1762. At Antigua in 1763 he married Eleanor, daughter of Colonel Francis Farley, member of the council and one of the judges of that island. Laforey commanded the <i>Pallas</i> for a short time in 1770. He commissioned the <i>Ocean</i> in September 1776 and in her took part in the battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778; at the subsequent court martial he gave evidence supporting Admiral Keppel.<br>
<br>In November 1779 Laforey was appointed naval commissioner on the Leeward Islands station, his principal duty being to speed up repairs and cleaning of warships at English Harbour dockyard, Antigua, where he was based. Because naval captains sometimes refused to obey Laforey, claiming he did not have a military commission and was merely a civilian in charge of the dockyard, Rodney reinforced his authority by making him a commodore in August 1780. Unfortunately Laforey later fell out with Rodney over the purchase of naval stores captured at St Eustatius in 1781. Admiral Hugh Pigot replaced Rodney in 1782, but although he was also a supporter of Keppel, Laforey had disagreements with him about the purchase and commissioning of prizes. After the peace in 1783 Laforey returned to England and became naval commissioner at Plymouth Dockyard. He was still there when he was passed over in a promotion of flag officers on 24 September 1787. As in the disputes over his authority during the American War of Independence, it was alleged that his post was only a civil appointment. He challenged the decision and was eventually promoted rear-admiral on 10 November 1789, but with seniority to date from 24 September 1787. He was also created a baronet on 2 December 1789 and was appointed commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station.<br>
<br>Laforey was promoted vice-admiral on 1 February 1793; he was still in the West Indies when war broke out with France, and in April 1793 he captured Tobago. He returned to England in July, but was re-appointed to the Leeward Islands command in 1795, going out in the <i>Amiable</i>, commanded by his son, <a href="#cosubject_15877">Francis Laforey [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He became an admiral on 1 June 1795. During 1795&#150;6 he helped suppress slave revolts on St Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica, while capturing the Dutch colonies of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice. In 1796 he handed over naval command to Sir Hugh Christian before the planned attack on St Lucia and sailed for England in the <i>Majestic</i>. He died at sea of yellow fever on 14 June 1796 and was buried in the governor's chapel at Portsmouth on 21 June. At the time of his death he owned a number of plantations in Antigua.<br>
<br>His only son, <a name="cosubject_15877"></a><span class="headword">Sir Francis Laforey</span>  (1767&#150;1835)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in Virginia on 31 December 1767 and also joined the navy. He was promoted lieutenant on 26 August 1789, commander on 22 November 1790, and captain on 5 June 1793. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1796, and commanded the <i>Spartiate</i> at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Laforey was promoted rear-admiral on 31 July 1810 and was commander-in-chief on the Leeward Islands station between 1811 and 1814. He was made KCB on 2 January 1815, and promoted vice-admiral on 12 August 1819 and admiral on 22 July 1830. He died, unmarried, on 17 June 1835 at Brighton and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
