<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carr, Sir  (William) Emsley</span>  (1867&#150;1941), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 May 1867 at 9 Hunslet Road, Hunslet, Leeds, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Thomas Hay Carr (1842&#150;1927), a cloth manufacturer, and his wife, Sarah Jane Emsley (<i>d</i>. 1905). Educated in his native city, he became a journalist when summoned to Cardiff by his uncle, (Henry) Lascelles Carr (1841&#150;1902), co-founder and first editor-in-chief of the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>. In 1891 a syndicate headed by Lascelles Carr purchased the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, an ailing Sunday scandal sheet founded nearly half a century earlier. The new proprietor dispatched his nephew to London as editor. However, Carr's arrival in Fleet Street did not terminate his close connection with the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> and its associate newspapers: he remained their chief political correspondent until well into the 1930s. Business and family links were consolidated when he married Lascelles's daughter, Jenny Lascelles Carr (1879&#150;1942), on 19 June 1895. Not long after this he became deputy chairman of the parent company, Western Mail and Echo Ltd.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>'s legal representative in London, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35749/', "George Riddell")</script>, became a major shareholder in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, working zealously to boost sales of the new enterprise. Riddell and Carr formed an effective partnership, yet were curiously reticent in acknowledging the scale of their enterprise. Although weekly sales were well over 1 million by the early 1900s, and quadrupled over the next four decades, the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> never publicly acknowledged the full extent of its commercial success. Before the First World War Sabbath-day publication was regularly denounced in the pulpit. Even after all but the most fervent evangelist had acknowledged a seven-day hunger for news, the best-selling Sunday newspapers were still frowned upon within polite circles. Unlike Riddell, whose death in 1934 enabled the Carr family to consolidate their control of the publishing company, the editor and eventual chairman and managing director was always sensitive to middle-class opinion. Knighted in 1918 as reward for his wartime charity work supporting Welsh troops, particularly those captured by the enemy, Carr was a pillar of respectability, successfully distancing himself from even the sauciest front page story. In 1938 he was appointed high sheriff of Glamorgan. When in May 1941 he celebrated fifty years as an editor, Carr found himself enthusiastically toasted by the prime minister and warmly congratulated by the king.<br>
<br>One of the first provincial correspondents at Westminster to gain admittance to the lobby, Carr was a respected pioneer of modern parliamentary reporting, and in 1930&#150;31 he became chairman of the press gallery. He also helped to found the Institute of Journalists, eventually becoming a fellow and in 1932&#150;3 serving as president. Carr took special responsibility within the institute for ensuring that all journalists were adequately provided for in their retirement, and he undertook a similar role in chairing both the Newspaper Press Fund and the Printers Pension Corporation. He was a delegate at the Imperial Press Conference in Canada in 1925, and again five years later in Australia. As a leading figure in the Empire Press Union, Carr also travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent. An inveterate traveller as well as a reporter, the editor vacated his chair to report on the stalemate in France, the surrender of the German fleet at Scapa Flow in 1919, and the subsequent peace conference in Paris.<br>
<br>As chairman of the Alfred Robbins Lodge, Carr raised large sums of money for the Royal Masonic Hospital Fund, fulfilling a similar role for the Royal Free Hospital, in acknowledgement of which he was made a life governor. His sponsorship of annual athletics events is a lasting reminder that he loved sport almost as much as he loved newspapers. His involvement in athletics, and in particular middle-distance running, extended to the organization of the British games, and the selection and preparation of national teams to compete in both the empire games and the Olympic games.<br>
<br>From track to links was but a short stride: witness Carr's vice-presidency of the Professional Golfers' Association, one of several honorary posts awarded for his service to the sport. A member of St Andrew's Royal and Ancient, and chairman of Lloyd George's favourite club, Walton Heath, Carr used golf to bring politicians and the press together in convivial surroundings: he promoted the parliamentary golf tournament, and was president of the Newspapers and Advertisers Golfers Society. A scratch player, Carr was as successful on the greens as off them: his happiest tournament win was probably the press gallery's Arnott cup.<br>
<br>Carr lived only a short distance from the Walton Heath golf course, and he died at his Surrey country residence, Wonford, Walton on the Hill, on 31 July 1941. He was interred at St Peter's, Walton on the Hill, following a funeral at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London, on 5 August 1941. His wife, Jenny, survived him. Their family comprised two daughters and six sons, of whom the eldest had died in action during the First World War. Their twin fourth and fifth sons, Walter Copley Carr (1908&#150;1944) and Henry Lascelles Carr (1908&#150;1943), followed a similar career path to their father, but service in the RAF prevented an early return to the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. Their deaths left the sixth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56742/', "Sir William Emsley Carr (1912&#150;1977)")</script>, as the family's senior representative on the board of an unusually lucrative newspaper enterprise: his father's sensationalist Sunday broadsheet was to emerge from the Second World War with liquid assets of over &pound;2 million, an unprecedented rate of profitability, and weekly sales of approximately 7.5 million. A man of many talents, Sir Emsley Carr had in the course of half a century quietly created the biggest-selling newspaper in the western world.<br>
