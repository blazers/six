<span class="headword">Coward, Sir  Cecil Allen</span>  (1845&#150;1938), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 27 December 1845 at 11 Minerva Terrace, Islington, London, the second child and only son of John William Smith Coward (1815&#150;1888), surgeon, and his first wife, Anna Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bemfield (<i>d</i>. 1847). John Coward was born in Canada where his father was serving with the British army and qualified as an apothecary in 1838, the year before he married. Three years after the death of his first wife John Coward married again.<br>
<br>In 1856 the Coward family&#151;John and his second wife, Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> MacFarlane), Cecil and his sister Emily, and the three young daughters born to John and Jane since they married in 1850&#151;left England for New Zealand. There, after a brief and unsuccessful foray into sheep farming, John Coward established himself as a medical practitioner in Christchurch. He later also became Christchurch's coroner and medical officer to the lunatic asylum, the gaol, and the police. Cecil, who was eleven years old when the family emigrated, was educated at Mrs Alabaster's school in Christchurch where he was coached by her husband, the Revd Charles Alabaster, a noted Latinist. Coward was then articled to his brother-in-law, W. H. Wynn-Williams, another emigrant from Britain who had recently established himself in practice in Christchurch.<br>
<br>In 1865 Cecil Coward left Christchurch for England and when he arrived in London he entered the Inner Temple to read for the bar. It was then customary for would-be barristers to spend some time in a solicitor's office to gain experience and accordingly Coward went to the City firm of Thomas and Hollams (better known in the twentieth century as Coward, Chance &amp; Co. and, since 1987, Clifford Chance), whose offices were then in Mincing Lane. The work and the prospects there, it seems, attracted Coward more than the bar and although he was called in 1867, he applied immediately to be disbarred and took articles with Griffith Thomas, senior partner of Thomas and Hollams. In 1870 Coward was admitted a solicitor and in 1873 he became a partner in the firm.<br>
<br>In 1874 Coward married Catherine Thomas, then aged twenty-six, the younger daughter of his former principal who had been the firm's senior partner from 1862 to 1873 and who was now a director of the Central Bank, a long-established client of the firm. Between 1875 and 1881 five children&#151;four daughters and a son, Cecil Robert&#151;were born to Cecil and Catherine Coward. The family lived in Kensington, where Coward's income from the firm's very profitable practice enabled them to enjoy a comfortable way of life: according to the census returns in 1881 they employed five servants.<br>
<br>The firm, which now became Hollams, Son, and Coward, had been established in the City in 1802 and had built up a large mercantile, shipping, banking, insurance, and corporate practice. John Hollams was its senior partner from 1873 until 1910 and both his own and the firm's name stood high in the profession and in the City. The firm's clients included the Midland Bank, the Commercial Union insurance company, and the Imperial Bank of Persia (later the British Bank of the Middle East). Coward's own work for banking and corporate clients as well as distinguished individuals such as James Bryce (1838&#150;1922) soon brought him a reputation for professional ability and integrity, enhancing that of the firm. Coward was appointed to Lord Macnaughten's judicature committee in 1906, to the royal commission on delays in the King's Bench Division in 1913, and to the royal commission on the civil service in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1910 Coward succeeded Sir John Hollams as senior partner of the firm. Dignified and autocratic, Coward was, as senior partners usually then were, aloof and remote from the staff. A hard worker himself, he would tolerate &#145;neither laziness, shiftiness, nor incompetence in others&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>) and he was a stickler for punctuality. He was not without a sense of humour, however, and those who got to know him found him just and kind. It was Coward as senior partner who decided to offer a partnership to Crompton Llewelyn Davies, in whom were combined great intellectual brilliance and anarchic tendencies. Davies, a Cambridge Apostle and friend of Bertrand Russell, had been articled with the firm and in 1912 had been appointed solicitor to the Post Office. However, in 1920 when his support for his wife's involvement with Sinn F&eacute;in in Ireland and their friendship with Michael Collins were revealed, Davies was dismissed by the Post Office.<br>
<br>Over 6 foot tall, Coward had a fine physique. A keen sportsman all his life, he regularly rode to hounds. He was also a keen golfer and a member of Woking Golf Club. A contemporary recalled that when the train arrived at Woking Station, all that could be seen of Coward, moving at great speed onto the course, was his &#145;coat of indefinably horsy cut with voluminous tails &hellip; flying down the fairway to the first hole&#146;  (Darwin, 82&#150;3).<br>
<br>Like Sir John Hollams, Coward was active in the Law Society, becoming a member of its council in 1910 and serving as president in 1927&#150;8. In 1928 he was knighted, as was then customary for those holding the office. He was also a member of the Justinians, a legal dining club, and of the Reform Club. In 1928, at the age of eighty-two, Coward retired from the firm and from professional life. His son, Robert, who was then aged fifty and a bachelor still very much under his father's thumb, had been a partner in the firm since 1910 and retired at the same time. Cecil Coward died at his home, 10 Melbury Road, Kensington, London, on 27 July 1938, at the age of ninety-two.<br>
