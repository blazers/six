<span class="headword">Boyd,  Archibald</span>  (1803&#150;1883), <span class="occ">dean of Exeter</span>, was born at Londonderry, the son of Archibald Boyd, treasurer of that city. After being educated at the local diocesan college he proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1823, proceeding MA in 1834, and BD and DD in 1868. He officiated as curate and preacher in the cathedral of Londonderry 1827&#150;42, and here first distinguished himself as an able and powerful preacher, as a controversialist, and as an author. At that time the controversy between the presbyterians and the episcopalians of the north of Ireland was at its height. Boyd came to the defence of the established church and preached a series of discourses in reply to attacks. These discourses attracted great attention, and were afterwards printed as <span class="italic">Sermons on the Church</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Episcopacy, Ordination, Lay-Eldership, and Liturgies</span> (1839), and <span class="italic">Episcopacy and Presbytery</span> (1841).<br>
<br>In 1842 Boyd was appointed perpetual curate of Christ Church, Cheltenham. With Francis Close, his fellow worker, he took part in a scheme for establishing additional Sunday schools, infant schools, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, and campaigned for a public library. He became an honorary canon of Gloucester in 1857. He was also a rural dean of the diocese. From 1859 to 1867 he was vicar of Paddington.<br>
<br>On 11 November 1867 Boyd accepted the deanery of Exeter, which he held until his death. Like Dean Close, he was a preaching and a working dean. He was a firm but moderate evangelical, and a voluminous writer on the ecclesiastical questions of the day. Notable among his publications are <span class="italic">England, Rome, and Oxford</span> (1846), a history of the prayer book (1850), <span class="italic">Turkey and the Turks</span> (1853), and works on baptism (1865) and confession (1867). His name is connected with the Exeter reredos case. In 1872&#150;3 the dean and chapter erected in the cathedral a stone reredos, on which were sculptured representations in bas-relief of the ascension, the transfiguration, and the descent of the Holy Ghost, with some figures of angels. In accordance with a petition presented by William John Phillpotts, chancellor of the diocese, the bishop (Frederick Temple) on 7 January 1874 declared the reredos to be contrary to law and ordered its removal. But Boyd's action was found by the privy council (on 25 February 1875) to have been legitimate (or at least not illegitimate). At Exeter, Boyd attempted to suppress vicars choral.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1882 Boyd had an accident at Vienna from which he never fully recovered. He died at the deanery, Exeter, on 11 July 1883, bequeathing nearly &pound;40,000 to various societies and institutions in the diocese of Exeter. His wife, Frances, daughter of Thomas Waller of Ospringe, and widow of the Revd Robert Day Denny, had died on 6 January 1877, and Boyd's considerable estate may have come from her.<br>
