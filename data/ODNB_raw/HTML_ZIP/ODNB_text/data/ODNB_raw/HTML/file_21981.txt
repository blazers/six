<span class="headword">Perring,  John Shae</span>  (1813&#150;1869), <span class="occ">civil engineer and surveyor</span>, was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, on 24 January 1813. He was educated at Donington grammar school, and then articled, on 28 March 1826, to Robert Reynolds, the surveyor of the port of Boston, under whom he was engaged in surveying, in the enclosure and drainage of the fens, in the improvements of Boston harbour and of Wainfleet haven, and the outfall of the East Fen, in the drainage of the Burgh and Croft marshes, and other works. In 1833 he moved to London, where he worked with various engineering establishments.<br>
<br>In March 1836 Perring went to Egypt, under contract with Galloway Brothers of London, as assistant engineer to Galloway Bey, then manager of public works for Mehmet Ali, viceroy of Egypt. One of the first undertakings on which Perring was engaged was the construction of a tramway from the quarries near El Mex to the sea. After the death of Galloway he became a member of the board of public works, was consulted on the Nile Embankment, advocated the establishment of stations in the desert between Cairo and Suez to facilitate overland transit, and was employed in constructing a road in order to carry out this scheme.<br>
<br>From January to August 1837 Perring was employed assisting Colonel R. W. H. Vyse and others in carrying out a survey of the pyramids at Giza, and in the production of plans, drawings, and maps of these monuments. He had already published, in 1835, a number of pamphlets, &#145;On the engineering of the ancient Egyptians&#146;. During 1838 and 1839 he explored and surveyed the pyramids at Abu Roash, and those further south, including Fayyum. His contributions to the history of Egypt and the pyramids are described in a major work in three parts, <span class="italic">The Pyramids of Gizeh</span>, which was published in 1839. Perring's work is also referred to in a later publication by Colonel Vyse, <span class="italic">Operations Carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837</span> (3 vols., 1840). Perring, before leaving Egypt, made a trigonometrical survey of 53 miles of country near the pyramids. The value of these researches, all made at Colonel Vyse's expense, are fully acknowledged in C. C. J. Bunsen's <span class="italic">Egypt's Place in Universal History</span> (5 vols., 1854) where it is stated that they supplied the names of six Egyptian kings until then unknown.<br>
<br>Perring returned to England in June 1840, and on 1 March 1841 entered upon the duties of engineering superintendent of the Llanelli railway docks and harbour. In April 1844 he was associated with the Manchester, Bury, and Rossendale Railway, which he helped to complete; after its amalgamation with other lines he was, from 1846 until 1859, resident engineer of the East Lancashire Railway. He was subsequently involved with the Railway, Steel, and Plant Company, was engineer of the Ribblesdale Railway, and constructed the joint lines from Wigan to Blackburn. He was also engineer of the Oswaldtwistle and other waterworks. Finally, he was one of the engineers of the Manchester city railways. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 6 December 1853, and in 1856 became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He died of a stroke at his home, Broom Mount, Cheetham Hill, Manchester, on 26 January 1869. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Millard Perring.<br>
