<span class="headword">Norgate,  Thomas Starling</span>  (1772&#150;1859), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Norwich on 20 August 1772, the eldest child of Elias Norgate (1727&#150;1803), surgeon, and his wife, Deborah (1733&#150;1801), the daughter of Thomas Starling, from a family of coach-painters and ironmongers. Elias Norgate was a member of the Presbyterian and later Unitarian congregation at the Octagon Chapel in Norwich. Thomas Norgate was educated first by John Baxter and then at the Norwich Free School, where until 1785 the headmaster was the famous classical scholar Samuel Parr, to whom Norgate later attributed &#145;my present great ignorance of classical literature&#146;  (Norgate). In 1788 he entered New College, Hackney, a dissenting foundation headed by Thomas Belsham, newly recruited to Unitarianism from Independency. On leaving Hackney, Norgate was apprenticed to a firm of solicitors, Kinderley and Long, in Chancery Lane and was entered at Lincoln's Inn. He kept his terms but disliked the practice of law and returned to Norwich. In London he had often visited William Beloe, also from Norwich, and on his advice began to write essays and pamphlets and to review for the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. In 1795 he inherited the estate belonging to his maternal grandmother at Hethersett, Norfolk, and retired there. On 4 August 1797 he married Mary Susan Randall (1774&#150;1857), the daughter of Benjamin Randall, a bankrupt East India merchant. They had eight sons and four daughters. The eldest son, Elias, died in 1833, aged thirty-five.<br>
<br>Norgate was an intimate of the Norwich literary circle, whose best-known member was William Taylor (1765&#150;1836). Through William Enfield, minister of the Octagon Chapel, he regularly contributed to the <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span> until its demise in 1799, and wrote for other periodicals connected with the Unitarian intelligentsia, notably the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, for which between 1797 and 1807 he wrote a semi-annual review of literature published in England, and the <span class="italic">Annual Review</span> (1802&#150;8) of Arthur Aikin, to which Norgate contributed about a seventh of the contents. He also wrote for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>.<br>
<br>Norgate opened a fire insurance office, the Anchor, in Norwich, but claims exceeded capital and a clerk, William Calthorpe, proved to be a swindler, so after three years he sold the business. In 1809 Norgate became a partner of Benjamin Dowson (1763?&#150;1843), a corn and coal merchant at Geldeston, near Norwich; this venture also failed, and a later determination to emigrate to either France or the Netherlands was frustrated by the return of Napoleon from Elba. He returned to Hethersett, where he again combined farming and a literary career. He contributed the sections on agriculture and horticulture to the <span class="italic">General History of the County of Norfolk</span> (2 vols., 1829) and in the same year founded the Norfolk and Norwich Horticultural Society. He also helped to found and, assisted by his son Elias, edited a weekly paper, the <span class="italic">East Anglian</span>, published from 1830 to 1833. He died at Hethersett on 7 July 1859.<br>
<br>Norgate's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_20255"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Starling Norgate</span>  (1807&#150;1893)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Hethersett on 30 December 1807. He was educated at Norwich grammar school under Edward Valpy (1764&#150;1832) and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1827 and graduated BA in 1832. He was curate successively of Runton, Briningham, Cley next the Sea, and Banningham, all in Norfolk, and was collated rector of Sparham, Norfolk, in 1840. He married Caroline Roxalana, daughter of Francis Cremer Woodrow; they had five children. He was the author of three translations of Homeric poems; <span class="italic">Batrachomyomachia: an Homeric Fable Reproduced in Dramatic Blank Verse</span> (1863); the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> (1863); and the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1864). He died at Sparham on 25 November 1893.<br>
<br>The youngest son, <a name="cosubject_67852"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Norgate</span>  (1817&#150;1908), born at Hethersett on 20 or 21 November 1817, was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1835, moved to Clare College the next year, and graduated BA in 1839. Intended for the church, in 1843 he became a <span class="occ">bookseller</span> and a partner in the publishing firm of Williams and Norgate. After two decades he retired to devote himself to his scholarly interests, especially the poetry of William Caxton. In 1850 he married Fanny, daughter of John Athow, stonemason and surveyor of the Norwich city pavements; their only child was the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35248/', "Kate Norgate (1853&#150;1935)")</script>. Frederick Norgate died at his home in Ashchurch Grove, Shepherd's Bush, London, on 10 August 1908.<br>
