<span class="headword">Somer,  Paul  van</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1670&#150;1694), <span class="occ">etcher and engraver</span>, was a Frenchman, presumably of Dutch ancestry, who settled in London about 1675. Nothing is known about his origins and training, and he first appears in Paris between 1670 and 1674 making etchings of religious subjects and portraits. A plate of <span class="italic">Hagar in the Wilderness</span> is signed &#145;Londini&#146; and dated 1675, but forms part of a set that was published in Paris. For several years van Somer maintained his links with France by sending plates back for publication there, and in 1676 he made two title-pages for books published in Amsterdam. George Vertue says that van Somer was a protestant refugee, and this is confirmed by a series of etched portraits of French ministers of the Huguenot Savoy Chapel, of which the only recorded impressions are in the Pepys Library in Magdalene College, Cambridge. His first mezzotints were made in Paris; a plate made in London in 1676 is one of the earliest dated mezzotints made in England. But his output of thirty-three mezzotints does not begin to approach the total of 209 etchings listed in F. W. H. Hollstein's catalogue of early modern Dutch and Flemish etchings, engravings, and woodcuts.<br>
<br>During the 1680s van Somer was publishing his own and others' plates at his address at the Eagle and Child, near Leicester Fields. He made some prints after the paintings of Paul Mignard (1639&#150;1691), the nephew of Pierre Mignard, who spent a few years in London, and published a few plates of a fellow Huguenot refugee, Simon Gribelin. He was naturalized on 5 March 1691. The last appearance of his name is in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> of 16 July 1694, when &#145;Paul van Somer's sale of fine plate, pictures and other curiosities&#146; by lottery was advertised. It is not clear whether he was then still alive.<br>
<br>Van Somer's career overlaps with that of Jan van Somer (<i>fl</i>. 1660&#150;1687), who is stated by Vertue to have been one of the most prolific, albeit usually anonymous, of the early mezzotint engravers working in London. There are hardly any records of his career, and his relationship, if any, to Paul is unknown, although it has often been asserted that the two were brothers.<br>
