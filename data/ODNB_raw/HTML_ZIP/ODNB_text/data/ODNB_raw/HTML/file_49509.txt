<span class="headword">Ibbetson, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1708&#150;1761), <span class="occ">cloth merchant</span>, was born in Leeds, the third surviving son of James Ibbetson (1674&#150;1739) and his wife, Elizabeth, the coheir of Dr John Nicholson, York's premier medical practitioner in the late seventeenth century. Ibbetson was a fourth-generation cloth merchant and a member of one of the town's leading merchant dynasties. His father had made a large fortune in exporting West Riding cloth; he was also a considerable buyer of land in the county, and in 1717 purchased the 2000 acre Denton Hall estate, near Ilkley, from the Fairfax family. Nothing is known of either Henry's education or his training; in both cases it was likely to have been expensive. On 23 December 1736 he married Catherine (1717&#150;1740), the fourth daughter of Francis Foljambe of Aldwarke, a prominent Yorkshire landowner. She died childless within four years of the marriage, and on 6 October 1741 he married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1757), the elder daughter of Ralph Carr of Cocken Hall, co. Durham. They quickly produced a family of ten children, four sons and six daughters, of whom three failed to survive infancy.<br>
<br>James Ibbetson was a ruthlessly successful man, and when he died in 1739 he passed on to his favourite and, by then, younger son, a great deal of scattered property in Leeds and the West Riding, which produced more than &pound;1000 per annum, as well as one of the leading merchant houses in Leeds. Henry lacked his father's cutting edge, and his career developed in a variety of not entirely reconcilable directions. Clearly, extending the family fortunes to support and launch a large family with landowning connections and pretensions was uppermost in his mind. The export house in Leeds was continued until his death in 1761, for the last thirteen years of its existence with the aid of an active German partner, John Koster. A letter-book survives for the 1750s showing the firm to be one of high repute and tradition, dealing with importers in Germany, Flanders, and the western Mediterranean. By this stage it was probably past its zenith, for Ibbetson became increasingly involved in coalmining ventures and, after 1758, with a fellow merchant, Peter Birt, in farming the extremely lucrative Aire and Calder navigation tolls. He had long been handling the remittances of the East and West Riding land tax receivers, an activity which meshed well with his merchanting activities.<br>
<br>Although Ibbetson never lived at Denton, it became clear that it would pass to him, or his eldest son, since his elder brother, a barrister, produced no male heir. Certainly by the 1750s he was buying further land at Denton from the proceeds of property sales in Leeds and elsewhere. His ambition to launch his eldest son as a major West Riding landowner was fuelled by a baronetcy bestowed on him in 1748 as a reward for zealously raising a hundred men at his own expense in the Jacobite rising of 1745 and serving as high sheriff of Yorkshire two years later. But Ibbetson appears never to have lived elsewhere than in Leeds, either in villas on its edge or in the family's town house in Kirkgate, which John Carr (it was one of his earliest commissions) extended in 1752. He was mayor of Leeds in 1753&#151;a record promotion, since he had served only three months on the corporation&#151;and he also acted as a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire. He died on 22 June 1761 in York (while consulting a doctor there) after a protracted illness, and was buried in Leeds parish church. The firm's letter-book records his earlier visits to Bath and London in search of a medical cure. His wife had predeceased him four years earlier. Ibbetson's ambitions were realized within a decade of his death when his son James (1746&#150;1795), the second baronet, inherited Denton (where Carr built the Ibbetsons a splendid new house in the 1770s) in 1768, the same year in which he married Jenny Caygill, the heir of a Halifax merchant with an estate in Essex.<br>
