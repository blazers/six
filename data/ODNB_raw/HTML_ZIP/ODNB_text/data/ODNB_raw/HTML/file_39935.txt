<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Harrison, Sir  Reginald Carey <span class="st"> [Rex]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 5 March 1908 in Huyton, Lancashire, the youngest of three children and only son of William Reginald Harrison, stockbroker, and his wife, Edith Mary Carey. At the age of ten he adopted the name Rex, by which he was known for the rest of his life. He was a sickly child and a bout of measles left him with poor sight in his left eye. He was educated at Birkdale preparatory school and Liverpool College. His appearances in school plays, and regular visits to the Liverpool Playhouse, confirmed an early desire to be an actor. At sixteen he was taken on at the playhouse and after a year backstage made his acting d&eacute;but in 1924 in <span class="italic">Thirty Minutes in a Street</span>. After two and a half years playing small roles, he left Liverpool for London, where in 1927 he landed a part in a touring production of <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span>. Thus began six years of touring and repertory, in which he learned his craft. It was a five-month run as a caddish explorer in <span class="italic">Heroes Don't Care</span> in 1936 that provided his breakthrough. The critic of <span class="italic">Theatre World</span> proclaimed him &#145;one of the best light comedians on the English stage&#146; and he maintained this position until his death.<br>
<br>On the basis of <span class="italic">Heroes Don't Care</span>, the producer Alexander Korda signed a contract with Harrison at London Films, and he was launched on a cinematic career, which he was to continue henceforth in tandem with his stage career. He achieved an early success in the delightful comedy <span class="italic">Storm in a Teacup</span> (1936), where as a crusading reporter he was taught by the director Victor Saville how to relax in front of the camera. He consolidated his theatrical reputation with long runs in <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Design for Living</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">No Time for Comedy</span> (1941). From 1942 to 1944 he served in the Royal Air Force volunteer reserve as a flying-control liaison officer. Emerging from the forces, he established himself as a major British film star in the screen version of <span class="italic">Blithe Spirit</span> (1945) and in <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span> (1945), in which he was excellent as a charming, feckless, parasitic playboy, who expiates a worthless life with a heroic death on the battlefield.<br>
<br>Hollywood inevitably beckoned and Harrison signed a seven-year contract with Twentieth Century Fox. They saw him not as a light comedian but as a character actor. The vehicles they provided for him, if not always to his taste, were invariably superbly mounted and stretched him as an actor. In <span class="italic">Anna and the King of Siam</span> (1946), Harrison was both comic and touching as the capricious but dedicated King Mongkut. In <span class="italic">The Ghost and Mrs Muir</span> (1947), playing the spirit of an old sea dog, he took to being blasphemous and bad-tempered with evident glee. In <span class="italic">Unfaithfully Yours</span> (1948) he played an autocratic and egocentric orchestral conductor with a memorable line in vituperation. But his continuing unhappiness in Hollywood, his unflattering comments on the film capital, poor box-office returns on his later Fox films, and an unsavoury scandal surrounding the suicide of actress Carole Landis, with whom he was having an affair, led Harrison and Fox to terminate the contract by mutual consent. He returned to Broadway to play Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson's <span class="italic">Anne of the Thousand Days</span> (1948) at the Shubert Theatre, New York, and promptly won a Tony award as best actor. Then in London and on Broadway he did John Van Druten's play <span class="italic">Bell, Book and Candle</span> (1950) and directed and starred in Peter Ustinov's play <span class="italic">The Love of Four Colonels</span> (1953). He won the 1961 Evening Standard best actor award for his performance in Anton Chekhov's <span class="italic">Platonov</span> at the Royal Court Theatre in 1960.<br>
<br>Harrison resolutely avoided Shakespeare, but became the supreme interpreter of the plays of Bernard Shaw, bringing the necessary quality of civilized intelligence to his performances both on stage (<span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span>, 1983; <span class="italic">The Devil's Disciple</span>, 1977) and film (<span class="italic">Major Barbara</span>, 1940&#150;41). He will for ever be associated with the role of Professor Henry Higgins in <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span>, the Lerner and Loewe musical based on Shaw's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span>. Harrison played the part for three years on stage in New York and London (1956&#150;9), winning a second Tony award, and an Oscar for his performance in the film version (1964). So much did he make the part his own that he later said: &#145;For years I could never bear to see anyone else do it&#151;Higgins has become so much a part of me and I, of him.&#146;<br>
<br>Harrison's success in <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span> made him a major international star and led to appearances in several screen epics in the 1960s. There was more than a touch of Shaw's Julius Caesar in his drily witty and very human performance as the Roman conqueror in <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1963). When Caesar expired half-way through, so did the film. The ponderous film about Michelangelo, <span class="italic">The Agony and the Ecstasy</span> (1965), was almost redeemed by Harrison's engaging interpretation of Pope Julius II as an urbane schemer.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s there was a string of expensive flops&#151;<span class="italic">The Honey Pot</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Doctor Doolittle</span> (1966), <span class="italic">A Flea in her Ear</span> (1967)&#151;and in the 1970s and 1980s Harrison's film appearances were mainly cameos, though he played Don Quixote in a notable 1973 BBC television production. He concentrated his energies on the stage, displaying his gifts in London and New York in a series of Edwardian revivals: <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Aren't we All?</span> (1984&#150;5), <span class="italic">The Admirable Crichton</span> (1988), and <span class="italic">The Circle</span> (1989). He was appearing in <span class="italic">The Circle</span> when his final illness was diagnosed. Harrison was married six times, and allegedly mistreated all his wives. His first wife (1934) was the fashion model Collette Thomas (her real name was Marjorie). They had one son, the actor and singer Noel Harrison (1934&#150;2013), and were divorced in 1943. His second wife was the &eacute;migr&eacute; German Jewish actress Lilli Palmer (1914&#150;1986) (whose real name was Lilli Peiser), whom he married on 25 January 1943. They had one son, the playwright Carey Harrison (<i>b</i>. 1944), and were divorced in 1957. His third wife (23 June 1957) was the English actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57349/', "Kay Kendall (1927&#150;1959)")</script>, who died of leukaemia at the age of thirty-two. Their relationship was the basis of the play <span class="italic">After Lydia</span>, by Sir Terence Rattigan, in which Harrison starred on Broadway in 1974, playing the role based on himself. He married his fourth wife on 21 March 1962, the Welsh actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67830/', "Rachel Roberts (1927&#150;1980)")</script>, daughter of the Revd Richard Rhys Roberts. They divorced in 1971 and she committed suicide in 1980. His fifth wife (26 August 1971) was Mrs (Joan) Elizabeth Rees Harris (<i>b</i>. 1936), daughter of David Rees Rees-Williams, first Baron Ogmore, and ex-wife of actor Richard Harris. They divorced in 1976. He married finally on 17 December 1978 an American, Mercia Tinker. Harrison wrote two volumes of autobiography and three of his wives left their impressions of him in their autobiographies.<br>
<br>Harrison was a man of enormous charm and this often compensated for the personal and professional self-centredness and perfectionism that sometimes tried the patience of colleagues and associates. He was perhaps the last Edwardian, compeer of Sir Gerald Du Maurier, Sir Charles Hawtrey, and Sir (E.) Seymour Hicks, actors who contrived to give the impression that they had just popped into the theatre for a spot of acting on the way to the club. Harrison had admired and closely studied the style and technique of the great Edwardians and had come to embody the same combination of elegance, authority, wit, and grace. He was appointed commendatore of Italy's order of merit in 1967, awarded an honorary degree by the University of Boston in 1973, and knighted in 1989. He died of cancer of the pancreas in New York on 2 June 1990. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered over the sea near Portofino, Italy, where he had owned a villa from 1949 to 1976.<br>
