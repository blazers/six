<span class="headword">Burns,  Richard Alexander</span>  (1971&#150;2005), <span class="occ">rally driver</span>, was born on 17 January 1971 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, the first of two children born to Alexander Kenmir (Alex) Burns, computer manager, and his wife, Denise Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pettafor. He was brought up in Henley-on-Thames, then Hook End, Checkendon. His interest in motor cars became apparent at a very early age and by the time he was eight he was to be found practising his driving skills on a circuit of some 165 yards around the yard of his parents' farmhouse. He also gained driving experience by volunteering to reverse horse trailers at his sister's pony club, and eventually became a member of the Under 17 Car Club. However, it was a visit to Jan Churchill's rally driving school in Wales, a fifteenth birthday present, that prompted him to commit his future to motor sport. He worked part time in order to raise the funds to support his ambitions but it was the backing of family and friends that was instrumental in allowing him to pursue them. His father was particularly supportive, providing him with his first rally car, a Sunbeam, which, with a friend, he converted to rally specification. This was the first and only rally car he actually owned, the remainder coming from supporters who admired his driving ability, including members of the Craven Motor Club in Reading. After honing his technique in a number of secondary meetings in 1988 and 1989 Burns participated in the 1990 RAC rally, his first involvement in a world championship event.<br>
<br>David Williams, a rally enthusiast who had appreciated the young Burns's potential, was another important influence in his emergence as a key figure in British motor sport, providing finance and introducing him to Prodrive, Subaru's rally team in Britain. Prodrive became important in improving Burns's understanding of rallying and, with their support, in 1993 he became the youngest ever driver to win the British rally championship. It was during this period that Burns got to know Robert Reid, who became his principal co-driver for thirteen years.<br>
<br>Burns's opportunities with Prodrive became limited by the success of his team-mate, Colin McRae, in the world championships of 1995, so he moved to Mitsubishi to further his career. He gained valuable experience during his three seasons with Mitsubishi, benefiting from partnering Tommi M&auml;kinen, the Flying Finn. His successes even enabled him to challenge M&auml;kinen as the team's principal driver. In 1998 he won the gruelling Safari rally in Kenya, his first victory in the world rally championship, and in the same year enjoyed success in the British rally.<br>
<br>With his status in motor sport greatly enhanced, Burns left Mitsubishi in 1999 to rejoin Prodrive and Subaru as the team's lead driver. He won a number of events with Prodrive and came second two years running in the world championship, in 1999 and 2000, before securing the title in 2001. He was the first Englishman and only the second Briton after Colin McRae to win the world rally championship, the sport's highest achievement. The reasons for his subsequent move in 2001 from Prodrive to the Peugeot team based in France are not entirely clear. It turned out to be a two-year low in his career, and he was overshadowed by the success of his team-mate, Marcus Gr&ouml;nholm, who had narrowly beaten him to the world title in 2000. Burns had already decided to return to Subaru when he suffered a blackout <i>en route</i> to the Wales rally GB in November 2003. He was later diagnosed with astrocytoma, a form of brain tumour.<br>
<br>Burns claimed that he was not particularly blessed with natural talent as a driver, though he was recognized as being courageous, thoughtful, and tactically astute. Although determined to succeed, he did not drive beyond the limit of where he felt in control of the car. He believed strongly in the importance of personal fitness, including an appropriate diet, as well as the value of sports psychology in tackling the physical and mental problems that accompanied rallying at the highest levels. He was held in high regard, both personally and professionally, by his many followers and colleagues in the sport. His success contributed to the popularity of rallying as a television spectacle. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Driving Ambition</span>, was published in 2002. About 2001 he formed a relationship with Zo&euml; Keen, a television producer, who supported him through his final illness. He died on 25 November 2005 at the Wellington Hospital (North), 27 Circus Road, Westminster, and was survived by her and his father Alex, his mother having predeceased him. A memorial service was held at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, on 22 December 2005, and the following year the Richard Burns Foundation was launched, to &#145;inspire and support people with serious injury and illness&#146;  (www.richardburnsfoundation.com).<br>
