<span class="headword">Francis,  (Bertram) Frederick</span>  (1919&#150;1998), <span class="occ">engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 15 October 1919 at 30 Sumatra Road, Hampstead, London, the only child of Walter Henry Francis (<i>b</i>. 1892), businessman, and his wife, Florence Eleanor Dell (<i>b</i>. 1898). Fred, as he was usually known, was educated at Finchley Catholic grammar school, though he belonged to the Church of England. He left at the age of fourteen and took a job at an electrical engineering company, moving on in 1934 to the office of a shopfitter's, where he learned administrative skills. In 1939 he founded his own tool-making business in Mill Hill, and the company operated twenty-four hours a day to provide supplies for the war. It was his intention to join the RAF&#151;he had already obtained his pilot's licence&#151;but he felt better employed in production. After the war, he took a flight in a light aircraft, and was hooked; within three weeks he had bought his own plane, and he remained passionate about flying for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>His firm thrived after the war, but Francis became bored and turned to making toys, which he had wanted to do since his childhood. He founded Minimodels in 1947, and demand became so great for the tin-plate toys that in 1953 the company moved to a purpose-built factory in Havant, Hampshire. This also allowed him to sail, and for a time he lived aboard his 46 foot yacht, <i>Yvalda</i>, which was moored in Chichester. In 1952 Francis had patented a keyless clockwork winding mechanism, and now he placed it in a range of metal-bodied model racing cars: these &#145;Scalex&#146; cars, and the complementary &#145;Startex&#146; range, were very popular&#151;perhaps in response to the scarcity of toys during and immediately after the war&#151;but the toy trade proved capricious and demand soon collapsed.<br>
<br>In 1956, however, Francis saw a demonstration by Victory Industries of &#145;rail racing&#146;&#151;battery-powered model cars, guided by the raised edges of a roadway. An exceptional engineer, he quickly adapted his Scalex models to take an electric motor; he also devised a track system with metal rails carrying an electric current in two parallel grooves, along which players could guide the cars. Since the name of Scalex was well established but the cars were now electrically powered, the new product was called Scalextric; it was unveiled in January 1957 at the annual Harrogate toy fair. It was a sensation. The price for the most basic set was &pound;5 19<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and by 1958 demand was far greater than production capability&#151;and even the North American market, for a long time impenetrable to British toys, began to ask for more. He felt that the availability of layouts in shops for public use ensured the toy's rapid success. On 1 November 1958 Francis sold Minimodels to the Lines Brothers Group, the world's largest toy manufacturer.<br>
<br>Francis decided to return to London, where he dabbled with pile-driving in the Thames and invested in a company that towed wood pulp, Tough-Henderson, which by 1965 was very profitable. But he again decided to move on, sensing that the company would suffer with the emergence of container vessels. A great Francophile who frequently sailed in and around that country, Francis set off for the Mediterranean in his new boat, <i>Fredela</i>. On his return, he accepted an invitation from Victory to join the company as a technical adviser; in 1966 their slot-racing game was voted the best on the market by <span class="italic">Which?</span> magazine. The following year, when he returned to Chichester, he met Diane Elizabeth Haines (<i>b</i>. 1945); they married on 3 April 1978 and had two daughters, Catherine and Julia. This was his second marriage, an earlier marriage in 1956 to a woman named Hazel having lasted only a few months.<br>
<br>During the 1960s and 1970s Francis also spent time thinking about winches. He had been unhappy with their performance during the building of <i>Fredela</i>, and had made a fully enclosed electric winch himself; it pleased him so much that in 1963 he marketed a commercial version. Although it preceded the mass-produced yacht, and although many in the industry mistrusted electricity on boats, it soon became well known and he later developed a new model, of which a modified version was used by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. He sold the company when it was doing well, but in 1977 he saw the market expanding and returned to business with a third generation of the &#145;Francis winch&#146;, which the lifeboat institution also adopted.<br>
<br>Meanwhile there was still a demand for Scalextric. Sales had decreased at the end of the 1960s because of inflation, but the game, its basic design virtually unchanged, remained in production, now competing against the appeal of the home computer. Francis also entertained children by talking at local schools about the birth of Scalextric and its success.<br>
<br>In 1985 Francis was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph system and was given a year to live; he survived for thirteen years. He sold his winch-building company, but spent time restoring old motorbikes and continued to sail in his beloved <i>Fredela</i>. He died peacefully on 6 January 1998 after a viral infection forced him into St Richard's Hospital, Chichester. Ten days later he was buried near his home, in St James's Church in Birdham, Sussex. His wife, Diane, and their two daughters survived him.<br>
