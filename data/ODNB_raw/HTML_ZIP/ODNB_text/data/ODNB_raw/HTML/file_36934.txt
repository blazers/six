<span class="headword">Williamson,  John Thoburn</span>  (1907&#150;1958), <span class="occ">geologist and diamond mine owner</span>, was born at Montfort, Quebec, Canada, on 10 February 1907, the second of four children and elder son of Bertie J. Williamson, owner of a timber company, and his wife, Rose C. Boyd, who was of French extraction. His father had emigrated from Ireland but was of Scottish descent. The family moved to Montreal when he was twelve. From Macdonald high school at Ste Anne de Bellevue, Williamson entered McGill University where he was soon diverted from law to geology, in which he became interested during a geological expedition on which he accompanied a friend and a group of students. He also became well read in more general literature. Social life he despised but he liked sport and outdoor activities and especially enjoyed fencing. He obtained his BA degree in 1928 with honours in geology, was awarded the Leroy memorial fellowship in geology in 1929, a bursary of the National Research Council of Canada in 1930&#150;31, became a demonstrator in geology and mineralogy, and graduated MSc in 1930 and PhD in 1933.<br>
<br>In 1933 Williamson accompanied his former professor of geology, Dr Richard Graham, to Johannesburg, where he gave a few lectures to the geology students at the University of the Witwatersrand. Graham had been invited by the directors of De Beers Consolidated Mines to inspect and report on some land which they suspected was diamondiferous. This was the beginning of Williamson's fascination with diamonds and with De Beers, which controlled most of the world's diamond production and marketing at the time. When he was offered a position as a field geologist by a subsidiary of De Beers, Loangwa Concessions, he accepted. This was his introduction to prospecting. The company was searching for copper on the Luangwa River in the north-east corner of Northern Rhodesia, not far from the Tanganyika border. Williamson's application to De Beers for permission to prospect for diamonds in Tanganyika and for a financial grant was refused and he resigned.<br>
<br>Williamson had his first diamond experience in 1935 when he joined the Tanganyika Gold and Diamond Development Company, working under their American chief geologist, Hank Le Tendresse, whom he succeeded. In 1937 the company decided to suspend operations on grounds of the meagre yields of diamonds but Williamson remained in Tanganyika as an independent prospector. He subsequently took out rights entitling him to prospect for diamonds in Tanganyika. He prospected all over the Lake and the Western province but found nothing worthwhile. He next took a sub-lease of the Mabuki diamond mine, the first to be discovered in Tanganyika, which had been worked since 1925 but yielded too few diamonds to be viable. He pegged two claims nearby and got another area at Kizumbi. By now he had discovered many diamondiferous areas and odd diamonds here and there and had formed the theory that all these stones originated from one source somewhere in Lake province. In his search for diamonds he lived rough, was often ill, and had very little money; but he had a determined faith in his theory which finally brought him to an area which became known as Mwadui. There he found a good gem and from the formation of the gravel came to the conclusion that Mwadui was the source he had been seeking. On 6 March 1940 he pegged some mining claims and obtained an exclusive prospecting licence. In April he pegged further claims and got another licence. Suddenly further prospecting in the country was forbidden and Williamson was unable to register all his claims. An Indian lawyer, I. C. Chopra, living at Mwanza, advised him to form a limited liability company with a nominal capital of 400 shares of &pound;500 each. Williamson kept 299 shares, gave 100 to his brother Percy, and Chopra bought one. Thus the Mwadui mine, commonly referred to as Williamsons, was born.<br>
<br>Owing to the war and the threat of Italian invasion, Williamson had to operate with the most primitive equipment and very little help. He himself started the men on their work early in the morning and supervised the digging, washing, and sorting of the gravel. Then he drove 12 miles to a river for water in a lorry which often got stuck or broke down. On his return he gave food to the men, then dealt meticulously with the paperwork. Despite the difficulties he spared no effort or expense in looking after his workmen, of whom there were soon 2500. Using mostly local materials he provided houses, a hospital, offices, and other buildings. But it was not until after 1947 that the mine could be properly developed.<br>
<br>Meantime in 1941 the Colonial Office had advised Williamson of the urgent need for industrial diamonds and he made every effort to produce as many as possible. The Germans, who were in still greater need, managed to get some parcels of stolen diamonds smuggled through to them before the allies put an end to the traffic. The theft of diamonds from the mine, however, continued, and by 1946 had reached such proportions that there were those who thought that the mine had petered out. Williamson knew better, but it was not until 1947 that the government could provide police and not until some years later that the ringleaders were caught and given sentences so stiff that the theft of diamonds was suppressed.<br>
<br>In 1946 Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, who was always immediately informed of any major discovery of diamonds, became extremely worried about the Mwadui production&#151;by now amounting to &pound;1.5 million a year&#151;which Williamson was selling on the open market, and about the effect this could have on world prices. Furthermore the mine, which was a gem producer with a long working life, posed a direct threat to the profitability of De Beers. Williamson, on the other hand, disliked monopolies and had not forgotten the time De Beers had refused permission for him to prospect on their behalf in Tanganyika. After some tough and protracted bargaining the recalcitrant Williamson in 1947 signed a 5-year agreement with the Diamond Corporation, controlled by De Beers, in terms of which Williamson Diamonds would be entitled to a quota percentage of all sales on the world markets by the corporation at current prices. Three years later this agreement caused a serious rift between the two parties which resulted in Williamson preferring to stockpile rather than sell his production to the Diamond Corporation. The official agreement had run its stipulated period of 5 years in January 1952. Williamson's stockpile reputedly was worth more than &pound;6 million and there were plenty of prospective buyers on the market if he refused to renew the agreement. Early in March 1952 Harry Oppenheimer, De Beers's chief representative, flew to Mwadui. The outcome of the meeting with Williamson was a new agreement which would satisfy everyone, and the Diamond Corporation would sell the stockpile. Tanganyika's diamond exports in 1952 amounted to &pound;4.5 million compared with &pound;74,000 in 1951.<br>
<br>After 1948 expansion was rapid. Many buildings were erected, a heavy media plant was ordered to be built, and roads were constructed and planted with shady trees. Mwadui became a garden city, and the mine became a sanctuary for birds, which came in hundreds to settle on the ponds. Williamson built two very large dams near the mine so that the country round about became cool and green and the increased rainfall brought many benefits. He was most averse to declaring any dividend of the profits of the mine. They were either ploughed back or utilized for contributing to the general good of the country. He provided a school at Shinyanga, financed higher education, and gave &pound;50,000 to Makerere College, Uganda, for building science classrooms.<br>
<br>Intensely loyal to the crown and Commonwealth, Williamson subscribed heavily to the war loan, gave generously to wartime funds and the Red Cross, and in recognition of his war services transferred a quarter of the mine to his brother, who had been seriously wounded in a commando raid. In October 1947 a rose-coloured diamond of rare beauty weighing 54&frac12; carats was found. Cut and polished it weighed 23.6 carats. It was made into a brooch surrounded with over a hundred blue-white diamonds of finest purity and presented to the Princess Elizabeth on her marriage to Prince Philip. Another magnificent brooch of blue-white diamonds was presented to Princess Margaret in 1957 when she visited Mwadui.<br>
<br>Williamson gave large sums to help mining ventures in east Africa and had he not died when he did he would have contributed considerably to the building up of a newly independent east Africa and especially Tanzania. But symptoms of cancer of the throat became manifest and, despite consultation and treatment in London and Canada, he died at Mwadui on 8 January 1958. He was buried there on the same day, less than two months after Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, who had died on 25 November 1957. A statue representing him was erected near the baobab tree where he first camped when he started prospecting at Mwadui. He had received the honorary degree of DSc from McGill in 1956 but as a Canadian citizen had had to refuse the offer of a knighthood.<br>
<br>Williamson seldom spent any money on himself and went about in khaki drill trousers and an open-necked shirt with short sleeves. He was a handsome man, nearly 6 feet tall, with dark brown hair, and was often mistaken for the well-known film actor Clark Gable. Williamson, who became a legend in his own lifetime, was shy and retiring, taciturn by nature and secretive, but had charming manners and a fine sense of humour which extended to practical jokes. His generosity was proverbial and often anonymous. He received dozens of letters a day from women all over the world offering themselves in marriage. He liked women and they were attracted to him but he never married, despite a longstanding relationship with one of his secretaries, Irene Phillips, whose marriage he had broken up. According to his biographer, Williamson was probably &#145;the last of the great diamond pioneers&#146;  (Gawaine, viii). In this role he was arguably the only man in the twentieth century &#145;who discovered, developed and maintained from his own resources, without recourse to outside financial assistance, a diamond mine which was to assist in transforming the economy of a backward country and the lives of many people of diverse races&#146;  (ibid., vii). At the time of his death shares in Williamson Diamonds Limited numbered 1200, having been increased some years earlier. He held 800, his brother Percy had 300, and his partner I. C. Chopra had 100. After his death these shares were jointly purchased by De Beers Consolidated Mines and the Tanganyikan government for &pound;4,159,000. Production of diamonds at the mine in 1964 was worth over &pound;6 million.<br>
