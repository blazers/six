<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Francis</span>  (1563/4&#150;1638), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was born at Eaton Socon, Bedfordshire, the son of Peter White, who was first the curate and then vicar there. Nothing is known about his mother, but he had four brothers, who all became clergymen, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29252/', "John White (1570&#150;1615)")</script>. He attended the grammar school at St Neots, Huntingdonshire, and in 1579, at the age of fifteen, was admitted a pensioner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1583 and proceeded MA in 1586. He was ordained to the priesthood by the bishop of London on 17 May 1588. Early in his career White was rector of Broughton-Astley, Leicestershire, and it may have been during this period that he married; his wife's name is unknown. They had several daughters and at least one son, who may have been the Francis White baptized at Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, on 18 November 1612. <br>
<br>White subsequently became a lecturer at St Paul's, London, and from about 1617, thanks to his association with his patron, Richard Neile, bishop of Durham, and his growing reputation as an anti-Catholic polemicist, he began to rise rapidly in the church. He acknowledged Neile's patronage in <span class="italic">The Orthodoxe Faith and Way to the True Church</span>, essentially a defence of his brother John in the latter's controversy with the Catholic controversialist, and former president of Douai, Thomas Worthington. In May 1622, shortly after he was appointed dean of Carlisle, White was called upon by George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, to help persuade the duke's mother, Mary, countess of Buckingham, against converting to Catholicism. The countess had been under the influence of John Percy, better known as Fisher the Jesuit, who was secretly functioning as her chaplain at the court. White was asked to take the protestant side on the first day of three private debates with Percy organized by the marquess and King James and held in the presence of the Villiers family; the king and William Laud, bishop of St David's, took that role on the second and third days. When, against the king's wishes, Percy spread details of the debates in his <span class="italic">An Answere to a Pamphlet</span> (1623), White responded by publishing a formal attack on the Jesuit, entitled <span class="italic">A Replie to Jesuit Fishers Answere</span> (1624). In the meantime he had received his reward: on 27 September 1622 he was instituted rector of St Peter Cornhill, London. <br>
<br>White's publications surrounding the Percy conflict marked him as a principal spokesman for the growing group of so-called Arminians, whose views were often linked with the Dutch remonstrance theology of Jacobus Arminius (1560&#150;1609). Following the accession of Charles I many of these clerics rose to power in association with Neile, Villiers, who had become duke of Buckingham, and the future archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud. They all upheld the Roman church as a true, though errant, institution, questioned Calvinist opinions about predestination and the pope as the biblically predicted Anti-Christ, and gave greater place to the sacraments and ceremonies than to preaching in the worship service. White was usually one of the least contentious of this group, and his focus tended to be on separating essential matters of theology from those things he considered indifferent. He was most concerned to promote unity and conformity to the national church, and often railed against theological discord, claiming that when it rises, it &#145;overspreadeth the greene pastures of sacred truth&#146;. Nevertheless White demonstrated his commitment to the &#145;Laudian&#150;Arminian&#146; party when early in 1625 he helped license for publication Richard Montague's <span class="italic">Appello Caesarem</span>, which was openly anti-Calvinist and launched the biggest theological controversy of the late Jacobean period. In endorsing it, White went even further, &#145;associating Calvin with the most extreme exponents of absolute reprobation&#146;  (Milton, 428), a significant move away from his earlier, more moderate, stance, which required some mental gymnastics. With John Cosin, chaplain to Bishop Neile, White formally defended Montague's orthodoxy at the York House conference of February 1626. Here his critical stance on the canons issued by the Synod of Dort and his apparent shift from previously expressed positions earned him a sometimes uncomfortable ride. <br>
<br>White was rewarded, however, with further appointments in the church. Having become senior dean of Sion College, London, in 1625, he was consecrated bishop of Carlisle at Durham House on 3 December 1626 by bishops Neile, John Buckeridge, Theophilus Field, and William Murry. Cosin preached the consecration sermon to a crowd of over 500 people, including Buckingham's sister. For his episcopal visitation of 1627 White used articles previously prepared by Bishop John Overall for Norwich, &#145;which elevated the sacramental ministry of the priesthood, and enquired minutely into breaches of ceremony by the clergy and the reverence displayed by the laity during divine service&#146;  (Fincham, <span class="italic">Visitation Articles</span>, 1.xx). Following his election as bishop of Norwich in January 1629 he used a similar set for a visitation in 1631. Translated to Ely on 15 November that year, he did not, like bishops in neighbouring dioceses, enforce the railed altar, but his visitation of 1635 sought to establish uniformity of practice in catechizing and to curtail over-long sermons which resulted in the omission of parts of the liturgy. After Charles I reissued the controversial <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> in 1633 White was called upon to defend the crown on the issue of sabbatarianism and responded with <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Sabbath Day</span> (1635), dedicated to the new archbishop, William Laud. <br>
<br>White died at Ely House, Holborn, in February 1638 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. By his more Calvinist-inclined detractors White was considered someone who paid for his positions by renouncing orthodoxy. A note in Archbishop James Ussher's correspondence indicates that White &#145;sold his orthodoxe bookes and bought Jesuits&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). But up to his death White remained committed to a moderate form of protestantism rooted in a distaste for conflict and a concern to promote church unity by an emphasis on church ceremony and the physical &#145;beauty of holiness&#146;.<br>
