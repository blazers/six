<span class="headword">Cornhill,  Gervase  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1110&#150;1183/4), <span class="occ">royal official</span>, was probably the son and heir of the Roger, nephew of Hubert, who was sheriff of London in 1125, perhaps also in 1114&#150;15, and who died in 1130 or shortly before, probably on pilgrimage to Jerusalem; Roger's widow was Ingenolda. A thirteenth-century pedigree makes Gervase the son of one Hubert of Caen, but this seems less likely, in view of successive royal grants of the manor of Chalk, Kent, to Roger and to Gervase; however, it may well have been Hubert of Caen who was Roger's uncle. Gervase derived his surname, with, presumably, substantial property in London, from the family of his wife, Agnes, daughter of Edward of Cornhill, who had been a member of London's <i>cnihtengild</i>, an early association of eminent citizens. Though there is no direct evidence, there seems little doubt that Gervase himself, as well as his father and father-in-law, was a successful and rich London merchant, and the activities of his son <a href="#cosubject_52169">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a> suggest that he traded in cloth. William of Canterbury describes Gervase as &#145;thinking of his usurious two-thirds and hundredths rather than of what was good and right&#146;  (Robertson and Sheppard, 1.100); this is a hostile source, but his acquisition of lands in Gamlingay, Cambridgeshire, through a mortgage is also evidence that he did business as a moneylender.<br>
<br>Gervase was named as justice of London on a charter of between 1136 and 1147 and on the seal he was still using in the 1170s. In 1155&#150;7 and 1160&#150;61, and perhaps also 1159&#150;60, he was one of London's two sheriffs, and he was probably the Gervase who in 1174 presented a loyal address from the citizens to Henry II. He was sheriff of Surrey from 1163 until his death, and also of Kent from 1167 to 1174. In the latter role he was involved in the attempt to prevent Thomas Becket from landing at Sandwich in December 1170, allegedly at the instance of the archbishop of York and the bishops of London and Salisbury. From 1169 or 1170 to his death Gervase regularly served as an itinerant justice, in Devon as well as in Kent and Surrey.<br>
<br>Besides the properties in London, Chalk, and Gamlingay, Gervase acquired lands in Langham, Essex, and in Berkesden, Hertfordshire, both probably in the 1140s, and later held lands in East Horndon, Essex, and in Ashtead and elsewhere in Surrey. He quitclaimed property at Greenwich and Lewisham to St Peter's Abbey, Ghent, between 1161 and 1168, and granted his lands at Berkesden to Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, before 1154. He died between Michaelmas 1183 and Michaelmas 1184, leaving at least three sons: Henry; Ralph, sheriff of Kent (1191&#150;2) and Surrey (1191&#150;4), who married Alice, daughter and heir of Robert of Hastings, in or before 1191 and died in 1199 or 1200; and <a href="#cosubject_59536">Reginald [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52169"></a><span class="headword">Henry  of Cornhill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1135&#150;1192/3), <span class="occ">royal official</span>, was the eldest son of Gervase, and inherited his lands and, presumably, his business interests. By his marriage to Alice, daughter of William de Courcy, he acquired the barony of Stogursey and twenty-five and a quarter knights' fees mostly in Somerset, Dorset, Oxfordshire, and Northamptonshire. From 1175 at the latest he was employed by the king's household as an agent for buying cloth and other goods. He had custody of the escheated honours of Rayleigh (1181) and Boulogne (1183) and succeeded his father as sheriff of Surrey; he was also a sheriff of London in 1187&#150;9. Present at Henry II's death at Chinon, he was confirmed in his offices by Richard I and, in close attendance on the king in 1189&#150;90, had charge of preparing his fleet for the crusade, for which a special account was rendered in the exchequer. In 1190 he became sheriff of Kent, on paying 100 marks, and keeper of the exchange for all England except Winchester. Closely associated with the chancellor, William de Longchamp, he shared his downfall in October 1191 and was deprived of his offices. He died between Michaelmas 1192 and Michaelmas 1193, when his brothers answered for his debts in the exchequer. His daughter Joan, who married Hugh de Neville (<i>d</i>. 1234) in 1195 or soon after, was his sole heir; his widow married Warin Fitzgerald in or soon after 1193.<br>

<a name="cosubject_59536"></a><span class="headword">Reginald  of Cornhill</span>  (<em>c.</em>1140&#150;1209/10), <span class="occ">royal official</span>, was a younger son of Gervase, and on Henry's downfall he and his brother Ralph paid 100 marks to hold Henry's offices until the king's return to England; in 1192 he succeeded Ralph as sheriff of Kent and held the office for the rest of his life. Until his death he continued as a purchaser of goods&#151;luxury items rather than basic commodities&#151;for the king's household. He was responsible for assessing or collecting scutage (1199) and tallage (1200) in several counties, and, jointly, for the duty of one-fifteenth on imports and exports in 1203&#150;4, the recoinage of 1205, and the organization of the king's ships from 1205 to 1208, in which he worked with William of Wrotham (<i>d</i>. 1217). From 1201 onwards he served as a justice in many counties. He built up a substantial estate, especially in Kent, mostly by purchase. His wife is named in 1200 as Matilda; after his death, between Michaelmas 1209 and Michaelmas 1210, his son Reginald paid 10,000 marks to succeed as sheriff of Kent, and for his own and his father's debts.<br>
