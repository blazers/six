<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baring,  Maurice</span>  (1874&#150;1945), <span class="occ">poet and author</span>, was born at 37 Church Street, Mayfair, London, on 27 April 1874, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38281/', "Edward Charles Baring (1828&#150;1897)")</script>, who became first Baron Revelstoke, banker, and his wife, Louisa Emily Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of John Crocker Bulteel, of Flete and Lyneham, Devon, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11526/', "Charles Grey, second Earl Grey")</script>. Evelyn Baring, first earl of Cromer, was his uncle. Baring was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, but left the university without taking a degree. A genius for languages led him (1898) into the diplomatic service: he served as attach&eacute; in Paris, Copenhagen, and Rome, and also worked for a year at the Foreign Office in London. He resigned from the service in 1904. During his years spent <i>en poste</i> he formed several of the friendships which notably enriched his life, and many of the tastes, particularly in music and literature, which later composed the cultural background of his works. He went abroad again in 1904 as war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> in Manchuria, and remained, after the end of the Russo-Japanese War, as special correspondent for the same newspaper in St Petersburg. During these years he learned Russian and developed an abiding sympathy for the Russian people which political changes could not disturb. It was about this time that Baring's lifelong friendship with G. K. Chesterton began, and it has been suggested that Baring was the model for Horne Fisher, the connecting character of the stories that compose <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1922). In 1909 Baring went as correspondent to Constantinople and in 1912 he represented <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the Balkans. All this early period of Baring's life is admirably described in <span class="italic">The Puppet Show of Memory</span> (1922, repr. 1987) which remains a classic of autobiography. He there described the most important event of that period&#151;his reception into the Roman Catholic church&#151;as &#145;the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted&#146;.<br>
<br>Baring had already published a number of books when war broke out in 1914. Two plays, <span class="italic">The Black Prince</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Gaston de Foix</span> (1903), showed his double interest in history and the theatre, and also revealed a talent for the more traditional modes of verse. <span class="italic">Dead Letters</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Diminutive Dramas</span> (1911) revealed a lightly satiric humour playing on historic themes. Baring had also published his war memoirs, <span class="italic">With the Russians in Manchuria</span> (1905), and an excellent short account of Russian literature, <span class="italic">Landmarks in Russian Literature</span> (1910). Here he displayed for the first time his remarkable gifts as a translator. In later years he selected the poems included in <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Russian Verse</span> (1948). During the First World War he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps branch of the British expeditionary force, and for four years from August 1915 was &#145;mentor and guide&#146; to Hugh (later Viscount) Trenchard. He became a staff officer of the Royal Air Force in 1918, and was also appointed OBE in that year. His experiences during the First World War were recorded in <span class="italic">RFC HQ, 1914&#150;1918</span> (1920; new edn 1968, repr. 1985). His letters to Lady Juliet Duff, 1915&#150;18, were later published in <span class="italic">Dear Animated Bust</span> (1981). In 1925 Baring was given an honorary commission as wing commander in the Reserve of Air Force Officers; and in 1935 he was appointed officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He also became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Several of Baring's closest friends were killed during the war: Raymond Asquith, Patrick Houston Shaw-Stewart, Auberon Herbert, eighth Baron Lucas, and the Grenfell brothers, Julian and Gerald William. The death in action of these men inspired him to some moving verse, which he published in 1919. Meanwhile he was preparing his first novel, <span class="italic">Passing By</span> (1921). This showed, in miniature, all the characteristics which were to make <span class="italic">C</span> (1924, repr. 1986), <span class="italic">Cat's Cradle</span> (1925), and <span class="italic">Daphne Adeane</span> (1926) representative and popular novels of the same decade. Later, in such books as <span class="italic">The Lonely Lady of Dulwich</span> (1934), Baring returned to the shorter form of the <i>nouvelle</i>; and in <span class="italic">Robert Peckham</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">In my End is my Beginning</span> (1931), in which the story of Mary Stuart is told from the point of view of each of her four ladies-in-waiting, he returned to history for his subject. He also published in 1933 a short biography of Sarah Bernhardt, whom he had known and ardently admired.<br>
<br>In 1936 Baring was already suffering from paralysis agitans; the last book he was able to write was perhaps his most popular. <span class="italic">Have you Anything to Declare?</span> (1936), an anthology of favourite quotations in several languages, with translation and comments, showed his character as well as his culture, and revealed how intimately the two were allied. In 1940 he left his house and carefully tended garden at Rottingdean, and was looked after thenceforward by friends in Scotland. His house was destroyed by enemy action. Baring died, unmarried, at Beaufort Castle, Beauly, Inverness-shire, on 14 December 1945.<br>
<br>Baring's novels have come to be regarded as:<blockquote>minor masterpieces in character study and social depiction. Limited as they are in subject and theme &hellip; they can be appreciated for the accuracy with which they reproduce the world of the late Victorian &eacute;lite, for the purity and simplicity of their style, and for the sensitivity and erudition which they display. (Irvine, 34.8)</blockquote>
