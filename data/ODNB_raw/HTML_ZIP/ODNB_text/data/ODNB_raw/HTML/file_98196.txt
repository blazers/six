<span class="headword">Mokhehle,  Ntsu Clement</span>  (1918&#150;1999), <span class="occ">prime minister of Lesotho</span>, was born at Hamokhehle (&#145;Mokhehle's village&#146;), Berea district, Basutoland, on 26 December 1918, the fifth of ten children of Cicerone Mokhehle, a headman and school inspector, and his wife, Mosonngoa Motebang. He attended Anglican primary schools in Basutoland before being sent in 1935 to the Anglican secondary school at St Matthews in the eastern Cape, South Africa. In 1940 he entered another eastern Cape institution, the South African Native College, Fort Hare, a college set aside for black students, where he was a classmate of Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Robert Sobukwe, and Seretse Khama. An activist on campus, he was expelled for participating in a student strike in 1942. Readmitted in 1944, he graduated BSc in zoology. After teaching at Modderport in the Orange Free State to raise money for further studies, he returned to Fort Hare in 1946 to study for an MSc in zoology. His thesis, completed in 1947, was on the parasitology of flatworms. He also earned a university education diploma that qualified him for teaching positions.<br>
<br>As a young man Mokhehle was influenced in his political views by movements in both Basutoland and South Africa. As a teenager he was mentored by Josiel Lefela, the leader of Lekhotla la Bafo, a long-time Basotho anti-colonial movement. While a student at Fort Hare he joined the African National Congress (ANC) youth league. He participated in the ANC's 1949 national conference at Bloemfontein, which adopted the &#145;programme of action&#146; that committed the ANC to militant, non-violent protest.<br>
<br>After Mokhehle graduated from Fort Hare, British colonial officials, alarmed by his political activism, were reluctant to give him a teaching position in a government school in Basutoland. Thus, after graduation, he first taught at Ermelo in South Africa before returning to Basutoland in 1950, where he found a position at the higher primary school in Maseru. He married 'Maneo Kaloti in 1951 and had a son, Tseliso, and two daughters, Mosonngoa and Topollo.<br>
<br>Back in Basutoland Mokhehle became a leader of a number of organizations. In 1951 he was chosen as president of the Basutoland Sports Association. The following year he was elected head of the Basutoland National Teachers' Association and was a founder and first president of the Basutoland African Congress, which changed its name to the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) in 1959. After rejecting a demand by colonial officials that he could not keep his teaching position if he stayed in politics, he was dismissed as a teacher in 1954.<br>
<br>Mokhehle's BCP built up a strong base, especially among people who were educated and protestant and resided in the lowland areas of Basutoland. He was a strong advocate of quickly moving Basutoland to self-government, and criticized chieftainship and reforms proposed by the colonial administration. A staunch opponent of racial discrimination and of Basutoland being incorporated into the Union of South Africa (which was a proposal then much discussed), he also advocated an end to the apartheid system in South Africa. Although the ANC initially provided some financial support to his party, he broke with them to support the Pan-African Congress when it was founded in South Africa in 1959.<br>
<br>Although Mokhehle was not part of the Basotho delegation sent to London in 1958 to discuss constitutional changes with the British government, he went to London at the same time to lobby on the issues. A staunch pan-Africanist, on his way home he attended the All-African People's Convention in Ghana, where he met Ghana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, and Guinea's president, Sekou Tour&eacute;. The following year he travelled to west Africa to participate in protests against French nuclear tests in the Sahara. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he travelled even more widely, visiting Guinea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States. In 1962 he spoke at the United Nations decolonization committee in New York and called for Lesotho's independence.<br>
<br>The main outcome of the constitutional talks in 1958 had been the introduction of an eighty-member legislative council that included forty elected and forty appointed members. Mokhehle's primary political rival was Chief Leabua Jonathan, who established the Basutoland National Party in 1958 largely because of his opposition to what he perceived as the BCP's radical politics. In the first election for the legislative council in 1960, the BCP won a majority of the elected seats. Thus when in 1964 Mokhehle joined the Basutoland National Council's delegation to finalize constitutional talks with Britain, he did so as the leader of the largest grouping of elected legislative council members. However, in 1965, the Basutoland National Party won the next election. Thus when Lesotho gained its independence in October 1966 Jonathan became the first prime minister.<br>
<br>In the first post-independence election in 1970 Mokhehle's BCP was leading as results were coming in when Jonathan, claiming irregularities in voting, declared a state of emergency and nullified the election. That paved the way for political instability that lasted into the twenty-first century. Mokhehle was jailed after the election. After his release he tried negotiations with Jonathan, but once they failed, the BCP tried to organize a coup in 1974 which failed disastrously. Mokhehle was forced to flee into exile in Botswana, then Zambia. In the late 1970s the BCP formed a military wing, the Lesotho Liberation Army, which waged a low-level guerrilla war against Lesotho's government. Initially the South African government was opposed to the Lesotho Liberation Army, but as Jonathan's government entered into an alliance with the ANC and sought the support of socialist countries, Mokhehle began co-operating with South Africa, which allowed the Lesotho Liberation Army to stage operations from South African territory adjoining Lesotho.<br>
<br>In January 1986 Jonathan was overthrown by a military coup led by Major-General Justin Lekhanya. Several years later the military regime negotiated an agreement allowing all Basotho in exile, including Mokhehle, to return to Lesotho. Despite his declining health Mokhehle remained a widely popular figure in Lesotho, but he presided over a BCP split by factionalism. The military's plans for a return to civilian rule did not take place until junior military officers overthrew Lekhanya in April 1991 and began preparing the country for fresh elections in March 1993. Mokhehle's BCP won a sweeping victory, winning 75 per cent of the vote and all sixty parliamentary seats, and on 2 April 1993 Mokhehle was selected as prime minister. Despite his continuing personal popularity his years in office were marked by disputes within his own party and with other political parties and by unrest among Lesotho's military. He also had to contend with a civil service largely controlled by members of the Basutoland National Party.<br>
<br>On 17 August 1994 King Letsie III and the military overthrew Mokhehle's government, but after mediation from the Southern African Development Community, Mokhehle resumed his position as prime minister on 14 September. He headed the BCP until June 1997 when a rival faction won control of the party. That same month he led a breakaway to form the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD). Long weakened by heart ailments, he turned over leadership to Pakalitha Mosisili in February 1998, but remained prime minister. After the Lesotho Congress for Democracy easily won national elections, taking seventy-nine of eighty seats in parliament, he finally stepped down as prime minister on 29 May 1998. Opposition parties disputed the election results, and unrest and rioting followed. In September an army mutiny led to an intervention by troops from South Africa and Botswana under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community, which restored Mosisili as prime minister.<br>
<br>After a lengthy illness Mokhehle died of pneumonia on 6 January 1999 at a hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa. He was buried on 15 January at St Agnes's Anglican Church in Teyateyaneng, Lesotho.<br>
