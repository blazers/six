<span class="headword">Wilkes,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1805), <span class="occ">industrialist and entrepreneur</span>, was the fourth of nine children and second son of Joseph Wilkes (1698&#150;1769), grocer, of Overseal, Derbyshire, and Elizabeth, his wife (<i>d</i>. 1762). His grandfather was another Joseph Wilkes (1670&#150;1749), a nailer, of Barton under Needwood, Staffordshire, and Overseal. Wilkes was baptized at Seal church, Derbyshire, on 3 September 1733. Later, three of his brothers, John (1728&#150;1790), William (1737&#150;1781), and Thomas (1745&#150;1795), and one of his nephews, Joseph Pycroft (1758&#150;1833), were partners in his commercial, industrial, and banking enterprises.<br>
<br>Little is known of Joseph Wilkes's early life, but the family's prosperity increased in the mid-eighteenth century. This prompted a local tradition that at the time of the Jacobite rising in 1745, when the rebels penetrated as far south as Derby, one of the Wilkeses, possibly Joseph's father,<blockquote>purchased a barrel of nails which had been taken from his [Bonnie Prince Charlie's] adherents, and upon emptying it, found that the top and bottom only were nails, but the middle was all gold. Thus enriched [Joseph and Thomas Wilkes] became able to take part in or originate various schemes for the improvement of trade which shortly afterwards presented themselves. (Gresley, historical notes, Derbyshire RO, D809 A/PI 431)</blockquote>Wilkes married Elizabeth (known as Bessy) Wood (<i>d</i>. after 1774) at Seale on 11 September 1759. They had three surviving daughters. Joseph moved from Overseal to nearby Measham in Leicestershire about 1780.<br>
<br>Support for a transport network to open up markets was a lifelong interest of Joseph Wilkes. He and his brother John, both described as &#145;cheese factors&#146;, were partners in the new syndicate that obtained the lease after 1762 of the Trent Navigation which linked Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, with river and canal wharves throughout the region. New waterways made it economically viable to exploit local coal and ironstone seams, and in 1767 Joseph leased coal mines in Measham and Oakthorpe, Leicestershire, which included rights to dig clay. Brickmaking enabled Wilkes to prosper, but also later encouraged him to develop the innovation still characteristic of his local buildings, the production of double-sized bricks, popularly called &#145;Wilkes's gobs&#146;, to reduce liabilities under the brick tax introduced in 1785. Wilkes diversified into banking, founding in 1780 in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, the first bank outside the county town, together with similar businesses in Burton upon Trent, Measham, and his native Overseal.<br>
<br>Wilkes was linked in the 1760s with the Sampson Lloyds, senior and junior, ironmasters and later bankers of Birmingham; but his most significant business and financial partnership was from 1780 to 1798 with Robert &#145;Parsley&#146; Peel (1723&#150;1795) and his son Robert, first baronet (1750&#150;1830). The Peels' cotton-spinning mills in Burton upon Trent opened in 1780 and were followed ten years later by a large-scale textile complex at Fazeley in Staffordshire on a site purchased and developed by Wilkes and Peel, whose activities were further cemented by the formation of the new London and Tamworth bank of Peel, Wilkes, Dickenson, and Goodall.<br>
<br>Independently at Measham, Wilkes initiated an even greater transformation: in the 1780s he built two spinning mills, many weaving shops, large brickworks and limeworks, and an iron foundry where iron barges, steam-engine boilers, and other metal goods were produced. Local agriculture was improved, in part because water drained from Wilkes's coalmines was used for irrigation, and the town, largely rebuilt, became briefly an important business centre. Wilkes was an early but cautious investor in steam power, buying two Boulton and Watt engines for Measham corn and cotton mills, in 1786 and 1787 respectively; another winding engine, the first in the midland coalfield, for the Oakthorpe coal pit, in 1787; and in 1802 a fourth engine, at that time the largest in the region, for his original Measham corn mill. Coalmining in Brinsley near Nottingham and in Oakthorpe and Measham continued alongside Wilkes's other activities, and his last major project was to promote the Ashby Canal, completed in 1804, and its connection with the Coventry Canal near Bedworth in Warwickshire, and to open up coal markets further afield, not only for himself but also for neighbouring landowners.<br>
<br>Joseph Wilkes was a leading figure in a group of relatives and colleagues in the forefront of business innovation and development in and around south Derbyshire in the later eighteenth century. In addition to the Peels the group included William Wyatt (1701&#150;1773), estate steward and member of the Staffordshire family of architects; Nathaniel Curzon of Breedon on the Hill, Leicestershire; and the agricultural and livestock improver Robert Bakewell (1725&#150;1795), after whose death Joseph Wilkes became a founder and the first president of the Smithfield Cattle and Sheep Society in London. Where Wilkes differed from contemporaries was in the importance he gave to integrating industrial, commercial, agricultural, financial, and transport facilities to maximize potential markets.<br>
<br>An energetic and determined character, Wilkes was &#145;possessed of a strong, intelligent, original and active mind and, whatever he took in hand, was conducted with a spirit which overcame all obstacles&#146;  (Pitt, 185).<br>
<br>Over a period of forty years from the early 1760s he was a prime mover in the midlands in improving communication networks, opening up new markets, exploiting mineral resources, developing banking facilities, introducing new machinery, ameliorating land by drainage and water management, creating innovative building materials, and planning new large-scale manufacturing complexes. All this was achieved without the advantages of high social status or, apparently, a good education.<br>
<br>Joseph Wilkes moved to Croydon, Surrey, about 1804, and he died there in May 1805. Before his death he transferred his Derbyshire property to his widowed sister, Mrs Elizabeth Gresley (1735&#150;1816), and her children by her first marriage, Joseph and Elizabeth Pycroft.<br>
