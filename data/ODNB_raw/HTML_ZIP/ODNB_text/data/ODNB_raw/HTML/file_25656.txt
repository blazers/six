<span class="headword">Skeffington,  John</span>, second Viscount Massereene  (<em>bap. </em>1632, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was baptized on 27 December 1632, the eldest son of Sir Richard Skeffington (<i>d</i>. 1647) of Fisherwick, near Lichfield, and Anne Newdigate (1607&#150;1637). His father died in 1647 and in 1652 he succeeded his cousin as fourth baronet at the age of nineteen. As a substantial landowner in both Staffordshire and Warwickshire it was not long before Skeffington arranged a lucrative marriage, on 20 July 1654, to Mary, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5709/', "Sir John Clotworthy")</script> of co. Antrim, who later became first Viscount Massereene. It was his father-in-law's influence which secured him a seat in Richard Cromwell's 1659 parliament as MP for Antrim, Down, and Armagh. He was also elected MP for co. Antrim in the Irish parliament of 1661.<br>
<br>By the death of his father-in-law in 1665, Skeffington became Viscount Massereene and baron of Loughneagh by special remainder and succeeded to a great Irish estate in his wife's right. Thereafter he extended his political influence, as <i>custos rotulorum</i> of co. Londonderry (from 1666) and an Irish privy councillor (from 1667). He was also able to secure compensation for lands lost by the Clotworthys at the Restoration. His support for presbyterianism, however, brought him into conflict with the duke of Ormond by the 1670s, and his involvement in the exclusion crisis caused Ormond to target his local power base. The tightening of restrictions against nonconformist JPs and militia officers after the exclusion crisis was partly aimed at Massereene, and in 1682 the earl of Arran announced his intention &#145;to turn out of all employments the peer himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 6.375). In 1683 Ormond threatened to remove Massereene from the privy council, and presented him for nonconformity.<br>
<br>Despite fears of James II's intentions after 1685, Massereene was nevertheless reappointed to his governorship and sworn of the privy council. But it was not long before he was actively supporting a Williamite invasion. When the citizens of Londonderry determined to stand on their defence Massereene helped them with a large sum of money. He was one of those to whom the Enniskilleners specially appealed for help; it was at Antrim Castle that the protestants of the county met under Massereene's presidency, and his only surviving son, Clotworthy, was chosen to command them in the field. Massereene himself withdrew to England soon afterwards. In Tyrconnel's proclamation of 7 March 1689 both father and son were among the ten persons excepted by name from mercy as &#145;principal actors in the rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, old ser., 2.396).<br>
<br>Massereene was in London in November 1689, being one of the Irish committee chosen to confer with William III. He returned to Ireland after the battle of the Boyne, and resumed his seat on the privy council, sat in the parliament which met on 5 October 1692, and was active in the business of the House of Lords. He died on 21 June 1695 and was buried at Antrim. Clotworthy succeeded him as third viscount, and was ancestor of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25655/', "Clotworthy Skeffington, second earl of Massereene")</script>. Of Massereene's three daughters, the youngest, Mary, married Edward Smyth, bishop of Down and Connor.<br>
