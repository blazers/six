<span class="headword">Faulkner, Sir  Arthur Brooke</span>  (1779&#150;1847), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was the fourth and youngest son of Hugh Faulkner (1733&#150;1801), of Wellbroke and Seville Park, co. Tyrone, and Castletown, co. Carlow, Ireland, and Florence (<i>d</i>. 1792), daughter of the Revd Henry Cole of Brookfield, co. Fermanagh, and niece of the first Baron Mount Florence. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1795, and in due course graduated BA, having studied chemistry and anatomy. He then became a medical student at Edinburgh University, graduating MD in 1803. His next two years were spent in London as a student at the London Hospital, the Westminster Hospital, and the Surrey Dispensary. In 1805 he was incorporated BA of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, by virtue of his Dublin degree, and MA the same year; his Cambridge MA served to procure him the <i>ad eundem</i> degree at Trinity College; and finally he used this Dublin MA to get incorporated as BM and MD of Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1806. In 1807 he became a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and was elected fellow in 1808. In 1810 he married Anne, daughter of Mr Donald McLeod or M'Leod of Lewes, Sussex.<br>
<br>Faulkner was appointed physician to the forces and served on the staff in Spain, the Netherlands, Sicily, and Malta. In 1810 he published <span class="italic">Considerations on the Expediency of Establishing an Hospital for Officers on Foreign Service</span>. He was at Malta when the plague was introduced there in 1813 (after an interval of 140 years) by a vessel from Alexandria; he distinguished himself by tracing the spread of the disease, by his vigorous advocacy of the doctrine of contagion, and by directing the quarantine procedure whereby the disease was kept within bounds. He retired from the service in 1815 and, returning to England, was knighted in February 1815 and appointed physician to the duke of Sussex. He communicated his experiences of plague to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span> (April 1814), gave evidence in favour of its contagiousness before the House of Commons committee in 1819, and published a full account of the Malta outbreak in 1820 in a <span class="italic">Treatise on the Plague</span>.<br>
<br>Faulkner was also a writer on non-medical subjects. <span class="italic">Rambling Notes and Reflections</span> (1827) described a visit to France; <span class="italic">Visit to Germany and the Low Countries</span> (2 vols., 1833) was his second book; and <span class="italic">Letters to Lord Brougham</span> (1837) described a visit to Italy. Faulkner freely admitted that these works were as much about affairs in Britain as his travels abroad, and he continued his reforming drive in pamphlets (published 1828&#150;40), in which he argued for reform of the church, the universities, and the Royal College of Physicians, appearing to deprecate, among other things, the ingenious way in which he had acquired his degrees.<br>
<br>Faulkner settled as a physician at Cheltenham, and died, childless, at his residence at Evington, near Cheltenham, on 19 January 1847.<br>
