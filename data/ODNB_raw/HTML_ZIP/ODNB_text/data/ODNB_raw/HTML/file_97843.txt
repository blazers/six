<span class="headword">Middlemore, Sir  John Throgmorton</span>, first baronet  (1844&#150;1924), <span class="occ">social reformer and politician</span>, was born in Weoley Park Road, Birmingham, on 9 June 1844, the fourth son in the family of thirteen children of William Middlemore (1802&#150;1887), leather merchant, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Groom (1808&#150;1892). His father, a Baptist, was a prominent Birmingham businessman, who owned a large saddlery and was active in the town's Liberal and nonconformist politics; elected one of the original Birmingham councillors in 1839, he was a vice-president of the Reform Union (1858) and a founder of the Birmingham Liberal Association (1865).<br>
<br>Middlemore was educated at the progressive Edgbaston Propriety School by Dr Charles Badham. As a young man, he was sent to America to study at the Medical School of Maine in Brunswick and graduated with a diploma in medicine, but he never practised. He was baptized at the Congregational chapel in Portland, Maine, in 1867. On his return to Birmingham, he worked in the family business and married, on 25 September 1878, Marion, the daughter of Richard Bagnall, of Severn Stoke. She died shortly after the birth of a daughter in 1879. He married, second, on 29 December 1881, Mary (1863&#150;1935), daughter of Thomas Price, vicar of Selly Oak. They had a further nine children, eight girls and one boy. He lived for most of his married life at Brookfield House, Belbroughton, Worcestershire, and became director of a patent enamelware company based in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Middlemore was an admirer of Charles Dickens and Dr Barnado and, through his religious faith and his friendship with Sir Josiah Mason, he was inspired to address the problem of child poverty in Birmingham. Having seen conditions in America, he believed that prospects of destitute children, described as &#145;street arabs&#146; or &#145;waifs and strays&#146; and thought to be living on the margins of criminality, would be significantly improved if they could be removed to adopted families in Canada. With the support of the Cadbury family, Middlemore founded the Children's Emigration Home for Boys, on St Luke's Road, Birmingham, in September 1872 and the smaller Children's Emigration Home for Girls on Spring Road in December 1872. The aim of the homes was later described as being<blockquote>to save boys and girls from lives of crime and pauperism. The principle adopted for this end is that of permanently removing them from criminal and pauper surroundings and transferring them by means of emigration to entirely different and hopeful associations. (25th Annual Report of the Children's Emigration Homes, 1897, Birm. CL, MS 517)</blockquote>Parents or guardians (if they could be traced) had to give permission for the child to emigrate before a child could be taken into the homes.Middlemore took twenty-nine children (thirteen girls and sixteen boys) to Canada with him on 1 May 1873 and took subsequent groups of between 70 and 120 children at least once every year until 1883. After this, he employed an agent to lead the parties to Canada. The first party of children were placed with families in Toronto and London, Ontario, where a receiving home was established in 1875. Parties of children were also taken by Middlemore to Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Maine, and Prince Edward Island. Most children who emigrated were between five and fifteen years of age. Initially, Middlemore, with financial help from his father, ran the scheme privately, but subsequently a management committee was constituted, and funds raised from the public, though Middlemore remained the chief supporter.<br>
<br>As the scheme developed, local police courts frequently made orders for children to be sent to Middlemore's establishments in the face of opposition from parents or guardians. In these cases, as in the cases of those deemed physically or mentally unsuited to emigration, children were rehoused in Britain. By 1891, 1963 children had emigrated and by 1932, when the job of settlement was handed over to the Fairbridge Society in British Columbia, over 5000 children had emigrated. General criticisms of child emigration to Canada had been voiced since the report of an investigator sent there by the Local Government Board in 1874. Middlemore's own scheme was criticized by the immigration agent in Halifax in 1894 for failing to take adequate care in choosing homes, and not keeping records of where the children were placed. In 1901 Middlemore answered his critics by pointing out that all families receiving children had to sign an agreement to treat the emigrants as if they were their own children. The history of child emigration remained controversial in Canada where accusations were made in the late twentieth century that Middlemore children were exploited, abused, or discriminated against.<br>
<br>Middlemore was a member of Birmingham council, representing Nechells ward from 1883 to 1892. His political trajectory followed that of most Birmingham Liberal politicians: inspired by the moral leadership of John Bright, the campaigning of those such as George Dixon and Jesse Collings and most of all the political leadership of Joseph Chamberlain, Middlemore, along with Joseph Powell Williams and William Kenrick and most local councillors, followed them in 1886 into the National Radical Union and later the National Liberal Union and finally the Midland Liberal Unionist Association. He was elected unopposed as Liberal Unionist MP for North Birmingham, in succession to William Kenrick, brother-in-law of Joseph Chamberlain, at a by-election on 14 February 1899. Middlemore was returned unopposed at the general elections of 1900 and December 1910, and defeated Liberal opponents in 1906 and January 1910. His tenure in parliament coincided with the period when the Liberal Unionist Party central administration merged with the Conservative Party, except in Birmingham, where the two remained separate until 1918. He spoke little in the House of Commons except on naval questions, in which he was influenced by his friendship with the Liberal Unionist minister of war H. O. Arnold-Forster. Convinced of the inevitability of conflict with Germany, he strongly supported the Navy League's campaign for a considerable reinforcement of the Home Fleet. In December 1918 Middlemore announced his retirement from parliament, owing to ill health and the imminent abolition of the constituency as a result of boundary changes. He received a baronetcy in May 1919.<br>
<br>Middlemore mixed freely with intellectuals and artists such as Leonard Huxley and Holman Hunt. He donated a number of major Pre-Raphaelite works to Birmingham City Art Gallery by artists such as Hunt, Madox Brown, G. F. Watts, and Burne-Jones. He died at his home, Woodside, Lark Hill, Worcestershire, on 17 October 1924 and was buried in Belbroughton churchyard. On his death, the homes were renamed &#145;the Middlemore Emigration Homes&#146;. In 1945 the organization ceased to send children abroad and the organization focused on providing care homes for children, after the model created by Dr Barnardo.<br>
