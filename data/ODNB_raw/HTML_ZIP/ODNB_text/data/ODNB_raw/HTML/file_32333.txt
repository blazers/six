<span class="headword">Cawood, Sir  Walter</span>  (1907&#150;1967), <span class="occ">chemist and civil servant</span>, was born on 28 April 1907 in York, the son of Walter Cawood, civil servant, of New Earswick, York, and his wife, Elizabeth McSall, the daughter of a Lincolnshire farmer. He had one sister. He was educated at Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School, York, and at the University of Leeds, where he took his PhD degree in chemistry (1932), having obtained an external BSc from London in 1929. He was a Ramsey memorial fellow (1931&#150;3), and a Moseley scholar of the Royal Society (1933&#150;8). His early research was concerned with the properties of aerosols and the theory of coagulation, and he always maintained an interest in physical chemistry. In 1934 he married Molly, daughter of Fred Johnson, a schoolmaster of York. They had one son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1938 Cawood joined the Air Ministry, working with a team investigating chemical warfare. This involved him in the design of proximity fuses but, from 1942, his most valuable work was in instrumentation. He was responsible for the development of bomb and torpedo sights and for synthetic training aids, particularly for night flying. He improvised a simple pre-set rangefinder for use in aircraft attacking the V1 flying bomb, and to improve this device flew in operations as an honorary wing commander.<br>
<br>Cawood was deputy director at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, from 1947 to 1953 and during this time he acquired his interest in aviation and avionics. From 1953 to 1959 he was at the headquarters of the Ministry of Aviation, where he was responsible for the aeronautical research programme. In 1954 he enthusiastically supported the creation of the Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development, which did much to restore European aeronautical collaboration. During the group's early years he served as national delegate.<br>
<br>Cawood was a scientist who believed in identifying the few important growth points from a wide range of promising alternatives, and single-mindedly supporting them. He foresaw the potential of vertical take-off and as early as 1958 provided support for Sir Sydney Camm's deflected thrust aircraft, the forerunner of the Harrier jump jet, which later served with the Royal Air Force. He understood the need to supplement wind-tunnel measurements with actual flight trials. He encouraged the investigation of light weight-lifting engines in experimental aircraft, and of low-speed handling properties of slender wings which did so much to validate the design of the revolutionary supersonic passenger aircraft Concorde.<br>
<br>In 1959 Cawood became the first chief scientist of the War Office and later, in 1964, the first scientist to be a member of the army board. His wide experience in rationalizing research and development was invaluable in unifying the various scientific and engineering organizations within the War Office, and in building up relationships between scientists and their military colleagues. His knowledge of aviation technology was particularly useful to the army, which was beginning to invest in helicopters and air transportability, and his training as a chemist found application in the affairs of the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton and the ordnance factories.<br>
<br>In 1964 Cawood returned to the Ministry of Aviation as chief scientist and became involved in the integration of the Ministry of Aviation into the new Ministry of Technology. His particular concern was to extend the mandate of the defence establishments so that their resources would be more directly available to civil industry. He suffered poor health during his last year, but continued to carry his heavy responsibilities. He died at the Cambridge Military Hospital in Aldershot on 6 March 1967, survived by his widow.<br>
<br>Cawood was an enthusiastic yachtsman and crewed in many offshore races as well as sailing single-handed in his own boat, <i>Cobber</i>. He was an active member of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, of the Royal Southern Yacht Club, and of the Royal Aeronautical Society, of which he was a fellow. He was appointed CBE in 1953, CB in 1956, and KBE in 1965.<br>
