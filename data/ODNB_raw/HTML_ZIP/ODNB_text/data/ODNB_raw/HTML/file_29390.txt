<span class="headword">Wilcox,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1549&#150;1608), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded in 1564, when he matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, suggesting that he was born about 1549; much later in his career he was listed in a formal ecclesiastical document as a non-graduate. He became one of the preachers entertained in the peculiar London parish (in both the formal and informal senses) of Holy Trinity Minories, and he served the cure of All Hallows, Honey Lane. Towards 1570 he became part of a militant tendency of younger London preachers, led by John Field, curate of St Giles Cripplegate. In an attack published in 1581 against a certain I.B., a &#145;libertine&#146;, or freewiller, he would own the designation of &#145;Puritan&#146; even while repudiating it, &#145;a worde of a doubtfull signification&#146;, attributing its invention to the Catholic exile Nicholas Sander  (Wilcox, <span class="italic">The Unfouldyng of Sundry Untruthes</span>, 80&#150;83).<br>
<br>In 1571 Wilcox had joined with another radical spirit, William White, in replying to attacks on the nonconformists made in Paul's Cross sermons by bishops John Jewel and Robert Horne. Jewel was told that they would pray that God would put it into the queen's heart to remove Jewel from his &#145;over quiet estate, pompous livings and lordly titles&#146;  (Peel, 1.79&#150;80). In June 1572 Field and Wilcox wrote and published, anonymously, the outspoken presbyterian manifesto <span class="italic">An Admonition to the Parliament</span>. The <span class="italic">Admonition</span> proper, relatively measured and carefully structured in its argument, was the work of Wilcox, the more heated and satirically inventive <span class="italic">View of Popishe Abuses</span> which accompanied it Field's handiwork. So much is clear from exchanges with Archbishop Parker's chaplain, when Wilcox disowned responsibility for &#145;the bitternes of the stile&#146;, which Field freely acknowledged  (Peel, 1.89&#150;90). Both were imprisoned on the authority of the archbishop. The admonitioners became famous overnight and were visited by many of the leading nonconformist clergy, which is not to say that their extreme views were universally approved. After three months Field and Wilcox were sentenced by the lord mayor and aldermen to a further year's imprisonment in Newgate, which, in spite of petitions to the privy council, Lord Burghley, and the earl of Leicester from themselves and their impoverished wives, they appear to have served. At an appearance before the privy council in the summer of 1573 they were threatened with banishment. Bishop Edwin Sandys of London, who suffered much opprobium on their account, complained that London would never be quiet until &#145;these authors of sedition who are now esteemed as gods&#146; were removed far from the city. &#145;The people resort unto them as in Popery they were wont to run on pilgrimage&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 17, no. 43, fols. 96&#150;7). Eventually the pair were released into the care of Archdeacon John Mullins. In the autumn of 1573 Wilcox went off on a tour of puritan centres in the midlands, but by February 1574 he was back in London, replacing Field, who was now perhaps overseas, as the regular correspondent of &#145;Father&#146; Anthony Gilby at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, reporting from his house in Coleman Street the latest oppressions of the bishops.<br>
<br>John Field always took the upper hand in his dealings with Wilcox. In December 1572 both men had composed &#145;a breife confession of Faythe&#146;, which, if wisdom had not prevailed, they would have attempted to promulgate as a formal affirmation by the entire presbyterian movement, an intrinsically schismatic gesture. &#145;Brother Wilcox&#146; seems to have acted on Field's instructions, which ended: &#145;Studie to be breife&#146;  (Peel, 1.83&#150;4). But in 1583 the relationship turned sour. This is revealed by some correspondence that fell into the hands of Richard Bancroft, and which he exploited in 1593 in his book <span class="italic">Daungerous Positions</span>. The letters in Bancroft's hands may have mentioned the particulars of the offence, but the future archbishop, with his unfailing tabloid instincts, thought it not fit to rehearse &#145;any mans private behaviour or infirmities&#146;, leaving the prurient reader to suspect the worst. But it does sound as if the transgression was moral rather than theological or professional. For his part, Wilcox told Field that he had been dealt with &#145;disorderly&#146;, and hinted that &#145;hee had perhaps concealed as great infirmities of Fields&#146;, specifying six. Field retorted: &#145;If God hath made you an instrument, to seeke for the advancement of Christs scepter: kisse it your selfe and bee subject unto it.&#146; It was the private opinion of Tomson and Thomas Cartwright that Wilcox should be &#145;for ever&#146; suspended from his ministry  (Bancroft, 117&#150;19). It is perhaps significant that Wilcox in many of his writings was somewhat over-zealous in declaring himself a sinner, making much of &#145;the grievousnes of mine offences&#146;  (Wilcox, <span class="italic">Summarie and Short Meditations</span>, epistle). No less than six of his dedicatory prefaces and many of his letters were subscribed: &#145;Thomas Wilcocks [or &#147;T.W.&#148;] the Lordes unworthie [or &#147;most unworthie&#148;] servant [or &#147;minister&#148;]&#146;, in effect his trademark.<br>
<br>In 1577 a new bishop of London, John Aylmer, had recommended that Wilcox and others be sent off to Lancashire, to wear out their zeal on the papists. However, Wilcox had already moved, but only as far as Hertfordshire, where he became curate of Bovingdon, a chapelry of Hemel Hempstead. In 1584 he was one of five clergy in the archdeaconry of Huntingdon, &#145;recusants&#146;, who evaded subscription to Archbishop Whitgift's three articles. He neither appeared nor subscribed, but was presumably protected by some of the many powerful friends whom he had by now acquired. Soon after this Wilcox was reported as attending a presbyterian conference in Oxford, which included some of the Scottish ministers then in exile in England. In March 1596 &#145;T.W.&#146;, who may have been Wilcox, preached in a combination lecture or prophesying at Southwell in Nottinghamshire, but his presence so far from his usual haunts is not otherwise accounted for. Aylmer and his successors were not entirely rid of Wilcox's presence. He signed prefaces to published works from London in 1581, 1587, 1591, 1595, 1599, 1600 (giving his address as Lothbury), and 1604.<br>
<br>In spite of his own alleged &#145;infirmity&#146;, or even because of it, Wilcox became one of the most sought after of puritan casuists, a pioneer in the art of &#145;practical&#146; or &#145;comfortable&#146; divinity. Long after his death he would receive the tribute of a volume of collected <span class="italic">Works</span> (1624), something which never happened to Field. In 1589 he published <span class="italic">Large Letters, Three in Number</span>, dedicated to eight named London citizens &#145;and all the rest of his Christian acquaintance in London&#146;. Many more of his pastoral letters survived in manuscript in a large folio volume until the late seventeenth century, when they were listed by the dissenting divine Roger Morrice: &#145;most of them containing little but godly, plain and necessary exhortations and directions for the exercise of godlynesse&#146;  (Morrice MSS, &#145;Letters of eminent persons&#146;, 2.617(2)), although a letter written to the countess of Sussex on 24 February 1577 asked her to use her influence at court on behalf of the silenced puritan ministers, himself included.<br>
<br>Wilcox was one of the most committed, active, and socially and politically well connected of Elizabethan puritan ministers, and the tally of his correspondents reads like an Elizabethan <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. It includes Sir Francis Walsingham and his wife, Fulke Greville (&#145;several&#146; letters), the MP Peter Wentworth, Lady Anne Bacon, the wife of the clerk of the council, Robert Beale, Lord and Lady Zouche, and Sir Richard Knightley's sister and Sir John Harington's mother-in-law, Lady Rogers. Most of these letters were written in 1577&#150;8. Wilcox's dedicatory epistles are distinctive for their emphasis on Christian friendship. His particular patrons, besides many wealthy Londoners, were Martin Harlackinden of Woodchurch, Kent, the recipient of scores of letters, who at his death in 1585 left Wilcox and his wife, Annah, an annuity for life of &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., plus &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. for their son, Elijah; the third earl of Bedford and his wife, Lucy, the great patroness of poets, described as his &#145;very Christian friends&#146;  (Amandus Polanus, preface, <span class="italic">Substance of Christian Religion</span>, trans. T. Wilcox, 1600); and Lady Anne Bacon. He dedicated his <span class="italic">Discourse Touching the Doctrine of Doubting</span> (1598) to the Bedfords and the countess's brother Sir John Harington (later Lord Harington of Exton) and his wife from Woburn, and in 1595 published a moralized account of &#145;a fearefull fire&#146; at Woburn  (Wilcox, <span class="italic">A Short yet a True and Faithfull Narration</span>). Other books, written or translated by Wilcox, were dedicated to Sir Francis and Lady Walsingham, Sir John Popham, Sir William Pelham, Sir John Brocket, Sir John Cutts, and Sir Charles Morison.<br>
<br>In 1604 Wilcox presented the ten-year-old Prince Henry with Philippe de Mornay's <span class="italic">A Woorke Concerning the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion</span>, his revision of a translation begun by Sir Philip Sidney and completed by Arthur Golding. The dedication included a fulsome declaration of loyalty to &#145;your most loving father, and my only dear and dred Soveraigne and gracious Lord and Master, here upon earth&#146;. There is evidence that Wilcox had acted as some kind of intermediary between the English puritan interest and James at about the time of his accession. Later he was one of the ministers who met behind the scenes at the Hampton Court conference in 1604, in order to brief the four principal puritan spokesmen.<br>
<br>Wilcox seems to have spent much time at Gorhambury as a chaplain and pensioner of Lady Anne Bacon. A servant of Anthony Bacon reported on one occasion that &#145;Mr Willockes had a paper with a grete delle of gould in it&#146;  (LPL, MS 650, no. 169). There is strong internal evidence that the puritan archives published in 1593 as <span class="italic">A Parte of a Register</span> and the larger manuscript collections known as &#145;The seconde parte of a register&#146;, an enterprise begun by John Field, were assembled by Wilcox, and perhaps at Gorhambury. An item in &#145;The seconde parte&#146;, the account of the interrogation in 1572 of Field and Wilcox by Andrew Pearson, Archbishop Parker's chaplain, was written up by Wilcox after Field's death in 1588.<br>
<br>Wilcox wrote or translated some twenty-five books (if various publications attributed to &#145;T.W.&#146; are all his). Some of his <span class="italic">Works</span> were posthumously published in 1624 by the staunchly puritan divine and physician Dr John Burges, who had married Wilcox's eldest daughter, Sara, in 1621. It was a daughter of Burges's first marriage who married the celebrated puritan divine William Ames.<br>
