<span class="headword">St Martin,  Laurence  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1274), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, is first recorded in the early 1240s, when he is already styled <i>magister</i> and described as a royal clerk. Of his family origins and background little can be said, except that he was probably connected with the Wiltshire St Martins; and two of his brothers are found in association with him, Abel as his proctor in 1245 and William as archdeacon of Rochester from 1253.<br>
<br>St Martin probably began his career in the household of William de Valence, Henry III's half-brother, but in 1244 he became one of the king's chief advisers in ecclesiastical affairs, and as such was a member of the English delegation at the Council of Lyons in 1245. In his absence the king provided him with a prebend in Chichester Cathedral and collated him to the archdeaconry of Coventry during the vacancies of those sees; a prebend at Salisbury soon followed when that see, too, came into the king's hands in 1246. Then, on 19 October 1250, while St Martin was engaged on a diplomatic mission at the papal court, he was elected bishop of Rochester in succession to Richard Wendene. According to Matthew Paris, the king's influence was brought to bear upon the monastic chapter, but the monks' choice was probably also affected by the fact that the prior, Alexander de Glanville, was a close friend of St Martin, &#145;quem idem Alexander unice diligebat&#146;, in the words of the <span class="italic">Annales ecclesiae Roffensis</span>  (<span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, 2.369). Archiepiscopal confirmation took place at Lyons on 9 February 1251, after the bishop-elect had there voiced his reluctance to give his homage to Canterbury, on the grounds that it might be construed as a slight upon the royal prerogative. His hesitation having been overcome by a statement issued by Archbishop Boniface that guaranteed the safeguarding of the king's rights, he made his profession and was consecrated by the archbishop at Lyons on Palm Sunday, 9 April 1251.<br>
<br>Two controversies for a time marred the new bishop's relations with his cathedral chapter and brought him into conflict with the see of Canterbury and with the crown. The monks protested against what they judged to be his interference in appointments to offices within the priory, and his claim to some of their manorial properties, which had the result, so the annalist reports, that the disillusioned prior fell ill and died. Disagreement with the archbishop and, indirectly, with the king arose when Henry III demanded payment of a feudal aid on the occasion of the knighting of his eldest son. St Martin's unease in this instance was based on the fact that his temporalities were held not of the king but of the archbishop as confirmed by King John's charter, which the bishop understood to have been a gift in free alms exempt from all secular dues and services. After lengthy discussions in the king's council and in parliament, and an appeal to the pope launched against the king's wishes, a settlement was agreed on 1 August 1259. This defined the rights and obligations of each to the other: the bishop was henceforth to have the return of all royal writs and pleas within his church and see, and the archbishop an annual payment of 12 marks for this concession.<br>
<br>St Martin's elevation to the episcopate did not bring an end to his employment in the royal service; he continued to make journeys to Rome and elsewhere as an envoy for both church and crown. In 1256, for example, he procured the canonization of an unfortunate Scot, William of Perth, murdered near Rochester on his way to the Holy Land; the offerings at the shrine of this new saint enabled the grateful monks to rebuild the choir of their cathedral church. He played no active part in the civil wars of the 1260s, but continued to be associated with the king; the sack of Rochester in 1264 was said to have been an act of revenge by the barons against the bishop. In 1268 St Martin was once more a royal envoy to Italy, dealing with Henry's remaining family interests in Sicily. He may have attended the opening session of the second Council of Lyons in May 1274, but he died about 3 June, and was buried in his cathedral on the north side of the high altar, in a tomb of Purbeck marble which boasts a fine effigy and canopy above.<br>
<br>As diocesan St Martin was greatly concerned to augment his own revenues, claiming that his see was the poorest in England. In 1251 he secured the pope's consent to his retaining for three years the benefices that he had held before he became bishop, and he also obtained papal licence to take for five years a fifth of the revenues of all the benefices in his diocese. To the same end he appropriated three churches to the bishop's endowment. In 1252 he conducted an inquest into the finances of Rochester Cathedral priory. But he achieved little. The priory's affairs remained in disorder, while the bishop's executor John de St Dionisius, archdeacon of Rochester by 1278, was at that date still pursuing the bishop's many debtors. St Martin's concern for administrative efficiency may also be apparent in his having kept an episcopal register. It was still available for consultation in 1347, but ultimately did not survive. However, two volumes of the writings of St Augustine and a &#145;Flores historii&#146;, all given by him to the Rochester monks, have survived in the British Library as Royal MSS 2 F. xi, 5 A. xv, and 5 B. vi.<br>
