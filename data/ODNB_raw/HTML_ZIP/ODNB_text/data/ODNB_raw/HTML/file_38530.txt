<span class="headword">Playne,  Caroline Elizabeth</span>  (1857&#150;1948), <span class="occ">pacifist and historian</span>, was born at Forest Green, Avening, Gloucestershire, on 2 May 1857, one of two daughters of George Frederick Playne (1824&#150;1879), Gloucestershire cloth manufacturer and fellow of the Geographical Society, and his Dutch wife, Margarettia Sara, the daughter of I. G. J. van den Bosch. Her mother tongue was Dutch. There is uncertainty about much of Caroline Playne's life; in 1881, after her father's death, she was living with her mother in Hampstead, London. Although there is no record of her having studied at a British university, she was elected an associate member of the University Women's Club in 1908 as a woman &#145;in the pursuit of arts, science or literature&#146;. By that time she had published two novels, <span class="italic">The Romance of a Lonely Woman</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">The Terror of the Macdurghotts</span> (1907), and had published a paper, &#145;The evolution of international peace&#146;, countering the aggressive social Darwinism of her day with the internationalism of Grotius, Kant, Kropotkin, L. T. Hobhouse, and Tolstoy, which she had read to the Anglo-Russian Literary Society. Her later work demonstrates that she was also very widely read in French and German.<br>
<br>Unusually among her contemporaries, Caroline Playne was one of the few women, such as Violet Paget (Vernon Lee), Kate, Lady Courtney of Penwith, and Sophia Sturge, who were alert, long before 1914, to the danger of an imminent, cataclysmic European war. Already by about 1904 she had become a founder member of Britain's National Peace Council supporting the recently founded international court at The Hague and in 1908 she attended the International Peace Congress in London attended by Bertha von Suttner, whose biographer she later became. When the First World War finally broke out, Caroline Playne was devastated. She immediately joined the Emergency Committee for the Relief of Distressed Enemy Aliens (Germans trapped in Britain); she joined E. D. Morel's Union for the Democratic Control of Foreign Policy; she worked for the Nailsworth Peace Association and the National Peace Council that was then arranging a postal service for personal correspondence between the belligerent countries and was also trying to trace missing persons; she translated and published articles from the <span class="italic">Berliner Tageblatt</span> that praised Quaker relief efforts for German internees and prisoners of war; she collected suppressed pacifist pamphlets; and she also kept private notes of the constant war propaganda in the British press and a private diary of the war years.<br>
<br>The fruit of that &#145;internal exile&#146; of 1914&#150;18 was Caroline Playne's extraordinary pioneering work in cultural history and social psychology in the 1920s and 1930s. Although she was by then in her sixties and seventies, and might have been excused for longing to retire from &#145;this vile world&#146;, she forced herself to relive in spirit both the ominous pre-war years and the death-intoxicated First World War itself. Her aim was to demonstrate and analyse the preconditions for irrational, righteous mass slaughter, hoping that she might thereby inoculate German, French, and British readers against being quite so vulnerable to mass media propaganda again. Her <span class="italic">Neuroses of the Nations</span> (1925) focused on Germany and France and their &#145;group-insanities&#146; as mirrored in their idea of their own history and their popular culture. She followed this with <span class="italic">The Pre-War Mind in Britain</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Society and War, 1914&#150;16</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Britain Holds on, 1917, 1918</span>, (1933). Finally, in 1936, she published <span class="italic">Bertha von Suttner and the Struggle to Avert the World War</span>.<br>
<br>Caroline Playne analysed not just the popular press but also the drama, fiction, history writing, popular science, and political speeches of pre-war Europe, as she mapped how &#145;exaggerated nationalism, chauvinism and militarism &hellip; seized hold of the public mind with disastrous consequences&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Pre-War Mind in Britain</span>, 1928, preface). She demonstrated how French, German, and British militarist polemicists were mirror images one of another, her greatest opprobrium being directed at the millionaires of the popular press, such as Northcliffe and Harmsworth, who deliberately upped their sales by stoking righteous, nationalist hate. In analysing mass culture and bourgeois culture as both the products and the determinants of social psychology, she anticipated media studies by over fifty years. It may be imagined how the triumph of Italian fascism and German Nazism and the approach of the Second World War with all its atrocities darkened the end of her life. She died at 26 Thurlow Road, Hampstead, London, &#145;a spinster of independent means&#146;, on 27 January 1948.<br>
