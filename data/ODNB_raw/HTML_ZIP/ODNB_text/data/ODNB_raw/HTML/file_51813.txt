<span class="headword">Cripps, Sir  John Stafford</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Fernacres Cottage, Fulmer, Burnham, Buckinghamshire, on 10 May 1912, the only son and eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32630/', "Sir (Richard) Stafford Cripps (1889&#150;1952)")</script>, politician, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30983/', "Dame Isobel Cripps, n&#233;e Swithinbank (1891&#150;1979)")</script>, overseas aid organizer. The family was long established in west Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, and Cripps lived for all but the first few years of his life at Filkins, just inside Oxfordshire. Educated at Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford, he took a brilliant first in modern Greats, chaired the university Labour Club, and was secretary of the Oxford Union. In the general election of 1935 he was unsuccessful for Labour at Exeter. With friends such as the future Labour leader Michael Foot (whom he claimed to have helped convert from Liberalism), he seemed set for a political career on the left. But in 1938, determined on a course distinct from his father's, he was led by his concern for countryside communities to take a post on the advertising staff of <span class="italic">The Countryman</span>, then edited by J. W. Robertson Scott at Idbury, near Filkins. During the war this was perforce a part-time job; as a conscientious objector Cripps was required to work some days a week as a market gardener on the family's 500 acre farm at Filkins. Cripps's pacifism reflected his Quakerism and during the war he helped to revive the Burford Friends' meeting, of which he remained a member (noted more for silence than speech) for the rest of his life. He was editor of <span class="italic">The Countryman</span> from 1947 to 1971. In 1946 he began his forty-one years on Filkins parish council and was elected to the Witney rural district council; he was still a member at its demise in 1974. On 29 December 1936 he married Ursula Davy; they had four sons and two daughters. They were divorced in 1971 and Cripps married Ann Elizabeth Farwell, a journalist, on 14 August 1971.<br>
<br>Cripps made <span class="italic">The Countryman</span> an authoritative and influential voice for the countryside, as much concerned for employment, schools, shops, and transport as for conservation; the quarterly's circulation peaked at 88,895 in 1954. Backed by a talented and devoted staff, he found time to pursue the magazine's objectives through his work in local government. He chaired his district council from 1959 to 1962 and the Rural District Councils' Association from 1967 to 1970; he was appointed CBE for his services to local government in 1968, and was deeply involved in the campaign to &#145;keep local government local&#146; before the changes of 1974.<br>
<br>From 1970 to 1977 Cripps chaired the Countryside Commission, then at the height of its influence. With sympathies in both camps, he sought to reconcile farmers and conservationists. He persuaded ministers and civil servants, whom the demands of farming had dominated since 1945, to take countryside conservation more seriously. Under his chairmanship the commission offered a first tentative challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy that efficient farming is necessarily beautiful farming. In close alliance with the commission's forceful director, Reg Hookway, he achieved the settlement of national park administration in 1974. This compromise angered conservationists because it left the parks ultimately under local-authority control; but it proved a long-term success because it gave them their own staff and considerable autonomy. He was knighted in 1978.<br>
<br>Cripps left his mark on many aspects of rural life and amenities. He served on the government-appointed committee in 1968 which ruled against rationalization of the public-path network; he was a notably awkward member of the defence lands committee in the early 1970s, refusing to join the majority in favour of military training on beautiful landscapes, and he produced the radical report on accommodation for gypsies for the government in 1976. Despite his early abandonment of party politics he remained a socialist and a believer in public ownership of land. In the 1980s this took practical form when he used the sale of a farmhouse on his Filkins property to finance the development of a redundant farmyard and buildings for light industrial and retail units. He served on many Oxfordshire bodies concerned with rural life, education, and voluntary work; and on such national organizations as the Council for the Preservation of Rural England and the Nature Conservancy.<br>
<br>Despite his years in journalism and public life Cripps was neither an orator nor a flashing wordsmith. He spoke in an austere but compelling Quaker style and wrote similarly, often with difficulty but striving always for clarity and honesty of expression. He was a socialist active in rural affairs, in which leaders and opinion formers during his lifetime were overwhelmingly Conservative. He died of leukaemia on 9 August 1993 at his home, Fox House, Filkins, and is buried in Filkins cemetery.<br>
