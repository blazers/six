<span class="headword">Connelly,  Pierce</span>  (1804&#150;1883), <span class="occ">apostate Episcopal priest and anti-Catholic pamphleteer</span>, was born on 9 August 1804 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the eldest of four sons of Henry Connelly, a cabinet-maker, and his second wife, Elizabeth Pierce. He married Cornelia Peacock [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38451/', "Connelly, Cornelia (1809&#150;1879)")</script>] on 1 December 1831; they had two children who survived to adulthood, Adeline and Pierce Francis (the latter became a sculptor in Italy and the United States). Brought up as a Presbyterian, Connelly became an Episcopalian at the University of Pennsylvania (BA 1821, MA 1824). He read theology under William White, bishop of Pennsylvania, and was ordained deacon (1826) and priest (1828).<br>
<br>Appointed rector of Trinity parish, Natchez, Mississippi, in 1831, Connelly read anti-Catholic pamphlets, met the royalist exile scientist Joseph Nicolas Nicollet, and decided that Roman Catholicism taught slaves to be docile more effectively than Anglicanism. He resigned his cure in 1835, moved to Rome, and was converted on Palm Sunday (27 March) 1836. (His wife had converted in December 1835.) The international financial crisis of 1837, which ushered in the &#145;hungry forties&#146;, forced their return to the United States, where they taught school in Grand Coteau, Louisiana, from 1838 to 1842. Connelly believed that he had a vocation to the priesthood, and convinced Cornelia that they should give up sexual relations. They returned to Rome in 1843 and received a papal decree of separation; Pierce was re-ordained and Cornelia entered a convent. During this time, the family was &#145;reconstituted&#146; once a week for the children to play in their parents' presence.<br>
<br>In 1846 the Roman Catholic bishop Nicholas Wiseman asked Cornelia to start a religious order to educate middle-class girls. Simultaneously, John Talbot, sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury, asked Pierce to become his assistant chaplain at Alton Towers. Both moved to England that summer, but Connelly soon grew frustrated. Wiseman did not give him the respect he wanted, nor was he permitted to visit Cornelia as he had in Rome. Moreover, Cornelia had found her vocation as founder of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, and no longer obeyed Pierce. When he learned that Wiseman was moving Cornelia and the order from Derby to St Leonards, he took refuge in December 1848 with Henry Drummond at Albury Park, Surrey. Drummond, an anti-Catholic tory banker, supported Connelly for the following six years. Hoping to show that Roman Catholicism was a marriage wrecker, Drummond convinced Connelly to sue his wife for restitution of conjugal rights. Connelly eventually lost his case, for it was clear that he had exercised his free choice to convert, become celibate, and end their marriage. Throughout, the case of <i>Connelly v. Connelly</i> (court of arches, 1849; judicial committee of the privy council, 1851) fed the newspaper-reading public with tales of sex, greed, and power.<br>
<br>Connelly wrote anti-Catholic pamphlets, publishing some under the pen-names &#145;Pascal the Younger&#146; and &#145;Pen Cler Jocelyn&#146;. His petition to the House of Commons in connection with his court case was so prurient and libellous that it was printed &#145;for the use of Members only&#146;. He perhaps inspired one of the most notorious anti-Catholic slurs ever uttered in the house, when Drummond declared in 1851 that convents were &#145;either prisons or brothels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 115.266). Some of his pamphlets charged that priests slept with nuns, that casuist moral theology condoned crimes, and that Roman Catholicism was essentially persecutory and dictatorial. His <span class="italic">Reasons for Abjuring Allegiance to the See of Rome: a Letter to the Earl of Shrewsbury</span> (1852) entered the anti-Catholic canon, appearing on both sides of the Atlantic and remaining in print into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Debarred from preferment in the Church of England, to which he now adhered, Connelly moved to the continent, wrote for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (using the pen-name &#145;Thorough&#146;), and in 1867 founded St James's Episcopal Church in Florence, for American visitors who did not wish to attend the English chapel. He developed bronchial pneumonia at the age of seventy-nine, and died on 16 December 1883.<br>
<br>Pierce Connelly had a pointed chin, broad forehead, long nose, and large ears set high on his prematurely bald head, which characteristics, several observers remarked, gave him an impish appearance. His career illustrates the public role of converts in Victorian denominational controversies, and gives an insight into the milieu of the anti-Catholic campaigner.<br>
