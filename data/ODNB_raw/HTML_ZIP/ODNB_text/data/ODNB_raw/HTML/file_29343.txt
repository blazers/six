<span class="headword">Melville,  George John  Whyte-</span>  (1821&#150;1878), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 19 June 1821 at Strathkinness, Fife, the eldest son of Major John Whyte-Melville (1796/7&#150;1883) of Strathkinness, convenor of the county of Fife, and his wife, Catherine Anne Sarah Osborne (1791/2&#150;1878), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20876/', "Francis Godolphin Osborne, fifth duke of Leeds")</script>. Robert Whytt (1714&#150;1766) was his great-grandfather. He was educated at Eton College under John Keate, and in 1839 received a commission in the 93rd highlanders. He exchanged into the Coldstream Guards in 1846, was made captain, and retired in 1849. He married, on 7 August 1847, Charlotte, daughter of William Hanbury, first Lord Bateman; they had a daughter, Florence Elizabeth, who became the Viscountess Massareene. However, he did not have a happy relationship with his wife, and she eventually remarried bigamously.<br>
<br>When the Crimean War broke out in 1854, Whyte-Melville volunteered for active service and was appointed major of Turkish irregular cavalry. After peace was restored two years later, he devoted himself to literature and field sports, especially fox-hunting, on which he soon came to be regarded as an authority. He lived for some years in Northamptonshire after his marriage and then moved to Tetbury in Gloucestershire. He published some translations of Horace in 1850, and in 1853 his first novel appeared, <span class="italic">Captain Digby Grand: an Autobiography</span>, which was initially serialized in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. It was, arguably, semi-autobiographical: its hero leaves Eton and joins the army, sees service in North America, and, after a period of dissipated living, inherits, marries, and goes hunting. The book was popular.<br>
<br>Over the next twenty-five years, Whyte-Melville wrote twenty-five more novels, some of contemporary life and some historical romances. He was particularly concerned with the military and sporting life. He drew on his experiences of the Crimean War for <span class="italic">The Interpreter: a Tale of the War</span> (1858). The title of <span class="italic">Riding Recollections</span> (1875) is self-explanatory, while John Sutherland notes <span class="italic">Katerfelto</span> (1875) for its &#145;vivid stag-hunting scenes&#146;  (Sutherland, 672). On the other hand, it was with a romance set during the English civil war, <span class="italic">Holmby House: a Tale of Old Northamptonshire</span> (1860), that he established his name.<br>
<br>Despite Whyte-Melville's devotion to literature, he did not seem to regard himself as a professional, or even as a particularly good, novelist. All his earnings from writing he gave to projects such as the provision of reading-rooms for grooms and stable-boys in hunting-quarters. Nor, according to his friend Frederick Locker-Lampson, did he seek out overtly literary society, preferring the company of soldiers, hunters, and country gentlemen  (Locker-Lampson, 382). The plots of his novels were sometimes incredible and always exciting; <span class="italic">The Times</span> (4 January 1871) remarked on his &#145;light and rapid style, which seems to run on wheels&#146;. However, his concerns were not necessarily light-hearted. For example, his long religious poem <span class="italic">The True Cross</span> (1873) delineates a punitive God and, with great ambivalence, a proud, noble yet damned hunter and his lady.<br>
<br>Given his reputation, Whyte-Melville's death was ironic. On 5 December 1878 he was hunting near the White Horse, in the Vale of Pewsey; the hounds had found a fox, and he was galloping along the grass headland of a ploughed field. His horse fell, and he broke his neck and was killed outright. He was buried at Tetbury. His friends commissioned R. W. Edis to design both a large marble cross, placed over his grave, and a memorial fountain at St Andrews in Scotland. Joseph Edgar Boehm designed a portrait medallion to adorn the fountain. Whyte-Melville's father survived him, and at his death in 1883 Strathkinness passed to his kinsman, James Balfour, who assumed the name of Melville in addition to his own.<br>
