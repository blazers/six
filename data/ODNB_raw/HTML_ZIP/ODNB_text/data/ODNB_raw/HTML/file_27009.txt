<span class="headword">Taverner,  William</span>  (1700&#150;1772), <span class="occ">lawyer and landscape painter</span>, was born on 25 November 1700 in London, and baptized the same day at St Martin Ludgate, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27008/', "William Taverner (d. 1731)")</script>, lawyer and dramatist, and his wife, Alathea Taverner, and grandson of Jeremiah Taverner, portrait painter. He followed his father into the specialized profession of ecclesiastical law, becoming a public notary in 1737 and in 1739 proctor of the court of arches, the archbishop of Canterbury's court of appeal for the province of Canterbury. This court was based in Bow church, London, and Taverner appears to have spent the whole of his life in and near the capital. By 1733 he was already well known as a painter and was described by George Vertue as possessing &#145;a wonderfull genius to drawing of Landskap in an excellent manner adornd with figures in a stile above the common &amp; paints in oil in a very commendable &amp; masterly manner&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.68).<br>
<br>Since he was not, like most professional landscape painters of the period, obliged to paint country house or estate views in order to earn a living, Taverner seems to have been free to experiment more widely than his contemporaries with subject matter and technique. Martin Hardie considered him to be &#145;our first regular and systematic painter of free landscape in watercolour&#146;  (Hardie, 1.69). It is not known who taught him the rudiments of painting, but the open, airy atmosphere and panoramic composition of some of his watercolours strongly suggest the influence of Peter Tillemans (<i>c</i>.1684&#150;1734), who moved to London from Antwerp in 1708. It is also clear that Taverner's choice of landscape subjects (typically sandpits and woodland ponds in the vicinity of London), and their compositional structure, owe much to the Italianate paintings of Gaspard Dughet (1615&#150;1675), whose work was widely collected in England throughout the eighteenth century. Taverner is unusual among early English watercolourists in his frequent introduction to his landscapes of groups of classically inspired figures. An example is the highly accomplished chalk, ink wash, and watercolour drawing <span class="italic">Diana and her Nymphs by a Woodland Pool</span> (with Agnews, London, 2003), one of several drawings of this subject, which belonged to the print dealer John Thane (1748&#150;1818); it was engraved in 1780, after Taverner's death, by Thomas Gaugain (1748&#150;1812). Taverner's Diana drawings may have been one source of inspiration for Thomas Gainsborough's notable series of drawings on the theme of Diana and Actaeon executed in the 1780s. In broader terms, Taverner's use of various combinations of chalks, ink, watercolour washes, and bodycolour to produce a generalized but imaginative form of landscape appears to have had an effect on Gainsborough's approach to the depiction of nature. Paul Sandby (1725&#150;1809), who owned a number of drawings by Taverner, also owed a great deal to his example.<br>
<br>Taverner did not contribute to the public exhibitions organized by the Incorporated Society of Artists and the Society of Arts in the 1760s, or the Royal Academy exhibitions, inaugurated in 1769. He was also peculiarly reluctant to show his work to visitors to his own house. Despite (or perhaps in a perverse way, because of) this diffidence, his work was widely known and admired&#151;the diarist Joseph Farington noted &#145;Taverner had much quaking abt. shewing his pictures, which raised their reputation&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.765).<br>
<br>Taverner the watercolourist is now reasonably well represented in public collections, his <span class="italic">Italian Composition: the Outskirts of a Town</span> (Tate collection), <span class="italic">Landscape with Nymphs Bathing</span> (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), and <span class="italic">Country Road Leading to a Church</span> (British Museum, prints and drawings), for example, illustrating the range of his style and technique. His oils are rare: a <span class="italic">Wooded Landscape with Nymphs and Satyrs</span> (University of Liverpool) is close in style to the work of George Lambert; <span class="italic">Jonah and the Whale</span> (Stourhead) is after Gaspard Dughet. Other examples were evidently familiar to Colonel Maurice Grant, who described them as &#145;dignified canvases relieved from gloom by touches of smart and peculiar colour introduced here and there over the work&#146;  (Grant, 191). The sale held after Taverner's death (Langfords, Covent Garden, 21 February 1774) included oil studies of &#145;histories&#146;, heads, dogs, plants, and even &#145;hares, lions etc&#146;, showing him to have been a more diverse artist than the one we now know. The sale catalogue also reveals the breadth of his collection, which included prints after Marco Ricci, Raphael, Poussin, Claude, Domenichino, and Vouet, as well as a large number of engravings after Rubens&#151;this enthusiasm being reflected in the eight landscape watercolours &#145;in the style of Rubens&#146; by Taverner himself, which were also included in the sale. He is not known to have married. He left a bequest and all his personal effects to his servant Sarah Davis and died in London on 20 October 1772.<br>
