<span class="headword">Allen,  William Edward David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>James Drennan, Liam Pawle]</span>  (1901&#150;1973), <span class="occ">historian and businessman</span>, was born on 6 January 1901 at 12 Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London, the eldest of the three sons of William Edward Allen (1860&#150;1919), printer and theatre owner, and his wife, Sarah Collett (1863&#150;1944), daughter of Thomas Phinn QC, who had some success on the stage as Cissie Grahame. His father was born in Belfast, the third son of David Allen, who had founded the printing business of David Allen &amp; Sons, which under William senior's guidance moved its headquarters to London, where it became the nerve centre of theatrical advertising in Britain and a major force in bill-posting. His remarkable mother later went into theatrical management and became, after her husband's death, both chairman and majority shareholder of the Allen business. W. E. D. (Bill) Allen was baptized into the Church of England (despite his family's Presbyterian origins), was educated in Mr Goodhart's house at Eton College (1914&#150;18), and published his first book, <span class="italic">The Turks in Europe</span> (1919), when he was eighteen.<br>
<br>Instead of going to Oxford after his father's death, Allen briefly studied commerce and accounting, joined the family firm as a &#145;canvasser&#146; in 1920 and was made a director in 1922. He became chairman in 1927, retaining that position until 1970. His <span class="italic">David Allens: the History of a Family Firm, 1857&#150;1957</span> (1957) gives a vivid account of family tensions, the move out of printing and theatrical advertising, and the unsuccessful attempts to make the firm an advertising agency in its own right and to become a force in radio advertising from a base in Andorra. The business was highly sensitive to changes in national prosperity, and suffered considerably from restrictions imposed in each of the world wars, but it recovered rapidly after 1945.<br>
<br>The business gave Bill Allen financial independence, but never wholly absorbed him. In the 1920s he travelled extensively and acted as a special correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> during the Riff and Graeco-Turkish wars. He published a sober study of the Caucasus in the <span class="roman">Nations of Today</span> series (1923), and a mannered book called <span class="italic">Beled-es-Siba</span> (1925): mainly about Morocco, it also includes an affectionate and brilliant essay on the Orangemen of west Tyrone which has much historical value. On visits to Constantinople and the countries of the Black Sea he made a remarkable collection of icons, dispersed from former Greek churches in Turkey, and from the Soviet Union. Twenty-four of the icons were later acquired by the National Gallery of Ireland.<br>
<br>On 6 December 1922 Allen married Lady Phyllis Edith King (1897&#150;1947), daughter of the third earl of Lovelace, and their daughter was born in 1925. The marriage was not a success and ended in divorce in 1932. Until about 1935 Cissie Allen financed her son's personal enterprises. She also provided a home at Commonwood House, Chipperfield, Hertfordshire, where he and his brothers could bring their guests at weekends: in Bill's case, he wrote later, these would include &#145;bizarre intellectuals, Caucasian philologists and exiled national leaders from the remoter parts of Central Asia&#146;  (Allen, 262).<br>
<br>In 1929 Allen's career took a controversial turn. He had always identified with the Ulster origins of his family, and although there was a strong family tradition against mixing business and politics, he became Ulster Unionist MP for West Belfast. He used his time in parliament to raise topics from China to Central America, but he was less good as a speaker than as a writer. He became one of Sir Oswald Mosley's closest associates, and, alone among those taking the Conservative whip, joined Mosley's New Party. Although Allen ceased to be an MP in 1931 he wrote the &#145;Letters of Lucifer&#146; for <span class="italic">The Blackshirt</span>, attacking tory plutocracy, and in 1934 published a full-scale defence of British fascism, <span class="italic">BUF: Oswald Mosley and British Fascism</span>, under the pseudonym James Drennan. In it he argued for a collectivist &#145;Elizabethan&#146; model of society, instead of the liberal bourgeois system which he considered to have failed, and that parliament needed streamlining if the drastic action required to cure the evils of the depression was to be taken. The book presented Mosley's career in heroic terms, and contrasted it with the cowardice of the MPs who might have joined him. It was British fascism's most systematic defence. Later Allen withdrew from Mosley in disillusionment.<br>
<br>In 1932 Allen had published his lively and respected <span class="italic">History of the Georgian People</span> and that July married Paula Alexandra Gellibrand (1893&#150;1981), formerly wife of the marqu&egrave;s de Casa Maury. She was a society beauty, much photographed by Cecil Beaton, and may have been the model for the heroine of Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">Serena Blandish</span>. They lived partly at Mullagh Cottage, near Killyleagh, co. Down, and jointly wrote <span class="italic">Strange Coast</span> (1936), a novel of romance and adventure set in a fictionalized Georgia of the 1920s, which appeared under the pseudonym Liam Pawle. The marriage was dissolved in 1939.<br>
<br>Between 1939 and 1949, Allen was mainly in Africa and the Middle East. He wrote a valuable history of Ukraine, prepared with the collaboration of several Russian and Ukrainian scholars, which appeared in 1940, dedicated to N. M., &#145;half Ukrainian, half Angel&#146;&#151;Nataliya (Natasha) Maksimovna (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;1966), daughter of Maksim Kossovsky, late of the imperial Moscow bar. She became his third wife on 6 March 1943. During the Second World War, Allen first served with the Household Cavalry. In 1941 he was a captain with Orde Wingate's military mission to Abyssinia where, as transport officer, he successfully took Sudanese camels over mountain terrain. He was invalided out of the army and held a series of civilian posts as press attach&eacute; and information officer, and became information counsellor at Ankara during the critical period between 1947 and 1949. He was appointed OBE in 1948. Penguin published his book <span class="italic">Guerrilla War in Abyssinia</span> (1943) and his accounts, with Pavel Muratov, <span class="italic">The Russian Campaigns of 1941&#150;43</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">The Russian Campaigns of 1944&#150;1945</span> (1946). The book on Abyssinia is autobiographical and has inimitable period atmosphere. It is also a classic study of the conditions for successful guerrilla war.<br>
<br>In 1946 Allen acquired Whitechurch House, Cappagh, co. Waterford, and from 1949 Natasha Allen's talents turned the derelict mansion and gardens into a home which welcomed a constant stream of guests. Allen now divided his working time between the affairs of David Allens, the estate at Whitechurch, and the two major books which he completed during the 1950s. <span class="italic">Caucasian Battlefields</span> (1953), written with Pavel Muratov, remains a classic study. <span class="italic">David Allens</span> (1957) is a fine piece of business history and a stylish collective biography of the Allen family. He also wrote a short study, <span class="italic">The Poet and the Spae Wife</span> (1960), which linked his interest in the history of the Maghrib with his affection for Ireland, and in 1963 published a powerful essay, <span class="italic">Problems of Turkish Power in the Sixteenth Century</span>. He continued to travel widely, to Iran, to Alaska, and to Yucatan, accompanied by Natasha, though her health had begun to fail. She died in 1966 after a lengthy illness. In 1969 he married (Gertrude) Anne Pentland, a nurse. A son was born in 1972.<br>
<br>Allen's final historical study, prepared with Anthony Mango as translator, was an edition of the records of the Russian embassies to the Georgian kings between 1589 and 1605, which was published by the Hakluyt Society in 1970. He died on 18 September 1973 at 96 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, and was buried at Chipperfield parish church, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Allen was a man of many talents: a gentleman, a businessman, a philosopher, an adventurer, but continuously and most powerfully an energetic historian and linguist. He made his library, later held by the University of Indiana, the finest private collection of books on Georgia and the Caucasus in the Western world. Throughout his life he travelled extensively in remote places and may be the only person to have walked the entire length of the Turkish-Russian frontier. Personally he was exceedingly loyal and generous. His history of David Allens brings out the depth of his affection for his family and its Ulster origins, and for those who had worked for the enterprise.<br>
