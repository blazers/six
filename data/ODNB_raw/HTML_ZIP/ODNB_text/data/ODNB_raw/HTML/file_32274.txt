<span class="headword">Campbell,  (William) Howard</span>  (1859&#150;1910), <span class="occ">missionary and entomologist</span>, was born in Londonderry on 20 September 1859, eldest of the nine children of Thomas Callender Campbell, businessman and lay Christian worker. Known to his family as Howard, he was an avid collector of insects and with his six brothers built up a nationally famous collection of Irish moths and butterflies. He was educated at the Academical Institution, Londonderry, and at Edinburgh University, where he studied first arts (MA, 1880), and afterwards, with a view to becoming a missionary, divinity (BD, 1882). He was a keen cricketer and he played rugby for the university; although not tall, he had a wiry, athletic frame and ran very fast.<br>
<br>On 12 September 1884 Campbell was ordained by the London Missionary Society (LMS) at Londonderry's Congregational church, and soon after he departed for the district of Cuddapah in south India. He was later joined by his fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Nevin (<i>b</i>. 1858), daughter of David Boyd of Drukendult, Ballymoney, co. Antrim, whom he married at Madras on 7 December 1885.<br>
<br>For seventeen years Campbell worked among the low-caste and &#145;untouchable&#146; villagers of the Cuddapah plains, preaching a vigorous Christian socialism which attacked caste and economic inequalities head-on. His socialist sympathies were well known; he was a member of the Independent Labour Party and claimed Keir Hardie as a friend. Nevertheless, he also fully backed imperialism, arguing that no one could rule India as well as the British did.<br>
<br>Campbell's colleagues rated him as an excellent preacher and marvelled at his boundless energy which, even with a punishing itinerating schedule, enabled him to amass an internationally significant collection of Indian moths, between sixty and seventy species of which were new to science. He was credited with founding scores of churches and schools and he wrote several texts which became standard works in Indian theological colleges, three of which were: <span class="italic">Grounds for Belief in a Personal God</span> (1893); <span class="italic">Christian Evidences</span> (1898); and <span class="italic">Christian Theology</span> (1905).<br>
<br>About 1901, and initially against his will, Campbell was transferred to the LMS's training institution at Gooty. He was already an examiner in philosophy to Madras University and at Gooty he proved to be an excellent teacher and administrator, as well as a fine cricket coach. His skills in Telugu soon attracted the attention of the Madras government and, at their order and with Veerasalingam Pantalu, he revised C. P. Brown's <span class="italic">Telegu&#150;English Dictionary</span> (1906) and A. H. Arden's <span class="italic">Progressive Telegu Grammar</span> (1905). He also served on the committee to revise the Telugu <span class="roman">Bible</span> between 1898 and 1903. Campbell was an enthusiastic advocate of union between the Congregationalist, Presbyterian, and Baptist missions, and in 1908 he rejoiced at the creation of the United Church of South India, which brought 150,000 protestants under one ecclesiastical umbrella.<br>
<br>In 1909 Campbell was appointed head of the new Union Theological College at Bangalore, but he was forced to return home by an attack of sprue. His condition worsening, he moved for the winter to Bordighera in the Italian riviera, where he died, aged fifty, on 18 February 1910. He was buried in the local English cemetery, which overlooked the Mediterranean. His wife and four sons survived him, one of whom, Samuel Burnside Boyd Campbell (1889&#150;1971), won twelve international rugby caps.<br>
