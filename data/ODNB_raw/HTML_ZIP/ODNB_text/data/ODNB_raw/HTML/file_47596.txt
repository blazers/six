<span class="headword">Hambro, Sir  Everard Alexander</span>  (1842&#150;1925), <span class="occ">merchant banker and philanthropist</span>, was born at Bransbury House, Willesden, in London, on 11 April 1842, the youngest of the three sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48884/', "Baron Carl Joachim Hambro (1807&#150;1877)")</script>, merchant banker, and his wife, Caroline Gostenhofer (1810&#150;1852). By 1839 Carl Joachim had returned from Denmark and founded in London the family firm of C. J. Hambro &amp; Son, which quickly emerged as a leading merchant bank.<br>
<br>Everard (nicknamed Evy) was the brother of Charles Joseph Theophilus Hambro (1834&#150;1891), MP for Weymouth (1868&#150;74) and Dorset South (1886&#150;91), and of Percival Lewis Hambro (1836&#150;1885). He was educated at J. P. Clover's school, Roehampton, and Trinity College, Cambridge. On 23 October 1863 he married (Gertrude) Mary Stuart (1848&#150;1905), the daughter of Martin Ridley Smith of Warren House, Hayes, Kent, and Celia, daughter of Henry Stuart (1808&#150;1880), of Montfort, Isle of Bute, who was a descendant of George III's prime minister, John Stuart, third earl of Bute. The couple settled at 70 Prince's Gate, London; they also rented Mount Clare, Richmond Park, and in 1874 joined his father, Carl Joachim Hambro, at Gifford House, Putney Heath, where J. P. Morgan was his neighbour. They became close friends and collaborators in business.<br>
<br>In 1864 Hambro joined C. J. Hambro &amp; Son. In 1869 he became one of the bank's four partners, and on the death of his father in 1877 he became senior partner of the bank. He held 75 per cent of the bank's capital of &pound;650,000. In 1878 his earnings from the bank were &pound;52,000, and they rose to &pound;150,000 in 1886. By 1890 the bank's capital had grown to &pound;1.3 million; it was one of London's largest and most prestigious houses.<br>
<br>During the 1870s and for the next thirty years, Hambro gave time and money to good causes. In 1873 he bought a house at Roehampton and started an orphanage which he supported until 1879; it became known as the Hambro Orphanage for Girls, and was finally given to the Church of England's Children's Society (Waifs and Strays) in 1909. He played a major part in the foundation of the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses in 1886. He became KCVO in 1908.<br>
<br>In 1879 Hambro was elected to the court of the Bank of England. Here he was instrumental in proposed reforms to the important Bank of England committee of treasury&#151;which he joined in 1910&#151;and the committee of daily waiting; the passage of his reforms set junior and senior members of the court at odds. His unpopularity with former governors of the bank assured that he would not be elected governor or deputy governor. Henry Gibbs, a former governor, described Hambro's resolutions of 1 February 1894 as &#145;being antagonistic unlike anything he had known in his forty-one years at the Bank&#146;  (Bramsen and Wain, 334).<br>
<br>Hambro was an assertive and imposing man. He greatly increased his private reserves and those of the bank by expanding its finance of international trade, especially between North and South America, by the syndication of railroad loans, and through bullion dealing. In financing international trade he worked closely with the New York banks Phelps, Stokes &amp; Co., Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., and Heidelbach and Ickelheimer &amp; Co. Although he handled issues for corporate entities in the 1870s and 1880s, the bank's business in foreign loans was of vital importance. Hambro issued loans for the governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Greece, Russia, and Italy. Prominent among his supporters in this work were the houses of Hoskier in France, Tietgen in Denmark, and Morgan in America. His chief ally in London was E. C. Baring (later Lord Revelstoke) of Baring Brothers &amp; Co.<br>
<br>In 1881&#150;2, with Barings, Hambro issued an enormous loan of &pound;29 million for the Italian government, in competition with Baron Alphonse de Rothschild (1827&#150;1905) in Paris. Throughout difficult and fluctuating international markets, Hambro remained steady and reported a profit of 1.14 per cent for his syndicate of banks&#151;or &pound;350,000. This issue broke the Rothschild monopoly of Italian government loans, and confirmed Hambro as one of the greatest international bankers of his generation. However the issue had come within a whisker of failure, which would have ruined both banks.<br>
<br>In 1890 Hambro repaid the support of Revelstoke by playing a leading role in the rescue of Barings at the time of the Baring crisis. Early on he was important in bringing together Barings and the Bank of England while his firm subscribed handsomely to the Bank Guarantee Fund, which underwrote Baring's rescue. Yet Hambros had also been underwriter of the flotation of the Buenos Aires Water Supply and Drainage Company Ltd, the failed transaction which had laid Barings low.<br>
<br>The profits of C. J. Hambro &amp; Son fell sharply, in line with a City slump, in 1890. Hambro sought peace at the Villa Espoir, Biarritz, where he played golf. In 1892 he suffered a bout of ill health which kept him from business. He convalesced at the Scottish estate, Gannochy, near Brechin, in Forfarshire, which he had rented from the earl of Dalhousie, and at Hayes Place, Kent, where he kept a herd of pedigree Guernsey cows. In the mid-1890s, Hambro returned to the City and raised foreign loans for the Scandinavian countries and arranged project finance in South Africa and the Americas.<br>
<br>Hambro and his wife Mary had eight children. One died at birth; two, Hermione and Maurice, died in childhood. Five survived: Charles Eric Hambro KBE (1872&#150;1947), Harold Everard Hambro CBE (1876&#150;1952), Angus Valdemar Hambro (1883&#150;1957), Violet Mary Hambro MBE (1884&#150;1965), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48885/', "(Ronald) Olaf Hambro (1885&#150;1961)")</script>. In June 1900 Hambro bought the Milton Abbey estate from his nephew, Henry Charles (Harry) Hambro (1869&#150;1933). In June 1905 Mary died at the age of fifty-seven. Hambro retreated to Milton Abbey and developed his interest in shooting: a royal shooting party in December 1909 consisted of forty-six beaters, thirty-one gamekeepers and loaders, and ten guns, who in three days shot 1300 pheasants.<br>
<br>At seventy Hambro married Ebba, younger daughter of C. Beresford Whyte of Leitrim, a woman in her early twenties whom he had met at Biarritz. Hambro was a handsome and charismatic man. A contemporary records, &#145;Cast like a heroic mould on a colossal scale, one of the handsomest men even at 68 &hellip; a giant not only in stature, but in character, in ability, in talents&#146;  (Bramsen and Wain, 348). During the First World War Hambro returned to work in the City and closely associated himself and the bank with Scandinavian trade relations, acting as the British government agent for the purchase of Norwegian kroner in 1916. In 1920 he became first chairman of the bank created by the unification of C. J. Hambro &amp; Son and the British Bank of Northern Commerce Ltd, backed by leading Scandinavian capitalists anxious to diversify to London. It was known as Hambros Bank of Northern Commerce Ltd, in 1921 abbreviated to Hambros Bank Ltd, and he was chairman until his death.<br>
<br>Sir Everard Hambro died at Hayes Place, Kent, on 26 February 1925. He had led the bank for forty-eight years, and had presided over changes in the City and as a director of the Bank of England. The meeting of the court in March 1925 reads:<blockquote>The Court desire to place on record their high appreciation of his conspicuous abilities and wide knowledge of affairs which, throughout this long period, have always been at the service of the Bank. They also wish to express their feelings of personal regard for one who, by his unvarying kindliness and courtesy and by his personal charm has won the esteem and affection of every member of the Court. (Bramsen and Wain, 376)</blockquote>
