<span class="headword">Norway,  Nevil Shute</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Nevil Shute]</span>  (1899&#150;1960), <span class="occ">novelist and aeronautical engineer</span>, was born in Ealing, London, on 17 January 1899, the younger son of Arthur Hamilton Norway CB (1859&#150;1938), who became an assistant secretary at the General Post Office and wrote erudite travel books, and his wife, Mary Louisa Gadsden (<i>d</i>. 1932). At the age of eleven Norway played truant from his first preparatory school in Hammersmith, spending inquisitive days among the model aircraft at the Science Museum. On being detected in these precocious studies he was sent to the Dragon School, Oxford, and thence to Shrewsbury School. His brother, Fred, was killed in action in 1915. Norway was on holiday in Dublin, where his father was then secretary to the Post Office in Ireland, at the time of the Easter rising of 1916 and acted as a stretcher-bearer, winning commendation for gallant conduct. He passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, with the aim of being commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps; but a bad stammer led to his being failed at his final medical examination, and he returned to civil life. In August 1918 he enlisted in the Suffolk regiment as a private and was posted on the Isle of Grain.<br>
<br>In 1919 Norway went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he took third-class honours in engineering science in 1922 and rowed in the college second eight. During the vacations he worked, unpaid, for the Aircraft Manufacturing Company at Hendon, then for Geoffrey de Havilland's own firm, which he joined as an employee on coming down from Oxford. He fulfilled his thwarted wartime ambition of learning to fly in 1923 and gained experience as a test observer by 1924. During the evenings he wrote novels and short stories, unperturbed by publishers' rejection slips. He wrote under his forenames only, as he felt authorship would compromise his reputation as a serious engineer. His first book, <span class="italic">Marazan</span>, was published in 1926.<br>
<br>In 1924 Norway took the post of chief calculator to the Airship Guarantee Company, a subsidiary of Vickers Ltd, to work on the construction of the R100. In 1929 he became deputy chief engineer under Barnes Wallis and in the following year he flew to and from Canada in the R100. He had a passionate belief in the future of airships but his hopes foundered in the crash of its government rival, the R101, wrecked with the loss of Lord Thomson, the minister of aviation, and most of those on board. He had watched with mounting horror what he regarded as the criminal inefficiency with which the R101 was constructed. His experience in this phase of his career left a lasting bitterness; it bred in him an almost pathological distrust of politicians and civil servants.<br>
<br>In 1931 Norway married Frances Mary Heaton, a doctor. They had two daughters. It was in the same year that, having recognized that airship development was a lost cause, he founded Airspeed Ltd, aeroplane constructors, in an old garage; he remained the company's joint managing director until 1938. The pioneering atmosphere of aircraft construction in those years suited his temperament. He revelled in individual enterprise and doing things by improvisation on a financial shoestring. When the business grew and was becoming one of humdrum routine, producing aircraft to government orders, he decided to get out of the rut and live by writing. He had by 1938 enjoyed some success as a novelist and had sold the film rights of <span class="italic">Lonely Road</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">Ruined City</span> (1938).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Norway joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant in the miscellaneous weapons department. Rising to lieutenant-commander in 1941, he found experimenting with secret weapons a job after his own heart. But his growing celebrity as a writer caused him to be in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, for the Ministry of Information, and to be sent to Burma as a correspondent in 1945. Soon after demobilization in 1945 he emigrated to Australia and made his home in Langwarrin, Victoria. High taxation and what he felt to be the decadence of Britain, with the spirit of personal independence and freedom dying, led him to leave the old country.<br>
<br>As a writer Norway had an unaffectedly popular touch which made his books best-sellers throughout the Commonwealth and the United States; his success lay in his skill in combining loving familiarity with technicalities and a straightforward sense of human relationships and values. He conveyed to readers his own zest for making aircraft and flying them, and he sympathetically portrayed the hazards and rewards that were the lot of back-room boys. His briskly moving plots were superior to his characterizations, and he retained to the last the outlook of a decent, average public-school boy of his generation. Although he lived into the James Bond era he never made concessions to the fast-growing appetite in the mass-fiction market for sadism and violence.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">No Highway</span> (1948), dealing with the drama of structural fatigue in aircraft, set in human terms of those responsible for a competitive passenger service, gave full scope to both sides of Norway's talent. Machines and men and women share in shaping the drama. <span class="italic">A Town Like Alice</span> (1950), describing the grim odyssey of white women and children in Japanese-occupied Malaya, captured cinema audiences in 1958 as completely as it had the reading public. This novel was also produced as a television serial in 1981. <span class="italic">Round the Bend</span> (1951) was thought by Norway himself to be his most enduring book. It told of an aircraft engineer of mixed Eastern and Western stock who taught his men to worship God through work conscientiously and prayerfully performed and came to be regarded as divine by people of many creeds. <span class="italic">On the Beach</span> (1957) expressed Norway's sensitive appreciation of the frightful possibilities of global nuclear warfare and annihilation by radioactive dust. It was very popular and was filmed in 1959. Other novels, several of them also filmed, were <span class="italic">What Happened to the Corbetts</span> (1939), <span class="italic">An Old Captivity</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Landfall</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Pied Piper</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Pastoral</span> (1944), <span class="italic">In the Wet</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Requiem for a Wren</span> (1955).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Slide Rule</span> (1954), subtitled <span class="italic">The Autobiography of an Engineer</span>, Norway told, candidly and racily, of his life up to 1938, when he left the aircraft industry. His stammer, which was as much a stimulus as a handicap, did not prevent him from being good company, and he was always welcome at the social gatherings of his many friends. An enthusiastic yachtsman and fisherman as well as an air pilot, he delighted in outdoor life, and his gaiety was not dimmed by the heart attacks from which he suffered. He died in Melbourne on 12 January 1960.<br>
