<span class="headword">Speed,  Adolphus</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1647&#150;1659), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, has been often referred to as &#145;Adam&#146; Speed from the title-page of his only acknowledged work, <span class="italic">Adam out of Eden</span> (1659) where he signs himself &#145;Ad. Speed&#146;. That this stands for Adolphus, and not Adam, however, is proved by his autograph on an earlier publication. On the same title-page he claims gentle birth. There is nothing to prove it, or the assertion, made later, that he was a descendant of the historiographer John Speed. It is, however, just possible that he was a kinsman of the Chichester minister, William Speed. If so, this helps to explain his contact with, and support from, the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib, for the latter had known William Speed during his brief and unsuccessful attempt to establish an academy in Chichester in 1630.<br>
<br>The discredit and collapse of the system of patents and monopolies in England during the 1640s left the way open to enterprising &#145;projectors&#146; to advertise their passports to prosperity. For Speed, &#145;how excellent and how innocent the art of Husbandry is&#146; needed no demonstration  (<span class="italic">Adam out of Eden</span>, 3). That &#145;calling&#146; offered the prospect of endless prosperity, a Virginia &#145;within&#146;. He would be the agent for its realization. Already, in 1647, he was retained (through Hartlib) by Sir Cheney Culpeper, the inheritor of the Leeds Castle estate in the Kentish weald, to advise him on rabbit-farming on the Isle of Elmley. Speed appreciated the advantages of Hartlib's scheme for an &#145;Office of Address&#146; to advertise his skills and, in 1650, &#145;made hard shift to print some few Pages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hartlib Papers</span>, 46/5/1A) under the title <span class="italic">Generall Accommodations by Addresse</span>. The latter extolled the virtues of the proposed agency. At the same time, Speed tempted the public with enticing, risk-free opportunities of dazzling returns on landed investment through implementing his innovations. The pamphlet ended with a somewhat domestic design for a gentlemen's (and gentlewomen's) academy and a retirement home for elderly widows and spinsters.<br>
<br>It was probably about 1650 that Speed had to ask Hartlib to pay off his debts in order to release him from prison. &#145;Hartily ashamed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hartlib Papers</span>, 46/5/8A), he retired in poverty from London to the provinces, where he claimed to &#145;gaine excellent discoveries constantly&#146; to &#145;make myself famous&#146;  (ibid., 46/5/2A). In 1652 the pamphlet <span class="italic">Cornu copia</span> appeared. Often ascribed, either in sum or in part, to Hartlib, it was in reality the product of Speed's enterprising imagination. Subtitled &#145;A miscellanium of lucriferous and most fructiferous experiments, observations, and discoveries, immethodically distributed&#146;, it itemized fifty-four diverse schemes. These proposals can only be fully understood in the light of <span class="italic">Adam out of Eden</span>, which Hartlib helped Speed publish in 1659, but which must have existed in manuscript by at least 1652. Some of them involved new root crops (turnips and potatoes); others offered the potential benefits of new grasses (lucerne, clover-grass, and so on). He was particularly open to the possibilities for cash crops on farms within reach of the London market and commended the development of the industrially orientated products (hops, liquorice, saffron, mustard, teasels, and French furze). He was a strong advocate of liquid manure (&#145;muck-water&#146;) and claimed to have devised an engine &#145;in part like they use in London, when houses are on fire&#146;, to spray it on to fields  (<span class="italic">Adam out of Eden</span>, 45). He added legitimacy by referring to &#145;Sir Richard Weston&#146;, &#145;A Gentleman of Richmond&#146;, &#145;An Honourable Knight in Kent&#146; and so on, whose experiments confirmed the veracity of his claims.<br>
<br>Walter Blith, a sober agronome, distrusted Speed, &#145;that superlative Improver&#146;  (Blith, 174). The second and enlarged edition of his <span class="italic">The English Improver Improved</span> (1652) was published in response to Speed's prospectus. Blith ridiculed the latter<blockquote>I being once so weake as to come to an agreement with Mr. Speed, who writes such high things, as reason cannot fathom, to discover his particulars to me, which he gave me in writing &hellip; all of which (except the Pompion) were as well known before to myselfe as to hym, but not, that from them to raise so great advantages, I never knew nor shall. (ibid., 276)</blockquote>Speed's exaggerated and na&iuml;ve claims for agricultural innovation risked its protagonists being &#145;accompted or at least &hellip; Scandalized as a projector&#146;  (ibid., preface). Despite Blith's scepticism, however, Speed's reliance on empirical observation (including his respect for women's recipes and medicinal cures) was genuine; and his exalted aspirations for innovative husbandry accurately reflect the enthusiasm of a network of agricultural improvers in Commonwealth England.<br>
