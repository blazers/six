<span class="headword">Haldane,  James Robert Alexander  Chinnery-</span>  (1842&#150;1906), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Argyll and the Isles</span>, was born on 14 August 1842 at Hatcham, Deptford, London, the only son among the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37503/', "Alexander Haldane (1800&#150;1882)")</script>, barrister and newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Emma Corsbie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardcastle (1800&#150;1867). His father was an Anglican evangelical and had founded <span class="italic">The Record</span>, while his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11895/', "James Alexander Haldane")</script> had been a dissenting minister and controversialist. Initially tutored at home, Haldane attended Bury St Edmunds grammar school before going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1861: he graduated LLB in 1865. At university he relished outdoor pursuits, particularly rowing, and was an interested yet unexceptional scholar. On 23 August 1864 he married Anna Elizabeth Frances Margaretta (<i>d</i>. 1907), heir of the Revd Sir Nicholas Chinnery, bt, of Flintfield, co. Cork. He added his name to hers as Haldane-Chinnery but in 1878 changed it to Chinnery-Haldane. They had three children, Agnes Elizabeth, who died shortly after birth in 1866, James Broderick, and Patrick Vernon.<br>
<br>Soon after his marriage Haldane-Chinnery returned to Cambridge in preparation for ordination. In 1866 he was ordained deacon (priest in 1867) by Bishop W. K. Hamilton of Salisbury, as curate to the Tractarian John Duncan, vicar of Calne, Wiltshire. The choice of curacy was an indication that Haldane-Chinnery had exchanged his filial evangelicalism for an increasing Anglo-Catholicism. He combined the fervent Christo-centric preaching of evangelicalism with Catholic practice in the sacraments and the liturgy, although a natural scrupulousness in religious matters was prevented from becoming religiosity by his urbane cheerfulness. The death of his in-laws in a railway accident in 1868 caused him to consider ministry in his ancestral country.<br>
<br>The Haldane-Chinnerys moved that year to Edinburgh, where Alexander (as he was known) became curate of All Saints, Edinburgh, in the Scottish Episcopal church. During his highland summer holidays Haldane-Chinnery volunteered for pastoral duties to episcopal congregations. He became incumbent of St Bride's, Nether Lochaber, in 1876, and in 1878 moved into the district. In 1879 he was elected incumbent of St John's, Ballachulish, the remaining centre of traditional highland episcopalianism. He was made dean of the diocese of Argyll and the Isles in 1881, and was elected bishop in 1883, being consecrated on 24 August. In 1884 he was granted an LLM from Cambridge University, and in 1888 a DD.<br>
<br>The most extreme Anglo-Catholic yet to be ordained a bishop of the Scottish Episcopal church, Chinnery-Haldane continued for a while his membership of the Society of the Holy Cross and remained a lifelong member of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament. He had a number of good friends among leading English ritualists, including Alexander Heriot Mackonochie of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, London. He developed a reputation as an assiduous pastor in his 23-year episcopate, and attempted to learn Gaelic. He used a bicycle to travel around his large diocese: according to family tradition, he was &#145;physically very strong and could stand a great amount of fatigue&#146;  (Haldane, 262). His only publications were a collection of his diocesan charges and a manual of eucharistic devotions for lay communicants. Chinnery-Haldane died on 16 February 1906, possibly from lung cancer, at Alltshellach House, North Ballachulish, Inverness-shire, which he had purchased in 1876. The funeral was held at St Bride's, Nether Lochaber, in which cemetery he was buried on 21 February. The family history recalled him as &#145;an orthodox Evangelical of the old school&#146;, and added that &#145;there was little of the Puritan about him; he enjoyed a good play, liked to take a hand at cards, and frowned on no amusement that could in any sense be called innocent&#146;  (ibid., 263&#150;4).<br>
