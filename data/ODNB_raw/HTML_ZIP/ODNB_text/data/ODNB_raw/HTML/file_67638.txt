<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Frankel,  Benjamin</span>  (1906&#150;1973), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 31 January 1906 at 705 Fulham Road, Hammersmith, London, the second of three children of Charles Frankel (<i>c</i>.1871&#150;1935) and his wife, Golda Dora Adler (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;1958). His father, born in Warsaw, served in the tsarist army before settling in London as a tobacconist, later becoming a synagogue beadle; his mother was born in the Polish town of Tarnopol, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Like his elder brother and younger sister, Frankel demonstrated a considerable early talent for music, but he was alone in pursuing it seriously.<br>
<br>Frankel was educated at the Latymer foundation school, Hammersmith, leaving to become a watchmaker's apprentice at fourteen. A year later he began studying the violin and the piano at Trinity College of Music, London; he subsequently concentrated on the piano under the American virtuoso Victor Benham, who taught him for two years at no cost, latterly in Cologne and Berlin. After returning to England in 1923, Frankel earned a living for many years as a jazz violinist, pianist, and arranger, for Carroll Gibbons and Henry Hall among others. His formal training continued with Orlando Morgan on a composition scholarship (1929&#150;34) from the Worshipful Company of Musicians at the Guildhall School of Music in London, where later he became principal composition teacher (1946&#150;57).<br>
<br>Frankel was a leading committee member of the International Society for Contemporary Music from 1952 to 1955, serving as a vice-president during 1954&#150;5. A leading and prolific film composer from 1934, he composed 104 film scores including music for <span class="italic">The Seventh Veil</span> (1945), <span class="italic">The Man in the White Suit</span> (1951), <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Night of the Iguana</span> (1964), and <span class="italic">Battle of the Bulge</span> (1965). During the 1930s and 1940s he was also musical director for shows by C. B. Cochran, No&euml;l Coward, and others in London's West End.<br>
<br>Frankel's earliest surviving concert work dates from 1926, but he gained recognition with his clarinet trio (1943), first sonata for solo violin (1945), and first four string quartets (1944&#150;9), their introspective lyricism revealing an individual style. His violin concerto (1951)&#151;commissioned by the violinist Max Rostal for the Festival of Britain&#151;was his first major work and cemented his reputation. Inscribed &#145;to the Six Million&#146;, it was a heartfelt lament for the victims of the holocaust.<br>
<br>Frankel was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain for twelve years; and works by him such as <span class="italic">May Day</span> (1947) indicated his political affiliations. In 1952, however, outraged by the show trials and summary executions of alleged spies in Prague, he publicly resigned from the party in a letter to the <span class="italic">New Statesman and Nation</span> (published on 13 December 1952). A secular Jew who none the less identified absolutely with his roots, Frankel was drawn late in life to Roman Catholicism, though he never converted.<br>
<br>Always dapper, Frankel had a strong personality and an imposing, high-domed forehead which disguised a diminutive stature. He was married three times. His first marriage, on 13 February 1932, to Joyce Stanmore Rayner (<i>b</i>. 1908), was dissolved in 1944. They had two sons and one daughter. The second, on 14 October 1944, was to Phyllis Anna Leat (1905&#150;1967). His third marriage, to Xenia Hamilton-Kennaway, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Szladkowska (<i>b</i>. 1926), a musician, took place in 1972.<br>
<br>After leaving the parental home at 190 Hammersmith Road on his marriage, Frankel was itinerant for many years, eventually settling at 17 Soho Square, London, with his second wife, then at Rodmell Hill, Rodmell, near Lewes, from 1953 to 1957, where he entertained a lively artistic circle that included the poet Cecil Day Lewis, the film director Anthony Asquith, and the political writer Leonard Woolf (his neighbour). He settled in 1958 in Locarno, initially at Verbanella Alta, Minusio (1958&#150;63), then at via ai Monti 31 (1963 onwards).<br>
<br>After adopting Schoenbergian serialism (broadly, the use of all twelve musical pitches in predetermined order), Frankel began his important cycle of eight symphonies &#145;that crystallised his position as one of the major English symphonists of our time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 13 Feb 1973). These works were completed in the period 1958&#150;71: no. 1 in 1958; no. 2 in 1962; no. 3 in 1964; no. 4 in 1966; no. 5 in 1967; no. 6 in 1969; no. 7 in 1970; and no. 8 in 1971.<br>
<br>Other significant works by Frankel included his viola concerto (1967) and his last work, the opera <span class="italic">Marching Song</span> (1971&#150;3), after the play by John Whiting and to a libretto by Hans Keller. He left many chamber works, of which the piano quartet (1954), clarinet quintet (1956), and fifth string quartet (1965) are outstanding examples, as well as song cycles, orchestral overtures, and an instrumental mass. Many works were commissioned for the Cheltenham Festival. He also broadcast many stimulating talks for BBC radio.<br>
<br>The onset of heart disease in 1959 led to a long and courageous battle against severe odds, as when Frankel continued writing his sixth symphony while critically ill in hospital. His final years were divided between his house in Locarno and long visits to London for medical treatment and musical engagements. Despite the increasing success of his music, Frankel was frequently in debt on account of his generosity, lack of financial acumen, heavy medical bills, and love of the good life. He left debts approaching &pound;50,000 (though these were eventually settled by posthumous royalties).<br>
<br>Frankel died, following a coronary thrombosis, in New End Hospital, London, on 12 February 1973. His ashes were buried in Golders Green crematorium, London, on 13 March 1973.<br>
