<span class="headword">Ravis <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Raue]</span>,  Christian</span> <span class="st"> [Christianus Ravius]</span>  (1613&#150;1677), <span class="occ">oriental and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 25 January 1613 at Berlin, Brandenburg, the son of Johann Raue, deacon at the Nikolaus-Kirche, and his wife, Margarete Guericke. After attending the Berlin Gymnasium, in 1630 he entered Wittenberg University, where he studied oriental languages under Trostius (author of a Syriac lexicon and a Hebrew grammar), and graduated MA in 1633. From 1636 he visited the universities of Leipzig, K&ouml;nigsberg, and Rostock, and travelled in Denmark and Sweden, before going to Holland in 1637 to study Arabic under Golius. He there made the acquaintance of the eminent scholar G. J. Vossius and of Johann Elichmann, a physician interested in oriental languages.<br>
<br>In July 1638, supported by recommendations from these and the English ambassador William Boswell, Ravis (as his name became Anglicized) went to England, whence he wrote to Archbishop Ussher in Ireland, requesting support for proposed scholarly travels in the east. Ussher, acting through Samuel Hartlib, granted him an annual stipend of &pound;24 in return for a promise to look for manuscripts that Ussher wanted. Ravis set out for Constantinople in 1639, travelling via Paris, where Hugo Grotius introduced him to Cardinal Richelieu, who, according to Ravis, tried to recruit him into his service. He also made the acquaintance of Mersenne and Desargues, and issued as Christianus Ravius (the name by which he was known in the continental scholarly world and which he himself adopted) his first publication, a pamphlet pompously entitled <span class="italic">Dissertatio mathematica proponens novum summumque totius matheseos inventum problemata omnia certa methodo inveniendi, &amp; inventa solvendi</span>, which praised John Pell. Taking ship from Marseilles, Ravis reached Constantinople in July, almost destitute. But the Arabist Edward Pococke, who was living with the English ambassador Sir Sackville Crowe, arranged for him to be taken into that household. He began to study Turkish and Arabic, and to collect manuscripts. In September he travelled to Smyrna with Edward Stringer, who had been appointed English consul there, but soon returned to Constantinople, where he remained until early 1641 when he embarked on a tour of Asia Minor in the company of Charles Cavendish, son of the earl of Devonshire.<br>
<br>A four-month voyage from Smyrna brought Ravis to London late in 1641. He carried with him some 300 manuscripts, mostly oriental, of which the most notable was an Arabic version of Apollonius' <span class="italic">Conics</span>. He also brought Nicolaus Petri, an Arabic-speaking Greek from Aleppo, whom he had persuaded to be his amanuensis. Nicolaus's Arabic letters to Pococke and Golius paint a vivid picture of Ravis's penury, duplicity, and vain attempts to find employment in England and later in Holland. Ravis petitioned parliament to set up a college for converting the Jews and oriental learning, with no result. He was given money by John Selden, but was forced to pledge or sell a number of his manuscripts to Sir Simonds D'Ewes, Richard Holdsworth, and others, and, despairing of finding employment in England, moved to the Netherlands. Ravis was in Leiden in March 1642, but had no greater success there or in Denmark. Subsequently he was permitted to give lectures (some of which he published) on oriental languages at Utrecht (1643&#150;4) and Amsterdam (1645&#150;6), and was rewarded with an occasional honorarium, but his requests for a permanent appointment, although supported by Vossius, were unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In June 1647 Ravis returned to England, ostensibly to redeem his manuscripts, but in fact encouraged by Hartlib with the prospect of a new post teaching oriental languages in London. This was established in July by the provincial presbyterian synod of London, centred on Sion College, and was probably subsidized by Thomas Adams and other wealthy citizens of London. Ravis began to lecture in August at London House; the content of his lectures, some of which were in English, may be surmised from his book, <span class="italic">A Generall Grammer for the Ebrew, Samaritan, Calde, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic Tongue</span>, which went into several editions from 1648 to 1650, and was published with his <span class="italic">Discourse of the Orientall Tongues</span>, and a collection of letters from scholars. In this work he propounded his peculiar theory that these six languages are not merely related, but are in fact the same language (which may be called &#145;Arabic&#146;). Among his pupils in London were Hanserd Knollys and Thomas Danson. However, the financial basis of this lectureship was shaky, and an appeal by the ministers of London to parliament for support (seconded by a personal appeal by Ravis to an influential parliamentarian, John Selden) was unsuccessful, so Ravis sought other prospects.<br>
<br>When it seemed likely that Pococke would lose his Arabic professorship at Oxford for royalist sympathies, Ravis aspired to replace him, but was warned off by Selden and Ussher. However, he had sufficient influence in the parliamentary committee supervising Oxford University that on 5 March 1649 he became one of those chosen to replace almost the whole body of fellows of Magdalen College. He was also made librarian of the college and Hebrew lecturer.<br>
<br>Ravis was soon (if not already) negotiating for a better post. Johannes Matthiae, bishop of Str&auml;ngn&auml;s, who was a friend of Hartlib and of Ravis's brother Johannes (professor at Rostock), persuaded Queen Kristina of Sweden (whose tutor he had been) to offer Ravis employment. In February 1650 he travelled to Sweden via Amsterdam, where he bought the Hebrew press of Menasseh ben Israel on behalf of Kristina. The queen appointed him professor of oriental languages at Uppsala University in November 1650. In 1651 he married Matthiae's niece, Christina Andreae. Nevertheless, his financial difficulties continued. He had left his books and manuscripts behind in England as pledges for his debts, but Selden redeemed them in 1652. In January 1654 Ravis was glad to accept &pound;5 from the English ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke, to whom he expressed regret for leaving England. He was quarrelling with the theological faculty, who resented his intrusion into their territory by publishing on biblical matters. In 1655 he was appointed royal librarian, moving to Stockholm in 1656. In 1659 King Karl Gustav reappointed him professor of oriental languages at Uppsala, where he remained until 1669. His quarrels with the theologians worsened, particularly after he began to propound his peculiar theories on biblical chronology. After leaving for Kiel in 1669, he published these as <span class="italic">Unica vera et infallibilis chronologia biblica</span> (1670), which met with almost universal derision. He devoted the rest of his life, and several publications, to defending this. While at Kiel he also (1669) published a bad Latin translation of part of the Arabic <span class="italic">Conics</span>, and a catalogue of his manuscripts which he was offering for sale. In 1672 the elector of Brandenburg appointed him professor of oriental languages and biblical chronology at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder, where he died of scurvy on 21 June 1677 and was buried in S. Marien-Kirche. He was survived by his wife (who died on 21 March 1678) and four children. Most of his manuscripts survived in Berlin, but his treasured Apollonius went to the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
<br>Ravis was a facile linguist (his English writings are thoroughly idiomatic), but not a profound one. He strove for the original, but usually achieved only the bizarre. Except for the books he wrote in England, most of his numerous publications were issued by himself in minuscule editions, paid for by himself, and are extremely rare: of some only one copy, or none, is known. His acquaintance among European scholars was large, but his friends few: his assiduous flattery was offset by his boastfulness, extravagant promises of the unattainable, and duplicity&#151;his amanuensis called him a &#145;treasury of lies&#146;  (Houtsma, 92).<br>
