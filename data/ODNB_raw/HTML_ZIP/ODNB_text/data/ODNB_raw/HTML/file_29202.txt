</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whichcote,  Benjamin</span>  (1609&#150;1683), <span class="occ">theologian and moral philosopher</span>, was born in Stoke, Shropshire, in March 1609, the sixth son of at least seven children of Christopher Whichcote of Whichcote Hall and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fox). In 1626 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where his tutors were first Anthony Tuckney and subsequently Thomas Hill. He graduated BA in 1629, proceeded MA and became a fellow in 1633, and was ordained deacon by Bishop John Williams in 1636. At Emmanuel his pupils included Samuel Cradock, John Wallis, Jeremiah Horrocks, John Smith, and John Worthington but a constellation of younger men came under his wider influence. Notable among them were the so-called <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94274', "Cambridge Platonists")</script>&#151;Worthington, Ralph Cudworth, Peter Sterry, and Nathaniel Culverwell. Their circle also took in other members of Whichcote's family&#151;his niece Mary (the daughter of his brother Christopher) who married Worthington, his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53695/', "Elizabeth Foxcroft (1600&#150;1679)")</script> (at one time the companion of Anne Conway), her husband, George Foxcroft, and their son Ezekiel Foxcroft.<br>
<br>Having proceeded BD in 1640 Whichcote was, on 26 October 1641, a candidate for the professorship of divinity at Gresham College, but he lost the election to Thomas Horton. From 1643 he lectured at Trinity Church, Cambridge, on Sunday and Wednesday afternoons. That year he married Rebecca Cradock, widow of Matthew Cradock (<i>d</i>. 1641), first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and was also presented to the living of North Cadbury, Somerset. He did not resign his fellowship until the following year, and a dispute over the right of presentation prevented him from taking up his preferment until 1645. On 19 March 1645 he was appointed provost of King's College by parliament in place of Samuel Collins, ejected by the earl of Manchester. Whichcote did not himself subscribe to the covenant, possibly because he was absent from Cambridge at the time. In 1649 he became DD by mandate. In 1650 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge. The sermon that he preached on this occasion resulted, in 1651, in an exchange of letters with Anthony Tuckney, who expressed alarm at Whichcote's subordination of faith to reason. In reply Whichcote defended the role of reason in religious matters and his advocacy of ecumenism, which was based on an agreed minimum set of beliefs. The theological liberalism that he enunciated in response to Tuckney's doctrinaire Calvinism characterizes the Cambridge Platonists and their latitudinarian successors. On 20 September 1651 Whichcote was presented to the living of Milton, near Cambridge. In 1654 he contributed a poem to the collection <span class="italic">Oliva pacis</span> celebrating Oliver Cromwell's peace with the Netherlands. In 1655 he was one of sixteen divines on the committee set up to advise Cromwell on the readmission of the Jews to England. In 1659, along with Edward Stillingfleet and John Tillotson, he backed Matthew Poole's scheme for supporting able students at university. He was a friend of Samuel Hartlib, and encouraged Thomas Gouge's educational project in Wales.<br>
<br>As provost of King's, Whichcote was an able administrator who steered his college through difficult times, and won the respect of fellows for his considerate treatment of his predecessor, Samuel Collins, and for winning exemption for fellows of King's from subscribing to the covenant. In 1660 Whichcote's academic career came to an abrupt end when he was supplanted in the provostship of King's by James Fleetwood on 26 June. With support from Lord Lauderdale, Whichcote attempted to oppose the appointment of Fleetwood. The vice-provost of King's, Matthew Barlow, and twenty-one fellows supported his petition, commending his &#145;peaceable and prudent management&#146; during his time as provost  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July 1660</i>, petition 94.II). In spite of the fact that his deprived predecessor had died, he was forced to resign in favour of the royal nominee, Fleetwood, who successfully argued that Whichcote could not hold the provostship because college statutes required that the provost be elected from among the fellows of King's. Whichcote was permitted to retain the living of Milton, after resigning it in November 1661 in order that it might be re-presented to him a few days later.<br>
<br>Although he complied with the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, Whichcote did not obtain another university appointment after his ejection from King's College. Instead, he found employment as a clergyman. On 8 November 1662 he was appointed curate of St Ann Blackfriars. After the fire of London he retired to his living at Milton. In December 1668, with the help of the outgoing incumbent, his friend John Wilkins, he obtained the living of St Lawrence Jewry in London, where he preached twice weekly and where John Locke attended his sermons. While the church was being rebuilt he was permitted to preach at the Guildhall. In 1670, acting as the executor of John Larkin, he founded fellowships and scholarships at Emmanuel College, funded by a bequest of &pound;1000 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. In 1673 he preached before parliament. He died in May 1683 in Cambridge at the house of his friend Ralph Cudworth, and was buried on 24 May at St Lawrence Jewry. His funeral sermon was preached by John Tillotson, future archbishop of Canterbury. In his will he bequeathed land to finance poor relief and education in Milton. He had no children. His nephew, Benjamin Whichcote of Bishopsgate, one of his executors, passed his papers to John Jeffrey for publication, though some were still in the hands of his great-nephew, Francis Whichcote, bt, in 1753.<br>
<br>Whichcote impressed those who met him with his mild and courteous disposition. He was, according to Gilbert Burnet, &#145;a man of rare temper&#146;. During the strife-riven years of the civil war and its aftermath Whichcote was an important eirenic presence in the University of Cambridge. In religion Whichcote placed emphasis on interior spirituality rather than the externals of religion, and on Christian practice rather than on the institutions of the church. For him the core of Christianity was its moral content. He published nothing in his lifetime: his writings consist of posthumously published collections of his sermons and works derived from these. A teacher rather than a systematizer, his most important published legacy comprised the moral and religious aphorisms derived from his sermons. These amount to a consistent body of ethical teachings in which he asserted the permanence of moral distinctions and the rational nature of moral understanding. By reason he meant practical reason, the end of which is the exercise of virtue. Although he never denied the role of revelation he regarded religion as intrinsically rational: reason is the means by which the truth of religion is communicated to men. Indeed, he believed that it was possible to arrive at the truth by reason without scripture. He was, accordingly, optimistic in his view of human nature. He believed, nevertheless, that human beings are fallible, and that therefore it behoved them to be charitable, and therefore tolerant, towards the religious convictions of others.<br>
<br>Whichcote's tolerant, optimistic, and rational theology, with its emphasis on practical ethics, shaped the theology of the Cambridge Platonists, through whom his theological legacy extends to the latitudinarian movement of the latter half of the seventeenth century. His philosophical admirers included his friends Ralph Cudworth and John Locke, Samuel Clarke, who published a volume of his sermons in 1707, and Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, who edited another volume of his sermons in 1698. He was also held in esteem by John Ray and William Whiston and continued to attract a readership throughout the eighteenth century, when several collections of his writings were published, including a four-volume collection of his sermons which was published by Samuel Salter in 1753. In the nineteenth century he was highly esteemed by the Anglican scholars J. B. Lightfoot, B. F. Westcott, and H. J. A. Hort, and, in the twentieth century, by W. R. Inge.<br>
