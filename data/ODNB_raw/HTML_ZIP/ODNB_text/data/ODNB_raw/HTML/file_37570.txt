<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Horne,  Herbert Percy</span>  (1864&#150;1916), <span class="occ">architect, art collector, and art historian</span>, was born at 10 Russell Square, London, on 18 February 1864, the son of Horace Horne (<i>d</i>. 1894), architect, and his wife, Hannah Louisa Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1903). After attending Miss Moore's day school in Hereford Square and Kensington grammar school, he was articled to the London architect George Vigers.<br>
<br>In the early 1880s Horne began working for A. H. Mackmurdo, a very intellectual architect with strong social concerns, and in the mid-1880s they went into partnership. Thus he was probably involved from the start with the Century Guild, a loose association of architects, designers, and craftsmen set up by Mackmurdo about 1882; the artist Selwyn Image was also involved. The guild proposed to make architecture and the decorative arts &#145;the sphere, no longer of the tradesman, but, of the artist&#146;  (Century Guild prospectus, William Morris Gallery, K339). This was the language of William Morris and the arts and crafts movement, and Horne owed some allegiance to Morris at this stage. But he had probably already read Walter Pater's <span class="italic">Studies in the History of the Renaissance</span>, and discovered a less social, more exclusively aesthetic philosophy.<br>
<br>Horne made important designs for textiles and wall-coverings for the Century Guild, but the work with which his name was most closely associated was the editing of the <span class="italic">Century Guild Hobby Horse</span> which he shared with Mackmurdo. This finely printed quarterly magazine of art and literature ran, with gaps and a change of title, from 1884 to 1894. Its layout, from the issue of January 1888 onwards, was something of a milestone in British graphic design, presenting type, paper, and illustrations as a coherent whole. Horne, along with the engraver Emery Walker, may have been responsible for this. In the <span class="italic">Hobby Horse</span> he published lyric poems in which the imagery is both religious and sensuous, and thoughtful, discriminating essays which manage to embrace both the rational disciplines of English classical architecture and the visionary work of William Blake. The seventeenth century was his ideal moment in English culture, Robert Herrick and Inigo Jones his heroes. Meeting him in 1888, Bernard Berenson admired the range of Horne's talents and thought he might become William Morris's successor, &#145;the great man of the next generation&#146;  (E. Samuels, <span class="italic">Bernard Berenson</span>, 1979, 62).<br>
<br>This was Horne by day. By night he could be found in the saloon bar of The Crown in Charing Cross Road, with Lionel Johnson, Ernest Dowson, and Arthur Symons, Bohemian poets and litt&eacute;rateurs, or lecturing on art to the people of the East End, or escorting young dancers from the music-hall with Stewart Headlam and Selwyn Image. Headlam and Image were engaged in a peculiar Christian crusade against puritanism; Horne was perhaps naturally at home in the <i>demi-monde</i>. He seems to have lived with his parents, from about 1880 in Bedford Park in west London, and later at 14 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea; but in the 1890s he also had chambers in King's Bench Walk, Temple, with Chippendale furniture and chiaroscuro woodcuts after Raphael and Mantegna, an aesthete's retreat. He had many mistresses during his life, but no lasting relationship, and he was, perhaps, bisexual. Dark, reticent, worldly-looking, with pale skin and disturbingly red lips, he appears in memoirs of the nineties as a figure of more weight than warmth. To Arthur Symons and Edgar Jepson he seemed cold and self-restrained; William Rothenstein noted his secretiveness. But W. B. Yeats praised his knowledge and taste; and both Arnold Dolmetsch, the pioneer of the revival of early music, and the artist Lucien Pissarro&#151;Frenchmen struggling to establish themselves in London&#151;had reason to be grateful to Horne for his early support.<br>
<br>The partnership with Mackmurdo was dissolved about 1892, and most of Horne's work as an architect and designer did not extend beyond the middle of the 1890s. In the early 1890s he designed several books which combine elegance with self-conscious archaism. His most substantial building was the Chapel of the Ascension in Hyde Park Place, Bayswater Road, London, designed in 1889&#150;90 along loosely quattrocento lines to provide wall space for the fervently evangelical paintings of Frederic Shields. (The chapel was bombed in 1940 and demolished in 1969.) These were years of transition; Horne was moving away from architecture and design towards critical writing, art-historical scholarship, and collecting and dealing in art. His imagination now dwelt more readily in fifteenth-century Italy than in seventeenth-century England. And he was seen less often in The Crown. If he made new friends, they were critics and dealers in art such as Roger Fry and Bernard Berenson. About 1894 he was asked by the publishers George Bell &amp; Sons to write a short book on Botticelli in a popular series. He decided instead to write a long and definitive book, and as a result began to spend part of the year in Florence.<br>
<br>The pull of Florence was strong. Art history took more of Horne's time in the early 1900s, and about 1904 he sold his English watercolours, including an important collection of the work of Alexander Cozens, to Edward Marsh, and moved permanently to Florence. In 1908 George Bell &amp; Sons published his <span class="italic">Alessandro Filipepi Commonly called Sandro Botticelli, Painter of Florence</span> in a small edition of 240 copies. It was a big, expensive book, designed by Horne with all the old, mannered elegance of the <span class="italic">Hobby Horse</span>, a narrative of Botticelli's life and work studded with lyrical descriptions of the major paintings. Like Fry, Horne was concerned with formal qualities, but also with attribution, studying characteristic details in the manner of Berenson and Giovanni Morelli. What distinguished Horne's work was the thoroughness of his archival research and the severely factual nature of his narrative. &#145;&#147;What is it that we really know?&#148; is the question always in Mr. Horne's mind&#146; wrote Roger Fry in a review  (<span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, 13, 1908, 84). Though it was written about a hundred years ago, when English art-historical scholarship was not even in its infancy, the book survives today as one of the standard works on Botticelli, challenged only in details by subsequent research, though not always studied at first hand. For John Pope-Hennessy it was &#145;the best monograph in English on an Italian painter&#146;  (Pope-Hennessy, ix), while Fritz Saxl, lecturing in London in 1944&#151;before the rise of Anthony Blunt&#151;described Horne as &#145;the most accomplished historian of art whom this country has ever produced&#146;  (Saxl, 332).<br>
<br>Saxl spoke movingly of the passage in Horne's life from London to Florence, from a connoisseur in the mould of Walter Pater to an art historian devoted to archival research, but he suggested perhaps too movingly the single-mindedness of Horne's new life: &#145;Day after day he would go to the archives&#146;  (Saxl, 335). In fact, Horne lived much the same life in Florence as he had in London: he had his mistresses; he did some designing, including several distinguished typefaces; and he was busier than ever collecting and dealing in works of art, working in an edgy, unstable triangle with Roger Fry and Bernard Berenson, easing the passage of works of art from Italy to Britain and the United States. He lived by himself in lodgings on the Lung'arno degli Archibusieri, waiting to find a fine house which he could afford to buy. Eventually, in 1911, he purchased the fifteenth-century Palazzo Corsi on the corner of the via de' Benci and set about restoring it and filling it, not only with his own important collection of works of art, but also with furniture and household objects appropriate to its date. He would create a house of the quattrocento, an interior which might embody the civilizing values of the Florentine Renaissance. It would also be the last stage in the series of transformations that were his life.<br>
<br>Horne did not move into the palazzo until 1915, by which time he was seriously ill and often confined to two small, plain rooms at the very top, where he was part host, part caretaker of the riches on the floors below. Aby Warburg visited him in 1915 and found him &#145;very ill, exceedingly noble, and divorced from everything material&#146;  (Saxl, 342). A year later, when he was clearly dying, Mary Berenson persuaded him to write a will, and he bequeathed the palazzo and its contents to the Italian state. It is now open to the public as the Museo Horne.<br>
<br>Horne died, unmarried, at his palazzo in Florence, on 14 April 1916. The funeral was, according to Mary Berenson, &#145;rather awful, the assistance being chiefly Sods (excuse the word) and dealers, &hellip; myself and one or two Museum officials of grubby aspect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mary Berenson</span>, 208). He was buried in the Gli Allori protestant cemetery in Florence.<br>
