<span class="headword">Bleddyn <span class="st"> [Blethin]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1590), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born at Shirenewton Court, Monmouthshire, the son of Griffith Bleddyn (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1510&#150;<i>c</i>.1560), freeholder, a descendant of Hywel Dda, king of Deheubarth (900&#150;950), and a distant relative of Morgan Bleddyn, abbot of Llantarnam. His mother was Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1510&#150;<i>c</i>.1565), daughter of Thomas ab Ieuan Hywel. In 1559 he was appointed rector of Sunningwell, Berkshire, and, in 1560, non-resident rector of Rogiet, Monmouthshire, and canon of St Dubricius, Llandaff Cathedral. In 1562 he graduated BCL from New Inn Hall or Broadgates Hall, Oxford, and became prebendary of Osbaldwick in York Cathedral. His first wife was Anne (<i>d</i>. 1589), daughter of Robert Young of Pembrokeshire and niece of Thomas Young, bishop of St David's (1559&#150;61) and archbishop of York (1561&#150;8).<br>
<br>Bleddyn was licensed to preach and became resident rector of Rogiet (1563&#150;70) and archdeacon of Brecon (collated on 25 or 27 July 1567). On 13 April 1575 he was elected bishop of Llandaff, confirmed on 16 April and consecrated on 17 April by Archbishop Parker. The temporalities of the see were restored to him on 2 May. Owing to the poverty of his diocese he retained his offices and preferments. As bishop, he attempted to reform the canons and vicars-choral of his cathedral and to protect its property. In a letter of 30 January 1576 Bleddyn severely admonished the prebendaries for seriously neglecting their duties. He reminded them of the ordinances and customs of Llandaff and declared that if the prebendaries had governed the church according to those rules its condition would not have been so critical. He sternly opposed Catholic recusancy, a major threat to the Elizabethan church, and attempted to suppress it with great vigour.<br>
<br>Although Bleddyn was an ardent reformer he was also eager to advance his own interests. He purchased the manor of Bisham, near Caer-went, made his sons Morgan and Philemon prebendaries of Llandaff, and installed Philemon as vicar of Caer-went and rector of Shirenewton. Bleddyn spoke Welsh and patronized the bards, tributes being paid to him and his wife by Dafydd Benwyn; he himself composed an <i>englyn</i> (stanza) praising Lewys Dwnn, the famous genealogist. Bleddyn's first wife died in 1589 and on 14 October of the same year he married his second wife, Anne, who survived him. He died on 15 October 1590 and was buried in the chancel in Matharn church, near the bishop's palace. His will was proved on 21 May 1591.<br>
