<span class="headword">Verbruggen,  Jan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1712, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">gun-founder</span>, was baptized on 4 March 1712 in Enkhuizen in the Netherlands, but little is known about his origins or early years. He was taught by the Dutch seascapist Jan van Call the younger. He married Eva van Schaak (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1739) in 1734; they had three children. Appointed master founder of the Dutch admiralty's Enkhuizen cannon foundry in 1740, in 1754 Verbruggen also took over the recently modernized state ordnance foundry at The Hague. However, after a few years he was suspended because of accusations of hiding flaws in guns.<br>
<br>In 1763 Verbruggen offered his services to the British government, without success; yet by 1769 circumstances had changed in Britain. Andrew Schalch, master founder, scarcely cast any guns, while, more seriously, the Board of Ordnance's two contract founders, Richard Gilpin and William Bowen, were reaching the end of their careers. It appeared that within a year there would be no one in Britain capable of casting brass guns. On 12 January 1770, in consequence, Jan and his son, <a href="#cosubject_47493">Pieter [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were appointed master founders of the royal brass foundry at Woolwich at a joint wage of 12<i>s</i>. a day, the same rate as that at which Schalch had been engaged in 1718. They arrived in May 1770 and embarked on a programme to modernize the royal brass foundry. Their most important innovation was the introduction of horizontal boring for guns cast solid; previously guns were cast round a core and reamed out vertically. Solid boring for brass guns had been developed by the Swiss founder Jean Maritz in 1712 and adopted at The Hague in the 1750s. Other changes included rebuilding the furnaces and casting pits and the use of precast moulds for cascables, which permitted larger numbers of higher-quality guns to be cast more quickly.<br>
<br>The first Verbruggen guns passed proof in April 1774. Their cannon, mortars, and howitzers had a much better proof record than those of past founders. For the first time since its early years the royal brass foundry was able to provide all the brass guns required by the British services, and produced over one hundred guns a year during the American War of Independence. The Verbruggens carried out other services for the board, making machine parts, boring up foreign guns, and analysing metal from brass and iron guns.<br>
<br>Jan Verbruggen died at Woolwich on 27 October 1781 and was buried in the Dutch church at Austin Friars in the City of London. His son, Pieter, continued as master founder. <a name="cosubject_47493"></a><span class="headword">Pieter Verbruggen</span>  (1735&#150;1786)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 12 March 1735 at Enkhuizen, in the Netherlands, and educated in law at the University of Leiden. He subsequently worked with his father at The Hague. Under Pieter Verbruggen the royal brass foundry reached its apogee, finishing a total of 237 guns in 1782. However, with the ending of the American war there was a severe reduction. In 1783 147 guns were cast, but between 1784 and Pieter's death the annual total never rose above 13. From October 1783 the skilled workforce assembled by the Verbruggens began to be dispersed. Moreover, Pieter was in dispute with the board over payments; in September 1785 he complained he had had no money since 1782. Pieter Verbruggen married Wynefrede Kooystra on 21 September 1785 at Austin Friars; they had no children. He died on 20 February the following year, at Woolwich. He also was buried at the Dutch church at Austin Friars. His sisters, Catherine and Maria, took two years to settle his affairs with the board and returned to the Netherlands. The Verbruggens had been training a successor, Frederick Groves from the drawing office at Plymouth. However, after Pieter Verbruggen's death the royal brass foundry was reorganized; the position of master founder was abolished and the foundry came under the control of Thomas Blomefield, inspector of artillery. Groves resigned in disappointment.<br>
<br>A remarkable series of water-colours depicting the royal brass foundry under the Verbruggens, which have often been attributed to Jan or Pieter, has survived in the possession of the family. However, the high standard of water-colour technique, use of perspective, and fine detail are unlike the conventional Dutch seascapes Jan normally painted. Moreover the drawings seem to depict father and son at work. A more likely attribution is to one of three water-colourists associated with the Board of Ordnance: Paul Sandby, professor of drawing at Woolwich; Thomas Sandby, from the drawing office in the Tower of London; or Michael Angelo Rooker, who carried out highly detailed engravings of experiments for the board in 1778.<br>
