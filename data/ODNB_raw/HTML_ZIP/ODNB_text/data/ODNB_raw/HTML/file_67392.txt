<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  George, of Cessnock</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1671&#150;1704), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the eldest of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67246/', "Sir Hugh Campbell (d. 1686)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, younger daughter and coheir of George Campbell, master of Loudoun. In 1665 he married Lady Anna McMurran (McMoran, McMouran), heir of a Fife estate, with whom he had five children. As substantial contributors to the parish kirk at Galston, Ayrshire, Sir George and his father petitioned the privy council in December 1671 for seats proportional to their contributions. Like his father, Sir George refused to sign a bond pledging not to support conventicles, for which he was outlawed in February 1678. Accused of aiding the covenanter ministers Donald Cargill and John Welsh, the Campbells denied the charge and were absolved. Sir George and his father reputedly provided 400 lances to the Bothwell Bridge rebels in the spring of 1679.<br>
<br>Three years later the Campbells became involved with other supporters of the earl of Argyll in discussions about a possible insurrection. On 28 April 1682 Alexander Monro of Bearcrofts wrote to Sir George Campbell about a plan to establish a Scottish colony; originally the intent had been to situate it in New York, but the focus was now on Carolina. Sir John Cochrane and Sir George were invited to London to participate in negotiations with the earl of Shaftesbury. By August they had reached an agreement and obtained King Charles's approval (15 August), probably because he shared Hamilton's belief that the colony would attract Scottish dissidents. Argyll was also in London, meeting secretly with Shaftesbury, apparently seeking funds to support a rebellion in Scotland. Sir George and his father were probably working with Argyll by this time. In late January or early February 1683 the duke of Monmouth, Algernon Sidney, John Hampden, and their fellow conspirators sent Aaron Smith to Scotland to invite the Campbells, Cochrane, Monro, and other Argyll supporters to London to explore the possibility of joint insurrections. The Scots arrived in April and May on the pretext of discussing the Carolina colony. Sir George conferred with the plotter Robert Ferguson, and both Campbells met with William Carstares, one of Argyll's agents, who was himself in contact with Ferguson. Distrustful of the English, the Campbells opposed an alliance with Monmouth. Argyll's supporters were still trying to raise money when the government learned of the Rye House plotting. The tangled skein of conspiracies soon led to the Campbells, who were arrested on 26 June.<br>
<br>Taken to Scotland with his father in September, Sir George Campbell remained in prison without trial until 1685, when he and his father were charged in the Scottish parliament with complicity in plotting an insurrection. After they threw themselves on King James's mercy, he spared their lives, though their estates were annexed and entrusted to Viscount Melfort. Released from prison with his father in August 1685, Sir George was reconfined in October after Cochrane confessed. He was liberated again in January 1686. Following the revolution of 1688, Sir George was appointed justice clerk with a pension of &pound;400 p.a. (December 1689), commissioner of the excise in Ayrshire (January 1690), and sheriff of Ayrshire (June 1690). As a member of the privy council he attended fifty-six meetings in 1690, but only sixteen the following year owing to ill health. Secretary of state James Johnston forced his resignation as justice clerk in 1693. Sir George was again appointed to the privy council in 1696 and 1698. Although parliament had restored his estate in 1690, he was heavily in debt by the late 1690s. His date of death is uncertain: possibly in 1704, though he may still have been alive as late as 1710. No sons survived him; his daughter and heir, Margaret, married in 1697 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4463/', "Alexander Hume, later Alexander Hume Campbell, second earl of Marchmont")</script>, to whom she carried the paternal estate in 1729.<br>
