</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baretti,  Giuseppe Marc'Antonio</span>  (1719&#150;1789), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Turin, Italy, on 24 April 1719, the eldest son of Luca Baretti (1688&#150;1744) and Anna Caterina Tesio (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;1735); he was baptized on the same day. His grandfather, Marc' Antonio (1656&#150;1704), a physician from Rivalta Bormida, a small village now in the Piedmontese province of Alessandria, married Diana Maria Arcasio from the nearby town of Bistagno. They moved to Mombercelli in the province of Asti, where Luca Baretti was born on 17 October 1688. By 1692 Marc'Antonio had returned to his home town of Rivalta, where he became mayor. His son Luca studied architecture in Turin and was employed as bursar by the Turin Royal University. In 1716 Luca married Anna Caterina Tesio, a person of humble origins, and of this union four sons were born: Giuseppe, Filippo, Giovanni Battista, and Amedeo.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>As was common at the time, Giuseppe Baretti at a very young age was destined by his father for the priesthood, which would guarantee a livelihood and an education. When the boy resisted this plan it was thought that he might study to become an architect like his father, but the idea was abandoned owing to Giuseppe's extreme short-sightedness. A month after Baretti's mother died in May 1735, his father, Luca, married Genoveffa Astrua, who brought into the Baretti household Miglyna di Capriglio, her <i>cicisbeo</i> (or male companion of the kind then customarily kept by well-to-do women), as her attendant. Disgusted by what apparently turned out to be a <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i>, the young Baretti left the parental home following a quarrel and went to live with his uncle, Giambattista, at Guastalla, near Mantua, where he worked as a clerk for a local merchant. Employed in the same office was the poet Carlo Cantoni, who instilled in Baretti a love for Italian literature, especially burlesque poetry. Two years later, in 1737, Baretti returned to Turin, where for a year he attended some of the university lectures given by the professor of literature Girolamo Tagliazucchi, whom he regarded highly.<h2>
<a name="LiteraryactivitiesinItaly"></a>Literary activities in Italy</h2>The years 1738 and 1739 were spent in Venice, where Baretti made the acquaintance of the young Gasparo Gozzi, who was destined to become one of the chief literary figures of the period. In 1740 Baretti moved to Milan. Here he mixed with writers such as Passeroni, Tanzi, Bicetti, and Balestrieri, who soon after established the respected literary circle the Accademia dei Trasformati. While in Milan he studied Latin and made Italian translations of Ovid's <span class="italic">Remedia amoris</span> and <span class="italic">Amores</span>, which he published more than ten years later, in 1752 and 1754. The war of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, and after returning briefly to Turin in 1742 Baretti obtained employment in Cuneo, as keeper of the stores for the city's new fortification works. However, a few days before the French and Spanish armies laid siege to the town in September 1744, he returned to Milan, from where he travelled again to Venice. Here he joined another literary circle, the Accademia dei Granelleschi, and translated into blank verse the tragedies of Pierre Corneille; these translations were published in four volumes in 1747&#150;8. It was in Venice that his polemical nature first gained notice when, following criticism made by a quarrelsome priest, Dr Biagio Schiavo, of a sonnet that Baretti had written previously, he published in response a <span class="italic">Lettera ad un suo amico</span>, in which he ridiculed Schiavo's character, literary ability, and physical appearance. On his return to Turin, Baretti found another pretext to be controversial, this time reaching a much wider audience. His dislike of both the relatively new science of archaeology and of Giuseppe Bartoli, the professor of literature who had succeeded Tagliazucchi at the University of Turin, led him to denounce Bartoli's study of an antique diptych owned by Cardinal Quirini. In 1750 Baretti published what he entitled his &#145;First prattle&#146;, <span class="italic">Primo cicalamento sopra le cinque lettere del signor Giuseppe Bartoli intorno al libro che avr&agrave; per titolo &#145;La vera spiegazione del dittico quiriniano&#146;</span>, in which he mocked Bartoli and attacked archaeologists and antiquaries in general. Enraged archaeologists publicly denounced Baretti for criticizing a university professor who had been appointed by the king. Baretti was summoned before the president of the senate and the chancellor of the University of Turin, reprimanded, and ordered not to write any more <i>cicalamenti</i>. In the same year he published a collection of his poems, <span class="italic">Le piacevoli poesie</span>, which were burlesque and satirical in style in the manner of the sixteenth-century poet Francesco Berni. These poems, compiled over several years up to 1750, also included attacks on Bartoli, whose lack of literary ability he criticized, but Baretti avoided the wrath of the censors by tempering his language and not referring to Bartoli directly.<h2>
<a name="FirstperiodinEngland"></a>First period in England</h2>As early as 1747 in Turin, when he met Lord Charlemont during the latter's tour on the continent, Baretti had thought of travelling to England. No doubt the difficulty of living and of writing in his homeland, which he had deeply felt during the events of 1750, induced him to leave for England in January 1751. After arriving in London, he began studying English in a far more earnest fashion than he had done previously in Italy. He met another Italian from Turin, the violinist Felice Giardini, who obtained employment for him at the Italian opera for the next two years. Baretti was struck by the size of London and its contrasts, where the bustling, dirty streets were filled on the one hand with charming and attractive women, and on the other with countless beggars and petty criminals.<br>
<br>Two years after his arrival in London, Baretti was introduced to the writer Mrs Charlotte Lennox, who was anxious to learn Italian in order to read Italian works, and was willing to offer lessons in English in return. Baretti promptly agreed to become her tutor, and was introduced to Mrs Lennox's circle of artists and literary friends, who included Henry Fielding, Sir Joshua Reynolds (who later painted Baretti's portrait), David Garrick, and&#151;most significantly for Baretti&#151;Samuel Johnson. Baretti's presence in the group was appealing because of his familiarity with literary academies in Italy, and for his knowledge of French and Italian literature. Baretti, for his part, saw the circle as providing access to some of the most cultured people in London and a direct link to possible publishers of his own writings. Indeed, that year, 1753, was a prolific year for Baretti. He published two booklets, both written in French, dealing with current disputes at the opera. He produced an essay, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Italian Language and Writers</span>, which, given that he had not yet fully mastered English, was probably first drafted in French and then turned into English with the help of one of his new friends. In addition, no doubt encouraged to write on the subject of Italian poetry by his English friends, and as a means of making some money, he published a <span class="italic">Dissertation upon the Italian Poetry</span>, which included a censure of Voltaire. The vocabulary, syntax, and writing style used in the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> clearly point to the involvement of Johnson, whom Baretti very much admired. In the years that followed, Baretti, not just because of his cultural ideals and the interest of his learned friends but also for mere pecuniary reasons, realized that one of his major roles in England was to be that of promoter of Italian language and literature, and a writer who could make contemporary Italian culture accessible to the English. In the same decade he published a bilingual collection of Italian prose and verse, entitled <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Italian Language</span> (1755), and <span class="italic">The Italian Library</span> (1757), which provided short commentaries on the lives and works of well-known Italian writers, as well as a brief history of the development of the Tuscan language.<h2>
<a name="BarettisItalianandEnglishdictionary"></a>Baretti's Italian and English dictionary</h2>Inspired by the success of Johnson's recently published English dictionary, in the latter part of the 1750s Baretti set about compiling an Italian and English bilingual dictionary for the use of both Italian- and English-speakers. He considered Johnson's dictionary an extraordinary achievement that could dispute the pre-eminence of lexicography with that of the Florentine <span class="italic">Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</span> (1612), a volume that had been compiled not by one person but by numerous academicians. He stipulated in an agreement with London booksellers that he would revise Ferdinando Altieri's previous Italian and English dictionary (1726&#150;7) for &pound;200, a considerable sum. Baretti published <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the English and Italian Languages</span> in 1760, in two volumes, with the addition of an Italian and English grammar and a dedicatory letter written by Samuel Johnson. In the preface Baretti made a virulent attack on Altieri, claiming that his predecessor's dictionary definitions awakened his &#145;risibility&#146; and were evidence of his &#145;ignorance&#146;, and that Altieri himself &#145;had not the least spark of poetical fire in his soul&#146;. One would have therefore expected Baretti to have carried out a radical revision of Altieri's previous work. The fact was, however, that the alterations and additions wrought by Baretti were, all in all, very minor. In the Italian word-list he inserted a modest selection of the additional vocabulary contained in the latest edition of the <span class="italic">Vocabolario della Crusca</span>, and on the English side he added some of the entries from Johnson's dictionary.<br>
<br>Despite representing only a minor revision, Baretti's dictionary marked the death knell for Altieri's twin volumes of three decades before. Baretti's work proved extremely successful, for its author financially as well, and may be considered the most important work he published during his first stay in England. The dictionary, as the standard reference work of its kind, went through numerous reprints and revisions, some long after his death, and the last as recently as 1928.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoItaly"></a>Return to Italy</h2>Flushed with the success of his dictionary, Baretti the same year took the opportunity to accompany to Italy a young aristocrat, Edward Southwell, whose intention it was to embark on the usual continental tour, travelling first through Portugal and Spain. Baretti planned to return to Italy definitively, in the expectation that there he would now achieve greater fame as an Italian writer than previously. Before his departure Johnson suggested he write a daily journal of his travels as the basis for a future publication, a request Johnson reiterated in his correspondence with Baretti while the latter was abroad. After visiting his brothers in Turin, Baretti travelled to Milan and then to Venice, where he parted from his companion Southwell, having completed his contract as his tour guide. On returning to Milan, he was introduced to the new governor, Count Firmian, who was a patron of the arts and letters, in the hope that the governor might provide him with patronage. He renewed his contacts with those who frequented the Accademia dei Trasformati, and made the acquaintance of the poet Giuseppe Parini.<br>
<br>In 1762 Baretti published the first of what were to be four volumes that recounted his recent journey to the continent, giving it the title <span class="italic">Lettere familiari ai suoi tre fratelli</span>. But following a complaint lodged with Count Firmian by the Portuguese minister in Milan, who believed that Baretti had unjustly criticized the hospitality of the Portuguese, Firmian ordered him to halt further publication. Baretti, having lost the opportunity both to obtain patronage and to publish his travel journal, moved to Venice, thinking that he might be able to complete the publication there. But the Venetian government was just as unsympathetic, and allowed him to publish the second volume in 1763 only after he had deleted any suggestion of criticism of Portugal. Although the two Italian volumes remained incomplete, they reflected Baretti's new-found maturity as a writer who demonstrated, somewhat like a modern journalist, that he was an acute observer of everyday life, able to provide vivid descriptions of the places that he had visited and the people whom he had met.<br>
<br>Baretti's despondency at the difficulties that he had encountered in Italy (which was evidently heightened by an ill-fated love affair about which Johnson wrote a letter of consolation in December 1762) was alleviated by his contacts with the renowned writers Carlo and Gasparo Gozzi, whose company he assiduously frequented while in Venice. That year, in Padua, Baretti submitted to the censors a request to publish a fortnightly journal <span class="italic">La Frusta Letteraria</span> (&#145;The Literary Scourge&#146;) which aimed, like Addison's <span class="italic">Spectator</span> and Johnson's <span class="italic">Rambler</span>, to evaluate contemporary customs and literature, to review books, and to condemn, as necessary, examples of bad taste. The first issue appeared in October 1763. In subsequent issues Baretti attacked archaeologists, the Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni, the Arcadians, Voltaire, Pietro Verri and the Milanese journal <span class="italic">Il Caff&egrave;</span>, and blank verse. The journal, as an independent and iconoclastic publication, did not bow to any public authority, and did not hesitate to be critical of the art and culture of its time or to censure otherwise untouchable writers who had achieved fame and respect. For this reason <span class="italic">La Frusta Letteraria</span> became the work for which Italians today most remember Baretti. His continued attack on writers, including the revered sixteenth-century Venetian Pietro Bembo, resulted in the journal's being suppressed by the Venetian authorities in 1765. Baretti fled Venice, and, after several months spent near Ancona, where he published his last issues of the journal (April&#150;July 1765), he decided that he could no longer continue to write and publish in Italy.<h2>
<a name="SecondperiodinEngland"></a>Second period in England</h2>Baretti left Italy for England in August 1766 having made the decision to reside there permanently. In the literary environment of London, which he found much more congenial than the one he had just left, he renewed his acquaintance with his old friends, especially Samuel Johnson, who had kept up a correspondence with him during his absence in Italy. The circle had by now become the renowned Literary Club, where Baretti was introduced to Oliver Goldsmith, James Boswell, and Edmund Burke. Baretti's first publication in London was <span class="italic">An Account of the Manners and Customs of Italy</span> (1768), written as a reply to the inaccurate and superficial description of Italian customs and manners given in <span class="italic">Letters from Italy</span> by Samuel Sharp, published two years earlier. Unlike the negative view of Italy that he had portrayed in <span class="italic">La Frusta</span>, Baretti's <span class="italic">Account</span> provided a more favourable picture of Italian life and culture that appealed to his Italophile British friends. The book was so popular that a second edition followed in 1769, containing an answer to Sharp's criticism of the first edition. Baretti had now established his reputation as an English writer, so much so that in 1769 the king appointed him secretary for foreign correspondence to the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In 1768 Baretti visited France and Spain to collect more material for what would be the English edition of his <span class="italic">Lettere familiari</span>, which he had not been able to complete in Italy.<br>
<br>In October 1769, while walking at the Haymarket, Baretti was struck a blow by a prostitute. Owing to the darkness and his bad eyesight he retaliated by striking her female companion. Three pimps appeared on the scene, and Baretti drew a fruit-knife that he carried and fatally wounded one of them. He was arrested and subsequently brought to trial for murder at the Old Bailey. His friends Topham Beauclerk, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr Johnson, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith, and others&#151;&#145;a constellation of genius&#146;, in Boswell's account&#151;rallied to support him and testified at the trial to his good character  (Boswell, 419). The jury acquitted him on the grounds of self-defence. Baretti felt more than ever now that justice and his real friends resided in England. He told his old friend Lord Charlemont that &#145;those I had about me did their part so well that they have made me an Englishman forever&#146;  (Collinson-Morley, 222).<br>
<br>In the following year Baretti published the definitive edition of his <span class="italic">Lettere familiari</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Journey from London to Genoa</span> (1770). The work, enlarged and now in English, achieved instant success: Johnson called it one of the best travel books ever written. Baretti was now at the height of his success. He decided to pay a visit to Italy to see his brothers and to enjoy the pleasure of appearing as a famous writer, but within a year, after visiting Turin, Genoa, and Florence, he returned to England to what he now called his &#145;nest&#146;, unhappy with the country of his birth, which he referred to as dull, and whose people he felt were ignorant. This was his last trip to Italy. In London he returned to writing, publishing in 1772 <span class="italic">An Introduction to the most Useful European Languages</span> and in 1773, in three volumes, <span class="italic">Tutte le opere di Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</span>. His popular dictionary was reprinted in 1771.<br>
<br>Between 1773 and 1776 Baretti became the language tutor to Hetty (Queeney), the daughter of Henry Thrale, brewery proprietor, and his wife, Hester Thrale, to whom he was introduced by Johnson. During these three years Baretti chose to live on and off at their villa at Streatham, where the Thrales were accustomed to entertaining artists, writers, and distinguished professional people. In 1775 they arranged for Baretti and Johnson to travel with them for two months to France. Mr Thrale was so pleased with the French tour that they planned another trip, this time to Italy the following year, but were prevented from leaving owing to the death of their only son, Harry. In 1775 Baretti wrote and published a collection of dialogues, <span class="italic">Easy Phraseology for the Use of Young Ladies</span>, which had been originally intended for his pupil Hetty. The relationship between Baretti and Mrs Thrale, however, became so tense in 1776 that Baretti abruptly left the house and returned to London.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Baretti's most important work of this period was the defence of Shakespeare that he published in 1777 in response to a letter written to the French Academy the year before by Voltaire, in which Voltaire denounced his countryman Pierre Letourneur for translating and publishing Shakespeare's plays. Baretti's <span class="italic">Discours sur Shakespeare et sur Monsieur de Voltaire</span> attacked Voltaire for his lack of appreciation of Shakespeare's artistic merit, and for his limited knowledge of the English language and therefore of Shakespeare's plays. Baretti's decision to write the work in French (a language Johnson felt that Baretti knew as fluently as English) meant that it was accessible to readers on the continent, including Italy, where the classical tradition held sway and Shakespeare's plays were still very little known. That year was also spent preparing a two-volume Spanish and English dictionary, which was published in London by Nourse in 1778. Baretti labelled it a second edition, since it was essentially a minor revision of the dictionary of Giral Delpino published in 1763. As was the case with his earlier Italian and English dictionary, the revision of the Spanish dictionary was mainly editorial&#151;the expurgation of previous inconsistencies and inaccuracies&#151;with additional vocabulary inserted primarily on the English side, where Baretti included words from Johnson's dictionary. The Spanish dictionary, too, was well received and was republished with revisions well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1779 Baretti's output continued at the same pace. That year Nourse invited him to compile an anthology of Italian letters as a language text for students of Italian. Not satisfied with those written by earlier Italian writers, Baretti chose instead to resort to letters that he himself had previously sent, or pretended to have sent, to friends and acquaintances. The resulting <span class="italic">Scelta di lettere familiari fatta per uso degli studiosi di lingua italiana</span> provided students with a useful variety of topics, vocabulary, and writing styles, as well as a showcase for English readers of his opinions on Italian language, literature, and society, and of his own ability as a writer of Italian prose. Looking for another opportunity to earn some money, in the same year Baretti translated Horace's <span class="italic">Carmen seculare</span> for the French musician Philidor, who set it to music and performed it with some success at the Freemasons' Hall, but then disappeared with part of the takings. Baretti had few financial resources until 1782, when he managed to obtain a government pension of &pound;80 annually, which, coupled with the income from his published writings, would thereafter provide him with just enough money to support himself.<br>
<br>Three years after her husband's death in 1781, Mrs Thrale created a scandal by marrying the singer Gabriele Mario Piozzi, who was her daughters' music teacher. Baretti's animosity towards Mrs Thrale reached its peak after Johnson's death, when she published two volumes of letters to and from Johnson, among which were passages that were offensive to Baretti. Enraged, Baretti decided to vent his anger in print, attacking Mrs Thrale in three &#145;Strictures&#146; in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> between May and August 1788, in which he made unsubstantiated allegations about her tyrannical behaviour and about Piozzi's background. Baretti's decision to vent his feelings in print only worsened the reputation that he had acquired in later life as combative and ill-natured. In 1789, pressed for money and with his pension three-quarters in arrears, he began revising his Italian dictionary in the hope of gaining some income, but he was taken ill with an attack of &#145;gout&#146; (a contemporary term that could cover a range of maladies), and died, unmarried, in London on 5 May. He was buried in Marylebone on 9 May in a cemetery that was later cleared, so that today the site of his grave cannot be traced. His executors destroyed all the papers and manuscripts in his possession.<h2>
<a name="BarettiandJohnson"></a>Baretti and Johnson</h2>Baretti claimed that Johnson was the best friend he ever had and the person to whom he was indebted for the best part of the knowledge that he had acquired. For his part, Johnson, who never managed to visit Italy, admired Baretti for his linguistic and conversational skills&#151;praising his English, for example, for &#145;its purity and vigour&#146;&#151;his scholarship, and his knowledge of Italian culture  (Boswell, 256). At the same time he was sensitive to Baretti's limitations, noting in 1768 that &#145;There are strong powers in his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has, he grapples very forcibly&#146;  (ibid., 395). Both writers had an overbearing and stubborn temperament; but each greatly respected the other. They enjoyed each other's company for nearly thirty years until, a year before Johnson's death, they quarrelled&#151;not over a profound philosophical issue but about the outcome of a game of chess. Boswell's view of Baretti, however, captured some of the less attractive qualities of the Italian: in 1766 he described him as &#145;so wretchedly perverted to infidelity, that he treated the hopes of immortality with brutal levity&#146;  (ibid., 357).<br>
<br>Johnson's influence on Baretti's writings is indisputable. Johnson's presence can be found in many of Baretti's works, either explicitly, in the dedications and prefaces that he wrote for the Italian's publications, or implicitly, in the input of Johnson's ideas on language and literature, and in the kinds of works that Baretti chose to publish. To say, however, as Foscolo did, that Baretti simply aped Johnson, or to conclude, with a more recent scholar, that Baretti totally lacked originality  (C. J. M. Lubbers-Van der Brugge, 1&#150;3), does not do him justice. Rather, Baretti's long-term contact with Johnson confirms how much they had in common in terms of both temperament and literary tastes. The relationship assisted Baretti to mature intellectually, broadened his outlook on art and literature, introduced him to English writing and culture, and allowed him to make a living and achieve fame as an author, without having to resort to a Maecenas or patron; Johnson, similarly freed from the need for literary patronage, noted that Baretti had been the first author to receive &#145;copy-money&#146; in Italy for his works  (Boswell, 846). In England his publications helped to promote a renewed interest in Italian language and literature, including the works of Dante. In Italy his works encouraged the study of writings by English authors, especially Shakespeare. Of the eighteenth-century critics he is the Italian best remembered in the English-speaking world.<br>
