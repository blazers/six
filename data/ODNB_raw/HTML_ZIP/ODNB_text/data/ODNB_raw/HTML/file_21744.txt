<span class="headword">Peckham,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1526, <em>d.</em> 1556), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born by 1526, having been old enough to marry in 1547; he was the second of four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21742/', "Sir Edmund Peckham (d. 1564)")</script>, administrator, of Denham, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1570), daughter of John Cheyne of Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire. Sir Edmund Peckham was a leading administrator in the exchequer and the royal household, and treasurer of the mint from 1544 to 1564. Henry Peckham's younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21743/', "Sir George Peckham")</script>. Peckham's early life is poorly documented, but he probably received some education, like his elder brother, Sir Robert Peckham (<i>d</i>. 1569), who attended Gray's Inn in the 1530s. Peckham was described in 1550 as &#145;the king's servant&#146;. He married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1530&#150;1602), daughter of Robert Dacres of London and Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and niece of Sir Anthony Denny and Sir John Gates, by a licence dated 6 November 1547. She and her uncles may have converted Peckham to protestantism. Apparently he lived at Denham or at his father's house at Blackfriars, London, though he acquired lands in Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, and Sussex. Peckham was elected MP to Edward VI's last parliament in March 1553, sitting for the borough of Chipping Wycombe, Berkshire, perhaps with help from his father or from John Dudley, duke of Northumberland. He opposed Northumberland's attempt to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne in July 1553.<br>
<br>Peckham's career under Mary I is curious. His Catholic father and brother Robert became privy councillors, and both represented Buckinghamshire in parliament, Edmund in October 1553 and November 1554, Robert in April 1554. The protestant Henry was re-elected from Chipping Wycombe to the parliaments of October 1553, April 1554, and 1555. He supported &#145;true religion&#146; against the restoration of Catholicism in Mary's first parliament. Yet, serving under his father during Wyatt's rebellion in February 1554, he defended Ludgate against the rebel advance on London, and Mary rewarded him with the manors of Wishanger, Gloucestershire, in 1554, and Tring, Hertfordshire, in 1555. However, he complained that she had &#145;given him but one hundred marks a yere and taken away four&#146;  (Loades, <span class="italic">Two Tudor Conspiracies</span>, 213). During the parliament of 1555 he was part of the opposition group, led by Sir Anthony Kingston, which met at Arundel's tavern in November&#150;December and formulated a conspiracy against the crown.<br>
<br>Henry Dudley and his supporters were hostile to Mary's husband, Philip of Spain, her persecution of protestants, and the possible restoration of former ecclesiastical lands to the church. They sought backing from Henri II of France for a rising in southern England to oust Mary in favour of her sister, Princess Elizabeth, and they plotted to steal &pound;50,000 in silver bullion from the exchequer to finance it. The conspirators met several times in Peckham's rooms at Blackfriars and considered storing stolen bullion there. Peckham involved his relatives Edmund and Francis Verney and John Bray, second Baron Bray, and boasted that he could raise a host in Buckinghamshire. He also persuaded Edward Lewkenor to obtain a copy of Henry VIII's will to prove that Mary was a usurper. However, Peckham was among the first group arrested and sent to the Tower of London on 18 March 1556. Indicted on 29 April, he was tried with John Danyell in the Guildhall on 7 May. According to the Venetian ambassador, Giovanni Michieli, it seemed at first that Peckham might be reprieved because of his father's influence and his own past service. His brother claimed that Henry had joined the conspirators only as a spy, and certainly his confessions of 9 May led to accusations that he had betrayed his fellow prisoners. However, Mary insisted that Peckham and Danyell suffer the full penalty of hanging, drawing, and quartering &#145;by reason of the small fruit derived from her past indulgence&#146;  (Loades, <span class="italic">Mary Tudor</span>, 336). Michieli claimed that they made &#145;a Godly and Catholic end&#146;. Perhaps because there were demonstrations in favour of executed conspirators, Peckham and Danyell were the last to die, on 7 or 8 July. The value of the property Peckham forfeited as a traitor is unknown. Mary allowed his widow to keep Tring for life; subsequently she married John Blount of London.<br>
