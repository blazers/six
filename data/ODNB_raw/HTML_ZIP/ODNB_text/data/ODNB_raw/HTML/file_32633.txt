<span class="headword">Croft,  Henry Page</span>, first Baron Croft  (1881&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Fanhams Hall, Ware, Hertfordshire, on 22 June 1881. He was the second son and youngest of the eight children of Richard Benyon Croft (1843&#150;1912), an officer in the Royal Navy from 1858 to 1873, who later joined the business of Henry Page (1843&#150;1912), a prosperous Hertford grain trader and maltster, after marrying Page's only child and heir, Anne Elizabeth (1843&#150;1921), Henry Page Croft's mother. On his father's side, he was descended from the Croft family of Croft Castle, baronets. Raised in relative luxury, he attended St David's School, Reigate, Eton College, and Shrewsbury School, where he showed plenty of prowess in rowing but more modest academic ability. With his father's encouragement he went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to study chemistry. He captained the boat club, but left to join the family business in 1902 without taking a degree, his elder brother, Richard Page Croft (1872&#150;1961) having been severely wounded in the South African War. Quickly mastering the demands of both the corn trade and the brewing industry, he also gained valuable political insights into many of the problems then facing British commerce. On 10 July 1907 he married Nancy Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Sir Robert Hudson Borwick (later first Baron Borwick), a businessman, and had three daughters and a son.<h2>
<a name="Theempireandtariffreform"></a>The empire and tariff reform</h2>Like so many other young Conservatives of his generation, Croft was drawn into the world of politics by Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform campaign. His memoirs liken his frequent trips to Highbury to a &#145;pilgrim going to Mecca&#146;  (Croft, <span class="italic">Life of Strife</span>, 46&#150;7); and the combination of Joe's organizational crusading zeal and intense imperial patriotism was to leave an indelible imprint on him. Thereafter, enthusiasm for empire (in particular for its self-governing regions), a fear of at first the dominions and then later India spinning out of the imperial orbit, and a deeply rooted belief in the capacity of the colonies to contribute to Britain's economic and spiritual well-being, were consistently at the centre of his political outlook.<br>
<br>But Croft's imperialism was of the constructive variety: for idle imperialists he had no time at all. Like a thriving business, the empire needed close attention, careful management, and an eye constantly on the future. The passivity of the state, or of its political leaders, was thus to be condemned. What was required was creative and dynamic government, with administrative and legislative programmes aimed at furthering &#145;imperial unity&#146;. Bringing the self-governing dominions into closer contact with Britain was the major theme of his <span class="italic">The Path of Empire</span> (1912), which had an introduction by Joseph Chamberlain. This, in turn, demanded attention to the form as well as the substance of political life, and it was here that Croft was to excel. His organizational and campaigning skills were harnessed to a variety of pre-war right-wing political movements&#151;the Tariff Reform League (TRL), the Confederacy, Reveille, and the Imperial Union&#151;all of which saw the Chamberlainite policy of preferential tariffs as crucial to the ability of Britain and the empire to survive in an increasingly competitive and hostile international environment. Possibly for the first time in British politics, here was a cause which could so inspire a group of men (and women) that they would make party serve the interests of empire, not the other way round. Whether within or beyond the pale of the Unionist Party, Croft showed throughout his life a facility for experimenting with new types of political organization which made for a turbulent and tortuous but not entirely unrewarding parliamentary career.<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Croft's contribution to the tariff reform campaign was immense. He began by traversing east Hertfordshire&#151;in a dog cart with a stout cob belonging to his father&#151;to set up local branches of the TRL. Within months fifteen branches were established with a combined membership of 2036. These branches remained among the most active within the league a decade later. In 1906 he contested the parliamentary constituency of Lincoln, whose sitting member, Charles Seely, was a strong Unionist free trader. Croft came bottom of the poll, but Seely was also defeated, the split Conservative vote letting a Liberal in. Defending his stand Croft stated, &#145;I much prefer an open enemy as a member for Lincoln than a professing friend who will stab me in the back&#146;  (Witherell, 43). This intransigent attitude thrust Croft to the centre of the Confederacy, a secret society of fifty or so youthful and ardent tariff reformers who from 1907 to 1909 pressed the party leader, Arthur Balfour, to commit himself to their cause, while trying to purge or purify the parliamentary party of free trade MPs and candidates. In 1910 Croft was elected by a narrow majority to the Christchurch division of Hampshire (having campaigned there vigorously for the previous three years). He remained in the House of Commons for thirty years, retaining the Bournemouth half of his constituency when it was divided in 1918.<br>
<br>The successors to the Confederacy were the Reveille movement and the Imperial Union. The former was founded by Croft in the summer of 1910 out of frustration with &#145;the sleeping sickness&#146; to which he felt the Unionist Party had succumbed. Its aim was to shift party policy from a negative defence of the <i>status quo</i> to a positive programme of national defence, tariff reform and imperial union, small ownership, and poor law reform. In effect, this amounted to a frontal attack on Balfour as party leader. Indeed, Balfour's tactical pledge in December 1910 not to impose food duties until submitting them to the verdict of a referendum had so incensed Croft and his co-organizer, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that, like Leo Maxse, they were convinced that he &#145;must go&#146;. The Imperial Mission, an empire-wide movement active from 1911 to 1913, which Croft chaired, was particularly concerned with the danger of a trade reciprocity agreement between Canada and the USA (Croft visited Canada to support Robert Borden's campaign against such an agreement), but also organized rallies in England, especially in the north. In 1912 Croft became vice-chairman of the Tariff Reform League's organizing committee (he became its chairman in 1916), and in 1913 he succeeded George Wyndham as head of the league's Lancashire, Cheshire, and north-west counties federation, and was one of the few Unionist MPs to refuse to put his name to the memorial stating full confidence in Bonar Law's tariff policy. Croft believed that the tariff reform campaign would best be advanced by grass roots political activism, and that constituency work was vital in proving that preference was potentially a popular cause.<h2>
<a name="TheNationalParty"></a>The National Party</h2>In November 1914 Croft went to France with the 1st volunteer battalion of the Hertfordshire regiment, which he had joined as an undergraduate, and which he was to command within a year. He had previously written on national defence, arguing for the necessity of a &#145;national citizen army&#146; as an integral part of military policy  (H. P. Croft, &#145;A citizen army&#146;, in Lord Malmesbury, ed., <span class="italic">The New Order: Studies in Unionist Policy</span>, 1908, pp. 255&#150;68). He fought on the Somme in 1916 as commander of the 68th infantry brigade and was twice mentioned in dispatches. After spending twenty-two months at the front&#151;longer than any other MP&#151;he returned to Britain to take up his seat in the House of Commons. His wartime experience hardened the political opinions which he had formed over the previous decade. Having witnessed the selflessness and bravery of men at the front he became more intolerant of the pragmatism and opportunism of politicians at home. Having felt at first hand the spirit of patriotism in the trenches, he was outraged at the pettiness and sordidness of the party system, not least at Lloyd George's sale of honours for party funds. Having watched the damage inflicted by German U-boats on Britain's food supplies, he was more than ever convinced of the need for an economic policy which would secure the greatest possible production of all the necessities of life under the British flag. And having seen the soldiers of Britain's dominions spill their blood on the battlefields of France he insisted that this be recognized by increasing the involvement of their political leaders in the management of the empire's affairs.<br>
<br>Determined that Britain should learn the lessons of the war, Croft resigned from the Tariff Reform League (along with its chairman, Viscount Duncannon) in August 1917 to form a new National Party, in order to oppose the &#145;corrupt compromises&#146; of the coalition, and to strive for the principles of &#145;National Production and Imperial Unity&#146;. In addition to tariffs, the National Party advocated neo-corporatist ideas (for example trade associations and a &#145;standard comfort wage&#146;) to deal with unemployment and poverty; a strict peace treaty with Germany; stiff restrictions on alien immigration; and publication of the details of party funds. It briefly claimed seven MPs and eighteen peers, as well as press support from the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, and its own monthly journal, <span class="italic">National Opinion</span> (published from October 1917 to November 1922). Twenty-five candidates were fielded at the 1918 election, but only two (Croft and Sir Richard Ashmole Cooper) were returned. None the less, the National Party received just over 94,000 votes&#151;one of the highest polls (in percentage terms) achieved by any minor party in the twentieth century. In January 1921 it was decided not to contest any more seats, and shortly afterwards the National Party was absorbed into the ranks of the Conservative &#145;die-hards&#146; who, while divided over domestic policy, were united against the coalition's policy of buying off Irish, Indian, and Egyptian nationalists with constitutional concessions. Following the fall of Lloyd George, the die-hards lost momentum and Croft returned to the Conservative fold (his Bournemouth constituency association had remained loyal to him throughout this period). He was created a baronet in February 1924.<h2>
<a name="TariffsandIndiabetweenthewars"></a>Tariffs and India between the wars</h2>As chairman of the influential Empire Industries Association (EIA), Croft took a leading part in the revived agitation for tariffs from 1927 to 1931. Like the TRL, the EIA's propaganda emphasized the importance of developing the resources of Britain's colonies and expanding trade within the empire&#151;&#145;Empire Trade saves Great Britain&#146;, as he was apt to declare  (H. P. Croft, <span class="italic">The Crisis: How to Restore Prosperity</span>, 1931, 1). But it also made even greater play of the need to safeguard home industries and to prevent the domestic market from being &#145;exploited&#146; by foreign producers. Its campaigning on this issue was unremitting, and often took the form of protests on behalf of specific industries: iron and steel, lace and embroidery, motor vehicles, for example. Under his guidance the EIA quickly became a force to be reckoned with. Little attempt was made to enlist the support of the trade unions, his attitude to organized labour having hardened since the war. The EIA was also more accommodating towards the Conservative Party leadership: its message was disseminated by the press and platform, but it decided to work locally through existing party organizations rather than to form rival EIA branches. The EIA likewise avoided a confrontation with the Conservative leadership on the issue of food duties and preference, despite its frustrations with the limitations imposed by Baldwin's election pledge. Croft's own contribution to this campaign was huge, and it was partly owing to him that pro-tariff resolutions were secured at Conservative Party conferences in Scarborough (1926), Cardiff (1927), and Yarmouth (1928). By late 1928 an EIA memorial on the steel industry attracted the signatures of 200 MPs. Of course, the Ottawa tariff agreements (1932)&#151;a series of bilateral agreements between Britain and the dominions establishing a system of imperial preference&#151;were ultimately a response to world depression. But the vigorous lobbying and propaganda activity of the EIA had helped to promote the idea that a solution to Britain's economic problems lay in the empire. Croft, who was a key figure in this process, later reflected that the decisions of the Ottawa conference had placed a seal on the great policy which Joseph Chamberlain had given to the empire, and completed the main objective of his own political life.<br>
<br>In the early to mid-1930s Croft joined Churchill in the fight against Indian constitutional reform&#151;what was the use of campaigning for thirty years to promote imperial unity, he asked, only to stand by and watch the end of British rule in India? To Croft, the policy of granting India greater self-government was a total anathema, a betrayal of the providential mission bestowed by God on the British nation in the form of its empire. His faith in Britain's right and duty to govern India was unshakeable:<blockquote>our ideal of government is the nearest approach to Christianity, and to exchange it for government which may lean towards the precepts of the Hindu religion and the ideals of the worship of Shiva or Kali is quite definitely, in my view, a &#145;spiritual abdication&#146;. (Studdert-Kennedy, 349)</blockquote>He also firmly believed that India's problems were economic, not political, and that the reforms would &#145;sharpen not soften communal strife&#146;  (Croft, <span class="italic">Life of Strife</span>, 237). These convictions brought him into conflict yet again with the Conservative leadership. Before its annual conference in Birmingham in 1933 he circulated a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Salvation of India</span> to every delegate of every constituency body, an infringement of an unwritten rule that MPs must not attempt to interfere with constituency affairs. He was typically unapologetic, stating that he would &#145;never hesitate personally to address any communications to Conservatives at any time when I consider that there is a danger to British or Imperial interests&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of a Conservative: J. C. C. Davidson's Memoirs and Papers, 1910&#150;37</span>, ed. R. R. James, 1969, 396).<br>
<br>Even with Churchill's emergence as their leader, however, the die-hards of the 1930s fared little better than their predecessors a decade before. The more liberal direction of Baldwin's and Hoare's India policy was not to be changed, and the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> was passed in 1935, Croft having spoken against it in parliament nearly 300 times. He never wavered in his belief that the British empire was &#145;the greatest instrument for the advancement of Christian ideals in the world&#146;  (Studdert-Kennedy, 350). From 1936 to 1939 he continued to agitate on imperial affairs, along with Amery, George Lloyd, Alan Lennox Boyd, and Austen Chamberlain. A mass meeting was staged at the Albert Hall in July 1936 to mark the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain's birth, and to launch a new national campaign for empire unity.<h2>
<a name="WarOfficeandpeerage"></a>War Office and peerage</h2>Though Croft found himself temporarily estranged from Churchill and his friends when he supported the Munich agreement in 1938, his contribution to the India Defence League, and his earlier co-operation with the anti-appeasement rebels, were not forgotten, and after Churchill became prime minister, Croft was elevated to the peerage as Baron Croft of Bournemouth in May 1940, and was made joint parliamentary under-secretary for war (with Edward Grigg), answering for the War Office in the House of Lords. His earlier advocacy of a citizen army made him &#145;a true believer&#146; in the Home Guard, formed in May 1940 in response to the German invasion threat. He attracted ridicule, though, for his defence in the House of Lords (4 February 1942) of distributing pikes to the Home Guard in the absence of sufficient firearms; these became known as &#145;Croft's pikes&#146;  (Mackenzie, 179, 100). He retained his post in Churchill's short-lived caretaker government of 1945. He died at the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 7 December 1947.<br>
<br>Croft was described as a &#145;tower of strength&#146;, &#145;indefatigable worker&#146; and &#145;stalwart fighter&#146; by Leo Amery, who lamented that Croft had never received the recognition that he deserved  (Amery, vol. 3). His boundless energy, organizational flair, and passionate commitment to the empire helped to sustain a succession of right-wing movements; these encountered mixed fortunes but are integral to the history of twentieth-century Conservatism. This left little time for recreation or even, perhaps, for his family; his son-in-law, Manfred Uhlman, described Croft's attitude toward his children as &#145;correct, cool and reserved&#146;  (Uhlman, 208). Not surprisingly, Uhlman, a socialist and Jewish refugee from Germany, who married Croft's second daughter, Diana (1912&#150;1999) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/73593">Uhlman,  (Nancy) Diana Joyce</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/60810">Uhlman,  Manfred</a>], was not welcomed into the family. Croft apparently considered the union tantamount to &#145;social suicide&#146;, though, to his credit, he subsequently visited the couple and their children. Croft was succeeded as second baron by his son, Michael Henry Glendower Page Croft (1916&#150;1997).<br>
