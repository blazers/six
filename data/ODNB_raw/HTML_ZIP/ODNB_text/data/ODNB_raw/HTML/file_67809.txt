<span class="headword">Nairn, Sir  Michael Barker</span>, first baronet  (1838&#150;1915), <span class="occ">floorcloth and linoleum manufacturer</span>, was born on 29 May 1838, probably in Kirkcaldy, the second son in the family of six sons and two daughters of Michael Nairn and his wife, Catharine (<i>c</i>.1815&#150;<i>c</i>.1891), daughter of Alexander Ingram of Kirkcaldy, Fife, owner of a bleaching yard.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67807"></a><span class="headword">Michael Nairn</span>  (1804&#150;1858), <span class="occ">floorcloth manufacturer</span>, was born on 4 April 1804, probably in Kirkcaldy, the son of James Nairn and his wife, Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barker. He returned to Kirkcaldy after serving an apprenticeship to a weaver in Dundee. He set up in business at Coal Wynd, Kirkcaldy, in 1828, weaving sailmakers' canvas, and was soon exporting canvas all over the world. By the early 1840s he was supplying canvas backing material to many English floorcloth manufacturers, and in 1848 he opened his own floorcloth factory, the Scottish Floorcloth Manufactory. In the 1850s Nairn introduced a new method of printing designs on floorcloth, moving one reviewer of the floorcloth exhibits at the 1861 International Exhibition to write that floorcloth could now be produced with &#145;all the richness, the minuteness, and the finish of a velvet-pile carpet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1 Dec 1862). He died suddenly on 18 January 1858, leaving his widow as sole owner of the business, and she created the new firm of Michael Nairn &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Michael Barker Nairn was educated at the burgh school, Kirkcaldy, and apprenticed to a lawyer and writer to the signet in 1855, but on his father's death he joined the business, entering the partnership in 1861. In 1866 he married Emily Frances (<i>d</i>. 1939), daughter of Alfred Rimington Spencer of Weybridge, Surrey. They had three sons and eight daughters: two of these children died in childhood. He quickly became the dominant force in the business, overshadowing his elder brother, Robert. A great innovator, he was responsible for the rapid expansion in the 1860s. With the help of John Wright, a Glasgow engineer, he speeded up the drying process for the floorcloth by installing steam power, and in 1869 he opened St Mary's canvas factory, installing power looms. He commissioned the interior decorator and author of <span class="italic">The Grammar of Ornament</span> (1856), Owen Jones, to design an exhibit for the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1867, where Nairns' floorcloths were regarded as the most magnificent work of the kind ever produced. By then Nairns was supplying floorcloth to most of the royal families of Europe. The firm manufactured other goods, including waterproofed carriage roofing, staircloths, and bath mats, and in 1868 began to make table baize. A London warehouse was opened in 1873, followed by warehouses in Paris, Manchester, and Glasgow.<br>
<br>When Frederick Walton's patents for linoleum expired in 1877, Nairn built a new linoleum manufacturing factory in Kirkcaldy, the first in Scotland, and made several improvements. From 1881 Nairns was able to make seamless linoleum 4 yards wide, and in 1895 began to manufacture inlaid linoleum. World sales grew: &#145;I have seen our floorcloth and linoleum beyond the first cataract of the Nile &hellip; and in the mosques of Constantinople&#146;, Nairn recorded  (Muir, 96). To avoid high import tariffs, Nairn began to manufacture linoleum abroad, opening an American subsidiary at Kearny, New Jersey, in 1888, and factories in Choisy-le-Roi, near Paris, and Bietigheim, near Stuttgart, in the 1890s. The directors of these subsidiaries always included Nairn or members of his family, and Scots from the Kirkcaldy firm. In 1893 the business became a limited liability company with Michael Barker Nairn as chairman and joint managing director; he retired as managing director in 1909, but remained chairman until his death.<br>
<br>Nairn left the Liberal Party over home rule, standing unsuccessfully as Unionist candidate for Kirkcaldy in the 1900 parliamentary election. He was created a baronet in 1904. A great benefactor of the town of Kirkcaldy, he built its hospital in 1890, financed the building of the new high school in 1894, and donated the sites for the YMCA building, opened in 1895, and for the Queen's Nurses' Home in 1897. He was a member of Kirkcaldy Free Church, and contributed to the cost of building St Brycedale Free Church, completed in 1881; he was an elder of the church from 1881 to 1910. He died on 24 November 1915 in Kirkcaldy, leaving Michael Nairn &amp; Co. the largest linoleum and floorcloth manufacturing concern in Scotland. He was buried at Monimail churchyard on 27 November.<br>
<br>His eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_67809"></a><span class="headword">Sir Michael Nairn</span>, second baronet  (1874&#150;1952)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 19 February 1874 in Kirkcaldy. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Sherborne School, and Marburg University before joining the firm in 1895. He became a director in 1899, and married Mildred Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of George Watson Neish, in 1901. They had one son and four daughters. He became managing director of the company in 1909.<br>
<br>In 1922 Nairns took over Walton's firm in Greenwich, forming a holding company, Michael Nairn and Greenwich Ltd, to manufacture inlaid linoleum. Nairn became chairman of this company in 1924, and on the death of his uncle, John Nairn, in 1928, became chairman of Michael Nairn &amp; Co. Ltd Kirkcaldy. Foreign production continued to grow with the formation of Michael Nairn &amp; Co. (Australia) in 1927, and the first congoleum factory in Britain opened in Kirkcaldy in 1927. During the 1930s the warehouses were expanded, and new ones opened in Birmingham and Bristol. During the Second World War the Nairn factories made war materials, including clothing impervious to mustard gas for the armed forces, and fuel tanks for Halifax bombers.<br>
<br>Like his father, Nairn was a benefactor, giving the grounds of Dysart House, including the ruins of Ravenscraig Castle, to the town of Kirkcaldy as a public park in 1929, and donating generously to Kirkcaldy General Hospital. He retired as chairman of both companies in January 1952, and died at his home, Elie House, Elie, Fife, on 24 September 1952.<br>
