<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stuckey family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1770&#150;1845), <span class="occ">bankers and merchants</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_48794"></a><span class="headword">Samuel George Stuckey</span>  (1740&#150;1812)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in April 1740 at Langport, Somerset, he was the youngest of the five children of George Stuckey (1697&#150;1774), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (1699&#150;1752), daughter of Lawrence Tuttiett of Stoke St Gregory, Somerset. Stuckey had an elder brother and three sisters.<br>
<br>Samuel's father, who was three times portreeve, or mayor, of Langport, was responsible for developing a flourishing mercantile firm that traded in a wide range of commodities including corn, timber, and salt. Samuel, together with his elder brother, George, greatly developed the family firm and established beyond doubt the name of Stuckey in the business and commercial life of the county of Somerset. On 20 August 1764 he married Sarah (1741&#150;1812), daughter of Robert Jennings of Cerne Abbas, Dorset. Together they had one son and five daughters.<br>
<br>About 1770, Samuel Stuckey began to provide a banking function in parallel with his trading activities; and the origin of Stuckey's Bank, which was to grow into one of the country's premier provincial banking companies, is traced to this date. The banking activities of the firm grew quickly, and agents were soon appointed in London and Bristol. In 1800 Samuel took his brother, George, into the bank, and the latter's son Vincent joined in 1801. By 1806 banking business had so increased that Samuel chose to separate the bank from the rest of the family business, and officially founded the Langport Bank in that year. By bringing in three additional partners, together with his brother George, Samuel Stuckey was able to increase the bank's capital, enabling the establishment of branches at Bridgwater and Bristol. From 1807, however, Samuel Stuckey's health was failing and he relinquished many of his direct interests in the bank. He died on 13 February 1812 at Langport and was buried there shortly after, at All Saints' Church.<br>
<br>The key figure in the subsequent development of the bank was Samuel's nephew <a name="cosubject_48795"></a><span class="headword">Vincent Stuckey</span>  (1771&#150;1845)<span class="occ"></span>. Born on 24 March 1771 at Langport, Somerset, he was the youngest of the eight children of George Stuckey (1731&#150;1807), banker and merchant, and his wife, Edith (1742&#150;1793), daughter of Thomas Beedal, of Langport, Somerset. He had four brothers and three sisters, though he was the only surviving son. His father, George, Samuel Stuckey's elder brother, was widely known in Langport and its environs, not only as a prominent member of the bank and merchant house, but as mayor of the town on no fewer than four occasions.<br>
<br>At an early age Vincent Stuckey showed himself to be of enterprising spirit when, probably about 1790, he presented himself to Lady Chatham, a neighbour and family friend, and asked if she would give him an introduction to her son the prime minister. Armed with a letter from Lady Chatham, Stuckey obtained from William Pitt (1759&#150;1806) a clerkship in the Treasury. He was soon appointed to the department of bills of exchange and owing to rapid growth in its business was in almost daily contact with Pitt himself. He was also private secretary to William Huskisson, then secretary to the Treasury. Despite such promising beginnings to a public career, Stuckey resigned from the Treasury in 1801 and returned to the family business at Langport, a decision connected with his marriage on 16 April 1801 to his first cousin Julia (1781&#150;1861), the youngest daughter of his uncle Samuel. By 1807 he was made a partner in the bank, though with the death of his father, George, and his uncle Samuel in increasingly poor health, Vincent Stuckey became <i>de facto</i> head of the firm; with Samuel's death in 1812 he became senior partner.<br>
<br>The Bank of England's monopoly of joint-stock banking meant country banks in England and Wales were limited until 1826 to private partnerships of no more than six persons, which clearly limited their capitalization and branch development. Stuckey was fortunate that in 1810 he came into a considerable fortune through a bequest from an old friend, which provided him with capital for the establishment of additional branches at Taunton and Wells, together with an agency at Illminster. In 1825 Thomas Watson Bagehot, Vincent's brother-in-law became a partner, and this further cemented links between the two patriarchal Langport families. In the following year Stuckey's nephew, the great Victorian banker, economist, and writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1029/', "Walter Bagehot")</script> was born at the Bank House, Langport, and he was later to become closely involved in the management of its affairs.<br>
<br>Following the financial crisis of 1825&#150;6, when eighty private banks failed in London and the country, the government rescinded the Bank of England's monopoly of joint-stock organization, which had stood since 1708. Stuckey was the first private banker to take advantage of the new legislation, by converting the Langport Bank to Stuckey's Banking Company in 1826. By reacting so quickly to the new opportunities, Stuckey displayed his genius as a banker. None the less, even after conversion Stuckey's Bank remained essentially a partnership, with Stuckey himself exercising the shrewd judgement and personal authority characteristic of his private banking days. The bank retained its distinctive regional focus, with further branches being confined to the Somerset and Bristol region. Such caution was perhaps best captured in his oft-quoted phrase &#145;bankers are mortal, but banks should never die&#146;  (Stuckey).<br>
<br>Stuckey was widely regarded as the leading country banker of his generation, an opinion confirmed by the quality of his testimonies to the frequent parliamentary inquiries on banking and currency questions in the early nineteenth century. Thus, despite leaving the Treasury in 1801, he remained influential in government circles and was particularly close to Sir Robert Peel: he acted as Peel's adviser and confidant during the long debates on currency reform which culminated in the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1844.<br>
<br>Though heavily involved in the management of the bank, Stuckey continued to expand the family's mercantile and shipping business, in close partnership with the Bagehots. He inherited the salt interests of his late father and uncle, including an estate with salt pans at Droitwich, Worcestershire. Much involved in the social and political life of Langport and the county, he was mayor of the town on three occasions&#151;in 1810, 1823, and 1833&#151;and served as a magistrate, churchwarden, and trustee of the local grammar school. He was also made a deputy lieutenant and, in 1822, high sheriff of Somerset. A robust and hearty figure, a memoir recalls how<blockquote>Vincent Stuckey kept a pack of hounds in Whatley, and dwelt in patriarchal style among his people&#151;hospitable, free-handed, and popular. He might be seen at times seated under the great elm on the Hill fronting the west door of the church and chatting with his neighbours. He used to tell how in his Treasury days he had shot snipe in the muddy fields between St. James's Park and Sloane Street (his home), now called Belgravia. (Ross, 355)</blockquote>Stuckey's great longing for a son was unfulfilled and indeed his family life was marred by tragedy; of ten children born to the couple only two daughters survived to adulthood. Hereditary defects intensified by the marriage of first cousins were possibly to blame. Vincent Stuckey died at Langport on 8 May 1845 and was buried there shortly afterwards in All Saints' Church. After his death, his wife, Julia, maintained a close interest in the affairs of the bank until she died, on 15 February 1861. Their considerable fortune was passed to Vincent Stuckey Wood, second son of their daughter Julia Wood, who had died in 1832. The younger Vincent took the name and arms of Stuckey in 1861 and subsequently became the third chairman of Stuckey's Banking Company between 1876 and 1900.<br>
