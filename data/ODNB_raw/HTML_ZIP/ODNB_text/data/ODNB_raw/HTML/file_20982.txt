<span class="headword">Owain,  Gutun</span> <span class="st"> [Gruffudd ap Huw ab Owain]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1451&#150;1498), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the son of Huw ab Owain, of gentry stock. His mother's name is unknown, but some sources claim that she was a sister of Si&ocirc;n ap Rhisiart, abbot of Valle Crucis. Gutun was a native of the then Welsh-speaking north Shropshire borderland, being associated with the adjoining parishes of Llandudlyst (Dudleston) and Llanfarthin (St Martin's), where he held land in the township of Ifton.<br>
<br>Gutun Owain's bardic teacher was the renowned Dafydd ab Edmwnd from the neighbouring parish of Hanmer in Maelor Saesneg, winner of the chair awarded to the premier poet at the Carmarthen eisteddfod held under the patronage of Gruffudd ap Nicolas, <i>c</i>.1451. Gutun attended the eisteddfod as a young bardic pupil in the company of his teacher. As well as competitions for bards and musicians, metrical practices were discussed at Carmarthen, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd imposed his authority in introducing significant changes relating to the twenty-four bardic metres and the metrical ornamentation of <i>cynghanedd</i>. It was Gutun Owain's copies of the bardic grammar, a handbook used in bardic schools, which first incorporated these changes and provided the exemplar for later versions of that work. On the death of Dafydd ab Edmwnd some four decades later, Gutun composed a poignant elegy for his old teacher, celebrating his renown as a poet and recalling his triumph at Carmarthen.<br>
<br>Gutun Owain was one of the ablest practitioners of Welsh poetry during the late fifteenth century. More than sixty poems by him are extant, consisting in the main of eulogies and elegies to noble patrons, poems soliciting gifts, and love poems. A high proportion of his surviving work is addressed to patrons within a 15 mile radius of his home, in Maelor Gymraeg (Bromfield), Maelor Saesneg, Chirkland, and the commote of I&acirc;l, though a few poems show that he occasionally sought patronage further afield in north Wales. His two most important patrons, both abbots of the Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis near Llangollen, were his probable kinsman Si&ocirc;n ap Rhisiart (abbot until <i>c</i>.1480) and his successor Dafydd ab Ieuan ab Iorwerth (<i>c</i>.1480&#150;1503). Gutun's poems addressed to the two abbots vividly evoke their generous provision of wine and food on feast days, extol their restoration of the once neglected monastic buildings, and express his aesthetic appreciation of religious worship at the abbey. The poet also frequented the abbey of Basingwerk near Holywell, composing a poem in praise of Abbot Thomas Pennant and writing a portion of the <span class="roman">Black Book of Basingwerk</span> (NL Wales, MS 7006D).<br>
<br>Gutun's eulogies to lay patrons evoke the interests and concerns of the minor nobility of late fifteenth-century Wales, their pride in their ancestry, their joy in feasting, their martial prowess, and their enlightened support of the native culture. His elegies, though conventional to a large degree, are well wrought and quietly effective. Less original and robust than that of his contemporary Guto'r Glyn (for whom he composed an elegy), Gutun's muse was refined, fastidious, and meditative. His obvious delight in mellifluence and musicality, a characteristic particularly apparent in his <i>awdlau</i> (odes), may reflect the influence of his teacher Dafydd ab Edmwnd. As a poet he excels in these majestic, metrically complex <i>awdlau</i> and in his poems of solicitation on behalf of patrons, remarkable for their imaginative and vivid descriptions of gifts such as horses, hounds, and shields. In examples of the latter, barking hounds feature as &#145;harmonious, heavenly musicians&#146; and as &#145;bells of Durham cathedral&#146;, and the rivet heads on a buckler are described as &#145;powdered like the stars on the Milky Way&#146;.<br>
<br>Gutun Owain was familiar with all branches of traditional bardic learning. An expert genealogist, following the accession of Henry Tudor he assisted the commission appointed by the king&#151;which included Abbot Dafydd ab Ieuan ab Iorwerth&#151;to enquire into the Tudors' descent &#145;from the ancient British kings&#146;. Sixteenth-century genealogists frequently cited his manuscripts as sources. His activity as a scribe is exemplified in his nine surviving autograph manuscripts. They contain copies of chronicles and bruts (the most important being his texts of <span class="italic">Brut Tysilio</span> and <span class="italic">Brenhinedd y Saesson</span>, with a continuation to 1461, in the <span class="roman">Black Book of Basingwerk</span>), a bardic grammar, genealogies, a heraldic treatise, religious texts (including the Welsh life of St Martin), a &#145;Description of the island of Britain&#146; (a translation of the first book of Ranulf Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>), and miscellaneous lore (some of it of a pseudo-scientific nature).<br>
<br>Gutun Owain's latest datable surviving poem was composed in 1498. He may not have lived to witness the elevation of his patron, Abbot Dafydd ab Ieuan ab Iorwerth, to the see of St Asaph in 1500. According to traditional manuscript lists of the burial places of Welsh poets he was buried at St Martin's.<br>
