<span class="headword">Colebrooke, Sir  William Macbean George</span>  (1787&#150;1870), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was the son of Colonel Paulet Welbore Colebrooke RA (<i>d</i>. 28 Sept 1816) and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Major-General Grant. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and entered the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 17 August 1803.<br>
<br>In 1805 Colebrooke was ordered to the East Indies&#151;first to Ceylon, then in 1806 to Malabar, then in 1807 back to Ceylon. He went to India in 1809, served with the field army, and became a captain on 27 September 1810. He next served in Java, and was wounded in the operations against the Dutch in 1811; he stayed on under the British occupation, became deputy quartermaster-general in 1813, and was promoted major on 1 June 1813. He was sent as political agent and commissioner to Palembong in Sumatra, and to Bengal in 1814. He resumed his old duties in Java in 1815, and was ordered to India on the conclusion of peace and the restoration of Java to the Dutch on 19 August 1816. He served through the Anglo-Maratha War of 1817&#150;18, and accompanied the expedition to the Persian Gulf in 1818. In 1820 he married Emma Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1851), the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Colebrooke (<i>d</i>. 1808), surveyor-general of Bengal.<br>
<br>Colebrooke returned to England in 1821. From 1822 to 1832 he was a commissioner of the long and elaborate &#145;Eastern inquiry&#146; into the administration and revenues of Ceylon, and he resided there from 1829 to 1831. His fellow commissioner Charles Hay Cameron investigated the judicial system. Following his return to England Colebrooke submitted four reports recommending major reforms in Ceylon, which were largely implemented. In 1834 he became KH and on 9 September of that year was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Bahamas. He arrived at Nassau via Jamaica on 26 February 1835 and made his first speech to the assembly on 7 April. During his administration slavery gave way to the apprenticeship system prior to its final abolition, and Colebrooke was well informed of the problems which confronted him.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1837, while on leave in England, Colebrooke was gazetted as governor of the Leeward Islands. He was knighted on 31 March 1837. He assumed the government of Antigua and the other islands on 11 May 1837; one of his earliest official acts was the proclamation of Queen Victoria. In this government, as in the Bahamas, he was anxious to improve education and reform prison discipline; he also urged the restoration of the old general council of the Leewards, which had last met in 1798. On 25 July 1840 he left Antigua for Liverpool, and after an extended leave was on 26 March 1841 made lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. His attempts to reform the political system and create municipal institutions were thwarted by the provincial oligarchy. The question of the Maine boundary was then the chief public matter affecting the colony; Colebrooke's suggestion of a special scheme for colonization had no practical results. On 9 November 1846 he became colonel in the army, and on 27 November 1847 he was gazetted to British Guiana. However, he never took up the appointment, but proceeded instead on 11 August 1848 as governor to Barbados, where he also administered the Windward Islands. He continued his special interest in the suppression of crime and the improvement of the prisons, and his suggestions for a federation of all the Windward Islands foreshadowed much later proposals. In 1854 imperial troops were withdrawn from the smaller islands, but the island group remained peaceful and Colebrooke was well regarded by the people of Barbados. He became major-general on 20 June 1854.<br>
<br>In January 1856 Colebrooke relinquished his office and returned to England. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 16 January 1859 and general on 26 December 1865, and he was colonel commanding the Royal Artillery from 25 September 1859 until his death. He lived at Iver House, Salt Hill, near Slough, Buckinghamshire, where he died on 6 February 1870.<br>
