<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Payne,  Thomas</span>  (1716<span class="mult">x</span>18&#150;1799), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was baptized on 26 May 1719 in Brackley, Northamptonshire, the younger son of Olive or Oliver Payne, and his wife, Martha. His obituary and epitaph  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1799) variously describe him as being in his eighty-second year and aged eighty-two at the time of his death suggesting that he was born between 1716 and 1718. From <i>c</i>.1732 he was an assistant to his elder brother Olive (sometimes Oliver) Payne, a bookseller at Horace's Head, Round Court, opposite York Buildings in the Strand, London, who is said to have begun the practice of publishing regular catalogues of his stock. Following his brother's bankruptcy in March 1739 Thomas took over the business and issued his own catalogue in February 1741. In 1745 he married Elizabeth Taylor (<i>d</i>. in or before 1775), the sister of T. Taylor, a bookseller in Castle Street near the Mews Gate, Leicester Fields. In 1750 Payne succeeded to the business and premises of his brother-in-law, which were rebuilt in an L-shape. Thereafter his shop became known as the Literary Coffee House, from the many notable authors and collectors who frequented his salerooms.<br>
<br>After 1755 Payne steadily prospered both as a publisher and as a bookseller, and his name is to be found, together with those of other booksellers, on the imprints of many hundreds of works in all subjects. He was particularly involved in the publication of Richard Gough's enlarged 1789 edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, having financed all the engravings in return for the bulk of the copies of the new edition. However, he is primarily remembered as an antiquarian bookseller and for his part in disposing of the collections of many notable antiquaries and book collectors. Between 1755 and 1790 he issued annual (and on occasion semi-annual) catalogues of not fewer than 200 pages, most of which are listed by John Nichols in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>  (3.655&#150;60). Among the many notable collections he sold were those of Francis Peck, Ralph Thoresby, Benjamin Kennicott, and Francis Grose. He also visited Palgrave, Suffolk, in 1768 where he purchased many of the most valuable works from the library of Thomas Martin. Payne's success appears to have been based upon his shrewd purchases, together with a growing reputation among his customers for fair dealing, resulting in his widely known sobriquet Honest Tom Payne.<br>
<br>Thomas and Elizabeth Payne had two sons and one daughter. The elder son, also named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21656/', "Thomas Payne (1752&#150;1831)")</script>, was in partnership with his father from about 1776 and took over responsibility for the business when his father retired to Finchley in 1790. His daughter, Sarah (1759&#150;1832), married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4080/', "Admiral James Burney")</script> on 6 September 1785.<br>
<br>Payne is also known for his charitable works, notably his support of the impoverished and unrelated bookbinder Roger Payne for the last eight years of Roger's life, and paying for his burial. Payne also supported other members of his family in financial difficulty.<br>
<br>Payne died on 2 February 1799 at Finchley, and was buried there on 9 February alongside his wife and brother. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> describes him as &#145;warm in his friendships as in his politicks, a convivial cheerful companion&#146;, and refers to his &#145;character of an honest man to the last&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1799). Dibdin describes him in his <span class="italic">Bibliographical decameron</span> as &#145;a sterling example of genuine British integrity. There was neither pomp, nor parade, nor knavery, nor vehemence, nor violence, in any thing he said or did&#146;  (Dibdin, 436). The poet William Hayley likewise presented Payne's son with an epitaph in verse which was subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Payne should not be confused with his two contemporary London namesakes: the bookseller at 14 Duke Street and the bookbinder of 24 Charlotte Street.<br>
