<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett,  William Henry</span>  (1855&#150;1920), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 22 May 1855 at 1 Conduit Street, Paddington, London, the son of William Emmanuel Bennett, draper, and his wife, Emily Brice. He was educated at the City of London School under E. A. Abbott, and proceeded to Lancashire Independent college, Manchester, in 1873. Although a near contemporary at the college, J. P. Kingsland, recalled Bennett's kindly disposition, he also remarked upon &#145;the extreme difficulty he experienced in writing a sermon for Sermon Class. I have often wondered whether he succeeded later in writing a passable sermon!&#146;  (Kingsland, 176). There was clearly some improvement, for at his death Bennett was remembered by a friend as one who spoke &#145;home to the conscience and to the heart&#146;, though another noted that &#145;his pulpit style was not what the ordinary congregation regarded as popular&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 28 Aug 1920). While in Manchester, Bennett graduated from the University of London with second-class honours in mathematics in 1875 and an MA in that subject in 1876. From 1878 to 1882 he was at St John's College, Cambridge, on leave from Lancashire College. He gained his Cambridge BA with first-class honours in the theological tripos in 1882, and proceeded MA in 1885. He won a number of prizes and was elected a fellow of his college, the first Free Churchman to be thus honoured in Cambridge. In 1902 he became LittD of Cambridge as well as DD at the University of Aberdeen, where the ceremony was somewhat disturbed by younger graduands.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1884, Bennett had been appointed professor of Hebrew, church history and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> at Rotherham Independent college, and on 31 March 1885 he married Annie, daughter of R. J. Wibley, grocer, of Market Hill and Hurst, Cambridge, at Victoria Road Congregational Church, Cambridge. They had two daughters. While at Rotherham, Bennett lectured in Hebrew at Firth College, the predecessor of the University of Sheffield, and from 1888 to 1913 he was professor of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> exegesis at Hackney College, London, assuming in addition the identical role at New College, London, from 1891. Recalling his own appointment to New College, A. E. Garvie described Bennett as &#145;the soul of magnanimity in welcoming and working with me as Principal for some years&#146;, remarking that &#145;on the Senate of London University he surprised many as a &#147;man of affairs&#148;&#146;  (Garvie, 230&#150;31). Bennett served as dean of the faculty of theology, and as examiner to the universities of London, Wales, Manchester, and Bristol. Garvie further considered that the demands of the principalship of Lancashire Independent college, which, on the retirement of Walter F. Adeney, Bennett accepted in 1913, probably shortened his life; certainly the management of the college during the First World War imposed added burdens upon him.<br>
<br>Bennett enjoyed excellent relations with colleagues and students alike, though he never courted popularity and could be self-deprecating. When it was suggested to him that he might consider becoming principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, he replied, &#145;They need a popular preacher and a man of the world, and I am neither&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, 9 Sept 1920, 443). Modest himself, he knew how to prick the pretensions of the pompous.<br>
<br>While at Hackney and at New colleges, Bennett collaborated with Adeney on <span class="italic">The Bible Story Re-Told for Young People</span> (1897), <span class="italic">A Biblical Introduction</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">The Bible and Criticism</span> (1912). An example of Bennett's wry humour occurs in his introduction to the 1912 volume. In the wake of the &#145;Downgrade&#146; controversy which was orchestrated by the Baptist C. H. Spurgeon, Bennett wrote, &#145;&#147;Higher Criticism&#148; forms and expresses judgments as to the date, authorship, and mode of composition of a book. When Mr. Spurgeon expressed such judgments he was a &#147;Higher Critic&#148;&#146;  (p. viii). In 1887, when the controversy was at its height, and in response to the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>'s question, &#145;Are Nonconformists departing from the faith?&#146;, Bennett suggested that there were changes of terminology rather than of substance, and that for the most part nonconformists remained evangelical in doctrine.<br>
<br>Bennett was the sole author of <span class="italic">The Mishna as Illustrating the Gospels</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">A Primer of the Bible</span> (1897). He contributed the volumes on <span class="roman">Chronicles</span> (1894) and <span class="roman">Jeremiah</span> 21&#150;52 (1895) to the <span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, those on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> and <span class="roman">Exodus</span> to the <span class="roman">Century Bible</span>, and <span class="roman">Joshua</span>, a new translation, illustrated and &#145;with colours exhibiting the composite structure of the book&#146;, to <span class="italic">The Polychrome Bible</span> (1899). This was followed by <span class="italic">Joshua and the Conquest of Palestine</span> (1904). In 1907 his <span class="italic">Religion of the Post-Exilic Prophets</span> appeared. Here Bennett introduced the prophets in chronological order and then expounded their teaching in relation to the standard themes of dogmatics. While he admitted that a new reformation of theological thought, comparable with that of the sixteenth-century Reformation, was required, he considered that the scholarship of the time, both biblical and scientific, was too much in a state of flux for any such enterprise to succeed. In 1909 his <span class="italic">Old Testament History</span> appeared, followed by <span class="italic">The Moabite Stone</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Historical Value of the Old Testament</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Value of the Old Testament for To-Day</span> (1914), and (for young people) <span class="italic">The Bible: its Place in the Christian Life</span> (1918).<br>
<br>Though pre-eminently concerned with the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> (he was the first president of the Society for Old Testament Study, from 1917 to 1920), Bennett also published <span class="italic">The Life of Christ According to St Mark</span> (1907), in which he sought to reproduce the impression of Christ which would be gained by a reader who had no other source of knowledge of Jesus than this gospel. Bennett also contributed the volume on the general epistles, <span class="roman">James</span>, <span class="roman">Peter</span>, <span class="roman">John</span>, and <span class="roman">Jude</span>, to the <span class="roman">Century Bible</span>, and published a pamphlet on <span class="italic">The Congregational Churches</span> (1910). Among his other writings are articles in <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia biblica</span>, <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, <span class="italic">Hastings Dictionary of the Bible</span>, the <span class="roman">Expositor's Bible</span>, and chapters in <span class="italic">Faith and Criticism</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">Christianity and Civilization</span> (1910). Bennett died aged sixty-five on 27 August 1920 at Lancashire College, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Bennett was a &#145;believing critic&#146;: P. T. Forsyth described him as one who taught the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in the spirit of the <span class="roman">New</span>. Over and above his careful if not earth-shaking studies of biblical texts and themes, his contribution lay in keeping his head and helping others to find their feet in the wake of the &#145;higher criticism&#146;. It is not wildly speculative to surmise that but for the work of scholars such as Bennett and his Manchester colleagues, the Wesleyan J. H. Moulton and the Primitive Methodist A. S. Peake, the reaction against biblical criticism and towards fundamentalist literalism would have been much stronger than it proved to be in Britain. The words with which Bennett and Adeney concluded the preface to their <span class="italic">Biblical Introduction</span> epitomized their work as a whole:<blockquote>The authors of this volume trust that it may help its readers to a truer understanding of the sacred Scriptures, and to a fuller appreciation of their unique importance; and may confirm them in the evangelical recognition of the supreme authority of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as interpreted and applied by the Holy Spirit for the spiritual life. (Bennett and Adeney, <span class="italic">Biblical Introduction</span>, vii)</blockquote>
