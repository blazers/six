</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conolly,  John</span>  (1794&#150;1866), <span class="occ">physician and alienist</span>, was born at his grandmother's house in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, on 27 May 1794, the second of three sons of Jonathon Conolly, an impecunious Anglo-Irish gentleman of no fixed pursuits, and of his wife, Dorothy Tennyson (1761&#150;1816), a distant relative of the family of the future poet laureate. After his father's premature death about 1799 John was separated from his brothers and boarded out &#145;like an inconvenient superfluity&#146;  (Leigh, 211&#150;15) with an elderly relative in Hedon, Yorkshire. Here he passed a barren and wretched childhood, receiving a Dickensian education at the local grammar school. His mother moved to Kingston upon Hull in 1803, supporting herself by opening a boarding-school for young ladies, and married a French &eacute;migr&eacute; who taught languages, a Mr Stirling. In 1807 young John came to live with them, learning French and acquiring a rudimentary general education from his stepfather. At eighteen he secured an ensign's commission in the Cambridgeshire militia, and he spent the closing years of the Napoleonic wars in Scotland and Ireland.<br>
<br>Conolly's military career ended with Napoleon's defeat and he returned to Hull shortly before his mother's death in 1816. There, on 6 March 1817, he married Elizabeth Collins (1784&#150;1866), the impoverished daughter of the recently deceased Sir John Collins, a naval captain. They left immediately for a cottage near Tours on the Loire, where his older brother, William, was already engaged in the practice of medicine. A year later, with a young daughter, Eliza (<i>b</i>. 1818), and with his own meagre capital rapidly diminishing, Conolly urgently needed a stable source of income. Like many middle-class men of his generation he chose a career in medicine. He is said to have matriculated at Glasgow University in 1818, although there is no mention of him in the <span class="italic">Matriculation Albums</span>, and did so at Edinburgh University in 1819, from where he graduated MD in 1821, having written a thesis &#145;De statu mentis in insania et melancholia&#146;. At Edinburgh he was strongly influenced by Dugald Stewart, and served as one of the four annual presidents of the Royal Medical Society.<br>
<br>Lacking the social and intellectual capital essential for metropolitan practice, Conolly moved to Lewes and then Chichester, but was unable to establish himself in what was by now an increasingly overcrowded and competitive profession. His vivacity and charm made him a favourite of the local notables as a social companion, but his lack of faith in his own remedies and his deficiencies as a clinician meant that when ill his well-to-do acquaintances preferred to consult his friend and rival, John Forbes. Shortly after the birth of his second child, his son Edward Tennyson (1822&#150;1908), Conolly therefore moved again, this time to the small town of Stratford upon Avon. Here he enjoyed moderate success, taking a leading role in establishing a dispensary for the sick poor, being elected to the town council, and twice serving as mayor&#151;a well-worn path for a young practitioner trying to make his way. He also assisted James Copland in editing the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span>. Reflecting his earlier interest in insanity, and as a supplement to his still meagre income, he obtained an appointment as inspecting physician to the lunatic houses for the county of Warwick, a position that required only that he accompany two justices of the peace on their annual inspection of the county's half dozen madhouses. Still, in his best year his income did not exceed &pound;400, barely sufficient to sustain a professional man with a growing family, now including another daughter, Sophia Jane (1826&#150;1888). Suddenly, however, the intervention of two patrons from Conolly's Edinburgh days, George Birkbeck and Lord Henry Brougham, offered him the chance to substitute the rewards of a London teaching and consulting practice for the dull routines of provincial general practice. His sponsors, among the prime movers in establishing the new University of London, and, like Conolly, members of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, secured Conolly's appointment as professor of the nature and treatment of diseases, a position he took up in October 1828.<br>
<br>In its early years the medical school at the new university was on a shaky financial footing. There were, besides, recurrent clashes between the medical staff and the new warden, Leonard Horner, for whom Conolly developed a particular antipathy. In this uncertain environment he proved incapable of succeeding, turning out to be a poor lecturer and showing himself once again incapable of attracting upper-class patients to his private practice. Conolly's attempts to pioneer clinical instruction in the treatment of mental disorders at a London asylum were repeatedly rebuffed. Nor was his book on the subject, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Indications of Insanity</span> (1830), a critical success, perhaps in part because he broke with emerging orthodoxy to argue that asylum treatment was actively harmful in most instances, and where absolutely unavoidable should be provided only in publicly funded institutions whose governors would not be tempted to put their own financial interests before the needs of their patients. Increasingly in debt, and now with a fourth child, Anne Caroline (1830&#150;1911), Conolly evidently despaired of his prospects in London. On 4 December 1830 he abruptly and impetuously resigned his professorship, retreating once more to the provinces. Quickly finding that he could not resume his Stratford practice he was forced to move to Warwick, where for the next seven years he struggled to make his way, joining the new Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (later the British Medical Association) and co-editing, with John Forbes, the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span>. Again he had little success as a clinician, and again he responded by impulsively seeking a radical change, applying in 1838 (much to the consternation of his friends) for the vacant post of superintendent of the Hanwell County Asylum in Middlesex. His progressive politics and active espousal of working-class education offended conservative members of the Middlesex bench, however, and he narrowly lost the election to an army surgeon, J. R. Millingen.<br>
<br>Little to this point suggested that Conolly would become more than an obscure historical footnote, let alone the most famous alienist of his generation. Within a year, however, Millingen's regime at Hanwell had proved a catastrophic failure, and when the magistrates demanded his resignation, Conolly secured the post that had previously eluded him. Within months of his arrival in the autumn of 1839 he became the focus of national and even international attention, following his announcement that all forms of mechanical restraint&#151;chains, manacles, strait-jackets, and the like&#151;had been destroyed, and replaced by a purely moral suasion and discipline. The new system of non-restraint was initially controversial. Many of Conolly's fellow alienists insisted that restraint was essential in the therapeutics of mental disorder. Others rallied to the abolitionist cause, however, notably <span class="italic">The Times</span> and Thomas Wakley, the crusading editor of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. When Lord Ashley (leader of the parliamentary forces pressing for lunacy reform) was also won over, success was assured&#151;as was Conolly's own position at the head of the newly emerging group of experts in the treatment of the mad. Elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1844, he was subsequently the recipient of an honorary DCL from Oxford University, and was f&ecirc;ted at the annual gathering of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association in 1850.<br>
<br>Such extraordinary praise and recognition suggest that Conolly's achievement had a symbolic significance for the Victorian bourgeoisie that extended far beyond its contribution to the welfare of the mad. Confronted by the threats of Chartism and a militant working class, surrounded by the all but inescapable evidence of the devastating impact of industrial capitalism on the social and physical landscape, and themselves the authors of a new poor law assailed by its critics as the very embodiment of inhumanity and meanness of spirit, the Victorian governing classes could at least find a source of pride in the generous and kindly treatment now accorded to the lunatic. By demonstrating that even the irrational and raving could be reduced to docility, and without resort to force, Conolly appeared to have richly earned his audience's applause.<br>
<br>Oddly enough, non-restraint was not Conolly's innovation at all. The approach had been pioneered in 1838 in a small provincial asylum in Lincoln by an obscure house surgeon, Robert Gardiner Hill. Conolly visited Lincoln before taking up his appointment at Hanwell and noted his admiration of Hill's system in the visitors' book. In later years, however, he and his metropolitan allies systematically obscured Hill's claims as the originator of the system, arousing the latter's largely impotent fury.<br>
<br>Despite his inability to manage his own financial affairs with even a modicum of skill, Conolly proved an able administrator of the huge pauper establishment at Hanwell, a ramshackle and overcrowded poor law asylum that prefigured the overgrown &#145;museums of madness&#146; that were to constitute the Victorians' response to the problems posed by the lunatic. Despite its dismally low cure rate and continuous overcrowding, his asylum was widely regarded as a splendid advertisement for lunacy reform, and Conolly himself, once publicly opposed to segregating the insane into specialized institutions save as a last resort, now became one of the most vigorous advocates of an expanded network of asylums.<br>
<br>Conolly's lectures in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, &#145;On the construction and government of lunatic asylums&#146;, were republished as a monograph in 1847. Even before their appearance, however, Conolly's connections with Hanwell had been sharply attenuated. In 1844 the Middlesex magistrates, always inclined to meddle in the administration of their asylum, decided to divide the task of running Hanwell, restricting Conolly's responsibilities to the medical treatment of the patients, and entrusting primary authority over the day-to-day administration of the asylum to a layman and retired army officer, John Godwin. Viewing these arrangements as an intolerable affront, Conolly had promptly resigned, accepting, as a face-saving gesture for both sides, a subsequent appointment as visiting physician (a position he would eventually relinquish in 1852).<br>
<br>Forced to seek an alternative means of earning his livelihood, Conolly's situation was made the more desperate by pressing domestic worries. His wife, Elizabeth, had simply disappeared from public view at about the time he took up his initial appointment at Hanwell. There have been published suggestions, based on purely circumstantial evidence, that she may herself have become insane. Certainly, she lived apart from him for much of her life, her death occurring four months after his, on 19 July 1866, while being cared for in lodgings in Hill Street, Knightsbridge, London. Besides whatever financial and emotional strain his wife's circumstances may have represented, Conolly's children constituted a continuing and even a growing financial burden. Though his oldest daughter, Eliza, had married an impoverished missionary to China, William Goodall, in 1842, his other two daughters were still his dependants, as was his feckless son, Edward Tennyson. Sophia Jane married Conolly's fellow alienist, Thomas Harrington Tuke, in 1852, but her departure from the household was more than offset when her wayward brother fathered an illegitimate child, and then six more children after his marriage in 1855, all the while failing to find gainful employment and remaining essentially dependent upon paternal largess.<br>
<br>Despite the fierce attacks Conolly had made as a young man on the practice of &#145;trading in lunacy&#146;, he thus had little alternative but to enter the mad-business. Securing a licence to open his Hanwell residence, The Lawn, as a private asylum for the reception of up to six &#145;insane ladies&#146;, he supplemented his income from this source with appearances as an expert witness, both in criminal cases where the insanity defence was raised, and in chancery court inquisitions in lunacy, where the sanity of sundry socially prominent people was litigated. Not always scrupulous about observing the technicalities of the lunacy laws, Conolly was on occasion successfully sued for damages for false imprisonment. Nor did he make an impressive expert witness, being excoriated as all too prone to consign the immoral or merely eccentric to the ranks of the insane.<br>
<br>During his years in private practice, Conolly wrote a lengthy monograph on <span class="italic">The Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraints</span> (1856). His model of asylum practice had by this time become the ruling orthodoxy, particularly in the expanding county asylum system, and his standing as the doyen of alienists was recognized by his election in 1859 as president of their professional society, the Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane (a post he had previously held in 1844). By 1860 he had largely abandoned private practice for retirement. He worked intermittently on <span class="italic">A Study of Hamlet</span> (1863)&#151;a book devoted to demonstrating that the prince was indeed mad&#151;and enjoyed the flattering attentions of a small group of ambitious young alienists who gathered regularly at his house. One of their number, Henry Maudsley (1835&#150;1918), a cold and cynical man who would soon succeed Conolly as the leading English alienist, married his daughter Anne Caroline in January 1866.<br>
<br>For several years Conolly's health had been deteriorating. It now worsened sharply. On 4 March 1866 he suffered a series of seizures, culminating in a massive stroke that led to his death the next day at The Lawn, Hanwell. He was buried at Kensington Hanwell cemetery, Ealing, Middlesex.<br>
