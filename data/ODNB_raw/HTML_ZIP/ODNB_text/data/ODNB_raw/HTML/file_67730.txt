<span class="headword">Stirling,  Emma Maitland</span>  (1838/9&#150;1907), <span class="occ">activist in child welfare and emigration to Canada</span>, was born in Edinburgh, youngest of the eleven children of John Stirling (1786&#150;1853), financier and landed gentleman, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willing (1798/9&#150;1874) of Philadelphia. A tradition of intermarriage, born of transatlantic trade connections, linked the Stirling and Willing families through several generations. In 1827 the family moved to Cathedral Place, St Andrews, where Emma was raised.<br>
<br>Stirling's youth was punctuated by the deaths of six of her siblings, two of whom were killed in the Crimean War. The family were devout members of the Scottish Episcopal church, and Stirling's intense religious convictions motivated her later philanthropic work. Nothing is known of her own schooling, but she became keenly interested in children and education during the many years she spent caring for her blind mother. As E. M. S. she published a work of children's literature, <span class="italic">The History of a Pin</span> (1861), which adumbrated her later career in child welfare.<br>
<br>A substantial inheritance permitted Stirling to move to Edinburgh and pursue her own interests. In early 1877 she founded the Stockbridge Day Nursery and Infant Home, which offered childminding for working mothers and residential care for motherless children. Soon the day nursery and the home accommodated fifty children each. Parents paid a small daily fee, but Stirling subsidized both operations and took in some motherless children for no fee. In 1878 she appointed a board of directors to advise her, and adopted the name Edinburgh and Leith Children's Aid and Refuge Society.<br>
<br>In 1884 Stirling opened the first Shelter from Cruelty for abused children in Edinburgh at 150 High Street. A rival Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (SPCC) sputtered along until its patrons were obliged to join Stirling's institution. The following year the earl of Aberdeen agreed to act as patron of her organization, and Stirling was at the zenith of her career in Scotland, with some 300 children under her care in eight homes. She next plunged into child emigration with the purchase of a farm at Aylesford, Nova Scotia, to which she sent 200 or more Scottish children over the next decade.<br>
<br>Nova Scotia was not a major centre for child emigration, and why Stirling chose it is uncertain. Her account of the venture in <span class="italic">Our Children in Old Scotland and Nova Scotia</span> (1892, republished with sequel, 1898) suggests a rather romanticized view of the Canadian province as a new and purer Scotland. Emigrant children would be acclimatized at Hillfoot Farm, picturesquely situated in the fertile Annapolis valley, before being sent to farmers or into domestic service in eastern Canada. Once the children left the farm about the age of twelve, Stirling seems to have taken little interest in them, and she displayed no compunction about sending siblings to widely separated employers.<br>
<br>Relations between Stirling and her board of directors had chilled when she announced her departure for Nova Scotia and her withdrawal of financial support. They reached their nadir after Stirling's rash actions embroiled the board in litigation on both sides of the Atlantic: in several cases she illegally sent motherless children in her care to Nova Scotia without paternal consent. Ultimately Stirling agreed to pay all legal costs if her name were featured on the title page of the annual report of the Scottish National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, formed in 1894 by a merger of her institution and the Glasgow SPCC. When the society ceased to display her name after her death, her descent into obscurity began.<br>
<br>In 1895 Stirling's farmhouse was destroyed by arsonists. She had alienated local opinion by laying charges against a physician who had allegedly performed an abortion on one of her former charges. The man's acquittal and the subsequent fire caused Stirling to abandon not only her idealistic view of Nova Scotia but the province itself. She moved to a small town near Philadelphia, where she devoted herself principally to the cause of animal welfare until her death on 2 September 1907 at her home, Drumpellier, Coatesville, Caln township, Chester county, Pennsylvania. She never married, and her will directed her $35,000 estate to be divided among certain charities and a few friends.<br>
<br>Stirling's gender and her permanent departure from Britain allowed her pioneering role in British child welfare to be forgotten: the official history of the Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children virtually ignores her  (Ashley, 30). A prickly and imperious nature alienated contemporaries, but gender stereotypes contributed to these perceptions. Stirling's wealth allowed her a freedom which was not accepted by the men around her. A social conservative, she saw no future for her waifs in Scotland, but did not believe that the state should play a significant role in ameliorating their lot. Emma Stirling forcefully brought to public attention the plight of poor and abused children and acted on her convictions, even if her solutions were ultimately untenable.<br>
