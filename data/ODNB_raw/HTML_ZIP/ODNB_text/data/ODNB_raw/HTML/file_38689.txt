<span class="headword">Philips, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1766&#150;1847), <span class="occ">textile industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 24 March 1766, the second son of the eight children of Thomas Philips (1728&#150;1811), a Manchester merchant (later of Sedgley), and his wife, Mary Jolley (<i>d</i>. 1806), the daughter and heir of John Rider, also a Manchester merchant, and his wife, Sarah. The Philips family formed a large kinship group extensively involved in the growth of the eighteenth-century textile industry from their roots as yeomen in Staffordshire. Philips's father was a partner in the pioneering firm of J. and N. Philips, the largest tape manufacturers in Europe, but was also involved in a hatting business with a growing American market in the late 1780s. He first sent his son to Chetham's School in Manchester, although later he was moved to dissenting schools, first Stand grammar school, then Mr Harrison's Unitarian school at Manchester. Philips escaped the toils of his narrow Wesleyan Methodist upbringing through a growing association with the Philipses of Hollinghurst, whom he considered &#145;greatly superior in manners and knowledge of the world&#146;  (Philips, fol. 8), and on 16 October 1788 he married Sarah Anne, the daughter of Nathaniel Philips. A keen autodidact, Philips was active in Manchester's cultural life (through its Literary and Philosophical Society and the Portico Library) and its radical politics, with John Ferriar, Thomas Walker, and Dr Thomas Cooper among his friends. In 1792 he published <span class="italic">The Necessity of a Speedy and Effectual Reform in Parliament</span>, a forceful plea for universal, including female, suffrage, but one he was soon eager to disavow. In this heady period of social defiance, he also indulged openly in a passionate adulterous affair, alienating many of his Manchester friends.<br>
<br>However, Philips's abounding energies were most keenly consumed in exploiting the vast commercial opportunities of the 1790s through a series of business ventures which mark him out as one of the most successful and wealthiest entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution. Firstly, J. and N. Philips, with mills in Staffordshire and Lancashire as well as warehouses in Manchester, continued to prosper, producing huge rewards, from which he withdrew over &pound;250,000 between 1807 and 1831. Secondly, the Salford twist mill, an offshoot of the former, was conducted by Philips with the extremely talented G. A. Lee (1761&#150;1826) as manager. This was one of Manchester's largest and most technologically advanced cotton-spinning factories&#151;one of Manchester's first iron-framed buildings and the first mill to use gas lighting. Thirdly, T. Philips &amp; Co. (Manchester and London), although wound down after his father's death, left Philips with a network of properties in Manchester and America, which continued to offer considerable rental income. Finally, Philips was also a partner in Boddington, Philips, and Sharp, a firm of West Indian merchants, with lucrative trading operations in sugar and other goods. Philips was no mere sleeping partner in these ventures but conducted an active search for new markets, took a keen interest in technological change, made good use of his extensive contacts in London, Manchester, and America, and, most importantly, chose and retained able managers.<br>
<br>Even so, like many first-generation industrialists, Philips was socially ambitious. Given his ample wealth, and through his partner &#145;Conversation&#146; Sharp&#151;Richard Sharp (1759&#150;1835)&#151;he found a ready entr&eacute;e into metropolitan whig politics, joining, for example, Sir James Mackintosh's dining club known as the King of Clubs in 1807. His son, George Richard (1789&#150;1883), was sent to Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1819 married Sarah Georgiana, the daughter of Lord Waterpark. Intent on entering parliament, Philips was brought in by Sir William Manners for Ilchester in 1812 at a cost of &pound;5000. In 1818, following a loan of &pound;50,000 to the duke of Norfolk, Philips displaced Creevey at Steyning, where he was in turn succeeded in 1820 by his son. Philips himself, supported by prudent purchases of property, sat for Wootton Bassett from 1820 to 1830, thus for a third time representing one of the corrupt boroughs he aspired to abolish.<br>
<br>Unlike many textile magnates, Philips was a ready speaker in the House of Commons, and was an early advocate of free trade, an opponent of factory legislation, and a critic of trade unions; he spoke up for the peaceable intentions of the Lancashire reformers in 1818 and after Peterloo. He undoubtedly proved an effective voice for the cotton industry, well deserving his reputation as the &#145;unofficial member for Manchester&#146;  (Wadsworth and De Mann, 289). He maintained close links with the business community, acting as first chairman of the Manchester Royal Exchange, working with the Manchester chamber of commerce, and helping found the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> in 1821. He also sought local subscriptions to London University. He enjoyed the friendship of leading whigs, including Grattan, Tierney, and Lord Holland. The wit the Revd Sydney Smith regularly visited Sedgley, where he amiably mocked his host&#151;&#145;the cotton king&#146;, &#145;Philosopher Philips&#146;, or &#145;Marcus Tullius Philips&#146;, who &#145;doubles his capital twice a week; we talk much of cotton, more of the fine arts, as he has lately returned from Italy, and purchased some pictures which were sent out from Piccadilly on purpose to intercept him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sydney Smith</span>, 1.365&#150;6).<br>
<br>Unusually, Philips's pursuit of landed status followed rather than preceded entry to the Commons, and it was only after a prolonged search that in 1819 he committed his money to land. Following the lead of his Manchester cousin and partner, Robert Philips (1760&#150;1844), he acquired sizeable estates (some 3500 acres by 1827) in Warwickshire. As a result, in 1827 he finally retreated from the smoke of Sedgley to Weston House, Long Compton, rebuilt in Gothic revival style by Edward Blore at a considerable cost and fashionably furnished by A. W. N. Pugin. In 1828 he was made a baronet by Lord Goderich's ministry, only the second cotton spinner to achieve this status. He left parliament in 1830, but in 1832 he was brought out by his new Liberal neighbours in South Warwickshire (to the disgust of some local tories), and, despite having suitably cut his cloth to defend the corn laws, he finally retired from parliament in 1834. In rustic seclusion, he enjoyed the social rewards of his ample profit making, acting as JP, host, and art patron, while venturing to London for the intellectual refinement of the Royal Institution. The tranquillity of domestic life also precipitated a vivid religious conversion, and, following the death on 2 September 1844 of the wife he had betrayed in his youth, he composed his memoirs, one of the few introspective documents produced by the entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution, recording the exploits of an ambitious, vainglorious, impetuous, and restless man of parts, now a repentant sinner. Philips died at Weston House on 3 October 1847 and was buried at Long Compton, a parish in which, following his wife's example, he had acted as a conscientious landlord. He was succeeded by his only child, who maintained a profitable if remote link with the Manchester business, while enjoying parliament, landed society, and the aristocratic connections reinforced by the marriages of his three daughters.<br>
