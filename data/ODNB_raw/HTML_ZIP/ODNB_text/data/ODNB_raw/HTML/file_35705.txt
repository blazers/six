<span class="headword">Redpath,  Henry Adeney</span>  (1848&#150;1908), <span class="occ">biblical and linguistic scholar</span>, was born at Sydenham, Kent, on 19 June 1848, the eldest son of Henry Syme Redpath, solicitor, of Sydenham, and his wife, Harriet Adeney, of Islington. In 1857 he entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, and in 1867 he won a scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford. He was awarded a second class in classical moderations in 1869 and a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1871; he graduated BA in 1871, MA in 1874, and DLitt in 1901. Ordained deacon in 1872 and priest in 1874, Redpath, after being curate of Southam, near Rugby, and then of Luddesdown, near Gravesend, was successively vicar of Wolvercote, near Oxford (1880&#150;83) and rector of Holwell, Sherborne (1883&#150;90). On 5 October 1886, at Marsh Caundle, Dorset, he married Catherine Helen, daughter of Henry Peter Auber of Marsh Court, Sherborne. They had one son before her death at Shottermill, Surrey, on 26 August 1898.<br>
<br>Redpath served as vicar of Sparsholt with Kingston Lisle, near Wantage, from 1890 to 1898, when he exchanged this job to become rector of St Dunstan-in-the-East, in the City of London. He was also sub-warden of the Society of Sacred Study in the diocese of London, and examining chaplain to the bishop of London from 1905 to 1908. Redpath, who had learned Hebrew at Merchant Taylors' School, specialized while a country parson in the Greek of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, completing and publishing a work which the theologian and religious historian Edwin Hatch had left unfinished: <span class="italic">A Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Translations of the Old Testament</span> (3 vols., 1892&#150;1906). The work found recognition both in England and in Europe. Redpath was Grinfield lecturer on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> at Oxford from 1901 to 1905, and shortly before his death he designed a <span class="italic">Dictionary of Patristic Greek</span>.<br>
<br>Redpath's biblical scholarship was conservative. He was reactionary in his opposition to the critical approach to the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, arguing in <span class="italic">Modern Criticism and the Book of Genesis</span> (1905), published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, that <span class="roman">Genesis</span> was not of a composite structure. A work which was much more favourably received was his painstaking <span class="italic">Westminster Commentary</span> on <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span>, with introduction and notes (1907). He also contributed to James Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> (4 vols., 1904) and to the <span class="italic">Illustrated Bible Dictionary</span>. Redpath died at 35 Kirkdale, Sydenham, on 24 September 1908, and was buried at Shottermill, Surrey.<br>
