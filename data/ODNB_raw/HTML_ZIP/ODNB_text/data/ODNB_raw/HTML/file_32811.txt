</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dicey,  Albert Venn</span>  (1835&#150;1922), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was the third son of Thomas Edward Dicey (<i>b</i>. 1789), proprietor of the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>, and his wife, Anne Mary, younger daughter of James Stephen, master in chancery, and was born at the family home, Claybrook Hall, near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on 4 February 1835. The name Venn was given to him in honour of the leader of the Clapham sect John Venn, whose daughter Jane had married Anne Dicey's brother, Sir James Stephen. Obstetrical error at birth caused a muscular weakness that plagued Dicey throughout life. His handwriting was notoriously difficult to decipher and many of his adult letters were written by an amanuensis. His early education came at home and Dicey recalled in later life his happy memories of lessons taught by his mother. Dicey entered King's College School in London in 1852 and then matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1854. He obtained a first class in classical moderations in 1856 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1858. At Oxford he helped found the Old Mortality society that in a brief existence included a number of individuals who afterwards attained distinction. Among them were Thomas Hill Green, Edward Caird, Algernon Charles Swinburne, James Bryce, and Thomas Erskine Holland. To his Oxford years Dicey owed many of the friendships that he treasured later in life, especially that with Bryce.<br>
<br>In 1860 Dicey was successful in an examination for a fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford, and in the same year he won the Arnold prize for an essay on the privy council, which was published in the same year. Dicey attributed his lifelong interest in constitutional law and history to this work. He moved to London in 1861 and studied for the bar at the Inner Temple, to which he was called in 1863. He enjoyed moderate success at the bar and eventually became queen's counsel in 1890. In 1872 he forfeited his fellowship when he married Elinor Mary Bonham-Carter (<i>d</i>. 1923), youngest daughter of John Bonham-Carter (MP for Portsmouth from 1830 to 1841). The marriage, which lasted for fifty years, produced no children; it was a long, happy companionship, marred only by frequent bouts of illness, to which Elinor Dicey was subject.<br>
<br>During his residence in London from 1861 to 1882 Dicey practised at the bar and pursued journalistic and scholarly projects. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span> (of which he occasionally acted as temporary editor), the <span class="italic">Spectator</span>, and the New York <span class="italic">Nation</span>. The articles in the <span class="italic">Nation</span> provide an excellent record of his political and intellectual maturation. During this period Dicey published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Rules for the Selection of the Parties to an Action</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">The Law of Domicil, as a Branch of the Law of England, Stated in the Form of Rules</span> (1879). Neither book earned an extensive readership but, by virtue of the scholarly reputation of each, Dicey was elected in 1882 to the Vinerian professorship of English law at Oxford. He held this chair, to which a fellowship at All Souls College was attached, for twenty-seven years; he revived its importance after a long period of absentee occupants since the resignation of Sir William Blackstone in 1766.<br>
<br>During his long professorship, Dicey published the three books that gave him a significant place in common-law jurisprudence. His <span class="italic">Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution</span> (1885), updated by a lengthy introduction to the eighth edition (1915), established his reputation as a major commentator on the British constitution. Focus on three fundamental principles, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, and constitutional conventions, enabled Dicey to provide for the general public an understanding of constitutional law. The clarity of his prose made the work accessible to a wide spectrum of educated opinion, and his ability to reduce the complex topic to three concepts caused him to refer to himself as a prophet of the obvious. His facility for analysis made the work a classic of exposition and ensured its place as a primary influence on the discussion of constitutional law from its first appearance.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Law of the Constitution</span> owed the popularity of its reception as well to polemic features which belied its expository and limited explicit intentions; notably it was a broadly whiggish account of England's history which was implicitly celebratory of English national identity. The centrality of the common law to English history, Dicey held, had produced a tradition of liberty that reached full flower in the individualism so important to Victorian ideas of self. This legacy separated England from the <i>droit administratif</i> institutions in France, where freedom depended upon government licence. His statement of the superiority of England's political heritage placed Dicey squarely in the Burkean tradition and marked out <span class="italic">Law of the Constitution</span> as a work of political theory, not simply legal analysis. Even the book's modest self-representation as simply a piece of legal analysis had implicit polemical force. Academic legal science was a recently established discipline, the credibility of which was an issue which preoccupied Dicey. A work which so successfully imported England's common law into its population's sense of its heritage and identity, and one which did so not in the language of abstract theory but by the detailed examination of the law, did a great deal to secure the reputation of the discipline. And just as Dicey championed the science of law he championed also the lawyers: in his legalistic overhaul of the whig account, it was judges and not statesmen who emerged as the upholders of liberty.<br>
<br>In 1896 Dicey published <span class="italic">A Digest of the Law of England with Reference to the Conflict of Laws</span>, his greatest treatise with respect to a mastery of an intricate branch of the law. His ability to consolidate the complex, copious case-law in this area into a limited number of rules exerted a strong influence on the law's development, according to his successor in the Vinerian chair, William Martin Geldart. Successive editions, edited by J. H. C. Morris after Dicey's death, retained the book's place in legal scholarship.<br>
<br>The third book Dicey completed as Vinerian professor was <span class="italic">Lectures on the Relation between Law and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth Century</span> (1905). This work was based on lectures Dicey delivered in 1898 at the Harvard law school. Dicey had visited the United States previously, in 1870, when he befriended such notable Americans as E. L. Godkin, Charles William Eliot, and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. In <span class="italic">Law and Opinion</span> Dicey divided public opinion into the following categories: old toryism (1800&#150;30), Benthamism or individualism (1825&#150;70), and collectivism (1865&#150;1900). As a map of the interaction between law and public opinion Dicey's effort lost the confidence of later historians, and his artificial classifications appeared to sacrifice analysis to symmetry of expression. Of Dicey's three great works, <span class="italic">Law and Opinion</span> suffered the greatest loss of influence in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Dicey also possessed a keen interest in contemporary politics, and until the 1880s he embraced orthodox Liberalism with an emphasis on the benefits of free trade. The conversion of William Gladstone to home rule for Ireland turned Dicey into a leading polemicist on Liberal Unionism. Preservation of the union with Ireland became the core of his political creed, and in this cause he published <span class="italic">England's Case Against Home Rule</span> (1886), <span class="italic">Letters on Unionist Delusions</span> (1887), <span class="italic">A Leap in the Dark</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">A Fool's Paradise</span> (1913). Fears for the Irish union caused him to work tirelessly, by publication and private letter, in opposition to any scheme that would modify Ireland's constitutional status. In part because of his own enunciation of parliamentary sovereignty as a fundamental principle of the constitution, and in part from his reading of federalism in the United States, Dicey rejected federalism in any guise as a solution to the revision of Ireland's constitutional status. Dicey opposed a federal settlement because he believed that it produced an inherently weak form of government that repudiated centuries of historical development. Towards the end of his life his hopes were dashed by the events in Ireland from 1918 to 1921.<br>
<br>Dicey was a gifted conversationalist who sometimes fell prey to the habit of explaining at length any topic with which he was acquainted. Tall and thin, with a splendid white beard in later life, Dicey was for decades a familiar figure in the Oxford University community. Personal generosity of spirit did not extend to politics, where proponents of views contrary to his own drew fierce criticism. He was eighty-five when he published his last book, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Union between England and Scotland</span> (1920), with Robert Sangster Rait. Dicey died peacefully of respiratory complications on 7 April 1922, at his home, The Orchard, 80 Banbury Road, Oxford, after a life full of academic distinction and honours. He was buried at St Sepulchre's cemetery, Oxford. His wife, Elinor, died the following year. Dicey was remembered as an individual who sought the national good above all else, and his work continued to influence discussions of constitutional law. His ability to present the complexities of constitutional law to the public has endured since his death, and it will likely remain his greatest achievement.<br>
