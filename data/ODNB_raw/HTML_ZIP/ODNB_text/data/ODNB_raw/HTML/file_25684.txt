<span class="headword">Skinner,  Robert</span>  (1591&#150;1670), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was born on 10 February 1591 and baptized two days later at St Sepulchre, Northampton, the second son of the vicar, Edmund Skinner (<i>c</i>.1554&#150;1628), and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1630), daughter of Humphrey Radcliffe of Warwickshire. On 6 August 1594 Edmund was instituted rector of Pitsford, also in Northamptonshire, where he spent the remainder of his ministry and where the younger of his seven sons and four daughters were baptized. Robert attended Brixworth grammar school before matriculating on 11 July 1606 as a scholar from Trinity College, Oxford. He graduated BA in June 1610, became a fellow in 1613, proceeded MA on 25 June 1614, and subsequently acted as vice-president of the college under its energetic president, Ralph Kettell. A younger near contemporary was Gilbert Sheldon, the future archbishop; among his own students were the future traveller Henry Blount, the Commonwealth judge Richard Newdigate, and William Laud's godson William Chillingworth.<br>
<br>Having proceeded BD on 19 April 1621 and been licensed to preach on 14 January 1622, probably about this time, and certainly by 1624, Skinner became lecturer at St Gregory by St Paul's, London. During this period he resigned his fellowship and married Elizabeth (1603&#150;1644), eldest daughter of Bernard Banger (<i>d</i>. 1615), late esquire bedell of divinity at Oxford; their eldest son, Matthew, was baptized at St Benet Paul's Wharf on 11 April 1624. Following the death of his father on 21 May 1628 Skinner was the next day instituted as rector of Pitsford, but this did not signal a move into provincial obscurity. Probably on the recommendation of Laud, recently translated to the see of London, on 8 January 1629 Skinner became a royal chaplain-extraordinary, and on 31 October a chaplain-in-ordinary. On 16 July he wrote to the bishop reporting on a visit to Oxford to attend the annual act in terms revealing of their intimacy and their shared perspective on university and ecclesiastical affairs. Dismissing the degree disputations as &#145;many Arguments about unnecessary Quaestiones, but not a peece of an Answere to any Argument&#146;, his scorn was directed especially at notable Calvinist participants and preachers. While he considered that Mr Williamson allowed an excessive freedom to claim the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in the interpretation of prophecy so dangerously attractive to sectaries that &#145;I doubt not but weavers &amp; shoemakers will challenge the Spirit as much as any&#146;, it was regius professor John Prideaux who drew his heaviest fire. Prideaux &#145;read of the use which Reason hath in points of Divinity &hellip; very slackly and very tediously, to litle purpose&#146;, inventing an enemy in the papists when they were well able to out-argue the Church of England on the point. Later in the proceedings, in criticizing the performance of the up-and-coming young Laudian Thomas Lawrence, Prideaux &#145;publiquely [professed] himself an Adversary at once of the authority of the Church and of the Demeans thereof&#146;. To Skinner's evident satisfaction Lawrence's performance earned resounding applause; to Skinner's evident delight his glancing tilt at Bishop John Jewel's reputation provoked Prideaux into &#145;a rage (for I must tell you, it was a meer rage)&#146; and a betrayal of Calvinist feelings of helplessness at the triumph of Laudianism at court  (LPL, MS 943, fol. 133).<br>
<br>From 24 January 1631 Skinner was also rector of Launton, Oxfordshire, and thus well placed to continue in the role of informant to Laud on university affairs. His own position is clear from his preaching at Whitehall. Too many &#145;early green heads ingage themselves in preremptorie opinions, in the parlour, in the pulpitt, in the presse, without preparation or provision beside their own thoughts&#146;, he observed in his earliest recorded sermon on 6 December 1631  (BL, Add. MS 20065, fol. 22). His was not just a negative distaste for unregulated controversy, however, but a positive preference for Arminianism. As he put it three weeks later, condemning the &#145;impious and prodigious errors [that] are crept into the church&#146; in the form of absolute predestination as &#145;a dangerous position; which at once abolisheth the free grace of God to man, and our due thankfulness to God&#146; while &#145;we rightly conclude we are elected by grace because we are freely elected&#146;  (ibid., fol. 4). &#145;Seditious opinions, and turbulent positions have beene ever first invented and vented in private&#146;, he proclaimed in <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the King</span> (1634). The remedy was public worship undertaken with proper demeanour in a sacred and beautiful place. &#145;It is not complete worship, without a clear Demonstration of our subjection, without genuflection, or prostration, or some other inclination of the body&#146;  (p. 6). The sacraments were to be approached with due reverence, and the very meanings which puritans feared might be read into the prayer book communion service were affirmed as orthodox: &#145;is it not deepe infidelitie and heresie, to thinke Christ to bee absent from his Body and Blood? Most certainely present he is, though not by his glorious, yet in a singular way, by his gracious presence&#146;  (pp. 22&#150;3). The many benefactors who had contributed to the rebuilding fund for St Paul's Cathedral and thus to the removal of &#145;the abhomination of desolation&#146;  (p. 36) from the temple in Israel, earned his approbation; the largest clerical donation to the project came appropriately from Skinner himself.<br>
<br>Promotion was not long in coming. Early in 1636 Skinner resigned Pitsford. In July he was elected bishop of Bristol, on 13 August he was created DD, and on 17 November the king presented him to the rectory of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire. Consecrated bishop on 15 January 1637 he was enthroned by proxy on 13 February. By the previous October he had already made a careful assessment of episcopal revenues, and both his immediate predecessors, George Coke (translated to Hereford) and Robert Wright (now at Coventry and Lichfield), were called to account for missing income and alienated rights. In his letters to Archbishop Laud explaining this and his dealings with Dean Edward Chetwynd and the chapter of Bristol, he was characteristically confident and robust in promoting the endowment of cathedral and diocese. His visitation articles and his speech accompanying the visitation at Dorchester, Dorset, on 18 September 1637, published the same year as <span class="italic">The Speech of Dr Robert Skinner</span>, echoed his court sermons in their concern not just for peace and conformity but also for fitting ceremonial and consolatory sacrament. Baptism and the eucharist were not &#145;mere signs&#146;  (p. 20); the clergy were to bring their parishioners to confession and &#145;fit them for Absolution; for Absolution, I say, wherein is the Life and Soul of all the comforts of the Soul&#146;  (p. 22); scripture, oath of allegiance, reason, custom, and charity bound observance of kneeling, of the cross in baptism, and of church vestments.<br>
<br>With the calling of convocation in 1640 Skinner emerged as a prominent member of its upper house. He was delegated with Matthew Wren to consult with the lord chief justice over the legal implications of the proposed ecclesiastical canons, and with Wren, Walter Curle, and Joseph Hall to consult with the representatives of the House of Commons over the &#145;etcetera oath&#146;; before the end of September he had introduced it in his own diocese. In April 1641 he was among members of the Lords who met at the bishop of Lincoln's lodging and condemned the doctrinal content of recent publications. Preaching at court on 1 August a sermon much corrected in the surviving copy, his attention turned to the sight of &#145;greevous wolves [who had] entered in not sparing the flock, when they cannot but behold ungratious children devouring their owne mother that bear them&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 20065, fol. 122). Following a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> of 11 November that year and royal assent on 29 November he was translated to the bishopric of Oxford, also adding nearby Cuddesdon to his livings. Less than three weeks later, on 17 December, he subscribed to the protest of bishops prevented from attendance at the House of Lords and as a result was committed to the Tower, where he spent eighteen weeks before being released on bail.<br>
<br>The nature and extent of Skinner's episcopal ministry over the next two decades is not entirely clear. On 10 June 1642 his daughter Bridget was baptized at Cuddesdon, and it is possible that he spent time in Oxford once the king made the city his headquarters that autumn; his wife died there on 25 June 1644, according to Anthony Wood within a fortnight of her eighteenth confinement. Skinner was sequestered from Greens Norton on 22 July 1643 for his malignancy, and by 13 June 1646 had suffered the same fate at Cuddesdon, although that summer he and his son Thomas put up a fight, allegedly molesting and obstructing his successor. He kept Launton, despite the Lords' attempt to admit T. South on 17 July 1646, and that December he petitioned to compound. A fire at his house had by this time destroyed the parish register there, and with it any record of his previous residence, but Launton seems to have been his base thereafter. With Ralph Brownrigg alone among the bishops to have been granted a licence, he later claimed to Sheldon that &#145;for preaching I never failed one Sunday for 15 years together&#146;  (Skinner, 10). His ordinations of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1699/', "Ralph Bathurst")</script> on 2 March 1644 and of John Martin and others at Trinity College chapel on 21 December 1645 were among the first of many secret ordinations in Oxford and Launton. On his own perhaps inflated reckoning over the 1640s and 1650s these totalled between four and five hundred &#145;and not one of them all but subscribed to the Articles, and took the oath of allegiance in those days when, upon discovery, I should have had my books, and my bed taken from me, having little else left me&#146;. He recalled that Thomas Lamplugh, vicar of Charlton-on-Otmoor, &#145;in those dismall dayes rid not fewer than 300 journeys betwixt Oxford and Launton&#146; to help him with confirmation and ordination  (Skinner, 9&#150;10); Bathurst assisted under cover of his medical practice. Skinner also later told Sheldon that where he could he had attempted to control what was heard by congregations:<blockquote>I took such care for all Scrip[tures] that were commanded to be read in churches, that constantly every clause that tended to the dishonour of the king or church, was branded aforehand with black lead, and this, by my direction, many did, whom I durst to trust. (Skinner, 9&#150;10)</blockquote>Assessment of Skinner's contribution to the survival of prayer book Anglicanism still depends largely on his own claims, but there is some independent evidence that his judgement and authority were recognized at the time. On 4 August 1647 Sheldon, at that point a royal chaplain and perhaps writing at the king's behest, sought Skinner's opinion on &#145;whether, upon extreme necessity or any exigence of state&#146; a Christian monarch might lawfully tolerate the exercise of more than one religion within his kingdom. Three days later, his experiences doubtless having taught him to temper with pragmatism his previous conformist idealism, Skinner replied that since Charles was indeed standing under &#145;extreme necessity&#146;, such a course was &#145;not only lawful, but expedient&#146;  (Skinner, 7). Characteristically, he added a reminder of a previous request to put before the king his claim to the reversion of the headship of Gloucester Hall, part of the original endowment of the bishopric, but now all the more necessary after his financial misfortunes. However, over the years such apparent acquisitiveness, together with his inexplicable liberty of preaching, convinced Secretary of State Edward Hyde and others that Skinner had not been as energetic in the underground church as he might have been and that his main goal was his future translation to a richer see. Hyde said as much in a letter to John Barwick of 26 September 1659, and his disapprobation was subsequently considered to be the chief obstacle to Skinner's gaining any swift reward for his labours.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Skinner regained his livings, and according to White Kennett immediately ordained over a hundred clergy at Westminster Abbey. On 31 July 1660 he was named to a commission of visitors of the University of Oxford, and in concert with others locally began a brisk purge of both university and diocese. Alert as ever to the augmentation of church revenues, this time in relation to Shotover Forest, he also had the foresight to arrange in the summer of 1662 ordinations in anticipation of the vacancies likely to result once the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> came into force on 24 August. Yet he still felt the need to defend his interregnum record in the letter to Sheldon of 17 August, pleading that poverty in the form of debt incurred even before he went to Bristol had tied his hands from doing more. Eventually his deserts or his hints were accepted: on 12 October 1663 he was elected bishop of Worcester, being enthroned by proxy on 20 November.<br>
<br>From Worcester, Skinner retained his close links with Trinity College, of which Bathurst was now president, taking a critical and influential interest in building work and giving generous donations to the library and a new quadrangle. In the mid-1660s he was also in confident form dealing with routine diocesan business and reporting to Sheldon on a dispute over the cathedral organ, but thirty years after he had first become a bishop his age may have been telling. Little evidence survives of his episcopate, and on 28 October 1669 a letter to Secretary of State Joseph Williamson gave erroneous news of his death. Yet when he drew up his will on 2 April 1670 his opinions were as vigorous as ever: he expressed himself &#145;a true sone of the Church of England&#146; which &#145;is a true member of the holy Catholique Church&#146;; he had &#145;ever embraced the liturgie and service of the Church now in use as one of the greatest blessings the heir of Grace ever bestowed upon us of this nation&#146; and implored &#145;our Lord Jesus Christ lover and author of peace to move all animosities and wilfull opposicons against that most excellent peece of divine service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/333, sig. 94). On 7 June, Thomas Lamplugh, having commented favourably to Williamson on the loyalty of Worcester itself, where the mayor was &#145;active and courageous in suppressing conventicles and seditious meetings&#146;, wrote that the bishop was &#145;ill with an issue, but may linger some time, as nature is strong&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 259). Seven days later Skinner died, and was buried in his cathedral. He left four sons and four married daughters.<br>
