<span class="headword">Brude mac Bile</span> <span class="st"> [Bridei son of Beli]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 693), <span class="occ">king of Picts</span>, was overking of the Picts from 672 until his death. Irish annals call him &#145;king of Fortriu&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.193) and his mother presumably belonged to the royal matrilineage of that Pictish province (roughly the southern half of modern Perthshire). Ecgfrith (<i>d</i>. 685), king of Northumbria, was said to have been his cousin (<i>fratruelis</i>), and it seems that Ecgfrith's uncle, King Eanfrith, may have been the maternal grandfather of Brude's mother; not, as is sometimes supposed, her father [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49277/', "Picts, kings of the")</script>]. Brude's father is stated to have been a king of Ail Cluathe (&#145;Rock of Clyde&#146;, present-day Dumbarton). There are two kings called Beli in the Strathclyde royal genealogy (Bile seems to have been the Pictish form of the British Beli, adopted into Irish); to identify either Beli as Brude's father is possible, but strains the chronological evidence to its limits.<br>
<br>Brude succeeded in the Pictish kingship to Drust, Donuel's son, who had been expelled in 672 after an abortive revolt against Ecgfrith (the Picts had been subject to Northumbria since the 650s) ended in the slaughter of the Pictish army. In 682 Brude is said to have &#145;destroyed&#146; the Orkney Islands and between 680 and 683 the annals record several &#145;sieges&#146; within what might well have been Brude's sphere of interest, though he is not named in connection with any of them.<br>
<br>In 685 King Ecgfrith, apparently without provocation, invaded the country of the Picts. A Pictish force, by a series of deceptive withdrawals, led the Northumbrians on beyond the rivers Earn and Tay, and on Saturday 20 May inflicted a heavy defeat upon them in swampy ground at Nechtansmere, or Dunnichen Moss, near Forfar. Ecgfrith himself died. An Irish verse says that Brude was fighting for &#145;the heritage of his grandfather&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.194). It has been suggested that his maternal grandfather may have been the king of, or a nobleman in, the province of C&iacute;rchenn (modern Angus and Mearns). A further possibility is that the grandfather was Donuel, the father of Gartnait and Drust, Brude's immediate predecessors. Brude could thus provide an example of a nephew succeeding to his maternal uncle(s) in a matrilineal society; however, other explanations of his ancestry have been put forward. As a result of the Pictish victory (or perhaps, rather, of Ecgfrith's death), the Picts were free thenceforward from Anglian dominion and occupation.<br>
<br>Brude died in 693 and was believed to have been buried in Iona. He was remembered partly for having freed his kingdom from Northumbria, and partly for having been a friend of Adomn&aacute;n, the ninth abbot of Iona, who died in 704. A story in an Irish homiletic life of St Adomn&aacute;n tells of his distress when Brude's body was brought to the island for burial.<br>
