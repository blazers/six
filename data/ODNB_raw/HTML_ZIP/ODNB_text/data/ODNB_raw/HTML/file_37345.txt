<span class="headword">Davis,  George Edward</span>  (1850&#150;1907), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born at Eton on 27 July 1850, the eldest son in the family of three sons and two daughters of George Davis, bookseller, and his wife, Lucy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith). Little is known of his early education and at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a local bookbinder. However, after two years he abandoned this trade to pursue his interest in chemistry. He went to work at the local gasworks and studied part time&#151;initially at the Slough Mechanics' Institute and later (for one year) at the Royal School of Mines. He was a great believer in practical experience and to this end, at the age of nineteen, went to Manchester, then one of the main centres of the British chemical industry. He worked as a chemist at Brearley &amp; Sons where he stayed for three years. In early 1872 he was engaged as manager at the Lichfield Chemical Company in Staffordshire, where his initiative and inventiveness were given full rein by an indulgent proprietor. Davis planned and built a number of new chemical plants, designing both the equipment and the buildings in which it was installed. Thus he became a largely self-taught engineer; his works included the (then) tallest chimney in the UK, with a height of more than 200 ft. He also appreciated the value of economics applied to industry and, in his early writings, was clearly concerned with the costs of materials and products. This concern was reflected at a personal level when, in his letters to his parents, he remarked that he was considering getting married in order to save money and live comfortably.<br>
<br>Davis's years in Lichfield appear to have been a fruitful period professionally. He was contributing papers to scientific journals and also engaged in debate with other industrial scientists, whose work on certain engineering projects he regarded as sadly inadequate. His only complaint (in nearly every letter he wrote) was of the dullness of his existence outside work. He obviously missed the opportunities provided by a big city and journeyed to Manchester as frequently as he was able on business trips. Ultimately his increasing frustration at Lichfield led him about 1875 to return to the north-west, to work at the St Helens factory of J. G. Gamble, pioneers in the Weldon chlorine process.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1878 Davis married Laura Frances Miller (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), daughter of Charles Miller, tailor; they had at least one son. Earlier in the same year he had entered private practice, but by the time of his marriage had been recruited into the new chemical inspectorate by its first director, Angus Smith. Davis visited many chemical works, and inspected their arrangements for pollution control. The visits led him to realize that any chemical process could be considered as a sequence of particular operations, the fundamental concept behind the modern field of chemical engineering. Although he did not coin the term &#145;unit operations&#146; his writings show an awareness of the concept. He argued that all processes could be broken down into a relatively small number of operations which, when studied in the abstract, revealed certain general principles which were applicable to any process.<br>
<br>In 1884 Davis returned to private practice, this time in partnership with his brother Alfred. Although their business as bleach manufacturers was not successful, the consulting business flourished. In addition, Davis continued to develop his ideas on chemical engineering. In 1887 he founded the <span class="italic">Chemical Trade Journal</span> which, in addition to encouraging and spreading commercial and technical information, also served to publicize Davis's own ideas on chemical engineering. He developed these ideas sufficiently to present a series of lectures at Manchester Technical College in 1887. These were published in the <span class="italic">Chemical Trade Journal</span> and became the basis of the <span class="italic">Handbook of Chemical Engineering</span>, published in 1901. In his introduction to the latter, Davis outlines his philosophy, that &#145;Chemical Engineering deals with the construction of plants &hellip; for the utilization of chemical reactions on the large scale without in any way specifying the industry in which such plants are to be used&#146;. This was a revolutionary idea, and it was not widely accepted in the UK until after the Second World War. However, in America it was exploited with great commercial success in the early 1900s.<br>
<br>Davis was for some years the leader of a group of chemists and engineers who met together under the title of the Faraday Club. From this little group sprang the Society of Chemical Industry in 1881; Davis was a founder member and its first honorary secretary (1881&#150;3). He subsequently set up a Manchester section of the society and was its chairman from 1895 to 1898.<br>
<br>Davis was a short, stout, bearded man with a dry sense of humour. He once said:<blockquote>Never be in too much of a hurry to give answers to a client. If you are too quick he will think the problem easy and worth little. If you make a mistake he will not be pleased. In any case, you will make plenty of mistakes without being overhasty. (Swindin, <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, 30)</blockquote>His many interests included microscopy and, feeling the lack of any journal on the subject, he founded the <span class="italic">Northern Microscopist</span> in 1881. He also wrote a book, <span class="italic">Practical Microscopy</span>, published the same year. He had sixty-seven patents granted, and in addition to his books published numerous scientific papers and prosecuted a successful consultancy business. He was widely considered the father of chemical engineering. He died at his home, 151 Croxted Road, West Dulwich, on 20 April 1907.<br>
