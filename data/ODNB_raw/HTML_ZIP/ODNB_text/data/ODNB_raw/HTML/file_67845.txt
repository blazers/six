<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woodhouse,  Violet Kate Eglinton  Gordon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Violet Kate Eglinton Gwynne]</span>  (1871&#150;1948), <span class="occ">keyboard player</span>, was born on 23 April 1871 at 97 Harley Street, St Marylebone, London, the second daughter and fourth of seven children of James Eglinton Anderson Gwynne (1832&#150;1915), engineer, inventor, and landowner, and his wife, Mary Earle (1841&#150;1923), known as May, daughter of William and Cornelia Purvis. Violet's musical gifts were inherited from her mother's side of the family. Her mother, herself a fine singer and an intimate of the great soprano Adelina Patti, fostered her prodigious talent from childhood. By sixteen she was among the most promising pupils of the country's leading piano teacher, the German &eacute;migr&eacute; Oscar Beringer.<br>
<br>Violet was determined to be a full-time musician. Her authoritarian father was equally determined that she should not be a professional. The solution was a husband with the means to indulge her ambition. Her engagement in 1893 to Lord Gage, a rich Sussex neighbour, was, however, broken off after her mother explained the facts of life to her. Two years later Violet married John Gordon Woodhouse (1870&#150;1951), the shy heir to Sicilian Marsala estates. It was mutually understood that the marriage would be childless, if by no means loveless.<br>
<br>Dissatisfied with the narrow range of the conventional turn-of-the-century repertory, Violet was fascinated by the lecture-recitals of Arnold Dolmetsch, whose early music revival was beginning to gain critical attention. Under Dolmetsch's guidance she gradually transferred her affections to the harpsichord and clavichord. Another important influence on her at this time was the Spanish cellist Agust&iacute;n Rubio, an inspirational teacher and one of the many &eacute;migr&eacute;s who contributed to London's importance as a cosmopolitan musical capital.<br>
<br>In 1899 the Hon. William Reginald Shute Barrington (1873&#150;1960) fell in love with Violet and went to live with her and Gordon. Barrington was the love of Violet's life, although it was never clear how far their relationship was consummated. In 1933 Bill, as he was known, succeeded his father, becoming tenth Viscount Barrington. A gentle and handsome man, he was completely uninterested in music, but had a watercolourist's eye and created three beautiful gardens for her. As the reputation of her musical salon grew, so also did her reputation for unorthodox&#151;some said scandalous&#151;living. In 1901 the Hon. Denis Tollemache (1884&#150;1942), soldier and musician, and Maxwell Labouch&egrave;re (1871&#150;1918), known as Max, barrister, wit, and intellectual, joined the household, creating a surprisingly harmonious <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; cinq</i>.<br>
<br>Nor was it men alone who were drawn to Violet. Her dark looks (attributable to her grandmother's secret descent from an Indonesian rani), her vivacity and natural intelligence, her resolution and generosity of spirit, allied with her artistic genius, attracted the devotion, sometimes the infatuation, of many women, including the composer Dame Ethel Smyth, the music critic Christabel Marshall, and the novelist Radclyffe Hall.<br>
<br>The shock of the First World War destroyed Violet's idyll. All her men except Gordon, who was unfit, went to the front. Barrington contracted dysentery in Mesopotamia. Tollemache was twice wounded and was later captured after being listed missing presumed dead. Labouch&egrave;re was fatally wounded in 1918. Both Tollemache and Labouch&egrave;re won decorations for valour.<br>
<br>The aftermath of war left Gordon financially diminished, and Violet was now obliged to turn professional. In 1923 she became the first performer to record (for HMV) on the harpsichord. In 1926, however, the finances of the household took an extraordinary turn for the better when Gordon's two spinster sisters were simultaneously murdered by their butler. They had intended to leave their fortune to a cousin, but their wills were unsigned. As next of kin, Gordon was the sole inheritor. With her independence thus restored, Violet reverted to playing in her own salon, an ambience perfectly suited to early music and her chosen instruments. For the remainder of her life, with the rarest exceptions, she played to private audiences at Nether Lypiatt Manor, her beautiful Carolean ch&acirc;teau above Stroud, in Gloucestershire. A period of mellow happiness was broken by the outbreak of the Second World War, in which Violet, with her love of German culture and her painful earlier memories of war, found herself quite unable to share in popular patriotic sentiments. Tollemache died in 1942. Violet died at 11 Mount Street, Mayfair, London, on 9 January 1948 and was buried in Folkington churchyard, Folkington, Sussex, on 14 January. Gordon Woodhouse and Barrington continued to live at Nether Lypiatt until their own deaths, in 1951 and 1960 respectively.<br>
<br>Originally known as a pianist, Violet became the foremost clavichord player of her day and, with Wanda Landowska, the foremost harpsichordist. On these instruments contemporary reviewers ranked her with Pablo Casals on the cello, Lionel Tertis on the viola, and Andr&eacute;s Segovia on the guitar. Her magnetism evoked comparison to the powers of a magician. In the words of her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, &#145;the subtlety of her playing was infinite and her clarity perfection &hellip; when she began to play, one became &hellip; entangled in a golden web of purest sound&#146;  (Douglas-Home, 306).<br>
<br>Perfectionist, scholarly, and a mistress of stylish showmanship, Violet cast her spell over the most discerning observers, including Bernard Shaw, Frederick Delius, Ralph Vaughan Williams, the Sitwells, and the music critic K. S. Sorabji. Among the admiring visitors to her salon were Lawrence of Arabia, T. S. Eliot, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Pablo Picasso, Serge Diaghilev, Auguste Rodin, and the cream of Europe's musicians.<br>
<br>The most important part of Violet's legacy was her role in the revival of pre-Romantic music, especially of early music played on appropriate instruments. She shared with Sacheverell Sitwell credit for rediscovering Domenico Scarlatti and made extensive use of the Fitzwilliam virginal book (containing music by William Byrd, John Bull, and Giles Farnaby), a source then almost unknown to the music-going public, although recognized by scholars as representing the genesis of modern European keyboard music.<br>
<br>In 1996 most of Violet's extant recordings were collected into a CD under the Pearl imprint. In his foreword Richard Luckett noted her &#145;scrupulous fidelity to the texts&#146;, adding that she played Scarlatti straight at a time when Wanda Landowska was adding, subtracting, and modifying &#145;almost as though he was in competition with Stravinsky&#146;. Luckett contrasted Landowska's &#145;metronomic&#146; playing with Violet's &#145;no less virtuosic, but infinitely more relaxed&#146; style. An unusual feature of her playing was her use of the accelerando, with the result that &#145;her <i>rubato</i> effects are produced by a return to the initial tempo, rather than by slowing it&#151;at odds with modern performance practice but historically justifiable&#146;.<br>
<br>Some of the works that Violet admired were not deemed commercial propositions for recording. But perhaps the biggest loss to posterity is that wartime restrictions on materials prevented her from fulfilling her plan to record the whole of Bach's <span class="italic">Das wohltemperierte Klavier</span>.<br>
