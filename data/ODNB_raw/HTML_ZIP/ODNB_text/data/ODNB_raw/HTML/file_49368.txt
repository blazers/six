<span class="headword">Acland,  Sarah Angelina <span class="st"> [Angie]</span></span>  (1849&#150;1930), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at Broad Street, Oxford, on 26 June 1849, the second of eight children and only daughter of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62/', "Henry Wentworth Acland (1815&#150;1900)")</script>, who was then Lee's reader in anatomy at Christ Church, Oxford, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cotton (1815&#150;1878). In 1856 &#145;Angie&#146; and her brothers became the second group of children in Oxford to be photographed by Lewis Carroll, after Alice Pleasance Liddell and her sisters, daughters of H. G. Liddell, dean of Christ Church, who were the Acland siblings' closest childhood friends. For the first fifty-two years of her life she lived in her parental home, 39&#150;41 Broad Street, Oxford, before moving, in May 1901, after her father's death, to a large villa, Clevedon House, in Park Town, north Oxford.<br>
<br>From October 1862 Acland was educated with two female cousins in the schoolroom of the house of her uncle Thomas Dyke Acland, eleventh baronet, on the Killerton estate in Devon. In April 1866, she transferred to Mayfield, a girls' boarding school in Southgate, north London, popular with the daughters of Oxford academics. After she left Mayfield in July 1867 her health declined, and she sought treatment for two seasons in the spa town of Wildbad in the Black Forest, and spent a succession of winters on the French riviera. She returned to Oxford permanently shortly before the death of her mother in 1878, in order to take over the running of her father's busy house. However, she retained the status of an invalid for life, lameness in one leg requiring her to use a walking stick and confining her to a &#145;rollstuhl&#146; (wheelchair) for periods.<br>
<br>Acland's love of art was encouraged by her father, who was a patron of the Pre-Raphaelites. Her formal artistic education began in June 1864 under the Oxford art master William Riviere. At Mayfield she was taught by the watercolourist David Hall McKewan. After leaving Mayfield she joined the recently founded Oxford School of Art, studying with Alexander Macdonald, who became a lifelong friend. In November 1870 she began taking private lessons from John Ruskin, who lodged with the Aclands during his first two years as Slade professor of art at Oxford. During Ruskin's time in the house the Aclands were visited by Julia Margaret Cameron. Angie Acland witnessed the famous altercation between photographer and critic in her parents' drawing room: &#145;Mrs. Cameron thumped his poor frail back exclaiming &#147;John Ruskin you are not worthy of photographs!&#148;&#146;  (Devon RO, 1148m/7/1, 52). Acland developed a close personal attachment to Ruskin, referring to him as her &#145;Cricket&#146;, he calling her his &#145;Teaze&#146;. After he moved to rooms in Corpus Christi College she continued to act as his &#145;secretary&#146; of sorts  (Ruskin to Acland, undated, Bodl. Oxf., MS Acland d. 170, fols. 51&#150;2), dealing with correspondence from his other &#145;girl friends&#146;  (Ruskin to Acland, 11 Aug 1875, Bodl. Oxf., MS Acland d. 170, fols. 155&#150;6), and undertaking paid artistic commissions, such as colouring plates for his publications and copying drawings for his lectures. The relationship came to an end after Ruskin's final split with the university in 1885, but they continued in correspondence until 1888.<br>
<br>Acland's decision to take up photography was prompted by the gift from her father of a Kodak no. 3 camera for her birthday in 1891. Her first photographs were taken at Beechwood House, the New Forest home of her friends Helena Mary (Ellie) Heathcote and Beatrice Henrietta (Be) Heathcote, daughters of Sir William Heathcote, fifth baronet. The following summer she purchased a Watson &amp; Sons Acme: a high-quality half-plate field camera, with which over the next ten years she explored a variety of different monochrome genres, from domestic interiors, through figure studies and landscapes, to copywork.<br>
<br>The genre in which Acland first achieved public success was portraiture. She photographed William Ewart Gladstone and his wife on 25 October 1892, during the prime minister's visit to Oxford to deliver the Romanes lecture. Her programme of portraiture was facilitated by access to the eminent men and women who visited her Broad Street home, including Lord Salisbury and Lord Kelvin. Her portraits of Ruskin, taken at Brantwood, Coniston, on 1 August 1893, were widely reproduced. She joined the Oxford Camera Club as the first woman member in June 1894, and made her debut as public speaker at the club when she gave a lecture entitled &#145;Home Portraiture&#146; in February 1899. That year she exhibited for the first time at the annual exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), showing lantern slides of four portraits, which led to her election to the society on 11 December 1899.<br>
<br>Acland's lasting contribution to the progress of photographic history was her work in colour. In 1899 she turned to the problem of orthochromatic photography: the correct representation of the relative brightness of different colours in a monochrome photograph. In 1899 and 1900 she conducted a series of experiments into the capabilities of the &#145;Spectrum Plate&#146; of the manufacturer James William Thomas Cadett. Beginning in 1900 she became the first amateur to make a successful study of the capabilities of colour photography proper.<br>
<br>The colour photographs that brought her international attention were made with the process of Edward Sanger Shepherd, in which three separate exposures were taken through red, green, and blue filters, before being recombined as cyan, magenta, and yellow prints. Her earliest datable Sanger Shepherd separation negative was exposed in June or July 1900, but not exhibited at the Camera Club until March 1901, due to the death of her father in autumn 1900. At the RPS annual exhibition in autumn 1901 she exhibited six colour lantern slides, mostly of still life subjects, and from 1902 to 1904 several colour prints on paper. Her most admired colour photographs were lantern slides from negatives taken in 1903 and 1904 during visits to Gibraltar, where her brother Willie was admiral superintendent of the dockyard. They include views of the Rock and North Africa, studies of the vibrant flora, and portraits of the residents. Her complete collection of Gibraltar slides was shown during a lecture at the Camera Club in December 1904 and at the RPS in June 1905. The latter was regarded as ground-breaking, marking as it did the definite assumption of &#145;three-colour work as a process for the travelling amateur&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photography</span>, 13 July 1905, 548). The enthusiastic reception of her slides prompted the RPS to invite her to show them again during a series of &#145;Lantern lectures&#146; later in 1905, and as the first of the 1906 lecture series. She was elected a fellow of the RPS on 1 February 1905.<br>
<br>Acland tested the French Lumi&egrave;re Autochrome plates as soon as they became available in England in September 1907. She submitted a portrait of her goddaughter to the inaugural exhibition of the Society of Colour Photographers later in the month, in what is the earliest Autochrome by a woman known to have been exhibited in public. Autochrome photography, which she carried out with a Sinclair &#145;Una&#146; field camera, would soon supplant the Sanger Shepherd process as her main specialism. Most of her photographs with the new plates were taken on the island of Madeira, where she overwintered for six months every year from 1908 to 1915. In Madeira she also experimented with other &#145;screen plate&#146; colour processes, including the Omnicolore, Dufay Dioptichrome, and Paget Colour processes. After 1913 she preferred the Paget process for most purposes, whether seascapes of Funchal Bay, studies of flowers in the quinta gardens, or telephoto views of the mountains.<br>
<br>Acland was active in charitable work, through raising funds for a cabmen's shelter in Broad Street, Oxford, and organizing the collection of &#145;comforts&#146; for soldiers in the South African War. For many years she was secretary of the Acland Home for nurses, founded in memory of her mother. Gardening was also a keen interest, as in later life were astronomy and meteorology: in 1916 she was elected a fellow of the Meteorological Society on the strength of sunshine records she kept in Funchal.<br>
<br>Acland's time in Madeira was brought to an end by the First World War, while the strain of the war also led her to give up most of her photography. Shortly before her death she consolidated her life's work by compiling several presentation albums of portraits annotated with reminiscences of her sitters, and preparing a photographically illustrated manuscript memoir. She died at her home, Clevedon House, on 2 December 1930, and after a service at Christ Church Cathedral was buried in Holywell cemetery, Oxford. She left her plates, both monochrome and colour, to her photographic collaborator, James Henry Minn (1870&#150;1961). On Minn's death the majority went to the Bodleian Library, before the colour examples were transferred to the Museum of the History of Science in 1988.<br>
<br>Acland has attracted attention from historians as an example of a dutiful unmarried daughter of the Victorian period, who sacrificed herself to the service of her parents and their home (Jalland, 260&#150;62; Peterson, 18). Her significance in the history of photography lies in her successful use of the Sanger Shepherd process before the release of the Autochrome in 1907. Despite the subsequent success of the Autochrome, her reputation was such that in 1936 the authority on the history of colour, Henry Oscar Klein, could still write that &#145;the colour transparencies of Miss Acland, done with the Sanger-Shepherd process, have never been surpassed in brilliancy and truthfulness of colour, and only Technicolor of to-day can approach them&#146;  (H. O. Klein, &#145;Colour Photography of To-day&#146;, <span class="italic">British Journal Photographic Almanac</span>, 1936, 173).<br>
