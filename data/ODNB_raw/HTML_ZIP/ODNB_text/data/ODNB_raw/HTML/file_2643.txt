<span class="headword">Blewitt,  Jonas</span>  (1757&#150;1805), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 9 September 1757 in Virginia Street, in the parish of St George-in-the-East, Middlesex, the son of John Blewitt, mariner, and his wife, Mary. He was baptized at the church of St George-in-the-East on 3 October. He was almost blind. In 1769 he was apprenticed to the Lambeth organist William Godfrey, and he also studied with Samuel Jarvis, organist of St Sepulchre, Holborn. He was appointed organist of St Katharine Coleman, Fenchurch Street, about November 1777, and about April 1783 he also became organist of the united parish of St Margaret Pattens and St Gabriel Fenchurch, holding both posts until his death. By 1780 Blewitt was composer to Spa Gardens, Bermondsey, and he also wrote music for Vauxhall Gardens, the Apollo Gardens, Astley's Amphitheatre, Covent Garden Theatre, the Lyceum, and the Royal Circus; he may have played the organ at these places. In the autumn of 1793 he played at the revival of the Eidophusikon at the Great Room, Spring Gardens, accompanying readings at the piano and playing the organ while panoramic scenes were displayed.<br>
<br>Blewitt's <span class="italic">Six Songs and a Cantata</span>, op. 1, was published about 1778, and <span class="italic">A Collection of Favourite Ballads</span>, op. 3, about 1785; other songs were issued individually. All his other published music was for the organ: two sets of <span class="italic">Ten Voluntaries</span> (op. 2, <i>c</i>.1780, and op. 5, 1796), <span class="italic">Twelve Easy and Familiar Movements</span>, op. 6 (<i>c</i>.1797), and <span class="italic">A Complete Treatise on the Organ</span>, op. 4 (1794?). The treatise is his most significant work, as it is one of the first English organ tutors and provides invaluable details of eighteenth-century performance practice; a &#145;Set of Explanatory Voluntaries&#146; was appended. The work gives his address as Grange Road, Bermondsey, but Doane's <span class="italic">Musical Directory</span> for 1794 gives his address as Bermondsey Square. The <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was probably written a few years earlier, as the organist John Worgan (<i>d</i>. 1790) is described in it as &#145;now living&#146;. Blewitt's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2644/', "Jonathan Blewitt (1782&#150;1853)")</script> became a prominent musician, and Jonas's daughter Mary Ann Blewitt (<i>b</i>. 1784) succeeded her father as organist of St Katharine Coleman. C. Blewitt, singer at Spa Gardens (1785&#150;8), may also have been related. Blewitt's death was reported on 10 April 1805. According to James Brown's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Musicians</span> (1886) he was a noted organist &#145;famed for his powerful and effective style&#146;  (Brown).<br>
