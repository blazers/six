<span class="headword">Payne,  Peter</span> <span class="st"> [Peter Engliss]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1455/6?), <span class="occ">Wycliffite and Hussite heretic</span>, was born at Hough on the Hill, near Grantham, Lincolnshire. According to Thomas Gascoigne (<i>d</i>. 1458), he was the son of a Frenchman and his English wife. He is referred to variously in the sources as Clerk or Freyng, and in Bohemia often as Engliss (Engli&#353;).<h2>
<a name="AcademiccareerinEngland"></a>Academic career in England</h2>Peter Payne was first induced to read John Wyclif's books at Oxford, where he started to study shortly before 1400, by his fellow student Peter Partridge (<i>d</i>. 1451), later chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral and Payne's adversary at the Council of Basel. Partridge, in turn, claimed that Wycliffite ideas reached the notorious Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417) through Payne, an assertion supported independently by Robert Holbech, Oldcastle's excommunicated chaplain. Thomas Netter (<i>d</i>. 1430) later claimed that Payne, the most outspoken Wycliffite at Oxford, had once cried off from an arranged public debate with himself about pilgrimages, the eucharist, and mendicancy. Payne had become MA by 5 October 1406. At that time he managed somehow to have the university seal affixed to a letter affirming that Wyclif was upright of life, outstanding in his exposition of scripture, and never condemned for heresy. Gascoigne was to claim later that Payne simply stole and misused the seal, so as to persuade the dissidents in Bohemia that all England, with the exception of mendicant friars, held the same beliefs as they did in Prague. This possibility cannot be excluded; at any rate, Payne met two Bohemian scholars, Mikul&aacute;&#353; Faulfi&#353; and Ji&#345;&iacute; of Kn&iacute;nice, who returned home with the letter in 1407. It was published in Prague in early January 1409 by Master Jeron&yacute;m Pra&#382;sk&yacute;, whom Payne may have met in England. There are also good reasons to assume that Payne acted as intermediary in the correspondence between Jan Hus, Richard Wyche, and Sir John Oldcastle between 1408 and 1413.<br>
<br>From 1408 Payne rented White Hall, Oxford, for 28<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. p.a. In 1428 the imprisoned Lollard Ralph Mungyn attested that, although Payne propagated Wyclif's ideas at Oxford, London, and elsewhere, he evaded official investigation for a long time. Indeed, he even managed to succeed the excommunicated Lollard William Taylor as principal of St Edmund Hall next door as late as 1410. There is a strong probability that either he or Taylor wrote the extensive treatise (in English, despite its title) <span class="italic">Tractatus de oblacione iugis sacrificii</span>  (BL, MS Cotton Titus D.v). On the other hand, he had nothing to do with another text, <span class="italic">De versione Bibliorum</span>  (Vienna, &Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, MS 244). Payne was summoned before a commission dealing with persistent Wycliffites in the university in autumn 1410. Archbishop Thomas Arundel of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1414) showed some benevolence and accepted him as orthodox on 6 November. Belatedly Payne may have been ordained by Bishop Robert Hallum of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1417) as subdeacon and deacon in February and April 1412. His tenure of the White Hall was terminated against his will in October 1412, but he still paid his rent of 30<i>s</i>. for St Edmund Hall for that year. However, shortly afterwards&#151;in August 1413 at latest&#151;when Oldcastle was arrested, Payne left both Oxford and England, probably to avoid prosecution.<h2>
<a name="InHussitePrague"></a>In Hussite Prague</h2>Before Payne finally settled in Bohemia, his travels took him first to the Rhineland and to Deutach in Alsace where a young Waldensian emissary, Friedrich Reiser, met him in the house of his father, Conrad. Though sources about Payne's stays in Germany and perhaps also in Switzerland are unreliable, they do show a web of close connections between nonconformist in religion and mostly undercover centres across much of Europe. It was hardly a coincidence that Payne reappeared in Germany in 1418 or 1419, living in the house of a Nuremberg merchant named Hans von Plauen. Payne did not meet Jan Hus, head of the Bohemian reform movement, personally. This suggests that he arrived in Prague only after Hus's fateful departure for the Council of Constance, that is, after 11 October 1414. Payne aroused the interest of Prague reform circles by his very first known intervention in Bohemia, when he demanded reception of the eucharist by the laity <i>sub utraque specie</i> (that is, the receiving of both bread and wine), as against the Catholic practice of withholding the chalice. He is likely to have written this polemic against the priest Havl&iacute;k, Hus's successor in the Bethlehem Chapel, in February 1415  (Krm&iacute;&#269;kov&aacute;, 148&#150;64). He took part in current debates in the university with a series of minor contributions such as his treatises against oath taking, <span class="italic">De iuramento</span>  (Barto&#353;, <span class="italic">Liter&aacute;rn&iacute; &#269;innost</span>, 96, no. 2), and on Wyclif's orthodox veneration of images, <span class="italic">De ymaginibus</span>  (Nechutov&aacute;, 326&#150;33); his defence of predestination, <span class="italic">Tractatus de predestinacione</span>; and perhaps also by his assertion of the inevitability of all that happened in this world, <span class="italic">De necessitate absoluta evenientium</span>. Payne's rejection of oath taking is close to the position of Lollards and Waldensians, and he does not differ substantially from mainstream reform opinion on other questions. The delay of his registration as a master of arts at Prague until 13 February 1417 may have been caused, among other reasons, by the fact that his main Prague contacts were with German nonconformists around Nikolaus von Dresden of the Black Rose Hall. His appointment as examiner in the winter semester of 1417 may have prompted him to compose a mnemonic device for his students, the so-called <span class="italic">Dicta</span>  (Barto&#353;, <span class="italic">Liter&aacute;rn&iacute; &#269;innost</span>, 98, no. 6).<br>
<br>Payne returned from a visit to Nuremberg just in time to witness the stormy onset of the Hussite revolution in Prague. His opponents had assumed that he was still abroad, but when Master Mikul&aacute;&#353; Stoj&#269;&iacute; made a public attack upon his defence of Wyclif's realist philosophy, Payne surprised him by announcing a date when he would stand up for that position. The confrontation, arranged for late April 1420  (Sedl&aacute;k, &#145;Drobn&eacute; texty&#146;, 114&#150;15) failed to take place, because Prague had to face the threat of the first Catholic crusade against Bohemian revolt. The authority of Payne, as an English Wycliffite and defender of utraquism (that is, of the administration of the eucharist in both kinds, bread and wine), was now so great that the city of Prague chose him as one of its ambassadors to King Sigismund (<i>r</i>. 1419&#150;37) at the beginning of May 1420. Any optimism was dashed by the ultimatum delivered to them at Kutn&aacute; Hora (Kuttenberg). Nevertheless, a path to talks with orthodox Catholic theologians was then opened by the victory of Hussite troops over the crusaders on 14 July 1420. Payne is very likely to have participated, but first he appeared in what would be his future role as a go-between and impartial adviser on 5 August 1420, when he deliberated with the representatives of the Old Town of Prague over the twelve articles submitted as an ultimatum by the radical Hussite Tabor brotherhood. Evidently he performed well as a diplomat, for the towns of Prague nominated him in the embassy that was to offer the crown of Bohemia to King W&#322;adys&#322;aw of Poland. On his return Payne found himself in agreement with the leading Hussite theologian, Jakoubek of St&#345;&iacute;bro, when both presented arguments against a radical Prague preacher, John &#381;elivsk&yacute;, in a congregation held in the Caroline College on 11 November 1421. Three days later Payne was elected to the Hussite consistory in Prague, in which he may have remained active until 1434.<br>
<br>Payne is then out of sight for more than a year, until his reappearance as an adviser to the lay arbiters in controversies between Prague and Tabor clergy at Konopi&#353;t&#283; Castle in June 1423. It is doubtful whether he did then contribute, as has been suggested, the two polemical treatises, <span class="italic">De corpore Christi</span>, defending the eucharist theology of the Taborites against his Prague colleague, Jan of P&#345;&iacute;bram  (Sedl&aacute;k, <span class="italic">T&aacute;borsk&eacute; trakt&aacute;ty</span>, 21&#150;7), but he may, by his text, <span class="italic">Tripes</span>, have defended three of Wyclif's theses on the eucharist against P&#345;&iacute;bram. The assumption that Payne went for a second time to Poland as an envoy from Prague in March 1424 is unfounded; he has been confused, as on other occasions, with Mat&#283;j of Hn&aacute;tnice, also nicknamed &#145;Engliss&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1425&#150;6 the Prague Hussite alliance had to cede primacy of power to the radical brotherhoods of the Taborites in southern Bohemia and the &#145;Sirotci&#146; (&#145;Orphans&#146;) in eastern Bohemia. Payne remained in Prague, but he faced opposition from conservative masters, and especially from Jan of P&#345;&iacute;bram, who launched a wholesale attack on the Wycliffite foundations of Hussite doctrine in 1426. P&#345;&iacute;bram decided to play the nationalist card against Payne, with whom he disputed at Christmas 1426 and again during Lent from 5 March 1427. He and his partisans denigrated Payne for his English origin, a position also reflected in a contemporary verse-composition in which the Devil lets Payne slip into Bohemia, taking from his homeland &#145;rights unwholesome for the Czechs&#146;. Wyclif's undoubtedly awkward theology of the eucharist, one that many Hussites rejected outright, surfaced time and again in the polemics, and even Payne, in his brief <span class="italic">Confessio</span> of April 1427, preferred not to take an unequivocal stance. However, not long afterwards a popular rebellion purged Prague of all university conservatives, including P&#345;&iacute;bram.<h2>
<a name="Intheserviceofutraquism"></a>In the service of utraquism</h2>In August 1427 the retreat of a crusader army under the papal legate, Cardinal Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447), from the west Bohemian castle of Tachov undermined the position of the local Catholic alliance, which agreed to hold a debate involving clergy from both sides. With Beaufort's consent the Catholics nominated Master &#352;imon of Ti&#353;nov, while the Hussite position was to be defended by Payne. The disputation began at &#381;ebr&aacute;k Castle on 29 December 1427, but swiftly collapsed for lack of agreement over rules of engagement. It was to be almost a year before those advocating a peaceful solution to the Bohemian crisis prevailed at King Sigismund's court, and then only because he faced war on two fronts. For the negotiations that followed Payne was elected principal speaker of the Hussite delegation, possibly at the diet at &#268;esk&yacute;-Brod on 1 January 1429, notwithstanding the widely differing attitudes of some leaders in the Hussite alliance. The choice of Payne was a recognition not only of his abilities, but also of his prudent occupation of a place between the moderate and radical Hussite theologians.<br>
<br>After a minor clash the official meeting between the delegation and Sigismund was rescheduled from Moravsk&yacute;-Krumlov to Bratislava, and opened on 5 April 1429 with speeches by Sigismund and Prokop Hol&yacute; (&#145;Prokop the Shaven&#146;), the head of the Bohemian embassy. Then came Payne's turn. He argued that the Hussites' struggle was against all tyrants and for the sake of the law of God, not for their own glory. Very little was required to end the conflict; it all depended on Sigismund. If he could but see his way towards changing his policy, he would receive that most famous kingdom of Bohemia, setting free the truth, and would secure the allegiance of both the communities of Prague and of Bohemia  (<span class="italic">Petri Payne</span>, 88). But all too soon the talks fell into deadlock over the problem of establishing arbitration in the conflict concerning the Hussites' four articles&#151;administration of communion in both kinds; free preaching of God's word; ecclesiastical abandonment of secular property; abolition of public mortal sins. Attempts to make progress were blocked by powerful hardline groups on each side. Even a second meeting with Sigismund at Bratislava in July failed to achieve any significant results.<br>
<br>Payne is unlikely to have taken part in this second phase of talks because he was needed for the diets and other proceedings in Prague. Master Jan Rokycana, successor to Jakoubek of St&#345;&iacute;bro (<i>d</i>. 1429), sought to reconcile his university colleagues who had been forced out of Prague two years before. Jan of P&#345;&iacute;bram, who had returned home, renewed his assault on the ideas of Wyclif and his chief local adherent, Payne. An intense and highly sensitive disputation between the two lasting several days in September and October 1429 was attended by large numbers of the public. In their verdict on 20 October the eight referees ordered both masters to submit their arguments in writing, stop denigrating each other, and hold their fire until 4 June 1430. Payne duly produced the texts of both his disputations  (Barto&#353;, <span class="italic">Liter&aacute;rn&iacute; &#269;innost</span>, 103&#150;4, nos. 13, 14); P&#345;&iacute;bram refused and left Prague once more.<br>
<br>At the end of December 1429 Payne is recorded as participating in business concerning the Caroline College in Prague, where he had become one of the masters, with a prebend in the collegiate chapel of All Saints&#151;a position he may well have secured much earlier. Between 1432 and 1434, however, he was living in the Slavonic abbey called Emmaus in the New Town, perhaps because of discord within the college. Payne, like P&#345;&iacute;bram, felt the need to prepare his polemics carefully, just as he later prepared for his public debates with the theologians of the Council of Basel. With three or possibly even more assistants he completed a list and index of all Wyclif's writings by 1432 or 1433 at the very latest. This enabled the compilation of thematically specific anthologies, facilitating the work of scholars down to the present day.<br>
<br>The Wycliffite Peter Engliss was rated highly by the Taborites and so, at their instigation, the Hussite diet at the beginning of 1431 elected Payne to take part in a new embassy to the Polish king. Negotiations opened at the royal castle of Wawel on 19 March, but failed as a result of the irreconcilable theological positions of the two sides. As soon as the embassy returned, a major Hussite synod assembled in the Caroline College on 30 April 1431 to try to harmonize the conflicting positions of the Prague and Taborite clergy before the forthcoming negotiations with envoys from Basel. This purpose was not achieved, but one consequence of the synod was to give a spur to the doctrinal merging of east Bohemian and Prague Hussitism. Payne himself drew closer to the centrist group of the utraquist consistory in Prague.<h2>
<a name="AttheCouncilofBasel"></a>At the Council of Basel</h2>Hopes for swift reconciliation between Hussite Bohemia, the Catholic church, and King Sigismund blossomed after the failure of a fourth crusade against the Hussites in August 1431. At the end of September the Council of Basel agreed to a public hearing for a Hussite embassy, and sent its official invitation to Prague on 15 October. The provincial diet met in February 1432, agreed to accept, and nominated a large delegation for preliminary talks at Cheb (Eger). Although Payne was among the Prague clergy chosen, the young and vigorous Master Jan Rokycana was clearly establishing himself among the Hussite leaders. As well as pronouncing upon matters of protocol, the Cheb provisions declared that the law of God, the practice of the early church, and the doctrines of the church fathers were to be the impartial &#145;judge&#146; over the imminent talks. (Payne, at least, would come to show his trust in these criteria as agreed.) A diet at Kutn&aacute; Hora in August and September selected the embassy to Basel; Payne was of course among the representatives of Prague and its university.<br>
<br>The council's speakers had been marshalling their arguments for some time, whereas their Bohemian opponents looked more for a simple victory for holy truths. It is not clear whether the defendants of each of the four articles were actually selected at the Kutn&aacute; Hora diet or perhaps shortly afterwards. But, whatever the arrangements, quarrels broke out as soon as the Bohemian embassy reached Basel. This did not directly affect Payne himself, to whom the defence of the fourth article, concerning poverty of the clergy, seems to have been assigned back in Prague. Payne made his first public appearance as a speaker for the Hussite delegation on 13 January 1433, when he demanded in vain the transfer of the debate into the cathedral, and the public announcement of dates for each individual presentation. Payne spoke quite often thereafter, both on behalf of the embassy and for himself. Contemporary witnesses attest to the lively response aroused by his ironic and sarcastic formulations, though a number of the council's participants claimed to have difficulties with his English pronunciation of Latin.<br>
<br>Payne's turn to defend his assigned article came on the morning of 26 January 1433  (<span class="italic">Petri Payne</span>, 1&#150;40). After only a few introductory words he submitted an unequivocal formulation. Both human and divine law, and the precepts of the fathers (who deployed actual examples from the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>), prohibited Christ's true clergy from holding any secular possessions or worldly power. Putting forward four premises, Payne defined the notions of &#145;possession&#146;, &#145;domination&#146;, &#145;law&#146;, and &#145;clergy&#146;, quoting numerous extracts from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments and from the fathers, in evidence. The next morning, the 27th, Payne continued with more extracts from the fathers and from more recent theologians. In the final part of his speech, on the morning of Wednesday 28 January, he buttressed his interpretation by recourse both to resolutions by early church councils and to the <span class="italic">Decretum Gratiani</span>. In conclusion Payne summarized his arguments, criticizing the charges against Wyclif and Hus, and asked those present to agree to the worldly disendowment of the church in the interest of all. None the less, in the course of a subsequent debate within the Bohemian delegation, Payne yielded to strong pressure and accepted a compromise demanding only the divestment of superfluous possessions, and that only from clergy individually culpable. A paragraph on the evangelical poverty of the early church, which he added to his original text in its written version of 4 February 1433, thus acquired the character of a hardly enforceable moral appeal.<br>
<br>The whole of February was taken up by the responses of the council's speakers, with only brief respite. Payne followed them all intently and interjected frequent comments, attacks and questions on behalf of himself and his remaining friends. His own designated opponent, Juan Palomar, archdeacon of Barcelona and papal auditor, began his reply on 23 February and tried to turn Payne's own weapon, biblical citation, against him. A rumour also spread through Basel the following day that an English embassy, which had just arrived, had brought with it accusations by the crown against Payne. This threat may have been nullified by the council's safe conducts to the leaders of the Bohemian delegation; when Palomar resumed his reply to Payne on 27 and 28 February, he assumed a perceptibly more civil attitude towards him.<br>
<br>March was reserved for the counter-replies of the Bohemian advocates. The planned departure of the embassy induced some cardinals and bishops to offer these Hussite theologians incorporation into the council. The latter chose Payne to discuss the offer, but on 12 March as the climax to an embittered confrontation he declared why it was unacceptable. Returning to his formal task, in his replication to Palomar (31 March &#150; 1 April) Payne refuted his opponent's objections painstakingly and step by step. However, with rumours against him still circulating, he asked Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini for an opportunity to defend himself publicly before the whole council. He was allowed to do so three days later, but was then accused formally both of heresy and of treason against Henry VI by John Keninghale (<i>d</i>. 1451), the Carmelite provincial of England, and Peter Partridge, chancellor of Lincoln and his sometime friend. Payne denied the charges calmly, and was defended strongly by others of the Bohemian embassy. The two English envoys made their accusations again on the following day, 7 April, just as Palomar was about to respond to Payne's theological refutation. None the less, the disputation went on, hotly debated, until 9 April, Palomar conceded elements of truth in his opponent's arguments but yielded nothing in his final rejection of Payne's reasoning. The council was still very eager to keep the Bohemians at Basel, but the delegates refused all blandishments and set off for home on 14 April.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalyears"></a>The final years</h2>Payne naturally assumed a major role in continuing negotiations with the council, both at Prague and Basel. Besides other tasks Payne had to ask the councillors of the New Town of Prague on 27 May 1433 to suppress any activities offensive to the council's envoys, while during the June diet of the same year he was among a group of authoritative Hussite theologians including Rokycana and a Taborite bishop, Mikul&aacute;&#353; of Pelh&#345;imov, who held learned debates with the embassy. In the diet of November and December that year he even had to face threats from conservative Prague masters, and the Caroline College witnessed such uproar that the provincial governor had to summon armed guards. In a session on 18 November Payne called in vain for unity, for on another occasion he was to denounce the council's envoys openly, claiming that they would really prefer to throw all Hussite clergy of any sort into a sack. In its efforts to subvert the Hussite movement the council now received crucial assistance from the former's right wing, which, in alliance with the Catholic nobility, defeated the troops of the radical Hussite unions in the battle of Lipany on 30 May 1434. According to a later report Payne himself was captured; certainly, if no more reliably, rumours of his death or imprisonment soon circulated as far away as London. If he was imprisoned, it cannot have been for long, because at the end of October 1434 a provincial diet nominated him as sole referee in debates between Prague and the Taborite clergy.<br>
<br>Here Payne faced a dilemma. At heart he undoubtedly wanted the embryonic Taborite church to retain its Wycliffite character. On the other hand, he surely realized that the only way out of crisis was through the unity of the whole calixtine party, so called from its demand for access to the chalice&#151;<i>calix</i>&#151;at the eucharist. Small wonder, then, that he kept postponing his arbitration. He had moved some time earlier to the town of &#381;atec (Saaz) in western Bohemia, from where he visited Prague for official business. Not even in &#381;atec, however, could he escape the attentions of conservative forces, now gathering strength as they sought to restore the old order. King Sigismund dared not deliver him to the Council of Basel but he did try to bring him and the Taborite radical V&aacute;clav Koranda to submit fully to the rule of the church. Payne refused on 15 April 1437 at the Caroline College, whereupon Bishop Philibert of Coutances pronounced him the source of all errors in Bohemia, and Sigismund (soon to die) expelled him formally as a foreigner from all his lands. Payne's long-standing clerk and companion, John Penning, was arrested a week later and interrogated on the 28th.<br>
<br>It is not known where Payne sought refuge before his return to the colony of German and other nonconformists in &#381;atec. It may have been in one of the towns of the Taborite union, perhaps Klatovy. It was among people from there that he was arrested by a Catholic noble, Burian of Gut&#353;tejn, in October 1438. A search of his personal possessions uncovered material concerning negotiations with Poland, which may indicate that Payne was now engaged in a campaign against Sigismund's successor as king of Bohemia, Albrecht II of Habsburg. Burian hoped for a very substantial reward from England for this capture, but Henry VI wanted to transfer any cost to the papacy, as his secretary, Bishop Thomas Beckington, informed Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47) on 18 May 1440. Oxford University, asked for its opinion by the king, sent a message of praise to Burian but assured him that the English crown had no intention of paying a ransom. Thus disappointed, Burian changed course completely, and later in 1440 accepted 12,000 Bohemian groschen from the Taborite towns for Payne's release from Rab&#353;tejn Castle.<br>
<br>In the early 1440s Payne challenged his old foe, Jan of P&#345;&iacute;bram, in a treatise in which he took up again the question of the eucharist. P&#345;&iacute;bram came back at him as strongly as ever, complaining to the burgesses of &#381;atec of Payne's persistent adherence to errors of doctrine, and offering a wager of 6000 groschen on a disputation with him at any Christian university, or, failing that, at Prague before the masters and the land diet. In fact it was P&#345;&iacute;bram himself who evaded a disputation with Payne in the course of a synod at Kutn&aacute; Hora in July 1443, perhaps because it had elected Payne, together with Master V&aacute;clav of Dr&aacute;chov, as its president and correspondent to the general synod that followed. The Taborites took Payne's side, protesting against P&#345;&iacute;bram's slurs and, later on, accused him of having deliberately spoken in Bohemian during the Prague synod of January 1444 so that Payne could not understand him. By a historic irony, the final verdict of the provincial court of justice, against the creed of the Taborite clergy, on 31 January 1444, relied heavily upon Payne's own assessments of 1427 and 1436.<br>
<br>Nothing further is heard of Payne for a full eight years. Although it is tempting to identify him with the &#145;Constantinus Anglicus&#146; who was in Constantinople as an ambassador of the utraquist consistory in 1451, there is no convincing evidence. His last public appearance in his adopted homeland was in September 1452, when he had to pronounce a judgment against Taborite doctrines for a third time. Yet when the fortress at Tabor capitulated to the provincial governor, Ji&#345;&iacute; of Pod&#283;brady, on 1 September 1452, one of its conditions was that Ji&#345;&iacute; should recognize as a religious authority a special commission of which Payne was a member. Now an old man, Payne may indeed have ended his days as an adviser to the calixtine archbishop, Jan Rokycana. A rather unconvincing report dates his death to 1455 or 1456; he is presumed to have died in Prague.<br>
<br>Master Peter Payne was among those nonconformist scholars of the later middle ages who strove to achieve tangible reforms in the practices of the church and of lay religion. From his student days in Oxford he stood firm to the doctrines of John Wyclif and spent his life in promoting and defending them in both his homelands. In Hussite Bohemia he offered himself many times over the years both as a brave and respected arbitrator in the severe doctrinal disputes within the domestic streams of reform, and also as an impressive envoy to the Catholic world and an advocate of those four articles of Prague that tried to bridge the internal chasms. His literary bequest, though relatively slim, is an honest reflection of the often dangerous life of this dedicated intellectual reformer; his defence at Basel of the Wycliffite and Hussite stance on clerical poverty is no mean epitaph.<br>
