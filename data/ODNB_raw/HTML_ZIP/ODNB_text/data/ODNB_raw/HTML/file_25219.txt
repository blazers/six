<span class="headword">Sharp,  Samuel</span>  (1814&#150;1882), <span class="occ">geologist and antiquary</span>, was born on 18 July 1814 at Romsey, Hampshire, the son of Stephen Sharp (<i>bap</i>. 1791) and his wife, Anna Maria Bloor (<i>bap</i>. 1784), formerly of Uppingham. His father died while he was a child and his mother married the proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Stamford Mercury</span>. Samuel, after schooling at Southsea, moved to Stamford, where he assisted in managing and editing the newspaper. He had an early interest in astronomy and chemistry but took up geology after attending a lecture at Stamford by George Fleming Richardson (1796&#150;1848) in 1842. Together with John Morris (1810&#150;1866), Sharp studied the geology of the local area, making use of sections newly exposed by railway construction.<br>
<br>In 1846 Sharp married Caroline Ann Weldon and in 1857 they moved to Dallington Hall, near Northampton, where Caroline Sharp soon opened a new girls' boarding-school. Here Sharp's geological collecting continued, aided by the superintendent at the extensive open-cast Ironstone mine at Duston. As might be expected from someone connected with a school, Sharp gave constant assistance to naturalists of the younger generation in Northamptonshire. He also &#145;laboured energetically to found a good provincial museum&#146; in Northampton, placing there from 1869, &#145;valuable contributions from his own large geological and antiquarian collections&#146;  (Judd 1883, 72). Over 1500 of his fossils were purchased by the British Museum in 1876; they included examples of a number of fossil species named after him. The residue of his collection went to Mason College, Birmingham. Sharp was fellow of the Geological Society from 1862 and published important papers on the oolites of Northamptonshire in 1870 and 1873, and on an uninformed search for coal near Northampton in 1871. His text book <span class="italic">Rudiments of Geology</span> followed in 1875 (2nd edn, 1876).<br>
<br>Sharp was also active as an antiquary. Long a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, Sharp published papers on architecture and local history, as well as one against cruelty to animals. A member of the Numismatic Society, Sharp also formed an unrivalled collection of the productions of the Stamford mint, on which he published in 1869 and 1880. He died on 28 January 1882 at his home, Great Harrowden Hall, near Wellingborough. The fossil brachiopod <i>Kallirhynchia sharpi</i>, named after him in 1938, now marks the long-distance Jurassic way footpath through both his adopted counties.<br>
