<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robinson,  George Frederick Samuel</span>, first marquess of Ripon  (1827&#150;1909), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 October 1827 at 10 Downing Street, London. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23836/', "Frederick John Robinson")</script> (1782&#150;1859; Viscount Goderich, 1827; earl of Ripon, 1833), was the second son of the second Baron Grantham. Goderich's elder brother, Thomas Philip Robinson, had inherited the Grantham title and before his death in 1859 had added the earldom of de Grey, which was later inherited by his nephew, George. At the time of George's birth Goderich was the distracted prime minister of a strife-ridden and short-lived administration during the autumn and winter of 1827&#150;8. George's mother, Lady Sarah Albinia Louisa (1793&#150;1867), was the daughter of Robert Hobart, fourth earl of Buckinghamshire. She was in poor health and fearful for her new baby, as she had already lost a son, who had lived only two days, and she was still grieving her daughter's childhood death a year before George's birth. The anxieties of both parents for their new son and heir added to Goderich's political problems and hastened the demise of his government.<h2>
<a name="Childhood"></a>Childhood</h2>George remained an only child, much cosseted by his pious mother but introduced at a very early age to the political issues of the day by his father. George attended neither school nor university, but was educated at home in the Lincolnshire countryside at the family home at Nocton. He imbibed a love of the countryside and developed a lifelong interest in entomology. He was described as &#145;an active, well grown and noisy boy&#146; by his father in 1830. George took wholeheartedly to country pursuits, which remained a source of relaxation for him throughout his long life. He became a fine shot, though late in his life according to a beater (who told the story to the present writer) he killed a chicken by mistake while on a shoot with his son and jestfully threatened a similar fate for the beater if he revealed the truth. George learned to read by copying his father's letters, and his mother imparted to him her strict evangelical beliefs. Apart from the fact that he became a voracious reader little is known of his formal instruction. His home life was conventional enough and it remains something of a puzzle why he entered early manhood with extremely radical ideas. The high-mindedness, idealism, and deep Christian faith which characterized his whole public life are no doubt the consequence of the religious training acquired at his mother's knee. Though in the years to come he was to have profound political disagreements with his father, his mother remained a major religious guide and influence. Her death in 1867 was one of the major factors in inducing what would now be called a mid-life crisis, which ended with his conversion to Catholicism.<br>
<br>In the course of his life George enjoyed a number of titles. From 1853 to 1859 he was known as Viscount Goderich, a courtesy title he took on the elevation of his father to the earldom of Ripon. In 1859 he succeeded both to his father's earldom and to the more senior one, that of his uncle de Grey, by which he was known until he was elevated to a marquessate in 1871, when he chose the Ripon title.<h2>
<a name="Themakingofaradical"></a>The making of a radical</h2>The events of 1848 coincided with George's coming of age and they reinforced his conviction that drastic change was required to solve the political and social ills of Britain. On a visit to the continent in 1849, initially as an attach&eacute; to Sir Henry Ellis's mission to Brussels, arranged by his father, he spent some months in Italy, Switzerland, and France. In Paris he witnessed, and was much impressed by, the operation of the <i>associations ouvri&egrave;res</i>, the co-operative workshops set up in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm early in 1848. On his return home, through the agency of Tom Hughes, he associated himself with the Christian socialists, who were interested in similar experiments. Founded by F. D. Maurice, J. M. Ludlow, and Charles Kingsley, the Christian socialists sought a solution to the &#145;condition of England question&#146; in the application of Christian fellowship to harmonize social relationships. For George the most practical expression of this ideal was the self-governing co-operative workshop which he argued substituted &#145;a free Cooperative organisation of Labour for the present tyrannical Disorganisation&#146;. In 1852 he supported E. V. Neale's attempts to establish associative workshops of engineers in London, having previously aided the Amalgamated Society of Engineers with money and in print during the lock-out of the newly formed union in the previous winter. In 1850 he had joined other Christian socialists in organizing nine existing self-governing, profit-sharing workshops, and set about encouraging the establishment of others. George believed that nothing short of the moral regeneration of society was called for, and this required substituting the co-operative for the competitive principle in industry and manufacture. Working men had to be regarded as brothers and citizens, and until this was recognized the &#145;terrible evils&#146; of industrial disputation would continue. Similarly he came to support schemes for industrial arbitration as instruments for binding people together. He had also been active promoting schemes for the elementary education of children, but he believed equally in adult education, arguing that &#145;it should be possible for all who had the faculty and desire to profit by it, to obtain the very highest and widest education&#146;. He helped set up the Working Men's College in 1854. He supported it financially and lectured there from time to time on entomology and poetry. Throughout his life Goderich (as he had now become) supported mechanics' institutes and the educational activities of the co-operative movement.<br>
<br>Goderich's most significant work for the Christian socialist movement was a pamphlet he wrote called <span class="italic">The Duty of the Age</span>, in which he attempted to reconcile Christianity with democracy and socialism. He claimed that aristocracies, both of birth and talent, bred &#145;exclusion, division, selfishness&#146;  (quoted in Wolf, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.30&#150;33), and consequently class warfare. Their privileges separated &#145;man from man instead of uniting them&#146; and bred &#145;hatred and revolution, instead of love and peace&#146;. He proposed two basic solutions. Firstly, perceiving the state as a living organism, it should rid itself of the cancerous elements within it which produced class warfare. It had to heal itself by promoting institutions which bound men closer together. The co-operative movement, schemes of industrial arbitration, even trade unions&#151;provided they did not become disruptive elements themselves&#151;tended to further this end. Secondly, he frankly embraced the full implications of democracy, which he said was determined by two factors:<blockquote>First, that every man, so far forth as he is a man, has a claim to share in the government of his country in all its duties, responsibilities, and charges; and secondly that self government is the highest and noblest principle of politics, the safest foundation on which the State can rest. (ibid.)</blockquote>In practical terms self-government involved not only the gradual extension of the franchise to the masses but the obligation on the part of the state to prepare people by education and institutional reform. By this means the &#145;people&#146; could be distinguished from the &#145;mob&#146; and the excesses of 1848 avoided.<br>
<br>This pamphlet, though rejected by Maurice and suppressed by the Christian socialists, is crucial to an understanding of Ripon's later career, for he never deviated from these radical ideals. In 1908 in a speech at a meeting to honour his retirement he said:<blockquote>What has been the guiding principle of my course in public life? I started at a high level of Radicalism in 1852. I was considered to be a very dangerous young man. I am a Radical still, just as much as I was then, but I am afraid that I am much more respectable. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1908)</blockquote>In May 1852 this career began with Robinson's election to parliament as member for Hull. Though ignorant of the corrupt electioneering practices made on his behalf, he was unseated on petition but was returned for Huddersfield the following year. Both this seat, which he held until 1857, and the West Riding, which he served until his elevation to the Lords in 1859, had substantial artisanal electorates. In the meantime he had fallen in love with his cousin Henrietta Anne Theodosia Vyner (1833/4&#150;1907), and their marriage, encouraged by all sides of the family in the expectation that it would curb the outrageous views the young man had come to hold, was celebrated on 8 April 1851 at the house of his uncle de Grey in St James's Square, London. The family were to be disappointed. Henrietta was soon a firm favourite with his Christian socialist friends and loyally supported her husband through his long career, as hostess and a common-sense sounding board. In January 1852 Henrietta was delivered of a boy, who was given the name Frederick Oliver in honour of his Cromwellian ancestry. He was to be the only child of the union.<br>
<br>From 1853 to 1859 Goderich was the leader of a small group of radical politicians in the Commons soon to be known as the Goderichites. He established a reputation as a sound, balanced debater, with a conciliatory tone combined with firm convictions. A political sensitivity, nurtured no doubt by youthful fireside chats with his family at Nocton, and an inherited trait of amiability, which enabled him to see both sides of a question, made him many friends on all sides of the house, so much so that some saw him as a future radical prime minister. In the early 1850s Goderich rejoiced in the lack of firm party lines in parliament which enabled the small group that he gathered around him to exercise an influence out of proportion to its numbers. At the core of the group were the Merthyr Tudful MP, Henry Bruce, and Austen Henry Layard, who represented Aylesbury in the 1850s. They were joined at times by fellow parliamentarians Edward Horsman and Danby Seymour, and by several like-minded men who were not yet in parliament, including Tom Hughes and W. E. Forster. The group met frequently at the Cosmopolitan Club, at dinner and breakfast parties, and in the house, where they plotted the downfall of Palmerston and he planned campaigns to remove the aristocratic stranglehold on public life.<br>
<br>In pursuit of these ends Goderich argued in the Commons for an effective legacy tax on the rich, the removal of the patronage system of church livings, and the extension of limited liability legislation to protect the producer and retail co-operative societies. He supported Charles Dickens's London Administrative Reform Association and planned schemes of industrial arbitration with Bruce. He spoke against the deleterious effects of the truck system as unjust to working folk. Reform in India and of the army figured prominently in the designs of the Goderichites, but it was in the field of civil service reform that Goderich and his friends met with their greatest success.<br>
<br>What they sought was the full implementation of the Northcote&#150;Trevelyan report of 1853, especially the recommendation that open competition replace nomination for entry into the civil service. Their speeches in the house touched raw nerves, and their efforts were rewarded by 1857 when some government departments were recruited by competition. Of course the struggle for full competitive recruitment was not achieved until 1870, but their efforts in the 1850s had helped to break the back of resistance. Goderich's support for civil service reform was based not only on the existing inefficiencies and corruption but rather more on the encouragement open competition would give to education, and the opportunities it provided for the elevation of ordinary folk to share in the government of the country.<br>
<br>By 1859 Goderich was looking for a further extension of the franchise to &#145;the upper portion of the working classes&#146;, as well as a further redistribution of seats from the smaller boroughs to more populous counties like the West Riding and Lancashire. This was fully consistent with the gradualist approach to reform of all kinds that he had espoused since his contact with the political realities of parliamentary life. He always believed, he said, in catching one hare and eating that first before proceeding to catch the next. Goderich served his political apprenticeship in the Commons in the 1850s, but 1859 brought this to an end. In January his father died and he moved to the Lords as earl of Ripon, and in November his uncle de Grey died and he inherited that earldom as well. He now became a man of great wealth, with large estates and influence especially in Lincolnshire and in the West Riding.<h2>
<a name="Reformingminister"></a>Reforming minister</h2>Equally important was de Grey's decision to join Palmerston's government that year as under-secretary of state for war when that statesman took a lurch to the left in forming his new administration. Apart from a brief spell at the India Office in 1861, de Grey held this position until 1863, when he was promoted secretary of state for war and admitted to the privy council. This cabinet post he held until 1866. Not surprisingly de Grey gravitated to the reforming section of that government, and in doing so entered, albeit somewhat reluctantly, Gladstone's orbit.<br>
<br>Now in office de Grey had the opportunity to implement some of his radical ideas, particularly the link he made between democratization and efficiency. Both were singularly absent in the army, and though he laboured under the twin pillars of Palmerstonian indifference and Gladstonian retrenchment some useful reforms were made which paved the way for the more substantial achievements of Cardwell. In the 1850s, like other radicals, he had welcomed the Crimean War against tsarist tyranny, but had deprecated the army's shortcomings in the prosecution of the war, blaming in part the purchase of commissions, the lack of education and professionalism, as well as the administrative structures. In office he was unable to break the power of the duke of Cambridge at the Horse Guards, but he was more successful in the War Office, dividing it into a number of efficient and expert departments. De Grey was, however, more interested in improving the lot of the ordinary soldier, and in this he found an invaluable ally in Florence Nightingale. Barrack conditions, education for soldiers and their children, military prisons, libraries, army hospitals, and the sanitary reform thereof, were all made the subject of inquiry and subsequent action.<br>
<br>De Grey gave unconditional support to the volunteer force, which he intended should become a permanent feature of military organization. The volunteer movement came close to his rather romantic views of a citizen army, which can be attributed to his Cromwellian ancestry, of which he was inordinately proud. He assisted his old Christian socialist friends who raised companies from among the students of the Working Men's College, and was himself an honorary colonel of a Yorkshire regiment. In February 1866, on the elevation of Charles Wood to the Lords, de Grey was moved to fill his post as secretary of state for India, though he continued to speak regularly on army matters and was later an ardent supporter of Cardwell's reforms. This period in high office established de Grey's reputation as an able and efficient administrator committed to reform. In spite of heading one of the great spending departments, he had attached himself to the ever-frugal Gladstone, and in doing so thus brought his unique brand of Christian socialist radicalism to the embyronic Liberal Party.<h2>
<a name="Liberallordpresident"></a>Liberal lord president</h2>On 9 December 1868, at Windsor, de Grey and three other Goderichites&#151;Bruce, Layard, and Forster&#151;were sworn in as members of Gladstone's first administration and that evening they dined together to celebrate. The next five years were to see the accomplishment of many of their dreams of the fifties&#151;the secret ballot, elementary education reform, a measure of justice for Ireland, and the success of the principle of arbitration applied to a thorny international dispute with the Americans. De Grey, as lord president of the council, played a major role in these achievements, mostly by reasoned, firm, but conciliatory debate in the hostile Lords and, in the case of the <i>Alabama</i> negotiations, by his skilful leadership of the British high commission, which concluded a landmark reconciliation with the USA by the treaty of Washington in May 1871. For this he was rewarded with a marquessate, and was known thereafter by the Ripon title. His later support for Irish home rule has its origins in his friendship with Charles Gavan Duffy, which dates from the 1850s, and from his experience in piloting the disestablishment of the Irish church through the Lords. In this matter, his negotiating skills and placatory manner were much in demand, but his firmness of purpose was such that he was instrumental in stiffening even Gladstone's resolve, who thought of dropping the measure in July 1869. Co-operation with Forster, who was vice-president of the council, meant that the two friends had departmental responsibility for the safe passage of the famous landmark elementary education legislation of 1870. Though falling short of de Grey's desire for &#145;compulsion&#146;, it was none the less a tribute to the committee skills and persistence of both men in the face of widespread opposition from many interest groups that it was passed at all. The Goderichites were intimately involved in yet another major Gladstonian reform. Bruce initiated a select committee inquiry into the ballot in 1869, and Forster and Ripon took the lion's share in the parliamentary debates and deserve much of the credit for the passage of the secret ballot, eventually achieved in 1872.<h2>
<a name="ConversiontoCatholicism"></a>Conversion to Catholicism</h2>In August 1873 Ripon resigned from the government, ostensibly on the grounds of an uncharacteristic opposition to a projected extension of the suffrage to the counties. In fact this was more an excuse than the cause of his departure. Ripon had experienced some disillusionment over the influence of nonconformists in the party, especially during their opposition to aspects of the education legislation of 1870, but the underlying reason for the resignation lay in a spiritual crisis which had been gathering momentum for some years.<br>
<br>The death of Ripon's mother, his first and most influential intellectual and religious guide in 1867, was followed by the death of his &#145;prophet&#146; of the 1850s, F. D. Maurice, in 1872. Some measure of the extent of his spiritual anxieties can be gauged from the fact that in 1870, the year he became grandmaster of English freemasons, after twenty full and active years in the craft, he attended his first mass following the assassination of some close relatives at the hands of Greek brigands. An accident to his son, which brought him close to death in 1873, exacerbated and accelerated the crisis. As he grappled with the full implications of a conversion to Catholicism at the height of the crisis over the <span class="roman">Syllabus of Errors</span> and the doctrine of papal infallibility, all his own well-worn and tried political and religious beliefs came into question. The conservative tenets of the church in fact delayed his conversion until he had resolved all the difficulties without sacrificing his liberal values. But this did nothing to diminish the howl of &#145;no popery&#146; protests when the announcement of his reception was made in September 1874. <span class="italic">The Times</span> claimed that he had &#145;renounced his mental and moral freedom&#146;, and when Gladstone in a pamphlet argued that converts placed their &#145;civil loyalty and duty at the mercy of another&#146; Ripon's own first assessment that his conversion would require the sacrifice of his political career appeared justified. A spirited correspondence with Gladstone elicited a concession that Gladstone did not consider that Ripon would be personally short on civil loyalty and duty to his queen and country, and there the matter rested until the furore died down. Manning's advice that &#145;a little while of silence and patience&#146; was required proved correct, to the extent that when Gladstone again came to power in 1880 Ripon was offered and accepted a post requiring maximum &#145;civil loyalty and duty&#146;, that of viceroy of India.<br>
<br>In the meantime Ripon threw himself into the activities of his new co-religionists after a prolonged stay in Italy in the winter and spring of 1875&#150;6. He became a leading figure in the Catholic Union, a member and from 1890 president of the St Vincent de Paul Society, and active in overseas missions and Catholic education concerns at home. Political activity was limited to speeches in the Lords on behalf of Catholic education, and the mid-1870s were devoted to reading, writing, and the domestic pleasures of his two country estates at Nocton and Studley Royal. Two articles published in <span class="italic">The Month</span> in 1879 heralded his return to active politics, and reveal that his radical social gospel and liberal values had survived the intellectual trauma of his conversion. The first of these was &#145;Some thoughts on international morality&#146;, published in February 1879, in which he condemned the immoral statecraft of Napoleon III and Bismarck. In a barely concealed attack on Beaconsfieldism he argued that the Christian nation, while pursuing the highest well-being of the people, should be distinguished &#145;by its scrupulous respect for the rights of its neighbours, and a just consideration of their interests&#146;. A Christian's patriotism, he insisted, was wider than that of the pagan, and to put considerations of policy and force before considerations of right was not only wrong but folly, for &#145;higher wisdom&#146; has it that in the long run material force is the weakest, and that solid foundations can only be laid on &#145;justice alone&#146;. In the light of his subsequent government of India these views are of great importance. The second article, &#145;On cooperation&#146;, returned to his lifelong interest in, and support for, the co-operative movement in all its forms. It arose from a presidential address he had given to the Co-operative Congress in April 1878. Though originally more interested in producer co-operatives, Ripon had long supported the Rochdale model of co-operation as well. In the 1850s he had sponsored legislation to protect all kinds of co-operative activity, culminating in the important part he played in securing the safe passage of the <span class="roman">Industrial and Provident Societies Act</span> of 1862. The presidency of the 1878 congress was a recognition of his support and commitment to the movement. Ripon saw the co-operative movement as a way of breaking down the barriers between labour and capital. It provided moral training, and wherever applied, he wrote, co-operation &#145;tends to bind men together, to give them common instead of conflicting interests&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ViceroyofIndia"></a>Viceroy of India</h2>Ripon was one of the Liberal Party's foremost experts on India long before he became viceroy. In 1861 he had spent seven months as under-secretary of state for India and was largely responsible for the passage of the <span class="roman">India Councils Bill</span> through the Lords. This legislation, introducing non-official members to the governor-general's council, was but the first instalment of a number of conciliatory measures after the mutiny. When Russell reshuffled the cabinet on Palmerston's death, Ripon became secretary of state in this short-lived administration, during which he advanced a scheme for improved sanitary regulations in India in alliance with Florence Nightingale. She complained bitterly, when the government fell, that they had missed the opportunity of establishing a public health service in India by twenty-four hours. Like most advanced radicals before Chamberlain, Ripon disliked imperialism, accepting that ultimately self-government was the end of policy. Meanwhile India, like other imperial responsibilities, should be well governed by instituting political, administrative, and educational reforms to prepare the subject people for self-government. Unlike many Liberals, Ripon also believed in effective social reform as well.<br>
<br>On his arrival in India, Ripon had the difficult task of extricating Britain from the messy problem of Afghanistan by reversing the &#145;forward&#146; policies of his predecessor, Lord Lytton, and by establishing a firm, reliably independent Afghanistan as a better guarantee of Indian security against Russia than any jingoistic theory of &#145;scientific frontiers&#146;. In this he was remarkably successful, in spite of some strong opposition in his council as well as from the India Office at home and the not altogether wholehearted support of the two secretaries of state, Hartington and Kimberley. His policy of peace and conciliation was fully in accord with Gladstone's Midlothian ideals and, of course, his own as expressed in &#145;Some thoughts on international morality&#146;. In fact his success in Afghanistan and his stout-hearted refusal to go to war in Upper Burma on behalf of Rangoon merchants were genuine triumphs for Midlothian principles, in contrast to the sullied policies pursued by Gladstone himself in South Africa in 1881 and in the British occupation of Egypt the following year.<br>
<br>Having cleared the decks Ripon then attempted to do &#145;some little good for India&#146;, as he put it. By 1884 he had established in all provinces, except Bengal, the legislative framework for a network of self-governing local authorities elected by what he said were &#145;the best, most intelligent, and most influential men in the community&#146;. Again there was much opposition, and the results were disappointing, partly because of official hostility but also on account of apathy among many Indians themselves. Ripon's achievement, however, rested less on the tangible results but rather more in reconciling native opinion to continued British rule after Lytton. In social policy India received factory legislation protecting children, and efforts were made to reduce famine and improve elementary education. In Bengal a partially successful attempt to provide tenants with the three &#145;Fs&#146; of Irish reform&#151;fixity of tenure, fair rents, and free sale&#151;met with great opposition and was condemned as &#145;socialistic&#146;. Lytton's press laws, which had muzzled the native press, were substantially repealed and a more liberal administration of the <span class="roman">Arms Act</span> was instituted. Anglo-Indian anger reached unprecedented ferocity in 1883 when Ripon proposed that Indian magistrates and district judges should exercise jurisdiction over European subjects. This was the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span>, discussion and disputation about which raised fundamental questions about the nature of British rule in India. In the end, under pressure from Lord Kimberley and in the face of a virtual mutiny of Europeans in India, a compromise was reached which allowed Europeans trial by jury. But this was not before much damage had been done. The <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> acted as a catalyst both for the formation of Anglo-Indian hostility to a liberally governed India and for the emergence of a political consciousness among native Indians. The speedy and effective organization of Anglo-Indian opposition to the proposed legislation had many lessons for Indians. The Indian Association of Bengal organized its first conference in December 1883 and this became the model for the Congress Movement two years later.<br>
<br>In the face of all this Ripon declared that he was becoming &#145;more radical every day&#146;, and in response to the charge that his policies were unrealistic and indeed sentimental, Ripon prophetically wrote to Forster about his Indian subjects:<blockquote>Unless we provide these men with outlets for their political aspirations they will become most naturally our bitter and very dangerous opponents &hellip; it is our duty to raise the people of this country politically and socially &hellip; making the educated natives the friends instead of the enemies of our rule. (Denholm, 161)</blockquote>But it was not only the educated Indians that he had reached. On leaving India in November 1884 at the end of his term of office he was overwhelmed by the popular expressions of thanks and manifestations of support among ordinary Indians in the streets.<h2>
<a name="HomeruleandtheLiberalParty"></a>Home rule and the Liberal Party</h2>Ripon arrived back in England on 23 January 1885 to a Liberal Party on the point of being torn asunder by the Irish question. Ripon's &#145;advanced&#146; views on Ireland date from his friendship with Charles Gavan Duffy and the campaigns they fought together in the Commons in the early 1850s. His local self-government reforms in India were motivated in part by his fear that India could become another Ireland if the Anglo-Indian community there established themselves as another &#145;ascendancy&#146;. After some months putting his personal affairs in order Ripon invited Sir Charles to Studley Royal in August, resulting in a proposed home-rule constitution with guarantees for the minorities and based on colonial models of which Gavan Duffy had had much experience in Australia. Ripon sent the scheme to Gladstone on 20 January 1886. It is clear that he had worked out an Irish policy similar to that of Gavan Duffy, and this made it easy for him to accept office in the new Gladstone government pledged to inquire into the practicability of establishing an Irish legislature.<br>
<br>Initially sympathetic to Chamberlain's radical &#145;programme&#146;, Ripon remained loyal to Gladstone when the party split, and he campaigned more vigorously than at any time in his life on behalf of home rule. He was sceptical about the round-table conference of 1887 which attempted to heal the breach with Chamberlain and Hartington, exclaiming that he had no desire &#145;to see the Party once more inundated with the cold stream of Whig country gentlemen&#146;. Passionately sympathetic to his co-religionists in Ireland and incensed by the evictions, he worked strenuously to keep the Yorkshire Liberals loyal to Gladstone. In February 1888 Ripon and Morley took the crusade to Dublin itself, where they were enthusiastically received and rewarded with the freedom of the city. In the long years of opposition to come Ripon remained committed to home rule, much more so than many Liberals. He claimed that apart from some issues he had dealt with in India he had never felt so strongly about any public question so much as home rule. He was finally induced to accept Campbell-Bannerman's &#145;step by step&#146; approach of November 1905, but, given the persistent opposition of the House of Lords, there was little choice.<h2>
<a name="SouthernAfricaandtheSouthAfricanWar"></a>Southern Africa and the South African War</h2>Ripon served as first lord of the Admiralty in the short-lived administration of 1886 and as colonial secretary under Gladstone and Rosebery from 1892 to 1895. In the latter period the Colonial Office was preoccupied with the struggle between Rhodes and Kruger in South Africa. Initially Ripon regarded Rhodes as a good Liberal who should be supported, but the conduct of the Matabelele War and the actions of the British South Africa Company led to a growing suspicion of Rhodes. This was reinforced by the Jameson raid and culminated in Ripon's opposition to the South African War.<br>
<br>In 1892 Ripon's policy was based on conditional and wary support for Rhodes, coupled with a conciliatiory attitude to Kruger in the hope of persuading him to become a co-operative and moderate force in the direction of a voluntary union of Dutch and British South Africa. This was probably never very realistic, but after the Jameson raid, and with Chamberlain and Milner in the ascendancy after 1895, it was a lost cause. Though never a simple Little Englander, Ripon opposed the Liberal Imperialists and the South African War. He supported Campbell-Bannerman during the leadership struggle with Rosebery in 1901 and advocated a lenient treatment of the Boer republics at the end of the war.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandresignation"></a>Last years and resignation</h2>In December 1905, at the age of seventy-eight, Ripon accepted the office of lord privy seal and the leadership of the Liberals in the Lords when Campbell-Bannerman formed his government. Small in stature and heavily bearded in later life, he had become something of a pixie-like elder statesman. In spite of bouts of angina he performed his tasks with great vigour and enthusiasm, especially in debates in the Lords where his expertise on Indian, Irish, and educational matters was much respected.<br>
<br>The death of Lady Ripon in February 1907 was a severe blow and accelerated his desire for retirement. An unfailing source of comfort and support, a hostess of great charm and some influence, uniting both Gladstone and Disraeli in their admiration of her, Lady Ripon was a constant helpmate for the fifty-five years of their marriage. Though separated by religious belief they remained devoted to one another.<br>
<br>When Asquith replaced Campbell-Bannerman in April 1908 Ripon stayed on as privy seal but declined to remain leader in the Lords. He finally resigned in October 1908, officially on the grounds of ill health but chiefly on account of the mishandling by the government, and particularly by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33417/', "Herbert Gladstone")</script>, of a Catholic procession through the streets of London.<br>
<br>Honoured by the Eighty Club in November 1908, Ripon claimed that he had pursued radical objectives throughout his career by adopting what he considered to be a &#145;wise and sound principle of public life&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1908), that of taking what he could get and waiting to get more. He last spoke in the Lords on the <span class="roman">India Councils Bill</span> in March 1909. Two days before his death he expressed the view that there was a &#145;fair case for the extension of the franchise to women&#146;. On 9 July 1909 Ripon suffered a heart seizure at his beloved home of Studley Royal and died later that day, an hour before his son arrived. He was buried in St Mary's Church in Studley Park on 14 July, and a requiem mass was sung for him in Westminster Cathedral.<br>
