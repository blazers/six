<span class="headword">Pantin,  Carl Frederick Abel</span>  (1899&#150;1967), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 30 March 1899 at Blackheath, London, the second child and elder son of Herbert Pantin, head of a family manufacturing company, and his wife, Emilie Juanita Abel. She was a descendant of the distinguished Abel family which included Pantin's great-uncle, Sir Frederick A. Abel (1827&#150;1902), the inventor of cordite, and Karl Friedrich Abel (1723&#150;1787), the celebrated viola da gamba player. Pantin's brother W. A. Pantin FBA became keeper of the university archives at Oxford.<br>
<br>From childhood Pantin was fascinated by natural history; at Tonbridge School, Kent (1913&#150;17) he was recognized as having outstanding scientific ability, and in the words of his headmaster, a &#145;nobility of character&#146;. After brief service with the Royal Engineers he went up in 1919 to Christ's College, Cambridge, as a scholar. He graduated with distinction, obtaining first classes in parts one (1921) and two (1922, zoology and comparative anatomy) of the natural sciences tripos, and was awarded the Frank Smart prize in 1922.<br>
<br>Later that year Pantin joined the staff of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth, embarking on a series of elegant and fundamental investigations into the functioning of the lower animals. His work on amoeboid movement contained the elements of the later biophysical approach to the structure of cytoplasm; he investigated the effect of ions on and in tissues and made similarly fundamental discoveries about osmoregulation in flatworms. Pantin believed that physiological mechanism is only meaningful when understood in the context of the biology of the animal in nature; he was one of the first zoologists to employ an ecological, rather than morphological, approach. To this end he would call on his encyclopaedic knowledge of the animal kingdom, backed by a sound knowledge of palaeontology and geology.<br>
<br>While working at the Marine Biological Laboratory Pantin married in 1923 Amy, second daughter of Dr James Cruickshank Smith CBE LittD LLD, a senior chief inspector of schools in Scotland. She was also a zoologist, who qualified in medicine. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1929 Pantin became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, directing studies and lecturing in the department of zoology of the university, but returning regularly to Plymouth to research and run the renowned &#145;Easter&#146; courses, where his colleagues and pupils included many distinguished zoologists. Pantin took his Cambridge ScD in 1933.<br>
<br>Following a period at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples in 1933, Pantin published a series of papers on the functioning of the nervous system of the sea anemone: this was his most influential work. He demonstrated how the organization of the nerve net, and its very low frequency impulses, could produce the response of different muscles each to its appropriate range of impulse rate, and also create integrated movement and behaviour of a comparatively complex kind in seemingly the simplest of nervous organizations. His work formed a foundation from which much of later neurophysiology and the interpretation of behaviour in neural terms originated. Despite contracting tuberculosis, Pantin continued his work, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1937, the year in which he organized the now classic discussion of that body on the transmission of excitation in living material.<br>
<br>Pantin researched the lower animals for the rest of his life, especially the coelenterates and nemertine worms, though with his increasing involvement with the national bodies of his science, this research was increasingly done through associates and assistants. Yet for thirty-five years his lectures to undergraduates communicated an enthusiasm and excitement of a remarkable kind. He became reader in invertebrate zoology in 1937 and succeeded Sir James Gray as professor in 1959. Despite failing health, as head of the zoology department Pantin succeeded in obtaining new buildings for the Museum of Zoology, and a modern research wing which today bears his name. In 1964 he was diagnosed as having leukaemia and he died in the Hope Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 14 January 1967, only a few months after he retired.<br>
<br>Pantin was president of the Linnean Society of London from 1958 to 1960, president of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (1960&#150;66), and from 1963 until his death, chairman of the board of trustees of the Natural History Museum. He received the royal medal of the Royal Society in 1950, and the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1964. He became an honorary member of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1955 and was given honorary doctorates of the universities of S&atilde;o Paulo and Durham. He became an honorary fellow of his old Cambridge college, Christ's. Despite this, those closest to him felt that he did not receive the public recognition he deserved, for he lacked any vestige of ruthlessness or selfishness; he was a man of transparent sincerity and personal charm, who communicated a radiant enjoyment of life and its study.<br>
