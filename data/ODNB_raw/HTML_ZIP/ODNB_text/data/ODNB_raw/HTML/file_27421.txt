<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thynne, Sir  John</span>  (1512/13&#150;1580), <span class="occ">estate manager and builder of Longleat</span>, was born in Church Stretton, Shropshire, the eldest son of Thomas Thynne of Church Stretton, and Margaret, daughter of Thomas Eynns, also of Church Stretton. He was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27426/', "William Thynne")</script>, and was probably encouraged to move to London by his uncle's well-established position in the royal household of Henry VIII; there is no evidence, however, that he was ever in the king's service himself, and he first appears in 1535 as one of the household of Lord Vaux of Harrowden. In 1536 he entered the service of Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp. He served as Seymour's steward from 1536 to 1552, and his fortunes rose with those of his master. He accompanied Seymour on his northern and Scottish expeditions in 1542 and 1544, and was knighted after the battle of Pinkie in 1547. His main activities, however, were in London and the west, where Seymour built up enormous estates following his rise to power as lord protector and his elevation to the dukedom of Somerset in 1547. In London Thynne became a freeman of the City, a member of the Mercers' Company, and Packer of Stranger's Goods, all in 1547, and in 1549 he allied himself to the most powerful of City and Mercer families by his marriage to Christian, daughter of Sir Richard Gresham and sister of Sir Thomas Gresham.<br>
<br>In 1549 Sir William Paget expostulated that &#145;there is no one thing whereof his Grace hath need to take such heed as that man's proceedings&#146;  (Paget to William Petre, 22 July 1549, Tytler, 190), but in fact little has come to light to suggest that Thynne was anything except a hard-working servant of his master, though far from averse to feathering his own nest in the process. On the basis of his stewardship, and his commercial interests in the City, he commenced the building up of large estates, mainly in the west and centring on the former Carthusian priory at Longleat, which he bought from Sir John Horsey in 1540.<br>
<br>The fall of Somerset in 1549 brought Thynne two sessions in the Tower of London, confiscation of a substantial portion of his estates, and the imposition of a large fine. He survived, however, retired to Longleat, and kept a low profile under Mary. The accession of Elizabeth, the return to office of his old friends and colleagues William Cecil, Thomas Smith, and others, and the continuing importance of Thomas Gresham assured him position and prosperity. He consolidated and expanded his estates, not without arousing resentment among longer-established neighbours. When he made his will in 1580, the year of his death, he possessed property in Wiltshire, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, London, Bristol, and Westminster. In 1566 or 1567 he had married, as his second wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1616), daughter of Sir William Wroughton, of Broad Hinton, Wiltshire, with whom he had five sons. With his first wife, Christian Gresham, he had three sons and three daughters. His descendants by his first wife were successively elevated to a baronetcy in 1641, to a viscountcy, as Viscounts Weymouth, in 1682, and to a marquessate, as marquesses of Bath, in 1789.<br>
<br>Thynne was elected member of parliament for Marlborough (probably in 1539 and 1542 as well as 1545), Salisbury (1547), Wiltshire (1559, 1571), Great Bedwyn (1563), and Heytesbury (1572). He was a conscientious member, who sat on various committees, but he never played an important role at Westminster or in national politics. His hostile neighbour William Darrell satirized Thynne as &#145;infecting his master's head with plots and forms and many a subtle thing&#146;, and made the house of Longleat complain:<blockquote>but now see hym that by these thirty years almost with such turmoil of mind hath been thinking of me, framing and erecting me, raising many a time with great care and now and then pulling down this or that part of me to enlarge sometimes a foot or some few inches, uppon a conceit, or this or that man's speech, and by and by beat down windows, for this or that fault here or there. (<span class="italic">Records of the Building of Longleat</span>, 3.213, Thynne Archives, Longleat)</blockquote>This, though written in no friendly spirit, in fact expresses fairly enough Thynne's main claim to fame: less as the servant of the Protector Somerset and the founder of a dynasty than as a patron of architecture whose obsessive and restless perfectionism produced the great house at Longleat, deservedly acclaimed by John Summerson as representing &#145;as no other building does, the momentary High Renaissance of Tudor architecture&#146;  (Summerson, 62).<br>
<br>There is documentary evidence for Thynne's supervision of Somerset's huge house at Bedwyn Brail in Wiltshire, which never got beyond its early stages, and he was almost certainly closely involved with the design and building of Somerset House in the Strand. The design of Somerset House related closely to contemporary classical architecture in France, and was stylistically in advance of anything else being built in England at the time. But in his own house at Longleat, Thynne, at the end of a thirty-seven-year process involving constant rebuilding, rethinking, and enlargement, and interrupted by a serious fire in 1567, developed the forms to be found at Somerset House into a far more integrated classical whole, a compact unity, in which a consistent design based on superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian pilasters was carried round all four external fa&ccedil;ades, and given modelling, strength, and rhythm by the constant repetition of rectangular bay windows.<br>
<br>Although Thynne was capable of making drawings to show what he wanted, his buildings resulted from a combination of his own search for perfection and his employment of a succession of often gifted craftsmen. In its final form the design and detailing of Longleat owed much to a French mason, Alan Maynard, who arrived in 1563, and an English mason, Robert Smythson, who arrived in 1568. Because of the many craftsmen who worked there during its long gestation and moved on elsewhere, Longleat became the seat of a school of building which had repercussions all over the west country and, to a lesser extent, all over England. Thynne died on 21 May 1580 and was buried in the church at Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire.<br>
