<span class="headword">Feirit&eacute;ar,  Piaras</span> <span class="st"> [Piaras mac &Eacute;amainn; <em>known as </em>Sir Pierce Ferriter]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1652), <span class="occ">soldier and poet</span>, belonged to an Anglo-Norman family, originally le Fereter, which since the thirteenth century had held estates on the Dingle peninsula in co. Kerry. The family lived unobtrusively until the troubled Tudor and Stuart period; then, some of its members were the subjects of royal pardons in 1574, 1601, and 1602. In 1626 an Edmund Ferriter was the subject of an inquisition. Piaras was this Edmund's son and was known in Irish as Piaras mac &Eacute;amainn. He had a son, Major Dominic. Little more is known of his near kin.<br>
<br>Before the confederate wars Feirit&eacute;ar was on good terms with others of his social class in the region, irrespective of affiliation. When war threatened it was assumed that he would defend the established order. The governor of co. Kerry therefore helped him to equip a force, but Feirit&eacute;ar joined the Catholic confederation in the siege and capture of Tralee and Castlemaine. Taking charge of these positions, he held the peninsula for the confederation throughout the war. After 1649 confederates and royalists were gradually defeated by the forces of parliament. On 22 June 1652 Lord Muskerry, commander-in-chief in Munster, capitulated and surrendered Ross Castle in Killarney. All that remained was &#145;to clear&#146; the county of Kerry &#145;of such of the Irish Rebels as have not submitted, and come in with Lord Muskerry&#146;  (Gilbert, 340). Feirit&eacute;ar was now isolated. He surrendered on the promise of immunity, but within days was arrested on the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Nelson, and was later hanged at Sheep's Mount, Killarney, co. Kerry. The details of these last events are uncertain. Following Ua Duinn&iacute;n, the year of his death is generally given as 1653, the year in which Ua Duinn&iacute;n erroneously believed that Ross Castle was surrendered. He had no reason to suppose that Piaras was held for long in captivity. The available evidence suggests that he was promptly enough executed, in 1652.<br>
<br>In oral tradition Feirit&eacute;ar became a folk hero who protected his people against iniquitous rent, cunningly eluded his pursuers, and had a gift for extempore verse. He had indeed been a poet, though scarcely more than ten poems can now with certainty be ascribed to him. They survive mainly in late manuscripts (principally in the collections of the Royal Irish Academy, St Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the National Library of Ireland), and there are some unresolved textual difficulties. His <i>tuireamh</i>, or formal elegy, on Sir Muiris Mac Gearailt is most widely represented in manuscript, being admired by scribes for its rhetorical vigour, but modern taste prefers his personal poetry, his love-poem for Meg Russell, for instance, or his expression of deep affection for Risteard Husae. His eminence as a poet, and as a generous patron of literature and music, is acclaimed in contemporary records, and undoubtedly much has been lost. Yet, although the quantity of his extant poetry is slight, its quality has secured an honoured place for Piaras Feirit&eacute;ar in the Irish literary canon.<br>
