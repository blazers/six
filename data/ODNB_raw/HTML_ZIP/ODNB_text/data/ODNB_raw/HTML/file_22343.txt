<span class="headword">Pittis,  William</span>  (1673/4&#150;1724), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22342/', "Thomas Pittis (bap. 1636, d. 1687)")</script> of Niton, Isle of Wight, rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Stephens of Newport, Isle of Wight. His elder brother, Thomas, later became vicar of Warnham in Sussex. From 1687 Pittis was educated at Winchester College, and aged sixteen he matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 14 August 1690; he graduated BA four years later and was a full fellow of the college between 1692 and 1695. In 1708 he published a verse essay, <span class="italic">Aesop's Oxford</span>, which satirized many of the prevailing modes of the day and was reissued a year later as <span class="italic">Bickerstaff's Aesop</span>. On leaving the university he became a member of the Inner Temple, London.<br>
<br>Pittis is better known for his political writings sympathetic to the tory and high-church cause. In 1702 he published <span class="italic">The Patriots, in Vindication of Several Members of the Late Parliament</span>, in which he praised its dedicatee, Robert Harley, then speaker of the Commons, along with Simon Harcourt and Anthony Hammond as true defenders of the national interest. The failure of a third bill to prohibit occasional conformity later prompted Pittis to publish <span class="italic">The Memorial to the Church of England</span> (1704) with Henry Foley, MP for Ipswich, and the physician and tory pamphleteer James Drake (1667&#150;1707). The treatise, which drew attention to the dangers faced by Anglicanism&#151;&#145;there is a <i>Hectick fever</i> lurking in the very <i>Bowels</i> of it&#146;  (p. 3)&#151;was regarded as an attack on Queen Anne's rule over the church and prompted its burning by the common hangman. On 27 April 1706 Pittis himself was fined &pound;100 and ordered by the court of queen's bench to stand in the pillory three times for his part in the publication. In December 1714 he was again in trouble, for having published his <span class="italic">Reasons for a War with France</span>; this time he was arrested and later bailed, apparently without charge. His other political works included parliamentary histories for the period 1702&#150;4, which paid close attention to the resistance to occasional conformity, and for sessions during 1710 and 1711.<br>
<br>Pittis's other publications included an edition of the <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> &#145;rendered into familiar verse&#146; (1701), a <span class="italic">Hymn to Neptune</span> (1705), following Admiral Rooke's victory at the battle of Velez-Malaga, an unpublished elegy for Sir Cloudesley Shovell following the death of that admiral in 1707, and a life of the Oxford physician John Radcliffe (1715, 4th edition 1724). He died at the Inner Temple in November 1724.<br>
