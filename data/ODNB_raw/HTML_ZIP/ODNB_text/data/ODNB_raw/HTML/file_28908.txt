<span class="headword">Weale,  John</span>  (1791&#150;1862), <span class="occ">publisher and writer on architecture</span>, was born in Westminster and began work as an errand-boy to Thomas King, a bookseller of Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, London. Nothing is known of his parentage or life prior to this, but, suffering mistreatment at the hands of King, he subsequently moved to the nearby establishment of George Priestley, a bookseller and publisher at 5 High Street, St Giles-in-the-Fields, and he continued to work for Priestley's widow, Mary, after the former's death about 1812. He was taken into partnership about 1819; while neither of the Priestleys had published extensively, Weale's interest in architecture soon led to a rapid expansion of the firm's activity in this area. Priestley and Weale became one of the leading architectural publishers of the period, although it was not particularly financially successful. Moreover, Weale's evident ability attracted the attention of the pre-eminent architectural bookseller and publisher Isaac Taylor, who instructed his executors to assist Weale in purchasing his business at 59 High Holborn, London, on his death, which occurred in 1834. Weale accepted the offer, and rapidly expanded his business, publishing extensively on all aspects of architecture and engineering. According to his <span class="italic">Statistical Notices of Works on the Fine and the Constructive Arts</span> (1859; 2nd edn, 1861), he expended over &pound;200,000 on the production of books during his forty years as a publisher, although not with great profit to himself.<br>
<br>Weale had a hand in suggesting and improving many of the books he published, and he displayed considerable ability as the author or editor of numerous works on a wide range of architectural and technical subjects. Most noteworthy of his works was the elaborately illustrated and widely praised <span class="italic">Divers Works of Early Masters in Christian Decoration</span> (1846), which earned him a gold medal from the king of Belgium in 1847. In addition, his <span class="italic">Rudimentary Dictionary of Terms used in Architecture, Building, and Engineering</span> (1849&#150;50) elicited favourable reviews, and reached a fifth edition in 1876. This volume became part of what was arguably Weale's greatest publishing success, namely his <span class="roman">Rudimentary Series</span>, begun in 1848, which comprised more than 130 scientific and technical works, generally written by eminent men, and usually published at 1<i>s</i>. per volume. Weale invested over &pound;48,000 in the series during the thirteen years before he sold it to James Sprent Virtue, and the venture was a considerable financial success, with sales of some volumes reaching 40,000 copies by 1854. Weale subsequently published an educational and a classical series in a similar format, these works together constituting an important innovation in cheap educational literature.<br>
<br>Weale married, on 14 February 1833, Sarah Hollis Isabella Jackson Puttnam (1813&#150;1887), daughter of George Puttnam. He died of bronchitis at his home at 19 Canterbury Villas, Maida Vale, London, on 18 December 1862 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. The business was continued by his wife for the benefit of their still young family of four daughters and four sons, until 1864, when it was taken over by their second son, James Watt Weale (1843&#150;1877).<br>
