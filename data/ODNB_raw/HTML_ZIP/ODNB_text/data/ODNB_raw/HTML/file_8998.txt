<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Everard,  John</span>  (1584?&#150;1640/41), <span class="occ">preacher and religious controversialist</span>, has been identified as the John Everard born on 19 April 1584 and baptized the same day at St Peter's, Deene, Northamptonshire, the second child and eldest son of Christopher Everard (<i>d</i>. 1608), rector there, and his wife, Elizabeth Diggles, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palladay. Some circumstantial evidence supports this, but the preacher himself did not name his parents and there were at least two John Everards whose early lives have been confused [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8997/', "Everard, John (b. 1586/?)")</script>]; it is just possible, given his later connection with the Rich family, that he was a member of the puritan Everard family of Essex rather than of the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire family, several of whom were recusants. Although he claimed that he had wasted his youth in ignorance and error, he was certainly well educated, since in later life he translated from Greek, Latin, and possibly Arabic, and it is plausible that he was one of the John Everards admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, either in 1597, as a Leeds scholar, or in 1603. The former graduated BA in 1601, and one proceeded MA in 1607. Given that he later held benefices, it is likely that it was he who was made a deacon in 1606 and who was ordained priest in 1609 in the diocese of Peterborough. He may have been the John Everard who in 1610 presented himself at the English College in Rome as a convert to Catholicism, only to repudiate his new faith in print the following year, but the internal contradictions in this man's testimony further weaken an already unproven link.<br>
<br>By 1618 John Everard the preacher was a lecturer at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. He may have been the John Everard or Everett who with his wife Frances had three children baptized in the parish, John (<i>bap</i>. 1617, <i>d</i>. 1621), James (<i>bap</i>. 1627), and Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1630, <i>d</i>. 1632); equally, the children's father may have been a John Everett (<i>d</i>. 1631). Everard the lecturer was probably the man who proceeded BD from Cambridge in 1619; by the 1620s he was known as Dr Everard, although there is no record of this degree. He quickly attracted unfavourable attention for outspokenness. By about the beginning of 1618 he had attacked the administration of the court of orphans, for which the lord mayor and aldermen of London were responsible, and he had been censured by the bishop and admonished that if he spoke the truth it should not be before a large number of people. Plainly trouble was feared. In the same year Everard published a sermon preached at St Andrew's Holborn, as lecturer at St Martin-in-the-Fields: in <span class="italic">The Arriereban</span> he expounded godly attitudes to war, believing that malicious people desired to disgrace him, perhaps for stating that God's power, much more than the king's, was not to be questioned, and for the general implication that war against Spain would be in a good cause, as parliament urged. Over Christmas 1620 he prayed that the English might be delivered from a Catholic king, as they already were from Catholic bishops&#151;a direct challenge to the proposed terms of the Spanish marriage. In February 1621 he attacked the Spanish match directly in a sermon in St Martin's, and was imprisoned in the Gatehouse for about six months, after which he asked pardon and promised amendment.<br>
<br>Soon after this Everard was presented to the living of Hinton Martell in Dorset, and in 1622, ironically by James I, to Wilby in Northamptonshire, which he held until 1627. However in August 1622 he attacked the liberation of all Roman Catholic priests and refusers of the oath of supremacy in connection with the Spanish marriage, and consequently was committed to the Marshalsea prison. After his release, in December he visited Tregony in Cornwall and, as the result of seeing a triple sun in the sky, published an anonymous tract, <span class="italic">Somewhat Written by Occasion of Three Sunnes Seen at Tregnie</span> (1622), warning that God &#145;is whetting his sword, and making ready his quiver for impenitent sinners&#146;, because most of the church was deceived, implicitly by Roman Catholicism. In March 1623 he was once again imprisoned for expressing unease about the Spanish match. Powerful friends such as Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, had repeatedly pleaded for his release, but finally James I's patience wore out. He is reported to have said, &#145;Who is this Dr Ever-out you come so oft about? his name shall be Dr Never-out&#146;. In all, Everard stated that he was imprisoned six or seven times.<br>
<br>By 1626 the emphasis of Everard's preaching began to change. He was investigated by Bishop George Montaigne of London for arguing that it was unlawful to pray for temporal blessings. This marks a step towards the more contemplative content of his later sermons, like <span class="italic">The Rending of the Vail</span>. Influenced by the Dominican mystic Johannes Tauler (1300&#150;1361), Everard increasingly expounded humility, simplicity, and letting God have his way in individual lives as important themes. He then became chaplain to Henry Rich, Lord Holland, and moved to Holland House in Kensington. He was also lecturer at the parish church by September 1628, by which time he was renowned as a preacher, drawing a very wide auditory from all sections of society. Sermons preached in city churches like St Giles Cripplegate may date from this time.<br>
<br>According to Rapha Harford, who knew Everard well&#151;and who wrote a foreword to the 1659 edition of Everard's <span class="italic">The Gospel Treasury Opened</span>&#151;bishops attacked him and deprived him of benefices worth &pound;400. Perhaps these were actually lectureships. Certainly he was not rector of Fairstead, Essex, as has been assumed; John Etheridge was incumbent by 1628, and resigned in 1643. The John Evered of Fairstead summoned and dismissed by the court of high commission in 1636 was more likely to have been a member of the Everard family of Essex. It seems certain, however, that he was deprived of substantial sources of income. According to Harford his reaction was to kneel in court, praising God, and saying, &#145;The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof: therefore I will not fear&#146;, and, with St Stephen, &#145;Lay not this sin to their charge&#146;  (Everard, c4). He refused to submit, though William Laud reputedly threatened to bring him to a morsel of bread.<br>
<br>In the late 1630s Everard was the dominant figure influencing London separatism outside the Baptists, though probably not formally separated. Many of his sermons were preached at &#145;public meeting places&#146; in Kensington, and fashionable Middlesex villages like Islington, and he also preached privately, especially in Kensington. He is mentioned as a separatist in 1638, and may have had links with the Familists, one of whom he helped. By this time he was influenced by Henry Niclaes, and the medieval <span class="italic">Theologia Germanica</span> favoured by Martin Luther. He translated the latter at this time, and made copies for the earls of Holland and Mulgrave. His other translations included &#145;The letter and the life, or, The flesh and the spirit&#146; and, from works by Sebastien Franck, &#145;The tree of life&#146; and &#145;The vision of God&#146;. Their thought later had an influence on the early Quakers, probably partly through his preaching. Some or all of these books were copied by Woulston, a Chancery Lane scrivener, and bound by Rapha Harford.<br>
<br>In November 1637 the privy council issued a warrant to search Everard's house in Fulham, seize all his papers, and remove those concerning the state. Perhaps these provided material for his trial by the high commission, where he was, according to Harford, falsely accused. He was charged with keeping conventicles and on 11 July 1639 fined &pound;1000 for teaching and publishing heretical doctrine. Such a crippling fine must have been intended to be unpayable, and he was imprisoned. Though negotiations about his submission began in November, only after conferring with the bishops of Ely and Rochester, and reference to Archbishop Laud, did he finally read his submission kneeling in June 1640. He was released from clerical suspension, and in July his fine was remitted. He predicted the downfall of bishops should there be a parliament which the king could not dissolve.<br>
<br>William Penn described Everard as a renowned Independent, and as the great spiritual separatist. He was princely in presence and behaviour, yet able to mix with the humblest if they wished to learn. His greatest desire was to share his faith clearly with others, and he counted all his intellectual gifts as dung beside knowing Christ crucified. His words are notable for their love: &#145;Beloved&#146; is his usual way of addressing his hearers, and his sermons burn with an eagerness for his hearers to share in a deep encounter with God which he plainly experienced. He describes how, to a repenting and bleeding soul, God appears &#145;in Mercy and Love, and Marrieth himself to them, and as he communicates to them his sweet Loves, so their <i>Wills</i> and their <i>Loves</i> are swallowed up in his&#146;  (Everard, 7). His portrait, engraved by T. Cross, shows a plump man, ruffed and gowned, with a little goatee beard, and dark, curly, shoulder-length hair. The verse beneath catches the spirit of his admirers' views:<blockquote>
<div>This is the Shadow of that House of Clay<br>
</div>
<div>Where dwelt a Soule who richly did Display<br>
</div>
<div>Such Light of Trueth abroad, as did Unseal<br>
</div>
<div>The Book of God and Hidden Things Reveal.<br>
</div> (ibid., frontispiece)</blockquote>Everard died in Fulham, Middlesex, leaving a modest sum, at the end of 1640 or in early January, 1641, when administration of his goods was granted. In 1658 Elias Ashmole published <span class="italic">The Way to Blisse</span>, an anonymous work of natural philosophy dated by Ashmole to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, to which &#145;the industrious Dr Everard&#146;  (&#145;To the Reader&#146;) had added explicatory marginal notes.<br>
