<span class="headword">Thurston,  John</span>  (1774&#150;1822), <span class="occ">draughtsman</span>, was born at Scarborough and educated at the Hornsey Academy. He commenced his career as a copperplate-engraver working under James Heath, whom he assisted on two of his chief plates, <span class="italic">The Death of Major Peirson</span>, after J. S. Copley, and <span class="italic">The Dead Soldier</span>, after Joseph Wright of Derby. Later he took up wood-engraving, and eventually he devoted himself exclusively to designing book illustrations. In this he was highly successful, and most of the editions of the poets and novelists published during the first twenty years of the nineteenth century, especially those issued by the Chiswick Press, were embellished by his pencil. Many of Thurston's drawings were engraved on copper for Sharpe's and Cooke's classics and similar works, but the bulk of them, drawn on the block, were cut by Luke Clennell, Robert Branston, Charlton Nesbit, John Thompson, and other able wood-engravers. Among his designs of this class are the illustrations to James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> (1805); James Beattie's <span class="italic">Minstrel</span> (1807); J. Thomas's <span class="italic">Religious Emblems</span> (1809), a much admired work which was reissued in 1816 and published in Germany in 1818; Shakespeare's works (1814); Somerville's <span class="italic">Rural Sports</span> (1814); James Puckle's <span class="italic">The Club</span> (1817); and William Falconer's <span class="italic">The Shipwreck</span> (1817).<br>
<br>Thurston's drawings, outlined in pen or pencil and tinted with India ink, were pleasing though somewhat stiff affairs. They were admirably adapted to the wood-engraver's art, which was carried to its greatest perfection under his influence. Thurston was for a time &#145;the principal artist in London who had any repute as a designer on the wood&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 431), and he made a significant contribution to the formation of a modern school of wood-engraving. He was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in December 1805 but contributed only to the exhibition of 1806, sending five Shakespearian groups; he was also an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1794 to 1812. Being of a delicate constitution and retiring nature, Thurston was personally little known; he died at his house at Holloway, London, in 1822, his life being shortened by overwork in pursuit of his art. He had two sons, G. and J. C. Thurston, who practised as artists and occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy.<br>
