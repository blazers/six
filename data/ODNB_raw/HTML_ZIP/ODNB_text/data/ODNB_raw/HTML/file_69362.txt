<span class="headword">Ernley, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1464&#150;1520), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of John Ernley (<i>d</i>. 1465), landowner of Sidlesham near Chichester, Sussex, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1485), daughter of Nicholas Morley (1410&#150;1472&times;4) and Joan Waleys, both of Glynde, near Lewes, Sussex. The family had been lords of the manor of Earnley near Chichester since the thirteenth century, and Ernley rose from local to national prominence in the administration of justice and finance under Henry VII and Henry VIII.<br>
<br>Ernley probably owed his upbringing, and certainly his marriage, to John Wood of Chichester, who may have been his stepfather&#151;having possibly married Margaret Ernley at some point after 1465. After a preliminary legal education at an inn of chancery (<i>c</i>.1478&#150;80) he was admitted to Gray's Inn. In 1485 Wood left Ernley extensive property in St Olave Old Jewry which had belonged to his brother, Sir John Wood, treasurer of the exchequer and speaker of the House of Commons in 1483, on condition that he marry Wood's great-niece Margaret Dawtry (<i>c</i>.1470&#150;1518); they married shortly after 1485. Ernley secured this inheritance only after litigation to oust the treasurer's widow Margery. By 1490 he was established in London, noticed by his students as an increasingly conspicuous member of the Sussex circle gathered around Edmund Dudley at Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>In his county Ernley sustained a substantial legal practice as feoffee, arbitrator, commissioner, and justice, joining the home assize circuit as an associate in 1496 and 1497 and the county bench the following year. He acquired ecclesiastical patronage in the same decade, acting as steward of a Battle Abbey manor in the west of the county, taking a place among Edward Story, bishop of Chichester's council, and beginning the family's tenure of the episcopal manor house at Cakeham, Sussex, to which he may have added its innovative brick tower.<br>
<br>During these years Ernley had, at least as counsel, an unremarkable practice in the central courts. But in the first decade of the new century his horizons expanded. He began to act as one of Dudley's feoffees, and it was almost certainly to Henry VII's minister that he owed his unheralded appointment as attorney-general, replacing the out of favour James Hobart on 12 July 1507. Having paid a premium of &pound;100 for his office Ernley readily joined Sir Richard Empson and Dudley in the financial exactions for which they alone became notorious. The association also paid dividends in Sussex, where Ernley may have involved Dudley in his local affairs to enable his cousin Agnes Morley's foundation of Lewes grammar school in December 1507.<br>
<br>Henry VIII reappointed him on 28 April 1509 and, though Empson and Dudley went to the block, Ernley prospered. Within a year he devised a scheme to thwart the claim of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, to the office of constable of England, despite secretly admitting that he had a strong right to the title. His adroit handling of such issues soon brought him additional responsibilities. One of the most frequent attenders among the judicial members of the king's council he was assiduous in enforcing royal rights to feudal revenues and took an active role in parliament: forty-nine bills were committed to the attorney- or solicitor-general in the assemblies of 1510, 1512, and 1515. His disqualification by office from the order of serjeants-at-law was no handicap to advancement: he remained at Gray's Inn, probably as senior bencher, and in 1510 began to ride the northern assize circuit. He took the home circuit for a year in 1516&#150;17, the western circuit until 1519, and the Norfolk circuit for the rest of his life, almost invariably paired with another Gray's Inn man. Increasingly in demand as a feoffee Ernley was &#145;especial good master and friend&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5813, fol. 116<i>r</i>) to the University of Cambridge, on whose behalf he obstructed a writ of <i>praemunire</i>.<br>
<br>Ernley invested his growing wealth in Sussex, not always scrupulously. There is more than a suspicion that he exploited Dudley's fall to gain outright possession of the manor of Sheffield in Fletching near Lewes, which Roger Lewknor had ceded to Dudley's feoffees in 1508 in a successful bargain to escape conviction for murder. While in the Tower of London, Dudley made provision in his will to defeat Ernley's ambitions; the title remained in dispute in chancery and on the latter's conscience until the end of his life, when he compensated Lewknor's family in his will &#145;not of duty &hellip; but of my charity&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/20, sig. 3).<br>
<br>When Robert Rede, the chief justice of the court of common pleas, died on 8 January 1519 corners were cut to put Ernley in his place. Having spent a single day as a serjeant-at-law he replaced Rede on 27 January in the first documented instance of a private call. As well as three puisne judges, Ernley's elevation <i>per saltum</i> passed over the entire order of the coif. He was knighted that spring but the hopes vested in him came to a premature end when, after only five terms in his new court, he died on 22 April 1520, still in his mid-fifties, having requested burial at Sidlesham, near Chichester. His wife had predeceased him in August 1518. Although his son William Ernley (1501&#150;1546) enjoyed an ample inheritance, followed him at Gray's Inn, and sat for Chichester in the parliament of 1542, he failed to achieve his father's eminence. The family's fortunes were to be carried on by its Wiltshire branch, descended (to the subsequent confusion of genealogists) from Ernley's elder brother, John Ernley (<i>b</i>. 1461/2) of Fosbury and Bishops Cannings.<br>
