<span class="headword">Siward</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>d.</em> 1055), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, first appears witnessing as <i>dux</i> in a charter by King Cnut for Archbishop &AElig;lfric of York in 1033. Siward's name (Sigvarthr) suggests that he was of Danish stock, although the names of his parents are unknown. The life of King Edward recorded his nickname as &#145;Digri&#146;, or &#145;Digara&#146;, from the Danish <i>Diger</i> meaning &#145;the Stout&#146;, or &#145;the Strong&#146;. A legend preserved in the twelfth century noted that Siward was descended from the union of a white bear and a noblewoman.<br>
<br>Siward succeeded <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39234/', "Earl Erik of Hlathir")</script> in southern Northumbria between 1023 and 1033, the dates of Erik's last appearance in a charter and Siward's first. Siward was one of those to whom Cnut delegated significant authority in England while he was occupied in his Scandinavian lands. The northern part of Northumbria remained in the hands of the earls of Bamburgh. Eadulf Cudel had succeeded his brother Earl Uhtred <i>c</i>.1016 and was, in turn, succeeded by Uhtred's son Ealdred. Earl Ealdred was himself followed by another Eadulf, who was Uhtred's son by another wife. In 1041, however, Siward killed this Earl Eadulf and assumed control of all Northumbria. Siward played a significant role in the politics of the kingdom of the English during the reigns of Cnut, Harthacnut, and Edward the Confessor, often acting in concert with Earl Leofric of Mercia in opposition to the Godwine family. A measure of his activity may be obtained by examining his attestation of royal charters in this period. For example, he witnessed a lease of land by &AElig;lfwine, bishop of Winchester, to Osgod in 1043 or 1044, possibly around the time of the attack on Queen Emma described below. He was also a witness to the endowment of Stow St Mary by Earl Leofric and his wife, Godgifu, between 1053 and 1055. This may reflect his close relationship with the comital house of Mercia. For a time Siward seems to have held the earldom of Huntingdon and there is a semi-legendary account of his slaying of a certain Tostig, earl of Huntingdon.<br>
<br>In 1041 Siward took part in an attack on the monastery and town of Worcester following the murder there of two of King Harthacnut's tax gatherers, Feader and Thurstan. After Edward the Confessor's coronation, Siward, together with earls Leofric and Godwine, advised the king to ride from Gloucester to Winchester. The earls accompanied him and, on 16 November 1043, they arrested Emma, the queen mother. Emma's wealth was confiscated on the grounds that she had not aided Edward as much as she might have done and that she had been harsh towards him. An account of the translation of St Mildrith added that Emma was accused of inciting King Magnus of Norway to attack Edward's realm. During the crisis of 1051&#150;2, when Earl Godwine and his sons collected their forces and threatened the king near Gloucester, Siward acted together with Earl Leofric of Mercia and Earl Ralph in first opposing Godwine and his family on the king's behalf and then allowing them to regain their positions in 1052. The C and D texts of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> suggest that the earls' hesitancy in attacking Godwine and then allowing his return was born of a fear that civil war would leave the kingdom open to foreign invasion.<br>
<br>Siward is named by the Norman chronicler William of Poitiers as being one of those magnates of England who swore an oath to secure Duke William of Normandy's succession to the English throne. Siward's rule in Northumbria was seen as particularly harsh but effective by contemporary sources. The life of King Edward describes how before the earl's time parties of even twenty or thirty men were not safe from robbers, but that Siward's policy of killing or mutilating the miscreants, however noble, brought security to the region. Siward may also have expanded his control into Cumbria, as a writ issued in the name of a certain Gospatric, ruler of that area, seems to suggest that he was under Siward's overlordship. Siward reinstated &AElig;thelric, bishop of Durham, who had offered him money after being driven out of his bishopric by the community of St Cuthbert in 1045. In 1054 Siward invaded Scotland on behalf of his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17859/', "Malcolm Canmore (d. 1093)")</script>, who claimed the throne of his father, Duncan, in opposition to Macbeth. Soon after Duncan's overthrow in 1040 Malcolm had fled Scotland and found a refuge at his uncle's court in York. According to some sources it was on the order of Edward the Confessor that Siward prepared a land and sea assault against Macbeth. Having routed the Scots and their Norman allies, the earl ravaged the kingdom, so the twelfth-century chronicler Henry of Huntingdon reported. During the decisive battle on the Day of the Seven Sleepers (27 July 1054), fought in Perthshire, north of the River Tay, Siward's son, Osbeorn, was killed together with the earl's nephew, another Siward.<br>
<br>Earl Siward married first &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, a daughter of Earl Ealdred of Bamburgh, and they had at least two sons, Osbeorn and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28646/', "Waltheof")</script>; it is not known whether the couple had any daughters. A second wife, Godgifu, is recorded as promising to give the two estates of Belmesthorpe and Ryhall near Stamford to Peterborough Abbey on her death. She predeceased Siward and he made an agreement with the abbey whereby he held both estates until his death. According to <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> the manors were held by Waltheof at the time of King Edward's death and by Waltheof's widow, Judith, in 1086.<br>
<br>Henry of Huntingdon described Earl Siward as a giant of a man &#145;whose vigour of mind was equal to his bodily strength&#146;  (Huntingdon, <span class="italic">Historia Anglorum</span> (OMT), 376). During an attack on Scotland, when one of his sons was killed, Siward enquired whether he had received his wound in front or behind. When informed that the wound had been received in front, the earl rejoiced that his son had died a fitting death. This may refer to the death of Osbeorn at the hands of the Scots in 1054. Also according to Henry of Huntingdon, Earl Siward himself died of dysentery. He felt ashamed that he was not going to die in one of his many battles and asked to be dressed in his armour, so that, with shield and battleaxe in his hands, he might die a soldier's death. This was at York, before mid-Lent 1055, when he was buried in the monastery which he had founded at &#145;Galmanho&#146;, dedicated to St Olaf, king and martyr&#151;which indicates Siward's continued Danish sympathies. Bootham Bar in York was formerly Galmanhithe and the site of the monastery there was given to St Mary's Abbey, York. The earldom was given to Tostig, son of Earl Godwine of Wessex, possibly because Siward's surviving son, Waltheof, was still young in 1055 and the influence of the Godwine faction at court was overwhelming. According to <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, Earl Siward and his son held lands worth around &pound;350. This cannot, however, represent the total value of his estates while in office, as <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> did not survey the lands to the north of the River Tees or the larger part of Cumbria. Siward's recorded lands lay in Derbyshire and in Yorkshire, most notably at Whitby.<br>
