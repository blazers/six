<span class="headword">Burgoyne,  Peter Bond</span>  (1844&#150;1929), <span class="occ">wine merchant</span>, was born on 7 February 1844 at Dodbrook, Kingsbridge, Devon, the son of John Trist Burgoyne (<i>c</i>.1812&#150;1856), beer and porter merchant, and his wife, Mary Ann Bond (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;1854). Of his early years and education nothing is known, but in 1858, two years after his father's death, Burgoyne went to Newfoundland. He may have been apprenticed to Messrs Brooking &amp; Co. of St John's, where he worked as a clerk, as he remained in the colony for no more than seven years. On his return to England in 1865 Burgoyne took employment as an estate agent before becoming a clerk to a London wine shipping firm of which he later became manager and where he was largely responsible for the introduction of Hungarian wines into England. In 1871 he set up in business on his own account, trading from offices and cellars at 50 Old Broad Street, London. On 28 March 1872 he married Marie Henrietta Johanna (1848/9&#150;1934), daughter of Charles Achilles, artist of Acton.<br>
<br>Following an introduction to Dr Alexander Charles Kelly, manager and principal shareholder in the Tintara Vineyard Company of McLaren Vale in South Australia, Burgoyne agreed to represent the company, and the Tintara Vineyard Association was established in 1872. Existing prejudices for the wines of the Old World made sales difficult to secure, and by the end of year the agency was relaunched as the Australian Vineyards Association, dealing in Australian wines generally. The difficulties experienced by those attempting to introduce Australian wines to the British public at this time were not easily overcome and the debts mounted up. In 1876 the Australian Vineyards Association was purchased by Walter Watson Hughes, a wealthy expatriate and owner of the Fairfield vineyard in South Australia's Clare valley. Wiping the slate clean, Hughes entered into partnership with Burgoyne, who reverted to selling European wines while the Australian wine trade was developed.<br>
<br>The greatest impediment to the trade was the duty structure which tended to penalize Australian wine merchants, who invariably had to pay a surcharge of 150 per cent over and above the standard duty of 1<i>s</i>. per gallon on wines above 26 degrees of proof spirit. In his evidence before the select committee on wine duties in May 1879, Burgoyne repeatedly stated that the natural wines of South Australia contained an average of 29 degrees of proof spirit, and claimed that vineyards in the colony were going out of production because of the high rate of duty in Britain. Not one to miss a marketing opportunity, he was quick to produce five samples of Fairfield wines for the committee to taste.<br>
<br>Burgoyne's fortunes took a turn for the better in 1886 when the duties were modified to accommodate colonial wine growers. This prompted a move to larger premises at Dowgate Hill, London, and the offer of a prize of 50 guineas to be awarded to the exhibitor of a claret style of wine at the Jubilee International Exhibition, to be held in Adelaide in 1887, and other prizes to be offered under the auspices of the South Australian Agricultural Society. In 1888 agents were appointed in Adelaide and Melbourne, and in 1893, on the first of several visits to the colonies, Burgoyne invested in vineyard and cellar accommodation in the Rutherglen district of north-east Victoria. Despite competition from the South Australian government's bonded depot in London, and other importers, Burgoyne soon became the leviathan of the trade selling half a million gallons of wine annually, mainly blends which were marketed under a number of registered brands.<br>
<br>In 1903 the business of P. B. Burgoyne was converted to a limited company. A publicity brochure from this period, &#145;The quality wines of the empire&#146;, quoted the chancellor of the exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who remarked in the Commons in 1899 that &#145;Messrs. Burgoyne have annually during twenty-eight years paid more duty on Australian wines than all the rest of the trade put together&#146;. The wines of the Cape were another departure for Burgoyne, whose name was commemorated by an award at the Western Province Agricultural Society's annual show for many years after his death.<br>
<br>Burgoyne died at his home, Broadlands, Ascot, Berkshire, on 4 September 1929. Numerous bequests were made to long-term members of his domestic and business staff, and a bequest of &pound;1000 was made to the National Hospital for Consumption, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, which Burgoyne served for a total of thirty-eight years, twenty-six of them as chairman. The family business of P. B. Burgoyne &amp; Co. Ltd was continued by Burgoyne's son Cuthbert John (1875&#150;1955), and grandson John Fenner Burgoyne (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;1976).<br>
