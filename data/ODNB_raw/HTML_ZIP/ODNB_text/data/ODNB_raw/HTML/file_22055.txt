<span class="headword">Petrucci,  Ludovico</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1575, <em>d.</em> in or after 1619), <span class="occ">poet and soldier</span>, was born at Pitigliano, near Siena, son of an Italian nobleman, Ariodante Petrucci. In 1597 he was arrested by the inquisition, accused of a number of crimes relating to necromancy, including possession of magic books and summoning of spirits. In particular, he had allegedly persuaded the son of a member of the Neapolitan aristocracy to sell his soul to the devil, and provided another Neapolitan nobleman with a familiar spirit to ensure success in love. It is unclear which members of the aristocracy of Naples were implicated in this matter, though Gabrieli  (p. 300) suggests the duke of Amalfi as a plausible candidate.<br>
<br>Petrucci protested his innocence, claiming that he was being punished for offences committed by others. He remained incarcerated by the inquisition in Padua for four years, a horrifying experience later discussed in his published work. In 1601 he was released, and began a career as a soldier, serving first for the Venetians in Candia (Crete). Between 1603 and 1610 he worked as a soldier in the wars in Hungary, Austria, Moravia, and Germany: his employers during this period included the Holy Roman emperor, the duke of Brandenburg, and the duke of Neuburg.<br>
<br>In April 1609, in D&uuml;sseldorf, the wandering soldier encountered two English merchants, Thomas Stone and James Higgins, and this may have persuaded him to try his luck in England. His arrival in London was noted in a report of 19 August 1610 from the Venetian ambassador, and he is next heard of in Oxford, where he was registered as a student of St Edmund Hall on 27 April 1611. He was later associated with Balliol College, New College, and perhaps others: it seems at least possible that he taught Italian in Oxford. Chronically short of money, Petrucci later wrote warmly of the hospitality provided by the university. In 1613 the university printer published Petrucci's <span class="italic">Raccolta d'alcune rime</span>, a collection of poems in Latin and Italian, containing numerous dedications to royalty and to British notables including Bacon and Archbishop Abbot. The collection is interspersed with letters and testimonials received by Petrucci from patrons across Europe.<br>
<br>Petrucci left Oxford about 1616. Anthony Wood's statement that anti-Catholic feeling forced his departure is perhaps corroborated by Petrucci's repeated attempts to prove by certificates his adherence to the Church of England. On 10 July 1619, incarcerated in the Fleet prison, he wrote the epistle to his second book, <span class="italic">Apologia equitis Ludovici Petrucci contra calumniatores suos</span>. The contents of this book include, once again, a dedication to King James, numerous Latin and Italian poems and prose addresses, and dedications to and testimonials from numerous British and European luminaries. The book also includes emblems, and an engraved portrait of Petrucci by Thomas Pothecary.<br>
<br>In a Latin epistle, Petrucci describes his current plight&#151;which is, presumably, imprisonment for debt&#151;as the culmination of a secret Catholic operation against him which has been active since his first encounter with the inquisition. Throughout his career, he writes, he has been beset by &#145;innumerable enemies of almost every nation and condition&#146; employed by them, including &#145;certain booksellers&#146; who seem to be responsible for his imprisonment  (Gabrieli, 313), and he dwells at some length on this conspiracy.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Petrucci's career after this. As Gabrieli notes, he may have died in the Fleet, but it is just possible that he escaped to further, unknown adventures across Europe. Petrucci's fame lived on in Oxford long enough for Wood to write a note on the unlucky knight, whom he considered &#145;phantasticall&#146; and mentally unbalanced: in a broader sense his work is interesting as part of the story of the British reception of Italian culture.<br>
