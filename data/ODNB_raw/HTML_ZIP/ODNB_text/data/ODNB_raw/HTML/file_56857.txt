<span class="headword">Scudamore, Sir  Barnabas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1609, <em>d.</em> 1651/2), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was baptized on 2 April 1609 at Timsbury, Somerset, the ninth and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76455/', "Sir James Scudamore (bap. 1568, d. 1619)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71878/', "Scudamore family")</script>], and his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Throckmorton (<i>d</i>. 1632), widow of Sir Thomas Baskervile. His parents' marriage had been strained for several years and shortly after his baptism Sir James permanently repudiated his wife, although they were never legally divorced.<br>
<br>Scudamore slipped into the obscurity and comparative poverty of Stuart younger sons. With an income of only about &pound;50 per annum (his eldest brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24975/', "Sir John Scudamore")</script>, from 1628 first Viscount Scudamore, had inherited the bulk of the family's wealth and position) he was forced to seek his own way in the world, and he was later described as &#145;a man of noe fortune&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 6868, fol. 100). He may have been in the earl of Cork's service in Ireland in the summer of 1631, and in December that year he sailed to the Netherlands to enlist as a soldier. He was back in England by March 1636 and in the service of Cork, travelling as an attendant with the earl's two sons to France.<br>
<br>Only as the king's fortunes declined did Scudamore's rise. A captain in the English forces sent against the Scots in 1640, he joined the royalist army promptly on the outbreak of the English civil war and was wounded at Coventry on 20 August 1642, and at Edgehill on 23 October 1642. By the spring of 1643 he was sergeant-major to Colonel Henry Hastings in the midlands, seeing action at Hopton Heath and Lichfield. By May 1644 he had returned to his native Herefordshire where he was major-general to Nicholas Mynne, whom he succeeded as governor of Hereford on 10 September 1644. It was hoped that he would unite soldiers and civilians, and he had the backing of a number of the leading citizens of Hereford where his brother Viscount Scudamore was high steward. Scudamore's zeal in raising men and contributions, and his high-handedness in ignoring due process of law against tax defaulters, however, helped to provoke a club-men rising in March 1645 which was only suppressed with the assistance of Prince Rupert.<br>
<br>As a commander Scudamore was resourceful and resolute. He developed a siege tower which he unsuccessfully used against Canon Frome in November 1645, and in the summer of 1645 he held Hereford for five weeks against a besieging Scottish army. In gratitude the king knighted him and, if a persistent rumour can be credited, would have raised him to a barony had Scudamore been able to afford the creation fees. However, Scudamore also had a fatal flaw&#151;a predilection for arguing. He quarrelled with two of his deputy governors in succession, with disastrous consequences: in revenge one killed his cousin and brother-in-law, Sir John Scudamore of Ballingham; the other later denounced Scudamore to the king as a traitor. Disputes with other junior officers and with the inhabitants of the city led directly to the fall of Hereford to a dawn raid on 18 December 1645.<br>
<br>Scudamore escaped as the city fell and fled to Worcester, but allegations (certainly groundless) that he had betrayed Hereford in return for a large bribe led to his imprisonment on a charge of treachery. He languished in gaol for six months and was only released at the surrender of Worcester in July 1646. Unable to clear his name in a court of war he published his own <span class="italic">Defence</span> in 1646 but many remained convinced that he had sold Hereford to the parliament. On the outbreak of the second civil war he may have been active for the king in Kent in May 1648, and he was certainly trying to raise troops in Newmarket where he was captured in June. On 15 November 1648 he married Katharine Saunders, who appears to have predeceased him. He may previously have been married to a woman with the maiden name Brydges. He was arrested on suspicion of royalist plotting in the summer of 1651, and though soon released, he was in desperate financial straits; he died in London some time between 9 December 1651 (when he wrote to a cousin) and 11 March 1652 when Lord Scudamore wrote of his death.<br>
