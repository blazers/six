<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Henry</span>  (1634&#150;1702), <span class="occ">dean of Norwich</span>, was born at Menston in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and was baptized on 28 October 1634 at Otley, the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9078/', "Charles Fairfax (1597&#150;1673)")</script>, antiquary and genealogist, and Mary Breary (<i>bap</i>. 1609, <i>d</i>. 1657), and a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Thomas, first Lord Fairfax (1560&#150;1640)")</script>. He was a cousin of Thomas Fairfax, the parliamentarian general. Fairfax clearly took some pride in his family, as he wrote a panegyrical Latin poem to his cousin (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 32). He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 21 July 1653, graduating BA in 1657 and MA in 1659, and in 1659 was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, from where he graduated BD in 1666 and DD in 1681. Within Magdalen, Fairfax took his due share of college duties, acting as bursar, dean of divinity, and vice-president, and in 1683 was presented to the college living of Tubney, Berkshire. He evidently remained a Yorkshireman at heart: Henry Clerke, president of Magdalen (1672&#150;87), once described Fairfax as speaking &#145;very bluntly (and with too much shew of his northern humour)&#146;  (Magd. Oxf., MS 427, fol. 59<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Fairfax's unexceptional career was transformed by the death of Clerke in March 1687, and the subsequent efforts of James II to impose a president of his choice on the college, when (perhaps mindful of his older cousin's stand against excessive royal authority) Fairfax achieved a national reputation through the leading role he took in the fellows' struggle against the crown to elect their own candidate, John Hough. By now senior fellow of Magdalen, Fairfax showed his courage best on two occasions when he was brought before commissioners sent to investigate Magdalen. At the first of these, held in London on 13 June, Fairfax put his &#145;northern humour&#146; to good effect when he told the lord chancellor, George Jeffreys, that he did not recognize the commission's jurisdiction. According to one source (Magd. Oxf., MS 432), an infuriated Jeffreys told Fairfax that he should have been &#145;brought to me in the Chancery, as a Lunatiq&#146;, and that &#145;the room is too light for you, you are mad&#146;, and on 22 June Fairfax was suspended from his fellowship. At another commission, held in Oxford in October, he was the only fellow to refuse outright to accept James's candidate as president, and was finally expelled from the college. Most of the other fellows, perhaps emboldened by Fairfax's resistance, eventually also refused to co-operate with the commissioners, who therefore expelled them all and, in December 1687, banned them and Fairfax from receiving any post within the church.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1688, as James's power ebbed, Fairfax and the other fellows were restored to their emoluments. After his courageous behaviour his preferment was only a matter of time, and on 23 September 1689 he was appointed dean of Norwich, a post he held until his death. Fairfax was not a successful dean. Perhaps promoted beyond his ability, he acquired a reputation for being high-handed with the cathedral prebendaries, for excessive drinking, and for taking little or no interest in his duties. He died at Norwich on 20 May 1702 (thus his memorial; his tombstone says it was 10 May) and was buried in the cathedral, where his nephew and heir, Thomas, erected a memorial to him. Fairfax never married, and no portraits of him are known to survive. He is thought to have written the pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Impartial Relation of the Proceedings Against St. Mary Magdalen College in Oxford</span> (1688; 2nd edn, 1689), which, despite its title, none the less subtly defends the fellows' cause through its judicious selection of documents quoted.<br>
