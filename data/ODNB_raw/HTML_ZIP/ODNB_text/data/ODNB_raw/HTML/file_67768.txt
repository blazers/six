<span class="headword">Quin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Marshall]</span>,  Anne</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1660&#150;1682), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was possibly the daughter of Mr Marshall, chaplain to Lord Gerard, and Elizabeth Dutton, illegitimate daughter of John Dutton of Cheshire. She was thought to have been &#145;educated by godly parents&#146;  (Fane, 352). Her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67779/', "Rebecca Marshall")</script> also became an actress. Anne was one of the first female performers on the London stage, with the King's Company on 26 March 1661  (TNA: PRO, LC 3/73, p. 113). Manuscript casts suggest that Richard Flecknoe intended her to play a breeches role, Aurindo, in his <span class="italic">Erminia</span> in the 1660&#150;61 season, and she was possibly cast, with her younger sister Rebecca, in Thomas Heywood's <span class="italic">The Royall King</span> the following year.<br>
<br>Anne was a flexible performer, playing comedic roles such as Margareta in Fletcher's <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>, Celia in his <span class="italic">The Humorous Lieutenant</span> (which opened the Bridges Street theatre), and Mrs Diligence in John Wilson's <span class="italic">The Cheats</span>. She was also popular in John Dryden's and Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span>, when Pepys thought &#145;the eldest Marshall did do her part most excellently well as ever I heard woman in my life; but her voice is not so sweet as Ianthe's [Mrs Betterton]&#146;  (Pepys, 25 Jan 1664). She had several supporting tragic roles, such as Almeria in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span>, and another breeches role as the battling Florio in William Killigrew's <span class="italic">The Siege of Urbin</span>.<br>
<br>Anne Marshall became Mrs Quin or Guin in 1666/7 (causing much confusion with Nell Gwyn), when she married, probably, the actor Peter Quyn, who only appears in records when arrested for acting without a warrant on 28 January 1668 (TNA: PRO, LC 5/186, p. 193; Wilson, 169). Anne seems to have suffered a setback in 1667, recorded only in the minor role of Candiope in Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span> in February. In May of that year she used the lord chamberlain to order the King's Company to return her larger roles to her, and to allot her &#145;a dressing roome with a chymney in it to be only for her use &amp; whome she shall admit&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 5/138, p. 376). This indicates her significance to the company, and although Pepys thought less of her acting by 1668, he acknowledged that she was increasingly popular. Of her performance as Zempoalla in <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span>, he muses &#145;do not doat upon Nan Marshal's acting therein, as the world talks of her excellence therein&#146;  (Pepys, 27 June 1668).<br>
<br>After 1668 Mrs Quin disappeared from the London stage until 27 November 1675, when she was listed again at the King's Company. However, no named roles are recorded for her until 24 March 1677, by which time she is acting for the rival, more successful, Duke's Company at Dorset Garden. Although we have no record of her earnings, financial considerations may well have played a part in her movement between companies. At Dorset Garden she excelled in comedy, playing the feisty Angelica in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span>, Lady Knowell in her <span class="italic">Sir Patient Fancy</span>, to which she also spoke the epilogue, Lady Squeamish in Otway's <span class="italic">Friendship in Fashion</span>, as well as an unrecorded part and the epilogue to John Banks's <span class="italic">The Destruction of Troy</span> (1679). In these troubled years records of Anne's performances are patchy and she does not appear again until May 1681 when she has returned to the King's Company to perform Queen Elizabeth in Banks's <span class="italic">The Unhappy Favourite</span>. She stayed with the troupe, creating one final role as Sunamire in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Loyal Brother</span> in February 1682. It seems that Anne did not perform with the United Company after its formation in 1682.<br>
<br>Anne's celebrity as a performer, in part linked to her attractive figure and dark-haired beauty, is suggested by the commercial representations of her, such as an engraving of her delivering the epilogue to <span class="italic">Sir Patient Fancy</span>. There is also a record of a remarkable miniature portrait on copper, misidentified as Nell Gwyn, with &#145;some thirty mica covers &hellip; upon which various head-dresses and costumes are painted&#146;, which can be overlaid to show Quin in a variety of her roles  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
