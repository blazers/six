<span class="headword">Tomlins,  Elizabeth Sophia</span>  (1763&#150;1828), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in London, the eldest of four daughters and second of (at least) five children born to Thomas Tomlins, esq. (<i>d</i>. 1815), a solicitor and clerk of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, and his wife, about whom nothing is known. One of her nephews was the publisher and playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27522/', "Frederick Guest Tomlins (1804&#150;1867)")</script>, who later succeeded his grandfather and uncle to the clerkship of the company.<br>
<br>With her elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27523/', "Sir Thomas Edlyne Tomlins (1762&#150;1841)")</script>, Tomlins co-published her first known work, <span class="italic">Tributes of Affection: with a Slave and other Poems</span>, by &#145;A Lady and her Brother&#146;. The collection includes sonnets, ballads, birthday pieces, and trifles, one of which provides a slight description of the woman herself. &#145;To Eliza; Gardening&#146;, signed by her brother (&#145;E&#146;) and dated 1790, mourns the waste of her maidenly personal attractions, a &#145;beauty and talent&#146; later corroborated by her obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1828. As a poet she is best known for &#145;The Slave&#146; (signed &#145;S&#146;), with its twin themes of personal liberty and politics in which the &#145;noble&#146; slave Quashi, on the point of gaining freedom, chooses suicide over revenge. Reflecting the political climate in England, other anti-slavery poems in the collection include &#145;Wilberforce&#146; and the closing poem, &#145;To the House of Commons, on their Vote for the Abolition of the Slave-Trade, April 2, 1792&#146;, signed by her brother. Eschewing the feminine tradition of writing exclusively of the personal, Tomlins's contributions incorporate the classical mode, along with a ballad trilogy of love, betrayal, and death, &#145;Connal&#146; (1782), &#145;Mary&#146; (1783), and &#145;Athol&#146; (1784), published also in &#145;Dr. Langhorne's collection&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 98).<br>
<br>As a novelist Tomlins's style shifted from early sentimentalism and didacticism to a post-1797 realism about deprivations of economics and personal freedom facing the working woman. Her first novel, <span class="italic">The Conquests of the Heart: a Novel. By a Young Lady</span> (1785), is a highly romanticized biography of a Jamaican friend, the subject of two poems, &#145;To R. N.&#146; and &#145;To the same Friend&#146;. The introduction to <span class="italic">Tributes of Affection</span> indicates that Tomlins and he (&#145;R. N.&#146;) collaborated on the novel. During the same period Tomlins wrote <span class="italic">The Victim of Fancy</span> (1787), published also as <span class="italic">La victime de l'imagination, ou, L'enthousiaste de Werther</span>, whose Goethe-inspired heroine Theresa Morven acts out her life (and death) like a character in the current fiction, such as Sophia Lee's <span class="italic">The Recess</span>, on which she feeds. Between 1780 and 1827 other writings included a translation of the history of Napoleon Bonaparte and many periodical essays  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 98). During the gap between her early and later canon (after 1797), Tomlins subsumed her personal &#145;advantages&#146; to her &#145;severe&#146; father's directives; she assumed the duties of governess to his &#145;innumerable&#146; children, in addition to attending his professional desk which she &#145;actually superintended&#146; during the final seven years of his life  (ibid.).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Rosalind de Tracey</span> (1798) and an earlier novel, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Baroness</span> (1792), while conventionally moralistic, also insert portrayals of the marginalized, especially the poor working woman. In a defence of the novel genre Tomlins claims to promote &#145;fortitude in affliction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rosalind de Tracey</span>, vi) and female friendship. Tomlins's novels feature the lone female character who ventures haplessly into public commercialized space. Like the Baroness D'Alantun, Rosalind undergoes abduction and violence in London, a venue for Tomlins's true-to-life vignettes of working women, such as governesses, and women lacemakers dying in squalid conditions as they ply their trade to bedeck the rich.<br>
<br>After her father's death in 1815 Tomlins moved to The Firs, a family cottage in Chalden, Surrey, with three sisters and their mother. Returning to her &#145;fascination&#146; with poetry, she had commenced a poem of &#145;considerable length&#146;, but, after falling from a pony on 7 August 1828, she died at Chalden in an &#145;apparent fainting fit&#146; on 8 August 1828  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 98), and was buried in the parish church there on 15 August.<br>
