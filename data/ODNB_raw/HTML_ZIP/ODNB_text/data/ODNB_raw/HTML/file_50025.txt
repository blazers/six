<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  John  fitz Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1213/14, <em>d.</em> 1261), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1213/14), probably with his wife, Sadhbh, a native Irishwoman. Thomas, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9574/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1176)")</script>, a leading participant in the conquest of Ireland, had established himself in the south-west, where he received ten knights' fees in Limerick from King John before his accession. Precisely when and how these acquisitions were enlarged is not clear, but by 1244 his son held much more extensively in Limerick and Kerry. He granted the church of Shanid (co. Limerick), where he had an important castle, to the cathedral of St Mary at Limerick; and he is said to have founded the Dominican priory of the Holy Cross at Tralee (Kerry) in 1243.<br>
<br>Fitz Thomas was under age at his father's death. His custody and marriage were granted to Thomas Fitzanthony, seneschal of Munster under King John and Henry III. By 1231 he was married to Margaret or Margery, one of Fitzanthony's five daughters. In 1235 he was among the magnates of Ireland urged to support Maurice Fitzgerald, the justiciar, in the aftermath of the murder of Richard Marshal. Like many barons of Ireland, he served Henry III on the expedition to Poitou and Gascony in 1242&#150;3. In 1244 he had a grant of free chase and warren in his Limerick and Kerry lands, and was summoned for the projected Scottish campaign. His activities in south-west Ireland at this period are poorly recorded, but he was clearly engaged in the warfare and alliances with Gaelic dynasties which were a normal part of maintaining and expanding lordship. In 1244 he executed Domnall Ruadh Mac Carthaigh, who had been handed over to him by his brother, Domnall Gall; and in 1252 he and his son, Maurice, killed Domnall Got Mac Carthaigh, the king of Desmond. His actions were not conducted in isolation from the English court. Throughout the 1250s he was assiduous in his attendance on Henry III and the Lord Edward, and seems to have been in England in 1250&#150;51, 1255, 1256, 1258, and 1259. His chief aim was to obtain a grant of the lordships of Desmond in Cork and the Decies in Waterford, together with the shrievalties of Waterford and Cork, which King John had given to his father-in-law. He succeeded in November 1259, when Edward awarded them to him in fee-farm, for 500 marks a year. This grant was a key foundation for the extensive claims of the earls of Desmond, but it remained vulnerable to challenges from the other coheirs of Thomas Fitzanthony, from the crown (since Henry III had forbidden Edward to make alienations), and from the Mic Charthaigh, who were now direct competitors of the Fitzgeralds for the lordship of Desmond.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life fitz Thomas was immensely powerful in south-west Ireland. He served as sheriff of Limerick and of Tipperary, as well as holding the shrievalties of Waterford and Cork (and apparently also of Kerry) in fee. His importance is reflected in the description of him in the annals of Inisfallen as &#145;seneschal of Munster and a great and noble baron&#146;  (Mac Airt, <span class="italic">Annals of Inisfallen</span>, 363). His career ended dramatically on an expedition with the justiciar of Ireland and other magnates into Desmond in July 1261, when he and his son were slain by Finghin Mac Carthaigh at Callann, near Kenmare (Cork). They are said to have been buried in the Dominican priory at Tralee. Rapid revenge was taken on the Irish by other settler lords; but the infancy of fitz Thomas's grandson and heir, Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1298), meant that the family's expansion lost its impetus for a time. This is visible in references to loss of value because of the &#145;war of the Irish&#146; in the extents of fitz Thomas's lands taken in 1282, after his heir came of age. Fitz Maurice followed his grandfather's example by combining military and diplomatic activity in south-west Ireland with the pursuit of influence in England, where about 1284 he married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Berkeley. In 1292 Edward I restored Desmond and the Decies to be held by him and his wife jointly, and in 1295 he served as deputy justiciar of Ireland. In 1329 his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9646/', "Maurice fitz Thomas Fitzgerald")</script>, became the first earl of Desmond.<br>
