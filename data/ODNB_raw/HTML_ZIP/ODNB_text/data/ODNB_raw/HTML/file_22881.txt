<span class="headword">Pullen,  William John Samuel</span>  (1813&#150;1887), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Lieutenant W. Pullen RN. After serving for some years in the navy he left it in 1836, and went out under the auspices of the South Australia Company to assist in the establishment of the colony, afterwards becoming marine surveyor under the colonial administration. Returning to the navy in 1844, he was appointed to the paddle surveying vessel <i>Columbia</i>, working on the Atlantic coast of Canada under Lieutenant P. F. Shortland. He was promoted lieutenant on 9 November 1846, but continued in the <i>Columbia</i> until she was paid off in 1848. He was then appointed to the <i>Plover</i> with Captain Thomas Moore for a voyage to the Pacific and the Arctic through the Bering Strait. In the summer of 1849 he and Hooper were ordered by Captain Kellett of the <i>Herald</i> to search the coast from Point Barrow to the mouth of the Mackenzie by boat, for signs of Sir John Franklin's expedition. After wintering on the Mackenzie, at Fort Simpson, in the following summer they searched the coast as far as Cape Bathurst, before returning to winter at Fort Simpson. They travelled overland to New York, and arrived in England in October 1851. Pullen had been promoted to the rank of commander, on 24 January 1850, and in February 1852 was appointed to the <i>North Star</i> for service in the Franklin search expedition under the orders of Sir Edward Belcher. The <i>North Star</i> spent the next two winters at Beechey Island, and returned to England in October 1854, having brought out Kellett and the crew of the <i>Resolute</i>. In the following January Pullen was appointed to the <i>Falcon</i>, attached to the fleet in the Baltic during the summer of 1855. On 10 May 1856 he was advanced to post rank, and in September 1857 was appointed to the <i>Cyclops</i> paddle steamer on the East India station. In 1858 he bombarded Jiddah and ran soundings down the Red Sea, with a view to laying telegraph cable from Suez to Aden; and throughout 1859 and 1860 he was employed on the survey of the south and east coasts of Ceylon. The <i>Cyclops</i> returned to England early in 1861, and from 1863 to 1865 Pullen was stationed at Bermuda, where he carried out a detailed survey of the island. From 1867 to 1869 he commanded the <i>Revenge</i> coastguard ship at Pembroke, and on 1 April 1870 was retired. He became rear-admiral on 11 June 1874, vice-admiral on 1 February 1879, and was granted a Greenwich Hospital pension on 19 February 1886. He had married a daughter of G. D. Berton, sheriff of Fredericton, Scotland; she predeceased him. He died at his residence, Vue Charmante, Torquay, Devon, on 11 January 1887.<br>
