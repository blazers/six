<span class="headword">Gotherson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Scott; <em>other married name </em>Hogben]</span>,  Dorothea</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher and writer</span>, was baptized on 22 September 1611 at Godmersham, Kent, the youngest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37945/', "Thomas Scott (c.1566&#150;1635)")</script>, later MP for Canterbury, and his second wife, Mary Knatchbull (<i>d</i>. 1616). According to her biographer, G. D. Scull, the Scotts could trace a lineage through the Scotts of Scot's Hall back to Edward I; Dorothea's great-grandfather was Thomas Wyatt the rebel. Although concerned about sin and mortality Dorothea remained aloof from any denomination during her early years. About 1635 she married Daniel Gotherson (<i>d</i>. 1666), later a major in Cromwell's army, and inherited her father's estate at Egerton, Kent, which returned nearly &pound;500 annually. Together they had five daughters and a son, Daniel.<br>
<br>Some time during the 1650s the Gothersons joined the Society of Friends. In particular Dorothea was drawn by their unity and devotion; in 1661 she reflected on life after her convincement: &#145;then began I to be led by the Spirit of God out of darkness into his marvellous light&#146;  (Scull, 8). She ministered to Friends in Kent where Thomas Lovelace was among her auditors: in a later deposition he noted that &#145;this Mrs. Gotherson had long been a great Quaker, and she had a particular congregation &hellip; which went under her maiden name of &#147;Scott's congregation&#148;, where he has heard her himself preach&#146;  (Scull, 6).<br>
<br>In 1661 Dorothea dedicated her Quaker tract, <span class="italic">To All that are Unregenerated, a Call to Repentence</span>, to the recently restored Charles II &#145;whom the Lord I believe hath set upon England's throne &hellip; that [he] mightst rule in righteousness&#146; and to whom she probably presented a copy. The work recognized Charles's divine authority and hoped he would not &#145;think it below him to read that which many think above me to write, in respect to my sex&#146;  (Scull, 79). She exhorted him to &#145;rule and reign&#146; in righteousness and pleaded with &#145;all people of England&#146; to &#145;turn to the Lord&#146;  (Scull, 81, 88). A work written by her husband, <span class="italic">An Alarm to All Priests</span> (1660), may well have been co-written by Dorothea.<br>
<br>It was at Whitehall in the early 1660s that the Gothersons encountered the adventurer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24890/', "John Scott")</script>, who claimed to be a descendant of the same Scott family as Dorothea. She believed him &#145;because some of Anchestors pictures were very like him&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A.175, fol. 147<i>r</i>). Scott soon gained the confidence of both Dorothea and Daniel, convincing them that he had lived among the natives of Long Island from whom he had purchased large tracts of land. By 1663 Daniel had mortgaged the Egerton estate to pay Scott &pound;2000 for land and houses on Long Island, and had entrusted the couple's son to Scott's care. When Daniel died about 1 September 1666 his will of the previous month left his Long Island holdings to family and friends, but Dorothea soon learned that neither Daniel nor Scott ever owned the Long Island land. In a petition to the king, probably written in 1668, she explained that she had been defrauded by Scott and that he had apparently &#145;exposed&#146; her son &#145;to work for bread&#146;; she asked that her case be referred to Francis Lovelace, the governor of New York  (Scull, 11). For the next several years she sought legal redress, citing her illustrious ancestry in her appeals at court. Scott was never brought to justice, but in 1679 his activities both in the colonies and on the continent brought him to the attention of Samuel Pepys, who collected a number of depositions against Scott, including that from Dorothea.<br>
<br>In 1670 Dorothea married Joseph Hogben of Kent, of whom very little is known. In 1680 she sold the Egerton estate to Sir James Rushout, and in the autumn she and her children sailed for an estate at Oyster Bay in Long Island which her first husband had bought in August 1633. Little is known of her life thereafter, though her daughter, also named Dorothea, married John Davis, a Quaker, shortly after they arrived, and moved to Salem county, New Jersey, about 1705.<br>
