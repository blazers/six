<span class="headword">Smith,  Leslie Charles</span>  (1918&#150;2005), <span class="occ">industrialist and toy manufacturer</span>, was born on 6 March 1918 at 26 Palace Gardens, Enfield, Middlesex, the son of Edward Arthur Smith, a journeyman joiner, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Niblett. After leaving Enfield central school at the age of fourteen he worked in London for J. Raymond Wilson, a die-casting company. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 he and his three brothers were advised by their father (who had served in the trenches in the First World War) to join the Royal Navy. Initially a signals rating, he was commissioned, commanding a torpedo boat during the Dieppe raid and a minesweeper during the D-day landings.<br>
<br>Demobilized with the rank of lieutenant, Smith and a former schoolfriend and service colleague, Rodney Smith (no relation), pooled their demobilization gratuities to buy a second-hand die-casting machine in January 1947. Under the trade name of Lesney Products, an amalgam of the two founders' first names, early production, mainly in zinc, included car engine parts and components for electrical firms. Soon the Smiths were joined by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98958/', "Jack Odell")</script>, an expert toolmaker with a penchant for model making. On 4 September 1948 Smith married Nancy Jackson-Moore (<i>d</i>. 1969), a 27-year-old secretary from Yorkshire, and daughter of Colin Trippett Jackson-Moore, maintenance worker. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Shortages of zinc arising from the Korean War briefly threatened the fledgling company's existence, a particular worry for Leslie Smith in view of his recent marriage. Rodney Smith was equally alarmed, withdrawing from Lesney in 1951. One delayed project was a large model of the state coach, but with zinc becoming more freely available again after the conclusion of the Korean conflict, a miniaturized version was produced as a coronation souvenir. Packed into a matchbox-style box, and offering high quality engineering at the low price of 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., it sold a million units by the end of 1953.<br>
<br>With Odell providing the design and engineering expertise, additional miniature models were developed under the trade name Matchbox. Yet it was Leslie Smith's commercial skills as managing director responsible for sales and marketing that underpinned the astonishing success of this product range. By 1960 Matchbox accounted for 80 per cent of Lesney sales and the company's first listing on the stock exchange was oversubscribed fifteen times, making both Smith and Odell millionaires. By 1968 sales were worth &pound;28 million worldwide, including in the United States, a market notoriously resistant to overseas penetration. In the same year <span class="italic">Management Today</span> placed Lesney at the top of its list of Britain's 200 most profitable companies, and Smith was appointed OBE. More aware, perhaps, than many contemporary toymakers of the importance of exports, he was a ready dispenser of advice on overseas marketing and, as sometime chair and president of the British Toy Manufacturers' Association, a consistent advocate of establishing a British international toy and hobby fair.<br>
<br>Smith's other major role at Lesney was in ensuring that labour relations remained harmonious, no mean achievement with a labour force that ultimately grew to some 6000, working in thirteen different factories. Always mindful of his own modest background (he never left Enfield), Smith took a close interest in the workforce, providing dedicated transport and creating a family-like working environment. Consequently he was initially reluctant to countenance offshore manufacturing as the world toy market grew progressively more competitive through the 1970s. Matchbox's success had attracted significant competition, and the first check to progress occurred in 1969 when Mattel launched its best selling Hot Wheels range in the United States. Almost overnight exports of Matchbox to America collapsed from 40 to 10 per cent of annual output. Several hundred workers were laid off and Smith took a 75 per cent pay cut to help the company regain lost ground. Although new product lines did recoup sales, earning the firm a fifth queen's award for industry in 1977, the necessary retooling was funded from substantially increased borrowing at a time of rising interest rates. A concurrent strategy of product diversification proved relatively unsuccessful. The purchase of ATM, an American plastic kit manufacturer, was particularly miscalculated. With levels of debt soaring under the impact of escalating interest rates, and strong sterling adversely affecting the overseas markets that accounted for 80 per cent of sales, Lesney ultimately found the burden unsupportable. Losses of &pound;3.6 million were recorded in 1980 and even the temporary return of Odell, who had retired as joint managing director in 1973, failed to halt the decline. In the summer of 1982 Lesney passed into the hands of the receiver, effectively ending Leslie Smith's industrial career.<br>
<br>In retirement Smith devoted himself to his three children and their families. Apart from his chairing two boards of school governors, the rest of his time was occupied with his garden and yachting. However, both the magnitude of his achievement in creating from scratch a world-leading die-cast toy company and his wider contribution to the British Toy and Hobby Manufacturers' Association were acknowledged in 1998 when he received the association's lifetime achievement award. He died at his home, 9A Broad Walk, Winchmore Hill, Enfield, on 26 May 2005, of pleomorphic liposarcoma. He was survived by his three children.<br>
