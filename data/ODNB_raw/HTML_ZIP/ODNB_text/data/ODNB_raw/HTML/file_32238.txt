<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caine,  William Sproston</span>  (1842&#150;1903), <span class="occ">politician and temperance advocate</span>, born at Egremont, Wallasey, Cheshire, on 26 March 1842, was the eldest surviving son of Nathaniel Caine JP (<i>d</i>. 1877), metal merchant, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of William Rushton of Liverpool. Educated privately at Gibson's school, Egremont, and the Revd Richard Wall's school at Birkenhead, Caine entered his father's business at Egremont in 1861, and in 1864 was taken into partnership. He moved to Liverpool in 1871. Public affairs soon occupied much of his attention, and he retired from the firm in 1878. He retained, however, the directorship of the Hodbarrow Mining Co. Ltd, Millom, and he secured the controlling interest in the Shaw's Brow Iron Co., Liverpool, leaving the management of the concern in the hands of his partner, Arthur S. Cox. The collapse of this business in 1893 involved Caine in heavy liabilities, which he honourably discharged, but thenceforth his resources were largely devoted to paying off the mortgage which he raised to meet the firm's losses.<br>
<br>Caine's father was raised a Wesleyan but joined the Baptists on his marriage; Caine was brought up as a Baptist under the influence of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3611/', "Hugh Stowell Brown")</script>, whose memorial volume he edited (1887). On 24 March 1868 he married Alice, Stowell Brown's daughter; they had two sons and three daughters. He developed early a bent for preaching and philanthropic work. In later life in London he was from 1884 to 1903 the lay pastor of a mission church known as the Wheatsheaf in Stockwell, south London, but he was largely preoccupied with the temperance movement, and at Liverpool he found his first scope for propagandist zeal. As president of the Liverpool Temperance and Band of Hope Union, he formed and became chairman of a Popular Control and License Reform Association, with a monthly organ, the <span class="italic">Liverpool Social Reformer</span>. In 1873 he was elected vice-president of the United Kingdom Alliance. He was also president of the Baptist Total Abstinence Society, the Congregational Temperance Society, the British Temperance League, and the National Temperance Federation.<br>
<br>In 1873 Caine first sought election to parliament, mainly with a view to enforcing his temperance views. He was in general agreement with the radical wing of the Liberal Party, and unsuccessfully contested Liverpool for the Liberals in both that and the next year. In 1880 he was returned as radical member for Scarborough, and without delay he urged on the House of Commons his advanced temperance opinions. In a maiden speech on 18 June 1880 he supported the successful motion of his friend, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, in favour of local option. Identifying himself with the extreme radical section of the party, he seconded Henry Labouchere's motion of dissent from Gladstone's proposal for a national monument to Lord Beaconsfield (12 May 1881). His activity was officially recognized by Gladstone on 17 November 1884 by his appointment as civil lord of the Admiralty in succession to Sir Thomas Brassey. Although he retained his seat at the necessary by-election, he was defeated in Tottenham at the general election of 1885. He soon, however, returned to the house as MP for Barrow in Furness at a by-election on 6 April 1886.<br>
<br>Caine declined to accept Gladstone's home-rule policy, and took an active part in organizing under Chamberlain's direction the dissentient Liberals into a new party of &#145;Liberal Unionists&#146;. In the division on the second reading of Gladstone's <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> (7 June) Caine and Henry Robert Brand (afterwards second Viscount Hampden) acted as tellers for the ninety-three Liberal Unionists, who brought down the government. The home-rulers gave the new party the sobriquet of the &#145;Brand of Caine&#146;. At the ensuing general election Caine was again returned for Barrow, and was appointed chief Liberal Unionist whip. But his radical convictions and extreme temperance views, which were unaltered, soon rendered the alliance with the Conservatives distasteful. Although the scheme of G. J. Goschen in 1890 for compensating holders of extinguished public-house licences was modified under pressure from Caine, he marked his dislike of it not only by resigning his post of whip but by vacating his seat in the house. On seeking re-election at Barrow as an independent Liberal he was defeated. Within the same year he rejoined the Liberal fold, and in 1892 re-entered the house for East Bradford as a Gladstonian Liberal and voted for the 1893 <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>. At the general election of 1895 he lost his seat, and only re-entered the house in 1900 as Liberal member for Camborne. In the interval he sat on Lord Peel's royal commission on the liquor-licensing laws (1896&#150;9), and signed the minority report and the addendum in favour of direct local veto.<br>
<br>The native population of India also engaged Caine's sympathies, and he criticized severely British methods of government, especially the encouragement for fiscal purposes of the liquor and opium trade. In 1890 he visited India as a delegate to the Indian National Congress at Calcutta, and contributed to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> a series of letters called &#145;Young India&#146; which ably advocated large measures of self-government. He sat on the royal commission of 1895&#150;6 on the administration of Indian expenditure, signing the minority report recommending a diminution of civil and military expenditure, and would, but for ill health, have sat on the opium commission.<br>
<br>Caine's activities exhausted his strength. A voyage to South America in 1902 failed to restore his health, and he died of heart failure on 17 March 1903 at his home, 42 Grosvenor Road, Westminster, London. He was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Woking. Caine was a puritan in politics and religion, whose moral courage and philanthropic instincts were superior to his intellectual gifts. Abrupt in manner, downright in speech, but of imperturbable good humour, he was dubbed by political associates the &#145;genial ruffian&#146;.<br>
