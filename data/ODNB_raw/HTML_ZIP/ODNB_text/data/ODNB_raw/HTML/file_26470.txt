<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Donald Martin</span>, first baronet  (1824&#150;1900), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Mount Pleasant, near Forres, Moray, on 1 March 1824, the son of Robert Stewart of Forres and his wife, a daughter of the Revd Donald Martin, minister of Abernethy, Strathspey, Scotland. Educated at schools at Findhorn, Dufftown, and Elgin, and at Aberdeen University, where he distinguished himself in classics, he entered the East India Company's service as ensign in the 9th Bengal native infantry on 12 October 1840. He was promoted lieutenant on 3 January 1844 and captain on 1 June 1854. He married, in 1847, Marina, daughter of Commander Thomas Dymock Dabine RN, who survived him with their two sons and four daughters. The eldest son, Norman Robert, the second baronet (1851&#150;1926), colonel in the Indian staff corps, served with distinction under his father; the second son, Captain Sir Donald William (1860&#150;1905), was British resident at Kumasi.<br>
<br>Stewart served in the expeditions on the Afghan frontier&#151;the Mohmand expedition in 1854 and the Aka Khel and Basi Khel in 1855&#151;and was mentioned in dispatches. In 1857 he was at Aligarh, where his regiment, the 9th Bengal native infantry, mutinied on 20 May. He then took command of a small body of volunteers and went to Agra, whence he voluntarily carried dispatches through rebel territory, arriving at Delhi on 29 June. Lord Roberts commented: &#145;It was a marvel that he ever reached Delhi&#146;  (Roberts, vol. 1, appendix I). On reaching Delhi he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general to the Delhi field force, and served with distinction to the end of the siege and in the capture of the city. He was then appointed assistant adjutant-general to the Bengal army and took part in the siege and capture of Lucknow and in the campaign in Rohilkhand. He was mentioned in dispatches and received a brevet majority on 20 July 1858.<br>
<br>Stewart continued assistant adjutant-general of the Bengal army until 1862, when he was made deputy adjutant-general and took a prominent part in the reorganization of the Indian army. He was promoted brevet colonel on 20 July 1863, and lieutenant-colonel on 12 October 1866. In 1867 and 1868 he commanded with the rank of brigadier-general the Bengal brigade in the Abyssinian expedition. He showed considerable ability in organization and transport. He commanded at Senafe throughout the campaign, was mentioned in dispatches, and was made a companion of the Bath. On his return to India he was appointed to the frontier divisional command of Peshawar with the rank of brigadier-general. He was promoted major-general on 24 December 1868. In July 1869 he was sent by Lord Mayo to the Andaman Islands to reorganize the convict settlement there, which Mayo hoped would make the islands self-supporting. He was made sole commandant with autocratic powers. The results were so encouraging that Mayo visited the settlements in 1872, when he was assassinated by a convict. The subsequent investigation exonerated Stewart; nevertheless, the tragedy so shocked him that he was obliged to go to Europe on sick leave.<br>
<br>Stewart returned to India in 1875, and in April 1876 was appointed to command the Lahore division. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877. In the Second Anglo-Afghan War he commanded the Quetta army in October 1878, marched through the Bolan and Khojak passes, dispersed the enemy in a cavalry action at Saif-ud-din, with only one squadron of the 15th hussars and part of the 1st Punjab cavalry, entered Kandahar, and also occupied Kalat-i-Ghilzai and Girishk in January 1879. He received the thanks of parliament and was made a KCB. On 30 March 1880 he set out to march to Kabul through a country deserted and without resources, defeated the Afghans at Ahmed Khel on 19 April and at Arzu on 23 April, and reached Kabul on 1 May, taking over the command from Sir Frederick Roberts on the following day. His combined force was now styled the northern Afghanistan field force. Having seen the new amir, Abdur Rahman, formally recognized, Stewart was preparing to leave the country when at the end of July he learned of the Maiwand disaster, and he ordered Roberts with 10,000 men to Kandahar. He himself returned to India in August with the rest of the troops by the Khyber route. For his services he was awarded the thanks of parliament and the grand cross of the Bath, and was created a baronet. He was appointed military member of the viceroy's council on 18 October 1880, but, on 7 April in the following year, succeeded Sir Frederick Haines as commander-in-chief in India, and occupied the post until the end of 1885, when he returned home.<br>
<br>Stewart accepted a seat on the Council of India on 16 December 1885, which he held until his death. He was made a companion of the Indian Empire on 24 May 1881, promoted general on 1 July 1881, decorated with the grand cross of the Star of India on 7 December 1885, and appointed governor of Chelsea Hospital on 9 March 1895. In 1889 he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Aberdeen. He was a member of the royal commission on Indian civil and military expenditure. He was promoted field marshal in May 1894. He died at Algiers on 26 March 1900. He was modest and able to speak plainly without offending. He was a keen genealogist and fisherman, and visited Canada frequently for salmon fishing in the waters of his old schoolfellow, Lord Mount Stephen.<br>
