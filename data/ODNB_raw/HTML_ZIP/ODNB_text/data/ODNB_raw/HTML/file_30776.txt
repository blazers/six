<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aylmer, Sir  Felix</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Felix Edward  Aylmer Jones]</span>  (1889&#150;1979), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 21 February 1889 at Alexander House, Corsham, Wiltshire, the second child in the family of five sons (one of whom died as a child) and one daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward Aylmer-Jones, Royal Engineers, and his wife, Lilian Cookworthy. He was educated at Magdalen College School and Exeter College, Oxford, where he took second classes in both mathematical moderations (1909) and physics (1911). After an undergraduate attachment to Oxford University Dramatic Society he decided to join the stage, to his parents' displeasure.<br>
<br>Aylmer began a course of stage training under the celebrated teacher Rosina Filippi. His first professional appearance was as a two-line Italian stooge with E. Seymour Hicks at the Coliseum in 1911, just after his twenty-second birthday. He then appeared in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> at the New Theatre and in two memorable Shakespearian productions by Harley Granville-Barker in 1912 at the Savoy. In 1913 he joined the company of Barry Jackson at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. This splendid training was interrupted by the First World War, in which Aylmer served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, hurrying back to the Birmingham stage and his wife as soon as hostilities had ceased. During the war he had married Barry Jackson's niece Cecily Minnie Jane (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of Robert Taaffe Byrne, managing director of the Leyland of Birmingham Rubber Company. They met when he played Prospero to her Miranda and after the war they appeared together again as Sir Peter and Lady Teazle. They had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>During the following years Aylmer was seen in many West End plays, including <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> by George Bernard Shaw (Kingsway, 1926) and <span class="italic">The Flashing Stream</span> (Lyric, 1938). He also appeared in plays in New York, such as <span class="italic">Loyalties</span> by John Galsworthy (Gaiety, 1922), produced by Basil Dean, and <span class="italic">The Last of Mrs Cheyney</span> by Frederick Lonsdale (Fulton, 1925). Some of his greatest successes were in the parts of members of the professions of law and diplomacy. For John Drinkwater in 1928 he played at the Royalty a king's counsel in the long-running comedy <span class="italic">Bird in Hand</span> by Drinkwater. This was followed by the role of a councillor of state in <span class="italic">Jew S&uuml;ss</span> adapted from Lion Feuchtwanger's novel <span class="italic">Jud S&uuml;ss</span> (Duke of York's, 1929), and then that of a crooked solicitor in the 1934 revival at the Sadler's Wells and the Shaftesbury of <span class="italic">The Voysey Inheritance</span> by Harley Granville-Barker. He was also the judge in Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> (Haymarket, 1956). Diplomats that he played included the foreign office official in the 1954 production of <span class="italic">The Spider's Web</span> by Agatha Christie.<br>
<br>Aylmer was not fond of Shakespeare. He once confided:<blockquote>I am a bit of an anti-Shakespearian. I acknowledge his greatness, of course&#151;but, you know, Shakespeare has done so much harm to actors. He has been responsible for so much work that is artificial and unreal that in my time he has seemed a machine for manufacturing ham actors who do not understand the psychological contents of the parts and the poetry. Everyone has to do Shakespeare if they want to make a reputation but it seems to me that they seldom do their best work in his plays. He stretches an actor's emotional range, of course&#151;but then so do Ibsen and Strindberg. (private information)</blockquote>Aylmer preferred G. B. Shaw, whom he first met very early in his career. He played in Shaw repeatedly and indeed appeared in three different parts in <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> alone.<br>
<br>Not one to enthuse about the rapport normally enjoyed by stage actors with a live audience, Aylmer preferred the medium of the film. He claimed that the work the film actor had to do, under the close-up of the camera's pitiless eye, called for a greater skill than anything required on stage. He appeared in a number of supporting parts in large-scale films for American directors: Plautius, a Roman converted to Christianity, in <span class="italic">Quo vadis?</span> (1951); Isaak of York, the Jewish father of Elizabeth Taylor's Rebecca in <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1953); Merlin to Mel Ferrer's King Arthur in <span class="italic">Knights of the Round Table</span> (1953); and, in spite of his antipathy to Shakespeare, two memorable performances in productions by Laurence Olivier, namely Polonius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1948) and the Archbishop in <span class="italic">Henry V</span> (1944). Television too brought him fame: he appeared with Hugh Griffith in the popular comedy series entitled <span class="italic">The Walrus and the Carpenter</span>, and as Father Anselm with Derek Nimmo in <span class="italic">Oh Brother!</span>, a successful series about life in a monastery.<br>
<br>In 1959 he published a book, <span class="italic">Dickens Incognito</span>, in which he outlined the controversial argument&#151;now fully accepted&#151;that Dickens had an affair with Nelly Ternan, a young actress. Although Graham Storey conclusively rebutted its suggestion that they had a child who was given for adoption, Claire Tomalin has praised &#145;the originality and cleverness of the other part of Aylmer's detective work&#146;  (Tomalin, 302). The book created a sensation. However, the bubble burst within a week as other Dickens lovers pounced on a flaw in his argument and found gaps in his research. Contemporary criticism might have humiliated a lesser man but it was met by Aylmer with rueful amusement and perfect sang-froid. He was not deterred from writing a second book, <span class="italic">The Drood Case</span>, which was published in 1964.<br>
<br>Aylmer gave great service to his profession as an outstanding president of the British Actors' Equity Association from 1949 to 1969. In his official capacity, he criticized in 1963 the dirty and insanitary conditions still existing even in some West End theatres. He was also vice-president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art when the principal, John Fernald, resigned in 1965 after a disagreement on policy with the council. In 1950 Aylmer was appointed OBE for his services to the stage, and in 1965 he was knighted.<br>
<br>Having spent some time in Germany as a student, Aylmer later translated a number of plays from German. One of his favourite hobbies was composing limericks, clerihews, and verse for newspaper competitions. In this he vied with his son Ian, and together they won several prizes. His daughter, Jennifer, was for several years connected with the British Theatre Museum in London. A stroke precipitated Aylmer's retirement to his country house near Cobham, where he continued to live until shortly before he died, at a nursing home, Crann Mor, Pyrford, Surrey, on 2 September 1979.<br>
