<span class="headword">Beaver,  Stanley Henry</span>  (1907&#150;1984), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 11 August 1907 at 69 Clifford Gardens, Willesden, London, the second son and fifth child in the family of two sons and three daughters of William Henry Beaver, Post Office letter sorter, and his wife, Hypatia Florence Hobbs. He was educated at Kilburn grammar school (1919&#150;25), and at University College, London (1925&#150;8) where he gained a first-class honours degree in geography (1928) and the Morris prize in geology. After a course of teacher training he was appointed in 1929 to the staff of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). He quickly earned a high reputation as an economic geographer and collaborated with L. Dudley Stamp in writing the successful <span class="italic">The British Isles</span> (1933). Beaver's studies concentrated on the mineral, manufacturing, and transport industries. He contributed <span class="italic">Yorkshire, West Riding</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">Northamptonshire</span> (1943) to Stamp's <span class="italic">Land of Britain</span>. On 5 August 1933 at Battersea parish church he married Elsie Barbara (1908/9&#150;1992), daughter of William Wallace Rogers, chief traveller for the Jaeger Company. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war Beaver's knowledge proved valuable to the geographical section of the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty: he worked at Cambridge, 1941&#150;3, especially on western and south-eastern Europe, on railway matters, and afterwards occasionally contributed to the <span class="roman">Geographical Handbooks</span>. In 1943 he joined the Ministry of Town and Country Planning in the research division working on mineral problems and derelict land, and developed the collection of air photographs. He continued to advise the ministry after his return to academic life as Sir Ernest Cassel reader in economic geography at the LSE in 1946. As exemplified by his <span class="italic">Derelict Land in the Black Country</span> (1946), based on field survey, and by his work on minerals (notably ironstone) and planning, Beaver made contributions of lasting policy significance. His studies of sand and gravel resources were particularly influential at a time of strong demand for wartime construction purposes (such as airfields) and for post-war urban reconstruction and new town development. He contributed pioneer studies of the reclamation of industrial waste land. He was a member of the Waters advisory committee on sand and gravel from 1946. In 1950 Beaver was appointed to a foundation chair in the University College of North Staffordshire at Keele and threw his energies wholeheartedly into the development of the University of Keele (1962). He was chairman of the grounds committee. He founded a climatological station and produced (with E. M. Shaw) <span class="italic">The Climate of Keele</span> (1971). He wrote vividly on the evolution of the industrial landscape of the Potteries. Through his efforts the library of Air Ministry wartime air photographs, mainly of Europe, was placed on permanent loan at Keele in 1963 and opened in 1966. He also secured for Keele the Le Play House Library and the archive of the Institute of Sociology.<br>
<br>Fieldwork which threw light on the relationships between environment, economy, technical skills, and social conditions lay at the heart of Beaver's work as a geographer. He had been early attracted to the work of the Le Play Society and took part in field surveys, for example in Bulgaria, Albania, and Norway. He joined societies to serve them, not for recognition. His work for the North Staffordshire Field Club was recognized by his election to its presidency, 1961&#150;2. A founder member of the Institute of British Geographers, he was president in 1964. The Geographical Association elected him to its presidency in 1967 and he was twice president of section E of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1961, 1981). He served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society (1943&#150;7) and received its Murchison award in 1962. He was chairman for many years of the Dudley Stamp Memorial Trust. He was elected an honorary fellow of the LSE in 1982. He was elected also to honorary membership of the Geographical Society of Poland. He maintained strong international links and gained pleasure from translating into English a number of salient works by French geographers. Nearer home, chairmanship of the Staffordshire Community Council occupied time and energy.<br>
<br>Beaver was short, spare, and energetic. His mind was quick: he did not enjoy long committee discussions. He loved railways and knew his Bradshaw. He was a kind man, though when principles were at stake he could speak sharply. He had what was described as a &#145;pungent humour&#146;. He enjoyed teaching and students responded to his enthusiasm. A central theme was the environmental consequences of technical change. He linked a grasp of geological conditions, detailed knowledge of places, reading in economic history, and an understanding of industrial technologies to analyse the revolution in the British landscape that had resulted from industrial change. Technical development, he argued, did not lead to mastery over nature but rather to increasingly interdependent relationships between societies and environments. Beaver died on 10 November 1984 at his home, The Mount, Stafford Road, Eccleshall, Staffordshire. His work on industrial land reclamation was a starting point of a process which is still in train and much recent work in economic geography, though it deals with knowledge-based rather than manufacturing industry, has similar objectives to his.<br>
