<span class="headword">Prichard,  Harold Arthur</span>  (1871&#150;1947), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in Kilburn, London, on 30 October 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard, solicitor in Bedford Row, and his wife, Lucy Withers. He was educated at Clifton College, and at New College, Oxford, of which he was a mathematical scholar. He was placed in the first class in mathematical moderations (1891) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1894) and was university mathematical exhibitioner in 1892. In 1894 he was articled to a firm of solicitors in the City of London, but he remained there only a few months. He was a fellow of Hertford College from 1895 to 1898, and of Trinity College from 1898 to 1924. In 1899 he married <a href="#cosubject_53017">Mabel Henrietta Ross [<i>see below</i>]</a>, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>After many years of devoted service to Trinity Prichard retired by reason of temporary ill health. In 1928 he was elected White's professor of moral philosophy, which carried with it a fellowship of Corpus Christi College; he retired on reaching the age limit in 1937 and was made an honorary fellow of the college. He was elected FBA in 1932, and received the honorary degree of LLD from Aberdeen University in 1934.<br>
<br>Prichard wrote very little for publication, but much in order to clear his own mind, to elicit the opinions of his friends, and to help them in their own philosophical problems. The only book he published was <span class="italic">Kant's Theory of Knowledge</span> (1909). He had accepted from John Cook Wilson, for whom he had the greatest admiration, the realistic view which had begun, in Oxford as elsewhere, to prevail over the Kantian and Hegelian views hitherto in the ascendant. He combined with a great respect for Kant the conviction that at bottom Kant's view is an unsuccessful attempt to mediate between realism and idealism. Prichard's book contains, therefore, both a clear and detailed analysis of Kant's view and a vigorous argument against it. Knowledge, he maintained, is an activity entirely <i>sui generis</i> and incapable of being interpreted in terms of anything else. Having expressed this view in his book, he did not return to the theory of knowledge in later writings except in his lectures, published in the posthumous volume <span class="italic">Knowledge and Perception</span> (1950), on the theories of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. With regard to perception, he expressed in his book on Kant the view that the appearing of bodies to minds is, like knowledge, an unanalysable fact, both when it corresponds to reality and when it does not. But his mind remained open on the subject; he dealt with it in four papers published in the posthumous volume, and in the last of them, &#145;The sense-datum fallacy&#146; (1938), he expressed the view that the unanalysable fact is best stated as &#145;some-one-seeing-a-colour&#146;, &#145;some-one-hearing-a-sound&#146;, and so on, the colour or sound having no separate existence.<br>
<br>In 1912 Prichard published in <span class="italic">Mind</span> a paper which has had a significant and enduring influence on ethical thought: &#145;Does moral philosophy rest on a mistake?&#146;. Just as in his book on Kant he had argued in general that there can be no theory of knowledge which supplies an answer to the question &#145;Is what we have hitherto thought to be knowledge really knowledge?&#146;, so he argued here that there is no theory which will prove that what we have thought to be obligations really are so; to attain this certainty we have simply to think harder about the facts. To this he added the thesis that while the rightness of an act depends on the nature of the situation in which we are and on the change the act will originate, the goodness of an act depends on its motive. To this view he supplied an important addendum in a British Academy lecture, &#145;Duty and ignorance of fact&#146; (1932), by arguing that since being obliged is an attribute of a person, what makes an action right or wrong for the individual is not the objective situation but the agent's opinion about the situation, and, further, that what he is obliged to do is not to produce a certain change, but to set himself to produce it. Prichard was much pressed to state his view at full length, and he made considerable progress with the negative part of the task, the refutation of the most important existing theories; the result is to be found in the long paper called &#145;Moral obligation&#146; included in the posthumous book of the same name (1949), which includes also several shorter papers dealing with important ethical problems.<br>
<br>Prichard was a great teacher, and he had great influence among his fellow teachers at Oxford and elsewhere. &#145;A post-prichardian, reading his views for the first time in full, may well be amazed how many of the commonplaces of contemporary Oxford philosophy have their origin in his work&#146;, wrote R. M. Hare, reviewing two works by him in 1950  (<span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>, 558). Prichard combined unhesitating conviction of what he considered the fundamentals in philosophy with great readiness to examine over and over again detailed problems both about perception and about obligation. Severe on what he regarded as obvious error in others, he was at least equally critical of himself, modest about his own work in philosophy, and never satisfied with what he had done. In controversy he was formidable, in social intercourse friendly and interested in the interests of his friends. In his work as a tutor, as a professor, and in the Second World War as an air-raid warden, he was conscientious almost to a fault. Physically he was short and slight, but vigorous; as an undergraduate he played lawn tennis for Oxford against Cambridge, and he remained until near the end devoted to golf. He died at his home, 6 Linton Road, Oxford, after a short illness, on 29 December 1947.<br>
<br>He was survived by his wife, <a name="cosubject_53017"></a><span class="headword">Mabel Henrietta Prichard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ross]</span></span>  (1875&#150;1965)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in India on 17 February 1875, the daughter of Surgeon-Major Charles Grant Ross of the Bombay army. She was brought up in England and was educated at Liverpool high school and Royal Holloway College before going to Oxford as a member of the Society of Oxford Home Students, gaining a second in classical moderations followed in 1897 by a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>. She spent a year as a lecturer in classics at Westfield College, London, before her marriage in 1899. As well as keeping house for her husband's undergraduate reading parties during vacations and entertaining his pupils, she undertook much unpaid work for women's education at Oxford as honorary treasurer of the Association for the High Education of Women, and, from 1911 to 1948, of the Society of Oxford Home Students (which became in 1942 St Anne's Society and in 1952 St Anne's College, of which she was elected an honorary fellow).<br>
<br>Mabel Prichard was best known for her voluntary welfare work in the city of Oxford. In the early twentieth century she was among a group of dons' wives who pioneered infant welfare work. In 1922 she was elected a university representative on Oxford city council, becoming an alderman in 1932, and she was a city magistrate. She had a particular interest in mental health, and an occupational centre at Littlemore Hospital was named after her. As well as serving on the Oxford Council of Social Service, she was chairman of the Citizens' Advice Bureau and of Skene House, the latter concerned with the moral welfare of young women. For her public services she was appointed OBE; in 1964 she became the first woman to be made an honorary freeman of Oxford. She died in St Luke's Nursing Home, Linton Road, Oxford, on 14 March 1965.<br>
