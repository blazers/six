<span class="headword">Ogle,  Robert (II)</span>  (<em>c.</em>1305&#150;1362), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was head of a Northumberland family that had held Ogle in the barony of Whalton since the mid-twelfth century. Because for seven generations the eldest son was named Robert there are difficulties attributing exploits to the correct individual. Robert Ogle or his father, Robert (I) (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1280), acted as messenger for stocking Mitford Castle in August 1318. Similarly one or other was pardoned in 1329 by Edward III for acts committed in the late rebellion (of Henry, earl of Lancaster). Robert the son married first Isabel Fernielaw, after whose death he married in 1331 Joan Heppale, whose father settled on them half the manor of Hepple and other land in mid-Coquetdale. In 1335 he was a commissioner of array both in Northumberland and in the regalian liberty of Hexhamshire, where he was bailiff. This was revoked in May in respect of Newcastle, where the community had agreed with the king to serve at sea against the Scots. Meanwhile Robert was amassing land throughout the county. In May 1341 Edward III granted him as &#145;king's yeoman&#146; licence to crenellate his house at Ogle, with free warren in all his demesnes. The same year he was one of the commissioners to assess and levy the ninth in Northumberland. Whether he was responsible for an assault on the army of David II, king of Scots, that was laying siege to Newcastle in November 1341, has been doubted. In May 1344 he was commissioned to array the men of Northumberland against the Scots, renewed in April 1345.<br>
<br>It may have been this Robert Ogle, or more likely his son with Isabel Fernielaw, Robert (III), who participated in the defence of Cumberland in 1345 with the bishop of Carlisle and Sir Thomas Lucy, and served as seneschal of Annandale for William de Bohun, earl of Northampton and constable of Lochmaben. It was the elder Robert who was thanked by Edward III for his part in the battle of Nevilles Cross on 17 October 1346 and commissioned to bring down to the Tower of London Scottish prisoners captured there. These included the earl of Fife, Henry Rameseye, and Thomas Boyd, whom he was reputed to have captured personally. Conjointly with Robert Bertram, father-in-law to his son, he was also to deliver John Douglas, brother to the earl. (There is a tradition that after the battle the captive King David was taken to Ogle's castle at Ogle by John Coupland, who then refused to surrender his prisoner until favourable financial terms were offered.) On 10 December 1346 Robert Ogle senior was ordered to attend a council at Westminster to consider business concerning the state of England and war in Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1355 he was in charge of Berwick, under Lord Greystoke, where his son, Robert (III), was killed in the attack whereby the Scots captured the town but not the castle. Robert (III) had married Elena, the heir of Robert Bertram of Bothal, when his father settled half the manor of Hurworth-on-Tees on him and his wife. Robert (II) died on 16 June 1362, and his widow was given dower in Thursby in Cumberland. She and her second husband, John Phillipot, secured custody of the heir, Robert (IV), grandson of Robert (II). This Robert married the youngest coheir of Sir Alan Heton of Chillingham, and was a conservator of the truce between England and Scotland in 1386; his chantry chapel and tomb in Hexham Priory still survive. He settled on his second son, John, the Bertram barony of Bothal, being his grandmother's inheritance. This was disputed by the elder brother, Robert (V), who, after their father's death in 1409, laid siege to Bothal Castle with 200 armed men and archers and captured it. John petitioned in parliament for restitution and recovered possession. The barony remained in his family until a failure of male heirs in the 1470s, when it reverted to the senior line.<br>
