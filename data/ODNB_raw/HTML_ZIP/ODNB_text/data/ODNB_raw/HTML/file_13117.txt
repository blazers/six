<span class="headword">Hervey,  John</span>, first earl of Bristol  (1665&#150;1751), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 27 August 1665, and baptized there on 29 September of that year. He was the second son of Sir Thomas Hervey (1625&#150;1694), MP for Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1686), the daughter of Sir Humphrey May, vice-chamberlain of the household to Charles I. He was educated at the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds and then at Clare College, Cambridge, where he matriculated on 5 July 1684. He did not take his degree but was awarded an LLD by the university on 16 April 1705.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1688 Hervey married Isabella (1670&#150;1693), the daughter of Sir Charles Carr, bt, MP and landowner. According to Robert Halsband, the marriage was &#145;extraordinarily happy&#146; and produced three children, two daughters and one son, <a href="#cosubject_13110">Carr Hervey [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Isabella died giving birth to their second daughter on 7 March 1693. On 27 May the following year his father&#151;his &#145;best and dearest friend&#146;&#151;also died, and Hervey inherited his estates and the office of high steward of Bury St Edmunds. He held this position as well as being deputy lieutenant of Suffolk, to which he had been appointed two years earlier (10 May 1692), and, from March 1694, one of the MPs for Bury St Edmunds.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1695 Hervey married his second wife, Elizabeth Felton (1676&#150;1741), the daughter of Sir Thomas Felton (later Lord Felton), MP for Playford Hall, Suffolk, and Elizabeth Howard, the daughter and coheir of the third earl of Suffolk. His marriage to Elizabeth, whom he described as his &#145;ever-new Delight&#146;, produced seventeen children. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13116/', "John Hervey (later Lord Hervey)")</script>, became a courtier in George II's household, and their second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13119/', "Thomas Hervey")</script>, became an MP and pamphleteer. A younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68307/', "Henry Hervey Aston")</script>, became a poet and Church of England clergyman.<br>
<br>Hervey's parliamentary and constituency career was diligent if not spectacular. Before his father's death in 1694 he appears to have adopted his family's moderate toryism, though&#151;possibly under the influence of his second father-in-law, Thomas Felton&#151;he switched his sympathies to the whigs and thereafter came into contact with powerful patrons such as John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, and his wife, Sarah. The expectation, voiced in February 1702, that Hervey was to become a Treasury commissioner ended with Anne's accession later that year.<br>
<br>Hervey continued to serve as MP for Bury St Edmunds until 23 March 1703, when he was created Baron Hervey of Ickworth in the county of Suffolk. An earlier Hervey barony had become extinct on the death of William, Baron Hervey of Kidbrooke, in June 1642. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 22 June 1703, a position that owed much to the political intrigue of the duke and duchess of Marlborough. In the Lords he proved to be a staunch whig, and an eager supporter of the revolution of 1688 and the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>. Hervey displayed his support for the Hanoverians and his dislike of the tories in a number of ways: the ordering of medals of the elector and his family, his hosting of a dinner in honour of the recently disgraced duke of Marlborough, and his opposition to the treaty of Utrecht drafted by the tory government. At the accession of the elector he was created earl of Bristol (19 October 1714).<br>
<br>Lord Bristol's links with the king were broken by the royal split in November 1717, when he supported the prince of Wales. Early in the following year his wife, who was a friend and correspondent of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, was appointed one of the ladies of the bedchamber to Princess Caroline. In the 1720s Bristol was an opponent of the Walpole government, and in March 1733 spoke in favour of a reduced standing army. His anti-Walpole stance led him to oppose the political position of his son John, while still defending him against the personal attacks made by William Pulteney and Alexander Pope.<br>
<br>His closeness to John was in contrast to the often strained relations between Bristol and his son from his first marriage, <a name="cosubject_13110"></a><span class="headword">Carr Hervey</span>, Lord Hervey  (1691&#150;1723)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 17 September 1691, and educated at Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1710. In the following year he embarked on a grand tour, which included a meeting with Marlborough in Flanders and an introduction to the elector of Hanover. He was elected MP for the borough of Bury St Edmunds. Following the accession of George I he was granted the courtesy title of Lord Hervey, and was appointed one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales, whom he followed into opposition in 1717. To Horace Walpole he was the &#145;elder brother of the more known John, Lord Hervey, and reckoned to have superior parts&#146;. However, his life was clouded by scandal. Writing in the 1830s Lady Louisa Stuart maintained that Carr was the true father of Walpole, a claim countenanced by the <span class="italic">DNB</span> but for which there is no contemporary evidence and which most probably derived from Stuart's hostility to Walpole. Carr continued to sit as an MP until March 1722, when, on account of his neglecting his parliamentary duties, he was defeated. He died at Bath, unmarried, in debt, and, in his father's words, &#145;drowned in drink&#146;, on 14 November 1723, aged thirty-two, and was buried on 24 November at the church at Ickworth, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Away from politics, the first earl of Bristol was a keen trainer and breeder of racehorses at his Newmarket stud. John Macky described him as &#145;a great sportsman, lover of Horse-matches and play &hellip; a handsome Man in his Person, fair complexion, middle stature, Forty years old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services of J. Macky</span>, 1733). His character was also sketched by Queen Caroline and John, Lord Hervey, in the third volume of his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Bristol was in addition an accomplished author and scholar, and his diary (1688&#150;1742) and family correspondence (1651&#150;1750), including occasional verse and his father's letters, were published in 1894. Bristol's wife died on 1 May 1741, aged sixty-four. He himself died on 20 January 1751 and was buried at Ickworth church on 27 January.<br>
