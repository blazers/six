<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Henry Hugh</span>  (1826&#150;1883), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5652/', "Hugh Charles Clifford, seventh Baron Clifford of Chudleigh (1790&#150;1858)")</script>, and Mary Lucy (1799&#150;1831), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28987/', "Thomas Weld")</script> of Lulworth Castle, Dorset, was born on 12 September 1826 at Irnham Hall, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Prior Park, near Bath, Stonyhurst College, and the University of Fribourg, and commissioned as a second lieutenant in the rifle brigade on 7 August 1846. He served in South Africa, fighting in the Cape Frontier War (1846&#150;7), and then against the Boers at the battle of Boomplaats (29 August 1848). On the outbreak of a war against the Basuto in 1852 he again went to Africa, where he was present at the battle of Berea Mountain (20 December 1852). He left in November 1853. He also served in the Crimean War, and was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel Sir George Buller, brigade commander in the light division. He was present at Alma and Inkerman, and for his bravery at the latter was awarded the Victoria Cross. In May 1855 he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general, and remained in the Crimea until the end of the war. He was then promoted brevet major, and awarded the l&eacute;gion d'honneur and the Mejidiye (fifth class). He married on 21 March 1857 Josephine Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1913), only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/582/', "Joseph Anstice")</script> of Madeley Wood, Shropshire, professor at King's College, London; they had six daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>Clifford was sent to China on the outbreak of hostilities, and as assistant quartermaster-general was present at the operations between December 1857 and January 1858 which resulted in the capture of Canton (Guangzhou). For his services he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel. On his return to England he began a long term of service on the staff; he was assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot (1860&#150;64) and at headquarters (1865&#150;8), aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge (1870&#150;73), and assistant adjutant-general at headquarters (1873&#150;5). In April 1879 Clifford was sent by Cambridge to South Africa to reorganize army transport and repair relations between the military and civil authorities. He was successful in this task, although his own relationship with the field commander, Lord Chelmsford, was frosty. His labours were fully acknowledged by Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was gazetted a CB on 2 June 1869 and a KCMB on 19 December 1879, and was major-general of the eastern district of England from April to September 1882. Sir Henry died of cancer at his home, Ugbrooke Park, near Chudleigh, Devon, on 12 April 1883, and was buried at the chapel there.<br>
