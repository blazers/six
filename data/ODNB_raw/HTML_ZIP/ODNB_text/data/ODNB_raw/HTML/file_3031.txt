<span class="headword">Bowdler,  John</span>  (1746&#150;1823), <span class="occ">Church of England layman and religious writer</span>, was born at Bath, Somerset, on 18 March 1746, the eldest son of Thomas Bowdler (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. 1785) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74743/', "Elizabeth Stuart Bowdler, n&#233;e Cotton (d. 1797)")</script>, religious writer. He was given a strict Anglican religious upbringing by his mother, and at the age of eight was sent to the school kept by Mr Graves at Claverton, near Bath. For unknown reasons he was moved to an academy at Brompton, Middlesex, where he struggled with Greek but learned much about accountancy. In 1762 he was placed under the private tuition of the Revd Nicholas Brett, of Spring Grove, Wye, Kent, only surviving son of the Revd Thomas Brett, the celebrated nonjuring divine. On his death, in 1776, Brett left his pamphlets (many on the nonjuring controversy) and papers to Bowdler. <br>
<br>In November 1765 Bowdler entered the London legal office of Mr Barsham, a special pleader. Between 1770 and 1780 he engaged in the study of law, practising as a chamber conveyancer. During these years his closest friend, or soulmate, was Robert Cobb of Lydd, Kent, with whom he delighted to engage in lengthy discussions of law and theology. He was the victim of frequent bouts of serious ill health during this period. On 28 January 1778 he married Henrietta, eldest daughter of John Hanbury, vice-consul of the English factory at Hamburg, and his wife, the sister of Thomas Lawrence (1711&#150;1783), physician and friend of Dr Johnson. They had ten children, six of whom survived infancy. They included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3033/', "Thomas Bowdler the younger (1782&#150;1856)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3030/', "John Bowdler (1783&#150;1815)")</script>. Bowdler's elder sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3029/', "Jane Bowdler")</script> died in 1784. On his father's death, in May 1785, Bowdler inherited a small family fortune, which enabled him to retire from the legal profession and move from London to Kent, first, on a seven-year lease, to a house adjacent to Knowle Park, in Sevenoaks. In 1793 he moved from Sevenoaks to Pickhurst Farm, in the parish of Hayes, near Bromley, and finally, about 1806, he moved to Eltham. <br>
<br>Bowdler became part of a distinguished coterie of Anglican high-churchmen that included John Bowles, Charles Daubeny, William Stevens, and, later, Joshua Watson and others. Looking back to the theology of the Laudian and later Caroline divines and nonjurors they emphasized the apostolical authority and descent of the Church of England and the paramountcy of church unity, as well as the divine-right basis and patriarchal rather than contractual origin of the state. Bowdler can be placed in that tradition of high-church Anglican lay spirituality associated with the name of the one-time nonjuror Robert Nelson (1656&#150;1715), of whose devotional writings he was a fervent admirer. Most of his friends were associated with a nucleus of London high-churchmen commonly known as the Hackney Phalanx. Many of them were also members of an influential high-church Anglican dining club known as the Club of Nobody's Friends, founded by the layman William Stevens, the original &#145;nobody&#146;, in 1801. Bowdler was an intimate friend of Stevens and attended him on his deathbed, in 1807. <br>
<br>Bowdler &#145;admired the principles of the Nonjurors, and held their memory in great veneration&#146; but was &#145;never disposed to follow them to the extent to which some of them carried those principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 79). None the less he appears not to have doubted the validity of later nonjuring consecrations, and he was in close attendance, in November 1779, on Robert Gordon, the last of the nonjuring bishops, through a fatal illness. He was a firm opponent of the principles of protestant dissent and strongly disapproved of the Anglican evangelical Sir Richard Hill's <span class="italic">An Apology for Brotherly Love</span> (1799) for its partial justification or extenuation of dissent. Though he declined an offer to review it Bowdler warmly approved Charles Daubeny's uncompromisingly high-church <span class="italic">Guide to the Church</span> (1798), with its strictures on the sin of schism, against which Hill's <span class="italic">Apology</span> was a low-church response. He recommended the publishing of an abridgement of the <span class="italic">Guide</span>, &#145;in order to procure for it a more general perusal&#146;  (ibid., 165). Bowdler planned, but did not complete or publish, his own defence of Daubeny's <span class="italic">Guide</span> and critique of the Methodists and Hill's <span class="italic">Apology</span>&#151;a move that was also partly occasioned by the publication of the moderate evangelical William Wilberforce's highly influential <span class="italic">Practical View of the Prevailing System of Professed Christians</span> (1797). Bowdler also corrected drafts of Daubeny's follow-up &#145;Letters to Sir Richard Hill&#146;, published as <span class="italic">Appendix to the Guide to the Church</span> (1799), although the author complained that Bowdler had carried the principle of &#145;removing everything harsh-sounding&#146; &#145;a little too far&#146;  (Daubeny to Boucher, 22 Feb 1799, Boucher MS B/5/6). <br>
<br>Bowdler's high-church principles also found expression from 1806 in his growing interest in, and support for, the once persecuted and downtrodden episcopal church in Scotland, and he became an active member of a committee formed to raise subscriptions for it. His attempts to place the Church of England and the non-established Scottish episcopal church on an apparently equal ecclesiastical footing were privately criticized even by the moderate high-church bishop of Bangor, John Randolph, who complained that Bowdler's view on the subject had &#145;not a little spice of the nonjuror in it&#146;  (Randolph to Thomas Lambard, 15 Feb 1807, Randolph papers, Bodl. Oxf., MS top. Oxon. d.356, vol. 6, 50<i>v</i>). <br>
<br>Bowdler was an outspoken and stern moralist and a fierce critic of the social and moral ills of contemporary society. His high-church defence of the spiritual rights of the church co-existed with withering denunciations of economic abuses and moral irregularities and strictures on clerical dancing, card-playing, and sabbath profanation that matched those of his Anglican evangelical contemporaries. In 1796, in published addresses to the archbishop of Canterbury, he proposed that those found guilty of adultery be rendered infamous and incapable of marrying and inheriting land. He also recommended that gaming be punished by imprisonment and new laws introduced to enforce public observance of the Lord's day. Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, responded sympathetically but regretted that several of Bowdler's remedies for moral evils were impracticable and could not be enforced. In 1797 Bowdler again sought to expose what he regarded as the immorality and irreligion of the nation with a strongly worded and lengthy pamphlet, <span class="italic">Reform or Ruin: Take your Choice</span>. He enunciated the doctrine of apostolic succession but was scathing about what he regarded as abuses in the contemporary church and state. At the root of his panaceas for economic, social, and ecclesiastical reform lay a belief that conduct and principles had first to be reformed. <br>
<br>It is significant that Bowdler's rigid high-church principles did not preclude him being on close terms with prominent Claphamite evangelicals, notably Henry Thornton and his wife, whom he commended for their &#145;parental&#146; kindness towards his own son John  (<span class="italic">Select Pieces</span>, xx). His own style of churchmanship and spirituality is evident, nevertheless, in the fear that he expressed in his memoir of his son (published in 1816), that readers might suspect that the younger John Bowdler's &#145;piety bordered on enthusiasm&#146;. He made clear his own position: <blockquote>Although no one can be less disposed than myself to become the advocate of enthusiasm, properly so called, for I well know the dangers which attend it, and the dreadful consequences to which it leads; yet, bad as it is, its opposite is surely worse. (ibid., xvii)</blockquote>The generosity of Bowdler's charitable benefactions was legendary. He was particularly generous in his support for church-building; he was an early advocate of church extension and of the better provision of church accommodation of the poor, and in 1813 responded with enthusiasm to a letter from the banker and Hackney Phalanx ally William Cotton, suggesting the foundation of a church building society. Bowdler helped to form the committee that in 1815 lobbied the bishop of London and then, in 1816, the government, to erect additional churches in the populous parts of England out of public funds. The Church Building Society, formed in July 1817 and formally launched in February 1818, was the fruit of these endeavours. Bowdler was at the forefront of plans to raise &pound;1 million by subscription. He admired Daubeny's appropriation of seatings for the poor at Christ Church, Bath. However, in view of Victorian high-church associations with rich church decoration and furnishings his recommendation of a &#145;simple, chaste&#146; style of building &#145;free from all useless or expensive decoration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 252) is significant in the light of later perceptions of high-churchmanship. <br>
<br>Bowdler was an early riser and a man of strict devotional habits, being particularly assiduous in the practice of family prayers. He was zealous and could be stern, formidable, and overbearing in his dealings with others, but he also possessed a warm, affectionate personality and made friends easily. As a young man he excelled in boxing, fencing, and horsemanship; he was also an excellent arithmetician and an early advocate of decimalization. His daughter Elizabeth died on 4 December 1810, followed by his son the poet John Bowdler on 1 February 1815. Bowdler developed dropsical symptoms in his last days, and died at Eltham on 29 June 1823, of a &#145;slight paralysis of the lower abdomen, followed by water effusion&#146;. He was buried at Eltham church, in a vault adjacent to his old friend Bishop George Horne. He was outlived by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3032/', "Thomas Bowdler (1754&#150;1825)")</script>, famous as the author of the expurgated, or &#145;bowdlerized&#146;, <span class="italic">Family Shakspeare</span> (1818), and by his younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3028/', "Henrietta Maria Bowdler")</script>, who originated it.<br>
