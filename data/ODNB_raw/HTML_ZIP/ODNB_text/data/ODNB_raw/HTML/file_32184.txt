<span class="headword">Burne, Sir  Owen Tudor</span>  (1837&#150;1909), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator in India</span>, was born at Plymouth on 12 April 1837, the eleventh of the nineteen children of the Revd Henry Thomas Burne (1799&#150;1865), and his wife, Knightley Goodman (1805&#150;1878), daughter of Captain Marriott, Royal Horse Guards. In 1835 his father had converted from the Church of England to the Holy Catholic Apostolic church, founded by Edward Irving, in which faith his children were brought up. His eldest brother was Colonel Henry Burne, and another brother, Douglas, was manager of the Bank of Bengal.<br>
<br>Burne was educated at home by his father, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in the 20th (East Devonshire) regiment (later the Lancashire Fusiliers) on 15 May 1855, and served for several months at its depot at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight before joining his regiment in the Crimea, in charge of a draft of 200 recruits, on 3 April 1856, following the cessation of hostilities. In June he returned home, and after a year at Aldershot, on 5 August 1857, embarked for India to assist in suppressing the uprising there. After it landed at Calcutta, in November 1857, his regiment was sent to Oudh to deal with mutinous Sepoys gathered between Benares and Lucknow. As Burne had learnt Hindustani aboard ship, he was given a staff appointment as brigade major to Brigadier Evelegh, commanding a brigade in the 4th infantry division (Brigadier Franks). Burne first saw action on 19 February 1858 at Chanda, near Sultanpur in Oudh, where several artillery pieces were captured from the enemy; after several difficult engagements, on 4 March his division joined Sir Colin Campbell's army besieging Lucknow, which was held in strength by the rebels. His brigade was initially deployed under heavy fire in outworks near the Dilkusha palace on the outskirts of the city, where it was exposed to a heavy fire. For a feat of gallantry on 11 March, when Burne carried out a dangerous reconnaissance mission to discover the whereabouts of units deployed on the flanks of his brigade and during which he rallied some shaken Nepalese troops, he was unsuccessfully recommended for promotion and for the Victoria Cross. When the 4th division attacked the <i>kaisarbagh</i> and <i>imambara</i>, the keys of the enemy's position, on 14 March, Burne was brigade major of the attacking column, and was one of the first to enter the gate of the heavily defended <i>kaisarbagh</i>. Until Lucknow fell on 21 March Burne participated in the heavy fighting in the city. On 10 April 1858 he was promoted lieutenant and served with Evelegh's brigade, engaged in clearing the country near Lucknow of rebels in spite of widespread outbreaks of cholera and the intense heat. Burne later rejoined as adjutant the 20th regiment, which now formed part of Sir John Campbell's field force operating in northern Oudh. He served in 1859 as a staff officer with Brigadier Holdich's column in the final operations in Oudh under Sir James Hope Grant's command. Burne was mentioned in dispatches on several occasions, received the medal with clasp for Lucknow, and was later promoted captain (9 August 1864) and brevet major (January 1865) for his services in the uprising.<br>
<br>Burne's efficiency as adjutant while the 20th (East Devonshire) regiment was stationed at Goudah greatly impressed Sir Hugh Rose, the commander-in-chief in India, when he inspected the regiment on 14 December 1860. Despite his low rank Burne was unexpectedly appointed Rose's military secretary the following spring. Although this appointment was later confirmed in England, as a result of friction between the duke of Cambridge, the commander-in-chief there, and Rose over the choice of such a junior officer, Burne resigned his post at the end of 1862; he was instead appointed Rose's private secretary. He occupied this post during the debate about reconstruction of the Indian army following the uprising of 1857, and participated in various consultations between Rose and Lord Canning. During these deliberations Burne demonstrated his administrative ability and detailed knowledge of the military profession. Burne accompanied Rose when he returned to England at the end of his tenure as commander-in-chief in India, and then to his new command in Ireland where he became one of his aides-de-camp. For his assistance in suppressing the 1867 Fenian conspiracy Burne received the thanks of the government. On 20 November 1867 he married Evelyne, daughter of Francis William Browne, fourth baron of Kilmaine; the couple had three sons and two daughters. His first wife died on 22 April 1878 and on 9 August 1883 he married Lady Agnes Charlotte Douglas, youngest daughter of the nineteenth earl of Morton.<br>
<br>Burne returned to India in December 1868 as private secretary to Lord Mayo, the newly appointed viceroy, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship and whose political views he shared. Burne was with Mayo during a visit to the Andaman Islands when on 6 February 1872 the viceroy was assassinated by an Afridi convict. He briefly remained at Calcutta as private secretary to Lord Napier and Ettrick, governor of Madras, who temporarily acted as viceroy, but departed for England when Lord Northbrook arrived in May 1872.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1872 Burne was created a CSI and early in August he visited Queen Victoria at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, to give a personal report on the exact details of Mayo's death. Also in August he was appointed to the new post of political aide-de-camp to the duke of Argyll, secretary of state for India. His duties included overseeing all visiting Indian dignitaries and embassies and advising the India Office generally on its dealings with the Indian people. In the summer of 1873 he assisted Sir Henry Rawlinson in entertaining the shah of Persia during his visit to England. In April 1874 Burne was appointed assistant secretary to the foreign department of the India Office, which was generally responsible for overseeing British India's external relations, both in Asia and in Europe. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 16 July, and in October succeeded Sir John Kaye as secretary and head of the foreign department. In this capacity he wielded considerable personal influence, and he closely consulted with the marquess of Salisbury, secretary of state for India, on central Asian and Afghan questions.<br>
<br>Burne returned to India in April 1876, and served for two years as private secretary to Lord Lytton, the new viceroy. The successful ceremonial proclamation of Queen Victoria as empress of India at the imperial assemblage at Delhi on 1 January 1877 was in large part due to Burne's work, although he was primarily interested in Afghan and central Asian policy. A year later, on 1 January 1878, Burne was created a CIE. He returned to England shortly afterwards as his wife was ill. Lytton wrote to him: &#145;You have done for me, and been to me, all that one man could have done or been.&#146; Burne returned once again to the India Office in February and was promoted KCSI in July 1879; shortly afterwards he reached the rank of colonel. From 1879 he regularly contributed to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, as well as writing several magazine articles and books on British India. In 1880 Burne helped negotiate a highly satisfactory settlement for the Indian exchequer with the nawab nazim of Bengal, and supervised the affairs of Maharaja Duleep Singh. Burne joined the Council of India&#151;an advisory body to the secretary of state composed of men with extensive experience of the subcontinent&#151;in December 1876, and was promoted major-general in 1886. In 1894 he retired from the army, although he continued to work, and served as vice-president of the Council of India in 1895 and 1896. He finally retired from this post on 31 December 1896, when he was also made a GCIE.<br>
<br>Following his retirement, Burne was busily occupied in various philanthropic, mercantile, and other public work, acting as chairman of the council of the Society of Arts (1896&#150;7) and as a member of the advisory committee of the Board of Trade (1903). He died after a long illness at his home, 132 Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale, London, on 3 February 1909. He was buried with military honours six days later at the priory church, Christchurch, Hampshire. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
