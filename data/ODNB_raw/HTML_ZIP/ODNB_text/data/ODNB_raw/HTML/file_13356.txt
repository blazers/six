<span class="headword">Hinton,  John Howard</span>  (1791&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and theologian</span>, was born on 24 March 1791 in Oxford, where his schoolmaster father was the minister for thirty years. James Hinton (1761&#150;1823) was one of those Baptist leaders who, at the end of the eighteenth century, secured the revival of Baptist life in Britain. His wife, Ann (1765&#150;1832), was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27032/', "Isaac Taylor (1730&#150;1807)")</script>, the engraver, a member of an important Congregational family. John Howard was so named by his mother at the request of John Howard, the prison reformer, after the loss of his own son.<br>
<br>After secondary education in his father's school, Hinton studied medicine with an Oxford surgeon. Influenced by John Sutcliffe and Andrew Fuller, his father's close friends in the work of the infant Baptist Missionary Society, and called by the church in Oxford to ministry, Hinton entered Bristol Baptist college in 1811 for training, but in 1813 proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA in April 1816. He married, in 1818, Eliza, only daughter of the Revd Isaiah Birt, then minister of Cannon Street Chapel, Birmingham. They had two sons; the younger was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13354/', "James Hinton")</script>, ontologist and writer on philosophy.<br>
<br>Following a first pastorate at Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire (1816&#150;20), Hinton moved to Reading (1820), where he led his congregation into more prestigious premises in the King's Road, which established Hinton's reputation as a denominational leader. In 1837 he succeeded Thomas Price, the editor of the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, as minister of the historic Devonshire Square Chapel in the City of London, where he remained until 1863. He was both a formidable writer on theological topics (which he undertook in the context of a busy London pastorate, rather than with the support of any academic community) and an activist in a large number of important religious societies.<br>
<br>A keen campaigner against slavery, it was Hinton who proposed a divisive motion seeking to exclude slave holders from membership of the infant Evangelical Alliance in 1846. He was a lecturer for Joseph Sturge's Complete Suffrage Union and was also active in the Christian Instruction Society, using its platform to argue against Owenism. He helped found the Liberation Society, or the Anti-State Church Society as it was first called, and earned a reputation as the most distinguished of the society's lecturers; for it he wrote <span class="italic">The Test of Experience, or, The Voluntary Principle in the United States</span> (1851). With other Baptists, however, he withdrew from the work of the society after 1855, troubled by the increasing aggressiveness of Edward Miall. His voluntary church principles led him to attack in print the education clauses of Graham's <span class="roman">Factory Bill</span> of 1843. Temperance, with its built-in tendency towards intervention once education into temperance was shown to be an unrealistic hope, led him in later life to become critical of absolute voluntarism in all aspects of life: he defended government initiatives in social legislation and underlined the need for Christian ministers to combat class distinctions, arguing that labour and capital were properly to be seen as joint partners in the creation of wealth. An evangelicalism shared with many Anglicans made him an enthusiastic supporter of the Evangelical Alliance, though he was bitterly critical of new ritualistic developments within the established church.<br>
<br>In 1841 Hinton became secretary of the Baptist Union, a post then vacant because of the resignation of Joseph Belcher who was unhappy with having to communicate the British union's censure of American Baptists who owned slaves. Hinton, who edited <span class="italic">The History and Topography of the United States</span> (2 vols., 1830, 1832), was, by contrast, clear in his hostility to slavery. In his new position, which he held for a quarter of a century, Hinton found himself in the ironic position of being a complete individualist seeking to engineer the unity of a group of independent churches, but his obituarist was fair in his judgement that the Baptist Union &#145;owed its preservation in times of comparative feebleness to his perseverance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Baptist Hand-Book</span>).<br>
<br>Hinton sat on the committee of the Baptist Missionary Society, for which he wrote <span class="italic">A Vindication of Christian Missions in India</span> (1826) and a <span class="italic">Memoir of William Knibb</span> (1847), but he was uncertain whether the missionaries or the London committee should determine mission strategy and action. He came to believe that missionaries should not create dependent churches but should move on swiftly to open up new areas of work, always remembering that much missionary work remained to be done in Europe. Hinton himself visited Holland, Germany, and Sweden in support of the newly planted Baptist Missions in these countries. In 1840 one of the leaders of the Baptists in Germany, G. W. Lehmann of Berlin, travelled to London to be ordained by him.<br>
<br>Full of enthusiasm for Jonathan Edwards and the New Divinity revivalism which Edwards stimulated, Hinton saw the development of church life in the USA as abundant corroboration of free-church principles. Hinton was sometimes regarded as the successor to Andrew Fuller as the leading moderate Calvinist among the Baptists, but his attempts to secure a new synthesis in the Calvinist&#150;Arminian debate were less than satisfying, leading him into unsatisfactory teaching on human responsibility and original sin, for which the rationalism of his Edinburgh education may be in part to blame. In his <span class="italic">The Work of the Holy Spirit in Conversion</span> (1829) he sought to provide a theology of revivalism, but in its endeavour to release human capacity from the old shackles of a theology of inability it went too far, fatally limiting the work of the Spirit in maintaining that &#145;a sinner has power to repent without the Spirit&#146;. Such a controversial affirmation, enunciated by the occupant of one of the Particular Baptists' historic London pulpits, was one reason for the establishment of the London and East Anglian associations of Strict Baptist churches outside the Baptist Union. A strenuous advocate of personal evangelism, however, Hinton became seriously worried by the drift from historic orthodoxy among the Congregationalists. In 1860 he joined with Charles Haddon Spurgeon in opposing Baldwin Brown's <span class="italic">Divine Life in Man</span>, upon which he published strictures, characterizing Brown's thinking as &#145;the first inroad into English Nonconformist churches of a theology totally deficient in the truth and power of the gospel&#146;  (C. H. Spurgeon, <span class="italic">Autobiography of C. H. Spurgeon</span>, 1899, 2.269).<br>
<br>Hinton retired from Devonshire Square in 1863 and the Baptist Union in 1866, and returned to Reading, where he founded the new Carey Chapel. He twice occupied the chair of the Baptist Union, in 1837 and 1863. In 1868 he moved to 1 Redland Terrace, Bristol, where he died on 17 December 1873, having the previous year represented the Baptist Union at a service in St Paul's Cathedral to give thanks for the recovery of the prince of Wales. He was buried on 22 December in Arnos Vale cemetery, Bristol.<br>
