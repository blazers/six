<span class="headword">Gish <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gash]</span>,  Sheila</span>  (1942&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Sheila Anne Syme Gash, at Bromhead Maternity Home, Lincoln, on 23 April 1942, the only daughter and elder child of Major Ivan Henry Gash, an officer in the East Lancashire regiment, and his wife, Margaret Elsie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Millar. At the time of the registration of her birth her parents lived in Welton, Lincolnshire. Her early years were spent in Germany, the Sudan, and Egypt. At the age of twelve she was sent to the Royal School for Daughters of the Officers of the Army, a boarding-school in Bath. She went straight from school to study as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and (with the stage name Sheila Gish) began her professional life in repertory theatres, including Birmingham and Pitlochry, where she met her first husband, the actor Roland Kingsford Curram (<i>b</i>. 1932), son of Bernard Kingsford Curram, who worked in insurance. They were married at Holy Trinity Church, Stratford upon Avon, on 12 December 1964. They had two daughters, <a href="#cosubject_97049">Lou Gish [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Kay Curram (<i>b</i>. 1974), both of whom followed their parents into acting.<br>
<br>Gish's first role in the West End was as Bella in <span class="italic">Robert and Elizabeth</span> at the Lyric Theatre in 1964, a musical adaptation by Ronald Millar and Ron Grainer of <span class="italic">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</span>. The following year she made her film d&eacute;but, alongside her husband, in <span class="italic">Darling</span> (1965), directed by John Schlesinger and starring Julie Christie, both of whom became lifelong friends. Her early career was spent largely in comedic roles, and in 1975 she made a notable West End appearance alongside Pauline Collins and John Alderton in Alan Ayckbourn's five short plays that made up <span class="italic">Confusions</span>, for which she won the Clarence Derwent award as best supporting actress. In 1977 she was cast as the fading southern belle in the West End production of Tennessee Williams's New Orleans-set <span class="italic">Vieux Carr&eacute;</span> at the Piccadilly Theatre, but late cuts to the text made her feel that her role had been compromised, and she left the production shortly after the opening night, amid much press attention.<br>
<br>While playing the title role in Christopher Fettes's production of Racine's <span class="italic">Berenice</span> (1982) at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, Sheila Gish was finally recognized as a major actress. Dressed simply in a Fortuny gown, on a smoked-mirrored set, she was riveting as Racine's love-consumed queen, disintegrating in despair. Her performance was a revelation, with a complete vocal mastery of Racine's alexandrines, and a depth of passion that surprised some people, but as she said &#145;I've worked for this step by step. I'm ready for more&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 March 2005). That same year her delicate beauty was perfect for Chekhov's Yelena in <span class="italic">Uncle Vanya</span> at the Haymarket, but despite a glossy cast (which included Donald Sinden, Frances de la Tour, Ronald Pickup, and Harry Andrews) the production was not a success. In 1983 she returned to Tennessee Williams, when she played Blanche DuBois in Alan Strachan's production of <span class="italic">A Streetcar Named Desire</span> at the Greenwich Theatre, despite attempts by Williams's wilfully protective and eccentric editor, Maria St Just (thinking she was wrong for the part and perhaps remembering their previous encounter on <span class="italic">Vieux Carr&eacute;</span>), to prevent her. She gave a moving and original performance, portraying all of Blanche's fragility, vulnerability, and tenderness, but combined with a formidable intelligence and self-awareness. She was &#145;almost a figure of Greek tragedy, relentlessly pursued by the Furies&#146;  (ibid.). Her affinity with Williams's work was unusual in a British actress.<br>
<br>Gish then played in a revival of Osborne's <span class="italic">A Patriot for Me</span> (1983) with Alan Bates at Chichester, directed by Ronald Eyre, and made her National Theatre d&eacute;but in Tom Stoppard's adaptation of Molnar's <span class="italic">Rough Crossing</span> (1984). She and Curram were divorced in 1985, but that same year she met and fell in love with the actor Denis Lawson (<i>b</i>. 1947), the son of Laurence Lawson, watchmaker and jeweller. Meanwhile her stage successes continued: she played Celia in a West End revival of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span> (1986) with Alec McCowen, directed by John Dexter; convinced completely as Isadora Duncan in Martin Sherman's <span class="italic">When She Danced</span> (1989) at the King's Head; was perfectly cast as Mrs Prentice in <span class="italic">What the Butler Saw</span> (1990); and played Clytemnestra to the Electra of Fiona Shaw in Deborah Warner's production of <span class="italic">Electra</span> at the Riverside Studios (1991).<br>
<br>On returning to the National in 1993 Gish scored a huge success as Yvonne, the monstrous mother to Jude Law in Sean Mathias's production of Jean Cocteau's <span class="italic">Les parents terribles</span>, and was rightly disappointed to lose the role to the more &#145;starry&#146; Kathleen Turner when the production was staged on Broadway. At the Donmar Warehouse she gave an acclaimed performance as Joanna, the raddled alcoholic, in Sam Mendes's hugely successful production of Stephen Sondheim's <span class="italic">Company</span> (1995), deservedly winning an Olivier award as best supporting actress in a musical, and challenging the memory of that role's creator, Elaine Stritch, with her desperate and funny rendition of &#145;The Ladies who Lunch&#146;. She then returned to the Riverside Studios to play Racine's Phaedra (2002), again directed by Christopher Fettes, and scored once more in Tennessee Williams, as Violet Venable, the terrifying matriarch in <span class="italic">Suddenly Last Summer</span> (1999).<br>
<br>Film and television were never to offer Gish the same kind of opportunities as the theatre, but she had a good role in the film of Peter Nichols's <span class="italic">A Day in the Death of Joe Egg</span> (1972), and shone alongside Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, and Isabelle Adjani in the Merchant&#150;Ivory film of Jean Rhys's <span class="italic">Quartet</span> (1981). She made her television d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Z Cars</span> in 1968, and later appearances included roles in <span class="italic">The First Churchills</span> (1969), in two adaptations of Kingsley Amis novels, <span class="italic">That Uncertain Feeling</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">Stanley and the Women</span> (1991), as an outrageous opera diva in an episode of <span class="italic">Inspector Morse</span> (1993), and as Nancy Mitford's Lady Montdore in <span class="italic">Love in a Cold Climate</span> (2001).<br>
<br>Gish loved the theatre and knew it was her element. She was a serious and dedicated actress whose theatrical career was neatly divided in two. After the early years largely spent in comedy and farce, she then had a triumphant second half as a tragedienne, playing &#145;women on the verge of breakdown&#151;and women long past the verge, women ravaged, women in a frenzy, tortured and torturing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 12 March 2005). These included Racine's Berenice and Phaedra, Williams's Blanche and Violet Venable, Cocteau's Yvonne, and Sondheim's Joanna. In 2003 the director Steven Pimlott asked her to play Arkadina in his production of Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> at the Chichester Festival Theatre. By this time Gish had been stricken with a rare facial cancer, and when her illness led to corrective surgery and the removal of her right eye, she offered to withdraw. However, Pimlott suggested she play the role with an eye patch, and Gish rose magnificently to the challenge, giving an immensely brave and heartbreaking performance. Her daughter Kay appeared alongside her as Masha, the only time they were to act together. It was Gish's last stage role.<br>
<br>Gish faced her illness with great courage, surrounded by family and friends. She worked once more, in a BBC radio production, partly recorded in her home, of two short pieces, <span class="italic">Roman Fever</span> by Edith Wharton, and one final Tennessee Williams, <span class="italic">Something Unspoken</span>. In March 2004 she and Denis Lawson married, in Antigua. She died on 9 March 2005 at Edenhall Nursing Home, Camden, London, of cancer, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. She was survived by her husband, Denis, and her daughters.<br>
<br>Gish's elder daughter, <a name="cosubject_97049"></a><span class="headword">Louise Mikel Henrietta Marie Curram</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Lou Gish]</span>  (1967&#150;2006), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in London on 27 May 1967. She was educated at Macaulay Church of England primary school in Clapham, Furzedown School in Wandsworth, Alleyn's School in Dulwich, and Camberwell School of Art. She then worked in a variety of jobs (including as assistant to the theatrical agent Jeremy Conway) before embarking on a career as an actress. Her first professional role was in Grigory Gorin's <span class="italic">Forget Herostratus!</span> at the White Bear Theatre, Kennington. Subsequent stage roles included Helen Carver in Sean Mathias's revival of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Design for Living</span> at the Donmar Warehouse (1994), Marge in Phyllis Nagy's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's <span class="italic">The Talented Mr Ripley</span> at the Watford Palace (1998), Ann in Denis Lawson's production of David Halliwell's <span class="italic">Little Malcolm and his Struggle against the Eunuchs</span> at the Hampstead Theatre and subsequently in the West End (1998&#150;9), Helena in John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> at the Bristol Old Vic (2001), and the title role in John Webster's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span> at the Salisbury Playhouse (2002). In each of these roles she was applauded by critics for her intelligence and her ability convincingly to portray complex characters. On television she appeared in such popular series as <span class="italic">Game On</span>, <span class="italic">Holding the Baby</span>, <span class="italic">Coupling</span>, <span class="italic">Casualty</span>, <span class="italic">The Vice</span>, and <span class="italic">EastEnders</span>. She was also a talented artist, and in 2004 held an exhibition of line drawings and watercolours at a gallery in West Hampstead. She was first diagnosed with cancer in 1999, and fought it with the same heroic and ferocious determination as her mother. Her last stage role was as Goneril in Steven Pimlott's version of <span class="italic">King Lear</span> at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester (2005), in which her sister played Cordelia; they had agreed to return to Chichester in part as a tribute to their mother, whose last stage performance had been there. Lou Gish died at St Mary's Hospital, Westminster, on 20 February 2006. She was survived by her partner of six years, the actor Nicholas James Sebastian (Nick) Rowe (<i>b</i>. 1966).<br>
