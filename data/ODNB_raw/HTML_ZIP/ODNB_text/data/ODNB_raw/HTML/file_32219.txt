<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  William Francis</span>  (1838&#150;1910), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, was born on 31 October 1838 at Ballyslateen, Suirville, co. Tipperary, the seventh child of Richard and Ellen Butler, who were Roman Catholics. Although descended from the earls of Ormond, the family were small landowners and suffered particularly through the famine of 1846&#150;7, which made a lasting impression on Butler himself. His childhood memories also included witnessing evictions and being hoisted onto the shoulders of Daniel O'Connell.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Butler's education began at a Jesuit school in Tullabeg, King's county, in 1847 but this was interrupted by his mother's death two years later, and it was some time before the family finances improved sufficiently to send him to Dr James Quinn's school in Dublin.<br>
<br>Watching the frequent departures of British regiments from Dublin during the Crimean War and later reading reports of the Indian mutiny appear to have fuelled Butler's desire for a military career, and he was directly commissioned as an ensign in the 69th foot without purchase on 17 September 1858 on the recommendation of a distant relative, Sir Richard Doherty. After two years in garrison depot at Fermoy, Butler joined the regiment in Burma and served with it there and at Madras. One leave took him to Vellore, where he was instrumental in erecting a monument to those of the 69th killed during the 1806 mutiny. Subsequently his interest in the regiment's past was to bear fruit in <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Historical Events Connected with the 69th Regiment</span>, published in 1870. A visit to St Helena on the voyage back to Britain in 1864 similarly stimulated an interest in Napoleon, and at his death Butler was to leave an unpublished manuscript on Napoleon's captivity.<br>
<br>Regimental service continued at Gosport and Aldershot, promotion to lieutenant having come on 17 November 1863. In 1866 the 69th went to Guernsey, enabling Butler to make the acquaintance of Victor Hugo. There followed a short period at the Curragh before the threat of Fenian raids from the United States saw the regiment embarked for Canada in August 1867. Inspired by the novels of Fenimore Cooper, Butler spent his first leave travelling the American frontier, and in the spring of 1868 replaced Lieutenant Redvers Buller as the inspecting officer of outposts on the Canadian frontier. Butler engaged in some frontier land speculation, as he was considering leaving the army rather than being purchased over in his regiment. He returned home on leave in September 1869 partly to raise the money required for the investment, and returned to Canada after his father's death in March 1870.<h2>
<a name="TheRedRivercampaign"></a>The Red River campaign</h2>There appeared little prospect of military advancement, but just before leaving Ireland, Butler had learned that Colonel Garnet Wolseley, whom he had briefly met in Montreal, was organizing an expedition to overthrow a provisional government established by <i>m&eacute;tis</i> on the Red River. Butler's celebrated telegram to Wolseley, &#145;Remember Butler, 69th Regiment&#146;, resulted in his being charged with an extended reconnaissance mission to the Red River settlements by way of the United States, involving a descent of the river to Lake Winnipeg. At some personal risk, Butler met the <i>m&eacute;tis</i> leader, Louis Riel, at Fort Garry in July, and then traversed some 400 miles of wilderness in twelve days to meet Wolseley. Riel had fled when Butler and the expedition returned to Fort Garry, but Butler remained there after the troops withdrew and undertook a new mission in October to assess the situation in Saskatchewan. Returning to Fort Garry in February 1871, he had accomplished a winter journey of over 2700 miles. His report to the lieutenant-governor of Manitoba recommended the establishment of a special force to keep law and order in the Northwest Territories, the North-West Mounted Police emerging two years later. Butler returned to England and, after visiting France in the latter stages of the Franco-Prussian War, eventually secured a captaincy in an unattached (half-pay) company on 13 April 1872. Butler's earlier land speculation had become fortuitously profitable with the discovery of oil, and he returned to the Canadian north-west, this time navigating the Athabasca, Peace, and Fraser rivers. Tall, strong, energetic, and resourceful, Butler was ideally equipped for exploration, and his literary talents also found full scope in describing his exploits&#151;<span class="italic">The Great Lone Land</span> (1872) and its sequel, <span class="italic">The Wild North Land</span> (1873), becoming classic travel narratives.<h2>
<a name="Asante"></a>Asante</h2>Returning to Ottawa from the north-west in August 1873, Butler discovered that Wolseley was now to lead an expedition to the Asante kingdom. Another telegram was dispatched and, on reaching England, Butler found orders to follow Wolseley to Asante. Wolseley not only had the gift of recognizing ability but also of fitting individuals into roles within the emerging <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69913/', "Wolseley ring")</script> appropriate to that ability. Again, Butler acted on his own initiative by going from Accra to the kingdom of Akim, and leading its fighting men on a parallel course to that of Wolseley from Cape Coast Castle towards the Asante capital at Kumasi. Arriving at Accra in October 1873, Butler had persuaded the Akim chieftains to advance within 20 miles of Kumasi, but his force deserted near to the Asante army Butler hoped to intercept. Wracked with near-fatal fever, Butler was invalided home and spent two months recovering at Netley Hospital. For his services he was promoted major on 1 April 1874 and received the CB. His account of the campaign, <span class="italic">Akim-foo: the Story of a Failure</span>, was published in 1875.<h2>
<a name="Africaandmarriage"></a>Africa and marriage</h2>Continuing his convalescence in Ireland, Butler was summoned in February 1875 to join Wolseley, who was going to Natal as governor and high commissioner to work towards South African confederation. Butler became protector of (Indian) immigrants and a member of the legislative council, and undertook missions to Bloemfontein, Kimberley, and Basutoland. On returning to England in October 1875 he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general at the War Office, where he remained until February 1879, when he was sent back to South Africa as assistant adjutant-general on lines of communication at Durban during the Anglo-Zulu War.<br>
<br>Butler married on 11 June 1877 a fellow Roman Catholic, Elizabeth Southerden Thompson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32209/', "Butler, Elizabeth Southerden, Lady Butler")</script>], the military painter. They had three sons and three daughters, one of whom died in infancy. Elizabeth's choice of subject, often reflecting her husband's views in depicting less celebratory imperial incidents and controversial Irish scenes such as that in <span class="italic">Evicted</span>, contributed to a decrease in her popularity. Butler was a more authoritarian husband and father than his radical sympathies for the underdog might suggest.<br>
<br>Butler received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 21 April 1880 for his South African services and he was considered as a possible private secretary to the new viceroy, Lord Ripon, but Gladstone apparently considered that a Roman Catholic viceroy was &#145;sufficiently experimental&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 215). Butler instead became assistant adjutant-general in the western district at Devonport. He held the post from 1 July 1880 until August 1884, with the exception of three months from August to October 1882 when he joined Wolseley's staff in Egypt as assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general, being present at Tell al-Kebir. Butler did not believe the campaign to be justified, and he protested against the possible execution of the Egyptian nationalist leader, Arabi Pasha. This did not damage his career, and he was made aide-de-camp to the queen with the rank of colonel on 18 November 1882. He published anonymously in 1882 <span class="italic">The Invasion of England</span>, in the popular genre of purposive future-war fiction pioneered by G. T. Chesney's <span class="italic">Battle of Dorking</span>.<br>
<br>Two years later Butler was again summoned by Wolseley for the expedition to relieve Gordon at Khartoum. Butler had met Gordon briefly in 1876 and greatly admired him. Consulted by Wolseley on the possibility of ascending the Nile in boats in the manner of the Red River campaign, Butler was charged in August 1884 with the provision of 400 boats, to be manned in Egypt by Canadian voyageurs. Butler and the boats&#151;later increased to 800&#151;arrived in September, and for the next three months he toiled to get boats, men, and supplies up the cataracts. It was an arduous task and the relationship between Wolseley and Butler deteriorated. It became more difficult with each campaign for Wolseley to find an adequate role for each of his ring as their individual seniority and reputation advanced. Butler had always worked best alone, and not only resented Herbert Stewart's preferment in a field command but also felt himself excluded by Buller, acting as Wolseley's chief of staff. Wolseley professed to find Butler's faults &#145;more amusing &amp; less objectionable than the virtues of other men&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WO 147/8), but he was irritated by Butler's habit of predicting events only in hindsight and resolved not to re-employ one who &#145;does not pull well in a team&#146;  (Wolseley to his wife, 22 Oct 1884; Hove Central Library, Wolseley Collections, W/P 13/27). Having accomplished the task of passing his boats upriver, Butler joined Wolseley at Korti and was attached to William Earle's river column in December 1884. He persuaded Earle to turn a Mahdist position at Kirbekan on 10 February 1885 rather than attacking it frontally, and when the expedition returned down the Nile he commanded rearguards at Meroe and Dongola.<br>
<br>Butler was given the local rank of brigadier-general on 1 July 1885 and by September, having been mentioned in dispatches, he was back at Wadi Halfa to command the force holding the Egyptian frontier. He repulsed a Mahdist attack at Koshe in December 1885 and that same month also commanded a brigade at Giniss, the last battle in which the British army fought in red coats. He continued to hold the frontier until his troops were replaced by Egyptians in May 1886 and he himself was invalided home in June. With no prospect of immediate re-employment, he spent the next two years in Brittany and Ireland. He was created KCB on 25 November 1886, but this was somewhat overshadowed by his being cited as a co-respondent of Lady Colin Campbell, a friend of his wife, in the sensational 1886 divorce action brought by her husband. There was little evidence that Butler was guilty of impropriety, but he appeared so from his refusal to take the witness stand during the hearings in November and December, for which he was criticized by the jury and the press.<br>
<br>While unemployed Butler completed his account of the Gordon expedition, <span class="italic">The Campaign of the Cataracts</span> and <span class="italic">Charles George Gordon</span>, both published in 1887. He was recalled to work on an inquiry into the army ordnance department, but the report he drafted was judged so offensive to the War Office civil authorities that it was suppressed, and his only employment in 1889 was to negotiate the purchase of sites for the new defences of London. However, in February 1890 he was given the Alexandria command, being promoted major-general on 7 December 1892 and moved to command a brigade at Aldershot on 11 November 1893. Transfer to south-east district at Dover followed on 24 February 1896.<br>
<br>To reach high military rank as an Irish Catholic nationalist was unusual, but it was the more so given the sympathy Butler showed for the crown's opponents in many of his campaigns: he later wrote of his regret that &#145;the majority of our recent wars should have had their origins in purely financial interests or sordid Stock Exchange ambitions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 349). Especially critical of the Egyptian expedition in 1882, he once declared the Gordon relief expedition the only justifiable campaign in which he had participated.<h2>
<a name="CommanderinSouthAfrica"></a>Commander in South Africa</h2>In October 1898 Butler was offered command of the troops in South Africa, and this proved the most controversial episode of his career. He was hostile to the tough, assertive policy of the high commissioner towards the Transvaal republic. In Alfred Milner's absence on leave, and without any guiding instructions, Butler temporarily assumed the appointment of high commissioner in November 1898, when Uitlander agitation was increased by the shooting of an Uitlander, Tom Edgar, by a Boer policeman. Sensing &#145;a colossal syndicate for the spread of systematic misrepresentation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 400), Butler refused to forward the Uitlander petition demanding British intervention. After Milner's return in February 1899 Butler prepared a scheme of defence for the Cape and Natal; later he was accused of negligence in not forwarding it to the War Office until June. Butler's relationship with Milner deteriorated further when Butler made it clear that he would regard any war as a calamity, and Milner insisted the cabinet replace either Butler or himself. Aware of the feeling against him, Butler tendered his resignation on 4 July 1899. It was accepted on 9 August and Butler left South Africa on 23 August, switching commands with Frederick Forestier-Walker at western district.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>Butler remained at western district for six years, with the exception of four months at Aldershot in late 1900, being promoted lieutenant-general on 9 October 1900. His perceived sympathies for the Boers, however, resulted in his being forbidden to attend the queen on her visit to Bristol in December 1899, and in continuing press hostility. It was not until 1903 that the royal commission on the war in South Africa largely vindicated his pre-war warnings and his defensive preparations. Indeed, Lord Esher concluded that Butler would be an ideal quartermaster-general in a reformed War Office structure. Butler's radicalism precluded any such appointment, although he did preside over a committee on the disposal of war stores in South Africa in 1905. After retiring on 31 October 1905, Butler received the GCB in June 1906 and was called to the Irish privy council in 1909. Made a governor of the Royal Hibernian Military School, Butler was also a member of the senate of the National University of Ireland and a commissioner of the board of national education in Ireland.<br>
<br>In retirement Butler devoted himself to writing, and his works included <span class="italic">The Light of the West with some Wayside Thoughts</span> (1909) and his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, begun in 1909 but finally edited and published by his daughter in 1911. He was also keenly interested in the Gaelic League. He died of a heart condition on 7 June 1910 at Bansha Castle, co. Tipperary, where he had lived since retirement, and was buried at Killardrigh.<br>
