<span class="headword">Thomas,  John Evan</span>  (1810&#150;1873), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Brecon, Brecknockshire, on 15 January 1810, the eldest son of John Thomas of Castle Street, Brecon, and his wife, Jane Evans of Aberedw, Radnorshire. His father encouraged his talent in carving and sent him to London to study under Francis Chantrey, and on the continent. Thomas produced the first of numerous church monuments in 1831, and began to practise as a portrait sculptor in London in 1834. He established a studio at 7 Lower Belgrave Place, from which he frequently exhibited marble portrait busts at the Royal Academy until 1862. His brother William Meredyth Thomas (1819&#150;1877), also a student of Chantrey, was his assistant for thirty years. In 1840 Thomas married Mary, daughter of William Gunter.<br>
<br>Despite his move to London, Thomas retained close links with the gentry of his home town, and the principal Welsh landed families. These sitters and patrons included the marquess of Camden (1840), Sir Watkin Williams Bailey Wynn (1840), Sir Charles Morgan (1841), Sir Joseph Bailey (1841, 1853) and Joseph Bailey jun. (1851, 1870), the marquess and marchioness of Bute (1842, 1844, 1848), Walter de Winton (1843) and John Parry de Winton (1850, 1870), vice-chancellor Sir James Lewis Knight-Bruce (1844, 1849), the first Lord Clive (1845, 1857), M. Williams, canon of St David's (1845), Sir William Nott (1848), Colonel Gwynne (1848), Viscount Hereford (1848), Sir Benjamin Hall (1852), William Daniel Conybeare, dean of Llandaff (1853), Alfred Ollivant, bishop of Llandaff (1853), and Rear-Admiral David Price (1855).<br>
<br>In 1834 Thomas received a commission from Queen Victoria to produce a tablet in memory of Madame Louis. In 1844 he exhibited at Westminster Hall his model for the statue of the second marquess of Londonderry, which was executed in marble and erected in Westminster Abbey in 1850. It received a mixed response, being described by the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> as &#145;without dignity in the head and without dignity in the attitude&#146;, while the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> considered that it had &#145;very considerable merit&#146; (both cited in Gunnis, 390). Thomas contributed statues of Henri de Londres, archbishop of Dublin, and William, earl of Pembroke, to Augustus Welby Pugin's rebuilding of the House of Lords in 1848. In the same year, his monumental seated bronze statue of Sir Charles Morgan was &#145;rapidly progressing&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 3 June 1848, 363); it was erected at Newport in 1851.<br>
<br>Thomas won the prize of 70 guineas at an eisteddfod in Abergavenny in 1848 for <span class="italic">The Death of Tewdrig, King of Gwent and Morganwg</span>, &#145;the best model in plaster illustrative of Cambro-British history&#146;, designed with the aid of suggestions by Lady Llanover, and modelled by his brother William  (Poole, 121). At the Royal Academy in 1849, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> found it &#145;a composition of high merit&#146;, &#145;and we hope to hear of its being executed in marble&#146;  (11 Aug 1849). It was cast as an electrotype by Elkington, Mason &amp; Co. and was included in their display at the Great Exhibition of 1851. A cast was presented in 1876 to the antiquary Morris Charles Jones, who gave it to the Powisland Museum in Welshpool. Another, bequeathed to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 1889, was later transferred to the Brecknock County Museum.<br>
<br>In 1849 Thomas was commissioned to execute a statue of the second marquess of Bute, for a fee of &pound;1900. It was exhibited with its model at the Great Exhibition, in addition to a plaster relief, <span class="italic">Science Unveiling Ignorance</span>, now at Cardiff city hall. The Bute statue was cast in bronze, and erected by public subscription in Cardiff in 1853. The <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> described the figure as &#145;standing in a dignified and unaffected attitude, as if addressing a public assembly. The effect is highly agreeable; and the likeness we believe to be undisputable&#146;  (19 March 1853). In 1852 Thomas was commissioned by the corporation of Brecon to design a statue in memory of the duke of Wellington, incorporating a relief of the death of General Thomas Picton. The sculptor himself contributed &pound;700 towards the memorial's cost of &pound;1200, and it was set up in 1854. That year he also submitted proposals for the Wellington memorial in the London Guildhall. In 1857 Thomas's bronze statue of John Henry Vivian was erected in the courtyard of the old guildhall in Swansea. According to the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, &#145;The individuality of the original is well and gracefully preserved &hellip; the position is easy and dignified, and the relative proportions of the statue and the pedestal are excellent&#146;  (20 June 1857). In the same year, the prince of Wales sat to Thomas for the full-length marble statue which the sculptor presented to the Welsh School in Ashford, Middlesex. In 1857&#150;8, following the death of Victoire, duchesse de Nemours, Thomas was commissioned by the duc de Nemours to produce a posthumous bust of his late wife and a portrait of her infant daughter Blanche. In 1865 his marble statue of the prince consort was erected on Castle Heights at Tenby, Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1842, Thomas was one of the original sponsors of the Great Exhibition of 1851. He retired to Penisha'r-Pentre, a mansion at Llansbyddyd, Brecknockshire, in 1857 and served as a JP, deputy lieutenant of Brecknockshire in 1862, and high sheriff in 1868. His nephew recalled that:<blockquote>Mr Evan Thomas' social qualities endeared him to a large circle of friends, and his conversational powers and fund of anecdote, as well as his mature judgement of all matters concerning art, made him an honoured guest in all the houses of the great in rank, literature and opulence. (Thomas)</blockquote>His early style was based upon the classicism of his master, Francis Chantrey, and subsequently loosened into a more diverse Victorian manner. He ran a prolific and successful studio and was the first Welsh sculptor to establish a significant career and reputation largely through Welsh patronage. John Evan Thomas died at his London address, 58 Buckingham Palace Road, on 9 October 1873, his wife having predeceased him; he was buried on 14 October in Brompton cemetery, London.<br>
