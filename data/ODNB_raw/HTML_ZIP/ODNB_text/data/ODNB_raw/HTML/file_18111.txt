</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsh,  Herbert</span>  (1757&#150;1839), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough and biblical critic</span>, was born at Faversham, Kent, on 10 December 1757 and baptized there on 3 January 1758, the eldest son of Richard Marsh (1727&#150;1778), vicar of Faversham and a minor canon of Canterbury, and his wife, Elizabeth Frend, the daughter of a stonemason. There followed another son, Richard, who became a Fleet Street printer, and a daughter, who married a lawyer. <h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>Marsh's paternal grandfather, Richard Marsh (1670/71&#150;1732), initiated a clerical family tradition: having been admitted a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1688, he obtained a fellowship in 1696 and became vicar at St Margaret Atcliffe, Kent, in 1700. As chaplain to Edward Villiers, first earl of Jersey, Richard Marsh was committed to the revolutionary settlement of 1689. Opposed to Newtonian physics, which he regarded as a hubristic alternative to Mosaic cosmology, he advocated that reason and learning should be subordinate to revelation. He believed that only a learned clergy of the established church could maintain the mystery of religion and uphold the need for good works inspired by grace, against the threats posed by religious enthusiasm, deism and Socinianism. Apart from his anti-Newtonianism, Richard Marsh's ideas re-emerged in the mature thought of his grandson. <br>
<br>Herbert Marsh was educated at Faversham grammar school and then, from 1770, at the King's School, Canterbury, in company with his cousin William Frend, whose later unitarian and republican views were at odds with Marsh's own. He was admitted a king's scholar on 4 March 1771. His headmaster, Osmund Beauvoir, was an accomplished modern linguist who had assisted Archbishop William Wake in his negotiations at the Sorbonne over a possible union between the Gallican church and the Church of England. Marsh went up to St John's College, Cambridge, on 19 October 1775 and was admitted a foundress scholar on 7 November. He chose as his tutor a fellow undergraduate, Thomas Jones (1756&#150;1807), of Trinity College. Marsh did not share his tutor's unitarian leanings yet defended freedom of thought. He greatly admired Jones's interest in natural theology, although he later subordinated it to biblical revelation. Besides, Marsh's current interests were mathematics and physics; his theological interests developed later (from 1790). In 1779 he graduated BA as second wrangler and second Smith's prizeman; he proceeded MA in 1782 and BD in July 1792. He was admitted foundress fellow of his college on 23 March 1779 and was ordained deacon by the bishop of Ely on 16 May 1780. For the next five years he fulfilled his college teaching obligations. At the general election in 1784 he canvassed for the new prime minister, William Pitt the younger, for one of the Cambridge University seats; he was an admirer of Pitt throughout his life. <h2>
<a name="Travelandintellectualdevelopment"></a>Travel and intellectual development</h2>In 1785 Marsh received permission to travel to Egypt and Arabia. After passing through Belgium and the Netherlands, in 1786 he consulted the eminent biblical scholar Johann David Michaelis in G&ouml;ttingen about learning Arabic. While wintering in Leipzig, where he lodged in the Burgstrasse and read the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, his lifelong asthmatic condition worsened. He was confined to bed for the best part of the next three years, but was able to visit Christoph Martin Wieland in Weimar, a writer whom he held in awe. During his illness he became fascinated with Enlightenment authors, although his reading of Hermann Samuel Reimarus's writings shook his faith in biblical inspiration. As a partial antidote Marsh began translating Johann Gottfried Eichhorn's <span class="italic">Einleitung in das alte Testaments</span>, but his hopes for publication were crushed by Dr Thomas Kipling's advice that Cambridge University Press would not sanction the work. Kipling regarded Eichhorn's comparative criticism of biblical books with other Semitic texts as too controversial. Instead Marsh was commissioned to translate the fourth edition of Michaelis's <span class="italic">Einleitung in die g&ouml;ttlichen Schriften des neuen Bundes</span>, his introduction to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Sensing a change in the intellectual climate in England, he feared the odium of heresy even for translating the less controversial work. He added extensive notes to Michaelis's text that primed his readers in continental biblical criticism. <br>
<br>With improving health, Marsh returned to England in 1793 to take his delayed BD examination. His two qualifying sermons registered a reconstructed orthodoxy: one defended Mosaic authorship of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and the other urged rigorous theological education for ordinands in the Church of England. However, during William Frend's university trial in May 1794 for sedition, Marsh was politically compromised for helping his cousin by refusing to give evidence against him in court. He returned to Leipzig under a cloud. Stung by the criticism, he published a thorough refutation of George Travis's defence against Edward Gibbon of the authenticity of <span class="roman">1 John</span> 5: 7, entitled <span class="italic">Letters to Archdeacon Travis, in Vindication of one of the Translators' Notes to Michaelis's Introduction</span> (1795). Marsh was not defending the unitarian interpretation of the text suggested by Gibbon but was attacking the slipshod theology current in England and evident in Travis's <span class="italic">Letters to Edward Gibbon</span>. <br>
<br>Marsh's greatest work, however, arose from his notes on Michaelis. In 1795, dissatisfied with Michaelis's account, he began investigating the sources of the synoptic gospels, publishing in 1801 a sophisticated hypothesis that argued for their historical reliability. His <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Origin and Composition of the Three First Canonical Gospels</span> rigorously developed Eichhorn's theory that the first three gospels shared a common source (now lost) and was taken up by both Eichhorn and Paulus. In conservative wartime Britain, however, Marsh's hypothesis aroused fear and engendered a counter-hypothesis of &#145;detached narratives&#146; that maintained the integrity of authorship of each gospel, which was successively developed by John Randolph, George Gleig, Daniel Veysie, and Connop Thirlwall. Although Marsh rejected the argument that <span class="roman">Mark</span> was the first of the three gospels to have been written, he anticipated the &#145;two-document&#146; hypothesis, whereby <span class="roman">Mark</span> and the lost document were the sources for <span class="roman">Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">Luke</span>. <h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>In 1797 changing events shifted Marsh's interests to politics. German Anglophilia was replaced by hostility on account of Pitt's maritime blockade of continental Europe. Together with his expatriate democrat friend James Macdonald, Marsh lamented the new German mood. When in 1797&#150;8 the <span class="italic">Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</span> printed essays attacking British politics and culture, Marsh was anxious to reply. In March 1798 he published anonymously articles in the <span class="italic">Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</span> and the <span class="italic">Neue Teutsche Merkur</span>. The disillusioned Anglophile Johann Wilhelm von Archenholtz responded with invective in his journal <span class="italic">Minerva</span>, arousing Marsh to write openly in the July edition of the <span class="italic">Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</span>. He had by now lost interest in theology and entered the lists as a political-historical writer. The result was his <span class="italic">Historische Uebersicht der Politik England und Frankreichs</span> (1799), in which he argued that France not Britain was the aggressor in the current war. The <span class="italic">Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</span> in 1799 reported that Marsh had proved his case, and Friedrich von Gentz's influential <span class="italic">Historische Journal</span> followed suit. Flushed with success, Marsh translated the <span class="italic">Historische Uebersicht</span> into French and English. In Britain only the Foxite whig William Belsham wrote a rebuff, to which Marsh replied with conclusive satisfaction. <br>
<br>By May 1799 Marsh was engaged to marry Marianne Emilie Charlotte (1774&#150;1844), the daughter of a Leipzig merchant, John Lecarriere. Soon afterwards he rented rooms near the Neumarkt, Leipzig, in preparation for his bride. Seeking financial independence to free him from his college fellowship so that he could marry, he attempted to enter commerce. He proposed a smoked herring industry based in Stornoway, on the Hebridean Isle of Lewis, and manned by Dutch prisoners of war, which would supply the German market hit by Pitt's maritime blockade. He subsequently offered his services to the board of agriculture as an overseas adviser. But, unable to leave Marianne, he refused both a place on Lord Elgin's expedition to Istanbul and the reportedly strenuous post of director of the Weimar Belvedere Academy. Instead in 1802 he pressed in turn to deputize for the aged regius professor of history at Cambridge, to become royal historiographer for England (though based in Leipzig), and for a consulship at Leipzig. While awaiting news from London, Marsh was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 8 January 1801 and held office as junior bursar of St John's from 21 March 1801 to 20 March 1802. <br>
<br>In 1800, through the influence of Pitt's adviser George Tomline, Marsh had been interviewed by Pitt and offered a &pound;500 pension from the secret-service fund. Hoping for more substantial preferment or a title that might carry weight in the German principalities, Marsh delayed, then accepted. The pension was established under Henry Addington only in 1803 and withdrawn by Lord Liverpool on the accession of George IV in 1820, in view of Marsh's then substantially larger income. In 1806 he began canvassing covertly for election to the Lady Margaret professorship of divinity at Cambridge. In the event he was elected without opposition in 1807 and was awarded a DD by mandate the following year. Finally released from his college fellowship, he married Marianne by special licence at Harwich on 1 July 1807. <h2>
<a name="Doctrinaldisputes"></a>Doctrinal disputes</h2>Until returning to Britain in 1800 Marsh, despite his trinitarian allegiance, had been unconcerned about matters of Christian doctrine. Furthermore in 1798 he thought that political views alone divided Anglican churchmen from dissenters. Between 1800 and 1805 his alarm at the fragile balance of church and state increasingly focused on the supposedly doubtful loyalty of the evangelicals in the Church of England and their non-denominational co-operation with dissent. In accord with family tradition and a growing high-church mood, Marsh responded to recent evangelical challenges by preaching in 1805 four &#145;strongly anti-Calvinist&#146; sermons which attacked the doctrine of double predestination, which he believed was conducive to antinomianism. In expounding the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, he appealed to the authority of &#145;the <span class="roman">Bible</span> alone&#146;, not to tradition or to the church fathers. He astutely cultivated politically sympathetic patrons, principally the Hardwicke family in Cambridgeshire, for which his Bene't Street house in Cambridge was targeted by an angry mob in March 1810. <br>
<br>Marsh's attempts to build a political base were eclipsed by the Bible Society controversy that broke out in Cambridge in 1811. His public opposition to the society&#151;an interdenominational and evangelically led society that distributed bibles at home and abroad&#151;had been preceded by a successful campaign to promote Church of England educational provision for the poor. This came in response to the opening by Joseph Lancaster of a non-denominational school in Cambridge in 1808 and the gathering momentum of the Royal Lancastrian Society. Alarmed, Marsh used a charity schools sermon at St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 13 June 1811 to appeal for a parallel society to be founded that would be guided by the principles of the established church. In October he met with the Hackney phalanx to plan the scheme. Marsh's sermon proved the catalyst for the formation that year of the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. The society mushroomed with support from Anglican churchmen of all persuasions, and Marsh was delighted at the way in which it united the church. But he misinterpreted this support as opposition to non-denominational enterprises. Thus, when undergraduates proposed forming a Bible Society auxiliary in Cambridge, Marsh industriously opposed them with a personally distributed <span class="italic">Address to the Members of the Senate of the University of Cambridge</span> (1811). But his strategy was defeated when the Bible Society group won the support of the evangelical William Farish, professor of chemistry, Lord Hardwicke, who agreed to chair the meeting, and the university chancellor, the duke of Gloucester, who agreed to preside over the society. The Bible Society meeting, swept by a prevailing apocalyptic mood, was a massive success, and Marsh conceded defeat. <br>
<br>Marsh's principal objection to the Bible Society lay in his insistence that the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> should be distributed together with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In his subsequent <span class="italic">Inquiry into the consequences of neglecting to give the Prayer Book with the Bible &hellip; with &hellip; other important matter relative to the British and Foreign Bible Society</span> (1812), he depicted the consequences of such neglect as a possible repetition of the civil war, in which the evangelicals and dissenters were presented as new puritans who fostered undisciplined interpretation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He warned that disestablishment and perpetual conflict between warring sects could follow. He still sought to win back the evangelicals in the church, but was not mollified when William Wilberforce instituted an evangelical Prayer Book and Homily Society. He wanted evangelicals to forsake the Bible Society for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK). <br>
<br>Marsh regarded the overseas distribution of bibles in a different light, however. In countries where there was no established church he supported <span class="roman">Bible</span> distribution by Roman Catholics or evangelicals, and he personally subscribed to the work of the Baptist Society in India and the London Missionary Society in Africa. But in his <span class="italic">History of the Translations which have been made of the Scriptures</span> (1812) he successfully challenged the Bible Society's inflated claims about the extent of its work abroad. Although he failed to win back leading evangelicals such as Isaac Milner, there were positive achievements. He had pressurized many evangelicals into protesting their loyalty to the establishment, helped galvanize the SPCK, and inspired a movement for Anglican education of the poor. He also rebuffed the Roman Catholic congratulations offered by Father Peter Gandolphy in his <span class="italic">Comparative View of the Churches of England and Rome</span> (1814), which became a standard work of anti-Catholic apologetics. Reprinted in 1816, 1841, and 1852, the book delivered him from any suspicion of popery. <h2>
<a name="LadyMargaretprofessorofdivinity"></a>Lady Margaret professor of divinity</h2>Marsh began his first series of professorial lectures in 1809 and, hoping to reach a wider audience, he broke with tradition by writing the lectures in English rather than Latin and by lecturing in the church of Great St Mary rather than the divinity schools. He intended to lecture in three-year cycles but, because of the Bible Society dispute, the need to pursue his own research, and episcopal duties from 1816 onwards, he lectured only in 1809&#150;10, 1813, 1816, 1822, and 1823. While he published thirty-six lectures, he delivered lectures on only three of the seven branches of divinity he planned to cover. He privately printed an abstract of the fourth branch for his Peterborough clergy in 1820 and a 46-page &#145;History of interpretation&#146; in 1828. Thereafter his interest waned, due to his ill health and episcopal duties. Besides, he felt a new sense of beleaguerment by the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in 1828 and the achievement of Catholic emancipation in 1829, which was reflected in his <span class="italic">Charge to his Clergy</span> of 1831. <br>
<br>The lectures as published covered the topics of biblical criticism, interpretation, authenticity, and credibility, and the evidences of Christianity. The content was bibliocentric and expressed characteristic themes from the latitudinarian tradition of the eighteenth century. Marsh was keen to echo the protestant reformers' abandonment of church tradition in favour of reason and learning instructed by scripture. This meant a rigorously grammatical interpretation which, he argued, only the learned clergy of an established church could provide. Public response to his lectures was generally favourable. Some Unitarians were disappointed, as they had hoped that Marsh's earlier refutation of Travis had indicated his rejection of trinitarian dogma. Evangelicals rejoiced that Marsh had abandoned the uncommitted divinity of his Michaelis notes for a clearly apologetic purpose, even if they regretted his intellectualist emphasis. From America, the New England biblical critic John Stevens Buckminster sent students to Marsh on the strength of reading his lectures. In contrast, Bishop John Hobart of New York felt that a few lectures were no substitute for the comprehensive training that could be provided by dedicated theological colleges. Marsh did not seek to restructure the training of ordinands in Cambridge, although he considerably raised current learning standards. He certainly stirred controversy by calling for a revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. But on the whole, while in his lectures he introduced his audiences to new critical methods, he deliberately shielded them from knowledge of more radical higher criticism, such as that of Eichhorn or Paulus. In opting for a safe and gentle introduction to his subject, he little prepared his audience for the coming onslaughts of higher criticism. Instead he cautiously married a digest of biblical criticism to the &#145;evidence-writing&#146; of Hanoverian theology. His Michaelis notes in this respect were ahead of his <span class="italic">Lectures</span> both in discussing new critical methods and in facing awkward challenges. <h2>
<a name="LlandaffandPeterborough"></a>Llandaff and Peterborough</h2>Marsh's learning and his loyalty to the religious and political establishment were rewarded with preferment. On 13 July 1816 he was nominated bishop of Llandaff and on 25 August was consecrated in Lambeth Palace chapel by Archbishop William Howley. As the junior bishop, Marsh was chaplain to the House of Lords and so resided in Delahaye Street, London, until 1819, during which time he incurred debts of &pound;4000. Despite the inadequate stipend that accompanied his appointment, he attended to his diocese with vigour. To expedite improvements in building stock and church fabric, he revived the office of rural dean. Seeking an effective clergy, he made facility in the Welsh language a condition for institution, and formulated eighty-seven doctrinal questions for prospective candidates in his diocese. In February 1817 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. <br>
<br>On 8 April 1819 Marsh was elected bishop of Peterborough. Aware of a phalanx of evangelical clergy in his bishopric, he made clear that he would brook no irregularities, such as hymn singing. Nor would he sanction unnecessary non-residence or neglected glebe houses. He also promoted double rather than single services and revived the office of rural dean in his new diocese, subdividing existing deaneries for greater efficiency. A significant if modest amount of repair work was completed by 1823 and double services increased over the following decade. Setting an example of dedication, Marsh frequently preached charity sermons and conducted confirmations between triennial visitations. He regarded his examination for curates as a legitimate exercise of episcopal power, a view recently reinforced by the 1817 <span class="roman">Consolidation Act</span>. His eighty-seven questions, nicknamed &#145;Cobwebs to catch Calvinists&#146;, were designed to &#145;exhibit a connected View of God's dealings with Man under the New Covenant&#146; and excluded Calvinist doctrines of election and eternal security. Instead they emphasized baptismal regeneration, a synergistic doctrine of grace, the need for good works following justification, and the error of unitarianism. In 1821 and 1822 frustrated evangelical incumbents, whose curate appointees had been excluded by Marsh's examination, unsuccessfully petitioned the House of Lords in protest. Their petitions did, however, arouse misgivings in the upper house about Marsh's methods. Both he and his opponents went to print. Sydney Smith's satirical attack on &#145;Persecuting bishops&#146; in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> damaged Marsh's reputation, even though conservative journals defended him. Marsh made some concessions by reducing the number of questions from eighty-seven to thirty-six, by licensing at least five evangelical curates in Peterborough in the early 1820s, and by nurturing others. His intervention on behalf of one evangelical curate, Samuel Paris, however, was defeated in the court of arches and at the king's bench in 1824. Such failures underlined the limits of episcopal power, though Marsh's examination was itself legal. Indeed, some bishops, such as William Magee of Dublin in 1822 and Henry Philpotts in 1841, instituted rigorous examinations despite the odium Marsh suffered. <h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Marsh's relations with the county were as mixed as those with the diocese, for political interests often shaped relationships. He was a focus for tory loyalty in Northamptonshire, while Lord Fitzwilliam led the whig interest. The relationship between the two men varied from businesslike politeness to outright hostility, with clashes over the leasing of episcopal land, the rights of which Marsh tenaciously defended. Even a joint project to build a national school in Peterborough in 1823 nearly foundered on Fitzwilliam's suspicion. But Marsh learned tact. In a conflict about a Catholic claims petition in 1825, he carefully explained his position. In 1832, when Fitzwilliam tried to engineer the purchase of a glebe farm, Marsh negotiated firmly but with legal correctness. He had learned his lesson. Though his many commitments continually encroached on his private life, he and his wife maintained a solicitous friendship with the poet John Clare from 1819 to 1835. <br>
<br>From 1835 Marsh was senile and bedridden. While he lay on his deathbed in 1839 the diocese was run by his wife, his elder son, and the diocesan registrar, John Gates. The trio clashed with the third Earl Fitzwilliam over property transfers and voting interests. Although Fitzwilliam was forced to apologize for insulting Marianne Marsh, it was an unfortunate end to Marsh's episcopate. <br>
<br>Marsh died on 1 May 1839 in Peterborough and was buried in the eastern chapel of his cathedral on the 8th. He had been patriotic, gregarious, and industrious. Although combative in public, he was uniformly gracious in private, even with opponents. If self-promoting, he was courageous and loyally devoted to the established church. He was survived by his widow, who died in Peterborough in 1844, and by his sons Herbert Charles Marsh (1808&#150;1851), whom he appointed vicar of Barnack in 1832 and who died insane, and George Henry Marsh (1814&#150;1896), who became vicar of Great Snoring.<br>
