<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson,  Thomas Perronet</span>  (1783&#150;1869), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 15 March 1783 at 17 Lowgate, Hull, eldest of the four children of Thomas Thompson (1754&#150;1828) and his wife, Philothea Perronet Thompson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Briggs (1753&#150;1823). His father was a banker and merchant, MP for Midhurst 1807&#150;18, and a prominent Wesleyan preacher and friend of William Wilberforce. His mother was the granddaughter of Vincent Perronet, vicar of Shoreham and associate of John Wesley. Thompson was educated at Hull grammar school, then under the headmastership of Joseph Milner, the church historian. In 1798 he went up to Queens' College, Cambridge, and began a long friendship with its president, Isaac Milner, brother of Joseph and later dean of Carlisle. Thompson gained the BA degree as seventh wrangler in 1802, and was elected to a fellowship of his college in 1804. In 1803 he joined the navy as midshipman on HMS <i>Isis</i>, flagship of Vice-Admiral (later Lord) Gambier, but transferred to the army three years later. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in 1806, lieutenant in 1808, captain in 1814, major in 1825, and lieutenant-colonel (unattached) in 1829, at which time he retired from military service. His subsequent promotions were made by brevet: to colonel (1846), major-general (1854), lieutenant-general (1860), and general (1868). Thompson was involved in several important battles. He was captured by the Spaniards after General John Whitelock's ill-fated expedition against Buenos Aires in July 1807. In 1813&#150;14 he saw action against the French at Nivelles, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and was later awarded the Peninsula medal with four clasps. By this time he was a husband and father. In 1811 he had married Anne Elizabeth Barker (1793&#150;1871) of York. They had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1808, after returning from captivity in South America, Thompson became the first crown-appointed governor of Sierra Leone. Wilberforce and the Saints had established the colony in 1787 as a place where free black people would cultivate the land, carry on profitable trade, and demonstrate to the world that they were not peculiarly suited to slavery, despite the claims of slave traders. But the Sierra Leone Company had never provided effective administration. There were civil disorders and food shortages, and relations with surrounding native peoples were far from cordial. Firmly opposed to slavery, and enjoying Wilberforce's patronage, Thompson was keenly interested in the fate of the colony and, when the Saints transferred Sierra Leone to the crown, the British government accepted their suggestion that he would be a suitable governor. When he discovered undisguised slavery in Sierra Leone, however, and realized that the Saints and the British government had been misled about the colony's social and economic conditions, Thompson introduced an extensive range of reforms and made serious allegations against the colony's former administrators. Embarrassed by his revelations, the Saints advised the government to recall him and he returned to Britain in 1810. Thompson was convinced that the Saints sacrificed him in order to save face. They feared that Thompson's claims about Sierra Leone would threaten their reputations and achievements, particularly the 1807 abolition act. Thompson was deprived of opportunities publicly to vindicate his policies in Africa, and deeply disappointed by removal from the governorship. He also blamed the British government for failing to respond to his call for an inquiry.<br>
<br>In 1815 Thompson went to Bombay as interpreter and political adviser attached to the 17th light dragoons. After several military engagements in India, where he served under Francis Rawdon Hastings and Sir John Malcolm, he inserted an anti-slave-trade clause in a treaty concluded between the British crown and peoples of the Persian Gulf. But this success was followed by a serious disappointment for Thompson. In November 1820 he led an ill-conceived expedition against Arab pirates, which led to a court martial. Though acquitted, he was also reprimanded for undertaking an important mission with inadequate forces. Thompson blamed his Sepoy troops for failing to stand and face an enemy charge. The Bombay authorities could not risk trouble with their Sepoys, however, and forced Thompson to take the blame. He often referred to this disappointment, and to the Sierra Leone controversy, in later years. These were significant opinion-shaping experiences.<br>
<br>Thompson engaged in political and literary activities after returning from the east in 1822. With much of Europe in turmoil, he joined London committees for the support of political refugees and interested himself in the cause of Greek and Spanish liberals. He became a close friend of John Bowring, who introduced Thompson to Jeremy Bentham and his circle of philosophical radicals. Thompson later accepted an invitation to translate part of Bentham's <span class="italic">Constitutional Code</span> into Arabic. Developing an ever keener interest in political economy, Thompson contributed an article &#145;On the instruments of exchange&#146; to the first issue of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> (January 1824). In 1826 he published his <span class="italic">True Theory of Rent</span>. This supported Adam Smith's idea that rent levels were determined by demand for agricultural products, and rejected the principle advanced by David Ricardo and James Mill that rent was dependent on production costs. Thompson's arguments were favourably received by Jean-Baptiste Say, and also influenced later commentators such as J. M. Keynes and J. A. Schumpeter. Thompson believed that the Ricardian idea of rent was a weak link in the case against the corn laws, and followed the <span class="italic">True Theory of Rent</span> with his most famous pamphlet, the <span class="italic">Catechism on the Corn Laws</span> (1827). This persuasive argument for repeal proved extremely influential, went into eighteen editions by 1834, and prompted Thompson's election as fellow of the Royal Society in 1828. As well as his political and economic writing in subsequent years, he published works on enharmonic principles, just intonation, geometry, and the theory of parallels. His enharmonic organ was displayed at the Great Exhibition in 1851, and one of his mathematical pamphlets was extremely popular in France after its translation by Professor M. van Tenac of the royal establishment at Rochefort. During the 1830s Thompson joined the Foreign Learned Society and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de la Statistique Universelle, and was a corresponding member of several other such bodies.<br>
<br>But it was mainly as a politician that Thompson now made his mark. The death of his father in 1828 brought him a modest fortune, and he began to devote himself to radical causes. The financial difficulties of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> prompted him to become its part owner and co-editor from 1829 until he sold up to Sir William Molesworth in 1836. He was a prolific contributor to the review, and his articles on parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, and free trade were particularly influential (40,000 copies of the piece on Catholic emancipation were issued as <span class="italic">The Catholic State Waggon</span> in 1829). He also wrote the articles of 1829&#150;30 which defended utilitarianism against the assault published by T. B. Macaulay in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. An unsuccessful parliamentary candidate at Preston in January 1835, Thompson narrowly won in Hull the following June, but the tories petitioned against his return. Though this petition was dismissed after an inquiry, Thompson lost &pound;4000 in costs, which he considered an outrage. He did not contest Hull at the 1837 general election, but stood instead at Maidstone, where he came bottom of the poll. He was then an unsuccessful candidate in Marylebone (1838), Manchester (1839), Hull, and Cheltenham (both 1841), and Sunderland (1845), before his victory in Bradford at the 1847 general election. He lost this seat in 1852, but served again as MP for Bradford from 1857 to 1859. In the Commons, Thompson was a consistent supporter of radical reform and free trade, but his political alliances could and did change because he placed principle above party. He was not reluctant to vote against usual allies when he thought they were in the wrong. One such occasion came in 1851, when Thompson supported the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span>. As an MP, he wrote reports about political affairs to his constituents, and these were regularly published in the Liberal press. He continued to send letters and articles to London and provincial newspapers throughout his career. Contributions on military affairs in the Crimea appeared in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1854. Much of his work was published in two collections, <span class="italic">Exercises, Political and Others</span> (6 vols., 1842) and <span class="italic">Audi alteram partem</span> (3 vols., 1858&#150;61). The latter collection included Thompson's criticism of the policies pursued in India at the time of the mutiny. He always retained his early fascination with the customs and religions of the east.<br>
<br>Thompson knew and co-operated to varying degrees with most of the leading radicals of his era. His most active period outside parliament came in the late 1830s and early 1840s, when he was a tireless spokesman and fund-raiser for the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> (which republished some of his writings), a promoter of &#145;sensible&#146; Chartism, and the advocate of broad liberal alliances in towns where co-operative effort drawing in whigs, moderate reformers, and radicals seemed to be most viable. Among his later writings were the <span class="italic">Catechism on the Currency</span> (1848), which stressed the advantages of a paper currency, unconvertible but limited, and an exposure of <span class="italic">Fallacies Against the Ballot</span> (1855), later reissued as <span class="italic">A Catechism</span> (1859). He also involved himself in the agitation of the National Parliamentary Reform Association (1848&#150;52).<br>
<br>Thompson was a short man, stout and physically strong, with a large nose and high forehead. His hair turned grey relatively early, and he lost teeth as a result of illness in Sierra Leone. Known for simple and abstemious habits, he never seemed concerned about physical comforts and preferred to devote money and attention to politics. For much of his adult life he was vegetarian and teetotal, which suited his austere disposition and, he believed, prolonged good health. Thompson spoke with a slight northern accent and habitual solecisms. He enjoyed relating stories for the amusement of himself and others, but was also prone to bouts of depression, particularly when disappointed in his public career. In particular, the delay in brevet promotions to which he was entitled was a source of much anguish in the 1840s and 1850s. He was slow to forgive a slight, and in his public activity proved not to be effective as part of a team. Headstrong and independent, he was sometimes too abrasive and blunt even for close associates. With advancing years he was dismissive of those he regarded as his juniors in terms of intellectual accomplishments and public service.<br>
<br>Though born in the Church of England and reared a Methodist, Thompson rejected the faith of his parents. He described himself as a Sabellian, though he later drifted back towards orthodoxy. He had no narrow denominational ties and remained firmly committed to religious toleration, but was staunchly protestant and in his final years expressed deep respect for the church, regarding it as an indispensable institution in spite of its shortcomings.<br>
<br>Thompson was never fond of Cottingham Castle, the country house to which the Thompsons moved from nearby Hull in 1797, and when his father died it was let to tenants. After retiring from the army in 1829 he settled with his own family in London. During the 1830s they resided at 13 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, and in 1841 moved to Eliot Vale, Blackheath. Thompson died there on 6 September 1869. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
