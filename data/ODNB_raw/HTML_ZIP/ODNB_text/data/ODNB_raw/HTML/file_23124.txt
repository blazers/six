<span class="headword">Randolph,  Thomas</span>  (1701&#150;1783), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 30 August 1701 in Canterbury, Kent, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Randolph (1657&#150;1726), recorder of Canterbury, and his wife, Grace (1674&#150;1750), daughter of John Blowe. He was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and elected to a Kent scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 19 November 1715; he graduated BA (1719), MA (1723), BD (1730), and DD (1735). On 22 August 1738 he married Thomasina (1706/7&#150;1783), daughter of William Honywood, of Cherdon, and Frances Raleigh, and sister of Sir John Honywood, third baronet. There were six children of the marriage, three sons and three daughters, of whom one daughter, Thomasina, and three sons, Thomas, Herbert, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23120/', "John Randolph")</script>, survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>The early years of Randolph's career in the Church of England followed a conventional path and, while still pursuing his studies and publishing, notably <span class="italic">The Christian's Faith a Rational Assent</span> (1744&#150;5), he attracted the attention of the bishop of Oxford and regius professor of divinity, John Potter, through whose influence he was made rector of Petham and Waltham in Kent. On 23 April 1748, however, he was elected to the presidency of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where his younger brother, Francis, was still a fellow. His working life in Oxford as president of a small college was enhanced by public office as vice-chancellor of the university from 1756 to 1759, archdeacon of Oxford from 1767, and Lady Margaret professor of divinity from 1768.<br>
<br>Assiduous and methodical in his work, Randolph's legacy to his college persists in numerous handwritten notebooks covering college business and the history and management of its estates. Letters from tenants are often endorsed with notes of his replies, and the large volume of estate material is digested into a compendious survey. Typical of his interest is the notebook on Mapledurwell estate, &#145;Notes on manorial customs, with notes on copyholds, rents, fines and tenants&#146;  (Corpus Christi College archives, Cb 9/1). Similarly, when the Cheltenham school needed investigation in 1761 the president made a pr&eacute;cis of the school statutes. Randolph's presidency also inaugurated regular dated notes of the decisions of the senior members; these minutes, or acts and proceedings, have proved a valuable source for historians of collegiate life in eighteenth-century Oxford. From the earliest months of his presidency the grant books are written up in Randolph's hand. The important collections of William Fulman and Lord Coleraine were bound, with their contents listed and foliated, by the president himself.<br>
<br>Orthodoxy and tradition governed Randolph's attitude to church and state. Apart from theological sermons preached and published in the middle years of his life he came to grips with public controversy in his publications over the question of subscription at matriculation to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. His two most trenchant pieces were <span class="italic">An answer to a pamphlet entitled Reflections on the impropriety and inexpediency of lay-subscription to the XXXIX articles in the University of Oxford</span> (1772) and <span class="italic">An answer to a pamphlet, entitled, Considerations on the propriety of requiring a subscription to articles of faith</span> (1774). However, having put up a stout defence of the soundness of the established position, he bowed to the majority, mindful perhaps of his own previous position when he had preached against party zeal in January 1752. Though his part in the expulsion of the sixteen Methodist dissenters from St Edmund Hall in 1768 had caused unpopularity he was not intolerant of dissent when practised within the framework of the law; his concern was to preserve the perceived orthodoxy of the university.<br>
<br>During his term as vice-chancellor Randolph faced up to two notable controversies: the reorganization of the delegacy of the university press in 1757&#150;8 and the skirmishes preceding the election of the new chancellor, Lord Westmorland, in 1759. These events have been well documented in print because they were closely connected to the career of the eminent lawyer William Blackstone. Blackstone's campaign for a radical overhaul of the management structure and business methods of the press was sharply focused on Randolph, who, as vice-chancellor, was chairman of the delegates.<br>
<br>Evidence of Randolph's benign and just leadership in his college is clear from the earliest days of his administration. The acts and proceedings reveal patient but firm dealings with the misdemeanours of junior (and sometimes senior) members; time is always offered to both parties to consider their position and to reconvene for further meetings, punishment is never summarily enforced, negotiation seems endlessly patient. Having come from a family with a strong affection for the college where he and his brothers had been educated and subsequent generations were to follow, and with his own wider contacts, Randolph raised the status of the college in academic terms through judicious selection; subsequently it became associated with good teaching and firm discipline. As one of the least well paid of Oxford heads of houses he was also a prudent manager of his money. His private accounts, which he kept with the same meticulous detail and care as the college records, give a privileged view of his domestic life. The records show a simple, well-ordered life; donations to charity feature frequently and provision for his family is consistently generous.<br>
<br>Randolph died at Corpus on 24 March 1783 and was buried there on 2 April, after a funeral oration in the chapel preached by John Buckland, fellow of the college. In his will it is his family, his servants, his circle of relatives, and the poor of the parishes of Petham and Waltham, Salwood and Hythe who benefit from the modest fruits of his orderly life. His widow died later in the same year, on 11 December aged seventy-six.<br>
