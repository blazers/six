<span class="headword">Bell,  Horace</span>  (1839&#150;1903), <span class="occ">civil engineer and author</span>, was born at 81 Guilford Street, London, on 17 June 1839, the son of George Bell, a London merchant, and his wife, Frances Dude, of Norfolk. Bell received his early education in France and at Louth, Lincolnshire. He began engineering at fifteen under John Wilson in London but soon sought broader based training as an apprentice to D. Cook &amp; Co. of Glasgow. He next served in the workshops and surveys of the Caledonian Railway before taking employment (1859&#150;62) as an assistant engineer on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway.<br>
<br>Success in an open competition led to Bell's appointment on 7 July 1862 to the Indian public works department as a probationary assistant engineer. He reached India in December 1862 where he was employed from 1862 to 1870 on the Grand Deccan Road in the Central Provinces during which, in April 1866, he was promoted to executive engineer fourth class (first class, March 1871). Railway work followed and he was among the early appointees to the state railway service initiated in 1870. In 1870 he participated in the Chanda and the Wardha valley railway surveys followed by service on the Indore (1870), the Punjab Northern (1874), Rajputana (1875), Sind (1876), and Neemuch (1878) state railways.<br>
<br>Promoted to superintending engineer third class in January 1880 (first class, March 1886) and chief engineer third class in October 1890 (first class, January 1892), he had charge of the Dacca&#150;Mymensingh railway surveys (1881&#150;4) during which he served, in August 1883, on a committee considering a scheme for the reorganization of the public works department engineering establishment. In the period 1884&#150;90 he held in rapid succession a series of important positions: testimony to his flexibility and competence. He had the engineering and managerial charge of the Tirhut State Railway (1884 and 1887&#150;8) and charge of the Nalhati railway (1884), and served as the acting director of the large North-Western Railway (1887). Stints as the engineer-in-chief of the surveys for the Great Western of India and the Mughal Sarai to Howrah railways followed (1888&#150;9). In August 1890 he went to Calcutta as the consulting engineer to the government of India for state railways. From January to April 1893 he served as officiating director-general of railways and deputy secretary from which he reverted to consulting engineer until his retirement in June 1894.<br>
<br>Bell possessed many friends and was considered to be a person of energy, technical ability, and administrative capacity: witness his promotions to high posts and his commendations by the government of India. He also wrote extensively on engineering and other topics, including unpublished reports and memoranda in his official capacity, and published articles, pamphlets, and a book. The book was the substantial and useful <span class="italic">Railway Policy in India</span> (1894). He wrote pamphlet length primers on economics (<span class="italic">The Laws of Wealth</span>, 1883) and government (<span class="italic">The Government of India: a Primer</span>, 3rd edn, 1893) that were adopted for Indian students in government schools.<br>
<br>After Bell retired he established himself as a private consulting engineer in London in which capacity he maintained a close contact with India. The Southern Punjab Railway and the Nilgiri mountain rack railway were among his clients. In quite a different sphere he provided advice regarding the construction of the Marconi masts at Poldhu in Cornwall, England. Made an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 March 1867 and transferred to the status of member on 30 January 1872 he was elected in 1897 to the institution's council, on which he served until his death on 10 April 1903. He died at 114 Lexham Gardens, Brompton, London, from heart disease, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Marcia Napier Ogilvy, one of their four sons, and three of their five daughters.<br>
