<span class="headword">Terne,  Christopher</span>  (1620/21&#150;1673), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Nathaniel Terne of Chatham, Kent, was born at Rochester, Kent. After schooling at Rochester he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 4 April 1636, aged fifteen, graduating BA in 1640 and MA in 1643. He entered the University of Leiden on 22 July 1647, and there graduated MD. In May 1650 he was incorporated first at Cambridge and then at Oxford. Terne was examined as a candidate at the College of Physicians on 10 May 1650, and was elected a fellow on 15 November 1655. He was elected assistant physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 13 May 1653 and held office until 1669. He married Susan, daughter of Henry Borne.<br>
<br>Terne was appointed lecturer on anatomy to the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company in 1656, and in 1663 Samuel Pepys heard him lecture &#145;upon the Kidnys, urethers, and yard, which was very fine&#146;  (Pepys, 4.59). Terne's &#145;Praelectio prima ad chirurgos&#146; and his other lectures (nos. 1917&#150;21), written in a beautiful hand, are preserved in the Sloane collection in the British Library. The lectures, dated 1656, begin with an account of the skin, going on to the deeper parts, and were delivered contemporaneously with the dissection of a body on the table. Several volumes of notes of his extensive medical reading are preserved in the same collection (nos. 1887, 1890, and 1897), together with an important essay entitled &#145;An respiratio inserviat nutritioni?&#146;. He delivered the Harveian oration (1662&#150;3?) at the College of Physicians, in which, as in his lectures, he spoke with the utmost reverence of William Harvey. The oration exists in manuscript (Sloane MS 1903). Terne also wrote some Latin verses on Christopher Bennet, which were placed below his portrait in the <span class="italic">Theatrum Tabidorum</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 8 October 1662. Terne died at his house in Lime Street, London, on 1 December 1673, and was buried in St Andrew Undershaft.<br>
<br>Terne's daughter Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1712) married the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3670/', "Edward Browne")</script>. Terne's library was sold on 12 April 1686 with that of Dr Thomas Allen. See <span class="italic">Bibliothecae medicae, sive, Catalogus libolum &hellip; Christ. Terne</span> (1686).<br>
