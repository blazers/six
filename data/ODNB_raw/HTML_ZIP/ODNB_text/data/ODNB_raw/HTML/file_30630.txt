<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barton, Sir  Edmund</span>  (1849&#150;1920), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born at Glebe, Sydney, New South Wales, on 18 January 1849, youngest son of William Barton, Australia's first stockbroker, and his wife, Mary Louisa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Whydah), a schoolteacher. Known familiarly as Toby, he was educated at Sydney grammar school (1859&#150;64), and after a brilliant career at Sydney University (BA 1868, MA 1870) was called to the bar in 1871. On 28 December 1877, he married Jean Mason Ross (1851&#150;1938), daughter of David Ross, an engineer of Newcastle, New South Wales; they had four sons and two daughters. Barton proved himself a devoted family man.<br>
<br>Professional success came slowly, but, a keen cricketer, Barton caught the public eye by his tactful umpiring of a contentious game between New South Wales and a touring English eleven in 1879. Later that year he entered the New South Wales legislative assembly as member for Sydney University; he subsequently represented Wellington (1880&#150;82), East Sydney (1882&#150;7, 1891&#150;4), and Hastings and Macleay (1898&#150;1900). He was a member of the nominated legislative council in 1887&#150;91 and 1897&#150;8. A moderate Protectionist, he was speaker of the legislative assembly in 1883&#150;7 and attorney-general for seven weeks in 1889 under George Richard Dibbs.<br>
<br>Previously seen as an amiable dilettante in politics, Barton found his energies roused by the first federal convention in Sydney in March&#150;April 1891. He was one of the small committee who largely drafted the federal constitution, and his federalist credentials were endorsed by the veteran premier Sir Henry Parkes, who, although a political opponent, urged Barton to take on the leadership of the movement. Again attorney-general under the anti-federalist Dibbs from October 1891 to December 1893, Barton accepted office only on the assurance of a free hand to promote the federal cause. Although the legislative assembly assented to the main principles of the <span class="roman">Constitution Bill</span> drafted at the Sydney convention, the movement stagnated in the face of a severe commercial depression and widespread industrial disputes. Barton, acting-premier for four months in 1892, incurred the mistrust of the labour movement through his handling of a bitter miners' strike at Broken Hill. Throughout the 1890s the labour movement was largely anti-federalist, fearing that a central government would favour employers.<br>
<br>Hoping to mobilize public opinion and thus to stimulate parliamentary action, Barton established the Federation League in Sydney in mid-1893. Working-class republicans attempted to take over the first meeting, but their influence soon dwindled; and on 31 July 1893 a conference of federalists at Corowa, on the border of New South Wales and Victoria, adopted the strategy of urging the popular election of delegates to a second federal convention to revise and adopt the draft constitution. From 1894 to 1897 Barton was out of parliament and in financial difficulties, and it was largely due to his rival George Houston Reid that a conference of premiers at Hobart in February 1895 agreed to the Corowa formula. When the New South Wales delegates were elected Barton was returned at the head of the poll; and at the meeting of the convention at Adelaide on 18 March 1897 he was chosen to draw up the preliminary resolutions and act as leader of the convention.<br>
<br>During this convention and its subsequent sessions at Sydney (September 1897) and Melbourne (January&#150;March 1898) Barton was on top of his form. As chairman of both the constitutional and the drafting committees he was largely responsible for the revised <span class="roman">Constitution Bill</span>. A tactful manager of business and adroit lobbyist, he greatly facilitated the achievement of consensus, notably in securing an acceptable compromise over the respective powers of the senate, or states' house, and the popularly elected house of representatives. In New South Wales, which had most to lose as the only free-trade colony among protectionist neighbours, he was less successful. Nominated to the legislative council in 1897 as a spokesman for federation, he disliked the council's numerous and unwelcome amendments to the bill. During the referendum campaign in New South Wales in 1898 he stumped the country, coining the phrase: &#145;A nation for a continent and a continent for a nation&#146;; but at the poll on 3 June a sufficient majority was not attained.<br>
<br>Considering Reid as premier too lukewarm for federation, Barton stood against him in the East Sydney seat at the July 1898 elections. He was defeated, but came into the legislative assembly at a by-election for a rural constituency in September 1898, and William Lyne relinquished the leadership of the Protectionist Party to him. Finding the partisanship required of a leader of the opposition incompatible with his role as spokesman for federation, Barton stood down in favour of Lyne, who in September 1899 managed to detach the Labor Party from its support of Reid and replace him as premier. Barton meanwhile led the &#145;Yes&#146; campaign at a second federation referendum in 1899, this time successfully. He also campaigned in Queensland and took a prominent part in negotiations to bring in Western Australia.<br>
<br>In 1900 Barton went to London as leading member of the deputation which watched the passage of the <span class="roman">Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Bill</span> through the British parliament. He led the majority of the delegates in a bid to preserve section 74 of the constitution, making the future high court of Australia the final court of appeal on cases involving constitutional interpretation, but eventually accepted Joseph Chamberlain's compromise formula retaining the privy council in certain specified areas. Many saw Barton as the first prime minister of a federated Australia, but the governor-general, Lord Hopetoun, in December 1900 invited Lyne, as premier of the senior colony, to form a ministry. Unsupported by leading politicians elsewhere in Australia, Lyne failed and Barton was sworn in on 1 January 1901 as prime minister and minister for external affairs.<br>
<br>Tall, erect, clean-shaven, with iron-grey hair and remarkably expressive eyes, the new prime minister looked the part of &#145;Australia's noblest son&#146;, as his admirers called him. To the less reverent he was Tosspot Toby, whose love of food and drink was reflected in an 18-stone portliness. Yet he was capable of sustained hard work, and he was probably the only contemporary politician able to take command of a crew of captains who were accustomed to leadership in their respective states, and whose sympathies ranged from radical to conservative. The first federal elections in March 1901 left the Australian Labor Party holding the balance of power between Barton's Protectionists and the Free-Traders led by Reid. Labor supported Barton until his resignation in September 1903.<br>
<br>The new parliament was opened in Melbourne on 9 May 1901 by the duke of York (later George V). In its first session it legislated for a white Australia policy, excluding non-Europeans and political undesirables through a dictation test. The sugar industry was compensated for its loss of Pacific island labour by tariff protection. The racism behind these policies went with a concern to protect working-class living standards, then among the highest in the world. South-east Australia's manufacturing industries, hit by the 1890s' depression, were protected by a scale of tariffs, at first moderate out of deference to rural interests. The new Australian commonwealth saw itself as a laboratory for social reform. In 1902 women gained the right to vote and stand for parliament. In 1903 legislation was prepared for a system of industrial arbitration and conciliation.<br>
<br>In 1902 Barton visited Europe for Edward VII's coronation; he returned as a GCMG but was criticized by protestants for an audience with Pope Leo XIII at which both participants spoke Latin. Weary of office, in September 1903 he accepted doctor's orders to quit politics, taking a seat on the newly created high court, but with characteristic modesty assigning the post of chief justice to Sir Samuel Griffith. In his early years on the bench, Barton was sometimes criticized as being a mere echo of Griffith, with whom he shared a tendency to resist encroachment of the commonwealth government's powers on state rights. After serving as acting chief justice in 1913 he took a more cautiously evolutionary and independent line. On Griffith's retirement in October 1919 Barton hoped to succeed him, but was disappointed. Shortly afterwards his health broke down. While on vacation in the Blue Mountains he died suddenly on 7 January 1920 of cerebral embolism, at the Hydro Majestic Hotel, Medlow Bath. He was buried at South Head cemetery, Sydney, after a state funeral, on 9 January.<br>
<br>Possessing natural dignity and great charm, Barton won a respect and affection uncommon among Australian politicians. Although a less creative statesman than his friend and contemporary Alfred Deakin, he was more than once the indispensable architect of consensus when the Australian commonwealth was shaped.<br>
