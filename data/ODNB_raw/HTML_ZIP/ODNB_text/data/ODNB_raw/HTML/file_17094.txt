<span class="headword">Lower, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1662), <span class="occ">playwright and translator</span>, was born in Cornwall, the only son of John Lower of Tremere (<i>c</i>.1584&#150;1645, the second of six sons of Thomas Lower of St Winnow) and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. before 1640). He was probably born about 1610; he may be the William Lower, son of John, baptized on 7 March 1609 at Constantine, Cornwall (about 20 miles south-west of St Winnow), but proof is lacking. There is no record of Lower at either Oxford or Cambridge, but his kinsman Dr Richard Lower told Anthony Wood that William &#145;spent some time in Oxon, in the condition of an Hospes for the sake of the public Library and Scholastic Company &hellip; but his Fancy being gay, he troubled himself not with the crabbed studies of Logic and Philosophy&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.272).<br>
<br>The documentary silence is broken by the publication in 1639 of Lower's first play, <span class="italic">The Phoenix in her Flames</span>, dedicated to the author's cousin, Thomas Lower. This play is a competent but conventional tragic romance set in Arabia, involving a kidnapped princess who falls in love with a hero reduced from his rightful station, a battle in which the hero rebuffs an enemy army, and a tragic ending in which all the main characters die. It has no major source, but shows the influence of Greek romances and Marlowe's <span class="italic">Tamburlaine</span>. The play displays considerable military knowledge, and in the dedication Lower implies that he had seen military service. In 1640 he was a lieutenant in the regiment of Sir Jacob Ashley in the army of the earl of Northumberland, and later that year, now a captain, he gave an account of his company's mutiny near Brackley.<br>
<br>For the next four years there is no record of Lower's activities; the outbreak of the civil war presumably put his literary endeavours on hold. In June 1644, now a lieutenant-colonel in the king's army and lieutenant-governor of Wallingford, he was ordered by the crown to levy a weekly tax of &pound;50 on the town of Reading for the garrison at Wallingford. When the town refused to pay, Lower kidnapped the mayor of Reading as a hostage. A series of letters ensued, in which the town's aldermen reiterated their inability to pay and Lower attempted without success to reach a compromise. Eventually the council of war at Oxford remitted part of the levy. On 27 March 1645 Lower was rewarded for his service by being knighted. Less than a year later, on 19 January 1646, he was captured by the parliamentary garrison of Abingdon and sent to London as a prisoner. He apparently remained there until 11 January 1647, when he was discharged and permitted to go overseas, as long as he promised not to act against the parliament.<br>
<br>Lower's whereabouts over the next seven years are unclear. At some point after 1647 he married and had a daughter, Elizabeth, but it is impossible to say exactly when or where this daughter was born, and nothing is known of his wife, except that she died before 1661. Lower probably spent some time in the Low Countries, since his uncle Sir Nicholas Lower owned lands in Holland and Zeeland. Sir Nicholas died in 1653, leaving most of his estate to Sir William and his cousin Thomas, but they encountered difficulties gaining title to their inheritance because of the wars. Lower was in England in July 1654 petitioning for permission to go to the Low Countries to settle his uncle's estate, but he had to wait more than a year before receiving it. He was in The Hague in October 1655, bringing news of Cromwell's weakness back in England, and he apparently stayed there for the next six years, finally resolving the estate difficulties in 1660.<br>
<br>During this time Lower began to publish translations of various French works. He translated three non-dramatic works of Ren&eacute; de Ceriziers concerning religious martyrs: <span class="italic">The Innocent Lady</span> (1654), <span class="italic">The Innocent Lord</span> (1655), and <span class="italic">The Triumphant Lady</span> (1656). He also translated two plays by Corneille (<span class="italic">Polyeuctes</span> in 1655 and <span class="italic">Horatius</span> in 1656), two by Paul Scarron (<span class="italic">Don Japhet of Armenia</span>, preserved as British Library Add. MS 28723, and <span class="italic">The Three Dorothies</span>, now lost), and two by Quinault (<span class="italic">The Noble Ingratitude</span> in 1659 and <span class="italic">The Amorous Fantasme</span> in 1660). The latter two were dedicated, respectively, to the princess royal of Orange (for whom Lower published a funeral elegy in 1661) and to Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, indicating Lower's close connection with the exiled royal family. In 1660 he translated a French description of Charles II's residence in Holland, publishing it in an elaborate engraved folio. In addition to his translations, Lower wrote a second original play, <span class="italic">The Enchanted Lovers</span> (1658). This is a pastoral set on the island of Erithrea, with lovers disguised as shepherds, enchantments, and the goddess Diana appearing as a <i>deus ex machina</i> at the end. The Folger copy of <span class="italic">The Noble Ingratitude</span> and <span class="italic">The Enchanted Lovers</span> (bound together, Folger L3314/Q218) is inscribed &#145;For Mris. Elizabeth Lower 1659&#146; and &#145;Corrected by the Author's own hand&#146;, with about fifteen manuscript corrections, all in Lower's hand. Lower also wrote a manuscript set of paraphrases on the apostolic epistles, preserved as Harleian MS 4611.<br>
<br>In 1661 Thomas Lower died and left most of his estate to his cousin Sir William, prompting the latter's return to England. Early the following year, however, Sir William himself died, and his will was proved on 7 May 1662. He left most of his estate to his daughter, Elizabeth, with trustees holding it until she turned twenty-one. Wood supposed that he was buried in St Clement Danes, Westminster  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.273), but there is no record of his burial there, nor in St Winnow, Cornwall.<br>
