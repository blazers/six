<span class="headword">Woodward,  Michael</span>  (1932&#150;1973), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, Chile, on 25 January 1932, the first of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Edward Gerard (Roy) Woodward (<i>d</i>. 1999), an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yriberry. His mother was Chilean (of Basque and Irish descent) and his father, who had been posted to Chile by his company in 1927, was the son of a British army officer; they had married in Chile in 1931, and remained there until 1947. Michael, who had dual nationality, spent the first fifteen years of his life in Chile. After attending a small school for English-speaking children in Vi&ntilde;a del Mar he was sent in 1941 as a boarder to the Grange School in Santiago (originally founded to prepare English-speaking boys for the examinations needed for entry to public schools in England). In 1947 his father arranged for him to travel to England and to study at Downside, a Catholic boarding school in Somerset. According to Michael's biographer, who was one of his friends at Downside, Roy Woodward always considered his son's home to be England  (Crouzet, 6); his Englishness, both in speech and manner, was commented on throughout his later life in Chile.<br>
<br>After completing his secondary schooling Woodward went on to study at King's College, London (1950&#150;53), where he obtained a pass degree in civil engineering. In 1954 he decided to go back to Chile to train as a priest. He entered the pontifical seminary in Santiago in March 1954 and was ordained to the subdiaconate in June 1960 and to the priesthood in February 1961. Between 1961 and 1963 he undertook a course at the Institut Sup&eacute;rieur de Cat&eacute;ch&eacute;tique in Paris, and returned to Chile in 1964 having &#145;discovered a completely new theology&#146;  (Crouzet, 30). A new understanding of what it meant to be a Christian emerged at this time; Latin America's traditionally conservative Catholic church began to take a greater interest in and to seek to change the lives of the poor. Institutionalized at the Second Vatican Council (1962&#150;5) and the Conference of Latin American Bishops in Medell&iacute;n (1968), the &#145;theology of liberation&#146; allowed for a dialogue between Christians and Marxists. Organized movements of Christian activists sought to use religion as a base from which to transform society. To their minds, Christian faith had to be linked to social action to be meaningful. In Chile as elsewhere, many priests spoke out against social injustices and sought to provide leadership to politically marginalized groups.<br>
<br>Woodward, who spent the years 1964 to 1966 at the chaplains' house at Valpara&iacute;so, was greatly influenced by and took an active part in such initiatives to construct a &#145;church of the people&#146;. In June 1966 he was appointed priest of the parish of Pe&ntilde;a Blanca, a small suburban town near Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, where he became involved in the religious education provided by local schools, began to work with youth groups in the area, and used scriptural quotations to emphasize God's love for the poor. In April 1969 he visited Europe on leave, and when he returned to Chile later in the year he left his parish, and moved to Cerro Placeres in Valpara&iacute;so. He joined a movement of priests called Christians for Socialism (who claimed that the aims of a true Christian were essentially socialist) and found employment as a lathe operator in a shipyard, where he took a particular interest in providing educational opportunities for the workers.<br>
<br>During the first year of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende, elected in September 1970, Woodward taught physics and mathematics in the Centre for Studies and Industrial Training (CESCLA), a department of the Catholic University of Valpara&iacute;so. Its objective was to enable workers to gain a university qualification. He also became a member of a local action group linked to the Unified Movement for Political Action (MAPU), which was involved in land occupations after the earthquake that damaged Valpara&iacute;so in July 1971. Later he was nominated president of his neighbourhood council's provision and price committee, a response to the food shortages and the exorbitant prices of black market goods that plagued Allende's administration (the committees attempted to supply essential foods to people at affordable prices).<br>
<br>Woodward was formally suspended from the priesthood by Bishop Emilio Tagle in August 1972. Just over a year later, on 11 September 1973, Allende's socialist experiment was brought to an abrupt halt by a violent military coup. The government of the junta of the armed forces declared that Allende's government had &#145;engendered a blind, fratricidal struggle based on ideas alien to our national heritage&#146; (that is socialism); it proclaimed that the &#145;internal and external security of the country [was] in dire peril&#146;, that its &#145;very existence as an independent state [was] in danger&#146;  (&#145;The reasons of the junta&#146;, reproduced in Loveman and Davies). Through his involvement with radicalized church organizations and as a leader of a pro-Allende neighbourhood council, Woodward was doubtless regarded as part of the &#145;subversive threat&#146; that the military junta intended to eliminate.<br>
<br>There are disputed accounts as to when Woodward was arrested. In 1991 the report of the Chilean national commission on truth and reconciliation (also known as the Rettig commission), which investigated human rights abuses resulting in death or disappearance during the years of military rule, concluded that he was arrested by a naval patrol at Cerro los Placeres on 16 September 1973. Subsequently it has been suggested that he was not arrested until 22 September  (Crouzet). There is, however, a consensus about what happened to Woodward once he was arrested: he was interrogated and tortured aboard the <i>Esmeralda</i>, a naval training ship, and died later on 22 September 1973 at the naval hospital at Valaparaiso from internal injuries sustained during his torture. (The official death certificate recorded his death as having taken place on the public highway at Valaparaiso on 22 September, from &#145;cardio-respiratory arrest&#146;.) He was buried in a pauper's grave at the edge of the cemetery of Playa Ancha, though his body has never been found. In November 2008 nineteen former naval officials were arrested and charged with his murder.<br>
