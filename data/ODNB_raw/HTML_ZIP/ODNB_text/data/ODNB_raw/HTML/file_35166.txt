<span class="headword">Murray family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1768&#150;1967), <span class="occ">publishers</span>, was an important book trade dynasty famous for publishing the works of Byron, the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>.<br>
<br>The house of Murray was established in the late eighteenth century by <a name="cosubject_17699"></a><span class="headword">John Murray <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>McMurray; </span></span> <span class="st"> John [i] Murray]</span>  (1737&#150;1793), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, who was born at Edinburgh on 1 January 1737, the only surviving son of Robert McMurray (1698&#150;1768), lawyer, and Jean (<i>bap</i>. 1703, <i>d</i>. 1742), daughter of James Ross of Dundee and Elizabeth Philips. There were three elder daughters, Elizabeth, Janet, and Robina. In 1768 when Murray established himself in business at London he dropped the prefix &#145;Mc&#146; from his name. He matriculated at Edinburgh University for one term in 1752. In the following year he began a career in the marines that led to a commission in July 1762. Little is known of his service during the Seven Years' War, after which he retired on half pay. On 3 March 1763 he married, at Chatham, Nancy (<i>bap</i>. 1745, <i>d</i>. 1776), daughter of Captain William Weemss and Ann Weber of Brompton, near Chatham. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>Murray's search for gainful employment separated him from his wife and brought him to the north of Scotland to work on the Gordonstoun estate and afterwards to Edinburgh, where job opportunities eluded him. He occupied himself in writing a short novel, &#145;The History of Sir Launcelot Edgevile&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Court Miscellany</span>, and a pamphlet on the Edinburgh theatre, but realized that he lacked the talent to pursue a literary career with any chance of success. In the spring of 1766 he returned to England and reluctantly was reinstated in the marines at Chatham.<br>
<br>In October 1768 Murray learned that the well-established London bookselling business of William Sandby at 32 Fleet Street could be bought for &pound;1000. With &pound;700, the sum of his wife's dowry, and the additional funds borrowed from friends, he ventured upon a career about which he knew little or nothing. To the poet William Falconer, who declined to be a partner, he remarked: &#145;Many blockheads in the trade are making fortunes&#146;  (Murray letter-book, 16 Oct 1768). Murray's first publication was the fifth edition of Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span>, a title Sandby had first published in 1760. From his bookshop Murray also sold stationery, and at different times dealt in medicines, lottery tickets, Irish linen, Tassie's gems, beer, wine, and game birds.<br>
<br>The House of Lords decision of 1774 on literary property enabled Murray to exploit the market for reprinting. He produced inexpensive editions of the poems of Thomas Gray in 1776 and James Thomson in 1778, both enhanced with illustrations and critical assessments. He also bought into such large-scale ventures as the <span class="italic">Works of the English Poets</span>, edited by Samuel Johnson. A legal dispute in 1777 with the Revd William Mason over the copyright in three short poems in the Gray edition led Murray to defend himself in public with <span class="italic">A Letter to W. Mason Concerning &hellip; the Practices of Booksellers</span>, but in the court of chancery he lost the case.<br>
<br>In 1775 an inheritance of more than &pound;2000, his share of the proceeds from the sale of an Irish estate belonging to his maternal uncle, enabled Murray to expand his business. He had published a dozen titles in 1772, a figure which rose to over forty by 1778 and continued to increase. Murray published about 1000 titles during a twenty-five-year career. More than one-third contain his name alone in the imprint. The others reflect deals he made with traders either in London or in cities such as Edinburgh and Dublin.<br>
<br>Murray published in many fields, but medical and scientific titles account for one-quarter of his output. The names of William Cullen, Gilbert Blane, C. B. Tyre, and James Wood were foremost in his lists. He also published translations of important continental books, such as those by Karl Scheele and Torbern Bergman. The <span class="italic">Medical Commentaries</span>, a quarterly publication edited by Andrew Duncan, was established by Murray in 1773 and achieved a wide circulation for many years. One of Murray's most ambitious and successful undertakings was his edition of Lavater's <span class="italic">Essays on Physiognomy</span>, published in forty-one parts and sold by subscription over a period of ten years beginning in 1788. It was a lavish production with hundreds of engravings by the leading artists of the day, including Gillray and Blake.<br>
<br>The real money Murray made from fiction, poetry, and drama came from buying shares with other booksellers and reprinting the works of such writers as Shakespeare, Milton, Defoe, Fielding, Sterne, and Smollett. In the historical line he published several Scottish writers including John Millar, Gilbert Stuart, and Sir David Dalrymple, but it was his regret that a history as popular as those written by Hume, Robertson, or Gibbon eluded him.<br>
<br>As a means of promoting his own publications, and as investments in their own right, Murray involved himself in several periodical publications. The most successful of these was the <span class="italic">English Review</span>. Edited by Murray himself, it was established in January 1783 and continued monthly until 1797, when it merged with Joseph Johnson's <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span>. Although essentially a literary journal, Murray included a political article each month that was a cogent summary of national and international affairs. William Godwin wrote this article until Murray dismissed him, and in other departments of the <span class="italic">English Review</span> Murray employed such men as Thomas Holcroft and Thomas Beddoes.<br>
<br>Whenever an issue arose about which Murray felt strongly, his instinct was to write about it, either in a letter to a newspaper or magazine or in a separate pamphlet. Disputes with authors and other traders occupied his pen, but on other occasions he felt moved to write on such topics as the Hume&#150;Rousseau controversy and the affairs of the East India Company. As well as the <span class="italic">Letter to W. Mason</span> (2nd edn, 1788), he wrote three separate publications: <span class="italic">A Letter &hellip; Occasioned by the late Theatrical Disturbances</span> (1766); <span class="italic">An Author's Conduct to the Public, Stated in the Behaviour of Dr. William Cullen</span> (1784); and the <span class="italic">Defence of Innes Munro</span> (1790).<br>
<br>During his marriage to Nancy Weemss, Murray fathered a child with another woman. He supported this boy, named Archibald, and later established him in a career at sea. Murray's wife died of consumption in September 1776, and on 23 February 1778 he married her younger sister Hester Weemss (<i>bap</i>. 1746, <i>d</i>. 1815), who had lived with the Murrays in London at different times. With Hester he had seven children, three of whom survived to maturity. The first, <a href="#cosubject_19634">John [ii] [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who carried on the business, arrived just nine months after their marriage. A daughter, Jane, followed in 1780 and another girl, Mary Anne, was born in 1787. In May 1782 Murray suffered a life-threatening stroke. Since his days in the marines, evenings of sometimes excessive drinking in such London establishments as the Peacock Tavern in Gray's Inn Lane and at Munday's Coffee House had taken a physical toll. However, he regained his health and by heeding this warning lived ten further years.<br>
<br>Murray died on 6 November 1793 after an illness of several months. He was buried across the street from his shop at St Dunstan-in-the-West. Under the name of his widow, Hester, the business was run by Murray's long-serving shop assistant, Samuel Highley. Hester Murray is listed in several imprints in 1794 and 1795, but she published little of consequence. At his death Murray's estate was valued at more than &pound;12,000, but a legal dispute with his partners in Lavater's <span class="italic">Essays on Physiognomy</span> reduced this figure by nearly &pound;4000. His correspondence and other papers are preserved in the firm's archive.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_19634"></a><span class="headword">John Samuel Murray</span> <span class="st"> [John [ii] Murray]</span>  (1778&#150;1843), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 27 November 1778 at 32 Fleet Street, London, the eldest and only surviving legitimate son of John [i] Murray and his second wife, Hester. He was educated at private schools in Cobham, Uxbridge, Edinburgh, Margate, Gosport, and finally in Kennington, London. While at Gosport Murray lost the sight in his right eye when it was accidentally pierced by his writing master's penknife. During visits home he was put to work in the bookshop.<br>
<br>When his father died in November 1793 Murray, who was not quite fifteen, was apprenticed to Samuel Highley, his father's assistant, and an agreement was drawn up by which Murray, when he came of age in 1799, would become a full partner of Highley. Under this arrangement the business continued along much the same lines as under its founder, focusing primarily on medical works. Murray became free of the Stationers' Company on 2 December 1800, and was immediately cloathed in the livery. By this time the firm of Murray and Highley had amassed over &pound;2300 in capital stock, shares, and copyrights. However, the two partners &#145;disagreed on too many important matters to work together effectively or live happily in the same house&#146;  (Zachs, 248). On 24 March 1803, following arbitration, they formally separated, Highley establishing himself as a medical publisher a few doors down at 24 Fleet Street.<br>
<br>Murray's first publication of importance after the dissolution of the partnership was <span class="italic">The Revolutionary Plutarch</span>, which was warmly received. In 1805 an old family friend, Mrs Maria Eliza Rundell, offered him a collection of recipes which he published as <span class="italic">A New System of Domestic Cookery</span>. It was an immediate success. Although Mrs Rundell originally had regarded the work as a &#145;free gift&#146; to Murray  (Smiles, 2.121), its copyright became a bone of contention unresolved until 1823, when Murray paid her &pound;2000.<br>
<br>In 1803 Murray began a correspondence with the Edinburgh publisher Archibald Constable. Soon afterwards a close working relationship developed, and Murray took over from Longmans the London agency of Constable's publications, including the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. When Constable offered Walter Scott &pound;1000 for the copyright of <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, a quarter share was offered to William Miller of 50 Albemarle Street (to where Murray moved in 1812) and the other quarter to Murray, which he took up. However, the business relationship between Murray and Constable began to sour over financial matters and finally broke off in 1813.<br>
<br>In February 1809 Murray launched the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, a tory counterblast to Constable's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, with William Gifford as its first editor and Walter Scott as an adviser and supporter. Because Gifford was an unbusinesslike editor, and the publication of the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> was often delayed, it was several years before it succeeded. One of the most influential journals of the age, it did not cease publication until 1967. Among the important early contributors were John Wilson Croker, John Barrow, and Robert Southey. Gifford resigned in 1824 and was succeeded briefly by John Taylor Coleridge. J. G. Lockhart, Scott's son-in-law, then took up the editorship. Murray's attempt at a daily newspaper in 1825, <span class="italic">The Representative</span>, was a costly failure. Young Benjamin Disraeli, the editor, persuaded him to take a half share, but competition was too great, and debts forced Murray to sell his recently acquired house in Whitehall Place. The coolness that this caused in Murray's long-standing family friendship with Isaac D'Israeli was soon repaired.<br>
<br>During visits to Edinburgh, Murray courted Anne (1782&#150;1845), daughter of the late Charles Elliot, the Scottish bookseller with whom his father had done much business. They were married in Edinburgh on 6 March 1807, and their son <a href="#cosubject_19637">John [iii] [<i>see below</i>]</a> was born in London on 16 April 1808, the first of five children.<br>
<br>Murray's move to 50 Albemarle Street in June 1812 placed him at the centre of London literary life. He purchased the early eighteenth-century house from William Miller for just under &pound;4000, pledging his copyright in Rundell's <span class="italic">Domestic Cookery</span> and Scott's <span class="italic">Marmion</span> until the purchase was paid off in 1821. The elegant drawing room became a meeting place for many of the chief literary and political figures of the day, among them Thomas Moore, George Crabbe, Robert Southey, Madame de Sta&euml;l, George Canning, and Benjamin Disraeli. It was there on 7 April 1815 that Lord Byron and Walter Scott first met.<br>
<br>No author is more closely associated with the house of Murray than Byron. On his return to England in July 1811 the poet gave the first two cantos of <span class="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span> to Robert Charles Dallas, who was duly impressed and offered them without success to the publisher William Miller. He then took the manuscript to Murray, who paid Dallas &pound;500 for the copyright and published the poem in March 1812. In the wake of <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>'s success, a warm relationship developed between poet and publisher. Byron's best-known works appeared under the firm's imprint, and Murray, who paid out more than &pound;15,000 for Byron's copyrights, prospered from the sale of his works. In July 1819 he published with some trepidation the first two cantos of <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, and with considerably more, cantos 3&#150;5 in August 1821. Thereafter Murray refused to have anything further to do with the poem. With the breakdown of Byron's marriage in 1816 and his (self-) exile in Italy, their friendship was sustained in a correspondence that is one of the most lively and revealing of the period  (<span class="italic">Byron's Letters and Journals</span>, ed. L. Marchand, 1973&#150;94). However, this friendship collapsed in 1822 over Murray's editing (on the advice of Gifford and Croker) of Byron's poetry and his careless handling of the text. Nor were matters helped by Byron's increasing outspokenness, Murray's concern with his own rising reputation, and the difficulty in resolving differences at a distance.<br>
<br>In 1820 Moore was offered 2000 guineas by Murray for Byron's memoir, which the poet had given him on the condition that it was not published in his lifetime. Gifford advised the publisher that some of it was unfit for publication, and after Byron's death a meeting was held on 17 May 1824 at Albemarle Street at which, after heated discussion, it was reluctantly agreed to burn the manuscript. Those present were Murray, his son John, Moore, John Cam Hobhouse, and representatives of Lady Byron and Augusta Leigh.<br>
<br>Murray's range of publications was very wide. His judgement, supported by the recommendations of his distinguished literary advisers, was usually good. In addition to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, Murray issued the <span class="italic">Journal of Science and the Arts</span> for the Royal Institution, and from 1813 the <span class="italic">Navy List</span>, describing himself as &#145;Bookseller to the Admiralty&#146;. Murray's <span class="roman">Family Library</span>, published between 1829 and 1834, was a venture in producing cheaper books for a wider reading public. This series of almost fifty volumes, priced at 5<i>s</i>. each, largely contained new works rather than reprints.<br>
<br>Among the better-known poets and playwrights in Murray's lists were Crabbe (to whom he was very generous), Coleridge, Gally Knight, Fanny Kemble, and Felicia Hemans. Among scientists he published Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday, Charles Babbage, Roderick Murchison, Mary Somerville, and Charles Lyell, whose <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span> (1830) was in print for most of the century and who introduced Charles Darwin to Murray. Among political economists Murray published Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and John Austin, whose brilliant wife, Sarah, translated many works from the German for Murray.<br>
<br>Another popular speciality of the firm was travel literature. Murray published books on Africa by Mungo Park, John Lewis Burckhardt, and Dixon Denham and Hugh Clapperton. In the field of polar exploration Sir John Barrow and Sir John Franklin were Murray authors. He also published Sir Gardner Wilkinson on ancient Egypt, William Martin Leake on Morea, T. Stamford Raffles on Java, and Elizabeth Rigby (Lady Eastlake) on Russia. Mariana Starke's <span class="italic">Travels on the Continent</span>, first published in 1820, was a precursor to the popular Murray <span class="roman">Handbook</span> series later developed by John [iii] Murray. Murray also published the travel writings of Mrs Maria Graham (Lady Callcott), better known for her enduring <span class="italic">Little Arthur's History of England</span>.<br>
<br>In 1814 Murray published Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span> and the second edition of <span class="italic">Mansfield Park</span> for the author, charging her his commission of 10 per cent. On the same terms he issued <span class="italic">Northanger Abbey</span> and <span class="italic">Persuasion</span> posthumously. He brought out Madame de Sta&euml;l's <span class="italic">De l'Allemagne</span> at great speed in 1813, commissioning at least seven printers for the English and French three-volume sets. The novels of the indomitable Frances Trollope were also published by Murray, and it was with his influence that her son Anthony obtained employment with the Post Office.<br>
<br>Murray issued several part-publications, in which illustrations were an important element. For these he engaged such well-known artists as J. M. W. Turner, A. W. Callcott, Charles Barry, and the engravers William and Edward Finden on several projects. A number of these illustrated books&#151;notably beginning in 1819 with James Hakewill's <span class="italic">Picturesque Tour of Italy</span>, and continuing with the popular <span class="italic">Landscape Illustrations</span> of Byron and of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#151;were issued in parts in very large numbers.<br>
<br>The extensive record Murray left of his career as a publisher&#151;correspondence, ledgers, daybooks, subscription books, records of trade dinners&#151;shows him businesslike and systematic in his dealings with authors, employees, and other traders. Such was his success &#145;that he is sometimes mistakenly credited with having established the house&#146;  (Zachs, 1). Murray was a founder member of the Athenaeum Club. He died on 27 June 1843, leaving all his property, including his profitable share in the Stationers' Company English stock, to his wife, Anne, who died two years later. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_19637"></a><span class="headword">John Murray</span> <span class="st"> [John [iii] Murray]</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 16 April 1808 at 32 Fleet Street, London, the eldest of the five children of John [ii] Murray and his wife, Anne. From 1819 to 1826 he was educated at Charterhouse School. In 1827 he spent a year at Edinburgh University, where his chief study was of geology and mineralogy. He also explored much of Scotland, making careful notes of features of interest and setting a pattern for future travels.<br>
<br>In the following year Murray embarked on his career in the family publishing house at 50 Albemarle Street, London. Visits to the continent from 1829 prepared the way for his first major publishing initiative. Struck by the difficulty of obtaining the kind of information he wanted, he filled notebooks with history, architecture, geology, and practical details. On his return he arranged his material along routes and compiled general accounts of the countries concerned, leading to the highly successful series of Murray &#145;handbooks&#146;. Before the project outgrew the capacities of one man, he prepared three handbooks himself, dealing with the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland; another, on France, followed later. The series was launched in 1836, at an auspicious time when railways were beginning to open up new possibilities for travel. Within fifteen years these red handbooks covered nearly the whole of the continent. Karl Baedeker, in producing his own guides, acknowledged his debt to the Murray model.<br>
<br>The handbooks fitted well with the publishing policy that developed during Murray's early years with the firm. His father, chastened by memories of financial setbacks in the 1820s, cast an increasingly jaundiced eye on verse and fiction and chose to opt out of that volatile if expanding market. This disposition was shared by the son: he had met Byron, Scott, and Goethe, but cared little for novels (other than Scott's) or poetry. Physically, too, his field of vision had long been constricted, and Lord Ernle described him as having &#145;the most strained and tired-looking eyes&#146; he had ever seen  (Paston, xiii). This did not prevent him grappling diligently with manuscripts and small print. He was a less adventurous man of business than his father had been in his heyday, but more methodical. Though initially kept in the background, he conducted most of the office correspondence and played a leading role as his father's health failed. On becoming head of the firm in June 1843 he found that his father's will left all property to his mother, putting him in the position of having to buy the business back from her and pay annual interest in the mean time. He felt obliged to postpone thoughts of marriage, and only after his mother's death did he propose to Marion Smith (1815&#150;1893), an Edinburgh banker's daughter whom he had known for many years. They married on 6 July 1847; 50 Albemarle Street remained his home. Two daughters and two sons survived to maturity. In due course the sons, <a href="#cosubject_35166">John [iv] [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Hallam, joined their father and his cousin Robert Cooke as partners in the firm. In 1851, out of profits from the handbooks, Murray bought 4 acres at Wimbledon on which he built a house. He named it Newstead after Byron's Newstead Abbey, and endowed it with a fine library. From then on the family spent the summer months there. Both at Albemarle Street and in Wimbledon the Murrays entertained frequently, bringing together well-known people from a variety of backgrounds, regardless of whether they had any business connection with the firm.<br>
<br>What Murray did inherit from his father was high standing in the publishing world, a select back list, and a considerable number of distinguished friends and authors who were staunch supporters, such as Henry Hallam, Dean Milman, Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John Barrow, and Lord Mahon (later Earl Stanhope), while J. G. Lockhart and John Wilson Croker continued to act as pillars of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Murray's accession brought no major policy changes. Travel, history, biography, and memoirs remained the staple of the business. Nor did the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>'s politics change, although its tone became less partisan after Croker's retirement. When Gladstone complained in 1868 about some rough handling in its pages, Murray reminded his friend that it was not the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> that had changed over the decades, for it &#145;continues doggedly to its old Conservative principles&#146;  (Paston, 208). One project did offer an immediate opportunity to signalize the change of management in 1843. This was the idea, discussed in only general terms before his father's death, of a cheap series aimed in part but not wholly at colonial customers, to take advantage of the 1842 <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span>'s provisions against foreign piracy of British copyright works. Three months after Murray's accession, his <span class="roman">Colonial and Home Library</span> made a scrambled d&eacute;but with a new edition of George Borrow's <span class="italic">The Bible in Spain</span> as its flagship title. Colonial sales failed to live up to expectations, but home demand was sufficient to ensure that the series survived for some sixty years, although in an attenuated form.<br>
<br>The solid Murray reputation attracted a continuing flow of manuscripts. Much of the routine of assessing and retouching new material fell to one or other of Murray's readers or literary advisers. Since 1841 Frances Trollope's brother Henry Milton had acted in that capacity; he was succeeded in 1850 by his son John (later Sir John Milton). The firm's concentration on non-fiction meant that certain types of manuscript were shut out almost automatically. The survivors had to circumvent a number of other pitfalls. Murray was a loyal, old-fashioned churchman, and would have nothing to do with irreligion or anything that appeared offensive to morals or good taste. He refused Kinglake's <span class="italic">Eothen</span> because of its &#145;wicked spirit of jesting at everything&#146;  (CUL, Add. 7633.4, 1844) and Harriet Martineau's <span class="italic">Eastern Life: Present and Past</span> because it was &#145;a work of infidel tendency&#146;  (Murray letter-book, 29 Feb 1848). When published elsewhere, both succeeded, and stirred no outcry. Murray was also a stickler for authenticity. Herman Melville, whose <span class="italic">Typee</span> and <span class="italic">Omoo</span> he published, was one travel writer who was pressed for evidence that he had actually experienced all he described, and was dropped after he appeared to stray into the world of romance. On the other hand, Murray, once convinced, was quick to spring to the defence of an author such as Paul Du Chaillu, whose stories of gorillas in his <span class="italic">Explorations and Adventures in Central Africa</span> were initially scoffed at by disbelievers.<br>
<br>The 1840s had seen an infusion of new attitudes into British publishing, but Murray was conservative in business. He won only hollow victories from litigation against those who ignored his claim to copyright in certain American authors, an area shrouded in legal confusion. He was a strong upholder of retail price maintenance, until that was overthrown in 1852 by an arbitration decision (none the sweeter for coming from three Murray authors led by Lord Campbell). His response to new developments sometimes seemed improvised, as with <span class="roman">Murray's Railway Reading</span>, consisting mostly of reprinted works issued irregularly from 1851 and varying in size, price, and binding.<br>
<br>None the less, Murray achieved considerable success in the firm's chosen niche, aided by his authors' recognition of fair dealing. Among those he enlisted were George Melville, Charles Darwin, Lord Campbell, A. H. Layard, Robert Curzon, John Motley, Samuel Smiles, David Livingstone, George Grote, Isabella Bird, Paul Belloni Du Chaillu, Dean Arthur Stanley, and Heinrich Schliemann&#151;a spread of names typical of the areas in which Murray's commercial and personal interests lay. In November 1859 he managed to put two best-sellers on sale on the same day, one being Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>, perhaps the most momentous book of the century, and the other Samuel Smiles's <span class="italic">Self-Help</span>, synonymous with the Victorian social ethic. A number of these authors, alongside other notable writers, also appeared in the pages of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, edited by Lockhart until Whitwell Elwin took over in 1853. Another stalwart of Albemarle Street, William Smith, combined editing the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> from 1867 to 1893 with maintaining his remarkable array of dictionaries, in which Murray invested much capital.<br>
<br>Publishing an author like Darwin was scarcely undertaken in a crusading spirit. The manuscript of <span class="italic">The Origin of Species</span> left Murray perplexed and sceptical, but he prudently suppressed his doubts and forged a relationship with Darwin that was profitable to both. Lyell's <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span>, published by his father in Murray's early days with the firm, and popular ever since, had laid some of the foundations on which Darwin built. Geology was Murray's favourite hobby, but it was also one of the most strife-ridden sciences of his day. Concerned to leave geological room for an act of creation, he wrote his <span class="italic">Scepticism in Geology</span> to counteract Lyell's concept of a world slowly and constantly changing, and issued it under a pseudonym (Verifier) in 1877.<br>
<br>Apart from the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, which long outlived him, Murray's experience with periodicals was disappointing. In 1869 he provided the capital for a new literary monthly, <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, but could not persuade its editor, Charles Appleton, to lighten its severely scholarly tone. Murray withdrew from the venture within a year, but did not abandon the idea of having his own monthly. When <span class="italic">Murray's Magazine</span> appeared in January 1887, he made sure it was pitched at a more accessible level; and, as serialization had become a standard part of the magazine formula, the house ban on fiction was suddenly breached. In 1887 Murray took over, from Blackwoods, Emily Lawless's Irish novel <span class="italic">Hurrish</span>, and used her next novel, <span class="italic">Major Lawrence, F.L.S.</span>, as the opening serial in the new magazine. Five more followed from other authors, but before the fifth had run its course the magazine closed in December 1891.<br>
<br>Throughout his life one of Murray's chief pleasures was foreign travel, and one of his great restoratives was walking. He was elected a member of the Alpine Club in 1858. A man of robust constitution, he never formally retired from active publishing, but when he was eighty-three his health began seriously to decline. He died at 50 Albemarle Street on 2 April 1892 and was buried on 6 April at St Mary's Church, Wimbledon. He lacked the panache of his father in his glory days, but Elizabeth Rigby's assessment at the time of his father's death proved accurate: &#145;in all that concerns the stability of the great publishing-house, his son is quite fitted to take his place&#146;  (Paston, 38).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_35166"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Murray</span> <span class="st"> [John [iv] Murray]</span>  (1851&#150;1928), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at 50 Albemarle Street, London, on 18 December 1851, the eldest son of the five children of John [iii] Murray and his wife, Marion. His childhood was spent largely at the family home, Newstead.<br>
<br>Murray was sent to Eton College, and in 1870 he entered Magdalen College, Oxford. His father, anxious that his son should lose no time in joining the firm, allowed him only two years at university. He prized the lifelong friendships he had made at Oxford and always maintained that his presidency of the Magdalen junior common room taught him to run a business. For the next twenty years he learned the trade, initially as his father's assistant and then spending time in each department. During his training he helped to edit the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and worked on revisions of the handbooks to London and Scotland. He became a partner in 1878.<br>
<br>On 4 March 1878 Murray married Katherine Evelyn (Evie) (<i>d</i>. 1938) of Warthill, Aberdeenshire, fourth daughter of William Leslie, sometime MP for Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Matilda. This prompted the comment that the Murrays always returned to Scotland for their wives. They had one son, <a href="#cosubject_64909">John [v] [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and two daughters, Amy Marion and Dorothy Evelyn. Mrs Murray was often ill with a depressive nervous condition.<br>
<br>Murray's younger brother, Alexander Henry Hallam Murray (1854&#150;1934), known as Hallam, joined the firm in 1876 and became a partner in 1884. He was educated at Eton College, at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and afterwards at the Slade School of Fine Art. A very accomplished landscape and architectural watercolour painter, and an admirer of Ruskin, he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884 and thereafter. In 1885 he married Alicia Maria Du Cane (1861&#150;1947) and settled at Sandling, Hythe, in Kent.<br>
<br>Upon the death of John [iii] Murray in April 1892, John [iv] Murray inherited five-eighths of the business and the Albemarle Street property, while the remaining three-eights, together with Newstead, went to Hallam. As a publisher Hallam's strengths lay largely in the decisions relating to typography, paper, printing, illustration, and binding. He became responsible for the production of the <span class="roman">Handbooks for Travellers</span>, and he himself travelled extensively in Europe, often to Fiesole, where he had a large circle of friends. He also ventured to India, Australia, and north Africa. Hallam is seen at his best in writing, illustrating, and publishing <span class="italic">The High Road of Empire</span> (1905) and in illustrating H. W. Nevinson's <span class="italic">Sketches on the Old Road through France to Florence</span> (1904).<br>
<br>John [iv] Murray's chief personal service to literature was to edit the six original manuscript versions of the historian Edward Gibbon's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1896). He was a founder of the Publishers' Association, becoming president in 1899, and in that year played a leading part in setting up the net book agreement. The <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1911 was drafted largely at 50 Albemarle Street. Following family tradition, Murray was a staunch Anglican and tory. He was a member of the board of the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children for forty-two years and on the committee of the Athenaeum Club, where it was said that if his boots were left outside his door they would walk on their own to the club and then up the stairs to the billiard room. He was also a member of the Roxburghe Club.<br>
<br>In 1898 Murray published the first of a six-volume edition of Byron's letters and journals, edited by the poet's grandson Lord Lovelace. By this time the Murrays, who had been collecting manuscript material since Byron's death, had come to regard the poet as their own property. Lovelace withdrew from the editorship part way through publication having refused permission to print controversial letters relating to the causes of Byron's marital troubles. The Murrays had a right to publish but continued the series without the contentious correspondence. Lovelace published a defence of his grandmother in a book entitled <span class="italic">Astarte</span> (1905) and the Murrays replied with <span class="italic">Lord Byron and his Detractors</span> (1906).<br>
<br>In 1900 the firm resumed publishing fiction. One of the first titles, Laurence Housman's <span class="italic">An English-woman's Love Letters</span>, became one of the most popular novels of the time, backed by an uncharacteristically aggressive advertising campaign. The <span class="roman">Handbooks for Travellers</span> were sold to Stanfords in 1901 (save for <span class="roman">India</span> and <span class="roman">Japan</span>), the preparation of such guidebooks having become too specialized for a general publisher. Stanfords immediately regretted their bargain but were held to the contract. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, under the editorship of Sir Henry Newbolt, restarted in 1900 and was of good literary quality, but was abandoned in 1907. A more successful venture was the <span class="roman">Wisdom of the East</span> series, which began in 1905, having been initiated the year before by the Orient Press. Edited by Cranmer Byng (both father and son), it ran to 122 booklets at 5<i>s</i>. each and continued until the 1950s.<br>
<br>In the early 1900s the firm was becoming well known as publishers to the establishment, and that reputation was confirmed by the eagerly awaited appearance of the <span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span> (1907&#150;32). Murray was more proud of this title than any other, as no private correspondence of a sovereign had been published in modern times. However, in 1906 <span class="italic">The Times</span> attacked the Murrays for declining to make the first series of the correspondence available cheaply to the Times Book Club (which would have been in breach of the net book agreement). John and Hallam sued, and in May 1908 the jury awarded them a substantial &pound;7500 in damages.<br>
<br>Late in 1908 there was a serious dispute between the brothers, and Hallam resigned from the partnership. The cause was kept secret even in the family, and files for this period were destroyed. The probable cause for the rift was Murray's proposed introduction of his 24-year-old son, John, into a full partnership. Long-standing difficulties with Hallam's wife, Alicia, who believed her husband to be undervalued, exacerbated the situation. An undisclosed financial settlement was reached, and Hallam left the firm, taking with him in addition some Byron manuscripts, literary portraits, and books. Hallam lived for another twenty-six years at Hythe in Kent, friendly but no longer intimate with his brother.<br>
<br>The only significant event of the war years was the daring acquisition for &pound;18,000 of the house of Smith Elder after the death of Reginald Smith in December 1916. There were long-established family and business ties between the Smiths and Murrays. Indeed, the original Smith started his career at Albemarle Street in 1814. Murray knew that the copyrights of Smith's prominent writers would provide the next generation with financial security. It turned out to be an acquisition of singular importance.<br>
<br>In 1919 John [iv] Murray wrote a dutiful but rather dull biography of his father. The sixth and final volume of Byron's <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span> appeared in 1922, and the centenary of the poet's death in 1924 brought Murray both an honorary degree from the University of Athens and the order of the Redeemer (of Greece). His knighthood (KCVO) came in 1926 during the publication of the second series of the <span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>. Murray's last, rather surprising, publishing venture was in progress when he died, <span class="italic">The Story of San Michele</span> (1929) by Axel Munthe, a Murray author since 1887. No one could have foretold that this curious book would sell over a million copies in Britain alone. It was translated into thirty-seven languages and remained in the firm's catalogue for nearly fifty years. On 30 November 1928 Sir John [iv] Murray died at 7 Wilbury Road, Hove, Sussex, of blood poisoning. He was buried at Wargrave, Berkshire, the home of his daughter Dorothy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64909"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Murray</span> <span class="st"> [John [v] Murray]</span>  (1884&#150;1967), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 12 June 1884, the only son of Sir John [iv] Murray and his wife, Katherine Evelyn. Known as Jack, he had two younger sisters. Like his father, he was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a degree in modern history in 1905. In the following year he went on a world tour before entering the family business, becoming a partner in 1909. He was the last editor of the long-established <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the 1914&#150;18 war Murray, then serving as high sheriff of the county of London, joined his regiment, the Scottish horse. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, serving in Egypt, at Gallipoli, and in France. His regiment was subsumed into the Black Watch, but he later transferred to the Royal Scots, and commanded their 12th battalion. In 1918 he was made DSO for personal bravery and awarded a Croix de Guerre (Belgium). On 16 August 1916 he married Lady Helen de Vere (1892&#150;1971), the fifth and youngest daughter of the first Earl Brassey. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Murray, despite relatively little knowledge of the trade, was confirmed in an equal partnership with his father. His abilities were first harnessed to the tasks of integrating the newly acquired Smith Elder business, editing the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, and publishing the third series of the <span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>. Upon the publication of the ninth and final volume of this correspondence in 1932&#151;four years after his father's death&#151;Murray was created KCVO. An administrator by nature, he worked from dawn to dusk, but discovered few if any best-selling authors for the firm during the 1930s and 1940s. Moderate profits were achieved by publishing past successes in cheaper editions, the well established schoolbook list, new books from authors inherited from both his father and Smith Elder, dull memoirs of politicians, military men, and aristocrats, travel books, and works on nineteenth-century history, a field in which Murray had a detailed knowledge.<br>
<br>Murray could write a review at short notice and correct an index with fastidious accuracy. He took pride in knowing the pedigree of every important British family. Like his father, he was a member of the Church of England and a staunch tory, serving for a time on the Westminster city council. He was also a long-standing member of the Roxburghe Club and a life member of the Athenaeum Club. He was a trustee of the Westminster Hospital and treasurer of the Friends of Great Ormond Street Hospital, where there was a John Murray ward. In later years he was chairman of the Deafened Ex-servicemen's Fund and suffered himself from increasing deafness, a handicap &#145;which was so cruelly in conflict with his natural gaity and wit&#146;  (speech of John [vi] Murray at the firm's 200th anniversary dinner in 1968, John Murray archive). Murray would tell anyone he thought verbose to &#145;come back when you have less time&#146;  (private information). Throughout his life he refused to own a car.<br>
<br>Murray's nephew, <a href="#cosubject_64922">John Grey Murray (John [vi]), known as Jock [<i>see below</i>]</a>, entered the firm in 1931. When he returned from service after the war his Uncle Jack is said to have greeted him with the reassuring words: &#145;It's all right, Jock, I haven't taken on any new manuscripts in your absence&#146;  (private information). For nearly thirty years the two very different men directed affairs from Albemarle Street, but it was Jock Murray who brought in the many best-selling books published after the war. There were times when the traditions of the past clashed with the need to modernize. In 1951, with great reluctance, John [v] accepted that it was necessary for the business to change from being a partnership, and it became a limited company.<br>
<br>Sir John [v] Murray died at his home, Flat 5, 49 Lowndes Square, London, on 6 October 1967 after one day's illness. At this time the firm employed about eighty people and published a similar number of books annually.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64922"></a><span class="headword">John Arnaud Robin Grey <span class="st"> [Jock]</span> Murray</span> <span class="st"> [John [vi] Murray]</span>  (1909&#150;1993), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 22 September 1909 at Woodside, Wargrave, Berkshire, the eldest son of Thomas Robinson Grey (1861&#150;1945), a barrister who was later employed in the accounts department at the firm, and Dorothy Evelyn (1881&#150;1958), the daughter of Sir John [iv] Murray. He had an elder sister, Evelyn Marion. By deed poll in 1930 he added &#145;Murray&#146; to his name. In the words of his son, John [vii] Murray: &#145;The Grey line brought to the house flair and a new natural instinct for publishing&#146;.<br>
<br>John [vi] was also educated at Eton College and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where in 1928 he met John Betjeman and Osbert Lancaster, who became lifelong friends as well as his authors. From an early age he was groomed to enter the firm and succeed his uncle. He was fond of recalling a youthful encounter with Conan Doyle on the stairs at Albemarle Street: &#145;If this is an author&#146;, he said to himself, &#145;what fun to be a publisher&#146;  (private information). His boyhood stammer was cured by Lionel Logue, who subsequently helped George VI.<br>
<br>Murray entered the firm in 1931 and became a salaried partner in 1933. It was from Leonard Huxley that he first learned the art of dealing with authors. &#145;A contributor to the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span> told me that he preferred a letter of rejection from Dr. Huxley to one of acceptance from any other editor&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Poet and his Publisher</span>). Jock Murray himself later told an author: &#145;Like a diamond your work will sparkle if cut&#146;  (private information). In the early 1930s he assisted with the editing of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>. After the war the <span class="italic">Cornhill</span> was relaunched by Peter Quennell and continued under Murray's editorship until 1975, when it ceased publication.<br>
<br>Murray married Diana Mary Ramsden James (<i>b</i>. 1911) on 29 March 1939. They had four children, including a son, John Richmond Murray (John [vii]) born in 1941. During the Second World War Murray served for five years in the Royal Artillery, attaining the rank of major. For his role in organizing air transport for Arnhem he was made MBE in 1945. During the war Noel Carrington took Murray's place as a literary adviser.<br>
<br>A group of leading authors was not only published by Murray but also became his closest friends: Freya Stark, Osbert Lancaster, and John Piper were godparents to his children. To Murray a close friendship with his authors was an essential part of publishing and won him loyalty that became the envy of other publishers with the arrival of &#145;chequebook&#146; publishing in the 1970s. The steady flow of popular authors to the Murray list only increased with the publication of John Betjeman's <span class="italic">Continual Dew</span> in 1937, a group collaboration involving Piper and Lancaster, with a jacket by Edward McKnight Kauffer. Thereafter Murray published most of Betjeman's work.<br>
<br>Kenneth Clark's association with the firm began in 1949 with the publication of <span class="italic">Landscape into Art</span>. It continued with <span class="italic">The Nude</span> in 1956, a reprint of <span class="italic">The Gothic Revival</span> six years later, and was capped with Clark's best-selling <span class="italic">Civilisation</span>, published jointly with the BBC to complement the 1969 television series. &#145;Clark's gift for connecting vivid narrative with visual explanation owes much to Jock's ability to fit text and pictures together seamlessly&#146;  (Barker, preface). For Freya Stark, author of <span class="italic">The Valleys of the Assassins</span> and <span class="italic">Baghdad Sketches</span>, Murray would go to extraordinary lengths to supply whatever she needed, wherever she was. One of the more unusual items was a hip-bath sent to Stark in Yemen. Other notable authors published by Murray included C. Northcote Parkinson, Sir Arthur Grimble, Walter Starkie, Iris Origo, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Dervla Murphy, Leslie Marchand, Doris Langley Moore, and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.<br>
<br>The typography, illustration, and production of books from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s gave the firm's imprint a distinctive look that was largely the vision of Jock Murray. Artists such as John Piper and Reynolds Stone were important contributors and advisers. Special editions of publications were often produced, typically bound in half buckram with Cockerell marbled paper.<br>
<br>Less glamorous but of increasing importance during Jock Murray's tenure was the development of the long-standing educational list, which became the financial backbone of the house. D. G. McKean's O-level <span class="italic">Introduction to Biology</span>, with its large format and clarity of illustration, was a landmark in publishing, selling 5 million copies in eight languages. The <span class="roman">Success Studybooks</span> helped satisfy the fast-expanding need for self-teaching texts. Under the direction of Kenneth Pinnock the turnover of the Murray education department increased by over 100 per cent in the 1970s and 1980s, by which time more than half the firm's business was in educational and scientific titles.<br>
<br>Murray himself made an important personal contribution to Byron scholarship. He traced this passion not only to the modernity of the poet's words but to the need to expiate the guilt he felt for his ancestor (John [ii] Murray) burning the poet's memoirs. Initially he assisted Peter Quennell with <span class="italic">Byron: a Self-portrait</span> (1950), and for nearly ten years he collaborated with Leslie Marchand to produce the much-praised edition of Byron's <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span> (1973&#150;94). He also worked closely with Doris Langley Moore, author of <span class="italic">The late Lord Byron</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Lord Byron Accounts Rendered</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">Ada Countess of Lovelace</span> (1977). Such was his obsession for Byron that there was nowhere, however distant, he would not travel in search of an unpublished letter. His Byron knowledge was prodigious, he knew all the great Byron scholars, and had worked closely with many of them including, as a young man in the 1930s, T. J. Wise, the great bibliophile and forger, helping him compile his Ashley Library catalogue.<br>
<br>In 1975 Murray was created CBE for services to literature. He was an engaging raconteur and humorous public speaker. Middling in height, thin, and energetic, with longish hair, he sported a characteristic bow-tie and a colourful set of braces. An expressive pair of raised eyebrows and the signature exclamation &#145;Extraoooordinary&#146; endeared him to friends, authors, and employees alike. He had a genuine gift for friendship, an equable temperament which sometimes belied a darker, depressive side to his nature. For many years Murray kept a commonplace book in which he recorded humorous anecdotes, notable quotations from books, <i>bons mots</i>, proverbs, and the like. <span class="italic">A Gentleman Publisher's Commonplace Book</span> (1996), edited by his son John R. Murray, is a posthumous tribute to a man who reinvigorated a business that could claim to be the oldest independent family-run publishing house in the world. Jock Murray died at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 22 July 1993.<br>
<br>During the course of his career, and particularly towards its end, at a time when the publishing industry was changing dramatically, John [vi] Murray continued to be a strong proponent of the net book agreement, which his ancestor (John [iv] Murray) had played a part in establishing. He served on the councils of the Royal Geographical Society and the Publishers' Association and was a member of the Literary Society, the Society of Dilettanti, and the Roxburghe Club. An accomplished tree surgeon, he once remarked, &#145;Publishers naturally take to forestry because they can cut and chop to their heart's content without authors complaining&#146;  (speech to the Society of Bookmen, 6 Dec 1979). The house of Murray remained in family hands until May 2002 when it was sold to Hodder Headline, who promised to retain the John Murray imprint.<br>
