<span class="headword">Tomes, Sir  John</span>  (1815&#150;1895), <span class="occ">dental surgeon</span>, eldest son of John Tomes (1791&#150;1864), farmer, and his wife, Sarah (1792&#150;1870), daughter of William Baylies of Welford in Gloucestershire, was born at The Sands, Weston-on-Avon, in Gloucestershire, on 21 March 1815. After attending schools in Stratford upon Avon and Evesham, Tomes was articled in 1831 to Thomas Furley Smith, a medical practitioner in Evesham. In 1836 he began medical studies in London at King's College and the Middlesex Hospital, then temporarily united; although unqualified, he was house surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital between 1839 and 1840. He did not take his final examinations but, advised by Sir Thomas Watson (1792&#150;1882) and James Moncrieff Arnott, Tomes decided to become a dental surgeon, and in 1840 he commenced practice at 41 Mortimer Street (later Cavendish Place) in central London. From 1840 to 1843 he was dental surgeon at King's College Hospital and from 1843 to 1874 he practised at the Middlesex Hospital. On 15 February 1844 Tomes married Jane Sibley (1823&#150;1904), daughter of Robert Sibley, architect; of their two sons only the younger survived<a href="#cosubject_56841"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>In 1838, while Tomes was still a student, his first paper was given to the Royal Society. Presented by Thomas Bell, this was on the microscopical structure of teeth and was the earliest detailed histological investigation on the subject to be published by an English author. For twenty years Tomes continued to study the histology of bone and dental tissues; several anatomical structures are named after him. He published widely in medical, dental, and scientific journals, and on 6 June 1850 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, where his most important papers were presented. Tomes also developed the more modern type of forceps adapted to the necks of individual teeth, and in 1845 patented the &#145;dentifactor&#146; for carving ivory to fit irregular surfaces and to facilitate the making of dentures, for which he received the Isis gold medal of the Society of Arts. He introduced a number of technical innovations, devised new instruments, and made other improvements in operative dental surgery. In 1845 he delivered a course of lectures at the Middlesex Hospital which marked a new era in dentistry. These were published in 1848, and his <span class="italic">System of Dental Surgery</span> in 1859. This remained a standard work for fifty years. It reached a fifth edition in 1906 and was also published in France and America. When ether became available in 1847 he administered it for dental extractions and acted as anaesthetist for surgical operations at the Middlesex Hospital.<br>
<br>Entry to the dental profession was, in the mid-nineteenth century, haphazard, with no specific qualification available. After two unsuccessful attempts in 1843 and 1855, Tomes was one of several practitioners who, with the support of Arnott, persuaded the Royal College of Surgeons in 1858 to institute a licence in dental surgery (LDS). Having first belatedly qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, Tomes was appointed one of the first examiners. The establishment of a qualification ensuring fitness to practise gave encouragement to those who wished for statutory organization of dental practice, and eventually, after years of discussion, the Dental Reform Committee was set up in 1875. With others, notably James Smith Turner, Tomes, as chairman of the committee, pressed the government to enforce stricter regulation of dental practice, and the <span class="roman">Dentists' Act</span> of 1878 established a dentists' register under the control of the General Medical Council. The success of the Dental Reform Committee, which had proved the value of co-operation between dentists, led to the formation of the British Dental Association in 1880. Tomes was its first president. He was also a founder member of the Odontological Society and president in 1862 and 1875.<br>
<br>In 1876 Tomes retired to Upwood Gorse, Caterham, Surrey. He was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883, and was knighted in 1886. On his golden wedding anniversary he was presented by his fellow dentists with an inkstand and a sum of money which endowed a prize bearing his name to be awarded triennially by the Royal College of Surgeons for researches in the field of dental science. Tomes died on 29 July 1895 at his home, Upwood Gorse, and was buried at St Mary's, Upper Caterham, on 1 August.<br>
<br>Tomes began to practise dentistry when it was a trade; he left it a well-equipped profession. He showed that a dentist was capable of the highest kind of scientific work&#151;that of original observation. In addition he had considerable technical skills and a practical mind.<br>
<br>Tomes's younger son, <a name="cosubject_56841"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles Sissmore Tomes</span>  (1846&#150;1928), <span class="occ">dental surgeon</span>, was born in London on 6 June 1846. Educated at Radley College and Christ Church, Oxford, he gained the only first-class honours in natural sciences in 1866. He then studied at King's College and the Middlesex Hospital, London, and qualified LDS and MRCS in 1869. He then joined his father's practice. On 12 November 1873 he married Elizabeth (Lizzie) Eno Cook (<i>d</i>. 1935) of New York, and a daughter was born in 1876. Tomes lectured at the Dental Hospital, Leicester Square, and for fourteen years was an examiner for the LDS. He published many papers on histology and comparative dental anatomy, and his collection of specimens enriched the Odontological Society museum, where he was curator from 1874 to 1880. He also compiled its first catalogue. He was president of the Odontological Society in 1887 and of the British Dental Association in 1894. His <span class="italic">Manual of Dental Anatomy, Human and Comparative</span> (1876) achieved eight editions. He edited and enlarged the second and subsequent editions of John Tomes's <span class="italic">System of Dental Surgery</span>. In 1878 Charles Tomes became a fellow of the Royal Society. From 1899 to 1920 he was crown nominee to the General Medical Council, and he was also its treasurer and chairman of its dental committee. In 1898 he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1909 he received an honorary LLD from the University of Birmingham; in 1919 he received a knighthood. Under the name of Charles Sissmore he painted in oils and watercolours, at least once exhibiting at the Royal Academy. He died on 24 October 1928 at his home, Mannington Hall, Aylsham, Norfolk, bequeathing &pound;2000 to the Royal College of Surgeons, which endowed two annual eponymous lectures.<br>
