<span class="headword">Heller,  Thomas Edmund</span>  (1837&#150;1901), <span class="occ">teachers' union leader</span>, was born on 15 May 1837 at Bishopsteignton, Devon. He was the son of Edmund Heller, a schoolmaster, who later moved to Cheam, Surrey. Heller attended the Cheam Schools as a pupil and then a pupil teacher, subsequently winning a queen's scholarship to the Cheltenham Training College, where he trained as a teacher from 1857 to 1858. He was then appointed master of the college's model school, and in 1862 became headmaster of the National Schools, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth. He rapidly became active in various Church of England teachers' associations, and was at the founding meeting of the National Union of Elementary Teachers (NUET) in 1870. In 1873 he became the second general secretary of the union, known from 1889 as the National Union of Teachers (NUT), and the first paid secretary. He served until 1891, when he became seriously ill and retired. In 1895, St Andrews University awarded him an LLD for services to education.<br>
<br>During Heller's period as general secretary the union's membership rose from under 7000 to over 18,000, and its finances became much more sound. He fought hard for a teachers' pension scheme, finally established soon after he retired, and campaigned against payment by results, the great <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of teachers of his period. For a long time progress on the latter was limited by the unco-operative attitude of the education department; the rapid decline of the system after 1890 was the result of pressure from a variety of groups, of which the NUT was one. Within the union, Heller seems to have been a moderate, opposing excessively militant demands which were likely to alienate the church school teachers, while pursuing a reasonably vigorous policy of attempting to ameliorate grievances. He was also a member of the London school board from 1874 to 1888 and of the royal commission on education (the Cross commission) between 1886 and 1888. On this latter he supported educational liberalization and opposed rate aid for voluntary schools.<br>
<br>Heller's career spans the transition from a largely church-dominated system of education to a much more secular one. He went to an Anglican evangelical training college, and was aligned with the church teachers' wing of the NUET in its early years. Subsequently his liberalism and his support for school boards seems to have caused some disaffection among church school teachers. He was also representative of the strong presence in the union of college-trained teachers: on the Cross commission, he supported the extension of college training and restrictions on untrained teachers. He symbolizes much that was characteristic of the NUET: church-influenced but also increasingly receptive to the pressures of secularization; educationally liberal but also concerned, in classic trade-union fashion, to limit entry to the teaching profession.<br>
<br>Heller was married twice: in his early twenties to Margaret Jane White (<i>d</i>. 1874); and in 1877 to Lydia C. Lee, a former headmistress, who also predeceased him. He had a daughter, who became a training-college tutor, and two sons, one a solicitor and the other an educational administrator. He was an enthusiastic musician and encourager of music in schools, and a freemason. He died on 17 February 1901 at his home, 51 Southside, Clapham Common, London, and was buried at Brompton cemetery, where also had been buried both his wives.<br>
