<span class="headword">Dibdin,  Charles Isaac Mungo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Charles Isaac Pitt; <em>performing name </em>Charles Dibdin the younger]</span>  (1768&#150;1833), <span class="occ">theatre manager and writer</span>, was born on 27 October 1768 in Russell Court, near Drury Lane, London, the eldest son of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7585/', "Charles Dibdin (bap. 1745, d. 1814)")</script> and the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22329/', "Harriet Pitt (1748?&#150;1814)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22326/', "Pitt, Ann")</script>]. He was named after his father, his father's writing partner Isaac Bickerstaff, and their famous character Mungo from <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> (1767), which the elder Dibdin had played to great acclaim, although this last name seems to have been dropped in childhood. He made his theatrical d&eacute;but with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7589/', "Thomas John Dibdin")</script> walking in the procession for the revival of Garrick's <span class="italic">The Jubilee</span> in 1775. By this time his parents had separated, and young Charles and his mother were known by their mother's surname of Pitt. His mother entrusted her sons to her uncle Cecil Pitt, a household goods broker in the City of London. Charles first attended a school in Hackney, but at the age of nine was sent to a harsh boarding-school at Barnard Castle, co. Durham, where he remained for five years without a holiday. He was joined there after a few years by Thomas.<br>
<br>When he was fourteen Charles Pitt returned to London, where he was apprenticed to a pawnbroker, Mr Cordy, of Snow Hill; after the end of his seven years' apprenticeship he remained there as a shopman. Pitt's tastes were for literature rather than pawnbroking, and in 1792 he published a collection of verse, <span class="italic">Poetical Attempts: by a Young Man</span>, which was followed by other works. In 1797, with Cordy's support, he left the shop and made his d&eacute;but as an entertainer at the Royalty Theatre in a one-man show called <span class="italic">Sans six sous</span>, a pun on his poverty and the name of his estranged father's theatre, the Sans Souci. From then on he was known professionally as Charles Dibdin the younger, although when he married an actress, Mary Bates (1781/2&#150;1816), at St George's, Hanover Square, on 13 June 1797, he was entered in the register as Charles Isaac Pitt. The couple had eleven children, nine of whom reached adulthood, including Mary Anne (1799&#150;1886), a harpist, who became the second wife of the controversialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27538/', "Lewis Hippolytus Joseph Tonna")</script>; Robert William (1805&#150;1887), a clergyman, who was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32810/', "Sir Lewis Tonna Dibdin (1852&#150;1938)")</script>; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7587/', "Henry Edward Dibdin (1813&#150;1866)")</script>. Following his marriage Dibdin successfully sold a pantomime to Philip Astley at the Amphitheatre of the Arts, who contracted Dibdin and his wife for a three-year engagement. They toured with the Astley company to Dublin and Liverpool as well as performing in London. For Astley Dibdin wrote a succession of songs, prologues, epilogues, and one-act musical plays, and in the 1798&#150;9 season he was Astley's assistant manager in Dublin. The dismissal of his wife for sewing during rehearsals may have encouraged him to look for other employment, and in autumn 1799 he and his wife joined a touring equestrian company, managed by William Davis and others, visiting Liverpool, Bristol, and Manchester. Ridicule from the audience at Manchester following his inability to perform a song he had composed two hours before led Dibdin to renounce appearing on stage.<br>
<br>Dibdin's existence became less precarious when, in 1800, he successfully applied for the post of manager at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London. His choice of performers, who included (he claimed) the young Edmund Kean among the singers, tightrope-walkers, and pugilists, and seasons that introduced new works by himself and others that met the public taste for spectacle and patriotic sentiment, improved the fortunes of Sadler's Wells. In 1802 he and his brother Thomas became shareholders in the theatre. In 1804 Dibdin installed a water tank that enabled him to advertise Sadler's Wells as an aquatic theatre &#145;with realistic naval battles and Newfoundland dogs rescuing drowning children&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). According to his doorkeeper, Dibdin's reluctance to spend money meant that the tank was refilled with fresh water only every two months. It was also alleged that he would not provide his performers with a green room, and that his wife's jealousy prevented any woman singer who received an encore for a particular song performing that song again.<br>
<br>Dibdin's management survived the disaster of 15 October 1807, when eighteen people were killed in a stampede to escape a non-existent fire in the theatre. However, the end of the Napoleonic wars also reduced the public's appetite for Dibdin's brand of entertainment. His wife, to whom he expressed devotion&#151;&#145;during the nineteen years we were united she never contravened my wishes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 118)&#151;died on 16 August 1816. In 1819 he was confined for debt within the rules of the king's bench. In 1821 he sold his shares in Sadler's Wells, and this may have enabled his release at about this time. He continued to write songs and pantomimes, and was stage director for his former colleague William Davis at the Royal Amphitheatre from 1822 to 1823 and manager of the Surrey Theatre from 1825 to 1826. He also continued to publish poetry, including <span class="italic">Young Arthur, or, The Child of Mystery: a Metrical Romance</span> (1819). His <span class="italic">A History of the London Theatres</span> was published in 1826. His last farce, <span class="italic">Nothing Superfluous</span>, was produced at Hull in 1829. In 1830 he completed his memoirs, but they were not published until an abridged version appeared in 1956. He died on 13 January 1833 and may have been buried at St James's Chapel, Pentonville; his last collection of verse, <span class="italic">The Physiological Mentor, or, Lessons from Nature</span>, intended as a teaching aid for children, was published after his death. The manuscript of an unfinished novel, <span class="italic">Mattias Meddler</span>, is in the British Library; Southampton Central Library has manuscripts of Dibdin's musical scores. Dibdin's work was never as original as that of his father, and he never enjoyed an association with the major theatres as his brother did, but his reign at Sadler's Wells was for the most part tremendously popular. He was unquestionably an indefatigable showman, deeply obsessed with and devoted to the stage.<br>
