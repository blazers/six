<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morley,  Robert Adolph Wilton</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 26 May 1908 in Semley, Wiltshire, the son of Major Robert Wilton Morley, retired, of the 4th dragoon guards and his wife, Gertrude Emily Fass. He was educated at several preparatory schools&#151;his parents' lives being somewhat itinerant&#151;and at Wellington College (1921&#150;4), which he detested. He was by nature an individualist, unathletic, and opposed to formal teaching. At Folkestone, aged thirteen, he saw Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> and was immediately determined to be an actor: his love of Shaw and hatred of public schools probably activated his lifelong socialism.<br>
<br>After leaving Wellington and studying in Germany, France, and Italy, his father favouring a diplomatic career, Morley chose to study for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His first professional theatre engagement was at the Hippodrome, Margate, on 28 May 1928 after which he spent several years touring and in repertory theatres. Working with the fading and forgetful Shakespearian actor Frank Benson, Morley learned some invaluable lessons: how to improvise, how not to believe in the sanctity of any text, the joy of being surrounded by eccentrics  (S. Morley, 38). With another humorous heavyweight, Peter Bull, he essayed repertory at Perranporth, Cornwall. After almost deciding to give up the stage he was chosen to play Oscar Wilde at the Gate Theatre in London (September 1936). He made a considerable success in the role, displaying both wit and pathos.<br>
<br>He had another flamboyant role as Alexandre Dumas in <span class="italic">The Great Romancer</span> (May 1937) and was soon established as a leading actor, repeating his success as Oscar Wilde in New York (October 1938). On 23 February 1940 he married Joan North Buckmaster (1910&#150;2005), the eldest child of the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30964/', "Dame Gladys Cooper")</script> and her first husband, Herbert John Buckmaster; they had two sons and a daughter. As the outrageous Sheridan Whiteside in <span class="italic">The Man who Came to Dinner</span> (Savoy, 1941) he had a tremendous success; the play ran in London and on tour until 1943. In July 1945 he played the prince regent in <span class="italic">The First Gentleman</span>, which ran for over a year. After this came his greatest all-round success <span class="italic">Edward, my Son</span> (1947) which he co-wrote with Noel Langley&#151;starring as a ruthless but amusing media mogul: it subsequently played in New York, Australia, and New Zealand (1948&#150;1950).<br>
<br>Morley then discovered a new comic writer suited to his talents: the Frenchman Andr&eacute; Roussin, whose <span class="italic">The Little Hut</span> (1950), adapted by Nancy Mitford, achieved another long run. In 1954 Morley himself adapted and starred in Roussin's <span class="italic">Hippo Dancing</span> and in 1958 he repeated the formula with <span class="italic">Hook, Line and Sinker</span>. Before this last he had appeared in the musical <span class="italic">Fanny</span> (1956). Although unable to sing or dance he gave a performance of rare emotional depth. Later successes included Peter Ustinov's <span class="italic">Halfway up the Tree</span> (1967), considerably rewritten by Morley, and <span class="italic">How the Other Half Loves</span> (1970) by the young Alan Ayckbourn. The new school of playwright was not used to <i>monstres sacr&eacute;s</i> with a cavalier attitude to the text, and when he told Ayckbourn &#145;I've left a trail of richer but sadder authors behind me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 June 1992), he was right on both counts. <span class="italic">A Ghost on Tiptoe</span> (1974) did well enough but by then boulevard comedy was on its way out. Morley, despite his progressive views, was uneasy with contemporary drama and, when asked by Peter Hall to play Falstaff, declined, never having enjoyed Shakespeare. Life continued with some brilliant journalism, solo performances, and lucrative commercials: at length he found two more plays to match his talents. The first was <span class="italic">Banana Ridge</span> (Savoy, 1976), an uproarious Ben Travers revival, the second Alan Bennett's <span class="italic">The Old Country</span> (Australian tour, 1980). Morley played a Philbyesque spy in exile; his son, the critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98604/', "Sheridan Morley (1941&#150;2007)")</script>, extolled &#145;a truly breathtaking performance&#146; in this his father's last stage appearance  (S. Morley, 208).<br>
<br>Morley's film career was prolific almost to the end. Following his first New York appearance he went to Hollywood to play Louis XVI in <span class="italic">Marie Antoinette</span> (1938). Back in England he was an outstanding Undershaft in <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> (1941). Always the lead in stage plays, in films he was content to play supporting parts, enlivening scores of routine pictures by his zestful personality. Among his best screen roles were the gross Almayer in <span class="italic">Outcast of the Islands</span> (1951), Katharine Hepburn's brother in <span class="italic">The African Queen</span> (1952), Gilbert in <span class="italic">Gilbert and Sullivan</span> (1953), a comically evil mobster in <span class="italic">Beat the Devil</span> (1953), a heart-rending if over-mature reprise of <span class="italic">Oscar Wilde</span> (1960), a gentleman crook in <span class="italic">Topkapi</span> (1965), and a fastidious critic in <span class="italic">Theatre of Blood</span> (1973).<br>
<br>Morley's own plays included <span class="italic">Short Story</span> (1935) starring Marie Tempest, <span class="italic">Goodness how Sad</span> (1937), written for the Perranporth company, and the domestic tragedy <span class="italic">Edward, my Son</span>. None of them has been revived&#151;nor indeed have many of the plays in which he starred and which he cheerfully rewrote. The lack of his own presence in them leaves a void hard to fill.<br>
<br>Robert Morley was unique. &#145;Your father always seemed to be having so much fun in the theatre&#146; said a slightly puzzled Peggy Ashcroft  (S. Morley, 86). That sentence encapsulates the secret of his success. Although his outsize form and features&#151;equally adept at expressing pompous petulance, astonishment, and hearty <i>joie de vivre</i>&#151;are happily preserved on film, his true place was on the stage creating enormous fun for himself and his audiences: a heavyweight with a charmingly light voice and the lightest of comic touches. Like a hotelier, each night he catered for a different clientele. To suit it he would unabashedly readjust his performance, sometimes disconcerting his fellow players but never short-changing his public. On stage and off, the perfect entertainer, he was the last light comedian in the Edwardian Hawtrey and Du Maurier tradition. For all his television &#145;personality&#146; chat-show appearances he was, like his predecessors, a thoroughly accomplished actor.<br>
<br>In 1957 Morley was appointed CBE. In 1966 he wrote (with Sewell Stokes) <span class="italic">Robert Morley, Responsible Gentleman</span>, and he subsequently brought out a number of journalistic anthologies. For a time he was in management with Robin Fox. Morley's was a happy life: he was an enthusiastic gourmet, traveller, and gambler whose faults&#151;childlike egotism and obstinacy&#151;were far outweighed by his virtues: huge generosity, love of life, devotion to family and friends. He died, following a stroke, at Dunedin Hospital, Bath Road, Reading, on 3 June 1992: many of his friends commented that he would have been annoyed to have missed the Derby, which was run later that day.<br>
