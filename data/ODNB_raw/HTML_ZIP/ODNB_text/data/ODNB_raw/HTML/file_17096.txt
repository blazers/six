<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowin,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1576, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of Richard Lowin of London, was baptized on 9 December 1576 at St Giles Cripplegate. His father was a currier, or tanner of leather (not a carpenter, as early authorities state), and must have been a fairly well-to-do craftsman, for he apprenticed his son to a goldsmith: this was a desirable trade that could be entered only by boys whose fathers owned property. Lowin was bound to Nicholas Rudyard for eight years from Christmas 1593, and although he is not recorded achieving freedom of the trade, he probably completed his apprenticeship since notices of him as an actor begin only in 1602. Additional testimony comes from the City pageant by Anthony Munday (or Mundy) entitled <span class="italic">Chruso-thriambos, or, The Triumphs of Gold</span> (October 1611), in which Lowin played the goldsmith Leofstane, supposedly the first mayor of London. This spectacular parade was mounted by the Goldsmiths' Company to celebrate the election of a goldsmith, Sir James Pemberton, as lord mayor, and a company document recording Lowin's agreement to perform calls him &#145;one of his Majesty's players and brother of this company&#146;  (Gordon and Robertson, 81). We can only speculate how he had migrated from Cheapside to the Bankside, but he was not the only goldsmith's apprentice to follow this route: the comedian Robert Armin, Lowin's colleague in the King's Men, was another prominent example.<br>
<br>Lowin first appears as a player in the records of the Earl of Worcester's Men, during their time at the Rose playhouse in Southwark. Until recently a provincial company, Worcester's became established in London in 1601 after the appointment of their patron as Elizabeth's master of horse; in the next reign they acquired Queen Anne's patronage. Lowin appears in the books of the Rose's impresario, Philip Henslowe, during the winter of 1602&#150;3, usually through business concerning the purchase of new plays. In March 1603 Henslowe lent him 5<i>s</i>. &#145;when he went into the country with the company to play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henslowe's Diary</span>, 212). But later that year he moved into London's premier troupe, the King's Men. The playhouses were closed for twelve months from March 1603 because of Elizabeth's death and the plague, during which period the companies were reallocated to new royal patrons. Lowin does not appear in the official company lists of May 1603 or March 1604, but in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1616) he is listed seventh among the performers of <span class="italic">Sejanus</span>, which play, it is believed, the King's Men premi&egrave;red at court late in 1603. He remained with the King's Men until the end of his career, by which time he was their longest-serving player.<br>
<br>Lowin had a high company profile from the first, since he was one of five actors featured in the induction added in 1604 by John Webster to John Marston's <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> for its performances at the Globe. Webster's amusing scene stages a &#145;real-life&#146; conversation between audience and performers before the play begins. Two troublesome spectators (played by actors) try to sit on the stage as was the practice at the Blackfriars Theatre, and have to be persuaded to enter the boxes by three cast members, Richard Burbage, Henry Condell, and Lowin. As the most junior, Lowin's part is small, but it testifies to his standing with the company that he was singled out. Over the next forty years he played important roles in some of the best-known dramas of the time, including the Shakespeare, Jonson, Fletcher, and Massinger plays that formed the core of the King's Men's repertoire. He stands eleventh among the actors listed in the Shakespeare first folio (1623), and heads the signatories of the dedication to the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio.<br>
<br>Lowin was an imposing individual. His portrait in the Ashmolean Museum, painted when he was sixty-four, depicts him as bulky but dignified, possessed of both power and grace. These qualities are reflected in his roles. In the 1690s James Wright recollected seeing him as Falstaff (&#145;with mighty applause&#146;), as the bluff soldier Melantius in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Maid's Tragedy</span>, and in several Jonsonian parts: the title role in <span class="italic">Volpone</span>, the misanthrope Morose in <span class="italic">Epicene</span>, and the sensualist Epicure Mammon in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>  (Bentley, 2.505). Wright would have witnessed Lowin in the 1630s, so these were not all parts he had created; Volpone was one of Burbage's roles, and <span class="italic">Epicene</span> was originally a boys' play. Lowin also took over Belleur, a gentleman &#145;of a stout blunt humour&#146;, in revivals of Fletcher's spirited comedy <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chase</span>. Of the roles he himself created, he had leading parts in some two dozen plays by Fletcher, but his greatest was the self-doubting criminal Bosola in Webster's <span class="italic">Duchess of Malfi</span> (1613). He also played Massinger's despotic Romans Domitian in <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> (1626) and Flaminius in <span class="italic">Believe as you List</span> (1631), the wealthy citizen Undermine in John Clavell's <span class="italic">The Soddered Citizen</span> (1630), and the title character, &#145;of great beard and bulk&#146;, in Arthur Wilson's <span class="italic">The Swisser</span> (1631). A late tradition recorded by John Downes has him as Shakespeare's original Henry VIII (1611): Downes says he passed his interpretation to Sir William Davenant, having &#145;had his instructions from Mr Shakespeare himself&#146;  (Bentley, 2.502, 506). Evidently Lowin excelled in commanding and authoritative roles, but had considerable range in both tragedy and comedy. In the Caroline period he and Joseph Taylor, Burbage's successor as principal tragedian, were the King's Men's most senior actors and typically appeared in tandem, Taylor playing Mosca to Lowin's Volpone, Arbaces to his Melantius, Paris to his Domitian, and Ferdinand to his Bosola.<br>
<br>In the prologue to Davenant's <span class="italic">The Platonic Lovers</span> (1635), Lowin reminded his audience that he had:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">laboured here<br>
</div>
<div>In buskins and in socks this thirty year<br>
</div> (Bentley, 2.503)</blockquote>His labours, though, were increasingly consumed by company administration. He became a company shareholder in the reorganization of 1627, with two out of seventeen shares, making him one of the six people with a controlling financial stake in the troupe. Then in 1630, after the death of John Heminges, Lowin and Taylor became the company's business representatives. For the next twelve years they acted as its day-to-day agents, and took over the responsibility for liaison between the King's Men and the authorities at court, an onerous and important job. Lowin's status with the company had already helped him to achieve a small court office, since at some point before the end of James's reign he acquired the post of porter, for which he paid &pound;200. He also acquired a family. It is unclear whether he was the John Lowin who married Joan Hall, a widow, at St Botolph without Bishopgate in 1607, but in 1620 he certainly married Katherine Wooden at St Saviour's, Southwark, the parish he resided in for most of his working life. A son, John, was baptized there in 1639. By this time Lowin was sixty-two; the 1640 portrait depicts a man conscious of his prosperity and achievements.<br>
<br>Lowin's career was abruptly interrupted in September 1642, when the theatres were closed by order of parliament, not to reopen officially in his lifetime. The activities of his final decade can only be tentatively reconstructed. The next five years are a blank, though he had capital to fall back on, since the King's Men sharers liquidated their stock when the theatres closed. Although the company was effectively dissolved, its network held together, for the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher folio was published with a dedicatory letter from the actors, and in 1652 Fletcher's <span class="italic">Wild Goose Chase</span> was separately published with a preface by Lowin and Taylor. And even though playing was banned, some surreptitious performances by unlicensed troupes continued, the peak period coming in 1648. In January of that year seven former King's Men, headed by Lowin, contracted to pay a debt due to the widow of an eighth, and it was possibly this group that illegally staged the King's Men's play <span class="italic">Wit without Money</span> at the Red Bull in February. James Wright claimed that a troupe led by Lowin and Taylor were covertly performing at the Drury Lane Cockpit late in 1648, and that one afternoon, while playing Fletcher and Massinger's <span class="italic">The Bloody Brother</span>, they were arrested by soldiers, briefly imprisoned, and lost their costumes. Wright's notes date from 1699, so their details may not be reliable, but other sources show that at least three unlicensed companies had resurfaced, and were suppressed in similar circumstances as security measures before the king's execution. This arrest seems to have ended Lowin's acting career, and subsequent financial problems are signalled by the 1652 edition of Fletcher's <span class="italic">Wild Goose Chase</span>, which was printed to raise money for Lowin and Taylor. Wright says Lowin ended his days as innkeeper of the Three Pigeons at Brentford, &#145;and his poverty was as great as his age&#146;  (Bentley, 2.505). He was buried at St Clement Danes on 24 August 1653.<br>
<br>The only serious puzzle around Lowin relates to the tract <span class="italic">Conclusions upon Dances</span> (1607). This decidedly pious treatise, that censures most kinds of dancing on the grounds of profanity, was published with an epistle signed &#145;I. L., Roscio&#146;&#151;that is &#145;player&#146;, after the Roman actor Roscius. Lowin is the only Jacobean player whose initials fit, and the attribution, originally made by John Payne Collier, has been generally accepted. It is not impossible to reconcile the pamphlet's opinions with the outlook of an actor who came from citizen stock, and who achieved such heights of social respectability. Yet if Lowin really was the author, his theology was so much in tension with his calling that it must have made his professional life a never-ending source of scruple.<br>
