<span class="headword">St Maur <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Seymour]</span>,  Edward Adolphus</span>, twelfth duke of Somerset  (1804&#150;1885), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born in London on 20 December 1804. He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25163/', "Edward Adolphus Seymour, eleventh duke of Somerset (1775&#150;1855)")</script>, and his first wife, Charlotte, daughter of the duke of Hamilton, and was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 11 October 1823, but leaving the university without a degree. He then travelled abroad, visiting Russia among other countries. He married, on 10 June 1830, Jane Georgiana, the youngest of the three daughters of Thomas Sheridan (son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "R. B. Sheridan")</script>) and his wife, Caroline Henrietta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Callender. Lord Seymour, as he was commonly called, fought a duel in 1835 with Sir Colquhoun Grant, who challenged him because he would not deny having been privy to the elopement of Sir Colquhoun's only daughter and heir with Lady Seymour's brother, also called R. B. Sheridan. After shots had been exchanged without injury to either combatant, Seymour stated his ignorance of the transaction. His wife had helped her brother to obtain the hand of the heiress, and she did so without informing her husband. In August 1839 Lady Seymour presided as &#145;Queen of Beauty&#146; over the tournament at Eglinton Castle. She had &#145;large deep blue or violet eyes, black hair, perfect features, and a complexion of lilies and roses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Songs, Poems and verses</span>).<br>
<br>Seymour entered the Commons as MP for Okehampton in 1830, and from 1834 to 1855 was MP for Totnes, sitting as a whig. In 1835 he was appointed a lord of the Treasury in Melbourne's administration. In 1839 he was promoted to be secretary to the Board of Control, and in 1840 he carried through the house a bill, which received the royal assent, for establishing a board of superintendence for railways. He was under-secretary for the Home department for two months in 1841. He voted for the repeal of the corn laws. Lord John Russell appointed him first commissioner of works in 1851, with a seat in the cabinet, but he was out of office for several years following Russell's resignation in 1852. During the campaign in the Crimea he served on the committee to inquire into the state of the army. He relinquished his seat at Totnes in August 1855 when he succeeded to his father's peerage and took his seat in the House of Lords, as duke of Somerset. In Palmerston's government of 1859, Somerset was appointed first lord of the Admiralty. Although not personally popular, Somerset was an efficient administrator, and initially had some success, backed by Palmerston, in maintaining spending on the navy. He played an important part in the development of a programme of construction of iron clad ships, and from 1859 until 1862 he had public support. The rise of the economy movement in the Liberal Party led, however, to much criticism of the Admiralty as both expensive and inefficient, and from 1863 spending on the navy began to decline. After leaving office in 1866, Somerset defended his record anonymously in <span class="italic">The Naval Expenditure from 1860 to 1866, and its Results</span> (1866). He was created a knight of the Garter on 21 May 1862, and Earl St Maur of Berry Pomeroy on 17 June 1863, at which time he took the surname St Maur. He declined to join Gladstone's 1868 government; by 1872 Lord Granville thought him &#145;leader of a very formidable cave in the Lords&#146;. He criticized government policy on the ballot and the <i>Alabama</i> affair, but voted for Irish disestablishment, and the abolition of army purchase.<br>
<br>Somerset's two sons died early, in 1865 and 1869, blighting his later life. Gladstone considered offering him the Indian governor-generalship but thought &#145;the recollection of his son's death might be an impediment&#146; (though he also thought Somerset in 1872 &#145;wonderfully strong and wiry&#146;). In his grief Somerset worked on historical Christianity, and turned to theism, publishing <span class="italic">Christian Theology and Modern Scepticism</span> (1872). His wife died on 14 December 1884; he died on 28 November 1885 at Stover Lodge, near Newton Abbot, and was buried at Gerrards Cross. The dukedom devolved to the twelfth duke's younger brother, Archibald Henry Algernon (1810&#150;1891). Somerset's first child, <a name="cosubject_49739"></a><span class="headword">Edward Adolphus Ferdinand St Maur <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Seymour]</span></span>  (1835&#150;1869), was born on 17 July 1835 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 19 May 1853. Styled Lord Seymour and, from 1863, Earl St Maur, he attended the coronation of Alexander II as Lord Granville's attach&eacute;, and fought in Persia with Sir James Outram, and with Sir Colin Campbell in India in 1857. As &#145;Captain Sarsfield&#146; he took part in Garibaldi's campaign in Sicily in 1860. He and Rosina Elizabeth Swan of Higham, a Gypsy and the daughter of a bricklayer, had two illegitimate children, Richard Harold (<i>b</i>. 1869) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63832/', "Ruth Mary Cavendish-Bentinck")</script>, the suffragist. St Maur died, unmarried, in Dover Street, London, on 30 September 1869. In 1872 Rosina married Fran&ccedil;ois Tournier of Bordeaux, but died shortly afterwards of consumption.<br>
