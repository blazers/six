<span class="headword">Kennedy,  James</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1662&#150;1686), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was the son of James Kennedy, town clerk of Aberdeen and sheriff clerk from 1661 to 1672, who was dismissed from his post when writs were issued against him for debts he had incurred. Both father and son possessed the title of sheriff clerk when they were admitted burgesses of Aberdeen on 9 June 1668. The son may be identical with the James Kennedy who became conservator of Scottish privileges and Scottish resident in the Low Countries about 1684, and who was knighted in that or the following year. After the departure of Bevil Skelton, Kennedy was also appointed English resident and belatedly received his commission as consul from the states general of the United Provinces at Rotterdam on 16 August 1686, but his time in the town was marred by the antagonism of the English community there. His office brought him great personal expense and he wrote letters to Skelton and Lord Middleton describing the straitened circumstances of his large family, which included his five children (see BL, Add. MS 41820, fols. 28, 35).<br>
<br>Kennedy's first publication, a pastoral with echoes of Virgil's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span>, emerged in Aberdeen in 1662 entitled <span class="italic"><i>Diad&#275;ma kai mitra</i>, seu, Daphnidis et Druydum reditus</span> (&#145;The Diadem and the Mitre, or, The Return of Daphnis and the Druids&#146;). The poem, which comprises eighty Latin hexameters, takes the form of a conversation between two shepherds, describing the celebrations in Scotland now that Daphnis and the druids have returned from exile. It is a simple allegory on the return of the episcopacy to Scotland: Daphnis represents James Sharp, archbishop of St Andrews, and the druids are the bishops. In the same year Kennedy found in the marriage of Charles II and Catherine of Braganza another reason to rejoice, and published <span class="italic"><i>Gam&#275;lion d&#333;ron</i></span> (&#145;Wedding present&#146;), a jubilant epithalamium in Latin hexameters. The little volume is rounded off with a prayer in Latin sapphics for the safety of the royal couple and their kingdom.<br>
<br>Kennedy's only other published work was <span class="italic">Aeneas Britannicus</span> (1663), a poem largely composed of passages culled from the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> and pieced together to celebrate Charles II as the &#145;British Aeneas&#146;. The unique copy of this book, of which only the first few pages (containing 211 hexameters) survive, is in Aberdeen University Library. A couple of lines from the poem, which mimic the beginning of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, will indicate the style:<blockquote>
<div>Arma virumque cano, Britannis primus ab oris<br>
</div>
<div>Gallica qui fato profugus Germanaque venit<br>
</div>
<div>Littora.<br>
</div>(Arms I sing and the man, who first left British shores, exiled by fate, and came to the coasts of France and Germany. Ll. 5&#150;7)</blockquote>What remains of the poem covers only the battle of Worcester, but the &#145;argument&#146; attests that it went on to describe Charles's exile, restoration, and marriage, hinting that this was a sizeable production. Although he has been described as a straggler behind the great tradition of Scottish Latin verse  (Bradner, 198), James Kennedy was a competent Latin poet, and his letters show him to have been conscientious in his duties as a consul.<br>
