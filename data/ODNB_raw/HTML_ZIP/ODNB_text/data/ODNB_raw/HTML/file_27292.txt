<span class="headword">Thomson,  Andrew Mitchell</span>  (1779&#150;1831), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and journalist</span>, was born on 11 July 1779 in the manse at Sanquhar, Dumfriesshire, the third of four children of John Thomson (1741&#150;1822), Church of Scotland minister, and his first wife, Helen Forrest (<i>d</i>. 1801). His father, a devout evangelical, was translated to Markinch, Fife, in 1785 and to New Greyfriars, Edinburgh, in 1800. Thomson was educated at the Markinch parish school (from 1785), and at the University of Edinburgh (1796&#150;9, and later, 1810&#150;11, to complete the MA). He was licensed to preach in the Church of Scotland by the presbytery of Kelso on 7 October 1800, served briefly as a private tutor and school teacher, and was ordained to the ministry of the rural parish of Sprouston, in Roxburghshire, on 11 March 1802. In that year, on 26 April, he married Jane Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1840), of Greenock; they had ten children (seven of whom survived Thomson). Their eldest son was the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27315/', "John Thomson")</script>. In 1808, Thomson was translated to the East Church, Perth; two years later, he was presented by the magistrates and town council to succeed his father as minister of the Edinburgh parish of New Greyfriars.<br>
<br>From the beginning of his ministry, Thomson was active in ecclesiastical politics, and joined with the evangelical, or popular, party in the church courts, in opposition to the ascendant moderate party. He combined his evangelicalism with whig political commitments. In 1805, he championed John Leslie, the whig natural philosopher, in a successful contest against the moderate party candidate, Thomas MacKnight, for the Edinburgh chair of mathematics. Two years later, Thomson joined with David Brewster and several young whig evangelicals in commencing the multi-volume <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopedia</span>, for which Thomson eventually wrote forty-three articles. In 1810, together with several whig evangelicals, Thomson founded the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Christian Instructor</span>, a monthly magazine intended to do in the religious world what the whig <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> was doing in the political world&#151;that is, offer a lively critique of the established order in church and state, and press for the reform of abuses and an increased recognition of the popular voice. Thomson edited the <span class="italic">Christian Instructor</span> for twenty years, making it an organ for the rising evangelical party.<br>
<br>In 1814 Thomson was translated by the Edinburgh magistrates and town council to the splendid St George's Church, recently completed in the prosperous New Town. It was a controversial appointment, as many of the wealthy parishioners were cool toward evangelicalism, which they associated with enthusiasm. In the event, Thomson soon attracted a large and influential congregation. He delivered carefully composed sermons, employing a refined language and emphasizing practical Christian virtues, which appealed to the Edinburgh &eacute;lite. He also won favour through his regular pastoral visiting. Thomson was a cultivated man, with a particular love and talent for music, and he insisted on a high quality of singing in worship. In 1820 he published a collection of psalm tunes, <span class="italic">Sacred Harmony</span>, which contained thirteen original compositions of his own, including the popular &#145;Redemption&#146; and &#145;St George's, Edinburgh&#146;. His keen interest in furthering popular education led him in 1823 to establish a parish day school, St George's Institution: he taught occasionally in the school and prepared school textbooks. He also became a zealous campaigner for the extension of parish schools in Scotland. In 1823, he was granted the degree of DD by Marischal College of Aberdeen.<br>
<br>A man of strong evangelical and reforming convictions, Thomson did not shrink from controversy. A zealous backer of the British and Foreign Bible Society, he became indignant in the early 1820s over the society's decision to include the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> in some of the <span class="roman">Bibles</span> it distributed. Thomson's uncompromising condemnations of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> contributed to a violent controversy. In 1825 he and his supporters broke with the parent Bible Society, and established an independent Edinburgh Bible Society. Thousands in Scotland and England followed their lead. A champion of popular rights in the Church of Scotland, Thomson helped to found in 1825 the Society for the Improvement of Church Patronage, which worked to restore the right of parishioners to select their own ministers. Following the death of Sir Henry Moncrieff-Wellwood in 1827, Thomson was generally acknowledged as the leader of the evangelical party in the Church of Scotland. A long-time advocate of Catholic emancipation, he took a leading part in the final campaign in 1829. He also threw himself into the campaign for the abolition of slavery, insisting upon the immediate liberation of the slaves and opposing those who argued for a gradualist programme. At a great public meeting in October 1830 his stand divided the Edinburgh abolitionists, but Thomson refused to modify his demand for an immediate end to what he viewed as an unspeakable evil.<br>
<br>Thomson died suddenly, of heart failure, in the street outside his Edinburgh home, 29 Melville Street, on 9 February 1831. He was buried, after a great public funeral, in St Cuthbert's churchyard. A man of considerable gifts, his early death was a blow to the evangelical party, which was then gaining an ascendancy within the Church of Scotland. In religion, Thomson was a strict Calvinist and Presbyterian, with his roots in Scotland's covenanting past. In politics, he was a liberal whig, committed to reforms aimed at increasing liberty and popular rights. A genial and generous man in his private life, he was in public life a man of intense convictions and stormy moods, who could direct fierce invective and cutting sarcasm at his opponents. &#145;No man&#146;, wrote his lifelong friend Thomas McCrie, &#145;ever loved or hated him moderately&#146;  (T. McCrie, 137).<br>
