<span class="headword">Cockburn,  Adam, of Ormiston</span>, Lord Ormiston  (<em>c.</em>1656&#150;1735), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was a younger son of John Cockburn of Ormiston (<i>d</i>. 1657), and his wife, Janet Hepburn, daughter of Sir Adam Hepburn of Humbie. He succeeded his elder brother, John, in the lands and barony of Ormiston on 28 December 1671. By the late 1670s he had married Lady Susanna Hamilton, third daughter of John Hamilton, fourth earl of Haddington; they had six children&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45886/', "John Cockburn (1679&#150;1758)")</script>, Charles, Patrick, Adam, Christian, and Anne.<br>
<br>Ormiston first appears in the parliamentary record in June 1678, when he sat in the convention of estates as one of the two commissioners for Haddingtonshire. He was again elected in July 1681, his commission having been disputed but sustained. In May 1685 he was named as one of the commissioners of supply for the shire, a position he was to hold regularly prior to the union. However, Ormiston&#151;described by the Jacobite commentator Colin Lindsay, third earl of Balcarres, as one of the leaders of the presbyterian and discontented party&#151;had few opportunities in public life before the revolution of 1688, when he assumed a far more prominent role in national politics.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1689 Ormiston was again returned a commissioner for Haddingtonshire, and he took his seat in the convention on the 14th of that month. He subscribed both the act declaring the convention a lawful meeting of the estates and the letter of congratulation addressed to the prince of Orange. In April he was one of those appointed to discuss the prospect of a union with England, and elected a member of the committee of estates&#151;a body charged with governing the country in the interval before the convention became a parliament on King William's instruction. The following month he was named a member of the privy council, an office he again occupied in 1696, 1698, and 1707. On 28 November 1692 he was appointed lord justice clerk in place of Sir George Campbell of Cessnock, consequently attending parliament in this capacity as one of the officers of state. In May 1695 Ormiston was part of the commission appointed to inquire into the massacre of Glencoe, the report of which was presented to parliament the following June. For his part in the commission and his conduct as lord justice clerk, Ormiston appears to have been subject to considerable criticism. One contemporary, Dr Houston, remarked:<blockquote>of all the party Lord Ormiston was the most busy, and very zealous in suppressing the rebellion and oppressing the rebels, so that he became universally hated in Scotland, and when ladies were at cards, playing the nine of diamonds, commonly called the curse of Scotland, they called it the Justice Clerk. (Brunton and Haig, 478&#150;80)</blockquote>Nevertheless, that month Ormiston was created a director of the ill-fated Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies. Then on 6 February 1699 Ormiston was created lord treasurer-depute in place of the deceased Lord Raith. He took his new seat in parliament on 21 May 1700. At this point, consistent with his former conduct, he took the oath of allegiance, signed the same with the assurance and association, and took the oath of parliament.<br>
<br>On the accession of Queen Anne, Ormiston was dismissed from office. However, his enforced retirement was not to last long. On 8 January 1705 he obtained a commission restoring him to the office of lord justice clerk and appointing him an ordinary lord of session, both in place of Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw. He assumed his seat as justice clerk on 26 January, and as a lord of session on 31 January. Ormiston was superseded as justice clerk by James Erskine of Grange in 1710, but retained his place as a lord of session. Nevertheless, in 1714, on the accession of George I, Ormiston had the office of justice clerk conferred on him for a third time; he retained it for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Ormiston was one of the first Scottish landowners who endeavoured to introduce long leases of farming land, and as early as 1698 he attempted to break through the old system of short leasing. Similarly it was on his own estate of Ormiston that the fields were enclosed for the first time in Scotland. He was evidently a capable man of considerable diversity, though his talents were matched by his &#145;hot, virulent, turbulent and domineering temper&#146;  (Young, 131). He was described by one contemporary as a gentleman who &#145;entered heartily into the measures of the Revolution, and was zealous all King William's reign, especially for Presbyterian church government&#146;. He was also &#145;too great a bigot in his principles, but in other respects a very fine gentleman, both in person and manners, of strong good sense and great integrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers and Letters</span>, 99). Following the death of his first wife Ormiston married Anne, daughter of Sir Patrick Houston of that ilk and widow successively of Sir James Inglis of Cramond and Sir William Hamilton, Lord Whitelaw; they had one daughter, Jean. Ormiston died at Edinburgh on 16 April 1735, aged about seventy-nine.<br>
