<span class="headword">Forbes,  George Hay</span>  (1821&#150;1875), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal clergyman and liturgical scholar</span>, was born on 4 August 1821 in York Place, Edinburgh, the ninth child in a family of four sons and six daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9842/', "John Hay Forbes, later Lord Medwyn (1776&#150;1854)")</script>, judge of the court of session, and his wife, Louisa (1779&#150;1845), daughter of Sir Alexander Cumming Gordon of Altyre. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9814/', "Alexander Penrose Forbes")</script>, the bishop of Brechin. In 1825 George became permanently disabled, probably due to poliomyelitis. With no formal schooling, he was tutored privately, spending some years in France under orthopaedic specialists. He read extensively in the classics and became an accomplished linguist.<br>
<br>Forbes's family were leaders in the Scottish Episcopal church, and in 1846 he was a founder member of the Gaelic Tract Society in the church. He was ordained deacon in 1848 and priest in 1849. In 1848 he began his life's work&#151;the mission in Burntisland, Fife. There he opened a day school in 1849 and built a parsonage in 1854. He planned a very large church, but only the baptistery was completed (in 1856). In 1869 he was elected to the Burntisland town council and he was later chosen as provost.<br>
<br>In 1852 Forbes began the Pitsligo Press as a vehicle for his own scholarship and for high-church theological views. He edited two series of periodicals aimed at Scottish Episcopalians, wrote a number of works on liturgical theology, contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1874&#150;5), and produced editions of several medieval missals. He translated and edited a number of works, including those of St Gregory of Nyssa and Bishop Thomas Rattray. A frequent traveller to Europe, he corresponded with leading European scholars, including Cardinal Jean-Baptiste Pitra (the Vatican librarian), Charles de Montalembert (a leading French liberal Catholic), and Jacques Migne (the editor and publisher of patristic literature). In 1853 he married Eleanor Maria Irby, daughter of James Wemyss of Cariston, a major in the Scots Greys. It was a happy but childless marriage. They lived simply, most of their income going towards the building of the Burntisland church or the support of the printing press.<br>
<br>Forbes devoted much energy to championing the Scottish communion office, the eucharistic liturgy deriving from the 1637 Scottish <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>; he was one of the instigators and revisers of the controversial edition of 1850, issued by Patrick Torry, bishop of St Andrews. The edition was repudiated by a majority of the Scottish bishops as lacking the authority of the Scottish Episcopal church. Forbes's advocacy of the 1850 prayer book derived from his support for the liturgical and theological standards of the eighteenth-century non-juring Scottish Episcopal church. These he regarded as superior to the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and to the Tractarianism of his brother Bishop Forbes. He believed that lack of knowledge and support for the native non-juring traditions of the Scottish Episcopal church by contemporary Episcopalian clergy exposed the church to Anglicization and Tractarianism. These views also caused Forbes to oppose his brother when the latter was tried for heresy in 1860 over the corporeal presence of Christ in the eucharist. When in 1862 the general synod of the Scottish Episcopal church removed the Scottish communion office from its primacy of authority over the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, Forbes took the Episcopal bishops to court, appealing as far as the House of Lords; he defended his case himself, but lost the action in 1867.<br>
<br>Forbes was the most knowledgeable liturgical scholar of his day in the Scottish Episcopal church, but his published work, and hence his influence, was reduced by an over-strained attention to detail and other scholarly opinion. A man of great personal charm, he was nevertheless stubborn and pugnacious towards those with whom he disagreed. He was one of the most important scholarly forces upholding Scottish traditions in the Scottish Episcopal church against the prevailing Anglicization of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Forbes died at the parsonage, Burntisland, on 7 November 1875 and was buried in the Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, alongside his parents.<br>
