<span class="headword">Nairn,  James</span>  (1629&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and book collector</span>, was born in Edinburgh early in 1629, the son of James Nairn (<i>c</i>.1585&#150;<i>c</i>.1656), a prosperous merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Tod. He entered Edinburgh University in 1646 and graduated MA in 1650. After theological study, combined with a period as librarian of Edinburgh University, 1652&#150;3, and then as chaplain to the countess of Wemyss, he was elected in 1655 to the second charge of the Canongate parish, Edinburgh. He moved to the first charge in 1656.<br>
<br>Conforming to episcopacy after 1660, but influenced by anti-episcopal feeling in his parish, and uneasy about being too near the centre of political life, Nairn, a shy and retiring man, became minister of Bolton, Haddingtonshire, in 1662. He transferred to Wemyss in Fife in 1665. In 1670 he preached in south-west Scotland with five colleagues in an attempt to stem disaffection with episcopacy. This mission was instituted by Robert Leighton, archbishop of Glasgow, an influence on Nairn since the 1650s, when Leighton had been principal of Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Nominated bishop of Dunblane in succession to Leighton in May 1672 Nairn declined the appointment. Poor health was one reason for his decision (he was in Paris having bladder stones excised at this time), but dislike of government ecclesiastical policy was undoubtedly another. However, he did become a king's chaplain-in-ordinary in Scotland in 1675. His health, never robust, continued to decline and he left Wemyss for Edinburgh in April 1678. He died of a urinary infection at a house in the university precincts on 18 July 1678 and was buried on 21 July. He never married.<br>
<br>Nairn made two bequests to Edinburgh University: &pound;4000 Scots for divinity bursaries, and, more important, his book collection, numbering more than 1900 titles. This was a very large library in Scottish terms for the period. With a well-structured and wide content range, and collected over a relatively short period of time, it is a unique source for the study of the intellectual climate of Scotland in the Restoration period. A detailed catalogue, prefaced by a biography in Latin, was printed in the year of its bequest. It shows that Nairn was responsive to current European thought, as the collection contained works by Descartes and his followers and even Spinoza, as well as by Jansenist, Anglican, and mainstream Catholic scholars. Robert Boyle was particularly well represented and there were several contemporary works on natural history, medicine, and mineralogy. The library was also strong on Latin classics and works of history, geography, and political theory, but sadly weak on vernacular English literature.<br>
<br>Nairn was admired by contemporaries as an eloquent preacher, and was an influence on several clerical colleagues, notably Gilbert Burnet, later bishop of Salisbury. He declared Nairn to be &#145;the brightest man I ever knew among all our Scotish divines&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, ed. Burnet and Burnet, 1.215). Another friend was the theologian Lawrence Charteris. No literary remains by Nairn survive, except notes taken by others of some sermons, always delivered extempore.<br>
