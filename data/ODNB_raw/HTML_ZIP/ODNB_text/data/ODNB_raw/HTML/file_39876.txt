<span class="headword">Wootton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Adam]</span>,  Barbara Frances</span>, Baroness Wootton of Abinger  (1897&#150;1988), <span class="occ">economist and social scientist</span>, was born on 14 April 1897 in Cambridge, the only daughter and youngest of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30331/', "James Adam (1860&#150;1907)")</script>, tutor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and his wife, Adela Marion Kensington, classicist and a fellow of Girton. Her father had been born into the family of a farm worker in Aberdeenshire, whence he made his way by scholarship from village school to Cambridge University and a degree in classics.<br>
<br>Barbara herself was healthy, good-looking, and precocious. Her father died when she was ten and he only forty-seven. Her best schoolfriend died at school, and her brother Arthur in war. She was then widowed by war. Her husband, John Wesley (Jack) Wootton, a research student at Trinity College, Cambridge, and the son of Arthur Wootton, from a nonconformist manufacturing family in Nottingham, was a friend of her elder brother Neil. They were married on 5 September 1917 and had thirty-six hours together before she saw him off to France at Victoria Station. He died of wounds on 11 October 1917 and in due course the War Office returned to her his bloodstained uniform. It is reasonable to speculate that the phobias and obsessions which plagued her had their origins in these adversities. Yet she herself remained resolutely pre-Freudian in her attitudes towards responsibility in the face of disaster. Utter self-reliance was her creed. &#145;We would do better&#146;, she thought, &#145;to encourage children from the earliest possible age, however wretched their backgrounds, to believe that they are, or at least soon will be, masters of their fates.&#146;<br>
<br>Though Barbara prayed earnestly to be sent away to school like her brothers, she did not escape the home nursery until at thirteen she was allowed to enter the Perse High School for Girls in Cambridge as a day pupil. Her mother wanted her to study classics at Girton College, and she was dutifully successful in the entrance examinations, becoming a candidate for the first part of the tripos, even though her strong personal inclination was to abandon dead languages for Alfred Marshall and modern economics. As her final examinations approached she succumbed, apparently psychosomatically, to virulent tonsillitis. Her illness caused her to get an <i>aegrotat</i> degree (1918). Liberation from the well intentioned matriarchal dominion of her childhood began with part two of the tripos. She put aside the Greek and Latin texts and turned to read economics with determined enthusiasm. She gained a first class in 1919. Yet, ironically, as a woman she was prevented from appending BA to her name.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge Wootton took up a research studentship at the London School of Economics. In 1920 Girton recalled her to a fellowship and the directorship of social studies in the college, and the board of economics invited her to lecture on economics and the state. The University of Cambridge at this time did not officially allow the admission of women and therefore could not license lectures by a non-member. Hubert Henderson intervened gallantly, offering himself as the advertised lecturer but on the understanding that the university would add in brackets that the lectures would be delivered by Mrs Wootton.<br>
<br>Wootton married again in 1935, her second husband being George Percival Wright, the son of Thomas Wright, of 29 Prothero Road, London. He was her colleague in adult education and London government, and was temporarily a cab driver. There was no permanent peace, for Wright turned out to be a &#145;natural polygamist&#146;, who kept a succession of &#145;secondary wives&#146; round the corner, though making it clear to each that his loyalty to Barbara was paramount. She nursed him through a long illness until he died of cancer in 1964. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Wootton forsook not only the classics but also conventional scholarship and institutional religion. Her circumstances and her temperament gradually formed her into a rationalist, an agnostic, and a socialist&#151;a method, a philosophy, and a commitment which lent steady consistency to a long professional and public life. Her rationalism evolved, no doubt, in part from sheer intellectual power but also from the experience of bereavement and the illogicality of a gifted woman's place in her society. Her agnosticism was nurtured by deep scepticism about the benevolence of any conceivable deity or principle of cosmic order in the First World War. Her socialism was rooted in the same experiences which convinced her that, given sympathy for others, critical reason was the only road to salvation on this earth.<br>
<br>Wootton worked for the research department of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress from 1922, as principal of Morley College from 1926, and as director of studies for tutorial classes at London University from 1927 until she took up a readership at Bedford College in 1944. In that year she was disappointed in a competition for the chair and headship of the department of social science at the London School of Economics, which went to T. H. Marshall. Within academe her preoccupation was always with practical problems. She was promoted to the rank of professor in 1948. She became an acknowledged expert in criminology, penology, and social work, writing many books on those subjects. Her <span class="italic">Social Science and Social Pathology</span> (with V. G. Seal and R. Chambers, 1959) remains a classic in the application of utilitarian philosophy and empirical sociology to the enlightened management of society. From 1952 to 1957 she was Nuffield research fellow at Bedford College.<br>
<br>Wootton became an outstandingly vigorous public figure. She was a governor of the BBC from 1950 to 1956 and served on four royal commissions (workmen's compensation, 1938&#150;44; the press, 1947&#150;9; the civil service, 1953&#150;5; and the penal system, 1964&#150;6). She was also chairman of the Countryside Commission (1968&#150;70). Created a life peer in 1958, she was the first woman to sit on the woolsack in the House of Lords, as deputy speaker from 1967. Her ambivalence to the upper chamber surprised some democratic socialists. She recognized that it was &#145;totally indefensible in a democracy&#146;. &#145;No one in his senses would invent the present house if it did not already exist &hellip; but &hellip; ancient monuments are not light-heartedly to be destroyed.&#146; More generally she made the best of the institutions she found and was unwilling to see her country pay the price in misery to ordinary people that revolution along Stalinist lines would entail. She preferred to work piecemeal, and her service as a justice of the peace for London, to which she was appointed in 1926 at the age of twenty-nine, that is, before she was entitled as a woman to vote, is a long record of humane public effort. She held thirteen honorary doctorates and was made a CH in 1977. She died on 11 July 1988 at her house, Holmesdale Park, Coopers Hill Road, Nutfield, Surrey, admired by those who knew her, honoured by a Festschrift, and widely revered as a woman whose steadfast faith was in argument and persuasion towards a socialist commonwealth.<br>
