<span class="headword">Thomson,  George</span>  (1792&#150;1838), <span class="occ">tutor and chaplain</span> in the household of Sir Walter Scott, was the eldest son of George Thomson (1758&#150;1835), and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Robert Gillon of Lessudden, Roxburghshire. He was born at Melrose, Roxburghshire, on 7 May 1792, his father having been licensed by the presbytery of Dunblane on 4 July 1786, and called to Melrose about two years later. He caused the church to be moved from the abbey and a new building erected near at hand in 1810.<br>
<br>From a young age George did his utmost to relieve the necessities of his family, as his father's stipend was very small. He not only educated himself with the aid of a bursary, but took upon himself the education of two brothers out of his small income. In 1812 Scott wrote that his son was being tutored by Thomson, who walked between Melrose and Abbotsford &#145;with one leg of wood, and another of oak&#146;  (Lockhart, 3.8). As well as a respect for Thomson's learning, Scott had a special kindness for him, which was strengthened by Thomson's mishap&#151;he had lost a leg in some rough play during childhood and had refused to give the name of the boy involved. Thomson was tall and vigorous, an expert fencer and a dashing horseman, despite his infirmity, and Scott remarked of him that accident had spoiled &#145;as bold and fine looking a grenadier as ever charged bayonet against a Frenchman's throat&#146;  (Lockhart, 4.248). Thomson's personality was characterized, like that of his father, by independence and simplicity. To Scott, there was &#145;an eccentricity about him that defies description&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 1.67), although it seems that he may have intended to capture some of it in his depiction of Dominie Sampson in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>; Thomson himself did not discourage the belief that he was the original of that character. On one occasion, after a day's hunting at Abbotsford, Thomson kept the company waiting while he extemporized an exceptionally lengthy form of grace.<br>
<br>Scott frequently tried, though without success, to get Thomson a permanent post. Writing in 1819 to the duke of Buccleuch, he says, &#145;He is nearer Parson Adams than any living creature I ever saw&#151;very learned, very religious, very simple, and extremely absent&#146;  (Lockhart, 3.247). He added that he was a very fair preacher and a staunch anti-Gallican. In 1820 Thomson left Abbotsford to coach the sons of Mrs Dennistoun of Colgrain, but Scott still hoped to procure him a &#145;harbour on his lee&#146;  (ibid., 5.33). He went to see Scott at Christmas 1825, when his kind heart and eccentricities were again noted in the <span class="italic">Journal</span>. In 1830 Scott was still petitioning the duke of Buccleuch on Thomson's behalf. Thomson died at Edinburgh on 8 January 1838. His only literary production seems to have been an &#145;Account of the parish of Melrose&#146; contributed to Sir John Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (1791&#150;9).<br>
