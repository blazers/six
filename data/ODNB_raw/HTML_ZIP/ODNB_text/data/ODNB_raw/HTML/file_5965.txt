<span class="headword">Collinson, Sir  Richard</span>  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">naval officer and explorer</span>, was born on 7 November 1811 at Gateshead, co. Durham, where his father, the Revd John Collinson (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;1857), was rector. His mother was Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> King (<i>b</i>. 1783), daughter of the philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15561/', "Frances Elizabeth King")</script>. He entered the navy in December 1823, and in 1828 served as a midshipman of the <i>Chanticleer</i> (Captain Forster) in a surveying voyage round South America. In 1834 he was a mate of the <i>Medea</i>, one of the first steamers in the navy; he was promoted lieutenant on 23 March 1835 and appointed on 28 September to the surveying vessel <i>Sulphur</i>. In June 1838 he was appointed to the <i>President</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Ross in the Pacific; and in January 1840 to the <i>Wellesley</i>, on which Sir James John Gordon Bremer subsequently hoisted his broad pennant as senior officer in China. During the First Opium War Collinson was employed as surveyor and pilot, and to his skill and ability was largely due the success of the operations both in the Canton River and especially in the Yangtze (Yangzi) River. After commanding for some time the brig <i>Bentinck</i> on this service, he was promoted commander on 19 February 1842, was advanced to post rank on 23 December 1842, and was nominated a CB the following day. However, he continued in command of the <i>Bentinck</i>, renamed the <i>Plover</i>, until 1846, during which time he was employed in the exact survey of the coast of China, from Chushan to Hong Kong, the results of which afterwards formed the basis of the navigational publication <span class="italic">China Pilot</span>.<br>
<br>In 1849 Collinson was appointed to command an expedition for the relief of Sir John Franklin, by way of the Bering Strait; he himself had command of the <i>Enterprise</i>, and with him was Commander Robert Le Mesurier McClure in the <i>Investigator</i>. The two ships sailed together from Plymouth on 20 January 1850 but unfortunately separated in the neighbourhood of Cape Horn and did not meet again. The <i>Enterprise</i> passed Point Barrow, Alaska, on 21 August, but the ice forced Collinson to return south and winter in Hong Kong. In 1851 he was again hampered by ice and in 1852 was frozen in at Cambridge Bay for the winter. In 1853 the <i>Enterprise</i> was caught in the ice at Camden Bay, and there passed a third winter. She reached Point Barrow on 8 August 1854, after being shut up in the Arctic, entirely on her own resources, for upwards of three years. Of the many who had searched for Franklin, Collinson came closest to the place where the expedition had ended. Collinson's addition to geographical knowledge on this Arctic trip was very considerable, and would have been tantamount to the discovery of the north-west passage, had this not been already actually achieved by the men of the <i>Investigator</i>. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him its gold medal in 1858, but he had expected some official reward and was mortified by the scanty acknowledgement his service received. He never again applied for employment under the Admiralty, though he acted on commissions on the naval defence of the Great Lakes, and of the United Kingdom generally.<br>
<br>Collinson attained his flag in 1862; became a vice-admiral (retired) in 1869; and admiral (retired) in 1875, in which year he was also made a KCB. In 1857 he had settled at Ealing, Middlesex, and there, with his mother and sisters, spent the remainder of his life. In 1862 he was elected an elder brother of Trinity House, and in 1875 to be deputy master, an appointment rarely conferred on an officer of the Royal Navy. He was an active fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, serving for many years on its council and in 1871 assisting in editing the <span class="italic">Hints to Travellers</span>. In 1862 he contributed &#145;Three weeks in Canada&#146; to Francis Galton's <span class="italic">Vacation Tourists</span> and edited for the Hakluyt Society <span class="italic">The Three Voyages of Martin Frobisher in Search of a Passage to Cathaia</span> (1867). He was also active in local affairs, serving as churchwarden, on the local board, and in other offices of the parish and district. He died on 12 September 1883 at his home, The Haven, Ealing, Middlesex, and was buried at nearby Perivale, where a monument to his memory was erected by subscription.<br>
