<span class="headword">Arthur</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>in or before 6th cent.), <span class="occ">legendary warrior and supposed king of Britain</span>, has an attested career that is entirely posthumous. From obscure beginnings in British legend, he became internationally known in the twelfth century, particularly through the success of Geoffrey of Monmouth's imaginative <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span> (<i>c</i>.1138). He then became a central figure in a new literary form, the romance, and his career in literature and the arts, adapted for successive tastes and purposes, has continued to the present day. Arthur has been a subject of debate between romantics and sceptics from the twelfth century onwards. From the earliest records (ninth century) through to early modern times two strands of tradition are discernible, one learned and often historicizing, the other popular and fantastic, less well attested, but also feeding into the literary tradition. Within the literary tradition itself there is a contrast between those works whose authors have accepted a minimum historical outline, and have built around that, and those in which there is no concern for historicity, only the elaboration of the developed, and obviously fictional, legend.<h2>
<a name="ThequestionofthehistoricalArthur"></a>The question of the historical Arthur</h2>Arthur is not mentioned in any contemporary record. The earliest datable source which mentions him is the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> (attributed to Nennius), composed in Wales <i>c</i>.829&#150;830. This is a history of the inhabitants of Britain, intended to link them into biblical and classical history. Its main themes are the Roman rule of Britain, the Saxon invasions encouraged by the wicked king Vortigern, and the attempts of St Germanus to convert the British to Christianity despite Vortigern's opposition. This text already displays two different images of Arthur, one apparently semi-historical (chap. 56, a list of his battles and associated legendary achievements), the other patently legendary (chap. 73, magical local folklore attached to his name).<br>
<br>The historical dimension appears in the statement (chap. 56) that Arthur fought against the Saxons as <i>dux bellorum</i>, &#145;battle-leader&#146;, of the British kings in the sixth century; Arthur himself is not referred to as a king. He is said to have fought twelve successful battles, at nine named places. These are: first at the mouth of a River Glein; then four above a River Dubglas in the region of Linnuis; sixth above a River Bassas; seventh in the &#145;Caledonian Wood&#146; &#145;Coit Celidon&#146;; eighth at a castle called Guinnion; ninth at the &#145;City of the Legion&#146;; tenth on the shore of a River Tribruit; eleventh on a hill called Agned (or, in some manuscripts, on a hill called Breguoin or Bregion); twelfth on the hill of Badon, where Arthur alone killed 960 men in a single day.<br>
<br>There have been many attempts to identify these locations. It has been suggested that the source of the list could have been an Old Welsh poem celebrating victories attributed to Arthur, and, if so, that traces of its rhymes may survive in some of the names (Bassas and Dubglas; Celidon, Guinnion, Cair Legion, Bregion, and Badon). The exaggeration of Arthur's achievement at Badon would be consistent with poetic hyperbole. Whether or not that is so, it is recognized that the list may incorporate famous battles, here attracted to Arthur's name, but actually fought under another leader. The assertion that four of the battles were fought at a single location has suggested to some that the number of battles may have been altered to reach a round total of twelve. Several of the names are not otherwise known as battlesites, or at all (Bassas; Dubglas, seemingly in Lincolnshire though not known there; Guinnion; Agned); others have more than one possible identification (Glein, the River Glen in Lincolnshire or Northumberland; the &#145;City of the Legion&#146;, Chester or Caerleon-on-Usk); the &#145;Caledonian Wood&#146; was in Scotland, and is mentioned elsewhere in Welsh legend. Apart from Badon (discussed below), only one of these nine locations is linked with Arthur in any other source, namely that on the &#145;shore of <i>Tribruit</i>&#146;, which is the same as the &#145;strands of <i>Trywruid</i>&#146;, mentioned in an early Welsh poem as the location of a battle fought by Arthur's men, but also unlocated.<br>
<br>Owing to the lack of circumstantial information or external evidence concerning the names in the list, many theories and identifications are possible. The names of the battles have been variously sought, and optimistically located, in Scotland, the English midlands, south-eastern England (Sussex and Kent), and indeed all over Britain. By reading between the lines, it has proved possible to establish Arthur's strategy, and to discover a cavalry or a naval commander, a champion of Roman Britain or of Christianity, or an opponent of the church. The best discussions of this much-studied passage are still those of K. H. Jackson (1946&#150;59) and T. Jones (1964).<br>
<br>The last battle, Badon, is the best attested, for it is also named by Gildas, a contemporary, and in the later Welsh annals (see below); but Gildas notably fails to mention Arthur at all, and seems to imply that the leader at Badon was Ambrosius Aurelianus. This silence by Gildas, who was born in the year that the battle was fought, as he asserts, has never been satisfactorily explained by proponents of a historical Arthur who fought the English in the fifth or early sixth centuries. An Arthur who had been famously successful against the English before Gildas's time would be expected to appear beside Ambrosius in his account.<br>
<br>The location of Badon remains uncertain. The popular identification with Bath has a long history, going back to Geoffrey of Monmouth. However, Bath is an English name, so is very unlikely to have been used by Gildas; nor is Bath likely to have had an established English name as early as his time. The best suggestion is that Badon is one of several hill forts called Badbury, all in southern Britain (the recurrence of the name has not been satisfactorily explained, nor its meaning); Badbury Rings, near Wimborne Minster in Dorset, may be the likeliest of these.<h2>
<a name="TheWelshannals"></a>The Welsh annals</h2>The other early and apparently historical references to Arthur appear in <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>. This text contains two references to Arthur. In a year which can be calculated as 516 appears the entry, &#145;Bellum Badonis, in quo Arthur portavit crucem Domini nostri Jhesu Christi tribus diebus et tribus noctibus in humeros suos, et Brittones victores fuerunt&#146; (&#145;The battle of Badon, in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ for three days and nights on his shoulders; and the British were victors&#146;); and under a year calculable as 537 the entry, &#145;Gueith Camlann, in qua Arthur et Medraut corruerunt&#146; (&#145;The battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medrawd fell&#146;). The battle of Camlann is additional to the twelve battles listed in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>; presumably it did not belong among Arthur's victories over the Anglo-Saxons. Its location is again unknown; the name, meaning &#145;crooked bank&#146;, occurs in Romano-British form on Hadrian's Wall (Camboglanna, the fort at Castlesteads, Cumberland) and more than once in Wales. Geoffrey of Monmouth located it in Cornwall, probably for literary purposes. It is notable to find Arthur's name linked with that of Medrawd (the later Modred), but the annalist does not say whether they were on the same or opposing sides, nor whether Arthur's opponents were other British or the English.<br>
<br>Both the annals and the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> thus credit Arthur with a victory at Badon; but their evidence is not independent. The first entry in <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, referring to Arthur carrying Christ's cross on his shoulders at Badon, echoes a comment in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> concerning another of Arthur's battles, at Guinnion: &#145;bellum in castello Guinnion, in quo Arthur portavit imaginem sanctae Mariae perpetuae virginis super humeros suos&#146; (&#145;a battle at Castle Guinnion, in which Arthur carried the image of holy Mary, ever-virgin, upon his shoulders&#146;), and the pagans were turned to flight with great slaughter. Although the differences indicate that neither statement is drawn directly from the other, they can hardly be unrelated. The earliest copy of the annals (BL, Harley MS 3859, dated <i>c</i>.1100), also contains a text of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> (as well as some early Welsh genealogies which do not mention Arthur), so the histories of the two texts are associated. It has been suggested that, in both cases, the words <i>humeros suos</i> (&#145;his shoulders&#146;) are due to a confusion of Old Welsh <i>iscuid</i> (&#145;shoulder&#146;) with <i>iscuit</i> (&#145;shield&#146;), the two words being often linked in Welsh poetry of the ninth century and later. If so, it is curious that Welsh authors, familiar with the vocabulary, made the same confusion in both accounts. The statement in the annals is reminiscent of Constantine's carrying the symbol of Christ, and having it painted on his soldiers' shields, at the battle of the Milvian Bridge, outside Rome, in 312, when he gained control of the empire. The idea of Arthur as a champion of Christianity became a recurrent theme of the developed legend, particularly in the thirteenth century when his association with the legend of the holy grail became prominent.<br>
<br>The two entries in the annals, and possibly the battles listed in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, or some of them, are the only recorded events which can be associated with a historical Arthur, if he existed in the sixth century. The texts in which they occur were compiled long after the events which they purport to record. The Welsh annals of the early period (including the sixth century) include retrospective entries, added in the light of later events (for instance the births of St Brigid and St Columba, given in 454 and 521); and the annal entries were also prone to collect additional legendary comments. Under 573 an entry for the battle of Armterid (Arthuret in Cumbria) states that Merlin went mad in the battle; this statement is not found in the Harleian text, but is added in a later version of the annals. (Merlin's association with Arthur is first found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's history, <i>c</i>.1138.) The clauses mentioning Arthur in the annal entries could both be later additions of this kind, made between the first compilation of the annals (probably in the late eighth century) and the copying of the earliest extant manuscript <i>c</i>.1100&#151;perhaps when they were revised in the mid-tenth century. Even if the entries belonged to the original compilation, they would have been written two and a half centuries after Arthur's supposed time, if it was at the period which they claim. The entries therefore carry little or no historical weight for events of the sixth century, though they are important as showing what was believed in Wales.<h2>
<a name="OtherpossibilitiesforahistoricalArthur"></a>Other possibilities for a historical Arthur</h2>The poverty of the evidence is such that those who wish to hypothesize a historical figure behind the legends need not confine themselves to the sixth century. Arthur's name is derived from one used in the Roman empire, Artorius; at least eleven men of this name are recorded in the first to third centuries. Most had nothing to do with Britain, but one who did is Lucius Artorius Castus, a native of Dalmatia who led two legions from Britain against a rebellion in Armorica (modern Brittany) in the late second or the third century. What is known of his activities has nothing in common with the Arthurian legends as reflected in the earliest sources. The only common ground between the two is the leading of an army to the continent (first attributed to Arthur by Geoffrey of Monmouth); but that attribute does not constitute a strong argument without a hypothesis of British legends about Lucius Artorius Castus which survived, unrecorded, to the twelfth century.<br>
<br>Another British war leader who led troops to the continent has also been suggested as the original Arthur. This is a Briton known in fifth-century continental sources as Riothamus (for Riotamus). However, as he has the wrong name, he is an even less likely original; and he suffers from the same drawback as Lucius Artorius Castus, in that his known activities have nothing in common with those of Arthur found in the earliest (ninth-century) sources, only with those of the legendary figure later portrayed by Geoffrey of Monmouth. At most it is possible that Riotamus's military activities may have provided part of the basis for the continental conquests which Geoffrey included in his portrayal of Arthur.<br>
<br>One other reference which potentially has historical significance is an allusion in the early Welsh poem the <span class="italic">Gododdin</span>, purportedly composed by Aneirin in what is now Scotland in the sixth century, though the date and place are both uncertain. Since the manuscript (Cardiff Central Library, MS 1) is of the thirteenth century, it is unknown whether the allusion was part of the original composition (of whatever date) or belongs among those portions which are agreed to have been composed later. A hero is praised for having &#145;glutted black crows on the wall of the fort, though he was not Arthur&#146;, an understatement typical of the poem. Arthur here represents an impossible standard of comparison, which even the bravest hero could not match: this is consistent with the Arthur of both chapter 56 and chapter 73 of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, the military leader and the folklore hero.<h2>
<a name="Theevidenceofpersonalnames"></a>The evidence of personal names</h2>The scarcity of references to people called Arthur in the pre-Norman Brittonic world has been noted. With the exception of Brittany, where the name seems to have been used slightly more, instances hardly occur. A single instance is a Welsh <i>Noe</i> (or <i>Nouy</i>) <i>filius</i> <i>Arthur</i>, &#145;son of Arthur&#146;, in the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Llandaff</span>; he is named as the grantor in a doubtful charter which may be of approximately the seventh century, but he could be a figment of the twelfth-century compiler. However, in the late sixth and the seventh centuries, men bearing this name do occur in one particular context, the Irish settlements in western Britain. Four men called Artur (a likely Irish form for Brittonic Arthur) are recorded, reasonably well attested as historical characters, all within the world of the Irish settlements in western Britain&#151;two within D&aacute;l Riata (the Irish-Scottish settlement in what is now Argyll), one in northern Ireland in a D&aacute;l Riat&igrave;s context, and the fourth in Dyfed (south-west Wales). All four can be approximately dated to the late sixth or the seventh century. It has been suggested that these men's names commemorated an earlier British leader of great renown who had the same name&#151;reflections implying a substantial presence, though such commemorative naming is not readily paralleled in medieval Celtic societies. An alternative explanation is that the use of the name resulted from Irish acquaintance with British folk-tales about a legendary hero, one whose name was not current in British families perhaps because the figure of legend carried the wrong kind of resonances (in the way that &#145;Galahad&#146; and &#145;Gandalf&#146;, for example, have not been popular Christian names); but that Irish families did not have the same reluctance to use it. Their readiness could have been encouraged by the existing Irish first-name Art.<br>
<br>Some commentators have pointed out that a significant proportion of the early evidence concerning Arthur comes from the north of England or from Scotland, suggesting that this may have been his original region of activity, with his fame spreading south to Wales and beyond, as other legends are known to have done. (The &#145;Old North&#146; was the chief location of heroic activity in medieval Welsh literature.) The evidence for this view is: the context of the battle-list in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, which places it adjacent to northern material; the fact that the only battlesite identifiable with assurance belongs (albeit vaguely) in Scotland (&#145;the Caledonian Wood&#146;); the reference in the <span class="italic">Gododdin</span>, a poem which portrays the heroic world of southern Scotland; and the fact that two of the four men bearing the name Artur occur in Scotland. None of this evidence is strong, and Welsh tradition, followed by Geoffrey of Monmouth, associated Arthur primarily with Cornwall, and also with local landmarks or place names in Wales. There is no bias towards a northern Arthur within the Welsh tradition itself, although that did generally favour a northern location for its heroes.<br>
<br>Overall, there is no need for a historical Arthur to explain the references to him in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> and the Welsh annals; but if there was one he could have been a fifth- or sixth-century war leader against the English, as those texts claim, or a second- or third-century Roman leader of British troops to the continent. No contemporary text mentions him; but the paucity of British texts from the fourth to the seventh centuries means that the silence, apart from that of Gildas, is not of great weight. There might be room to postulate a historical person, of whom nothing is known, behind the legends. The strongest argument in favour of such a person may be his name, for it could be argued that a figure which was purely legendary would be unlikely to have borne a name of Latin derivation.<h2>
<a name="Literaryreferences"></a>Literary references</h2>The early literary references appear mainly in Welsh, which has the richest and earliest literature surviving in a Brittonic language. However, there is also evidence, scanty but clear, that Arthur was a hero of popular legend in Brittany, Cornwall, and southern Scotland&#151;a pan-Brittonic hero of local folklore. These legends mainly took the form of ascribing an Arthurian origin to notable features of the landscape, but there was also a belief that Arthur was not dead, a subject on which the Bretons and Cornish were known to be easily baited (as is learned in the mid-twelfth century, from Herman de Tournai's account of the miracles of Our Lady of Laon).<br>
<br>The earliest such local legends are two recorded in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> in its list of the <i>mirabilia</i>, &#145;wonders&#146;, of Britain. Out of thirteen such wonders, two (chap. 73) concern Arthur. As in the list of his battles (chap. 56), so in chapter 73 Arthur is not termed a &#145;king&#146;; here he is twice referred to as <i>Arthur</i> <i>miles</i> (&#145;Arthur the soldier&#146;). A rock on top of a mountain &#145;in the region called Buelt&#146; (Builth, Brecknockshire) had a dog's pawprint impressed upon it. The explanation given is that when Arthur was hunting a boar called Troit, his dog Cabal (&#145;horse&#146;) left its pawprint there, and Arthur later erected a cairn on the spot, called Carn Cabal, &#145;the rock-pile of Cafall&#146; (now Carn Gafallt, near Rhayader). The wonder was that even if people should remove the stone overnight, it would be found back on its cairn the following day. The pursuit of the boar Troit forms a major part of the Arthurian tale &#145;Culhwch and Olwen&#146; (possibly of the early twelfth century), and the ninth-century reference shows that this part of the tale, at least, existed at that date, localized in this instance in mid-Wales. The second wonder was the grave of Arthur's son, Amr, whom Arthur himself had killed in combat. The grave is said to be of variable length, and it bore the name Licat Amr, &#145;the eye of Amr&#146; (probably in fact meaning &#145;source of the [river] Gamber&#146;). Nothing more is known of this tale.<br>
<br>The tradition of local legends linked to notable landmarks was not restricted to the early period; it continued through the twelfth century and into the modern era. Canons from Laon, journeying through southern England in 1113, were shown &#145;Arthur's seat&#146; and &#145;Arthur's oven&#146; while travelling through Devon to Cornwall. Numerous local features, often named as pieces of Arthur's household furniture (seats, tables, and ovens especially) appear at all dates down to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Neolithic cromlechs called &#145;Arthur's Quoit&#146; (a name often interchanged with &#145;Giant's Quoit&#146;) attest his giant stature and his ability to throw such objects in sport. This is the non-literary tradition, poorly attested, especially in the early period, but remarkable for its consistency over a thousand years. Later examples of such names are often assumed to be due to the later literary tradition; but they actually have more in common with the earliest legendary references than with the literary King Arthur of Camelot. While their popularity or preservation may owe something to feedback from the literary tradition, their form seems to be authentically popular and ancient. In many of the references there are hints that Arthur was of giant stature, and his folklore has much in common with that of giants. The references in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> may contain allusions to this belief (including the fact that his dog's name meant &#145;horse&#146;).<br>
<br>There are fuller manifestations of this folklore tradition in Welsh literature. Best is the story of &#145;Culhwch and Olwen&#146;, an expanded folktale telling how Culhwch, Arthur's nephew, enlisted the help of Arthur and his men to win a giant's daughter as his bride. The impossible tasks set as conditions by the reluctant father-in-law are achieved in a wild romp of humour and exaggeration. The most significant task is the hunting of the great <i>Twrch Trwyth</i>, the boar Troit mentioned in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>. The tale is usually dated to <i>c</i>.1100, but the text survives only in manuscripts of the fourteenth century. Arthur appears as the leader of a band of warriors, enumerated with virtuoso panache, many of them invented for linguistic or other comic effect or borrowed from random knowledge: they include &#145;Gwilenhin king of the French&#146;, presumably William the Conqueror, and legendary Irish heroes. As in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span>, Arthur is credited with continental campaigns, the author's enthusiasm here extending them to India and Africa as well as most of Europe including Scandinavia and Greece. He had a court, located at the unidentified &#145;<i>Kelli Wic</i> in Cornwall&#146;, foreshadowing the later King Arthur's court at Camelot, though hardly in atmosphere or ethos. Some of its warriors appear later as knights of the round table, notably Kei (Sir Kay), Bedwyr (Sir Bedivere), and Owein (Yvain); even their characters also continue to some extent: Kei is touchy and sharp-tongued, Bedwyr stalwart and dependable. Arthur takes part in the action when appropriate, in contrast to the figurehead which he became in later romances.<br>
<br>There are two early Welsh poems on Arthurian themes, both probably dating from before Geoffrey of Monmouth's time, their contents at any rate apparently independent of his <span class="italic">Historia regum</span>. One contains material very close to that of &#145;Culhwch&#146;. Known from its opening line as &#145;Pa gur yv y porthaur?&#146; (&#145;What man is the gate-keeper?&#146;), it recites details of Arthur's warriors, of their conquests and escapades (including the &#145;strands of <i>Trywruid</i>&#146;, echoing the battle at Tribruit in the ninth-century <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>) and of men and monsters against whom they had fought. Kei's prowess is particularly prominent, but exploits of Bedwyr and other warriors are also given. Since the poem may be older than Geoffrey's <span class="italic">Historia regum</span>, it is notable that one of Arthur's warriors was the servant of &#145;Uthir Pendragon&#146;<a href="#cosubject_28038"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, an early instance of the name of Arthur's father. The other poem, <span class="italic">Preiddeu Annwn</span> (&#145;The Spoils of Annwn&#146;&#151;the other world), dated between the ninth and twelfth centuries, tells of a single adventure overseas to attack a magical island-fortress in order to rescue a prisoner, a recurrent theme of Welsh Arthurian literature. The recurrent refrain is, &#145;Three shiploads we went there; apart from seven, no one came back&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Thelivesofthesaints"></a>The lives of the saints</h2>Other early Welsh references are mostly allusive, and amplify without altering this picture. Arthur appears in several saints' lives, probably of the twelfth century. He plays the role of a secular figure over whom the saint triumphs, thus demonstrating his own virtue by opposing Arthur, the ultimate adversary. In some cases Arthur then provides the authority by which the saint's monastery holds its land. This may be why the lives sometimes refer to him as a &#145;king&#146; ((<i>rex</i>); they may be the earliest sources to use the term of him. It should be noted that Arthur here is not an evil or pagan tyrant, as other rulers in saints' lives sometimes are, but merely an unpredictable opponent, open to negotiation.<br>
<br>The life in which Arthur plays the fullest role is that of St Cadog, by Lifris of Llancarfan (south-west Wales); the main body of this text, including the passages concerning Arthur, is generally dated <i>c</i>.1090&#150;1110. Arthur is a &#145;most famous king of Britain&#146; (<i>rex illustrissimus</i> <i>Britanniae</i>), and he and his companions Kei and Bedwyr are collectively &#145;three valiant warriors&#146; (<i>tres heroes strenui</i>). They witness the abduction of a princess, destined to be the mother of St Cadog, and her father's pursuit across southern Wales. Arthur's companions remind him that they are accustomed to help those in need or distress (a notable precursor of the chivalrous ethic of the round table). They aid the abductor, making possible the lawful marriage which results in the saint's birth. Later in the same life, a man who has killed one of Arthur's followers takes refuge with St Cadog; Arthur demands compensation from the saint, and insists upon special magical cattle. These are conjured up with the saint's help, but revert to bracken when handed over to Arthur&#151;giving rise to certain local place names which are thereby explained. At this Arthur asks for the saint's forgiveness, and grants his monastery the right of sanctuary.<br>
<br>In the first life of St Carannog or Carantoc (twelfth century) the saint, following his floating altar, arrives in Somerset, to be met by Arthur (termed a <i>rex</i>), who reigns there. The saint asks whether Arthur had found his altar, and Arthur promises to tell him on condition that Carannog rids the land of a troublesome dragon. This the saint easily does, and Arthur in gratitude gives him land in Somerset, and returns the saint's altar, having unsuccessfully tried to use it as a table.<br>
<br>Other references in the saints' lives are more conventional. In the life of St Gildas by Caradoc of Llancarfan (composed in the first half of the twelfth century) Arthur is &#145;king of all greater Britain&#146; (<i>rex totius maioris</i> <i>Britanniae</i>): &#145;greater&#146; as contrasted with &#145;lesser&#146; Britain, or Brittany), but also a &#145;warlike king&#146; (<i>rex rebellis</i>); he kills Gildas's brother, who has plundered and harassed provocatively, and then humbly asks forgiveness of the saint, who grants it. (A later legend, reported by Gerald of Wales in his <span class="italic">Descriptio Cambriae</span>, written in 1194, says instead that Gildas, in vengeance, destroyed books which he had written in praise of Arthur&#151;the earliest, and not the least plausible, of many attempts to explain Gildas's silence concerning Arthur.) Later in this life Arthur lays siege in Glastonbury to Melwas, king of Somerset, who has abducted his queen, Guinevere (Guennuvar). The abbot of Glastonbury and Gildas jointly make peace between them, and the kings in gratitude give lands to Glastonbury.<br>
<br>Overall, the saints' lives show that by about 1100 Arthur was used in south Wales to portray a powerful king when one was needed as a foil to the saint; and they contain further instances of the kind of local folklore which was readily attached to his name. The most notable feature about Arthur, in all the Welsh references, is his lack of an established genealogy or a position in society. Most unusually for a hero, he is not given a patronymic name (only later is he called <i>ab Uthr</i>, &#145;son of Uther&#146;, under the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth) and, unlike most other heroes, he has no particular geographical position but can appear anywhere&#151;Wales, Somerset, and particularly Cornwall in the Welsh legends, and Devon, Scotland, and Brittany in other early references.<h2>
<a name="Mythology"></a>Mythology</h2>One very persistent item of folklore attached to Arthur is the belief that he was not dead, only sleeping, and would come again. Such a belief is widely found attached to other figures, many but not all historical (Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, Owain Glyn D&#373;r, and the Irish Fionn are instances). For Arthur it is first attested in the early twelfth century (in several sources), and since then has recurred as folklore from many parts of Britain. The legend was also located on Mount Etna (Sicily), presumably taken there by Normans; it is first recorded by two authors dating it about 1190&#150;1200, one of them being Gervase of Tilbury, who also records sightings by foresters of Arthur's huntsmen in wild places in Britain. In the earliest sources&#151;and many later ones&#151;Arthur the hunter is quite as important as Arthur the soldier.<br>
<br>A different explanation which has been put forward in the past concerning Arthur is that he was originally a god or mythological figure. Fashion has determined that this view, popular in the nineteenth century, now has few proponents. Its greatest adherent was the Celtic scholar Sir John Rh&#375;s (1840&#150;1915), who kept a foot in each camp by suggesting that there was a historical Arthur who was named after a mythological one. In the enormous range of medieval Arthurian legends there is ample material (events, names, attributes, associations, details) to fit any hypothesis of this kind. The theory is now usually cited only to claim that its abandonment strengthens the case for a historical Arthur.<br>
<br>The generally received view of the historical Arthur today is that he was probably a sixth-century battle leader of the British against the English, as portrayed in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> attributed to Nennius. This view relies on that source and the two references in the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, records composed three to four centuries later. But the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> also contains a contrasting portrayal of Arthur as a giant-like figure of legendary folklore. It is a matter of taste how one views this contrast in the earliest Arthurian document. It may show a historical Arthur already turning into a figure of legend, or a legendary Arthur becoming historicized. The weight of early evidence, and the absence of his name in Gildas, both favour the latter idea. The argument that there must be something behind all legends can be refuted by reference to other fictional heroes of Celtic legend who also became historicized. (For example, the legendary Irish heroes C&uacute; Chulainn, Conaire, and Lugaid appear in the Irish annals in the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, and Conchobar, king of Ulster, was alleged to have died on hearing of the crucifixion, while Merlin as well as Arthur is mentioned in one text of the Welsh annals.) If there was such a war leader in the sixth century, then the battles (or some of them) in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> and the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, at sites which cannot be identified with assurance, are all that can be ascribed to him.<h2>
<a name="GeoffreyofMonmouth"></a>Geoffrey of Monmouth</h2>Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span> was composed about 1138 and purports to give the whole pre-Saxon history of Britain. Geoffrey drew on Gildas, Bede, the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, and Welsh genealogies, but claimed that his work was a translation of an ancient book in the &#145;British tongue&#146;. Arthur forms the centrepiece of the work, but does not appear until two-thirds of the way through it. For the first time he appears as a stately king, with all the trappings of imperial power.<br>
<br>Many of the well-known elements of the fully developed Arthurian legend appear first in Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, and were doubtless due to his own impressive imaginative powers. As in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, Arthur appears in the context of the British resistance against the invading English; but Geoffrey supplies a complete life-history, contrasting with the bare list of battles seen in the earlier work. Arthur was born as the result of an irregular liaison between <a name="cosubject_28038"></a><span class="headword">Uther Pendragon</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>late 5th cent.?), <span class="occ">king of Britain</span> and a Breton by descent, and Igerna, wife of Gorlois, duke of Cornwall. Uther had himself changed by Merlin into the duke's likeness, entered Tintagel Castle (vividly described) on the Cornish coast, and begat Arthur; while he was so occupied, his men killed Gorlois at a siege elsewhere in Cornwall, freeing Igerna for marriage to Uther and thus legitimizing Arthur's birth. Arthur became ruler of Britain after his father's death, and was a paragon of generosity, affluence, courage, military success, and courtliness. He brought the Saxons under control in four battles recalling some of the twelve named in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>; he then conquered a rebellious Scotland, and married Guinevere (Guenhuvera), a woman of noble Roman descent reared in Cornwall. He went on to conquer Ireland, Iceland, and other north Atlantic islands. After twelve years' rule, with knights coming from afar to join his court, Arthur went on to conquer Norway, Denmark, and Gaul. After a further nine years he was crowned in a splendid ceremony at Caerleon.<br>
<br>Arthur's success became provocative to the Roman empire, and he received a message ordering him to appear in Rome to apologize for his behaviour. Having sent a pugnacious reply, he again campaigned on the continent with a large army, leaving his nephew Modred in Britain as caretaker. After killing single-handed a fearsome giant who had abducted and killed a Breton princess, Arthur successfully beat the forces of the Roman empire. The British army was then crossing the Alps to attack Rome when Arthur received news that Modred had seized the crown of Britain, was adulterously cohabiting with Guinevere, and had asked the continental Saxons for military aid. Arthur returned and beat Modred in three battles, the last at the River Camblanus, located in Cornwall by Geoffrey of Monmouth, thus providing a balance between Arthur's conception there and his end. Modred was killed and Arthur was &#145;mortally wounded&#146; (<i>letaliter vulneratus</i>) but was then taken to the Isle of Avalon (<i>insula Avallonis</i>) for his wounds to be healed&#151;Geoffrey's allusion to the legend that he would come again. As king of Britain Arthur was succeeded by Constantine, son of Arthur's closest counsellor, Cador, duke of Cornwall.<br>
<br>Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthur thus combines the historicized Arthur of the <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> and the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span> with a little of the legendary Arthur (the killing of two giants; his sword Caliburnus &#145;made in the Isle of Avalon&#146;; the allusion to his future return). As in earlier Welsh legend (presumably known to Geoffrey), Arthur is closely associated with Cornwall, except that Geoffrey moved his court from there to Caerleon near Monmouth. The association with Cornwall was to prove extremely durable, appearing even in works which lost virtually all other attributes of the traditional figure (for example, Dryden's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>, discussed below). Well-known features of the later legend which appear for the first time in Geoffrey's history include Arthur's parents, Uther Pendragon and Igerna (the Ygraine of romance), and his illegitimate conception at Tintagel; his continental conquests (unless these are foreshadowed by references in the Welsh story &#145;Culhwch&#146;); Arthur's nephew Modred as a traitor and adulterer, usurping both the kingdom and Guinevere (compare Medrawd who died at Camlann with Arthur in the annals); and the Isle of Avalon as the place where Arthur was brought after the last fatal battle. It was also Geoffrey who introduced the figure of Merlin into the story, as both prophet and magician, by combining Myrddin, a prophet who already existed independently in Welsh legend, with another Welsh story (also non-Arthurian) from the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>.<br>
<br>The career of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthur echoes closely that of the legendary Alexander, an already popular theme of medieval narrative; this was doubtless deliberate. Geoffrey's story established the framework which the legend has retained ever since. This included, very importantly, the treacherous end to Arthur's glorious reign: from now on, Arthur is a tragic figure. Notable features of the later legends which are absent from Geoffrey's account include: the atmosphere of chivalry and courtly love (first seen in Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's romances, though Geoffrey has a phrase foreshadowing it); Arthur's unwittingly incestuous liaison with his half-sister Morgause, and Modred as the result of that liaison; the sword in the stone; the lady of the lake as provider of Excalibur (Geoffrey, like Welsh legend, names Arthur's sword, made at Avalon, but does not say how it was acquired); &#145;Camelot&#146; as the name of Arthur's court; the round table (first found in Wace's Norman-French version of Geoffrey's history); and the holy grail. Most of these features were added in the French vulgate cycle, <i>c</i>.1225, discussed below.<h2>
<a name="ResponsestoGeoffreyofMonmouth"></a>Responses to Geoffrey of Monmouth</h2>Geoffrey of Monmouth's history was an immediate success in Britain and elsewhere in western Europe. As well as being circulated and copied rapidly both in Britain and on the continent, it was rendered into Anglo-Norman <i>c</i>.1155 by Wace. The enthusiasm was not universal. Late in the twelfth century William of Newburgh commented that Geoffrey had &#145;cloaked in the respectable name of history fables about Arthur taken from ancient fictions of the British and augmented from his own resources&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, 1.12), a just assessment; and at about the same time Gerald of Wales told of a madman, living (significantly) at Caerleon and possessed by evil spirits, who could be cured by having a copy of <span class="roman">John's gospel</span> placed on his lap, but whom the devils would re-enter, with greater strength, if the gospel were replaced by Geoffrey's history.<br>
<br>There are indications, slight but adequate, that Arthur and legends about him were already known on the continent before Geoffrey of Monmouth's history became known <i>c</i>.1138. This knowledge concerned the legendary rather than the &#145;historical&#146; Arthur. The French knew of the Bretons' belief that Arthur would return, and would argue with them on the subject; and <i>c</i>.1120 the encyclopaedist Lambert de St Omer was interested in the &#145;wonders of Britain&#146; of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, and added a further Arthurian marvel, situated in Scotland, from some other source. In works of art, too, it is the legendary Arthur that appears. The portal of the north door of the cathedral at Modena in north Italy shows Arthur and some of his knights (named) rescuing a lady from a castle defended by a man. The date of the doorway is disputed; it may be slightly earlier or later than Geoffrey's time. In either case the significant point is that the story portrayed seems to be independent of Geoffrey's history and consistent with scenes typical of later romances. At Otranto, in the southern tip of Italy, there survives a mosaic dated 1165, which shows Arthur, mounted on a goat, fighting against a large cat. This probably refers to a story alluded to in the early Welsh poem &#145;Pa gur yv y porthaur?&#146;, and also in later French stories, telling of Arthur's fight against a fearsome cat (<i>Cath Palug</i> in Welsh, <i>le Chapalu</i> in French). Again, the Italian mosaic portrays not Geoffrey's Arthur but that of popular legend&#151;the Arthur of chapter 73 rather than chapter 56 of the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>.<br>
<br>It seems therefore that there existed on the continent a popular tradition of Arthur and his warriors, owing little to Geoffrey of Monmouth's history (though perhaps boosting its popularity in the twelfth century) and deriving, in part, directly from Brittonic legends (Welsh, Cornish, or Breton), in oral or written form. This could be the body of material that formed part of the background to courtly Arthurian romances. The widespread and immediate success of Geoffrey's history may thus have been due not only to its intrinsic literary merits, but also to an existing body of knowledge about Arthur, and maybe an appetite for more information. Geoffrey's achievement, whether intended or not, was that he gave this Arthurian material scholarly respectability (as in William of Newburgh's comment that Geoffrey &#145;cloaked fables about Arthur in the respectable name of history&#146;), thus enabling courtly authors and reciters to take it as a legitimate theme. But the precise routes of transmission of Arthurian and other stories from Celtic legend to French romances remain uncertain. They could have travelled from the Welsh or the Cornish directly to the Anglo-Normans and thus to the continent, as a consequence of the Norman conquest of England; or they could have come from the Bretons, either in their own right or acting as intermediaries passing stories from Britain on to the continent; most likely a mixture of all these, and perhaps others as well. Nor need the material all have come from Celtic legends. The names and scattered references show that some of the material is thus derived, but authors and reciters were fully capable of incorporating material from other sources too, or of inventing it.<br>
<br>Wace's mid-twelfth-century French version of Geoffrey of Monmouth's history is very close to his original (allowing for the fact that Wace used the first variant version of the history), but Wace expanded it by adding speeches, a few names, and authorial comments, resulting in a more vivid narrative, and a more chivalric and courtly atmosphere. Some new features are notable: one is the round table, which Arthur introduced during the twelve years of peace which followed the conquest of the Atlantic islands, to discourage squabbling over precedence at table. Another notable comment is given at Arthur's death, which Wace treats in a manner very similar to Geoffrey's, but adding, &#145;The Bretons still await him&#146;  (lines 13275&#150;90). One consequence of the change from Latin to the vernacular, and from prose to poetry, was that the narrative could no longer pose as sober history, but had become obviously a work of fiction. Arthur's international literary career was launched.<h2>
<a name="TheriseofArthurianromance"></a>The rise of Arthurian romance</h2>Soon after Wace's translation was made, the earliest extant Arthurian verse romances were composed in French (<i>c</i>.1160 onwards): Marie de France's lay <span class="italic">Lanval</span>, and the five surviving romances of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes. <span class="italic">Lanval</span> has been called &#145;the earliest Arthurian romance&#146;, though it is more a verse fairy story which uses Arthur's court as a background: a prince at Arthur's court is taken up by a fairy mistress, and Arthur's queen (unnamed) also attempts to seduce him. Chr&eacute;tien's five Arthurian romances (<i>c</i>.1160&#150;1190) are <span class="italic">Erec et Enide</span>, <span class="italic">Clig&eacute;s</span>, <span class="italic">Le chevalier de la charrete</span> (Lancelot), <span class="italic">Yvain</span> or <span class="italic">Le chevalier au lion</span>, and the unfinished <span class="italic">Perceval</span> or <span class="italic">Le conte del graal</span> (the earliest appearance of the grail legend). These romances used Arthur and his court as a framework for works of psychological introspection and chivalry, each concentrating on a single hero. The romance was a new genre, recently developed for tales relating to antiquity; Chr&eacute;tien was the first, as far as is known, to use it for Arthurian material. His works owe nothing to Geoffrey of Monmouth's history in their plots, which may have come from Welsh, Cornish, or Breton legends, perhaps from other sources as well. Chr&eacute;tien must have known Geoffrey's work, either directly or in Wace's translation, but his romances had no pretension to the status of history. Most importantly, and in contrast with Geoffrey's account (and with earlier Welsh literature), Arthur's role became, as in <span class="italic">Lanval</span>, that of a figure in the background, whose court is a focus of events, but who takes little or no part in the action himself. This is particularly noticeable in his <span class="italic">Perceval</span>, where Arthur's response when his honour is challenged is supine inactivity; the confused and unfinished state of this romance proved an enduring challenge to continuators, in both verse and prose.<br>
<br>Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes also introduced the theme of Guinevere's adultery with Lancelot, and was the first to suggest that Arthur's court and its chivalry might represent a flawed ideal; but its central flaws (Arthur's unwitting incest which produced Modred, and his studied disregard of Guinevere's adultery) are not seen in Chr&eacute;tien's romances, and do not appear until about 1215&#150;35, in the <span class="italic">Mort Artu</span> of the prose vulgate cycle. Merlin makes no appearance (except for one passing allusion), though he was by now independently enjoying his own literary career, in Latin, as a result of the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's &#145;Prophecies of Merlin&#146; and the industry of explanatory commentaries spawned by the obscurity of that work; in vernacular literature he returned to the Arthurian fold <i>c</i>.1200, in the prose romance based on Robert de Boron's verse <span class="italic">Merlin</span>. Chr&eacute;tien may have been the first author to place Arthur's court at &#145;Camelot&#146;; but its single mention in one text could be a later insertion into the poem. The name became much more popular in the following century, ousting Geoffrey's Caerleon. The place name itself could be derived indirectly from Camulodunum, the Romano-British name for Colchester in Essex, but it is most unlikely that the French authors who introduced and used the name had any actual place in mind. Camelot has subsequently been identified, among other places, with Winchester (Malory) and South Cadbury in Somerset (Leland); and King Arthur's court (not called Camelot) has also been located at Carlisle (frequently) and at Stirling (William Worcester); but none of these has any relevance for the period before the romances.<br>
<br>At about the same time as Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes was writing, the earliest French and German romances concerning Tristan appeared, those of B&eacute;roul, Eilhart von Oberg, and Thomas (<i>c</i>.1170&#150;1190). All three linked the legend peripherally with Arthur, portraying him as a powerful king in Britain. This connection is generally regarded as showing how the Arthurian cycle was attracting to itself other material, originally independent; but it is unknown whether earlier, unattested, legends of Tristan also linked him with Arthur.<br>
<br>Arthur's name could by now bear political significance. Geoffrey, duke of Brittany, was younger brother to Richard I and older brother to King John, and was married to Constance, daughter of the duke of Brittany; in 1187 his posthumous son was called Arthur. The choice of name exploited Arthur's literary fame as well as Breton national sentiment. In the words of William of Newburgh, &#145;Having long awaited a legendary Arthur, they now raise a real one&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, 1.235). Richard I adopted Arthur as his heir in preference to John; when John was suspected of putting Arthur to death in captivity in 1203 it was a cause for Brittany to swear vengeance against him. The resonances of Arthur's name were to be used again by King Henry VII.<br>
<br>About 1190, during rebuilding works after a fire, Glastonbury Abbey proclaimed the discovery of King Arthur's grave. This served a dual purpose, a financial one for the abbey in producing a source of potential income, and a political one for the English government in proclaiming, against Breton and Welsh national sentiment, Arthur's death, and furthermore his burial in England. There are two near-contemporary records, by Gerald of Wales (who gives two contradictory accounts) and Ralph of Coggeshall. The grave was in the churchyard, set unusually deep, and contained gigantic bones in an oaken coffin, which also contained a woman's body with golden hair; an inscribed leaden cross lay beneath the coffin. The bodies were reburied in the church. The inscription on the cross was variously reported; it was illustrated in Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1607 edition), and there reads &#145;Hic iacet sepultus inclitus rex Arturius in insula Avalonia&#146; (&#145;Here lies buried the famous king Arthur in the Isle of Avalon&#146;). In Gerald's version it also states that Arthur's second wife, Guinevere, was buried with him. The lettering on the cross, which resembles that on late-Saxon coins, probably represents a late twelfth-century idea of suitably antique lettering. The identification of Avalon with Glastonbury is probably no earlier than this discovery, although the abbey had previously claimed King Arthur (as well as St Patrick) as a benefactor. The cross is now lost, but its discovery had a curious sequel in the 1980s, when a former model maker claimed to have found it on the grounds of a reservoir at Enfield in Middlesex. There was some uncertainty whether his find was the original or a replica based upon Camden's illustration, but Enfield borough council nevertheless took legal action, claiming King Arthur's cross as its property; the finder, refusing to yield it up, was sent to prison.<h2>
<a name="ThematterofBritain"></a>The matter of Britain</h2>The popularity of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's romances, added to the success of Geoffrey of Monmouth's history, ensured the spread of Arthurian themes. The phrase the &#145;matter of Britain&#146;, signifying the cycle of Arthurian and associated literature, dates from this time; it appears first in a poem of Jean Bodel (late twelfth century), and is complementary to the &#145;matter of France&#146; (<i>chansons de geste</i> of Charlemagne and other French history) and the &#145;matter of Rome&#146; (tales of antiquity, primarily Troy and the Alexander legend). During the thirteenth century compositions, allusions, or translations appear in all the major languages of western Europe, including German, Old Norse, Italian, Spanish, and English. For the English-speaking world the first important development was Layamon's English version (<i>c</i>.1200) of Wace's <span class="italic">Roman de Brut</span>, notable as the earliest extant Arthurian material in English. Layamon followed Wace's story (and thus Geoffrey's) closely, but added a great deal of amplification of his own, particularly in the Arthurian section. He gave Arthur elvish guardians who endowed him with virtues, and an upbringing in Brittany; he developed the round table introduced by Wace, having it manufactured in Cornwall; he made Arthur himself more supernatural, but also more heroic and cruel, compared with Wace's figure; and he emphasized the prospect of Arthur's return, prophesied by Merlin, &#145;to help the English&#146;.<br>
<br>In the early thirteenth century, too, Arthurian verse romances appeared in German, related to the French ones. Apart from Eilhart von Oberg's <span class="italic">Tristrant</span>, the earliest are Hartmann von Aue's <span class="italic">Erec</span> and <span class="italic">Iwein</span>, Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's <span class="italic">Lanzelet</span>, and Wolfram von Eschenbach's <span class="italic">Parzifal</span>, all <i>c</i>.1190&#150;1200, closely followed by Gottfried von Strasburg's <span class="italic">Tristrant</span>. These were in the same vein as Chr&eacute;tien's romances, using the Arthurian court as a background for plots concentrating on individual heroes.<br>
<br>Subsequently the major development in French was the shift to prose, and the development of the anonymous vulgate cycle (<i>c</i>.1225), a series of linked prose romances. These were partly based on the earlier verse romances of Robert de Boron (<i>c</i>.1200), though only incomplete texts of the latter survive. In the vulgate cycle the Arthurian legend took its classic form, with virtually all the elements known later. Its elaboration arose from a desire to follow through, connect, and explain all the disparate stories and motifs which had by now arisen in the Arthurian legends. Themes found here for the first time are the sword in the stone, a test establishing Arthur's fitness to rule and his role as champion of Christianity; the obtaining of Arthur's sword Excalibur from the lake, and its return there after Arthur's final battle; and Mordred (as his name comes to be presented) as the illegitimate son of Arthur, through unwitting incest with his half-sister Morgause. (In Geoffrey of Monmouth's history Modred is simply Arthur's nephew.) It has been suggested that the sword-in-the-stone motif may be of oriental origin. Other themes which now became more prominent were the quest for the holy grail, Merlin's life story, and Guinevere's adulterous love for Lancelot&#151;the latter as a key element in the final war which culminated in Arthur's death. The quest for the grail, in particular, altered the balance of the legend, giving it an overtly mystical message and the theme of a moral campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to counter the creeping decadence of Arthur's court.<br>
<br>Another development of the thirteenth century was the use of richly illustrated manuscripts to transmit Arthurian romances, the illustrations themselves being an important part of the material. These are particularly associated with the vulgate cycle. The illustrators naturally tended to portray the knights, and their court, in contemporary fashion (as did the texts themselves), and these illustrations, with their colour, vigour, and heraldry, have provided the dominant image of King Arthur and his court to this day. The consequence has been a lasting imbalance between the late-medieval image of the king and the dark-age period when he is supposed to have been active.<h2>
<a name="Thelatemiddleages"></a>The late middle ages</h2>In the fourteenth century King Arthur's position in the world of letters was consolidated. King Edward I of England used Geoffrey of Monmouth's account of Arthur's conquests as a justification (1301) for his policy towards Scotland. Across Europe Arthur was celebrated as one of the &#145;Nine Worthies&#146; (three pagans, three Jews, and three Christians), and as such appeared as one of the nine statues erected in the town hall in Cologne <i>c</i>.1325, and in many other portrayals. Dante made passing references to the romances and could expect them to be understood; and King Edward III was greatly interested in the legend, fancying himself as King Arthur, organizing tournaments and planning a &#145;round table&#146; festival in 1344&#150;5. The wooden round table displayed at Winchester was made at some time between 1250 and 1350; whichever king was responsible, it indisputably demonstrates the royal adoption of the legend for political ends.<br>
<br>This was the period of the finest Arthurian literature in English, most notably <span class="italic">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>. Like Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's romances, this narrative poem consists of an adventure set at King Arthur's court, rather than a story of Arthur; but Arthur is not supine&#151;he is himself about to accept the Green Knight's challenge when Gawain asks to stand in for him. The theme of the reciprocal &#145;beheading challenge&#146; set by a magical being is found earlier in Irish legend; here it is successfully used for a courtly moral tale. Two fourteenth-century poems tell the story of Arthur's downfall. The <span class="italic">Stanzaic Morte Arthur</span> is based on the last part of the vulgate cycle but with original material; it relates Guinevere and Lancelot's adulterous love, the resultant strife at Arthur's court, Mordred's treachery, and Arthur's end. The <span class="italic">Alliterative Morte Arture</span> is closer to Geoffrey of Monmouth's account, with elaborations; Arthur is even offered the imperial crown after his successful campaign against Rome. Chaucer used Arthurian material to exemplify courtly behaviour, and gave his moral &#145;Wife of Bath's Tale&#146; an Arthurian setting. Boccaccio similarly used Arthurian themes for tales of love and to draw morals about the dangers of pride; he was evidently worried by the fabulous aspects and the doubtful historicity of the whole cycle. Similar doubts were felt by Ranulf Higden (<i>d</i>. 1364), who pointed out in his <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> (world history) that the lack of references to Arthur's European conquests in continental chronicles cast doubt on Geoffrey's account.<br>
<br>In the mid-fifteenth century, however, John Hardyng had no such doubts when he composed his verse chronicle of the kings of England, with a view to justifying the claims of kings Henry V and Henry VI to overlordship of Scotland. Hardyng followed very closely Geoffrey of Monmouth's scheme of events, including Arthur's conquests first in the British Isles and then abroad, but with two major differences: first, Arthur actually conquers Rome and is triumphantly crowned emperor there, and, second, Hardyng incorporated the quest for the holy grail into his narrative, with much attendant detail about the knights of the round table. Consequently Arthur is allotted substantially more space than any other king in this chronicle. At about the same time Henry Lovelich composed his <span class="italic">History of the Holy Grail</span> and <span class="italic">Merlin</span>. The former is a verse translation of that part of the vulgate cycle dealing with Joseph of Arimathea; Lovelich located his burial at Glastonbury Abbey, and stressed the line of guardians of the grail, descending to Arthur's time. Lovelich's <span class="italic">Merlin</span> was likewise a verse translation of the vulgate <span class="italic">Estoire de Merlin</span>, emphasizing the links of the grail with Merlin, and thus with Arthur.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Malory's work known as <span class="italic">Le Morte Darthur</span> (1469&#150;70; printed by Caxton in 1485; reprinted in 1498, 1529, etc.) is actually a comprehensive collection of Arthurian tales, echoing the scope of the vulgate cycle of 250 years earlier. The basic story is once more that of Geoffrey of Monmouth, but with the accretions of the intervening centuries, and also with attempts to reconcile the inevitable discrepancies. The main themes are the now-traditional ones of courtly valour vitiated by moral weakness, and (very relevantly) the terribleness of treachery and civil strife. Malory added little or nothing of his own, but emphasized Arthur's heroic dignity and grandeur, playing down the image of the <i>roi fain&eacute;ant</i>. The power of his narrative gave it an enduring influence in English literature, while at the same time setting up an enduring contrast between the &#145;literary&#146; image of Arthur, as exemplified by Malory himself, and a &#145;historical&#146; one represented, however spuriously, by Geoffrey of Monmouth. However, the credibility which this dichotomy implicitly conceded to Geoffrey's account was still limited in many eyes.<br>
<br>Stories of King Arthur, some derived from medieval romances, continued to circulate in anonymous ballads, of which the earliest may date from the fifteenth century; there is also a Middle Scots stanzaic poem <span class="italic">Golagros and Gawane</span> (1508), in which Gawain's graciousness twice saves Arthur's court from disgrace. Some Arthurian ballads survived in circulation until the modern period. In 1486 King Henry VII gave the name Arthur to his eldest son, thereby both ingratiating himself to the Welsh and boosting his own position as ruler of England and Wales. King Henry was following the precedent set by Geoffrey of Brittany 300 years earlier; and King Arthur was claimed as an ancestor by first the Tudor and consequently the Stuart lines to vindicate their claims to the throne.<h2>
<a name="Thesixteenthtoeighteenthcenturies"></a>The sixteenth to eighteenth centuries</h2>The chief interest of the Arthurian legend in the Renaissance was as an object of antiquarian study. The interest followed two main strands, scholarly investigation into the historicity of Arthur, and his political use as an antecedent of the Tudor dynasty, whose Welsh descent was stressed partly in order to assert the historical unity of England and Wales. The romantic dimensions of the legend were less emphasized, and Arthur's empire-building activities, as claimed by Geoffrey of Monmouth, became his most significant attribute. This political use continued through Queen Elizabeth's reign into the seventeenth century, when King James I wished to establish his dynastic continuity from the Tudors. Geoffrey's inclusion of Ireland in Arthur's imperial conquests was particularly appreciated, and John Dee, Queen Elizabeth's astrologer, in his <span class="italic">Perfect Arte of Navigation</span> (1577), argued that Arthur had established a &#145;British empire&#146; abroad.<br>
<br>The earliest example of an antiquarian investigator is probably William Worcester, in 1477&#150;80, who naturally knew Geoffrey of Monmouth's history, but also reported items of local interest around the country. The Italian Polydore Vergil, resident in England, wrote his <span class="italic">Anglica Historia</span> about 1506&#150;13, at the end of King Henry VII's and the beginning of Henry VIII's reigns; Polydore impugned the veracity of Geoffrey's history and doubted the importance of Arthur. John Leland vigorously defended Arthur against this attack in his <span class="italic">Assertio inclytissimi Arturii, regis Britanniae</span> (1544), dedicated to King Henry VIII. Leland solved the problem of Gildas's silence over Arthur by postulating lost works which did mention him (just as Gerald of Wales had done, two and a half centuries earlier), and by abusing Gildas as an evasive rogue (as modern scholars have done); Leland's defence also contains probably the earliest instance of the use of folklore as an argument, for he adduces the frequency of Arthurian sites in Britain as evidence for the king's activities. Leland also knew King Arthur's charter of confirmation to the University of Cambridge, dated 7 April 531; it was printed in 1608 by Brian Twyne, an Oxford man who had the temerity to suggest that Leland might have fabricated it. Henry VIII was himself responsible for the repainting of the round table at Winchester, incorporating a portrait of himself as King Arthur. (The memory of his older brother may have played a part in this conceit.) Antiquarian interest was greatly boosted by Drayton's <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span> (1612), which drew (as always) on Geoffrey's history, and reported topographical associations of Arthur in many parts of Britain.<br>
<br>Of more overtly literary works, Ariosto's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span>, from the beginning of the sixteenth century, is concerned with the matter of France rather than the matter of Britain, although Arthur makes a fleeting appearance as an adjunct to the more prominent Merlin. At the end of the century Spenser, in his unfinished <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>, made his &#145;Prince Arthur&#146; a prefiguration of Queen Elizabeth; by recounting Arthur's career before he became king, Spenser gained the historical resonances of the character while retaining the freedom to create new adventures for him, whereby he becomes perfected in the moral virtues: Arthur's person was used to represent the virtue &#145;magnificence&#146; or &#145;magnanimity&#146;, which encapsulated striving for all the other virtues. Spenser's story hence has little in common with the traditional legend; none of the knights named by Malory is mentioned, apart from Sir Tristram. Like other writers of the period, Spenser had to find a balance between wishful myth making and dutiful scepticism.<br>
<br>The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a low point of Arthurian literary activity. Partly this was due to the spirit of the age, out of sympathy with what it regarded as crude medieval literature and institutions. But there was also an inherent contradiction for Englishmen in celebrating Arthur as a national hero, for the &#145;historical&#146; element of the Arthurian legend rejoiced in his successful opposition to the English. Ben Jonson, Milton, and Dryden all contemplated writing Arthurian epics, but none achieved them. In Milton's case the identification of King Arthur with the royalist, Stuart, cause was probably a significant factor in his change of mind; likewise his growing interest in Saxon culture as an alternative to Anglo-Norman. Dryden's operatic libretto, <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (1684&#150;91), set by Purcell, owes very little to earlier works in its portrayal of the hero. Even here King Arthur is portrayed as a defender of both Christianity and British independence against the pagan Saxons; but the break with tradition is manifested in the prominent role which Arthur himself plays in the action, fighting in single combat against the Saxon Oswald to win Emmeline, the blind daughter of the duke of Cornwall. The anti-English aspect of the legend was resolved by anticipating, &#145;Britons and Saxons shall be once one people &hellip; in a perpetual peace&#146;  (Merlin, in act <span class="smallcap">V</span>, scene ii). Shortly afterwards Richard Blackmore's two epic poems, <span class="italic">Prince Arthur</span> (1695) and <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (1697), allegories about William of Orange, owed little to previous accounts, though claiming Geoffrey of Monmouth as their primary source; they were notable mainly for the contempt heaped upon them.<br>
<br>Compared with Spenser, Blackmore was hampered by (among other factors) the increasing tenuousness of any claimed link between the British hero and the current reigning dynasty. This disadvantage may have contributed to Arthur's lesser popularity as a literary figure in the eighteenth century; there are few works of note apart from ballads. Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Tom Thumb, a Tragedy</span> (1730&#150;31; set as an opera by Thomas Arne, 1733) has only the name of King Arthur himself (and its burlesque of Dryden, among others) to make it an Arthurian work; his presence is due to Fielding's use of the nursery tale which placed Tom Thumb in &#145;the days of king Arthur&#146; as a shorthand for &#145;olden times&#146;. William Hilton's play, <span class="italic">Arthur, Monarch of the Britons</span> (written in 1759; published in <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of William Hilton</span>, 1775&#150;6), is a patriotic piece based (directly or otherwise) on Geoffrey of Monmouth's account, which had become accessible in its first English translation by Aaron Thompson in 1718. Hilton dealt with the anti-English orientation of the Arthurian legend by having the Saxon enemy look forward to the time when the English, having conquered the British, would themselves &#145;into Britons grow&#146;, and the dying Arthur himself maintain, &#145;Britons must be free&#146; as his aspiration  (pp. 239, 247). John Whitaker's <span class="italic">History of Manchester</span> (1771&#150;5) was an early example of the investigation of the &#145;historical&#146; Arthur by local historians and topographers; it is notable for Whitaker's attempt to identify the sites of Arthur's twelve battles listed in the <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, and for Dr Johnson's comment upon the work as a whole, &#145;all a dream&#146;  (J. Boswell, <span class="italic">The Life of Samuel Johnson</span>, 1791, under 29 April 1778). Thomas Warton, professor of poetry at Oxford, combined his interests by writing poems on local Arthurian themes, notably &#145;The Grave of King Arthur&#146; (1777), which used the Glastonbury discovery to emphasize Arthur's historical death. William Blake took surprisingly little direct interest in the Arthurian legend, though he did write four lines of a &#145;Merlin's Prophecy&#146; (<i>c</i>.1793), and in an exhibition of 1809 he portrayed Arthur opposing the Romans rather than the Anglo-Saxons, no doubt for reasons of English sentiment. (Geoffrey of Monmouth's Arthur had done both, of course.)<h2>
<a name="Thenineteenthcenturyandopera"></a>The nineteenth century and opera</h2>The enormous growth of interest in the middle ages during the nineteenth century has been thoroughly studied. During this period King Arthur became established, apparently permanently, as a national hero, despite suffering (as always) from the twin disadvantages of having opposed the English, and of his opposition having failed in the long term; even though these two disadvantages might appear to cancel each other out, they have failed to do so, because Arthur's adoption as a national British hero required some overlooking of the original ethnic identities in the story.<br>
<br>Before the 1830s, apart from now-forgotten works such as John Thelwall's play, <span class="italic">The Fairy of the Lake</span> (1801), set in Wales, the most notable developments were the republication of Malory's <span class="italic">Morte Darthur</span> (three editions in 1816&#150;17, after a gap of nearly 200 years), and the interest of Sir Walter Scott, as part of his wider medieval enthusiasm. Although Scott wrote little specifically about King Arthur, he made allusive references to Arthurian stories in his <span class="italic">Marmion</span> (1808), precociously citing Malory (among other medieval material) in his notes; and in his verse romance, <span class="italic">The Bridal of Triermain</span> (1813; set as an operetta by J. L. Ellerton in 1831), a quasi-ancient lay is recited, in which Arthur and Guinevere display a rather casual attitude to marital fidelity.<br>
<br>From the 1830s onwards Alfred Tennyson dominated the Arthurian revival, even though, to begin with, he followed the public interest as much as he shaped it. Of his earliest published Arthurian poems, written in 1830&#150;34, only &#145;Morte d'Arthur&#146; (published in 1842) dealt with Arthur himself. These poems already displayed Tennyson's later emphases within the legend, namely Arthur as the ideal king, chastity, and the holy grail, and the social destructiveness of Guinevere's infidelity. Tennyson returned to the legend in the 1850s, notably with the first four of the <span class="italic">Idylls of the King</span>, published in 1859; he added further poems to that cycle in the 1870s, and continued to concern himself with Arthurian themes until his death. Tennyson depended heavily upon Malory's <span class="italic">Morte Darthur</span>, and produced the first significant retelling in modern times of substantial parts of the Arthurian story; his particular interest was in the high ideals of Arthur's court, and their decay due to moral frailty and human evil. He was less interested in the empire-building aspect of Arthur's activities. Tennyson portrayed sympathetically the feelings of the women in the stories; but his portrait of Arthur himself has been criticized, like those of so many others, for lacking depth. Once again Arthur was primarily a symbol for the events and ideals around him.<br>
<br>Tennyson's moralistic interpretation of the legend was not the only attitude current at this time. Edward Bulwer-Lytton's epic poem <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (1848) resolved the problem of Arthur's necessary opposition to the English by making him the architect of political freedom (as in Hilton's play, ninety years earlier), and that of Guinevere's adultery by dividing her into two, Arthur's queen, Genevieve, and Lancelot's wife, Genevra; the action of the poem reflected contemporary activities of global exploration and empire building, and is rich in comic detail (some of it probably intentional), including the well-known episode in the Arctic, where Arthur is saved by a band of Eskimos from becoming trapped in the ice. In the 1850s both Matthew Arnold (&#145;Tristram and Iseult&#146;, 1852) and William Morris (<span class="italic">The Defence of Guinevere</span>, 1858) took a notably liberal attitude to the adultery inherent in some of the legends; likewise Algernon Swinburne, who, like Arnold, was more interested in the Tristan legend than in Arthur himself. But on the popular level, J. T. Knowles's <span class="italic">The Story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table</span> (1862), in retelling Malory for boys, adhered to Tennyson's rigorous morality: the work was dedicated to Tennyson, and in that spirit Knowles acknowledged suppressing and modifying elements of Malory's story, where changed manners and morals &#145;have made it absolutely necessary to do so&#146;  (p. iii).<br>
<br>The growing enthusiasm for Arthurian topics ensured that the legend circulated widely in British cultural life during the later nineteenth century; Queen Victoria's seventh child (and third son), born in 1850, was baptized Arthur. Tennyson's success inspired subsequent authors and artists to draw their themes from Malory. William Dyce's frescoes in Westminster Palace (1849&#150;62) showed the establishment view of the Arthurian legend as embodying British chivalry. By contrast, the Pre-Raphaelites preferred the sensual and emotive aspects of the stories. Dante Gabriel Rossetti illustrated Tennyson's poems in 1857, and in the same year began a set of murals for the Oxford Union, collaborating with William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and others. The scenes were again taken from Malory. In North America Mark Twain's bitter <span class="italic">A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur</span> (1889) satirized Malory's Arthur, portraying the king as obtuse, and showing an equal hatred for medieval and modern society.<br>
<br>Scholarly interest in the nineteenth century paid attention to two aspects in particular: the enduring debate concerning Arthur's historicity, and a new interest in the origins and literary development of the legend. Among historians, Joseph Ritson's posthumously published <span class="italic">Life of King Arthur</span> (1825) is notable for its advanced attitude to the sources. Ritson vigorously asserted the untrustworthy nature of Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Brittaniae</span> (&#145;a series of palpable and monstrous lies&#146;; p. xviii), but placed faith in the ninth-century <span class="italic">Historia Brittonum</span>, while recognizing the unsatisfactory state of the text in its varying recensions. Modern scholars would also agree with his wariness towards Welsh literary allusions, because of the lateness of the manuscripts. Two historical works, both first published in 1848, demonstrate how the debate on Arthur's historicity has continued unchanged, before and since: Macaulay affirms, in his <span class="italic">History of England</span>, &#145;Arthur and Mordred are mythical persons, whose very existence may be questioned&#146;  (chap. 1); whereas Thomas Miller's popular <span class="italic">History of the Anglo-Saxons</span> argues, &#145;there cannot be a doubt about the existence of king Arthur&#146;  (3rd edn, 1856, 82). The increased ease of travel during the nineteenth century, and the consequent profusion of tourists' guidebooks, meant wider availability, and more detailed documentation, of Arthurian landmarks and other local folklore.<br>
<br>On the literary side of scholarship, the publication of Lady Charlotte Guest's English translation of the <span class="italic">Mabinogion</span> (1838&#150;49) raised implicitly the question of priority between Britain and France in early Arthurian narratives; and the debate could be widened, according to taste, to embrace the possibility of mythological antecedents. Jessie Weston's books (1894&#150;1920) were particularly influential; her last work, <span class="italic">From Ritual to Romance</span> (1920), argued that the original theme of the holy grail legend was the task of healing the Fisher King (the wounded keeper of the grail) and the removal of the curse from the Waste Land; her interpretation provided inspiration for T. S. Eliot, but Arthur himself had become irrelevant.<br>
<br>In opera, the Arthurian legend has not generally provided successful themes; perhaps the matter of Britain was too weighty to make satisfactory plots. Richard Wagner had been interested in Arthurian legends since 1850, and in medieval literature generally from even earlier; but his three &#145;Arthurian&#146; operas are so only in the derivation of their material. <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> (1882) both recount legends of the holy grail (<span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> very peripherally so, <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> using Wolfram von Eschenbach's romance), while <span class="italic">Tristan</span> (1865) used Gottfried von Strasburg's poem, with Wagner's own ending. King Arthur's retreat into the background can go no further than in these works, which are undeniably &#145;Arthurian&#146; in origin, yet in which the king himself plays no role, and is not even mentioned. In these works the legends of Tristan and the holy grail have effectively escaped from their Arthurian context, and become independent stories.<br>
<br>Truly Arthurian operas of note, since Purcell's, have been rare. <span class="italic">Le roi Artus</span>, by the French composer Ernest Chausson, was first performed in 1903, four years after his death; it concentrates on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, including Guinevere's suicide, Lancelot's death in battle, and Arthur's final removal to immortality across the sea. The Englishman Rutland Boughton (<i>d</i>. 1960), emulating Wagner, composed a grand cycle of five operas telling the whole Arthurian story (1909&#150;44), but only three were performed and they remain unpublished. They were envisaged as &#145;a work which achieves what Wagner failed thoroughly to achieve&#146;, and were intended to be performed at Glastonbury in a &#145;temple theatre&#146;, the focal point of a religious commune  (Boughton and Buckley). The librettos of the first two (<span class="italic">The Birth of Arthur</span>, earlier called <span class="italic">Uther and Igraine</span>, and <span class="italic">The Round Table</span>) were written in collaboration with Reginald Buckley, and those of the last three (<span class="italic">The Lily Maid</span>, concerning Lancelot and Elaine, <span class="italic">Galahad</span>, and <span class="italic">Avalon</span>) by Boughton alone. They promote Boughton's message of Christian socialism, with all magic edited out: the sword in the stone is a mechanical trick solved by Arthur, Lancelot is a fascist, and Arthur dies with no suggestion of a return, but consoled by the peasants' revolutionary song which closes the cycle. Boughton's opera <span class="italic">The Queen of Cornwall</span> (1924), based on Thomas Hardy's folk-play of the Tristan legend, <span class="italic">The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall</span> (1923), was more successful, though Arthur himself was again dispensed with. Harrison Birtwistle's opera <span class="italic">Gawain</span> (1991; libretto by David Harsent) was closely based on <span class="italic">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>, interpreting the poem to portray Arthur as suffering from ennui, and Gawain's momentary lapse from the highest moral standards as a victory for Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, over Arthur's court.<h2>
<a name="Twentiethcenturyliteratureandfilm"></a>Twentieth-century literature and film</h2>In the course of the twentieth century the nineteenth-century river of Arthurian material became a flood. Arthurian literature continues in full spate, boosted by the even wider interest in &#145;sword-and-sorcery&#146; literature following upon the popularity of J. R. R. Tolkien's <span class="italic">The Lord of the Rings</span> (which does not obviously include Arthurian themes among its many sources, despite Tolkien's having co-edited <span class="italic">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>). Since the 1960s the association of anything perceived as &#145;Celtic&#146; with &#145;new-age&#146; alternative culture has also given Arthurian materials a fresh vogue and created a link with vague spirituality. In the conflict whether to locate the Arthurian material in the dark ages (where it is believed to belong historically) or in the late middle ages (whence all its literary iconography and manners are derived), the earlier setting has tended to replace the later as the preferred background.<br>
<br>Only a few out of many works can be mentioned here. J. C. Powys wrote three novels touching on Arthurian themes, <span class="italic">A Glastonbury Romance</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Morwyn</span> (1937, Arthurian only in that Merlin appears), and <span class="italic">Porius</span> (1951). They are vehicles for Powys's views on love and sexuality, science, and religion. In <span class="italic">Porius</span> the Arthurian world is seen as one of conflict between Christianity and paganism, though not the paganism of the Saxons, as traditionally, but what is envisaged as a pre-Christian Celtic religion. The well-researched and well-produced comic strip cartoon <span class="italic">Prince Valiant</span>, written by Hal Foster in 1937&#150;71 and still continuing, uses a non-traditional knight of King Arthur's court (the eponymous hero) for an outrageously varied series of adventures involving vikings, Huns, crusades, and the discovery of America; a film based on it was made in 1954.<br>
<br>T. H. White's tetralogy, <span class="italic">The Once and Future King</span> (1938&#150;58), offers an ever-fresh retelling based on Malory but with much of White's own invention, and with comic episodes as well as tragedy; it inspired both the musical <span class="italic">Camelot</span> (Lerner and Loewe, 1960; film version, 1967) and the Disney cartoon-film, <span class="italic">The Sword in the Stone</span> (1963). White's was one of the last reworkings to be content with late-medieval courtliness as a background: more recently an awareness of academic work on the subject, and the desire for &#145;realism&#146; (or at least historical plausibility) has caused almost all authors to choose a fifth- or sixth-century setting. In many cases that has meant linking the events with the earlier end of Roman Britain, by a process of historical telescoping.<br>
<br>The poet Charles Williams published two overlapping series of poems on Arthurian themes, <span class="italic">Taliessin through Logres</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">The Region of the Summer Stars</span> (1944); they cover the whole sweep of Arthurian legend, but have particular interest in the holy grail and the conflicts which prevented its attainment. The obscurity of the poems was partly elucidated by C. S. Lewis, in <span class="italic">Arthurian Torso</span> (1948). Lewis was also perhaps the first to bring the Arthurian world into conjunction with science fiction. In the third of his space trilogy, <span class="italic">That Hideous Strength</span> (1945), he uses both Merlin and the grail legend in a modern university setting for an apocalyptic allegory showing the dangers of science without morals. The blend of Arthurian with futuristic themes has since proved endlessly productive.<br>
<br>Rosemary Sutcliff's six novels (1959&#150;81) are varied in their approaches, some (more for children) following Malory, but one (<span class="italic">Sword at Sunset</span>, 1963) being told by Arthur in the first person. Sutcliff here followed historical plausibility in placing her Arthur firmly in the post-Roman period, away from any trace of late-medieval chivalry; and this setting has been chosen for virtually all Arthurian novels since her time. Dark-age realism has replaced courtly pageantry. Mary Stewart's four novels (1970&#150;84), deservedly successful, similarly have a dark-age setting; the story is that of Geoffrey of Monmouth rather than Malory. The narrative is told from Merlin's and, in the last, from Modred's point of view, though not at the expense of sympathy for Arthur. M. Z. Bradley's popular <span class="italic">The Mists of Avalon</span> (1982) takes a feminist stance, portraying Arthur's world as one of conflict between Christianity and Celtic paganism, the latter identified as the women's religion. The Arthurian legend has also been frequently reinterpreted in children's literature. Roger Lancelyn Green's <span class="italic">King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table</span> (1953) successfully retells the stories of Malory and others, while Susan Cooper's <span class="italic">The Dark is Rising</span> series of five novels (1965&#150;77) powerfully combines the Arthurian legend with a modern struggle of good and evil.<br>
<br>The choice of setting between late-medieval chivalry and dark-age mud and brutality is even more acute in film than in literature, because of the need to choose a mode of visual representation. As in literature, producers in the earlier part of the century tended to choose a late-medieval setting, while more recent films have preferred the supposed authenticity of the dark age. The earliest recorded Arthurian film is the silent <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> (Edwin Porter, 1904), based on Wagner's opera, and thus only marginally Arthurian; the earliest truly Arthurian film is therefore <span class="italic">Lancelot and Elaine</span> (Charles Kent, 1909), based on Tennyson's poem of that name, part of his <span class="italic">Idylls of the King</span>. There were several early versions of Twain's <span class="italic">Connecticut Yankee</span> (1921, 1931, and 1949), all emphasizing its comical rather than its bitter aspects. Various films of the 1940s and 1950s, notably <span class="italic">The Adventures of Sir Galahad</span> (Spencer Bennet, 1949), <span class="italic">Prince Valiant</span> (Henry Hathaway, 1954), and <span class="italic">The Black Knight</span> (Tay Garnett, 1954) used King Arthur's court as a setting for newly composed adventures, much as Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes and his successors had done; these were on the whole more successful than films which reverently followed the established plots, such as <span class="italic">Knights of the Round Table</span> (Richard Thorpe, 1953), an ambitious attempt to tell the whole Arthurian story, drawing again on Malory with simplifications, and emphasizing the desirability of constitutional law over autocracy. Most were late-medieval and chivalric in their atmosphere and setting.<br>
<br>During the 1970s directors began to use settings more resembling the dark age. <span class="italic">Gawain and the Green Knight</span> (Stephen Weeks, 1973) was unusual in being based on a single medieval text, and in being comfortable with the mystery of medieval romance. John Boorman's popular <span class="italic">Excalibur</span> (1981) is one of the more successful attempts to portray the whole story, though dwelling unnecessarily on the violent aspects. French films continued to prefer a late-medieval atmosphere, perhaps for its greater photogenic qualities. The sombre <span class="italic">Lancelot du lac</span> (Robert Bresson, 1974) portrays the romance of Lancelot and Guinevere and its undermining of the courtly ideals, while <span class="italic">Perceval le Gallois</span> (Eric Rohmer, 1978) follows Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes's romance quite closely; it tackled the problem of setting by using artificial sets designed after late-medieval manuscript illuminations, together with medieval music.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</span> (Gilliam and Jones, 1975) is the best-informed of medieval films, and the most influential Arthurian one. It parodies both Arthurian literature and films portraying the middle ages, making serious as well as amusing points, including the vacuous bloodthirstiness of some episodes in medieval romance and the quaintness of medieval syllogisms to modern ears. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the spate of films and novels, and likewise of books claiming to identify the &#145;historical&#146; Arthur, shows no sign of abating. Helped, no doubt, by the absence of hard facts to constrain the imagination, the continuing vitality of the legend bears ample witness to the richness and variety of the material comprised in the &#145;matter of Britain&#146;.<br>
