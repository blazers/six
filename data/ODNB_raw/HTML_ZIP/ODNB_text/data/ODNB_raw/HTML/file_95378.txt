<span class="headword">Williams,  Egbert Austin <span class="st"> [Bert]</span></span>  (1874&#150;1922), <span class="occ">dancer and entertainer</span>, was born on 12 November 1874 in St Matthew's parish, Nassau, Bahamas, the son of Frederick Williams (1850&#150;1912), then working as a waiter at the Royal Victoria Hotel, Nassau, and his Antigua-born wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Monceur. He had one sister. The family migrated to Florida about 1885, and soon moved to San Pedro, California, and finally to Riverside, California, where Bert attended school. He planned to study civil engineering at Stanford University, but instead worked as an entertainer in San Francisco, where in 1893 he met George Walker (1873&#150;1911), with whom he formed a double act, Walker and Williams, the Two Real Coons, appearing in minstrel and medicine shows and then vaudeville. By 1896 the pair were in New York, formed a short-lived all-black theatrical company, and then with better management took leading roles in several shows including <span class="italic">The Policy Players</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">Sons of Ham</span> (1900). In 1900 Williams married Charlotte Louise Johnson; they had no children.<br>
<br>Williams and Walker had first visited England in April 1897, but they were not well received and their run at the Empire Theatre lasted only a week (which Williams put down to their appearance straight after the ballet <span class="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>). Nevertheless, the success of their all-black musical comedy <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span>, which was premiered on Broadway in February 1903, persuaded them to return to England, sailing with their forty-strong cast at the end of April. <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> was premiered in London at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 16 May 1903, and was an instant sensation. British press reports acknowledged that <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> was unlike any previous musical show to play in London. The <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> noted that the audience &#145;literally screamed with merriment over the whimsicalities of a tall low comedian named Williams. He upset the gravity of everybody, and the preservation of a rigid and decorous countenance became absolutely impossible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 18 May 1903). It also ventured that the show's &#145;natural dash and swing and the humours of the ineffable Williams will, no doubt, endorse the favourable verdict emphatically pronounced on Saturday night&#146;  (ibid.). Its only criticism, if it was one, was that even the programme notes did not clarify what the show was about. The abrupt ending was reported by the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span> (18 May 1903) as &#145;wildly inconsequential&#146; and <span class="italic">The Times</span> (18 May 1903) said the show was an example of plotless drama perhaps without rival. The <span class="italic">Sunday Sun</span>'s report (17 May 1903) noted that the success of the show depended on Williams and Walker, who &#145;are both excellent comedians, than whom it would be difficult to find any better on the London stage&#146;. Of Williams <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed that &#145;he possesses the gift of stringing together tunes of a decidedly taking kind&#146;. The <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> reviewer, also baffled by the absence of a plot and noting that the audience remained seated for some time after the finale, praised Williams's<blockquote>extraordinarily amusing impersonation of the part of Shylock Homestead. For this alone the work deserves to score a great popular success. He is, from every point of view, admirable; his art is so personal and so elusive that it is difficult to analyze it; but his methods are absolutely alive with the possibilities of laughter. (18 May 1903)</blockquote>The British expected these black Americans to dance the cakewalk, and by late May that dance was in the show. By late June a cake over 6 feet high, lit by 100 electric light bulbs, was central to the dance. This was such a success that it was frequently thereafter asserted, erroneously, that <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> introduced that dance to Britain. A royal command performance was given on 23 June 1903 at Buckingham Palace for the ninth birthday of Edward VII's favourite grandson, David (the future Edward VIII), and the cakewalk was taught to society grandees by Williams and Walker. The show added extra performances for the Christmas period (the 250th performance was on 26 December), but as the Shaftesbury Theatre was to be redecorated in the new year the show moved off to other British cities, including Manchester, Newcastle, and Glasgow. In Edinburgh Williams and other male entertainers joined the Freemasons.<br>
<br>Williams and the <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> troupe made a lasting impression on many British residents of African birth or descent, including the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Until the <span class="italic">Blackbirds</span> shows set a new standard in the 1920s, many black entertainers claimed to have been in the show, for it was a benchmark in British theatre. Other Britons remained enamoured of Williams, whose comic style led George Bernard Shaw to express the wish that he should take the role of Ftatateeta, the queen's nurse in his <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> (first performed in 1906).<br>
<br>Williams and most of the <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> troupe sailed from Liverpool for New York on 14 June 1904, and new recruits arrived to take their places. Stella Hart, who had worked with Williams in <span class="italic">The Policy Players</span>, joined the <span class="italic">In Dahomey</span> players in July 1904 and when interviewed by <span class="italic">The Magnet</span> of Leeds (12 November 1904) said they intended to continue touring Britain for two years. But without Williams and Walker the show could not survive.<br>
<br>Back in America Williams worked with Walker until the latter's retirement in 1909, and then became the leading black figure in American entertainment. Among his fans was the educationist Booker T. Washington, who described him as<blockquote>a tremendous asset of the Negro race. He is an asset because he has succeeded in actually doing something, and because he has succeeded, the fact of his success helps the Negro many times more than he could help the Negro by merely contenting himself to whine and complain about racial difficulties and racial discriminations. (&#145;The greatest comedian the negro race has&#146;, <span class="italic">American Magazine</span>, 70, Sept 1910, 601)</blockquote>Williams wrote over seventy songs, made gramophone recordings from 1901, and directed and starred in the film <span class="italic">Natural Born Gambler</span> (1916), thus becoming the first known black American film director. Florenz Ziegfeld employed him in his <span class="italic">Follies</span>, a Broadway attraction, from 1910 to 1919. He was a great success, but by moving into white musical comedy he deprived black theatre of a major figure. He collapsed in Detroit on 28 February 1922 and died in New York on 4 March. One of those at his Harlem funeral was the South African nationalist Solomon Plaatje; both Edward &#145;Duke&#146; Ellington and Ferdinand &#145;Jelly Roll&#146; Morton later composed works named for him.<br>
