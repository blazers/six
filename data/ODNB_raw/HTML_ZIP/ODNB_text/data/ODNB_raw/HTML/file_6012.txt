<span class="headword">Colville,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was from Cleish, Kinross-shire, and was the brother of Sir Robert Colville of Cleish. He appears to have graduated MA from St Andrews University in 1631 and was ordained to the ministry and appointed to his first charge at Cramond, near Edinburgh, in 1635. Shortly after the covenanting revolution he was translated to Trinity College, Edinburgh, to which he was presented by the town council of Edinburgh on 14 January 1639 and admitted soon after. Colville was chosen to act in the capacity of emissary from the covenanting regime to the United Provinces and to Louis XIII of France. In particular he was entrusted with soliciting Dutch and French backing against Charles I and his royalist followers. In 1641 he took part in church discussions designed to end the controversy over private meetings for worship. He was translated to and inducted as pastor of the Tron Kirk, Edinburgh, in December that same year.<br>
<br>Colville's defence of the engagement led to his suspension from the ministry by the general assembly in July 1648 and deposition on 26 July 1649. He left Scotland and was soon called to the ministry of an English congregation in Utrecht. Not bereft of admirers in the Scottish capital, in April 1652 he was chosen by the town council to be principal of Edinburgh University. However, his appointment was opposed by the ministry and was vetoed by the protectorate government in Scotland. On 8 November 1654 the synod of Lothian restored him to the ministry and the following year he was admitted to the charge of Perth.<br>
<br>Colville remained at Perth until, in 1662, he was appointed principal of Edinburgh University. As principal he is best remembered for initiating a series of administrative and legislative articles designed to improve student discipline and facilitate learning. He was the author of <span class="italic">Refreshing Streams</span> (1655), <span class="italic">Ethicam Christianam</span> (1670), and <span class="italic">The Righteous Branch</span> (1673). His pamphlet, &#145;Submission to the censures of suspension and deposition exemplified in the case of the Very Reverend Mr William Colvill, sometime one of the ministers of Edinburgh, and afterwards principal of the college there. From authentic and unquestionable vouchers&#146;, was published posthumously in 1734. Colville was married twice, first to Marion Brisbane, with whom he had four sons and a daughter, and second to Marion Fyfe, with whom he had a son. He probably died in Edinburgh in late May 1675, for he was buried there on 3 June.<br>
