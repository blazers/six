<span class="headword">Browne,  (Elliott) Martin</span>  (1900&#150;1980), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born at Zeals House, Zeals, Wiltshire, on 29 January 1900, the third son of Colonel Percival John Browne and his wife, Bernarda Gracia <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lees. He was educated at Eton College, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took seconds in modern history (1921) and theology (1923). On graduating from Oxford he was appointed by Kent county council to be religious drama adviser for that county. On 20 December 1924 he married the actress Henzie Raeburn 
    (Henzie Helena Flesch; 1896&#150;1973)
  , the daughter of Henry Charles Flesch, insurance broker. They had two sons. She supported his work and appeared in many of his productions. From 1924 to 1926 he was warden of an educational settlement in Doncaster. In 1927 he made a brief appearance in a Stage Society production at the Regent Theatre in London and immediately afterwards went to the United States as assistant professor of drama at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh. For the following three years he played in various local &#145;stock&#146; companies.<br>
<br>Back in England in 1930 Browne was appointed by George Bell, bishop of Chichester, to be director of religious drama for the diocese. One of Browne's early assignments was to organize a pageant, &#145;The Rock&#146;, to raise funds for the building of Anglican churches in the expanding suburbs of London. Through the good offices of Bishop Bell, T. S. Eliot was persuaded to write a series of choruses linking the loosely historical scenes of the pageant, which was played by amateurs and presented at Sadler's Wells Theatre from 28 May to 9 June 1934. On the strength of it, Bell invited Eliot and Browne to collaborate on a play to be presented at the Canterbury festival the following year. The text was to be written by Eliot and the production to be directed by Browne. Eliot gave to the play the title &#145;Fear in the way&#146; but during rehearsals the title was changed. Some say the change was suggested by Henzie Raeburn, others that it was suggested by Bernard Shaw. (The former seems the more likely candidate, in the circumstances.) The new title was <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span> and it was this production that established a working relationship of twenty years between Eliot as poet-playwright and Martin Browne as director. This first production of <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, with Robert Speaight as Becket, was staged in the chapter house (not in the cathedral itself) at Canterbury and was then taken to London, where it ran, astonishingly, for almost a year. It established Browne as the high priest of the then renascent &#145;poetic drama&#146; movement. In February 1938, at the Ritz Theatre in New York, he directed the first American production of <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, playing the part of Fourth Tempter himself with Henzie Raeburn as the Chorus Leader.<br>
<br>In March 1939 Browne directed Eliot's second play, <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span>, in London and in the same year, in association with the Arts Council, he launched a touring company which he called the Pilgrim Players (not to be confused with an earlier company&#151;1906 to 1911&#151;of the same name, run by Barry Jackson and John Drinkwater). The programme of Martin Browne's pilgrims, described in Henzie Raeburn's book, <span class="italic">Pilgrim Story</span> (1945), was dominated by the plays of Eliot and&#151;to a lesser degree&#151;of James Bridie (O. H. Mavor), the Scottish dramatist of rising reputation at that time. These tours continued until 1948.<br>
<br>Immediately after the Second World War, Browne took over the tiny Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill Gate and devoted it for the next three years entirely to the production of modern verse plays: first productions of plays by Christopher Fry, Ronald Duncan, Norman Nicholson, Anne Ridler, and Gilbert Horobin were staged, all directed by Martin Browne himself, together with revivals of already known plays by Bridie, Eliot, and others.<br>
<br>From 1948 to 1957 Browne was the director of the British Drama League, an organization devoted to giving assistance to the work of serious-minded amateur theatres. In 1951 he was responsible for the revival&#151;the first since 1572&#151;of the medieval cycle of York mystery plays, which he himself directed in the ruins of St Mary's Abbey, York, for the York festival (and in the year of the Festival of Britain). He repeated the production of the cycle at York in 1954, 1957, and 1966. Alongside these various activities in those years he continued his collaboration with T. S. Eliot, directing <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span> in 1949, <span class="italic">The Confidential Clerk</span> in 1953, and <span class="italic">The Elder Statesman</span> in 1958. And in 1969 he published <span class="italic">The Making of T. S. Eliot's Plays</span>. Various studies have pointed to Eliot's debt to Browne (for example F. B. Pinion, <span class="italic">A T. S. Eliot Companion</span>, 1986, and D. E. Jones, <span class="italic">The Plays of T. S. Eliot</span>, 1960).<br>
<br>For six months of each year from 1956 to 1962 Martin Browne served as visiting professor of religious drama at Union Theological College, New York, and from 1962 to 1965 he was drama adviser to Coventry Cathedral, directing the medieval mystery plays there in 1962 and 1964. In 1967 and 1968 he was directing at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, the plays being <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span>, <span class="italic">The Family Reunion</span>, Thornton Wilder's <span class="italic">Our Town</span> and <span class="italic">The Long Christmas Dinner</span>, and the medieval morality play, <span class="italic">Everyman</span>.<br>
<br>Browne was a specialist of absolute integrity and of massive determination. Though his passion for theatre-as-art was intense and his work became, deservedly, well known on both sides of the Atlantic, he never showed any inclination to compromise his aesthetic ideals for the sake of popular acclamation or commercial appeal. It is true that his directorial style was perhaps &#145;caviare to the general&#146;, somewhat solemn and spare, on occasion. J. C. Trewin, the theatre critic, said of Browne's production of Laurie Lee's <span class="italic">Peasants' Priest</span> at the 1949 Canterbury festival: &#145;E. Martin Browne directed with some ingenuity &hellip; Ingenuity, yes: but where was the drama's kindling flare?&#146;  (Trewin, 120). And the same critic remarked, about the Mercury Theatre venture, &#145;Martin Browne, father-confessor of the new poet-dramatists, is a good actor and a director of talent. But I can only regret his choice of plays&#146;  (ibid., 90). But seen in its totality Browne's work added a unique and valuable dimension to the pattern of English mid-twentieth-century theatre. He was appointed CBE in 1952. Following the death of Henzie Raeburn, he married on 24 November 1974 Audrey Johnson, a medical social worker, the widow of John Rideout and daughter of Noel Johnson Tuck. He died in the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, on 27 April 1980, survived by his second wife.<br>
