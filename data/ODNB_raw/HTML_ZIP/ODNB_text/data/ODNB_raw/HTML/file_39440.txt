</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashcroft, Dame  Edith Margaret Emily <span class="st"> [Peggy]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 22 December 1907 in Croydon, Surrey, the second of two children of William Worsley Ashcroft (1878&#150;1918), a land agent, and his wife, Violetta Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bernheim (1874&#150;1926), a keen amateur actress of Danish and German-Jewish descent. Known from childhood as Peggy, Ashcroft was brought up in a comfortable, bookish, middle-class world destroyed by the First World War, in which her father (a major) died in action in 1918. But, in the course of her education at Woodford School, Croydon, she came under the inspirational spell of an elocution teacher, Gwen Lally, who furthered her childhood passion for Shakespeare: in Miss Lally's annual Shakespeare productions Ashcroft shared leading roles with Diana Wynyard, another future actress, even incorporating business she had read about in Henry Irving's performances or seen for herself in Charles Doran's touring productions.<h2>
<a name="Earlystagecareerandmarriages"></a>Early stage career and marriages</h2>Fired by her love of Shakespeare and Shaw, English poetry and theatrical history, Ashcroft decided at sixteen, against fierce maternal and educational opposition, to go on the stage: the first sign of an obduracy that was to sustain her throughout her career. She enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama, which was based in the Albert Hall and run by a formidable female Napoleon, Elsie Fogerty. The emphasis was on vocal rather than dramatic training, against which both Ashcroft and a shock-haired fellow-student, Laurence Olivier, secretly chafed. What changed Ashcroft's life were two experiences that happened outside the school. In 1924 she read the first English translation of Stanislavsky's <span class="italic">My Life in Art</span>: its account of the ensemble idealism of the Moscow Art Theatre and of the actor's need for &#145;an artistic sensitivity to truth&#146; opened her eyes to a new kind of theatre. In 1926 she went to a season of four Russian plays directed by the Russian emigr&eacute; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34361/', "Theodore Komisarjevsky (1882&#150;1954)")</script> at a suburban theatre in Barnes: this taught her that a theatrical text, in the hands of a master director, could become an orchestrated score in which acting, lighting, and design all played their part. From the age of nineteen Ashcroft longed to be part of a permanent company: that dream, rather than any hunger for individual stardom, became the driving force of her career. In the 1920s no such company existed in the haphazard, predominantly commercial, climate of British theatre. But she possessed an eager, darting impulsiveness and a clear, musical voice that quickly got her work.<br>
<br>Ashcroft made her professional d&eacute;but in 1926, while still a student, playing the fantasy-daughter to Ralph Richardson's childless, would-be artist in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Dear Brutus</span> at Birmingham Repertory Theatre. She returned to Birmingham a year later to play opposite Laurence Olivier in John Drinkwater's <span class="italic">Bird in Hand</span>: well as she got on with her contemporary, she never entirely believed his later assertion that only the sudden noise of a flushing lavatory prevented his proposing marriage to her over tea in Birmingham digs. Her first marriage, in fact, was to a tall, good-looking young actor with an Eton and Oxford background, Rupert Charles Hart-Davis (1907&#150;1999), the only son of Richard Vaughan Hart-Davis and his wife, Sybil Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper, the elder sister of Alfred Duff Cooper, first Viscount Norwich. Ashcroft got to know Hart-Davis during a tour of <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> in 1929. They married on 23 December 1929. According to Hart-Davis, in later years, it was &#145;chiefly an intellectual and spiritual passion, tied up with poetry, music, drama, youth and spring&#146;  (Billington, 33).<br>
<br>But, although the marriage had little physical basis and quickly foundered, it led to a lifelong friendship. Hart-Davis went on to an extremely successful career as a publisher and author.<br>
<br>Whatever her marital disappointment, Ashcroft's reputation as an actress steadily grew: in an age of affected <i>ing&eacute;nues</i> with cut-glass voices she was conspicuous for her vocal naturalness and psychological truth. She was admired as the maidenly Naemi who plunges melodramatically to her death in Ashley Dukes's version of <span class="italic">Jew S&uuml;ss</span> and even more for her Desdemona opposite Paul Robeson's Othello at the Savoy in 1930: &#145;when Peggy came on in the Senate scene&#146;, wrote Gielgud, &#145;it was as if all the lights in the theatre had suddenly gone up&#146;  (Billington, 40). Gielgud was, in fact, to prove a crucial influence on Ashcroft's career. In 1932 he directed her in an Oxford University Dramatic Society production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> that brought together a group of talents that were to have a decisive effect on British theatre. The production was designed by three young women, Elizabeth Montgomery, Margaret Harris, and Sophia Harris, who were to combine under the collective name of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74321/', "Motley")</script>; Edith Evans was the Nurse; and, among the undergraduate cast, George Devine played Mercutio, Hugh Hunt Friar Lawrence, and Terence Rattigan a masker who, each night, following Juliet's presumed death, got an inexplicable laugh on the line &#145;Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone&#146;. Ashcroft, conveying the ardour of young love, responded warmly to Gielgud's direction.<br>
<br>Ashcroft fell under the spell of another magus when she appeared in a Sunday-night production of <span class="italic">Le cocu magnifique</span> for Komisarjevsky, whom she subsequently lived with and, on 1 December 1934, married: from him she learned the vital importance of discipline, perfectionism, and the idea that the actor, even during passages of emotional stress, must remain &#145;a thinking human being&#146;. Just how difficult it was to put those ideals into practice she learned when she played ten leading roles in pell-mell succession at the Old Vic in 1932&#150;3: only Gielgud's fairy-tale production of <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, in which Ashcroft's Portia was praised for its sincerity and truth, rose above the general level of tumultuous tat.<br>
<br>Ashcroft, an accomplished classical actress in search of a real company, now found herself appearing in a succession of continental disasters, though one of them revealed her instinctive hatred of injustice. In 1933 an anti-fascist claque vehemently demonstrated on the first night against the appearance of the famous German actor Werner Krauss in an adaptation of Hauptmann's <span class="italic">Before Sunset</span>. Ashcroft, appearing in the same production, was sent before the curtain where she launched a passionate appeal for calm. It worked; but only on a later visit to Berlin, when Krauss offered her an introduction to Hitler, did she realize that he had collaborated with the Nazis in order to sustain his career. The episode demonstrated Ashcroft's reflex hatred of intolerance. But by 1935, already abandoned by Komisarjevsky and with her career still at the mercy of the freelance jungle, Ashcroft seemed as far as ever from her dream of a company. The turning point came with an approach from Gielgud to play Juliet at the New Theatre with himself and Olivier alternating as Romeo and Mercutio. It was to be a straight West End run, but Gielgud, in addition to Motley as designer, retained many of the actors&#151;including Harry Andrews, Alec Guinness, and George Devine&#151;with whom he had worked at the New in the previous two seasons. A classical company was being formed in a commercial context, and the result was a landmark production in which Ashcroft was praised for adding tragic depth to her earlier portrait of Juliet's eagerness and innocence. Many of the same family of actors stayed together for a production of <span class="italic">The Seagull</span>, directed by Komisarjevsky at the New: even though it was difficult for Ashcroft as Nina to be directed by her former husband she was praised for capturing the crucial, last-act transition whereby, in the words of Charles Morgan, she seemed &#145;changed by suffering but not obliterated by it so that what she was is visible through what she has become&#146;  (Billington, 83).<br>
<br>After a brief excursion to New York, where she felt out of place in Manhattan's show-business village, Ashcroft returned to London in 1937 for a four-play Gielgud season at the Queen's, where she played the Queen in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>, Lady Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Irina in <span class="italic">Three Sisters</span>, and Portia in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. The directors were Gielgud himself, Tyrone Guthrie, and Michel Saint-Denis. The company, in addition to the Gielgud regulars, included Michael Redgrave, Anthony Quayle, Glen Byam Shaw, and Rachel Kempson. In effect the foundations were being laid for the post-war seasons at Stratford upon Avon, which in turn sowed the seeds for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. For Ashcroft herself it was like a spiritual homecoming, and even if an attempt to perpetuate the company ideal at the Phoenix Theatre under Saint-Denis fell foul of the Munich crisis, it still enabled Ashcroft to play her first Viola and to prove her passionate belief that nothing could be achieved in theatre without permanence.<h2>
<a name="Warandpostwaracting"></a>War and post-war acting</h2>Inevitably any prospect of establishing a long-term company was demolished by the outbreak of the Second World War. For Ashcroft herself it was also a time of personal reassessment. During the phoney war in the spring of 1940 she was on tour in a play by Clemence Dane, <span class="italic">Cousin Muriel</span>, when she was visited in her Brighton dressing room by Jeremy Nicolas Hutchinson (<i>b</i>. 1915), a barrister and the only son of St John Hutchinson, a famous criminal lawyer, and his wife, Mary, a notable Bloomsbury hostess and only daughter of Sir Hugh Shakespear Barnes, civil servant in India. After a whirlwind wartime courtship Hutchinson and Ashcroft married on 14 September 1940 and, while Hutchinson was away on active service with Mountbatten's fleet in the Mediterranean, surviving the sinking of HMS <i>Kelly</i>, their daughter Eliza was born in June 1941. Acting, for Ashcroft, came second to motherhood in the war, though in 1943 she became a founder member of the Apollo Society, which combined poetry recitals and music, and she appeared spasmodically in the West End. In 1944 she joined Gielgud's third attempt to found a classical company, playing Ophelia, Titania, and the Duchess of Malfi at the Haymarket. It was only a modest success: many of the original pre-war &#145;family&#146; were on active service, two of the productions by Nevill Coghill and George Rylands were ploddingly old fashioned, and the whole venture was upstaged by the exciting Olivier&#150;Richardson Old Vic seasons at the New Theatre. When the Haymarket season ended in 1945 Ashcroft took a two-year break from acting both to help campaign for her husband, who stood as a Labour candidate in the general election, and to have a second child, Nicholas, in 1946.<br>
<br>If Ashcroft's classical aspirations were stalled by war and motherhood, she returned to the stage with a visibly increased emotional depth. She astonished everyone with her graphic portrait of alcoholic disintegration in <span class="italic">Edward, my Son</span>, by Robert Morley and Noel Langley. She triumphed as the plain, unloved, cruelly maltreated Catherine Sloper in <span class="italic">The Heiress</span>, opposite Ralph Richardson. She also conquered her own self-doubt to score a success in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">The Deep Blue Sea</span>, as the highly sexed high-court judge's wife, Hester Collyer, who falls in love with a callow test pilot. She once confessed to John Osborne that she got bored because she found Hester &#145;such a silly bitch&#146;: Frith Banbury, the play's director, believes that Ashcroft initially drew back from the character because it required a degree of self-revelation. Whatever her private agonies, the result was, in Kenneth Tynan's phrase, &#145;a scorchingly realistic portrait of a woman in love beyond her lover's means&#146;  (Billington, 142).<h2>
<a name="Ashcroftandthecompanyideal"></a>Ashcroft and the company ideal</h2>The 1950s was a decade in which Ashcroft constantly confounded expectations. She scaled the austere peaks of Greek tragedy in <span class="italic">Electra</span>. As a Stratford Cleopatra she proved that she could encompass erotic fulfilment as well as sexual suffering. She was also a brilliantly flinty Hedda Gabler, embodying her own private note on the character, &#145;that Hedda must be like an iceberg with fire underneath&#146;  (Billington, 154). Even her occasional failures, such as her appearance in the dual roles of the good-hearted prostitute and her capitalist male cousin in <span class="italic">The Good Woman of Setzuan</span>, were the product of excess audacity: not many actresses would have made the move, as Ashcroft did in 1956, from playing Enid Bagnold's <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> at the Haymarket to Brecht's moral fable at the Royal Court. In fact her radical temperament and espousal of left-wing causes led the West End producer Binkie Beaumont to dub her the Red Dame on her acceptance of a DBE in 1956. If that remark betrays a faint peevishness, it was because Ashcroft was gradually withdrawing from the West End to the kind of company ideal she had long championed.<br>
<br>Ashcroft not only allied herself with the Royal Court. Late in 1958 Peter Hall outlined to her his bold new plan for a &#145;Shakespeare Memorial Theatre&#146; that would involve three-year contracts, a mixture of classical and contemporary work, and dual homes for a new company in Stratford upon Avon and London. She instantly agreed to become a part of it. As Hall said, &#145;The creation of the RSC owes a great deal to her presence. Not just because of the superlative work she did but because of her moral example.&#146; That moral example was seen in her wholesale commitment to Hall's first Stratford season in 1960. She played Kate in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, for which she was arguably too old; Paulina in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, for which she was too young; and the title role in Webster's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span>, which she had already played fifteen years before: needless to say, she scored a great success in each role. Her devotion to the company ideal was never more evident than in her commitment to <span class="italic">The Wars of the Roses</span>, the massive historical epic that Peter Hall and John Barton fashioned out of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry VI</span> trilogy and <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. Just as the twelve-week rehearsal was about to start in 1963, Peter Hall, its prime director, collapsed. While his doctors prescribed six months' rest, Ashcroft along with Peter Brook urged him to get back to work: she also offered him unstinting support throughout the rehearsal process. At the same time she was fashioning her own monumental performance as Margaret of Anjou. It began with her as an auburn-haired French bride of startling girlishness; progressed in the middle section to the isolated foreign queen and maddened, blood-streaked, battle-hungry she-wolf; and ended with her as a sad, bedraggled figure, haunting the court she had once entered as a young bride. It was not merely her protean range that astonished&#151;it was the revelation of an untapped demonism lurking within Ashcroft herself and of an overwhelming imaginative power. Her performance finally laid to rest the accusation that she was simply an exquisite miniaturist: this was acting on the &#145;the Big Bow-Wow&#146; scale.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerfilmsandtelevision"></a>Later career, films, and television</h2>Ashcroft's greatest theatrical triumph coincided with a period of considerable turmoil in her own private life: in the early 1960s her marriage to Jeremy Hutchinson had begun to fall apart, leading to a divorce in 1966. But, for Ashcroft, work seemed to provide a salve to unhappiness and she embraced, with ever greater fervour, the work of the most adventurous living dramatists. She appeared in Marguerite Duras's <span class="italic">Days in the Trees</span> and <span class="italic">The Lovers of Viorne</span>, in Edward Albee's <span class="italic">A Delicate Balance</span> and <span class="italic">All over</span>, and in Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">Landscape</span> and <span class="italic">A Slight Ache</span>. She seemed to have an especial affinity with Pinter: as Beth in <span class="italic">Landscape</span> she sat in a humble kitchen chair with a cardigan draped around her shoulders, remembering the past with erotic ecstasy but entirely estranged from the husband sitting opposite her. It was as if a door had come down between them. &#145;Not, I feel, an ordinary door,&#146; said Pinter, &#145;but a great big clanking, iron door that she had pulled down between her and the rest of the world&#146;  (Billington, 222).<br>
<br>Ashcroft's later years were characterized by many fine performances for both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre: Winnie in Beckett's <span class="italic">Happy Days</span>, Ella Rentheim in Ibsen's <span class="italic">John Gabriel Borkman</span>, and, above all, a Countess in <span class="italic">All's Well that Ends Well</span>, blessed with an amused tolerance and wisdom born, one felt, of the actress's own life experience. But the most startling aspect of Ashcroft's final period was her delighted immersion in the world of film and television. She had acted spasmodically in film from the early 1930s, when she had appeared in <span class="italic">The Wandering Jew</span> and in Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The 39 Steps</span>. But her ability to distil her art for the camera became apparent in a superb series of performances in the 1980s. As Frau Messner in the BBC television film of Stephen Poliakoff's <span class="italic">Caught on a Train</span> she captured, with the help of archive recordings of Lotte Lehmann, the precise tones of an imperious old Viennese party travelling through Europe with a prickly young publisher. Even more remarkable was her performance as the former missionary teacher Barbie Batchelor in Granada Television's fourteen-part version of Paul Scott's <span class="italic">The Jewel in the Crown</span>&#151;a performance that caught the tragedy of an elderly eccentric constantly dislodged from one bolt-hole to another and finally subsiding from voluble decency into a fierce, dumb despair. Ashcroft's Indian summer was extended further by her performance as Mrs Moore in David Lean's film of <span class="italic">A Passage to India</span>: she took a character who, on the page, is a saintly blur and endowed her with a radiant good sense and spiritual glow for which she was justly rewarded with an Oscar for best supporting actress.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Ashcroft went on acting to within two years of her death, which took place at the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 14 June 1991, following a stroke. She was survived by the son and daughter of her third marriage. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 30 November 1991, at which Harold Pinter and Sir Peter Hall gave addresses. She had received many honours, including the king's gold medal, Norway, 1955, and honorary degrees from five universities, the first being Oxford (1961). She was an honorary fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford. Off-stage Ashcroft was a woman who had a profound impact on all who came into contact with her. She was passionate, loyal, downright, earthy, adamant in her espousal of liberal causes (she was an ardent supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament), intensely curious in her attitude to the world, and fiercely reticent when it came to investigation of her private life. Making a film and writing a book about her in her later years, I was always stimulated by her willingness to discuss theatre, politics, books, cricket, and people, yet also aware of an aura of solitude, as if she lacked the consolation of permanent companionship. But, professionally, she was a great actress who combined emotional attack, imaginative sympathy, and tonal accuracy. She was, even more importantly, a born crusader who helped to change the British theatre by her visionary belief in companies and by her practical dedication to making them happen. She was born an Edwardian yet she embraced the modern. She was a star yet she was happiest within the extended family of a theatrical troupe. If acting, as David Hare claimed, is a judgement of character, then Ashcroft's whole career was a testament to her granite-like integrity.<br>
