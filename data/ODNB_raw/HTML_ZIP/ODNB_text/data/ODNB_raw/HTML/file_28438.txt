<span class="headword">Waldegrave,  James</span>, second Earl Waldegrave  (1715&#150;1763), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was born on 4 March 1715, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28437/', "James Waldegrave, second Baron and first Earl Waldegrave (1684&#150;1741)")</script>, of Navestock, Essex, and his wife, Mary (1695/6&#150;1719), the second daughter of Sir John Webb of Hatherop, Gloucestershire. The name is often spelt Waldgrave or Walgrave, evidence of its pronunciation. The Waldegraves were a Catholic family, with a Jacobite tradition, and the first baron died in exile in 1690 at the Stuart court of St Germain. The second baron, who had a Catholic wife and a Jacobite father-in-law, renounced this religious and political allegiance of his family about 1722, but these antecedents sometimes haunted his son. Conversion to the Church of England opened the path to political advancement. In 1723 the second baron was appointed a lord of the bedchamber, a post he held until his death in 1741, and one that gave him access to the sovereign. The &pound;1000 salary was welcome, for in the reign of George I the combined income of the Waldegrave estates, Navestock and Borley in Essex and Chewton in Somerset, was under &pound;3000. He served as ambassador to Vienna from 1728 to 1730, and then at Paris until 1740. Among his rewards were the titles in 1729 of Earl Waldegrave and Viscount Chewton, the latter being used as a courtesy title by his son James, who left Eton College in 1732 to assist his father in the Paris embassy, soon as his confidential secretary.<br>
<br>James succeeded to his father's titles and estates on 11 April 1741 and took his seat in the Lords thirteen days later. He followed in his father's steps as a courtier, and George II evidently took to the young second earl, appointing him a lord of the bedchamber in 1743. &#145;It looks as if it was His Majesty's own doing&#146;, the duke of Newcastle, accustomed to dispense patronage, informed a disappointed applicant  (McCann, 132). Waldegrave held the post until 1752, taking his turn at personal attendance on the sovereign. In parliament he sided with the Pelham ministry, refusing an invitation to join the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96922', "Leicester House")</script> opposition of Frederick, prince of Wales. Waldegrave preferred social life to politics, White's Club to Westminster; however, he combined with his delight in eating and gambling an interest in literature and philosophy, Montesquieu being a favourite author. In the 1750s he had to abandon pleasure for politics, and even wrote memoirs that form a chief historical source for the period; first published in 1821, they reappeared in a scholarly edition of 1988. George II had plans for Waldegrave, and vainly sought to make him ambassador to Paris, like his father, so as to qualify him to be secretary of state. The prime minister, Henry Pelham, and his brother the duke of Newcastle thought him unsuitable for high office. The earl, wrote Pelham in 1751, was:<blockquote>as good-natured, worthy and sensible a man as any in the kingdom, but totally surrendered to his pleasure; and I believe that mankind, and no one more so than himself, would be surprised to see him in such an office. (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 49)</blockquote>The death of the prince of Wales that year enabled the king to do something for Waldegrave, for the duchy of Cornwall reverted to the crown. On 18 April 1751 George II appointed Waldegrave lord warden of the stannaries, a post, worth &pound;450 a year, connected with the tin mines and with much patronage in Cornwall. The next year he was given a far more significant post, governor to the new young prince of Wales. After Lord Harcourt resigned it several others refused before Waldegrave accepted that onerous post, one that brought him membership of the privy council but involved much anxiety and attention. He gave up his comfortable bedchamber place for one of only the same salary. Contrary to some reports he did so willingly. Newcastle was the intermediary because, as Waldegrave noted, &#145;his Majesty did not chuse to speak to me himself, that I might be at full liberty to either accept or refuse as I liked best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 57 n. 179). He was governor of the future George III as the prince grew from fourteen to eighteen. The princess dowager in 1753 had &#145;a very good opinion of him, that he was very well bred, very complaisant, and attentive, etc., and the children liked him extremely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Journal of &hellip; Dodington</span>, 202).<br>
<br>Waldegrave's friendly character and enjoyment of royal favour made him an obvious political broker in the crises of the mid-1750s. In 1754 he helped Newcastle to secure the support of Henry Fox for the ministry he formed on Pelham's death. But he was obviously the ministry's man at Leicester House, and he fell out of favour there when the prince's court went into opposition at the end of 1755. A decision had to be made when the prince came of legal age on his eighteenth birthday, 4 June 1756, for the post of prince's governor would then lapse. George II pushed for Waldegrave to be head of the prince's household as his groom of the stole, but the prince wanted his mother's friend Lord Bute. Waldegrave escaped from a difficult situation by securing royal permission to resign from the prince's household: he also gave up his post of lord warden of the stannaries. He was offered and refused an Irish pension, but accepted the reversion of a lucrative tellership of the exchequer, which fell in during February 1757. Waldegrave gained revenge on his foes at Leicester House by fanning current rumours about an illicit relationship between Bute and the princess dowager, a scandal that persisted into the next century, being zealously retailed by Waldegrave's friend Horace Walpole. It was probably resentment at Waldegrave's role in this respect that caused George III to recall him in 1804 as &#145;a depraved worthless man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 53).<br>
<br>As the confidant of George II, Waldegrave was the intermediary in the prolonged negotiations of 1757 preceding the formation of the Pitt&#150;Newcastle coalition ministry. He was the conduit of correspondence between the king, Newcastle, and Fox. When matters seemed to have reached an impasse, with Newcastle insisting on the inclusion of Pitt, whom George II detested, Waldegrave himself agreed on 8 June to be first lord of the Treasury in a ministry wherein Fox would be the leading figure: since he never formally took up the appointment, however, he cannot be listed among British prime ministers, and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> errs in stating he was &#145;premier&#146; for five days. On 11 June he advised George II to accept Pitt, and he quit politics for social life, being rewarded for his services on 30 June with the Garter. Waldegrave now found time to get married, and Horace Walpole claimed the credit for the match. The bride was Walpole's niece <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73898/', "Maria (bap. 1736, d. 1807)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29456/', "William Henry, Prince")</script>], the second illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole and Dorothy Clements. &#145;A month ago&#146;, Horace wrote on 11 April 1759, &#145;I was told he liked her&#151;does he?&#151;I jumbled them together, and he has already proposed. For character and credit, he is the first match in England&#151;for beauty, I think she is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 4.254). The marriage took place on 15 May 1759, the bride at twenty-two being half the age of the groom. Three daughters were born, but politics soon obtruded on the domestic bliss at Navestock.<br>
<br>When George II died on 25 October 1760 Waldegrave was one of the few men closely acquainted with the new monarch, and eased his embarrassment at his first privy council by chatting to him. George III evidently did not at this time harbour any grudge against his former governor. Soon the king planned to enlist Waldegrave's support for the peace terms negotiated by the Bute ministry in 1762, and Fox was sent to enquire whether he would attend cabinet if asked. &#145;The Earl, who had been bred a courtier, who was of too gentle manners for opposition&#146;, Horace Walpole wrote, &#145;desired time to consider.&#146; He consulted the duke of Cumberland, the king's uncle and Bute's enemy, and then &#145;wrote to Fox to desire the proposal might not be made to him&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.155&#150;6). But he approved the peace terms, and told Cumberland, &#145;as to opposition in general, I may oppose measures which I think wrong. But I shall never enter into engagements with any factions&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 51380, fol. 107). He spoke for the peace on 9 December.<br>
<br>When in March 1763 Bute's decision to resign led to the planning of a new ministry, Waldegrave was again considered for high office. Fox put him forward as &#145;a man of strict honour, will go through what he engages in without any indiscretion, has great firmness, with great gentleness of manner, is by his friends both respected and beloved, has few enemies, and no view to popularity&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.143). But George III dismissed the suggestion, writing that &#145;he would fairly be but a chip in the porrige&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute</span>, 199). Waldegrave opposed the Bute ministry in the Lords debate of 28 March on the cider tax. Yet the very next day Fox, who had earlier proposed Waldegrave to Bute as lord lieutenant of Ireland, vainly offered him the ambassadorship to Paris. Death then suddenly put an end to all such ideas. On 30 March Waldegrave contracted smallpox, against which he had not been inoculated when young, as &#145;the eldest son and weakly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 5.303). He died at Albemarle Street, London, on 8 April, to the consternation and dismay of high society, after dedicated nursing by his wife, whose uncle Horace Walpole was astonished &#145;to see so much beauty sincerely devoted to a man so unlovely in his person&#146;  (ibid., 5.297). He was buried in Navestock church. His estate produced only &pound;2300 a year, but out of his tellership income he had saved enough to endow his three daughters with about &pound;8000 each, and they later married well. His widow was married secretly in 1766 to the king's younger brother, the duke of Gloucester, and died on 22 August 1807.<br>
<br>Waldegrave's titles and estates passed to his only surviving brother, <a name="cosubject_28439"></a><span class="headword">John Waldegrave</span>, third Earl Waldegrave  (1718&#150;1784), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>. Born on 28 April 1718 at Ghent, he also left Eton in 1732 for Paris. &#145;My youngest would never be a scholar&#146;, wrote his father  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 30), and so John entered the army in 1735. Like his brother he was a member of White's Club and enjoyed a busy social life. In 1751 &#145;by the intrigues of the Earl of Sandwich&#146;, so Horace Walpole wrote, &#145;Colonel John Waldegrave stole Lord Gower's daughter&#146;  (ibid., 41). His bride, against her father's wishes, was Elizabeth Leveson-Gower (1724&#150;1784), the fifth daughter of the first Earl Gower; they had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28444/', "William Waldegrave, first Baron Radstock")</script>, and two daughters. This was a valuable political connection, for the duchess of Bedford was his wife's sister. But the Waldegraves were first and foremost courtiers, and John was appointed a groom of the bedchamber in 1747, with a salary of &pound;500, a post he retained, into the reign of George III, until his peerage in 1763. In 1747 he was also appointed aide-de-camp to the duke of Cumberland and brought into the House of Commons for the government borough of Orford. In 1754 he transferred to the Gower borough of Newcastle under Lyme, which he represented until his elevation to the Lords. None of this prevented John Waldegrave enjoying a successful military career: he served in the wars of 1740&#150;48 and 1756&#150;63, rising steadily in rank from ensign in 1735 to major-general in 1757. He was the British hero at the battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, where his success in leading the British infantry against the French cavalry was the crucial factor in the famous victory. His wife boasted to Bedford on 4 August, &#145;Mr Waldegrave is not only adored by the army, but by all the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Speeches</span>, 86). His rewards included promotion to lieutenant-general, a colonelcy in the dragoon guards, and in 1760 appointment as governor of Plymouth. Made a full general in 1772, he took offence when in 1770 secretary at war Lord Barrington told the House of Commons that there was no military officer fit to be appointed army commander-in-chief. Waldegrave retired from active service when the end of the Seven Years' War coincided with his peerage. He voted with the Bedford party in the Lords, as against the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in 1766, but always with government after they returned to office in 1767&#151;apart from the Fox&#150;North coalition. He died on 22 October 1784, suddenly of apoplexy at an inn near Reading, and was buried at Navestock on 30 October.<br>
