<span class="headword">Salter,  John Henry</span>  (1862&#150;1942), <span class="occ">naturalist and diarist</span>, was born on 5 June 1862 at Westleton, Suffolk, the son of William Henry Salter (<i>d</i>. 1869/70) and his wife Lucy, formerly Appleton. His Quaker parents were shopkeepers. He had one brother, William. His father died when he was seven, and the family then moved to Scarborough. He attended the Quaker school at Ackworth, Yorkshire, studied botany at Flanders College and Owens College, Manchester, and taught at Quaker schools in Lisburn in Northern Ireland, in Yorkshire, and in Birmingham. He was briefly on the staff of University College, London, before going to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1891 as assistant lecturer and demonstrator in biology. He initiated the College Scientific Society in 1892. In 1896 he had leave of absence for nine months at Bonn University in Germany where he worked on starch grains, and for this work he gained his DSc from University College in 1897. In that year he spent three months at Marburg University in Germany, working on the relationship between the algal and fungal components of lichens.<br>
<br>Salter was appointed first professor of botany at Aberystwyth in 1899, and on 15 August the same year he married Adah Sophia (1862/3&#150;1917), the daughter of Henry Freeman, a Birmingham tea blender. They had two sons, Arnold and Ronald. He resigned his chair in 1903, but held minor posts as curator of the University Museum and lecturer in bacteriology and entomology in the agricultural department until 1908, when because of his wife's deteriorating health he retired completely and in December took her and their sons to G&uuml;imar on Tenerife. In February 1910 they moved to south-east France, staying at a variety of health resorts including Arcachon, Bagn&egrave;res-de-Bigorre, and Capbreton. They moved to Verwood in Dorset in 1916 and after Adah's death there in 1917 and the completion of his sons' education, Salter returned to Aberystwyth in 1923, living for the rest of his life at Fairview, Llanbadarn Fawr, on the outskirts of the town.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Salter made extensive collections of plants and insects which are now in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales. He published many papers and notes, chiefly in the <span class="italic">North Western Naturalist</span>. One of his chief interests was in discovering the height above sea level at which plants could grow, and this resulted in a paper, <span class="italic">The Altitudinal Range of Flowering Plants and Ferns in Mid Wales</span> (1928). He wrote a <span class="italic">List of the Flowering Plants and Ferns of Aberystwyth and Neighbourhood</span> [1901], followed by <span class="italic">The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Cardiganshire</span> (1935) which is still the only flora of the county. His stay in the Canaries resulted in a paper <span class="italic">Regional Distribution of the Native Flora in Teneriffe</span> (1918), and he is commemorated in the name of a Tenerife moss <i>Brachythecium salteri</i> Cardot &amp; Dixon. His herbarium, now at the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff, comprised some 3000 specimens, including 700 plants that he grew in his own garden at Fairview, the flowering dates of which he meticulously recorded in his diaries.<br>
<br>Ornithology was Salter's other main interest, also resulting in many short articles, <span class="italic">List of the Birds of Aberystwyth and Neighbourhood</span> (1900), and a popular book, <span class="italic">Bird Life throughout the Year</span> [1913]. Although he was an enthusiastic egg collector (it is not known whether his collection has survived), he was not a shooter and often deplored the activities of those who were. He was very much a conservationist in his concern for birds as well as for plants and wild places, and in 1903 he initiated through the British Ornithologists' Club the red kite protection scheme that led to the revival of the fortunes of this species in mid-Wales. The scheme is still in existence.<br>
<br>Salter's greatest legacy is probably his natural history diaries, now in the National Library of Wales. They contain entries covering sixty-eight years and are immensely readable, carefully composed (presumably mostly from field notebooks that have disappeared), and give a vivid picture of his days in the field especially in Cardiganshire, Tenerife, the western Pyrenees, and Dorset. As a descriptive source for the state of plant, bird, and other animal life of the countryside in his time they are invaluable, and they contain much still unpublished information of importance. Although his correspondence has not been preserved, he copied much relevant material from it into his diaries. In Cardiganshire he frequently walked 20&#150;30 miles a day and never owned a car. He was a tall, quietly spoken, shy and retiring man, a Quaker, a vegetarian, a teetotaller and a non-smoker. In spite of his academic career, it is as a local naturalist who was the main source of information on the natural history of Cardiganshire and the neighbouring parts of mid-Wales for over fifty years that he is best remembered. He was found dead after a fall in his garden on 5 August 1942, never having fully recovered from a prostate operation in March of that year. He was buried with a Quaker funeral on 8 August in Llanbadarn Fawr churchyard.<br>
