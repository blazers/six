<span class="headword">Digby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stanley]</span>,  Venetia</span>, Lady Digby  (1600&#150;1633), <span class="occ">gentlewoman and celebrated beauty</span>, was born on 19 December 1600 at Tong Castle, Shropshire, the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1629?), from a younger branch of the family of the earls of Derby, and his wife, Lady Lucy Percy (<i>b</i>. before 1572, <i>d</i>. 1601?), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21956/', "Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland (1528&#150;1572)")</script>. Venetia's mother died a few months after her birth and she was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith of her family by Francis and Grace Fortescue, of Salden, Buckinghamshire. At nearby Gayhurst lived another Catholic family, the Digbys, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7629/', "Sir Kenelm Digby (1603&#150;1665)")</script> later recorded in his <span class="italic">Loose Fantasies</span>, that he and Venetia were childhood friends and sweethearts, despite the fact that he was two and a half years younger.<br>
<br>Growing up to be a very beautiful young woman, Venetia was presented at the court of James I, where she was pursued by many aristocratic admirers, among them Edward Sackville, later fourth earl of Dorset. According to contemporary gossip recounted in Aubrey's <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, Venetia had affairs with several young men, including Sir Edmund Wyld and the earl of Dorset; the latter allegedly had &#145;one if not more children by her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 260). There is no evidence to support these allegations, however, and the rumours of Venetia's promiscuity as a young unmarried woman were hotly denied by Sir Kenelm in his memoirs and letters. After a period of separation during which Digby was abroad the couple were married about May or June 1624 (though some sources suggest January 1625). As Sir Kenelm later explained to his sons, the marriage was kept secret for years, mainly because of strong disapproval of the match by both Sir Kenelm's mother and Venetia's father, from whom Venetia was hoping for a financial settlement. While Sir Kenelm was away at sea, on 6 October 1625, Venetia had her first child, Kenelm, in secret, with no help except that of a single servant. In all she had five more pregnancies: she had a son, Everard, who died as an infant, two more sons, John and George, and twins whom she lost in a miscarriage. All her labours were &#145;exceeding painefull and dangerous&#146;, as her husband recalled, but she suffered with stoic patience, with her husband at her side holding her hand, which she said &#145;did abate a great part of her paines&#146;  (Digby, <span class="italic">Letter-Book</span>, 126).<br>
<br>All contemporary sources agree that Venetia was the perfect companion to Sir Kenelm: a loyal, chaste, and obedient wife, a loving and careful mother, a frugal and efficient housewife, and a fervent Roman Catholic like her husband. She gave large sums to the poor, earning the money through gambling, in which pursuit she was both skilful and lucky. Toward the end of her short life she became increasingly pious, mortifying herself with fasts, penances, and the wearing of a hair shirt, partly because of her premonition that she would die young like her mother. In the event her premonition was fulfilled: she died suddenly in her sleep on 1 May 1633 at the Digby London residence at Charterhouse Yard, and was buried three days later. An autopsy performed by several eminent physicians found that her brain tissue was &#145;much putrifyed and corrupted: all the cerebellum was rotten, and retained not the forme of the braine but was meere pus and corrupted matter&#146;  (Digby, <span class="italic">Letter-Book</span>, 134).<br>
<br>Venetia Digby was painted by Anthony Van Dyck both in her lifetime (as the allegorical figure Prudence) and on her deathbed. Sir Kenelm also had a death mask made. A number of contemporary poets including Ben Jonson dedicated elegies to her memory (a manuscript volume of elegies is now Add. MS 30259 in the British Library). Although Venetia herself composed devotional meditations and other works, none of her own writings has survived. Virtually all the information on her life and death comes from Sir Kenelm's autobiographical romance, <span class="italic">Loose Fantasies</span>, and his memorial letters to his sons and other relations written after Venetia's death.<br>
