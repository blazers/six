<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Denis Holden</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">television and radio producer</span>, was born on 1 August 1911 in Cheadle, Cheshire, the younger child and only son of Ernest George Mitchell, Congregational minister, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alderson. The family went to South Africa when he was six but returned to England when he was ten, his father having been appointed minister of a church at Redhill, Surrey. Mitchell attended Caterham School, Surrey, where he twice failed his matriculation examination.<br>
<br>Mitchell shared his mother's enthusiasm for drama, and as a teenager his temporary work included the carrying of spears at the Old Vic theatre. At the age of eighteen he returned to South Africa, where he stayed until 1949. His first work was as a bank clerk, and during his holidays he appeared as an actor in local stage productions, as well as acting and writing radio scripts for the South African Broadcasting Corporation.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Mitchell volunteered for service in the South African artillery, but because of his knowledge of drama and radio he was soon transferred to the entertainment unit of the Union Defence Force, being promoted to the rank of captain and placed in command of its operation in the Middle East and Italy. One of the members of his unit was Sid James, the actor.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Mitchell worked briefly for a local newspaper, and then joined the staff of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. His programme work covered a wide range, but his main concern, he insisted, was with &#145;real people and real voices&#146;, and his own personality, quiet and sympathetic, explains why no interviewer has extracted more by saying less. His passion for drama had already vanished, never to return.<br>
<br>On the advice of the BBC features producer D. G. Bridson, who had visited South Africa, Mitchell returned to Britain in 1949 and in 1950 became the BBC's features producer in Manchester, near to his birthplace. Most of his programmes were based on interviews with people whose voices were rarely heard: the homeless, nurses, the unemployed, and criminals. He always walked alone, often at night, usually finding people by chance. At a time when cameras and microphones were mainly studio-based, he worked out in the streets, recording people in their own surroundings.<br>
<br>In 1955 Mitchell was briefly attached to the BBC television service in London, where he made his first documentary film, about teenagers, which gained an award at the Brussels Experimental Film Festival. On his return to Manchester in 1956 he continued to make television documentaries, notably <span class="italic">Morning in the Streets</span> (1959), which won both the Prix Italia and an award of the Society of Film and Television Arts. He joined the Television Service at Shepherd's Bush in 1959, continuing his own style with <span class="italic">Soho Story</span>, about a London busker, but he also returned to Africa to make a series, <span class="italic">The Wind of Change</span>, and in 1961 he produced <span class="italic">Chicago</span>, the story of a city &#145;seen through the eyes of the people who live there, from the very poor to the extremely rich&#146; (Denis Mitchell's notes proposing the film).<br>
<br>Mitchell left the BBC in 1962, and the following year formed Denis Mitchell Films Ltd, a small company which survived until his death. It made documentaries for many organizations, including ATV, the BBC, Rediffusion, Southern Television, and Channel 4. Much of his most personal work was made for Granada Television, based again in Manchester, and his subjects (especially in the series <span class="italic">This England</span>, 1964&#150;7) were usually &#145;ordinary folk&#146;; but his interviewing technique was equally effective in <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> (1972&#150;3), in which the subjects came from many classes of society. A programme which he always regarded as one of his best was a portrait of Quentin Crisp. Towards the end of his life he became increasingly keen on making very short programmes, lasting between five and ten minutes, whose subjects were inevitably men and women in various walks of life. He made over 100 documentaries, and in 1975 received the SFTA's Desmond Davis award for his outstanding talent.<br>
<br>Mitchell was of medium height, with hazel eyes and brown hair; he was gentle and softly spoken, and frequently smiling. In 1938 in Durban he married Dorothea (Sally), daughter of William Arthur Bates, telegraphic engineer in the Post Office. They had two daughters, the younger of whom died in 1970. His first marriage was dissolved in South Africa in 1948, and in 1951 he married Betty Annie, a BBC secretary and the daughter of a transport inspector, Albert Elmer Horne. They had one son. His second marriage was dissolved in 1965, and in the same year he married (Norah) Linda, who had been his secretary in the BBC, the daughter of John Hastings Webster, chartered accountant. They lived in the Norfolk countryside, the location of his film <span class="italic">Never and always</span> (1977), which expressed its social history as seen by the local people. Mitchell died on 30 September 1990 at his home, Avondale, 42 Station Road, Great Massingham, Norfolk (although his death certificate gives 1 October as the day of death).<br>
