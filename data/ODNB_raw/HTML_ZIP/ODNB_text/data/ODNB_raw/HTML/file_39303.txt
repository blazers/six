<span class="headword">Pierrepont <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Medows]</span>,  Charles</span>, first Earl Manvers  (1737&#150;1816), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 14 November 1737, the second son of Philip Medows (1708&#150;1781), deputy ranger of Richmond Park, and Frances Pierrepont (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;1794), sister of Evelyn, second duke of Kingston upon Hull. He entered the navy, becoming lieutenant in 1755 and post captain in 1757, and in 1762 was in command of the <i>Isis</i>. He resigned his commission in 1763.<br>
<br>On the death of his uncle the duke of Kingston in 1773 Charles Medows became heir presumptive to the vast Pierrepont estates which went to the duke's widow for her lifetime. On 14 March 1774 he married Anne Orton Mills (1756&#150;1832), youngest daughter and coheir of William Mills of Petersham, Surrey; they had four sons and a daughter. Despite challenges from his elder brother, Evelyn, leading to the widowed duchess being declared bigamous in 1776, the will was not overturned, and after her death in 1788 Medows held lands in Nottinghamshire (including Thoresby Hall and Holme Pierrepont Hall), Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Somerset, Devon, and Wiltshire. He also had London property.<br>
<br>By royal licence Charles Medows now changed his name to Pierrepont. Sponsored by the duke of Newcastle, he was elected to parliament for Nottinghamshire in 1778, promising to do his utmost for poor manufacturers in a time of framework knitters' disputes. No speech of his in the Commons is known, but he is known to have opposed William Pitt in 1784 and 1791 and was listed as a whig supporter of the duke of Portland in 1792. From about 1781 to 1792 he was a protonotary in the Palace Court, Westminster, and was made a DCL at Oxford University in 1793. He retained his seat in the Commons until 1796, when he was created Viscount Newark through Portland's influence. In 1806 he obtained the title of Earl Manvers from the Grenville ministry. In the Lords he voted against Catholic emancipation.<br>
<br>Through his position in parliament Pierrepont was able to promote the enclosure movement, then reaching its height, throughout his constituency. Between 1779 and 1796 he was associated with the passing of twenty-six Nottinghamshire enclosure bills and six that were initially withdrawn. (After his viscountcy he can be linked to over thirty more between 1797 and 1815 through his sons who also sat as MPs.) His interest in agricultural change is confirmed by his appointment as vice-president of the board of agriculture in 1803.<br>
<br>Between 1788 and 1803 Pierrepont was involved with a large-scale landscaping scheme at Thoresby Hall which cost over &pound;22,500. This was devised by Humphry Repton of Romford, and included the planting of oaks which met with the approval of the Society for the Advancement of Arts. He employed William Wilkins (later architect of the National Gallery) as designer of estate houses for his tenants and to survey his Bath property. Lord Manvers died at his London house in Portman Square on 17 June 1816 and was buried on 28 June at Holme Pierrepont. He was succeeded by Charles Herbert, second Earl Manvers, his second but eldest surviving son.<br>
