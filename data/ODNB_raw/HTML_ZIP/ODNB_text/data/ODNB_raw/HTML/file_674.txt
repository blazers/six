<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arne,  Thomas Augustine</span>  (1710&#150;1778), <span class="occ">composer and musical performer</span>, was born in King Street, Covent Garden, London, on 12 March 1710, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70963/', "Thomas Arne (bap. 1682, d. 1736)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70961/', "Arne family")</script>], upholsterer and undertaker, and his second wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wheeler (<i>d</i>. 1757). Thomas the younger was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 28 May 1710. The middle name Augustine was adopted in childhood, apparently as a sign of allegiance to his mother's Roman Catholic faith.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Arne attended Eton College in the early 1720s, although his name does not appear in any manuscript list. There, he is said to have displayed a great love of music, playing the recorder at all hours to the annoyance of his fellow pupils, secretly practising the spinet at night with muffled strings while at home during the holidays (although the same story has been told of Handel), and trying his hand at composition. He became a violin pupil of Michael Festing (who had been a pupil of Francesco Geminiani) some time about 1725 and attended the opera free of charge by borrowing the livery of servants for use as a disguise. Arne was however directed by his father towards a career as a lawyer, and in 1726, after leaving Eton, he was apprenticed to Arthur Kynaston, a London attorney, for three years. But music retained its hold over Arne, at the expense of a probably far more secure and, at the time, high-ranking legal career. His father, like many others in his position and despite evident musical interests, may not have relished the thought of his son playing the violin in public, but Arne was headstrong and had found his true vocation: opposition was futile.<br>
<br>Arne gave singing lessons to his younger sister Susannah Maria (1714&#150;1766) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5417/', "Cibber, Susannah Maria")</script>] and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70962/', "Richard Arne")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70961/', "Arne family")</script>], and his father was involved with the financing of the English operas performed initially at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, from March 1732. Arne was therefore able to enter into the theatrical world with relative ease and enjoyed early success as a composer for the stage. His opportunity came when the company split in autumn 1732. Arne moved to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he staged <span class="italic">Teraminta</span>, by Henry Carey and John Stanley, in November, with his sister in the title role, and followed this with his own opera <span class="italic">Rosamond</span> on 7 March 1733. The latter involved both of Arne's siblings and achieved a respectable number of performances. After returning to the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, Arne then produced during the next season his setting of Henry Fielding's afterpiece <span class="italic">Tom Thumb: a Tragedy</span>, as <span class="italic">The Opera of Operas, or, Tom Thumb the Great</span>. Despite competing against Lampe's setting of the mainpiece version at Drury Lane, Arne's version enjoyed a fifteen-night run, beginning on 29 October 1733; this achievement was surpassed by his own masque <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span>, which had seventeen performances from 12 January 1734.<h2>
<a name="DruryLaneComusandRuleBritannia"></a>Drury Lane, Comus, and Rule, Britannia</h2>Arne was now successful in his own right and had become a catalyst for the revival of English opera, but was still able to benefit enormously from new alliances. In April 1734 his sister Susannah married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5418/', "Theophilus Cibber (1703&#150;1758)")</script>, an actor and playwright whose company was based at Drury Lane and whose father was Colley Cibber, at that time poet laureate and one of the shareholders of the patent which allowed theatrical performances at Drury Lane. This opened the door for Arne to become house composer at the theatre, writing music for various plays and pantomimes and involving both his brother and his sister. He lived in Great Queen Street and Lincoln's Inn Fields about this time. Charles Arne, probably the &#145;natural son&#146; of Arne referred to by Charles Burney in <span class="italic">A General History of Music</span>, was baptized on 9 January 1734, although Arne himself was not married until 15 March 1737, when, at Lincoln's Inn chapel, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/672/', "Cecilia Young (1712&#150;1789)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69663/', "Young family")</script>] became his wife. Her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74841/', "Charles Young (bap. 1686, d. 1758)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30283/', "Young, William")</script>], organist of All Hallows Barking, objected to Arne's Catholicism and his daughter's subsequent conversion. His sister and new wife were both great assets to Arne, as tragedienne and singer respectively, and were used to great effect in his setting of <span class="italic">Comus</span> (John Milton's masque as adapted by John Dalton), which ran at Drury Lane from 4 March 1738. This work remained in the repertory into the following century. The combination of talent from the Arne and Cibber families, a resurgence of interest in Milton, and the simple melodic charm of Arne's score ensured its great success. Arne's music was imitated by Handel in his <span class="italic">L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato</span>, an oratorio that like <span class="italic">Comus</span> was adapted from Milton.<br>
<br>The rise in Arne's stature within the London musical scene continued during the late 1730s. In 1738 he joined Handel, Boyce, and John Christopher Pepusch as a founder member of the Society of Musicians (later the Royal Society of Musicians) and set the masque <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, by David Mallet and James Thomson, to form part of an event initiated by Frederick, prince of Wales, in 1740. Set in the gardens of the prince's seat, Cliveden (then usually spelt Cliefden) House, near Taplow, Buckinghamshire, it honoured the third birthday of the prince's daughter Augusta. &#145;Rule, Britannia&#146; was among the original musical numbers. The masque itself was subsequently adapted and was transformed into both an oratorio, performed at Drury Lane on 20 March 1745, and an opera under the title <span class="italic">Alfred the Great</span>, given at Covent Garden on 12 May 1753. The &#145;plaintive poignancy&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) of Arne's contributions to various Shakespeare plays revived at Drury Lane in the 1740&#150;41 season also ensured their enduring success. The songs included &#145;Under the Greenwood Tree&#146; for <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, first heard on 20 December 1740, and &#145;Where the bee sucks&#146; for John Dryden's and Thomas Shadwell's version of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, revived with Arne's songs on 28 November 1740, although &#145;Where the bee sucks&#146; may not have been introduced until 31 January 1746. Arne's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/673/', "Michael Arne (1740/41&#150;1786)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70961/', "Arne family")</script>], was born about this time but was not the son of Cecilia Arne. By November 1741 Arne was living at 17 Craven Buildings, near Drury Lane, and at this time made a successful setting of William Congreve's masque of 1700 <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>, performed at Drury Lane on 12 March 1742.<br>
<br>Arne sought to retain as much financial interest as was possible in his works after they were first performed, and was reputedly a difficult negotiator over contracts, a trait attributed to his legal training. He published some of his early compositions himself, without selling the copyrights to a bookseller, with the intention that he would retain any profits from their sale, and on 29 January 1741 had been granted royal privilege to protect his works from being printed without his permission for fourteen years. The privilege did not deter two booksellers, Henry Roberts and John Johnson, from continuing to print and sell songs from <span class="italic">Comus</span> and <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>. Arne responded by bringing a bill of complaint in the court of chancery on 12 November 1741. The case did not proceed beyond its initial pleadings, suggesting that an out-of-court settlement was made. The agreement must have favoured Arne's claim to copyright, as booksellers seem subsequently to have respected his copyright, printing the words to his songs in collections only, without the music. Arne's interest in the copyright issue continued to influence his career, and even after the expiry of his royal privilege in 1755 he continued to publish warnings that his compositions could not be printed without his consent, citing the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1710 and the argument supported by some lawyers that there existed a perpetual copyright in common law.<h2>
<a name="DublinandlaterDruryLanecareer"></a>Dublin and later Drury Lane career</h2>Arne's sister's flight to Dublin in December 1741, following the failure of her marriage to Cibber, provided the impetus for him to tear himself away from London and attempt to emulate Handel's success in the Irish capital. Susannah had sung in the first performance of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> on 13 April 1742, and Arne arrived in Dublin on 30 June, accompanied by his wife and Thomas Lowe, the tenor who had given the first performance of &#145;Rule, Britannia&#146;. During Arne's two seasons in Dublin the works he performed included Handel oratorios (in collaboration with Matthew Dubourg) and one of his own contributions to the genre, <span class="italic">The Death of Abel</span>, performed at the Smock Alley Theatre on 18 February 1744. Soon afterwards he travelled back to London, visiting Chester <i>en route</i>, where he met the young Charles Burney. Arne took on Burney as his apprentice without demanding the usual fee, and the two travelled together to London. Burney's later writings as a music historian remain a valuable source of information on Arne's life.<br>
<br>Back in London, Arne resided next door to The Crown in Great Queen Street and continued to compose music for Drury Lane, including a burlesque opera to a libretto by Colley Cibber, <span class="italic">The Temple of Dullness</span>, first performed on 17 January 1745. This all-sung work in the Italian style was not well received. Arne's setting of &#145;God Bless our Noble King&#146; better captured the public mood, appearing in September 1745 as London began to realize that the Jacobite rising in Scotland presented a serious threat. About the same time he composed popular vocal music for Jonathan Tyers's musical entertainments at Vauxhall Gardens. Arne's association with the pleasure gardens was long and fruitful, resulting in over 200 songs (many of which were performed by his wife), and contributed to the restoration of the health of English popular song. Collections of Arne's songs, including those published as part of the series <span class="italic">Vocal Melody</span> (1749&#150;64), contain numerous examples.<br>
<br>Arne was however falling out of favour as a composer for the theatre. Work for Drury Lane began to dry up as David Garrick, manager from 1747, turned to other composers. Arne eventually followed his sister to Covent Garden for the 1750&#150;51 season. Some of his compositions at this time brought disappointments: <span class="italic">Henry and Emma</span>, a play with songs for Thomas Lowe's benefit at Covent Garden on 31 March 1749, adapted from a poem by Matthew Prior, was received badly by audiences. Its librettist, Thomas Holt, would sue Arne and Lowe for allegedly breaking an unprecedented agreement that gave Holt a continuing interest in the printing and performance of the songs; the case, filed in the court of exchequer in 1752, reveals that in 1749 Arne expected a fee of 30 guineas for composing the music for a play, more than the annual salary for a non-leading actor. Arne naturally resisted Holt's claims and defended his right to publish his compositions after their first performance. <span class="italic">Don Saverio</span>, for which Arne wrote both the words and the music, was first performed at Drury Lane on 15 February 1750. It was another attempt at an all-sung comic opera, but was hissed by the audience and closed after three performances. About this time Arne occupied houses in Great Queen Street, the Strand, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and Covent Garden.<h2>
<a name="The1750sand1760s"></a>The 1750s and 1760s</h2>In the 1750&#150;51 season the two theatres at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, with Arne and Boyce as their house composers, embarked on a period of fierce rivalry, epitomized by competing productions of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> on 28 September, that was to the long-term advantage of neither the theatres nor the composers. Arne was forced to turn to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, for the extremely short-lived opera <span class="italic">Eliza</span> (29 May 1754), featuring Cecilia Arne; it was ordered to close after one performance, perhaps because the Little Theatre was not licensed for opera. His setting of David Mallet's patriotic masque <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was performed at Drury Lane on 9 May 1755, but for a sustained residency at a theatre he had to return to the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in October of the same year. On this occasion he was joined by one of his numerous pupils, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3322/', "Charlotte Brent (1734&#150;1802)")</script>, and by his wife's niece <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61855/', "Mary (Polly; Maria) Young (1749&#150;1799)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69663/', "Young family")</script>] (later wife of the French violinist and composer Fran&ccedil;ois Hippolyte Barth&eacute;lemon), as well as his wife, although their marriage was by this point clearly unstable. Cecilia's poor physical and perhaps mental health and Thomas's incessant philandering contributed to its fragility. In 1756, when the season came to a close, Arne returned to London with Charlotte Brent, who had become his mistress, and set up home in the Covent Garden area. Cecilia remained in Dublin with Polly Young until 1762 and, despite some financial assistance from Arne (&pound;40 a year), was forced to teach singing and rely on the assistance of others in order to survive.<br>
<br>Arne on the other hand was gaining income from collections of his (predominantly theatrical) music, both instrumental and vocal, published by John Walsh. He received an Oxford doctorate of music on 7 July 1759, and his relationship with Charlotte Brent proved as fruitful in professional and musical terms as earlier alliances had been. With John Beard as manager they were a successful partnership at Covent Garden, staging Arne's revision of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> (10 October 1759) and from 28 November 1760 the influential <span class="italic">Thomas and Sally</span>, to a libretto by Isaac Bickerstaff. With this piece Arne at last fulfilled his ambition of pleasing a London audience with an all-sung comic opera in the Italian style. It also included perhaps the first use of the clarinet by an English composer. The opera <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>, first performed on 2 February 1762, was a pioneering Italianate <i>opera seria</i> in English with an especially challenging part for Charlotte Brent. In it Arne moved away from the Handelian baroque style of vocal composition, and although Burney criticized him for this, Arne was followed by subsequent British composers. <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span> remained part of the operatic repertory in Britain well into the nineteenth century. He also contributed the music for <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, again by Isaac Bickerstaff, first performed on 8 December 1762, which set a fashion for pastiche opera, and which was captured in a painting by Johan Zoffany. His musical and commercial triumphs away from Covent Garden about this time included the acclaimed oratorio <span class="italic">Judith</span>, first performed at Drury Lane on 27 February 1761. It foreshadowed the un-Handelian style of <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span> and has been described as &#145;arguably the finest oratorio by an Englishman before [Edward Elgar's] <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>&#146;  (Holman and Gilman). A repeat performance at Covent Garden (26 February 1773) was the first occasion on which female sopranos were used in place of boys in oratorio choruses.<br>
<br>Arne's fortunes took a turn for the worse during the mid-1760s. In addition to musical failures (including the lost opera in Italian <span class="italic">L'olimpiade</span>) and little demand from either Covent Garden or Drury Lane, in 1766 his sister Susannah died and on 16 October the same year Charlotte Brent married the violinist Thomas Pinto. He staged concerts of catches and glees (he was a professional member of the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club and the Madrigal Society) but struggled to afford his wife's meagre support payments; she threatened him with legal action in 1770.<h2>
<a name="Careerrevivalandfinalyears"></a>Career revival and final years</h2>Arne continued to live around Covent Garden, moving from the Little Piazza to West Street to Bow Street, and produced works of great musical merit towards the end of his life. Despite their cool relationship, Garrick appointed Arne musical director for the Shakespeare festival at Stratford upon Avon in September 1769, for which Arne composed several pieces including <span class="italic">An Ode upon Dedicating a Building to Shakespeare</span>. The success of the ode led Arne to renew his relationship with the theatres. He remained attached to the masque form, despite his own development of the opera having helped render it outdated: he contributed music to Garrick's version of John Dryden's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> (at Drury Lane, 13 December 1770), and received over &pound;120 from Covent Garden for the masque <span class="italic">The Fairy Prince</span> (1771) to a text by George Colman the elder. Music (now lost) for William Mason's <span class="italic">Caractacus</span>, performed at Covent Garden on 6 December 1776, received particular critical acclaim from contemporaries as prominent as Samuel Arnold. The theatrical version of <span class="italic">Caractacus</span> was published with a preface and introduction by Arne in which he presented his ideas on the relationship between poetry and music and on the constitution of the orchestra. Even at this stage of his life he remained anxious to protect his copyrights, and in 1772 deposed for John Pyle, John Walsh's executor, when Pyle brought a case against the bookseller Robert Pyle for printing music on which Walsh held the copyright, including some of Arne's work.<br>
<br>Arne was reconciled with his wife, Cecilia, in October 1777, but he was taken ill soon afterwards (his will is dated 6 December) and died of a &#145;spasmodic complaint&#146; while conversing &#145;on some musical matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) on 5 March 1778 at a house in Bow Street, Covent Garden. He was buried, despite his Roman Catholicism, in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden. The will, proved on 16 March 1778, granted administration to his wife and &#145;only son&#146; Michael. Among the effects disposed of on 8 April were a fine harpsichord and a variety of other musical instruments. The Covent Garden Theatre fire of 1808 destroyed many of his manuscripts, but several are held by the British Library.<br>
<br>Arne inevitably found himself in Handel's shadow for much of his career, particularly with respect to the oratorio, but although influenced in some respects by Handel he was a versatile and prolific theatre specialist and an important innovator in dramatic genres. He in fact influenced and developed his style beyond Handel's output in terms of both musical language and orchestration.<br>
<br>In his setting of &#145;God Save our Noble King&#146; and especially in &#145;Rule, Britannia&#146; Arne established two musical epitomes of British nationhood. However, he contributed a great deal to the legacy of English song and the development of English music in general far beyond his most famous composition. His Catholicism probably hindered his recognition in his own day, as unlike William Boyce or John Stanley he was never associated with the royal court; <span class="italic">Alfred</span> was an isolated work, commissioned for a prince in opposition.<br>
<br>The well-known Francesco Bartolozzi caricature of the composer wearing a sword while playing a chamber organ shows Arne to have had a slender physique with pointed features. He was evidently not of an easy temperament and may even be judged to have been cruel on occasion. Even if his &#145;probity&#146; was not &#145;equal to his talents&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) and his output was not consistently accomplished and well judged (particularly the texts he set), the &#145;ease and variety&#146;  (ibid.) of his style allowed him, at his best, effectively to blend simplicity of expression with technical mastery at an exceptionally high level.<br>
