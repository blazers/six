<span class="headword">Walpole,  Robert</span>  (1650&#150;1700), <span class="occ">agricultural improver and politician</span>, was born on 18 November 1650 at Houghton, Norfolk, the second but eldest surviving son of Sir Edward Walpole (1621&#150;1668) and his wife, Susan Crane (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1667). From 1667 he studied briefly at Trinity College, Cambridge, but his formal education was ended by the death of his father on 18 March 1668. Walpole was only seventeen when he inherited his family's estates, from which he had to provide for seven younger siblings. About 22 February 1671 he married Mary Burwell (1654/5&#150;1711), daughter of Sir Jeffrey Burwell of Rougham, Suffolk; the couple were subsequently the prodigious parents of seven daughters and ten sons. Of these the eldest surviving son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28601/', "Sir Robert Walpole (1676&#150;1745)")</script>, the celebrated whig politician and chief minister of George I and George II, and the second surviving son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28595/', "Horatio Walpole, first Baron Walpole of Wolterton")</script>. Although Robert Walpole's own achievements have largely been obscured by the brilliance of his famous son, they were significant in their own right. During his brief time at Cambridge he acquired a reputation for &#145;learning and study extraordinary&#146;  (North, 3.304), and his scholarly interests persisted throughout his life. He founded the great library at Houghton and regularly stocked it with good editions of the Latin classics, history, law, and theology. Fascinated by the new learning, he acquired nearly all the works of Sir Francis Bacon.<br>
<br>Walpole was equally serious in the management of his own estates, where his intelligence can best be seen. He was quick to realize the value of agricultural techniques pioneered in Flanders and Holland, and by the 1670s he and his Norfolk neighbours were introducing many of the practices hailed a century later by Arthur Young as an &#145;agricultural revolution&#146;. He introduced crop rotation and devoted extensive acreage to turnips, clover, and grasses in order to enrich the light, sandy soil of his farms. Swift to seize his chances when he scented gain, he successfully experimented with growing wheat and made regular profits by fattening cattle for the voracious London market. Walpole's enterprise was matched by his frugality. Holding a tight rein on his own and his family's spending, he gradually increased the productivity of his holdings. He then invested the bulk of accumulated capital in additional land, thus transforming an inheritance worth little more than &pound;800 a year into an estate which yielded in excess of &pound;1300 per annum (Plumb, <span class="italic">Men and Places</span>, 123&#150;7; Plumb, <span class="italic">Sir Robert Walpole</span>, 83&#150;6).<br>
<br>Walpole also harboured political ambitions. He was appointed justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for Norfolk in 1673 and was moderately active in those capacities. Yet in the 1670s and early 1680s he gave no overt sign of his later whiggish inclinations. He did not join his colleagues on the lieutenancy who resigned in 1676 over the ouster of the proto-whig lord lieutenant, Horatio, Lord Townshend. Furthermore, in March 1682 he surprised Townshend's tory and crypto-Catholic successor, Lord Yarmouth, by signing the loyal address abhorring the whig association. However, in 1688 he refused to consent to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and was removed from local office  (Cruickshanks, 663). When the king offered to restore him in October 1688, Walpole declined to act &#145;in conjunction with persons unqualified or incapacitated by the law of the realm&#146;  (Cozens-Hardy, 89).<br>
<br>Restored to office by William III, in 1689 Walpole was elected MP for the pocket borough of Castle Rising on the duke of Norfolk's interest. From 1690 onwards he departed from his usual parsimony to buy up enough cottages (burgages) carrying a vote to gain control over one of the borough's seats  (Ingleby, 33&#150;4), and these investments assured his election in 1690, 1695, and 1698. However, Walpole's parliamentary career was to be curtailed by the deterioration of his health. He explained his irregular presence in the Commons after 1692 as due to his &#145;consumptive&#146; condition  (Hayton). Nevertheless, accounted a &#145;Court Whig&#146;  (Cruickshanks, 663), he was a dependable supporter of whig measures when able to attend parliament and was regarded a leader of the Norfolk whigs in the late 1690s. Walpole died at Houghton Hall on his fiftieth birthday, 18 November 1700, and was buried at Houghton.<br>
