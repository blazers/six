<span class="headword">Haddow, Sir  (Thomas) Douglas</span>  (1913&#150;1986), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 9 February 1913 at Summit Schoolhouse, Crawford, Lanarkshire, the son of George Haddow, the local schoolmaster, and his wife, Helen Jamieson Stewart. He was educated at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University, where he graduated with a first-class MA (honours) degree in mathematics (1932), and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he held a scholarship and read for the mathematical tripos and graduated as a wrangler in 1934. He took first place in the competition of 1935 for entry into the administrative grade of the civil service, but surprised everyone by electing to serve in the Department of Health for Scotland in Edinburgh rather than one of the more prestigious London departments. He was the first direct entrant from the administrative grade to enter the department, which had previously been staffed with executive-grade officers. On 15 September 1942 he married Margaret Ross Steven Rowat (1913/14&#150;1969), a clerical officer in the Department of Health and the daughter of David Rowat, an Edinburgh master tailor. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1941 Haddow became private secretary to Tom Johnston, the secretary of state for Scotland, and learned much from Johnston's assertive approach to defending the Scottish interest in Whitehall and his deep-seated desire to be seen leading Scottish attitudes. In 1943 Haddow was promoted to assistant secretary in the department. He was closely associated with the preparatory work that led to the introduction of the National Health Service in Scotland, which in contrast to England aroused very little criticism from the medical profession. He forestalled potential unrest through his appreciation of the strong relationship between medical education in the four Scottish cities and the financial position of the consultant in teaching hospitals. In 1948 he spent a year in the USA studying the health services as a fellow of the Commonwealth Fund and returned to become the under-secretary responsible for the Scottish hospital services.<br>
<br>During the early 1950s Haddow played a leading role in advising ministers on the methods required to control and reduce hospital costs, largely by the introduction of time and motion studies of labour and the strict control of supplies. He subsequently advised ministers to resist a Treasury attempt to impose a boarding charge for hospital care. Haddow argued that the low income of many families in Scotland would mean the extensive use of a means test, thus raising administrative costs and transferring a significant proportion of the supposed savings to the National Assistance Board. As in the rest of the UK, the charge was not introduced.<br>
<br>In 1956 Haddow became the under-secretary responsible for town and country planning and was immediately involved in the overspill arrangements designed to move a third of Glasgow's overcrowded population into new towns and other settlements across Scotland. By 1958 he saw that the overspill programme could usefully link a public-health issue with the economic regeneration of Scotland in a planned and co-ordinated manner, and he became an advocate for reorganizing the Scottish departments around this task. He devised a plan to create a development department which combined the housing and physical planning functions of the Department of Health with that of the roads, electricity supply, and development area functions of the Scottish home department. However, he failed to convince a somewhat conservative Scottish Office, whose officials opposed it.<br>
<br>In December 1961 the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), SC(DI), an independent body, published a report on the Scottish economy (the Toothill report) which recommended that a Scottish development department should be established and that government regional policy should be aimed at stimulating investment in areas, such as new towns, with the potential to grow. Haddow denied that his office had influenced the report (despite the presence of departmental assessors on the SC(DI) inquiry), but in June 1962, following a reorganization of offices, a development department was finally established, of which he became secretary. After a sustained campaign at official and ministerial level, the government's regional policy was altered in the following year and led to the creation of a fifth Scottish new town at Irvine, where a number of new light industries had been established.<br>
<br>Haddow became permanent under-secretary at the Scottish Office in 1965 and immediately established a regional development division (RDD) of senior officials directly responsible to his office. The group's aim was to maintain close contact with UK economic ministries in London to ensure that the Scottish interest in investment discussion was maintained more directly at official level. The period after 1965 witnessed considerable structural change in the Scottish economy with the run-down and closure of many collieries and Clydeside shipyards. Inevitably this increased unemployment, and Haddow's later career was overshadowed by repeated Scottish Office attempts to prevent closures. Such efforts masked much of the substantial work that Haddow's RDD pursued in attracting overseas investment to the new towns, which by the early 1970s totalled nearly a quarter of Scottish factory space. On his retirement from the civil service in 1973, he was made chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, combining this with part-time membership of the South of Scotland Electricity Board, an innovative appointment designed to bring the work of the two boards into closer partnership. He was appointed KCB in 1966.<br>
<br>To colleagues, Haddow's approach to administration was distinguished by its energy and directness of style. His forthright manner and speed in reaching a decision often conflicted with civil service traditions, but in the context of the issues besetting post-war Scotland he helped convert a rather cautious office into one prepared to accept challenge, operate at a more strategic level, and take risks. At times this led to bitter argument, but where it affected a younger colleague Haddow usually apologized. Outside the office Haddow's main interest was in golf; his tendency to play in khaki shorts and eat a bowl of rice pudding afterwards was confirmation to many of his single-minded sense of purpose. He died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 26 December 1986 after a short illness.<br>
