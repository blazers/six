<span class="headword">Davies,  David</span>, first Baron Davies  (1880&#150;1944), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born on 11 May 1880 at Llwynderw, Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, the only son of Edward Davies (1852&#150;1898) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of the Revd Evan Jones of Llandinam. He was educated at Merchiston Castle, Edinburgh, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was placed in the third and second classes respectively of the two parts of the historical tripos in 1901 and 1903. His father, Edward, died young in 1898, and David inherited the vast industrial empire created by his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37343/', "David Davies (1818&#150;1890)")</script>, &#145;top sawyer&#146;, in railway construction, coalmining in the Rhondda valleys, and building the docks at Barry. The grandson took over these immensely profitable concerns, to which he added directorships of the Great Western Railway and the Midland Bank. From the outset, he was a multi-millionaire.<br>
<br>Early on, Davies followed the family tradition of public service and benefaction mainly in Wales. He was a prominent member of the councils of the university colleges in Wales and of the court of the national university, and from 1926 served as president and chairman of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. The college owed much to him, with his funding of an imposing new chemistry laboratory named after his father, Edward (opened by H. H. Asquith in 1907), and later purchases of land and property. Davies was also much involved with the founding of the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth in 1911, and he served as its president from 1927. His munificence extended also to housing development and support of his own Calvinistic Methodists in the Presbyterian Church of Wales, while his two sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39573/', "Gwendoline Elizabeth Davies")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39572/', "Margaret Sidney Davies")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39573/', "Davies, Gwendoline")</script>], made Gregynog Hall a rare centre of culture and the arts in the inter-war years.<br>
<br>Davies's most striking initiative, however, was the Welsh National Memorial Association, in memory of Edward VII, launched by Davies in 1911 with a gift of &pound;150,000 and with Thomas Jones appointed as its executive secretary, in order to combat the scourge of tuberculosis in Wales. There followed a research centre in Cardiff and the David Davies chair of tuberculosis at the Welsh National School of Medicine in 1921. The association set up residential sanatoria throughout Wales and was credited with a significant drop in the mortality rate from the disease. However, the Clement Davies committee in 1939 found that tuberculosis was still more serious in Wales than anywhere else in Britain. The association's limitations, for instance in not dealing with aftercare, later became clear, for all its commendable role in heightening public consciousness.<br>
<br>Like his grandfather, Davies hankered after a political career, and he was returned unopposed as Liberal member for Montgomeryshire in the general election of January 1906. Most unusually, he was nominated by both Liberals and Unionists in the constituency, and was indeed far from radical in his social and political views. Socially, as a large landowner who rode enthusiastically with the Llandinam hunt, he had traditional views on landlord&#150;tenant relations and opposed many of Lloyd George's land reform proposals. At his election he was a tariff reformer who disliked Irish home rule and who had opposed the Welsh Liberals' &#145;revolt&#146; against the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. However, he gave broad support to Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; and subsequent welfare measures. In general, however, Davies was an inactive MP during his tenure of the Montgomeryshire seat until 1929. He was returned unopposed in both elections in 1910 and in 1918, 1922, and 1923, and the local Liberal association went into decay while Davies busied himself with his industrial and philanthropic interests.<br>
<br>Davies's career, like that of many others, entered a quite new phase with the outbreak of war in August 1914. He fought in France as commander of the 14th Royal Welch Fusiliers and was made a major. However, in July 1916 he became parliamentary private secretary to Lloyd George, newly appointed to succeed Kitchener as secretary for war. In the complex political manoeuvres of autumn 1916 he was prominent in urging his fellow Liberal members that Lloyd George replace Asquith as prime minister. When Lloyd George became premier in December 1916 he made his fellow Welshman Davies one of the five initial members of his private secretariat or &#145;garden suburb&#146;. Davies's responsibilities included war strategy and munitions, and he accompanied Lord Milner on his visit to Russia in January 1917. However, he proved a dissatisfied aide to Lloyd George and produced a stream of unsolicited criticisms from &#145;Dafydd Pob Man&#146; (&#145;David Everywhere&#146;), as he called himself. The prime minister sacked him with singular brutality in June 1917.<br>
<br>Thereafter Davies was a frequent critic of Lloyd George. Although he received the coalition's &#145;coupon&#146; of endorsement in 1918, he attacked the post-war government on many fronts, including the disendowment settlement for the Welsh church. By contrast, he voiced support for the Irish peace treaty and offered up to &pound;1 million to purchase <span class="italic">The Times</span> in August 1922 as a pro-Lloyd George newspaper. However, he strongly attacked Lloyd George's radical land proposals in the &#145;green book&#146; in 1925 as rank socialism and announced thereafter that he would not stand at the next election. He tried unsuccessfully to nominate a successor, but Clement Davies was chosen in the face of the sitting member's hostility and succeeded him as Liberal member for Montgomeryshire at the general election of 1929.<br>
<br>By this time David Davies was consumed by a mighty cause, which dominated the remainder of his life: the League of Nations, established after the Versailles peace settlement in 1919. Created Baron Davies of Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, on 21 June 1932, he campaigned ceaselessly for the league in speeches and writings, through the National Press Agency which controlled the <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span> and <span class="italic">Everyman</span>, and in two books, <span class="italic">The Problem of the Twentieth Century</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">Force</span> (1934). Above all, there was a powerful pressure group, the League of Nations Union, of which he was founder and trustee, along with figures such as Lord Robert Cecil and Professor Gilbert Murray. Davies passionately championed the effective pursuit of collective security by giving the backing of force to the league covenant and giving new authority to the International Court. His particular theme was the creation of an international police force, especially an air force. However, critics felt his vision of nation states merging their sovereignty in a new world order to be a pipe dream. Many members of the union were far less enthusiastic than Davies for military sanctions, and in 1932, after the ineffective world disarmament conference, he founded the New Commonwealth Society to promote his ideas for an international equity tribunal whose decisions would be enforced by an international police force. He was much disillusioned at the failure of the league to stop the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the Japanese invasion of China, and in the Lords and on the public platform expressed his feelings of &#145;humiliation and dismay&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 110, col. 1422, 4 Oct 1938) over Chamberlain's and Halifax's appeasement policies and especially Munich.<br>
<br>Davies's passion for the league extended into his public activities in Wales. In 1919 he endowed the Woodrow Wilson chair of international politics at Aberystwyth, which was first held by Sir Alfred Zimmern; in 1936 he protested bitterly when the college appointed E. H. Carr, a mordant critic of the &#145;utopianism&#146; of league supporters like Davies. Thereafter, although he remained president of the college, he steadily withdrew from active involvement in its affairs. More positively, in 1938 he provided the Temple of Peace and Health in Cathays Park, Cardiff, as a centre for both the Welsh League of Nations Union and the National Memorial Association. It was to continue as an educational agency for world citizenship. During the war he wrote in favour of a federated Europe. In 1951, after his death, the David Davies Memorial Institute of International Studies was founded to continue his work in promoting international co-operation and integration, and conflict resolution.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1910 Davies married Amy (<i>d</i>. 1918), the daughter of Lancelot Penman of Broadwood Park, Lanchester. They had a daughter who died in infancy and a son, David, known as Michael. On 9 December 1922 Davies married again, his second wife being Henrietta Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of James Grant Fergusson of Baledmund, Pitlochry, Scotland. They had two sons and two daughters. Davies died suddenly at Deildre, Llandinam, on 16 June 1944. He was succeeded as second baron by his son from his first marriage, David, who was killed in action in Holland three months later.<br>
<br>Davies was an imperious, impatient idealist who stamped his personality on Welsh, and to a degree on British, life over three decades. An active freemason, he was generous and public-spirited, given to embracing great crusades for causes such as health or world peace. He was also passionately committed to temperance. But he was liable to assume that his wealth alone would decide outcomes and that colleagues and opponents could be steamrollered into submission, whether in the parliamentary or the university world. He was a prickly colleague, who almost inevitably fell out with Lloyd George, but Thomas Jones and many others found themselves drawn by his charisma and vision. His positive impact on the public life of Wales was immense.<br>
