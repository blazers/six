<span class="headword">Blackwell,  Thomas</span>  (1701&#150;1757), <span class="occ">classical scholar and historian</span>, was born on 4 August 1701 in the city of Aberdeen, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2543/', "Thomas Blackwell (1660?&#150;1728)")</script>, one of the ministers of Aberdeen, later professor of divinity, and his wife, Christian Johnstoun (<i>d</i>. 1749). His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2539/', "Alexander Blackwell")</script>. He was educated at the grammar school of Aberdeen and studied Greek and philosophy at Marischal College, of which his father had become principal in 1717. He graduated AM in 1718 and was presented to the chair of Greek at Marischal in 1723. He went on to teach a number of important figures including a future principal, George Campbell, Alexander Gerard, and James Beattie, and was an important influence on the poet James Macpherson, the compiler of <span class="italic">Ossian</span>. In October 1748 Blackwell was appointed principal of Marischal College, and introduced a programme of reforms to modernize the curriculum, including a new class taught by himself in ancient history, geography, and chronology. He married Barbara Black (<i>d</i>. 1793), daughter of an Aberdeen merchant, probably in 1749; they had no children. In 1752 he took the degree of doctor of laws. As principal, Blackwell was active in promoting the union of Marischal and King's colleges to form a single university in Aberdeen, a project which came to fruition in the fusion of 1860.<br>
<br>Blackwell's main fame is as a writer whose books&#151;<span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer</span> (1735), <span class="italic">Letters Concerning Mythology</span> (1748), and <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Augustus</span> (3 vols., 1753&#150;63)&#151;were pioneering studies in their fields and mark him as a major figure of the Scottish Enlightenment. The <span class="italic">Enquiry</span> was published anonymously in 1735 and went to five subsequent editions. Blackwell considered why Homer had been the supreme epic poet and concluded that his achievement was explicable almost entirely in terms of natural forces. Homer was the outcome of a specific historical context, social organization, geography, and climate, which combined to shape the culture he represented and which provided an ethos uniquely favourable to epic poetry. The argument was that culture was learned, not inherent; it was the basic means of organizing social institutions and was part of a continually changing process&#151;ideas which were to become the cornerstones of modern cultural anthropology. Blackwell distinguished four periods in Greek history: settlement, growth in civilization, cultural maturity, and decline. A key point of the analysis was the idea of uneven development, an overlap between high civilization in the centres of Greek culture, with a continuation of relative barbarism and its attendant heroic values elsewhere. Advances in civilization brought gains in wealth and sophistication, but also introduced artifice and corruption, a loss of the heroic simplicity and clear moral vision that had distinguished earlier periods. Blackwell declared:<blockquote>I am in the case of a noble Historian [Herodotus], who having related the constant Superiority his <i>Greeks</i> had over the Inhabitants of the <i>Assyrian</i> Vales, concludes &#145;That it has not been given by the Gods, to one and the same Country, to produce rich Crops and warlike Men:&#146; Neither indeed does it seem to be given to one and the same Kingdom, to be thoroughly civilized, and afford proper Subjects for Poetry &hellip; Whoever reflects upon the Rise and Fall of States, will find, that along with their Manners, their <i>Language</i> too accompanies them both in their Growth and Decay &hellip; It is the <i>different Periods</i> or Steps, naturally succeeding in the <i>Progression of Manners</i>, that can only account for the Succession of Wit and Literature.  (<span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer</span>, 1735, 26&#150;8, 36, 77)</blockquote>In the early stages of society language was naturally bold and metaphorical, so that utterance had a rude and energetic quality which it later lost. This was fostered by the clannish nature of early Greek society which limited the growth of centralized power. Blackwell considered the latter inimical to high cultural achievement because of its tendency to foster an artificial &#145;courtly&#146; style which checked spontaneity and dampened the vigorous localism and particularity characteristic of early poetry at its best, a point he was to develop in his study of Virgil in <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Augustus</span>. Homer was peculiarly favoured by circumstance, since he had appeared at the beginning of a new cultural phase, but still had personal experience of the old heroic ethos. Although a member of a powerful bardic class, he had been born poor, and could therefore draw upon the rich pool of popular traditions sustained by the common people, which Blackwell regarded as the ultimate source of all literary creativity. Homer had been a strolling bard, a master improviser whose songs had been committed to writing long after his death: the unitary written text being a late development resulting from deliberate editorial intervention in a previously oral process. A set of unique socio-cultural circumstances therefore made Homer's achievement possible, but also unrepeatable.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Letters Concerning Mythology</span> was published, also anonymously, in 1748. The earlier of the nineteen letters came from another hand, but Blackwell completed numbers seven and eight and wrote the remainder of the series. For almost two millennia the mythology of the ancient world had been attacked by Euhemeristic critics who regarded it as a fabulous form of history and saw the gods as deified priests and kings; by Christian apologists to whom the gods were thinly disguised demons; and by modern rationalists who dismissed the whole affair as merely absurd. Blackwell took a different view. He saw mythology as a humane and civilizing influence, arguing that the system possessed enduring significance, and concluding that, interpreted with sympathetic regard to its original allegorical intention, it was a major key to the world-picture of classical antiquity. While &#145;the old Divinity&#146; had been accepted quite literally by the vulgar, the wise had treated it as a system of abstractions which dealt with reality in symbolic terms, and these Blackwell set himself to unravel. He cast his net wide, discussing not only obviously &#145;mythical&#146; tales, but also material culture, iconography, ceremonial and ritual, and even proverbial lore, citing an impressive array of learned works in a variety of languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew, and Arabic. He attempted to distinguish between earlier and later myths by studying their transmission through the various host societies. Once later priestly and literary accretions had been identified and eliminated, the original deeply meaningful mythic stratum and the ancient thought patterns it represented could be recovered. It was important at the same time that mythology be related to the actual practice of ancient religions. The original source of the Orphic mysteries lay in Egypt, and the evidence suggested that the original twelve &#145;great gods&#146; of ancient Egypt had been mythic creations from the start&#151;great metaphors of the creation and the ordering of the universe. It seemed clear, too, how these abstractions had gradually become objectified as ideas passed from one culture to another. Blackwell was an early proponent of the numen/nomen theory later championed by Max M&uuml;ller and others, which held that the source of myth lay in a &#145;disease of language&#146;, an intensely figurative habit of expression peculiar to early man which invested everything it touched with metaphoric force resulting in the personification of nature:<blockquote>As the early <i>Egyptian</i> Rites &hellip; were all typical and symbolical, the Type or Symbol came by an easy Transition, not only to signify obscurely, but directly to express the Thing typified &hellip; But besides the original Type, any remarkable part of the divine Service, any mystical Mixture as in the Rites of Ceres, any striking posture as in the Feasts of Pan, any uncouth Garb of the Hierophant or Priest, or any uncouth Quality ascribed to the Numen, was enough to fix an Epithet, and that Epithet to wear gradually into a Name. (<span class="italic">Letters Concerning Mythology</span>, 1748, 189&#150;90)</blockquote>Blackwell viewed early Jewish beliefs in the context of contemporary Near Eastern cosmographies, subjecting the account of creation in the book of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> to comparative analysis with ancient Phoenician texts, and discounting the conventional view of the scriptures as embodying the primal religion of which all the others, with the exception of Christianity, were in varying degrees corruptions. He traced the transformation of Chaldean monotheism into polytheism, as the stars began to be worshipped as lesser deities, demonstrating not only that this had happened, but how it had come about. He was even prepared to explain, if not altogether to defend, priapism and phallic worship. Throughout his wide-ranging and subtle study the basic assumption was that the past was coherent, that its correct interpretation was not only of crucial importance to an enlightened understanding of what it meant to be human, but that, viewed in its own terms, it all made perfect sense.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Augustus</span> (3 vols., 1753&#150;63), Blackwell disavowed any intention as a mere annalist, presenting himself as a practitioner of intellectual history, what he called &#145;This difficult Science of Men&#146;  (T. Blackwell, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Augustus</span>, 1.5). He discussed how people existed in and were defined by society, and went on to explore the forces that had transformed Rome from an obscure Italian hamlet into a great imperial power. The city had been founded in Spartan military virtue and for a long time its government had been popular and democratic, but the constitution was flawed: everything turned upon the quality of the political culture, and if republican virtue waned there was little to prevent an irresistible slide into tyranny. Insufficient separation of powers meant that if the army went bad&#151;and it did&#151;then everything else went with it. The villain of the piece was Julius Caesar who<blockquote>dared to point his Sword at his Parent's Throat. He besieged her Towns, trampled upon her Laws, cut off her Consuls, slew her Pretors, pursued her Senators from city to city, and land to land, until he set his unhallowed foot on the Neck of Freedom, and laid Rome's Glory in the Dust. (ibid., 1.192)</blockquote>A balanced constitution was therefore the indispensable foundation of enduring political success, a lesson underlined by comparative surveys of France, Venice, and the Spanish empire. Blackwell explored how behaviour patterns were moulded by power relations, and in a study of Virgil and Horace demonstrated how the arts were responsive to the political ethos in which they functioned and how they might influence it in turn. This was set within a detailed and racy political history of the later republic and early imperial period from a writer well acquainted with power, and how the greatest of enterprises could be compromised by human weakness, vice, and folly. In Blackwell's urbane and witty pages one might learn how at a meeting of the senate, Cato&#151;to his horror&#151;intercepted a billet-doux to Caesar from his own sister; how the rake Pollio's travelling baggage contained a matching set of nude statues of some half-dozen of the loveliest matrons in Rome, done from the life; how Antony made public love to the actress Cytheris in a golden chariot drawn by lions, an act made doubly offensive to good taste by the fact that she was not even a tragedienne.<br>
<br>Blackwell's contemporary reputation was very considerable, and for nearly half a century he was regarded as the foremost Homeric critic in Europe. But his championship of the Franco-Scots <i>galant</i> style, his evident links with a cosmopolitan pan-European intellectual tradition, and his thoroughly Scottish whig politics provoked bitterly hostile criticism from nationalistically minded English commentators like Samuel Johnson. As Scotland lost ground within the union during the nineteenth century, Blackwell was gradually assigned to the legion of the lost whose works it was permissible not to read. There were stirrings of revival during the twentieth century as classical scholars began to re-explore the history of their subject under the influence of the oral-formulaic theories of the American Homeric scholars Milman Parry and Albert Lord whose work he had partly anticipated, but the full range of Blackwell's achievement has yet to be acknowledged. Blackwell died of a consumptive illness in Edinburgh on 6 March 1757.<br>
