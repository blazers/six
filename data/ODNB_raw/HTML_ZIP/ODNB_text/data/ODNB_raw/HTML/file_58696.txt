<span class="headword">Stephen,  Margaret</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1765&#150;1795), <span class="occ">midwife and teacher of midwifery</span>, lived at 42 Ely Place, Holborn, London. Nothing is known about her origins or married life aside from the fact that she was the mother of nine children. There are indications of an education and background befitting a gentlewoman: Stephen's own competence in &#145;foreign&#146; languages, and her insistence that midwifery was a suitable occupation for &#145;well-educated&#146; and respectable women who have fallen on hard times  (Stephen, 5, 18).<br>
<br>Stephen's importance stems from the fact that she was the author of one of the very few books on midwifery written by a woman in the eighteenth century. In addition, she was offering instruction to women at a time when the traditional system of ecclesiastical licensing and training had long ceased and male midwives had, for the most part, assumed control of the training and supervision of midwives. Stephen herself had been taught by a pupil of William Smellie, the well-known male midwife who had set himself up as a teacher of midwifery in the 1740s. In all likelihood, Stephen was instructed by John Harvie, who took over Smellie's teaching role on his retirement from his London practice in 1759 and who inherited his &#145;apparatus&#146;, used in lectures for demonstrating various aspects of child delivery  (Peachey, 62).<br>
<br>Stephen's curriculum of instruction included anatomy, correction of malpresentations, and the use of forceps. She required her female pupils to take notes of her lectures which eventually comprised a pocket-sized volume that they could carry to labours. Such was her self-confidence in her teaching that she stated her pupils were &#145;as well qualified as men&#146; in their practice. In her book <span class="italic">The Domestic Midwife</span>, published in London in 1795, she noted her use of a &#145;machine&#146; for instructing her female pupils in the correct use of forceps in the rare instance when they might be required to save the life of a mother. The recurring theme of her book, however, written from her own experience of more than thirty years, is a critique of the overuse of forceps, particularly by young, inexperienced male practitioners. A strong advocate for female midwives Stephen condemned male midwives for unjustly maligning their female counterparts, whom they charged more for instruction than aspiring male candidates. At the same time, Stephen argued, the male instructors withheld knowledge from these women and then accused them of ignorance and incompetence.<br>
<br>In an era which had espoused &#145;scientific&#146; knowledge and Enlightenment values, Stephen's book maintained the integrity of women's traditional knowledge with its emphasis on experience. The articulate and intelligent Stephen, however, augmented women's practical experience with instruction in anatomy and the emergency instruments associated with male practice. The date of her death is unknown.<br>
