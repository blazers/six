<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farquhar,  George</span>  (1676/7&#150;1707), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in Londonderry, one of seven children of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated under a schoolmaster named Walker. His wife later claimed that he served as a volunteer under Colonel Hans Hamilton at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, although he was then a mere thirteen years old. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 17 July 1694 at the age of seventeen as a sizar, that is, one who served at table in exchange for food and lodgings. In May 1695 he received an exhibition of &pound;4 a year, which was suspended when he and some other students behaved inappropriately at Donnybrook fair, but restored in February 1696. His formal education ended abruptly: according to early accounts he was dismissed for a profane witticism when asked to write about the miracle of walking on water.<h2>
<a name="EarlytheatricalcareerinDublinandLondon"></a>Early theatrical career in Dublin and London</h2>By 1696 Farquhar had joined the acting company in the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, but stage fright and a weak voice hampered his performances. He is said to have played Young Bellair in George Etherege's <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, Careless in Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Committee</span>, Young Loveless in Francis Beaumont's and John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span>, and other roles. After two seasons he left Smock Alley when, as Guyomar in John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span>, he forgot to exchange his sword for a foil and consequently injured the actor playing Vasquez. At Smock Alley Farquhar had met Robert Wilks, the actor who was later to bring his comic heroes to life on the London stage. According to biographers, Wilks suggested that Farquhar leave acting and write comedy.<br>
<br>In 1697 or 1698 Farquhar headed for London, probably with a draft of his first play, <span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span>, in hand. He fell ill along the way, a circumstance referred to in his two works of 1698, <span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span> and a novella called <span class="italic">The Adventures of Covent Garden</span>. Frequent bouts of illness marked both his life and his writings. Farquhar perhaps suffered from rheumatic fever; he often wrote of long and debilitating fevers, rheumatism, and aching extremities, particularly hands so excruciatingly painful that sometimes he could not hold a quill.<br>
<br>The hero of <span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span>, a young Irishman freshly arrived in London and devilishly successful with the ladies, has generally been accepted as self-referential; the poet Lyrick says in the play that the hero &#145;is always the Poet's Character&#146;. Farquhar was a handsome young man, a frequenter of such haunts as The Rose tavern near the theatre, attracted by and attractive to women, witty, and good-humoured. He painted an epistolary picture of himself, published in <span class="italic">Love and Business</span> (1701), as a melancholy yet amorous and inconstant person. He viewed himself as Epicurean in his tastes and a lover of ease; people liked him because he was not pretentious, malicious, or angry by nature. He had very little estate except for:<blockquote>what lies under the Circumference of my Hat. &hellip; I ought to thank Providence that I can by Three Hours Study live One and Twenty with Satisfaction my self, and contribute to the Maintenance of more Families than some who have Thousands a Year. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.352)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span>, embellished with songs and dances, opened very probably in early December 1698, and had a successful run. It was published on 29 December. <span class="italic">The Adventures of Covent Garden</span> was published anonymously on 15 December (but dated 1699), and was supposedly loosely based on Antoine Fureti&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le roman bourgeois</span> (1666), translated as <span class="italic">Scarron's City Romance</span> (1671). Farquhar, a man of rare creativity and great productivity, seldom borrowed lines from others but often recycled his own plot ideas and lines of poetry; the romance is attributable to him because of materials he reused in <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>.<h2>
<a name="FamewithTheConstantCouple1699"></a>Fame with The Constant Couple, 1699</h2>By spring or summer 1699 Farquhar was writing <span class="italic">The Constant Couple, or, A Trip to the Jubilee</span>, the comedy that made him famous. In it he developed the character of Sir Harry Wildair, played to perfection by his friend Robert Wilks, who afterwards went by the sobriquet of that character; a second actor, Henry Norris, came to be known as Jubilee Dicky from his comic servant in the same play. Farquhar created a new kind of rakish hero, less extravagant and foppish, more believably human, a known war hero. During rehearsals or the early run, act <span class="smallcap">V</span> scene i was almost entirely rewritten to reduce sentimentality and make Sir Harry's airy, flippant character consistent to the end. The comedy opened in November 1699 and had an unprecedented run of fifty-three nights in London and a reported twenty-three in Dublin in its first season, a record that remained unbroken until John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> played sixty-two times in London in 1728&#150;9. The young playwright's talents were proven; at twenty-one years old, he was by far the season's most successful playwright.<br>
<br>In a time of unquestioning adherence to neo-classical principles, the critics fumed at the audiences' delight in this very modern comedy. Critics and Farquhar himself gave Wilks the credit for the phenomenal success, but it was Farquhar's creation of Sir Harry as well as Wilks's portrayal of him that changed the nature of comedic heroes. The play was published on 11 December 1699 with the date 1700, and on 1 February the second edition appeared. The comedy became a perennial favourite in the theatres, invariably known by its subtitle, the <span class="italic">Trip to the Jubilee</span>; it ran more than 400 times in the eighteenth century, with its greatest popularity, after the premi&egrave;re season, in the 1730s and 1740s. Sir Harry, always a favourite role for actors, became a favourite breeches part for women, most notably Peg Woffington, who performed the role seventy-three times between 1740 and 1757.<br>
<br>Farquhar stayed busy about the theatre that season, writing prologues and epilogues. One night he heard sixteen-year-old Anne Oldfield reading <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span> behind the bar of her uncle's Mitre tavern in St James's market. He admired her reading so much, so the story goes, that he recommended her to the playwright John Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh then introduced her to Christopher Rich, who hired her as an actress at Drury Lane. She had not yet become a featured actress when <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span> opened, but she took over the role of Lurewell after the reigning actress, Susannah Verbruggen, died in childbirth.<br>
<br>Farquhar attended John Dryden's funeral on 13 May 1700 with some bemusement; he described the extravagant pomp and ceremony in a letter in <span class="italic">Love and Business</span>. On 7 August 1700 he sailed for the Netherlands, where he stayed until after 23 October. Again he suffered &#145;a very tedious Fit of Sickness, which had almost sent your Friend a longer Journey than he was willing to undertake at present&#146;, but he managed to write interesting travel and love letters  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.320).<br>
<br>Back in London, Farquhar wrote a sequel, <span class="italic">Sir Harry Wildair</span>, to cash in on the runaway popularity of <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>. It opened, probably in April 1701, with the popular actors continuing in their original roles; it was published on 13 May. A marriage comedy, as sequels inevitably were, it featured Sir Harry Wildair as a relapsed rake, suffering the boredom of marriage to a chaste wife and tricked by his spouse to shock him back into matrimonial bliss. The play realized mild success but then disappeared from the theatres for thirty-six years.<br>
<br>Although Farquhar's genius lay in comedy, he dabbled in many other genres. During the spring and summer of 1701 he published letters and poems in several miscellanies. The correspondence included exchanges between Farquhar and dramatist Susanna Carroll, later Centlivre, as Damon and Astraea. By 3 July he had signed an agreement with Bernard Lintott for his own &#145;Letters and Poems&#146;, actually published on 22 November with the date 1702 as <span class="italic">Love and Business: &hellip; a Discourse Likewise upon Comedy in Reference to the English Stage</span>. Farquhar pulled together any scraps he could find to fill out the miscellany, early poems, written while he was still a student, as well as others clearly written after he went to London. Letters, several written from Holland, included romantic ones to Anne Oldfield (his &#145;Penelope&#146;) and the widow Margaret Pemell; there was an epilogue for Catharine Trotter's <span class="italic">The Fatal Friendship</span>.<h2>
<a name="Annoyingthecritics"></a>Annoying the critics</h2>But it was the <span class="italic">Discourse upon Comedy</span> that evoked the outrage of Farquhar's detractors. Farquhar audaciously attacked Aristotle, Scaliger, Vossius, and all the lesser critics who followed Aristotle's &#145;fixt and immutable&#146; rules of poetry, as well as the modern playwrights who were &#145;hoodwink'd&#146; into obeisance. He had no patience for the unities of time, place, and action or for the playwrights and critics who blindly followed them. The attack on neo-classical tenets was shockingly forthright; coming from a young newcomer so unforgivably successful with audiences, it infuriated the critics.<br>
<br>Farquhar usually wrote easily and rapidly, but the afterpiece <span class="italic">The Stage-Coach</span> proved agonizing. This was the only dramatic work for which he had a collaborator, Peter Anthony Motteux, a French dramatist on the English stage, and it was his only attempt at translation, an Anglicization of Jean de la Chapelle's <span class="italic">Les carrosses d'Orl&eacute;ans</span>. Farquhar disliked the task, being accustomed neither to collaboration nor to translation. It opened between autumn 1700 and February 1702 at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was the only dramatic piece that Farquhar ever wrote for Thomas Betterton's troupe. Afterpieces, which supplemented full-length plays in extended programmes, were still a rarity, and no record of the first run exists, but throughout the years audiences loved it. It ran in London on 182 known occasions and probably many other times not recorded. In 1730, two years after John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> took London by storm, <span class="italic">The Stage-Coach</span> was transformed into a ballad opera at Goodman's Fields. The farce was not published immediately after the first run; it was probably considered too inconsequential and even too short for separate publication. Eventually three distinct texts, from three different manuscripts, appeared, the first in Dublin in 1704 when Farquhar was there, the second, perhaps from Motteux in London in 1705, and the third, probably a playhouse copy, in Farquhar's <span class="italic">Works</span> dated 1736.<br>
<br>Farquhar next chose to adapt Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chase</span> (1652). In <span class="italic">The Inconstant</span> he cut the number of characters, invented new dialogue, and changed the plot line almost entirely in the last half of the play. Although translations and adaptations were the stock-in-trade of contemporaneous playwrights, Farquhar's originality was irrepressible even when he tried to adapt a work; after <span class="italic">The Inconstant</span> he never tried again.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Inconstant</span> opened at Drury Lane in February 1702 with a prologue by Motteux. Wilks once again played the lead. Even before it opened, it was vilified by the critics, still seething over the <span class="italic">Discourse upon Comedy</span>. Nevertheless, the comedy ran six successive nights, and might have proved hardier except for the death of King William on 8 March. It did not play again for fourteen years, but from the 1730s it continued in the repertory throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Twin-Rivals</span> followed ten months later. A very different kind of comedy, perhaps influenced by the success of Richard Steele's sentimental <span class="italic">The Funeral</span> a year earlier, it opened on 14 December 1702. Like Steele's comedy, it dealt with serious crimes, a stolen inheritance and attempted rape; the stakes are far higher than those of the usual drawing-room comedies of the period. The critics attacked the play even before it opened, and the first run was disappointing. Farquhar by now had produced the extraordinarily successful <span class="italic">Constant Couple</span> followed by one successful but inconsequential afterpiece and three comedies received tepidly by audiences and savagely by critics. For more than three years he wrote no new plays.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandthearmy"></a>Marriage and the army</h2>Farquhar was reputed to have had numerous liaisons, including ones with Susanna Carroll and Anne Oldfield. Probably some time in 1703 he married Margaret Pemell, a widow, older than he, with three children. She tricked him, it is said, into believing she was rich, but after the vows he discovered the truth. He fathered two daughters. Despite Margaret's deception, he remained loyal to her until the end.<br>
<br>Whether motivated by his familial responsibilities or his theatrical disappointments, in 1704 Farquhar secured a lieutenancy as a grenadier in the earl of Orrery's regiment raised for service in Ireland. By summer he was recruiting, perhaps in Shrewsbury. Recruiting was a risky enterprise since the standard pay was very low; officers sometimes had to supplement it out of their own pockets; if the men deserted, the officers were personally liable for the levy money. Having raised troops, Farquhar was sent to Dublin, where his brother was a bookseller. Hoping to recoup his recruiting losses, he arranged with Smock Alley to perform the role of Sir Harry Wildair in <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, and reportedly his benefit earned him &pound;100. By autumn 1705 there was a new need for troops, and Farquhar may have been sent back to England on another recruiting tour. According to Orrery, Farquhar was assiduous in raising the regiment &#145;to the great prejudice of his family&#146;, that is, at his own expense  (Sutherland, 171).<br>
<br>Although Farquhar's wife claimed that he remained an officer until he died, the biographers tell a sadder story. Farquhar applied to the duke of Ormond, lord lieutenant of Ireland, for preferment and was promised a captaincy if he relinquished his commission as lieutenant. He obligingly did so, but then was gravely disappointed when the captain's commission was given to another. He returned to London, desperate for money. That winter he tried his hand at an epic on the battle of Barcelona in 1705. The epic was a genre for which he totally lacked talent, and he never published this attempt, either because he found it unworthy or perhaps because its hero, Charles Mordaunt, earl of Peterborough, had fallen from the Queen's favour.<h2>
<a name="Finalmonths"></a>Final months</h2>By February 1706 Farquhar had a mere fifteen months to live, yet during this period he produced his two best-known, liveliest comedies, <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> and <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>. Duped into marriage and familial obligations, tricked out of his military commission, melancholy by nature, reviled by critics, he transcended his difficulties to create two of the most spirited and good-natured comedies on the British stage.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> clearly reflected Farquhar's own experience. Local citizens claimed the characters were based on people he knew in Shrewsbury; the hero, Plume, of course played by Wilks, was considered yet another rendering of the author himself; for the first time Anne Oldfield, as Silvia, acted in one of Farquhar's premi&egrave;res. The opening on 8 April 1706 at Drury Lane produced an immediate and enthusiastic response; the comedy ran ten nights despite the fact that it opened so late in the season. By the next year both houses were performing it, and thereafter it became one of the most popular plays on stage, running 512 times in London during the century. In the 1730s it was acted at four to six houses every year, and it was reportedly the first play ever staged in Australia, performed by convicts in 1789. Even the critics grudgingly admired <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, admitting that Farquhar's comedies played well on stage. He was recognized for his freshness and good nature. The comedy was published on about 25 April 1706 and frequently republished; more than fifty editions appeared in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Eleven months later, on 27 January 1707, Lintott paid Farquhar &pound;30 for another manuscript, at that point called &#145;The Broken Beaux&#146;, but later called <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> on stage and <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> in print. Farquhar also published a bagatelle early in 1707, <span class="italic">Love's Catechism</span>, a flirtatious secular catechism later echoed by Archer and Cherry in the new comedy. He finished his masterpiece during his final illness. One florid biographer depicted him lying ill and penniless in his lodgings when Wilks, noticing he had not been to the theatre for more than two months, sought him at his old address in York Buildings and discovered he had moved. Finding him ill in a back garret in St Martin's Lane, Wilks suggested he write a comedy, and left him some money. Farquhar, only weeks from death, then wrote his sprightliest and most humane comedy.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> opened on 8 March 1707 at the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, to which many of the Drury Lane actors had defected. Wilks as Archer and Oldfield as Mrs Sullen joined others who had regularly appeared in Farquhar's plays. The comedy was immediately successful, and the theatres competed shamelessly by running other Farquhar comedies against it. It played 632 times during the eighteenth century, 194 times as benefits for actors and others, who picked the most popular plays to assure good receipts. It was published on 28 March 1707; more than fifty editions appeared during the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>But Farquhar was probably too ill to care. Contemporaries said he died of a broken heart brought on by Ormond's failure to produce a captain's commission, and indeed his heart may have been to blame for his early demise. The symptoms which afflicted him at least all his adult life suggest a condition which could have led to rheumatic heart disease or bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart valve which causes an invariably fatal decline over a few months. He certainly seemed aware he would not recover.<br>
<br>Farquhar was reportedly visited by Wilks after <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span> opened and told that Oldfield had complained of Mrs Sullen's being too loosely used since she went with Archer before she was divorced from Sullen. Farquhar suggested Wilks tell her to marry him, and in a fortnight she would be a widow in earnest. He died soon after and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 23 May 1707.<br>
<br>Farquhar's wife, Margaret, widowed a second time and left with four small children including his two young daughters, never gave up using his fame to improve her own fortune. She petitioned the queen for redress for her two lost husbands, both of whom had served in the military. She published the epic <span class="italic">Barcelona</span>, even with apparent gaps in the text, and she dedicated it to the earl of Peterborough, now restored to favour. There were also charity benefits for Farquhar's daughters as late as 1750.<br>
<br>With his last two plays, Farquhar finally got recognition appropriate to his achievements. His entire career had spanned a mere eight and a half years. Seven comedies, an afterpiece, a novella, a miscellany, a discourse on comedy, poems, songs, prologues, and epilogues, not to mention a military career, marriage, and parenthood were comprehended in that short span. As a playwright, measured by number of performances and editions throughout the century, he won incomparable popularity, and his plays continue to be performed and read three centuries later. He influenced comedy with believable characters, fallible and funny, humanly inconsistent, foolish and endearing. His extravagant rakes were impetuous but likeable; his women were full of spirit and intelligence. The characters became so familiar that they inevitably shaped other characters written for the same actors and deeply influenced eighteenth-century comedy. After his death critics finally admitted that he had a &#145;genius&#146; for comedy, that he was, as Dr Samuel Johnson said, &#145;a man whose writings have considerable merit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>, ed. R. W. Chapman, 1953, 1070).<br>
