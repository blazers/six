<span class="headword">Zulueta, Sir  Philip Francis  de</span>  (1925&#150;1989), <span class="occ">civil servant and businessman</span>, was born in Oxford on 2 January 1925, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37089/', "Francis (Francisco Maria Jos&#233;) de Zulueta (1878&#150;1958)")</script>, regius professor of civil law and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and his wife, Marie Louise (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of Henry Alexander Lyne Stephens. His childhood was spent in Oxford, where his parents had a house in Norham Road. His father was of distinguished Spanish descent and a cousin of Cardinal Merry de Val, secretary of state at the Vatican, but took British nationality in order to fight in the First World War. De Zulueta was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, and at the Roman Catholic Beaumont College, from where he won a scholarship to New College, Oxford. After taking a wartime second class in modern history in 1943 he joined the Welsh Guards in the same year and served with the regiment in north-west Europe until 1947, participating in the liberation of Brussels with the guards armoured division; he attained the rank of captain. Thus did he gain early experience of two institutions to which he was to remain loyal throughout his life: the brigade of guards and the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Having returned to New College in 1947 de Zulueta studied jurisprudence but found it hard to settle down to study after the war, and in 1948 he left with a third-class degree. After Oxford he read for the bar with the encouragement of his father, who was a strong influence on him. However, he decided not to proceed with his legal studies and joined the foreign service in 1949, serving in Moscow from 1950 to 1952 as private secretary to the ambassador, Sir David Kelly. On his return to London he became resident clerk at the Foreign Office; then in 1955 he began his long association with three prime ministers, when Sir Anthony Eden took him to 10 Downing Street as one of his two private secretaries for foreign affairs. Also in 1955 he married Marie-Louise, daughter of James Bryan George Hennessy, second Baron Windlesham (1903&#150;1962); they had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>De Zulueta soon showed great aptitude for this work for Eden, and after Harold Macmillan became prime minister in 1957 he was the only representative of the Foreign Office among the private secretaries. He stayed on with Sir Alec Douglas-Home from October 1963 to October 1964 but of all his masters it was Macmillan with whom he built up the greatest rapport, admiring his style of government, intellect, and wit and accompanying him often on foreign tours. Macmillan came to depend upon de Zulueta's loyalty, calm in a crisis, knowledge of the main foreign-policy issues of the time, and linguistic ability, and used him as an interpreter at several of his meetings with Charles de Gaulle. &#145;Philip knows my mind&#146;, he observed, and he remarked teasingly on de Zulueta's gravitas, determination, and strength of personality, for with the intelligence and fundamental kindness came a tendency to be impatient with the foolish or the slow. In Macmillan's resignation honours list of 1963 de Zulueta was given a knighthood.<br>
<br>In 1964, having always been interested in financial affairs and feeling that a diplomatic posting might be an anticlimax after his years in 10 Downing Street, de Zulueta left the Foreign Office for the City. There he spent a six-month training period before joining Philip Hill-Higginson Erlangers. He was a director of the newly merged Hill Samuel from 1965 to 1972. In 1973 he joined Antony Gibbs Holdings, serving as chief executive from 1973 to 1976 and as chairman from 1976 to 1981. He was made chairman of Tanks Consolidated Investments in 1983 and a director of the Belgian Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale when that company took over Tanks in 1982. In 1984 he became a director of Abbott Laboratories of Chicago. Among his outside interests were the Franco-British Council, the Institute of Directors, and the Trilateral Commission. Increasingly he suffered from serious heart trouble.<br>
<br>De Zulueta was extremely hard-working and energetic, deriving much self-confidence from an exceptionally happy family life. Tall, dark-haired, thickset, always immaculately dressed, quiet of voice, and often leaning forward slightly in a rather courtly way to catch every nuance of the conversation, he also had an urbane, formidable presence and high standards; the morality and certainty of his strong religious faith never left him. Beneath this exterior, however, lay humour and sympathy, qualities particularly evident at his homes in London and later at Eastergate House in Sussex, where he was a relaxed and generous host. In 1984 he became an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>De Zulueta died on 15 April 1989 on board a British Airways flight, when returning from a business trip to the United States; he had a fatal coronary thrombosis as the aeroplane was coming in to land at London. A thanksgiving mass was celebrated at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London, on 22 May 1989.<br>
