<span class="headword">Boothby, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> 1707), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was baptized on 9 November 1637 at Broadlow Ashe, the son of the landowner and royalist Henry Boothby (<i>d</i>. 1648), of Clater Close, Oxfordshire, who was nominated first baronet during the civil war in 1644 but whose patent never passed the great seal, and his wife, Mary Hayes. Boothby inherited his father's estate in 1648, but little else is known of his early years. He was created baronet by Charles II, by letters patent dated 13 July 1660, and led an active life as a notable figure among the Derbyshire landed gentry, serving as county sheriff in 1661&#150;2 and on the grand jury in the assizes of 1682. In 1671 he bought Ashbourne Hall, Derbyshire, and the manor of Ashbourne from the poet Sir Aston Cokayne (1608&#150;1684). Boothby married twice, his first wife, Frances Milward, whom he married in 1653, dying a year later after presenting him with a son, Francis 
    (Frank; <i>d</i>. 1684)
  . In 1657 he married Hill Brooke (1640&#150;1704), the second daughter and eventually sole heir of Sir William Brooke, the nephew and heir of Henry Brooke, eleventh Lord Cobham. She was the object of his great affection, as is clear from his later diary comments on what a &#145;Jewell&#146; and &#145;Treasure&#146; she was, whose &#145;sweet and good society&#146; he enjoyed for so long. They had nine children over the next thirteen years.<br>
<br>Boothby would be remembered no more than any other midland landowner, gentleman farmer, and local dignitary of his time but for a series of his diaries and letter-books, written between 1676 and 1689, which came fully to light in the 1990s among the muniments of Fonmon Castle, Glamorgan, whither later generations of the Boothby family migrated through marriage into the Jones family. Besides documenting something of his relationship with his neighbour (8 miles away), the poet and translator Charles Cotton (1630&#150;1687), and providing a glimpse of the provincial literary community to which they belonged, these four manuscript volumes (acquired in 1995 by the British Library) reveal in vivid and extensive detail, possibly unique of its kind, the predominant intellectual and recreational passion of Boothby's life, which was book collecting. &#145;My Books are the great joy of my life&#146;, he declared in a letter to Cotton on 21 July 1685. The result was years of book buying from a series of dealers, both in London and the midlands&#151;his regular suppliers including Michael Johnson (1656&#150;1731) in Lichfield and Richard Chiswell (1639&#150;1711) in London&#151;whom he frequently harangued for more information about current publications and whose attentions to his demands he often found woefully inadequate. He was a religious man and his tastes inclined especially to theology and ecclesiastical debate, but incorporated a wide spectrum of other categories, including literature, politics, science, medicine, history, travel, law, and rhetoric, as well as bibliography itself, books on miscellaneous social topics (such as marriage), and a variety of prints, maps, atlases, and dictionaries. He gave specific instructions for the binding he wanted on his books, and his frequent dissatisfaction with the results adds to the impression that dealers found him at times a difficult and perhaps cantankerous client. Boothby died at Ashbourne Hall on 24 March 1707, and was buried three days later at St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. He was succeeded by his grandson Sir Henry Boothby (1682&#150;1710).<br>
<br>The ultimate result of Boothby's bibliomania was a library which, according to his memorial, numbered at his death &#145;near six Thousand Books&#146;. This library, which occupied at least 122 shelves, is, in fact, extensively listed by subject in &#145;A catalogue of all the books in the inner library at Ashburne-Hall, collected by S<sup>r</sup> Will<sup>m.</sup>: Boothby K<sup>t</sup>: and baronet &hellip; 1715&#146;, a 57-leaf folio manuscript still preserved at Fonmon Castle. Apart from compiling this catalogue, his son Brooke Boothby (1670&#150;1727), who erected a grand monument to him in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne, is not known to have inherited his father's passion, but it seems that his grandson, another Brooke Boothby, the fifth baronet (1710&#150;1789), did so, ordering (according to Samuel Pegge) &#145;<i>every</i> book that was published to be sent to him&#146;  (J. Nichols, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester</span>, 4, 1807, 179). A tribute to this later, expanded library appears in Ellis Farneworth's preface to <span class="italic">The Life of Pope Sixtus the Fifth &hellip; Translated from &hellip; Gregorio Leti</span> (1754). Nevertheless, it seems that the Boothby library was sold before the year 1776 and was subsequently dispersed. Several dozen books bearing Boothby's signature (&#145;Will: Boothby&#146;), with occasional pressmarks or notes on prices paid for binding, sometimes in his original characteristic bindings of calf with lion's paw crest in gilt, have come to light (in the British Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, the Beinecke Library, Yale University, the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, the University Library, Durham, and elsewhere), and no doubt more will do so in the future.<br>
