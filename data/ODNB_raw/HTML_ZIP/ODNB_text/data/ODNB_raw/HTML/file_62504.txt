<span class="headword">Pallis,  Alexander</span>  (1850&#150;1935), <span class="occ">cotton merchant and translator</span>, was born Alexandros Alexandrou Palles on 15 March 1850 at Piraeus, Greece, the youngest child in the family of three sons and one daughter of Alexandros Anastasiou Pales, later Palles (1808/9&#150;1849/50), magistrate, descended from Epirot landowners, and his wife, Panagiotitsa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kouskouri (1815/16&#150;1908), from Mystras. His elder brothers became respectively governor of the Bank of Greece and aide-de-camp to King George I of Greece. Pallis's maternal aunt Polytimi wrote a successful geography of classical Greece (1854).<br>
<br>Born after his father's death, Pallis grew up in Athens's Albanian quarter, the Plaka, revering his dour, chain-smoking mother, who was a superb natural storyteller, and learning to prize the unaffected language in which, an eyewitness to Ioannis Kapodistrias's murder, she recalled her refugee childhood. He began a course in literature at the University of Athens in 1869, but after a few weeks was whisked off to Manchester, with a blessing and a &pound;5 note, in order to rescue a small calico business jeopardized by his uncle's death. His canny trading impressed the head of a firm of Chiot cotton importers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39298/', "Pandias Ralli (Rallis)")</script>, who offered him a clerkship with excellent prospects, provided he &#145;married into the family&#146;.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1875, Ralli Bros shipped Pallis out to Bombay, posting him directly to an up-country buying agency. His punctiliousness, adaptability, and extraordinary stamina (the average lifespan of his mother, himself, his children, and his grandchildren, excepting one child who died in infancy, was ninety) won him promotion to Bombay branch manager, with his own Malabar Hill bungalow and servants. India's flora and civilization enthralled him, and his zest for travel took him to almost every place of interest in the subcontinent. No great mixer with the English, he held literary court for Greeks, gaining two other Ralli box-wallahs as allies: the poet Eftaliotis, and Pallis's future son-in-law Petros Vlastos (Peter Vlasto). When on furlough in Liverpool, on 30 December 1881, at Toxteth register office, he married Pandias Ralli's daughter, Julia Pandia Ralli (1857&#150;1940), plain, featherbedded, and devoted&#151;as her husband was not&#151;to classical music. Her &#145;long loveless sacrifice to duty&#146;  (D. Vlasto) produced five offspring: the ecologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60871/', "Marietta Pallis (1882&#150;1963)")</script>, the diplomat and historian Alexander Pallis (1883&#150;1975), Aziza Pallis (1884&#150;1986), who married Peter Vlasto, Andreas Pallis (1888&#150;1977), and <a href="#cosubject_62504">Marco Pallis [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>In 1894, after a brief sojourn (terminated by Julia) on Corfu, and although &#145;he still yearned for retirement in his native land&#146;  (D. Vlasto), Pallis, promoted Liverpool branch manager, entrenched himself on sporting, philistine Merseyside. He took British citizenship in 1897, four months after the catastrophic Greco-Turkish war. A botanist <i>manqu&eacute;</i>, he had purchased, backing onto the 200 acre <i>rus in urbe</i> of Sefton Park, the woodland residence, 20 Aigburth Drive, that he sardonically renamed Tatoi after the Greek royal estate. Its regrettable interior was offset by &#145;a well-used and elegant library&#146;  (D. Vlasto), fine carved furniture, and indiscriminately amassed orientalia (including carpets, weapons, and ceramics). Copying the London Greeks' panache, Pallis affected the pipe and droll stories of the Victorian paterfamilias, joined Liverpool's Reform and Lyceum clubs, and chaired the local branch of the Classical Association. He would rise at seven, walk the three miles to and from the office, work until six, and pursue literary studies after dinner, retiring to bed at one in the morning; on Sundays he would read his family the appointed gospel in his own demotic version, before their attendance at the Greek church. For marital and other jaunts he had two cars, each with a chauffeur: a Sizaire-Berwick, in which even the hairbrush was gold-plated, and a vintage Mercedes, succeeded by a funereal Daimler complete with worry-beads. His annual European round of ex-mistresses was diversified with the Dreyfus trial in 1899 and the Paris Expo in 1900. On his eldest son he settled &pound;60,000, on his two younger sons &pound;50,000 apiece, at majority, thus avoiding death duties. (For her &pound;30,000, unbiddable Marietta had to wait until his decease.) He endowed places at Eton College, where his son Alec had been captain of school, for boys from poor or war-stricken families. His children had as good an English education as money could buy, since he meant them to go &#145;home&#146; and set the raw Greeks an example of political skills and administrative honesty.<br>
<br>This late Victorian capitalist and accomplished, if wilful, classical scholar was also a language rebel, a pioneer of the Greek spoken today. The &#145;language question&#146;&#151;than which there was, according to Peter Vlasto, &#145;perhaps no subject more dreary&#146;&#151;confronted a &#145;purist&#146; language (<i>kathar&eacute;vousa</i>), often stilted, but <i>de rigueur</i> in education and literature, with a &#145;people's language&#146; (<i>dimotik&iacute;</i>), purporting to distil folksong and street speech. In &#145;longhair&#146; (that is progressive) periodicals Pallis campaigned playfully and abrasively for <i>dimotik&iacute;</i>, as &#145;the battle of individual culture against collective traditionalism&#146;  (P. Vlasto). Simultaneously, in the best traditions of Epirot mercantile benefaction, he funded deserving young writers liberally, the poet Palamas (who wrote the words to the Olympic hymn) in particular. (Pallis himself congratulated the Greek winner of the 1896 Olympic marathon in verse.) His original poems, where not caustic, have a Carrollian charm: he wrote attractively for children. His translations, manifestos for demotic, included a prose <span class="italic">Merchant of Venice</span> (1894); a disastrous modernization of Kant; and a British astronomy primer. But his masterpiece was an exhilarating demotic ballad rendering of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1904), which Oxford University Press &#145;bestowed an unusual amount of care&#146; in typesetting on India paper, and reckoned &#145;as good a piece of printing as has ever been seen&#146;  (manager of Liverpool Booksellers to Pallis, 24 April 1912).<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1901, against wise advice, Pallis serialized his demotic version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in the Athenian newspaper <span class="italic">Akropolis</span>. The translation was (for his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist) &#145;clear and harmonious&#146;, but once word got round of its imminent publication Pallis was accused of atheism, burlesquing God's word, and, topically, Panslavism. The &#145;gospel riots&#146; (5&#150;12 November) in Athens saw university students&#151;pro-church, anti-monarchist&#151;incited by their lecturers to a then unfamiliar pattern of action: protest marches, vandalism, stoning the police, a mass meeting (disrupted with eight dead), and armed occupation of the university. A month later the translation was publicly burnt, and banned.<br>
<br>Pallis was a republican liberal who considered Cromwell the greatest of all Englishmen. In his fine baritone he lobbied for Venizelos, notably at the Queen's Hall, London, in 1916, when he was chaired by Emmeline Pankhurst. He made a dozen visits to Greece, &#145;free&#146; or &#145;unfree&#146;, a distinction he would have rejected, for he saw Turks, Arvanites (Albanian-Greeks), and Hellenes&#151;a trinity exemplified in himself&#151;as brothers and a single nation in danger of Slav ingestion. His last visit was a leisurely secular pilgrimage into the Agrafa foothills, written up in <i>Brousos</i> (1921), in which wit, learning, and unsparing criticism of Greek foibles clothe a robustly didactic philosophy of life. Other septuagenarian squibs were open letters, to the archbishop of Canterbury on the Dodecanese, and to the pope on fascism.<br>
<br>Imposing, high-spirited, laconic, combative in his likes and dislikes, clubbable, philoprogenitive, princely in giving, Pallis played to perfection the reluctant (but successful) exile. Even on Merseyside he cherished his self-image as Lek the Longhair Arvanite, the warrior descending from the Balkan hills to champion common sense and common language. He died, fortified by the words of Plato's <span class="italic">Phaedo</span>, at his home in Liverpool on 18 March 1935, of uraemia and acute pyelitis. Appropriately the last of him, his ashes, were by his own wish brought from England and interred in Epirus, in the garden of the Philanthropinon monastery on the lake isle at Ioannina.<br>
<br>Pallis's youngest son, <a name="cosubject_62504"></a><span class="headword">Marco Alexander Pallis</span>  (1895&#150;1989), <span class="occ">musician, mountaineer, and metaphysician</span>, was born on 19 June 1895 at Tatoi, Aigburth Drive, Liverpool. His education included a brief spell (1908&#150;10) at Harrow School. During the First World War he served as a second lieutenant in the Grenadiers on the western front, where he was seriously wounded. He then worked as a censor of letters. As Arnold Dolmetsch's guest in 1920 he munificently financed the new workshop at Haslemere, to the early music movement's great benefit, commissioning an entire chest of viols, a spinet, and a harpsichord, all of which he learned to play, and co-founded, with his inseparable friend Richard Nicholson, the Liverpool Consort of Viols. Discovering mountaineering, he equipped and led the 1933 Himalayan expedition to the Gangotri glacier (source of the Ganges). Gentle, compassionate, yet firm, and treating servants as equals, he became an admirer of Gandhi and of the eminent Buddhist traditionalist, Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non. In 1936 he revisited Sikkim-Ladakh, made the abbot of Lachhen his spiritual father, and became a convert to Tibetan Buddhism (as Thubden Tendzin), acquired fluency in Tibetan, meditated upon death and impermanence, and voiced loud opposition to the idea of a British school in Lhasa. His <span class="italic">Peaks and Lamas</span> (1939) skilfully interpreted transcendental Buddhism to Westerners. From 1947 he and Nicholson based themselves in India to give Tibetans warning of the massive impending threat to their culture. When China invaded Tibet in 1950&#150;51 the two men returned to England. Marco continued to perfect his &#145;marriage of wisdom and method&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 June 1989), aiding refugees and creating music, including an opera (never finished) about the Tibetan sage Mila Repa. He died at Eastbury Manor nursing home, Compton, Surrey, on 5 June 1989, following a stroke. He never married.<br>
