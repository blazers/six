<span class="headword">Prothero, Sir  George Walter</span>  (1848&#150;1922), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 14 October 1848 at Charlton, Wiltshire, the eldest of the four sons of the Revd George Prothero, vicar of Clifton upon Teme, Worcestershire, later rector of Whippingham, Isle of Wight, chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria, and canon of Westminster, and his wife, Emma, daughter of the Revd William Money Kyrle of Homme House, Herefordshire, and Whetham House, Wiltshire. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35624/', "Rowland Edmund Prothero")</script> was president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1916 to 1919.<br>
<br>Prothero was educated on the foundation at Eton College and became head of the school. In 1868 he went to King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar; he was awarded the Bell scholarship in 1869, and in 1872 was sixth in the classical tripos. He was elected a fellow of King's in 1872; he also captained his college boat (1870&#150;71). After a short time as assistant master at Eton, he studied at Bonn University, from 1873 to 1874, under von Sybel; there he became familiar with the work of the great German historians of the time. It was at Bonn that Prothero began to develop a strong commitment to what C. H. Firth called &#145;the historical teaching of history&#146;&#151;the view that the distinct, objective, methodological techniques developed by historians had a unique educational value and should therefore be taught as an intrinsic component of every university history course. When Prothero returned to Cambridge in 1875 he persuaded John Seeley, regius professor of history, to allow him to lecture on the newly created history tripos. Seeley agreed on condition that Prothero did so, not on the German history he so admired but on the middle ages, for which the board of historical studies was finding it difficult to find a reliable teacher. Prothero complied, and his <span class="italic">Life and Times of Simon de Montfort</span> (1877) was written as a text to support his lectures. After a year of trying he then succeeded in persuading the King's College educational council to support the new tripos by establishing a college lectureship in history, to which he himself was elected in 1876. His wife, whom he married in 1882, was Mary Frances, daughter of Samuel Butcher, bishop of Meath, and sister of Samuel Henry Butcher and of John George Butcher, later Lord Danesfort. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In May 1884 Prothero was one of five college lecturers to be appointed to the first university lectureships in history, and a year later he was one of a small group who campaigned successfully for the addition to the history tripos of a special subject, which, based on the detailed study of historical source material, was intended to teach students historical techniques. Prothero's chief and most enduring work of scholarship is a compilation, <span class="italic">Select Statutes and other Documents Illustrative of the Reigns of Elizabeth and James I</span> (1894), which was intended for teachers and students of history; it went into four highly influential editions.<br>
<br>In 1894 Prothero was appointed to the newly created chair of modern history at Edinburgh University. In 1899 he accepted the editorship of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, resigned by his brother Rowland, which he held until his death. The <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> was a digest of articles on politics, literature, art, archaeology, philosophy, and religion, but rarely published historical material. Indeed of the eighteen articles written by Prothero himself during his editorship none was on history. No longer a specialist teacher or writer of history, he now took on a new role as a high-profile spokesman for British historical scholarship. He was elected president of the Royal Historical Society (1901&#150;5), fellow of the British Academy (1903), Rede lecturer at Cambridge (1903), Lowell lecturer at Boston University and Schouler lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, USA (1910), Chichele lecturer at Oxford (1915, lectures delivered 1920). He was co-editor of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1901&#150;12) and general editor of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Historical Series</span>. He used his standing in the social and intellectual life of the London of his time to promote ideas of community and co-operation in British historical scholarship, and to help to define a growing sense among historians that they were part of a profession with a clearly defined set of skills and duties, and a career structure. Prothero acted as historical adviser to the Foreign Office between 1917 and 1919, where, working with the intelligence division of the Admiralty, the geographical section of the general staff of the War Office, the war trade intelligence department, and a specially created historical section of the Foreign Office, he edited the handbooks containing the relevant historical, geographical, and economic data supplied to British delegates at the Peace Conference at Versailles in 1919. These 162 handbooks were published in 25 volumes, by HMSO, in 1920. Prothero himself was invited to attend the peace conference in November 1918 but a severe attack of influenza delayed his arrival until February 1919. As a result he was not asked to serve on any of the committees and was rarely consulted. The two historical memoranda he did produce went unread, prompting him to reflect that he felt he was &#145;the fifth wheel in the coach&#146;. In 1920 Prothero was created KBE for his services to the peace effort. He died at his home, 24 Bedford Square, London, on 10 July 1922.<br>
