<span class="headword">Staines,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1277/8), <span class="occ">justice and administrator</span>, may have been born in Staines, Middlesex, where he acquired property in 1254 and 1276, but his origins are otherwise obscure. He was possibly the son of a John of Staines who held property in the city of London, and he had two sisters, of whom it can be said only that one may have been a half-sister, and that one of them was called Margaret. He probably had a university education, however, as he was usually referred to as Master during his professional career. He is recorded as an attorney in several cases in the common bench in the late 1250s and early 1260s, but first appears in royal service in 1262, when he was one of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the lands&#151;extending across several counties&#151;of the late Richard de Clare, sixth earl of Gloucester. He does not reappear in government records until 1267, however, when he was expressly referred to as a royal clerk, working as such on a variety of inquests. During that year he also acted as the keeper of the bishopric of London, which had been taken into the king's hand following the suspension of the Montfortian Henry of Sandwich.<br>
<br>In the years that followed Staines became increasingly involved in the administration of justice. At the end of 1267 he appears to have received his first appointment as a royal justice, on the eyre circuit headed by Nicholas de Turri, and in the following year he was one of the junior justices appointed for an eyre in Cornwall. In 1268&#150;9 he served as itinerant justice in Wiltshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk before being transferred to the court <i>coram rege</i>, or king's bench, in mid-1269. At first he acted as a puisne justice there, but in November of that year he succeeded Robert de Briwes as the court's senior justice. By Easter 1273, however, despite his annual salary having been raised in the previous year from &pound;40 to 100 marks, Staines had been replaced as chief justice of the court by Martin of Littlebury. He remained a puisne justice of king's bench until Easter 1274, when he was transferred to the common bench, where he served until Easter 1276. In the meantime Staines also continued to act as a justice in the localities. About July 1273 he was appointed with Roger of Seaton to take assizes in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, and he was regularly nominated to commissions. One of the last recorded of these, in July 1276, involved inquiring into alleged escapes from the Tower of London.<br>
<br>After his departure from the common bench Staines's career appears to have changed direction somewhat, since he moved to the royal exchequer, being described as chancellor of the exchequer in January 1277. He may have died before the end of that year, and was certainly dead by 18 June 1278, when his executors were ordered to hand over his <i>coram rege</i> and assize rolls. The fact that he was a clerk in minor orders would not have prevented his marrying, but there is no evidence that he did so. In August 1271 Henry III had presented Staines to the living of Bocking in Essex, and in 1272 confirmed a grant made to him of lands in Oxford by a Jew of that town named Jacob; but it is not clear what happened to his estate after his death. No inquisition post mortem survives.<br>
