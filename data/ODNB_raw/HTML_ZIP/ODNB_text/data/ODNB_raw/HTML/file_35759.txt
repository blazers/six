<span class="headword">Ringer,  Sydney</span>  (1835&#150;1910), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born in Norwich, the second of three sons of John Manstripp Ringer, a Norwich tradesman, and his wife, Harriet. His elder brother, John Melancthon, and younger brother, Frederick, were successful merchants in Shanghai and Japan. Ringer was educated at private schools, and after a brief apprenticeship to a doctor in Norwich he entered University College, London, in 1854, to study medicine; he became MB (1860) and MD (1863), and MRCP (1863) and FRCP (1870). At University College Hospital, Ringer became, successively, resident medical officer (1861), assistant physician (1863), physician (1866), and consulting physician (on his retirement in 1900). He was also assistant physician at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital from 1864 until 1869. At University College, Ringer was professor of materia medica, pharmacology, and therapeutics (1862&#150;78), professor of the principles and practice of medicine (1878&#150;87), and Holme professor of clinical medicine (1887&#150;1900). He became a member of the Physiological Society in 1884 and was elected FRS in 1885; and he was an honorary member of the New York Medical Society and a corresponding member of the Academy of Medicine in Paris.<br>
<br>Ringer was the author of <span class="italic">A Handbook of Therapeutics</span> (1869), and <span class="italic">On the Temperature of the Body as a Means of Diagnosis of Phthisis, Measles and Tuberculosis</span> (1865), and he contributed articles to J. R. Reynolds's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (vol. 1, 1886) and to medical and scientific journals. Although a poor lecturer Ringer was an excellent bedside physician and teacher, bringing his knowledge to bear in a systematic and lucid way on the cases presented to him. However, he is best remembered for his research, which was carried out in the physiological laboratory of University College, his love of research probably being first stimulated by William Sharpey, professor of anatomy and physiology at University College, and then by Michael Foster. Ringer studied the effects of drugs and poisons on the tissues of the body; he also studied the clotting of blood, the function of peripheral nerves, and the contraction of muscle. His most important observations were on the effects of a number of ions, including sodium, potassium, and calcium ions, on the contraction of the heart. In particular, he described a solution containing these ions which can sustain living tissues removed from the body. The term &#145;Ringer's solution&#146; is still used widely for such solutions. He also showed the vital role of calcium ions for the contraction of the heart. This work anticipated modern understanding of the physiological importance of these ions, and it was published in a series of papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span> between 1875 and 1895.<br>
<br>Ringer's character was the product of a severe nonconformist upbringing. He was noted for his punctuality, his kindness&#151;which was frequently practical and anonymous&#151;and his love of music. Although physically and mentally vigorous, he was shy, nervous, and socially retiring, and led a simple life. His eminence and outstanding achievements in clinical practice and research were consequences of his ability for rapid thought and the energy he devoted to a life dedicated to his work. His morning hospital visit would conclude with a visit to the physiological laboratory which, to the laboratory assistant, &#145;came not unlike electric shocks, from which he would scarcely have recovered before he would find that it was all over &hellip; a tracing taken, various suggestions made, and off he was again [to the morning's consulting work]&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1384&#150;6). The afternoon would be filled with clinical work, followed, whenever possible, by another visit to the laboratory.<br>
<br>Ringer married Ann (1833&#150;1897), daughter of Henry Brewster Darley (<i>d</i>. 1860), of Aldby Park, in York on 8 August 1867. They had two daughters: Annie (1868&#150;1875), in whose memory they restored the St Mary's Church at Lastingham in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and Hilda. Sydney Ringer died as a result of a stroke on 14 October 1910 at Lastingham, where he was buried with his wife, alongside their daughter Annie, in St Mary's churchyard.<br>
