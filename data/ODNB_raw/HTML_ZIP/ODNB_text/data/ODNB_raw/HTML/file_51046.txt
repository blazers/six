<span class="headword">Galton,  Dorothy Constance</span>  (1901&#150;1992), <span class="occ">university administrator and apiculturist</span>, was born on 14 October 1901 at 66 Rathcoole Avenue, Edmonton, Middlesex, the daughter of Frank Wallace Galton, secretary to the Fabian Society and to Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and his wife, Jessie Jane Townsend, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cottridge. She grew up in a political atmosphere, and was a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party. As a young woman she had critical surgery which deprived her of the ability to have children and altered the shape of her life. She was educated at home before going to secondary school at Wood Green, London, and then to Bedford College, London. She soon decided that university was not for her, and left after a few months, but she developed privately her gifts for the Slavonic languages. She worked for a time in Transport House and then for Count Mihaly Karolyi, the exiled socialist president of Hungary, travelling with the count and his wife to France, where she tasted the aristocratic life and at the same time developed her east European interests.<br>
<br>In 1928 Galton returned to London as secretary to Professor Sir Bernard Pares, who was reputed not to be an easy man to get on with. He was a leading expert on Russia and director from 1922 to 1939 of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, then based at King's College, London. The school was founded in 1915 by Robert Seton Watson and T. G. Masaryk. In 1932 it became an independent university institute with Galton, although lacking a formal academic training, promoted to be its administrative secretary. At the school her gifts for languages and administration, and her warm personality, stood her in good stead, particularly during the difficult years of the Second World War. She was able to make several visits to the Soviet Union, building valuable personal contacts.<br>
<br>In 1939 Pares retired from the directorship, going to live in the USA where he remained until his death in 1949. Galton continued as secretary of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies under his successors Professor William Rose (1939&#150;47) and Dr George Bolsover (1947&#150;75) until her retirement in 1961. During the Second World War part of the school was evacuated to Oxford, with Galton the link between the sections. Onto her capable shoulders fell the work of maintaining an organization that lost its records during the bombing of central London. In 1941 she organized a seminal summer school in Oxford attended by some eighty students and in 1945, at the invitation of the Rockefeller Foundation, she visited several universities in the USA to further the cause of Slavonic studies. It then fell to her to reintegrate the institute as a single unit in London.<br>
<br>Galton's other great interest, beekeeping, commenced in 1954 and was for a time a purely practical activity. Her leaving present from her colleagues at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in 1961 was a honey extractor. After her retirement and move to Norfolk she brought her considerable intellect to bear on research into beekeeping in Russia. It was natural for her to use the resources of the London-based Bee Research Association, whose director, Eva Crane, was another <i>grande dame</i> of the apicultural world. The fruit of her research was published by the association in 1971 as <span class="italic">A Survey of a Thousand Years of Beekeeping in Russia</span>, with a foreword by Professor Robert E. F. Smith. The International Bee Research Association in 1987 awarded her an honorary membership in recognition of her contribution to the Russian section of its library, through the translation of Russian apicultural materials. Her second book, <span class="italic">The Bee-Hive: an Enquiry into its Origins and History</span> (1982), was an entomological study that ranged far beyond the borders of eastern Europe and Russia. Finally, she assembled in her closing years an unpublished study, &#145;Bees, honey and beeswax in early historical times&#146;. Although her books were without doubt her major occupations, she also contributed to the beekeeping press on a wide range of topics, including studies of the Russian wax trade into Kings Lynn, Norfolk.<br>
<br>Galton maintained her political interests until late in life, being active in the local Labour Party and involved with other voluntary bodies. It was an odd turn of the wheel of fortune that in her latter years she, who gave a low priority to wealth, had never owned a home, and had never had a bank account, inherited a house and capital, and thus found herself a minor capitalist. She never married, and died on 27 August 1992 at her home, 3 Hooks Hill Road, Sheringham, Norfolk, of cancer of the stomach. She donated her body to medical research.<br>
