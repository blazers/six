<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Brian <span class="st"> [Bernard]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> after 1559), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was probably born in Dangan in co. Offaly, the eldest son of Cahir O'Connor (<i>d</i>. 1511), chieftain, and his first wife. Cahir was chieftain of the O'Connor Faly sept or clan from 1474 to 1511. The O'Connors emerged as the dominant midland sept in the mid-fifteenth century under the leadership of Cahir's grandfather Calvagh More O'Connor (<i>fl</i>. 1425&#150;1458). Cahir lacked Calvagh's authority and junior O'Connor branches re-emerged as challengers for the lordship. Such discord within the sept attracted the predatory attentions of Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare, who sought to establish Geraldine dominance over the midlands. He had Cahir assassinated in 1511, ousted the ruling O'Connors, and established a client regime under the MacTadhgs (Brian O'Connor's cousins). However, Offaly's minor septs still supported Cahir's family and Brian rose to power during the confinement in England of Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534), from 1519 to 1523. After a brief succession struggle, the details of which are unknown, Brian was accepted by his sept as the O'Connor Faly by mid-1520.<br>
<br>Brian dealt with the prospect of a MacTadhg restoration by supporting Geraldine interests, calculating that Kildare would accept his accession in return for O'Connor backing. In 1520&#150;21 Brian assisted pro-Geraldine attacks on the pale. His strategy worked, and after Kildare's restoration in 1523 he formally became the earl's client, with Con Bacach O'Neill acting as <i>sl&aacute;inte</i> or guarantor. Brian's marriage to Mary (<i>d</i>. in or after 1596), eldest daughter of Kildare and his second wife, Elizabeth, before 1526, strengthened the alliance further. The couple had nine sons, including <a href="#cosubject_20514">Cathal O'Connor [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and two daughters. Brian was closely identified with Geraldine interests from the 1520s and was Kildare's chief ally during the 1525 campaign against Mulroney O'Carroll. During Kildare's second detention in England (1526&#150;30), Brian, acting on the earl's secret instructions, played the key role in demonstrating that the Irish lordship could not be governed without Geraldine co-operation. Throughout 1527&#150;8 he ravaged the pale, famously shoeing his horse at Tara, co. Meath, and even captured the vice-deputy, Richard Nugent, third Baron Delvin, on 12 May 1528. It worked. Kildare was allowed to return to Ireland in 1530 in order to suppress &#145;confederacies that &hellip; Ochonour had made with divers great Hirishemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.127&#150;8). He displayed his gratitude by bestowing gifts of horses and armour upon Brian. In addition Kildare persuaded the Irish privy council to resume payment of Brian's blackrent (cancelled in 1528) and to pardon his offences in November 1530.<br>
<br>Brian's influence was at its zenith, secure from challengers within his lordship and the dominant lord in the midlands. However, his relationship with Kildare tied his fortunes inextricably with those of the Geraldines and this explains why, even as the Kildare revolt of 1534&#150;5 collapsed, Brian remained loyal to the last. By mid-1535 only Brian's support allowed his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9586/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, tenth earl of Kildare (1513&#150;1537)")</script>, to continue in rebellion. This persuaded the government to maintain Brian's brother and tanist Cahir Roe O'Connor (<i>d</i>. 1548), who had long sought to be lord, against the rebels. His defection proved decisive, and in August 1535 Kildare and Brian submitted.<br>
<br>Despite his prominent role in the rebellion Brian escaped lightly: after humbly submitting and undertaking to live as a dutiful subject, he was fined 800 cattle. Thereafter, the government, preoccupied with reordering the pale, withdrew support for Cahir Roe, allowing Brian to restore his authority within Offaly. Cahir Roe was expelled from Offaly in 1536. This flagrant repudiation of his submission, coupled with his failure to pay his fine, persuaded the new lord deputy, Leonard Grey, Viscount Graney, to punish Brian. Therefore in May 1537 Graney, guided by Brian's former prisoner Delvin, invaded Offaly. He captured Brian's strongholds of Brackland and Dangan, and placed them, along with &#145;the governaunce of the countrie&#146;, in Cahir Roe's hands  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.442&#150;5). Brian, who fled before the lord deputy, remained at large, dividing his time in exile between Offaly, Tipperary, and Leix. Although Graney believed Brian was &#145;more lyker a begger then he that ever was a captyn or ruler of a contre&#146;, and celebrated his reduced circumstances&#151;&#145;goyng from on [one] to another of hys olde frynds to have mete and drynke&#146;&#151;Brian retained support among Offaly's lesser septs  (ibid., 2.474&#150;5). With their backing, and that of Ferganainm O'Carroll, the O'Dunne family, and the O'Meagher family, Brian regained the lordship in November 1537. Recognizing that Cahir Roe was unable to uphold his authority without substantial government assistance, and despite his earlier description of Brian as &#145;as ranke a traitour alwey to the King [Henry VIII] as can be divised&#146;, Graney accepted the political reality and thereafter sought to use Brian's regional influence to stabilize the midlands  (ibid., 2.437&#150;9).<br>
<br>At his formal submission before the Irish privy council Brian renounced his blackrents, promised to pay rent to the king, and petitioned to be elevated to the peerage as baron of Offaly, with confirmation of title to his lands. For some time afterwards he remained quiet, but following Graney's fall he once more ravaged the pale in April and May 1540. Brian's duplicity had long exasperated the king, but, conscious of Brian's continuing influence among the midland septs, the new lord deputy, Sir Anthony St Leger, convinced the king to pardon him. In 1541 St Leger persuaded Brian to formally renew his submission and to accept government arbitration of his dispute with Cahir Roe. During the remainder of his first term of office St Leger overlooked Brian's minor indiscretions in the midlands, while Brian paid his rents and refrained from disturbing the pale. This accommodation&#151;which saw St Leger propose Brian's elevation to the peerage and grant him a house and lands in Dublin for his better maintenance while in attendance on the government&#151;prompted the lord deputy's Irish opponents to sardonically describe Brian as &#145;your lordshipes old frende&#146;.<br>
<br>However, when Brian attacked the pale in 1546, during St Leger's absence in England, he finally exhausted the government's patience. Upon his return in mid-1547 St Leger devastated Offaly twice, without engaging Brian in battle or receiving his submission. Although Brian escaped to Connaught, where he remained until early 1548, St Leger's punitive campaigns greatly eroded his support within Offaly, and upon his return he discovered &#145;that, through terror, no one dared to give [him] food or protection&#146;. Although Brian continued in opposition until the following winter, &#145;having been abandoned by the Irish&#146;, he was forced to seek government support to regain his former authority  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1547). To this purpose he submitted in November 1548. He was arrested and transferred to the Marshalsea prison in London, where he remained until 1554, although he was pardoned in February 1549. A programme of plantation was instituted in the midlands in his absence. Against this background his sons Donagh (<i>d</i>. 1558) and Rory sought control of Offaly, but other O'Connor Faly kin-groups contested their claim and the lordship descended into anarchy.<br>
<br>Although Brian escaped from London in early 1552, he was recaptured as he tried to cross the border with Scotland, and promptly returned to prison. His release was granted by Mary I after the intercession of his daughter Margaret, who &#145;went to England, relying on the number of her friends and relatives there, and her knowledge of the English language&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1553). The reality was that St Leger, anxious to settle Offaly, hoped Brian's restoration might end the disruptive succession struggle. On securing Rory as a pledge, the government permitted Brian to return to Ireland with Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare. However, Brian's influence was spent and when it became apparent that Rory's incarceration was undermining Donagh's position, St Leger swiftly arranged another exchange of hostages: Rory was released and Brian returned to Dublin Castle, where he died some time after 1559. He was survived by sons, among whom Donagh, Rory, Cormac (<i>fl</i>. 1550&#150;1573), and Calvagh (<i>d</i>. 1564) were the most prominent, and daughters.<br>

<a name="cosubject_20514"></a><span class="headword">Cathal <span class="st"> [Charles]</span> O'Connor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Don Carlos]</span>  (1540&#150;1596), <span class="occ">spy and rebel</span>, was sent to Scotland when still a child and accompanied Henri Cleutin, seigneur d'Oysel, the French ambassador, to France in 1560. He petitioned Sir Francis Throckmorton for his restoration and was advised, in order to prove his loyalty to Elizabeth I, to join the household of Mary, queen of Scots, as a spy. He was rewarded with the restoration of lands in Offaly in 1563, including Castle Brackland, but joined the rebellion of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald and Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond. He murdered Captain Henry Mackworth in 1582 and was forced to leave Ireland, first for Scotland, then for Spain. Cathal served Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, in the Netherlands but returned to Spain after the defeat of the Spanish Armada. He was known as Don Carlos, which caused unfortunate cases of mistaken identity because people thought that he was Philip II's only son with his first wife, and was granted an annual pension of 360 crowns. He continued to interest himself in Irish affairs, corresponding with Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, and mediating for him with Philip. In November 1596 Cathal, along with his mother, wife, and children, joined the new armada planned for Ireland at Lisbon, and drowned when the ship carrying them was wrecked on the way there.<br>
