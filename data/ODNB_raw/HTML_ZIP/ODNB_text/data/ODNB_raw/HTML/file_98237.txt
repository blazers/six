<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  Alexander</span>  (<em>b. </em>1781/2), <span class="occ">soldier and writer</span>, was born in Dundonald, Ayrshire, the illegitimate son of a wealthy Scottish merchant. Almost everything known about him comes from his remarkable autobiography, published in Edinburgh in 1830. After what he recalled as an unhappy childhood marred by physical violence, at the age of eighteen he was sent to work as an overseer on slave plantations in Cura&ccedil;ao, in the Caribbean. On his first morning in the West Indies, in 1800, he was shocked when he witnessed a slave being flogged. Alexander's experiences of empire, however, stripped him of his youthful compassion and idealism.<br>
<br>After returning home and a failed attempt to emigrate to Quebec in April 1801 (he abandoned ship before the coast of Ayrshire was out of sight, and swam to shore), Alexander enlisted on 24 April 1801 in the 6th battalion of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, under the command of General Phillip Martin, in Phillip Devonford's company. They sailed for Ceylon on 15 June 1802. He was employed in the garrison of Trincomalee, and was promoted from the ranks to bombardier in 1808. In Ceylon Alexander realized that the British empire had not fulfilled his hopes for advancement and status. He wrote that he suffered from &#145;the real bitterness of a spirit dissatisfied with itself, with the world, and all around it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.141). He married a local woman (who remained unnamed in his narrative). According to Alexander the relationship grew solely out of his need for a live-in nurse to guide him back to health. He admitted beating and whipping his wife to keep her under his control. He left her, and his garrison, in October 1810. After unsuccessfully seeking the patronage of distant relations elsewhere in the military hierarchy in India he arrived back in London in August 1811. He served, unhappily, at Islandbridge, in co. Dublin, from 1812 to 1814. When he was finally discharged at the Woolwich barracks, on new year's eve 1814, he was aged thirty-two and was said to have developed &#145;chronic hepatitis which renders him unfit for service&#146;. His discharge papers described him as &#145;five feet seven inches [tall, with] brown hair, brown eyes, brown complexion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WO 97/1210 fol. 117).<br>
<br>In 1815 Alexander crossed the Atlantic again, working as a slave overseer on plantations in Demerara and serving in the Venezuelan rebel army that was fighting for independence from Spanish colonial rule. In 1817 he walked through British Guiana and into Venezuela, rejoicing (temporarily) at entering a land peopled by &#145;the children of ease and plenty [where] a perpetual spring reigned&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.4). He enlisted in Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's army alongside many other British volunteers but was disappointed at his underemployment. His descriptions of the preparations for warfare, and the disease and ill discipline that plagued Bol&iacute;var's army, were the result of careful observation. After leaving the army in 1820 he returned to work as a slave overseer, this time near Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast of New Granada. Here he met passing travellers including Gregor MacGregor, whom he described with compassion in his autobiography. After Santa Marta Alexander drifted unhappily as soldier, privateer, and merchant's assistant, unsuccessfully requesting a pension from the (now independent) Venezuelan authorities in late 1821. He then returned to Glasgow in 1822. Commenting on &#145;how strange had been [his] fate&#146;, Alexander felt he had completed a cycle of twenty-two years of &#145;misery and frustrated hopes&#146;  (ibid., 2.309).<br>
<br>Alexander drifted around central Scotland until he was imprisoned for breaking the terms of an order forbidding him from seeing his father, spending a total of seven months in Irvine and then Ayr gaols. Here he wrote his life story, a tale of constant disappointment, disillusion, and despair. The reader marvels at the spirit of adventure that convinces him that status, respect, and fortune always lie on the other side of the ocean. On his release from gaol he met the writer and editor John Howell (1788&#150;1863), who revised the manuscript and published it in Edinburgh in two volumes in 1830. Howell described Alexander as &#145;endowed with a &hellip; tenacious memory and &hellip; a great regard for truth. &hellip; He is a man according to my own heart; he will not sacrifice one iota of truth to give effect to an incident&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.vi). The original manuscript is now lost, so the extent of Howell's intervention is uncertain. The discharge papers corroborate much of the information provided on Alexander's military career, lending considerable credence to the autobiography as a whole, and suggesting that Howell's contribution was limited to style rather than content.<br>
<br>What became of Alexander Alexander after the publication of his life story remains unknown. The sections of the narrative pertaining to independence from colonial rule were edited and translated into Spanish by Jaime Tello and published in 1975 as <span class="italic">La vida de Alexander Alexander, escrita por el mismo</span> and have become widely recognized as an insightful and detailed historical source for the independence period.<br>
