<span class="headword">Stern,  (Joseph) Peter Maria</span>  (1920&#150;1991), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born into a Catholic&#150;Jewish family at Prague on 25 December 1920. He was the son of Gustav Stern, economist, and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bondy (<i>d</i>. 1939). His father, who had fought in the Czech legion in the First World War, later worked for the United Nations. Only Czech was spoken at home, and Peter was educated at Czech schools, in Prague and at the Comenius School in Vienna, though he began to learn German at the age of eleven. After German troops entered Prague in March 1939, Stern's father travelled to London to make arrangements to receive the rest of his family; his mother and her brother and his wife, however, could not bear the prospect of leaving, and chose suicide. His grandparents died in Theresienstadt concentration camp, but his half-sister Ilsa (born to his mother in a previous marriage) survived the ghetto at &#321;&oacute;d&#378;. Stern himself narrowly escaped by crossing into Poland on foot. Having obtained a British visa at Katowice, he travelled in a sealed train to Gdynia where he caught the last boat to England, and rejoined his father in London.<br>
<br>Having arrived with not a word of English, Stern set about acquiring mastery of it, listening intently to the orators at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park and even speaking there himself. He completed his education at Barry County School for Boys in Glamorgan (1939&#150;40), which must have been a very different milieu from cosmopolitan Prague and Vienna. In 1940 he planned to study economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), but when the LSE was evacuated to Cambridge he chose instead to read German and Russian, with Sanskrit, at St John's College. In 1941 he volunteered for the Czech army but soon became a &#145;tail-end johnny&#146;, a rear-gunner, in a Wellington bomber of the Czech squadron of the RAF. In September 1942 he was shot down over the Atlantic: severely wounded, he lost half his left hand and spent fourteen hours in a rubber dinghy before being picked up by a small British vessel returning from a secret operation in France. In 1943 he returned to Cambridge, and the following year he married a fellow student, Sheila Frances McMullan, daughter of Joseph Patrick and Frances McMullan; they had two sons and two daughters. Sheila Stern taught French at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Stern graduated in 1945 and took his MA degree in 1947. He trained as a teacher, but with financial assistance from his father he embarked on academic research under A. H. J. Knight and Michael Oakeshott. He received his PhD degree in 1949 for a study of the eighteenth-century Anglophile scientist and aphorist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, which he eventually rewrote and published as <span class="italic">G. C. Lichtenberg: a Doctrine of Scattered Occasions</span> in 1959. Stern's affinity to Lichtenberg expresses itself in some measure in his own work, for Stern's writing had &#145;the density of the extended aphorism, and must therefore be read closely&#146;  (Robertson, 249). Throughout his career Stern continued to be concerned with German thinkers who had found an audience in England, whether Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Spengler, or Freud. This period in Cambridge in the late 1940s was marked by Stern's somewhat prickly friendship with the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him that it was his moral duty to return to Czechoslovakia. The relationship was bound to fail in the long run. Stern himself recalled:<blockquote>There is no philosopher fuller of metaphors than Wittgenstein, but there is no account of metaphor <i>anywhere</i> in his work. Our own relationship broke apart on a metaphor. I had some idea about Lichtenberg and rushed around to see him one Saturday morning. [He] was very angry &hellip; &#145;Look here, Stern&#146;, he said, &#145;the difference between us is this: You are like the golfer cutting about and driving balls into the woods. I am the skulker on the margin, looking for the balls people like you have lost. We have completely different approaches.&#146; (J. P. Stern, <span class="italic">The Dear Purchase</span>, xiv)</blockquote>To which Stern replied, &#145;Yes, but the golfers are the people who are playing the game&#146;. Wittgenstein refused to greet him thereafter, yet, as Stern's last book, <span class="italic">The Dear Purchase</span>, made clear, Wittgenstein's influence on his own thinking remained profound.<br>
<br>After a brief spell teaching at Bedford College, University of London, from 1950 to 1952, Stern returned to Cambridge. In 1954 he was elected a fellow of St John's, where he directed studies in modern languages, and in 1957 he was promoted from assistant university lecturer in German to a full university lectureship. He left Cambridge in 1972 to become professor of German at University College, London, a post he held until his retirement in 1986. It was a testimony to his pre-eminence in his field that he should have been elected to the oldest chair of German in Great Britain. From 1981 to 1985 he served as honorary director of the University of London Institute of Germanic Studies. He held numerous prestigious appointments, and various visiting professorships between 1958 and 1989 (at New York, Berkeley, Buffalo, Virginia, G&ouml;ttingen, Williamstown, and Vienna). He was fellow at the Center for Humanities at Wesleyan University in 1972, and professor-at-large, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, from 1976 to 1982. He was British Academy master mind lecturer in 1978. He was awarded the Goethe medal by the Goethe Institut, Munich, in 1980, the same year as he received the Alexander von Humboldt research prize. In 1975 he was awarded the LittD degree of the University of Cambridge, and in 1988 was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at G&ouml;ttingen. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1990.<br>
<br>Stern was remarkably widely read in world literature. Although he was essentially a literary critic, his work linked literature with both philosophy and history. He wrote and lectured indefatigably, making use of the <i>longueurs</i> of dreary meetings to write his next lecture, article, or book longhand on blocks of yellow lined paper. His earliest publications were his own <span class="italic">Ernst J&uuml;nger: a Writer of our Time</span> and translations of R. W. Meyer, <span class="italic">Leibnitz and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution</span>, and H. E. Holthusen, <span class="italic">R. M. Rilke: a Study of his Later Poetry</span> (all 1952). One of his major concerns was nineteenth-century German literature, and his magisterial <span class="italic">Re-Interpretations: Seven Studies in Nineteenth-Century German Literature</span> (1964, repr. 1981) was followed by <span class="italic">Idylls and Realities: Studies in Nineteenth-Century German Literature</span> (1971) and <span class="italic">On Realism</span> (1973, rev. German version, 1982), a book in which Wittgenstein's influence was very evident. <span class="italic">Nietzsche</span> appeared in the <span class="roman">Fontana Modern Masters</span> series in 1978, and <span class="italic">A Study of Nietzsche</span> came out in 1979, with a revised German version in 1982. For <span class="italic">Nietzsche on Tragedy</span> (1981), written jointly with Michael Silk, he was awarded the J. G. Robertson prize of the University of London. He was fascinated by how Hitler had risen to prominence through the power of his rhetoric: his <span class="italic">Hitler: the F&uuml;hrer and the People</span> (1975, 3rd edn, 1990) was outstandingly successful, and was translated into German, Japanese, French, and Czech.<br>
<br>Stern wrote innumerable contributions for academic and more popular journals and newspapers, both British and German. Several of his best pieces, dealing with politics, philosophy, language, and literature and evoking a remarkably vivid picture of a now fading world, he selected for publication in a volume on central Europe, <span class="italic">The Heart of Europe: Essays on Literature and Ideology</span> (1992). This was dedicated to the memory of his friend and colleague Erich Heller (1911&#150;1990), whom he had first met on the quayside at Gdynia in 1939, and who had influenced him greatly in his early years at Cambridge, especially through his book <span class="italic">The Disinherited Mind</span> (1952). One of the essays in the book, &#145;A crisis of identity&#146;, contained some moving recollections of his family, but in general Stern was a private man, not much given to autobiography, though all his writings bore the stamp of what he called &#145;the weightiness of lived experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">On Realism</span>, 1973, 20). <span class="italic">The Heart of Europe</span> showed how Stern was simultaneously attracted and disturbed by the problematic German and central European culture, and these issues were also central to his last book, <span class="italic">The Dear Purchase</span> (1995), the culmination of thirty years' work. The underlying idea of &#145;the dear purchase&#146;, which he traced back in particular to Nietzsche, was that man needed to be redeemed, but could only be so through the most rigorous exercise of the will and even then might still fail. He argued that German literature of the first half of the twentieth century was &#145;dominated by a morality or moral theology of strenuousness which also makes its appearance in politics&#146;  (Stern, <span class="italic">Dear Purchase</span>, 382). He saw this theme as providing common ground for such writers as Thomas Mann, Robert Musil, Ernst J&uuml;nger, Hans Carossa, Stefan George, Georg Trakl, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gottfried Benn, Bertolt Brecht, Hermann Hesse, and Franz Kafka, authors whose ideologies appeared to be so widely divergent. Stern belonged to a generation that, repelled by the descent of Germany into barbarity, did not find the reading of German literature easy, and he found himself questioning his earlier assumption that the politics of the era could be separated from its literature.<br>
<br>Stern was an inspiring teacher, a man of fearsome intellect, and a severe critic. Yet he was approachable and remarkably kind. He took it in good part when he was lampooned in <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> for riding to hounds like an archetypal English gentleman&#151;he was in fact the most unpompous of men. Although some of his friends and acolytes saw it as a slight that he was never given a chair in Cambridge, he was modest and private enough not to show whether it rankled with him. He died of pancreatic cancer at his home, 83 Barton Road, Cambridge, on 18 November 1991, and was buried that month in Cambridge. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.<br>
