<span class="headword">West,  Charles Richard  Sackville-</span>, sixth Earl De La Warr  (1815&#150;1873), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 13 November 1815, in Upper Grosvenor Street, London, was the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29083/', "George John West, fifth Earl De La Warr (1791&#150;1869)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29087/', "West, John, first Earl De La Warr")</script>], and his wife, Lady Elizabeth, later first Baroness Buckhurst (1795&#150;1870), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24445/', "John Frederick Sackville, third duke of Dorset")</script>. The fifth earl and his sons took the additional name of Sackville on 30 November 1843 by royal licence. After education at Harrow School, Charles obtained the commission of ensign in the 43rd foot on 26 July 1833, and was promoted to a second lieutenancy on 30 August. On 5 June 1835 he became lieutenant in the 15th foot, and on 15 April 1842 captain in the 21st foot. In 1845 and 1846 he served as aide-de-camp and acting military secretary to Sir Hugh Gough during the First Anglo-Sikh War, and was several times mentioned in dispatches. On 3 April 1846 he obtained the brevet rank of major, and in the following year received the Indian medal with three clasps. On 2 August 1850 he attained the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, and on 23 April 1852 the regimental rank of major. Following the death of his elder brother, George John Frederick Sackville-West, Viscount Cantelupe, on 25 June 1850, he became heir to the earldom, and from then until his father's death he used the courtesy title Lord West.<br>
<br>Lord West was sent to the Crimea in 1854, was present at the battle of Inkerman in command of a wing of the 21st fusiliers, and initiated the attack on the battery on Shelf Hill which is believed to have led to General Dannenberg's retreat. On 28 November 1854 he was promoted colonel. On 18 June 1855 he commanded the reserve in the unsuccessful assault made against the west flank of the Redan, and after the death of Sir John Campbell (1816&#150;1855) assumed the command of the attack. In the same year he received the Crimean medal with four clasps, and on 27 July was made CB. On 24 July 1856 he obtained the local rank of major-general. On 2 August 1856 he was made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He also received the Military Medal of Sardinia, and was made a knight of the third class of the Mejidiye on 2 March 1858. On 29 October 1864 he became a major-general. He succeeded his father as sixth Earl De La Warr on 24 February 1869, and on 20 May 1871 was created KCB. He was a Conservative peer, but supported Irish disestablishment in 1869. On 30 September 1871 he was appointed a commissioner to carry out the abolition of purchase in the army. On the morning of 22 April 1873 he left The Bull inn, Cambridge, and drowned himself in the River Granta; the coroner's jury's verdict was &#145;temporary insanity&#146;. He was unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother Reginald Windsor Sackville-West, seventh earl.<br>
