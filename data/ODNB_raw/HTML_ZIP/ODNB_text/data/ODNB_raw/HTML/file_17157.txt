<span class="headword">Ludlam,  Isaac</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, is of unknown origins and upbringing. He earned his living as a quarryman and owned &#145;considerable property&#146; at South Wingfield, Derbyshire  (Thompson, 667). He was a Methodist who actively engaged in preaching.<br>
<br>In June 1817 Ludlam took a prominent part in the &#145;Derbyshire insurrection&#146; or &#145;Pentrich rising&#146; promoted by Jeremiah Brandreth, which saw an assembly of stockingers, quarrymen, and ironworkers march to Nottingham from a handful of villages in the Derby Peak. Before the outbreak Ludlam occupied himself in the manufacture of pikes, which were stored in a quarry near his house. On 8 June he went with another of the rebels, William Turner, to the White Horse inn at Pentrich. Here a meeting presided over by Brandreth took place, at which Ludlam read out a list of those persons in the neighbourhood from whom it was proposed to rob firearms. On the night of Monday, 9 June, Ludlam, accompanied by his three sons, joined the rebels under Brandreth at Topham Close, and the party of 200&#150;300 men set out towards Nottingham. Ludlam, who acted as a rear-guard, was active in demanding arms from houses on the road, and compelled several persons to join in the movement against their will. When the party went into an inn at Codnor, Ludlam was stationed outside as sentinel to prevent waverers from escaping. In the course of the march Ludlam frequently stated that the object of the party was to join another body of men in Nottingham Forest, and then proceed to the town itself to guard an insurrectionary parliament which had been assembled there.<br>
<br>Ludlam escaped capture by the dragoons, who dispersed the rebel band on 10 June, but was subsequently arrested, and tried for high treason by the special commission at Derby. His counsel attempted to show that he was only Brandreth's dupe, which seems to have been true, and that his offence amounted to riot only. But he was found guilty, and executed with Brandreth and William Turner in front of the county gaol at Derby on 7 November. His corpse was then beheaded in line with the punishment for high treason. Ludlam's body was later that day buried, without a service, at St Werburgh's Church, Derby. His sons, despite pleading guilty at the trial, were discharged.<br>
