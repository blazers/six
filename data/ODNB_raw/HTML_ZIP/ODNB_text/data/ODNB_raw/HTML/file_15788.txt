<span class="headword">Knox,  Robert</span>  (1815&#150;1883), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, was the third son of Hugh Knox, for forty years a ruling elder of the parish of Urney, co. Tyrone. He was born at Clady, in that parish. He entered Glasgow University in 1834 and graduated MA in 1837. He subsequently studied in the collegiate department of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where during his student days he was an active promoter of the union between the synod of Ulster and the Secession synod, which resulted in the formation of the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in 1840. He was licensed to preach in 1840, being ordained by the presbytery of Strabane, co. Tyrone, in April of that year, and was sent as a missionary to the south of Ireland. Several congregations owed their origin to his labours. On 10 June 1842 he was installed as assistant and successor to the Revd John Whiteside, pastor of the Second Congregation of Coleraine. Next year he became minister of the Linenhall Street Church, Belfast.<br>
<br>Knox was soon one of the most energetic of the Belfast clergy, being particularly active in promoting the erection of new churches and schoolhouses, and in furthering the work of the town mission, of which he became honorary secretary. He established and edited a monthly periodical entitled the <span class="italic">Irish Presbyterian</span>, and published many sermons. A prolonged newspaper controversy with the Revd Theophilus Campbell of Trinity Church, Belfast, afterwards dean of Dromore, on the question of baptismal regeneration, brought him into much prominence. The letters were subsequently collected and published. In 1861 he received the degree of doctor of divinity from Union College, Schenectady, New York. He was one of the founders of the Sabbath School Society for Ireland in connection with the Presbyterian church, and one of the earliest and most enthusiastic promoters of the Presbyterian alliance, in which all the Presbyterian churches of the world are represented.<br>
<br>In 1870 Knox married the daughter of William Gilbert, of Belfast. After his death she married the Revd George Matthews DD of Quebec. Knox died at his home, Windsor Park, Belfast, on 16 August 1883 and was buried in the borough cemetery.<br>
