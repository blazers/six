<span class="headword">Aucher, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the only surviving son and heir of James Aucher (<i>d</i>. 1509), gentleman, of Otterden, Kent, and his wife, Alice Hill. The father, a son and heir of John and Margaret Aucher, was the successful head of a minor gentry family who bequeathed much of his estate to the church. In his will of 1 January 1509 he entrusted his son to Roger Churche (<i>d</i>. 1524), rector of Bishopsbourne, Kent, and vicar-general in spirituals to John Morton, archbishop of Canterbury, and John Hales of Gray's Inn and Canterbury, &#145;fynding my said son Anthony to Scoole and lernyng&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/16, fol. 96). Aucher's mother subsequently married into the family of Hardres of Upper Hardres, Kent.<br>
<br>Anthony Aucher began his ascent in Kent and at court in the 1530s as a servant of Thomas Cromwell, secretary of state. His connection to Cromwell dates from at least 1532, and by 1535 he was clearly in his service, active in miscellaneous Kentish affairs. Aucher acquired the position of auditor and surveyor of the estates of Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, and ingratiated himself with Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, governor of Calais. In 1537 Aucher was appointed paymaster of the royal haven works at Dover through the intervention of Cromwell and his agent Henry Polsted, and in 1539 he became one of the superintendents for the construction of the new bulwarks in the downs. During the ensuing Anglo-French war he was paymaster and surveyor for all building works at Dover, including the extensive alterations to the Maison Dieu Hospital when it was converted in 1545 to a victualling yard for the supply of the navy and the army in France.<br>
<br>Aucher married well, before 1540, to Affera, daughter of William Cornwallis of Norfolk. With other former members of Cromwell's Kentish clientele, he aligned himself with the county's religious conservatives of the 1540s and flourished. This is perhaps surprising, for in 1540 he had in his household at Dover as tutor to his children the reformer Nicholas Partridge, a pupil and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Heinrich Bullinger. Aucher accompanied the royal army to France in 1544 as a lieutenant, responsible for aspects of transportation and supplies. At court he became joint master of the tents and pavilions, and master of the jewel house from 29 September 1545 to 6 June 1557. He was victualler of the works at Dover, chief victualler of Boulogne and Le Havre by October 1545 until 4 March 1550, surveyor of the victuals at Boulogne, Newhaven, and Blackness (1545&#150;50), victualler of Calais from February 1551, marshal of Calais from 6 October 1552 until his death and receiver-general of the second court of augmentations for Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. Aucher also served as a JP of Kent, and was named to the chantry commissions of 1546 and 1548 for the county. He was knighted on 22 February 1547 at the festivities that followed Edward VI's coronation.<br>
<br>Aucher's activities during the French wars and the debasement of the coinage led to his management of very sizeable amounts of money and commodities. In February 1547 he personally delivered 4116 ounces of plate from Christ Church Priory, Canterbury, to the mint for coining, and over the next four years he sent there &pound;24,966 worth of plate from the chantries and free chapels, a good proportion of which was melted into ingots by Aucher in a specially constructed facility within the Tower of London. In addition, he became responsible for the plate confiscated from Thomas Seymour, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, and other notables. Aucher appeared able to weather every political storm, and was able to avoid accounting for his principal fiscal responsibilities for well over a decade. In July 1556 it was determined that he had never rendered any account as master of the jewel house under three monarchs. In his victualling accounts he was permitted to carry over year-to-year cash balances exceeding &pound;10,000 without verification, to write off substantial sums on his uncorroborated testimony, and to charge exorbitant rates for victualling Boulogne's fortresses. In an era of laxity in fiscal accounting Aucher's activities were viewed as unprecedented, and repeatedly called into question.<br>
<br>The rising gentleman employed his new-found wealth and connections to embark upon an ambitious programme of personal aggrandizement, well in excess of his annual wages and perquisites of office. From the crown Aucher acquired various lands, including Cromwell's possessions of the late priory of Mottenden, Kent. In 1549 he and Polsted, of Chilworth, Surrey, completed the payment of &pound;2744 17<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. for the manors of Ashford and Esture, Kent. Aucher was one of the major purchasers of crown lands in Kent following the dissolution of the monasteries, acquiring property conservatively valued in excess of &pound;180 per annum. Private acquisitions included the purchase of the manors of East Hall, Kent, in 1552, and Bishopsbourne in 1557.<br>
<br>In 1545 Aucher built in Kent, at his own cost, the great bark <i>Aucher</i>, a vessel of 240 tons with a crew of 200. Immediately leased to the crown as a warship, the bark served as Thomas Wyndham's flagship in the Scottish campaign of 1547&#150;8. In November 1550, at the conclusion of the war, Aucher sent his ship on a celebrated exploratory voyage of commerce to the Aegean under the command of Roger Bodenham. Aucher had been assigned by Edward VI's privy council a leading role in the defence of Kent during the Anglo-French war of 1549&#150;50, and he aided in combating the popular insurrection of 1549 in the county. It was while engaged in the latter activity that Aucher emerged as a strident social conservative, protesting in September to Somerset against the &#145;evyll accustomyd myschefs&#146; of &#145;the Commonwelthe of Kent called Latymer&#146;, and asking permission to &#145;have the knave cuffed and beaten in every corner of the shire&#146;  (Beer and Nash, 176&#150;7). The antagonism between Aucher and the Kentish commons was mutual: in the food shortages and economic crisis of the winter of 1550 he was singled out by protesters as a worthy candidate for hanging. The next year Aucher was drawn into controversy again when his servant, John Greene, was found guilty of complicity in the notorious murder of Thomas Arden of Feversham.<br>
<br>The successes and ultimate disgrace of Aucher were closely linked to his ruthless exploitation of crown offices for personal aggrandizement. When Aucher attempted in 1545 to secure in advance a royal pardon for all future negligence in his new office as victualler of Boulogne, alleging that his personal estate was insufficient to bear the risk, Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, wrote a damning, mocking critique and demanded that he was &#145;eyther to serve like a man, manly, with such conditions in service as reason wold he shold be content with, or elles to make sute, for his inhabilite, to be discharged&#146; from office  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Muller, 150&#150;51). Aucher was never forced to account for the large annual balance he created for this account; in the end the privy council permitted him to write off on unsupported testimony the sum of &pound;7770 for commodities allegedly lost at the English abandonment of Boulogne and Newhaven. Aucher also successfully stalled until after his death demands for the &pound;2356 due in the court of augmentations for his receipts as receiver-general for the year 1548&#150;9. By March 1552 he had paid off a separate debt of &pound;4395 for his arrears in this office during the year 1549&#150;50. Only under Mary I did the government adopt a firmer approach, and begin to default his wages for fresh irregularities in his receivership accounts. Aucher lost control of some of his estates. He had already sold Swingfield to Sir Henry Palmer in 1551. Ashford manor, mortgaged to Sir Andrew Judde, was foreclosed upon in 1556, and Esture was sold to Judde in 1557. However, Aucher's problems ran deeper. Twice in March 1555 the Venetian ambassador reported on rumours of a plot to betray Calais to the French and identified as the ringleader the marshal, Aucher, who was distrusted by Philip and Mary. He was called to account for the keepership of the jewel house in 1556. In June 1557 Aucher surrendered the office to the queen in exchange for a payment of &pound;200 and a gratuity of &pound;166 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in recognition of service. He died intestate in early January the following year, slain at the French capture of Calais after leading several notable sorties. The crown moved speedily to acquire his assets, but initially secured merely &pound;232 12<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. from the seizure of household effects at his seat of Bishopsbourne. Unable under existing legislation to confiscate Aucher's landed property, the state was still seeking restitution fifty years later. John Aucher, the eldest son, died at about the same time as his father; John's sole daughter and heir, Anne, inherited the family manor of Otterden and subsequently married Sir Humphrey Gilbert.<br>
