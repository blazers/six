<span class="headword">Bossom,  Alfred Charles</span>, Baron Bossom  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">architect and politician</span>, was born at 17 Caledonian Road, Islington, London, on 16 October 1881, the elder son of Alfred Henry Bossom (1854&#150;1919), a stationer, and Amelia Jane (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of Edmund Henry Hammond of Finsbury. He was educated at St Thomas's Charterhouse Church of England School in Finsbury, and was then articled as an architect, as well as attending the evening school of the Royal Academy. In April 1900 he joined the housing section of the London county council's architect's department as a draughtsman.<br>
<br>Bossom migrated to New York about 1905, in the first instance apparently to assist the English amateur architect and socialite George A. Crawley, who had acquired domestic commissions for Henry Phipps, a partner in US Steel. Doubtless on the strength of this connection and his experience at the London county council, he was put in charge of some industrial housing being built in conditions of urgency by US Steel at Pittsburgh. His involvement in a later crash programme of housing at Bridgeport, Connecticut, for Remington workers making arms for the Russian market at the start of the First World War, enhanced Bossom's expertise in building productivity. But he also worked on the restoration of the historic Fort Ticonderoga, New York, for the Pell family (1908&#150;9).<br>
<br>In 1910 Bossom married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of Samuel Gamble Bayne, an oil magnate of Ulster origin and the president of the Seaboard National Bank, set up to deal in oil certificates. This appears to have marked the start of his independent career as an architect of banks and skyscrapers, which he conducted from an elegant office in Manhattan, designing mainly in the &#145;bankers' Renaissance&#146; style then popular in America. He also took a keen interest in the blend of pre-Columbian and early Spanish&#150;American architecture in Mexico, which he characterized as &#145;a style so free, so largely suited to our needs that it would seem as if the American point of view had found its expression on this continent centuries ago&#146;  (Bossom, <span class="italic">Architectural Pilgrimage</span>, 6&#150;7). Beside the Seaboard Bank's headquarters in New York, he built: the Liberty Bank, Buffalo, New York; the Virginia Trust Company and First National Bank, Richmond, Virginia; the People's Bank, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; the Greenwich Trust Company, Greenwich, Connecticut; and the Magnolia Petroleum Building, Dallas, Texas&#151;in its time the tallest structure south of Washington. By the early 1920s Bossom was wealthy, with powerful business and professional connections and a burgeoning taste for politics. Treasurer of the New York Architectural League, he was also honorary secretary of the US Baltic League, chairman of the American Mid-European Association, and founder of the Movement for Co-operation in Government, while his wife was treasurer to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.<br>
<br>However, Bossom had retained his British citizenship, and in 1926 the couple made their home in England, where their children were already at school. Free of the need to work, Bossom rejoined the London county council, at first as a &#145;Municipal Reform&#146; member of its housing committee (1927) and then as an alderman (1930&#150;34). In the general election of 1929 he was defeated as a Conservative in Hackney, but in 1931 he triumphed at Maidstone with a majority of over 20,000. He bought an ancient house (Stoneacre, Otham) near Maidstone and for twenty-eight years conscientiously nursed the seat, to which he was regularly re-elected with substantial majorities.<br>
<br>The death of his wife and eldest son, Bruce Bayne (1917&#150;1932), in a flying accident clinched Bossom's commitment to politics and public service. He was totally dedicated to the Conservative Party, and was conspicuously loyal in turn to its successive leaders. From a maiden speech on &#145;waste in the construction of airfields&#146; he went on to committees involving public expenditure and was resolutely opposed to high taxation. An early mark was made with a trade mission in 1933 to the Baltic states, exploiting his earlier contacts. He acted as a spokesman for architecture and construction in parliament, introducing as a private member in 1938 the second <span class="roman">Architects Registration Bill</span>, which secured the &#145;closed shop&#146; in architecture, and campaigning for the reduction of building costs through American-style efficiency in construction. Long before he had argued that &#145;commercial buildings have to be commercial &hellip; bringing in a revenue commensurate with the amount of investment&#146;  (Bossom, <span class="italic">Architectural Pilgrimage</span>, 9). Bossom fervently admired the American skyscraper, and published <span class="italic">Building to the Skies: the Romance of the Skyscraper</span> in 1934. But he strenuously opposed the introduction of higher buildings in Europe, and once crossed the Atlantic by liner just to argue the point in a conference.<br>
<br>Bossom was naturally drawn into the wartime investigations into fast construction methods, and in 1943 headed a mission to examine the success of the Tennessee valley authority in assembling prefabricated homes brought to the site in halves, with fittings already complete. This mission had some impact on the British &#145;prefab&#146; programme. Subsequently he became president of the Modular Society, set up in 1952 to bring dimensional co-ordination to post-war building production. He also took particular interest in the Royal Society of Arts, of which he was chairman. Preferring the variety of delegations, international business and friendship associations, and social and voluntary organizations to the lure of ministerial office, Bossom gloried in giving parties and going on trips to other countries. He amassed dignities and honorary offices with the same enthusiastic acquisitiveness as he collected North American Indian artefacts and police truncheons. A conscientious attender of the Commons when in England, he fell in love with its rituals and procedures, and was moved to publish <span class="italic">Our House</span> (1948), a brief admiring exposition of its formalities.<br>
<br>In 1934 Bossom was married again, this time to Mrs Elinor Armstrong, daughter of Samuel Gamble Dittenhofer of Minnesota; they divorced in 1947. He received a baronetcy in 1953, and took into his arms a steel building column with three floor girders and the motto <i>Esto quo es</i>&#151;&#145;be yourself&#146;&#151;a wry comment, perhaps, on Churchill's witticism: &#145;Bossom? Funny name&#151;neither one thing nor the other.&#146; In 1959 he finally stood down from the Commons. A life peerage in 1960 took him to the Lords, where he was not conspicuous. He died on 4 September 1965 at his home, 1 St John's House, Smith Square, Westminster, and was buried three days later at Thursley, Surrey, next to his first wife. The baronetcy passed to his second son, Clive (<i>b</i>. 1918). A third son, Doric (1922&#150;1959), predeceased him.<br>
