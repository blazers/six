<span class="headword">Kynton,  John</span>  (1450s&#150;1536), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, was born in the 1450s, perhaps in Lincolnshire or Yorkshire where he is known to have had personal ties. He entered the Franciscan order at the Stamford convent, probably while still in his teens. His age might explain the fact that although he took minor orders in December 1472, he was not ordained to the priesthood until March 1477. Kynton remained at Stamford until the early 1480s when he was sent to study at the Franciscan convent at Oxford. Nothing is known of him during this period, but it seems he acquired a considerable reputation as a scholar. He incepted for his doctorate early in 1495 and was permitted to remain at the university as a teacher.<br>
<br>Kynton's teaching took him, unusually for a regular, beyond his own convent into the wider academic community. In 1502 he was appointed praelector in theology at Magdalen College, a residential position that he held for almost two decades. During this period Kynton emerged as one of the most influential figures in the faculty of theology. He was elected senior theologus three times between 1502 and 1530 and was deputed to preach the Easter day sermon in 1515. He also became prominent in university government, serving as the chancellor's commissary for no fewer than seven terms between 1503 and 1517. Kynton's stature as a scholar also brought him to the attention of church leaders. In 1521 he was one of five scholars called upon by Cardinal Wolsey to examine the teachings of Martin Luther. It may have been as a result of this that he was appointed to the university's most prestigious chair, the Lady Margaret professorship in theology. Kynton remained in post for several years, but early in 1530 his reputation was badly damaged when the archbishop of Canterbury, William Warham, accused him of forgery. The details of the case are obscure, but it is likely to have precipitated his resignation from his chair in October 1530. In spite of these troubles Kynton remained at Oxford and was involved in scholarly discussions of the king's divorce in 1531. He died at Oxford on 20 January 1536 and was buried in Durham College chapel.<br>
