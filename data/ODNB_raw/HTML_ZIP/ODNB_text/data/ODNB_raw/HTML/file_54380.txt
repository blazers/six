<span class="headword">Vevers,  (Henry) Gwynne</span>  (1916&#150;1988), <span class="occ">marine biologist and intelligence officer</span>, was born on 13 November 1916 at Girvan, Ayrshire, the elder son of Geoffrey Marr Vevers and Catherine Rigby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Andrews, from Ayrshire. Gwynne Vevers's zoological and popularizing bent were dictated by his education and by his father's interests. Geoffrey Marr Vevers (1890&#150;1970) was a helminthologist at the London School of Tropical Medicine and an honorary parasitologist at London Zoo from 1919; as superintendent of the zoo in 1921 he was instrumental in the acquisition of Whipsnade. As an avowed popularizer and as a communist fellow-traveller&#151;he raised medical aid for the USSR during the Second World War and founded and edited the <span class="italic">Anglo-Soviet Journal</span>&#151;Geoffrey Marr Vevers saw the distribution of knowledge as a duty. He was one of the first BBC television educators at Alexandra Palace and a contributor to <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> in 1946&#150;7.<br>
<br>Gwynne Vevers was a scholar at St Paul's School, where his collections of butterflies, mosses, and fossil brachiopods won him three Smee prizes. He gained a Kitchener scholarship and college exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by J. Z. Young and Solly Zuckerman. In 1936, as an undergraduate, he collaborated with James Fisher on a paper announcing a method for estimating the gannet population on the Scottish island of Ailsa Craig. He travelled to Greenland with the Oxford University Exploration Club in 1936 and to the Faeroes in 1937 to collect mouse and gannet statistics. From the Faeroes and Iceland in 1937&#150;9 he reported to the naval intelligence division of the Admiralty on the German ships which were charting deep-water channels. So began Vevers's covert intelligence gathering, which was to last for several decades. His roving life as a zoologist proved perfect cover; even as late as 1970 he was being debriefed after a zoological trip to Rangoon.<br>
<br>From 1940 Vevers carried out wartime intelligence work for the RAF. He used aerial reconnaissance of the ice floes to determine the deep-water channels. When the German battleship <i>Bismarck</i> broke out of Bergen Fjord in May 1941 and sank HMS <i>Hood</i> off Iceland, Vevers predicted her position from his charts, and she was intercepted and sunk off Brest. For his work he was made a military MBE. He switched in 1943 to the Air Ministry, where with another zoologist, Wing Commander Frederick S. Russell, he assessed and distributed &#145;Ultra&#146; ciphers after the British broke the encryptions of the German coding device Enigma. Towards the war's end he was in Germany, hunting down Reichsminister Rust, who committed suicide a few hours before Vevers caught up with him. Vevers was a gifted linguist: by 1945 he could deliver a speech in Russian to former prisoners of war. He spoke Norwegian and all the Scandinavian languages including Faeroese, and used his far-north posting to perfect his Icelandic at Reykjav&iacute;k University.<br>
<br>After the war Russell became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth and brought Vevers in as bursar. Here from 1945 to 1955 he studied starfish and published on invertebrate pigments with Gilbert Kennedy. In 1949 he completed his Oxford DPhil on the effect of the female sex hormone oestrone; in this he showed that the plumage of the Amherst pheasant was a secondary sexual characteristic under hormonal control. At Plymouth, Vevers developed an underwater camera, which proved as useful in recording marine life around the Eddystone lighthouse as in searches for lost submarines by the US Navy. In 1954 came his first book, <span class="italic">The British Seashore</span>. Made assistant director of science in charge of the aquarium at London Zoo in 1955, he worked with Norman Millot on the pigmented eye-spots of echinoderms. This fascination with the hormonal and histochemical control of coloration led him to join up with his Savile Club friend Harold Munro Fox to write <span class="italic">The Nature of Animal Colours</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Amiable and unflappable, Vevers became a mainstay of Zoological Society meetings. He edited the <span class="italic">Journal of Zoology</span> and the <span class="italic">Zoological Record</span>, and as curator of the aquarium he introduced several novel exhibits, including the spectacular sea urchin <i>Diadema</i>. His administrative talents were in demand elsewhere: as zoological secretary and vice-president of the Linnean Society; on the Biological Council; at the Marine Biological Association and the Freshwater Biological Association; and as a trustee of the Savile Club.<br>
<br>Vevers was a very private person, yet he was also the perfect raconteur and this, with his interest in photography and sea life, made him an ideal natural-history presenter for the BBC unit in Bristol, which began its outside broadcasts in the early 1950s. He served on the science selection committee of the National Film Archive for over thirty years, and he appeared on Desmond Morris's <span class="italic">Zoo Time</span>. Vevers himself preferred the radio, and became a familiar wireless voice to the post-war generation.<br>
<br>Vevers's family life was very private indeed, and largely unknown to colleagues. He had four wives: he married Mary Brandt in 1942 (James Fisher, 1912&#150;1970, was best man); (Pamela) Joyce Brigstocke on 9 September 1950 (he had with her a son, Geoffrey, in 1952); Winwood Reade in April 1969; and Barbara Oliver on 23 December 1974. He greatly enjoyed the company of women and there were a number of other, less formal liaisons.<br>
<br>Vevers was the oldest member of the Royal Society expedition to the Solomon Islands in 1965, and to the Cook Islands in 1969, to celebrate the bicentenary of Captain Cook's voyage. During the latter expedition he made a pidgin-English speech to the people of Aitutaku.<br>
<br>Vevers's writing was prolific: he produced nearly one hundred books and translations (from eight European languages). Most were popular: on birds, eggs, tracks, fish, animals of the Arctic and of Russia, the human body, the London Zoo, and aquariums. Twenty-four publishers kept him in commissions for thirty years, and he kept the natural world in sight for an increasingly urbanized population. Ultimately his children's books made him known worldwide. But he never would write his wartime memoirs, nor disclose his intelligence activity, despite the cajoling of publishers. He retired from the zoo in 1981 to his home, Wood's House, Bampton, Oxfordshire, where he died on 24 July 1988: he was cremated at Oxford on 1 August.<br>
