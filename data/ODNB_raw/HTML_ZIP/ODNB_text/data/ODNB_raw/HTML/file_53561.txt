<span class="headword">Barnes, Sir  Hugh Shakespear</span>  (1853&#150;1940), <span class="occ">administrator in India and banker</span>, was born in Shahjahanpur, India, the son of James Ralph Barnes of the Indian Civil Service. His mother was sister of Sir Rivers Thompson (1827&#150;1890), sometime governor of Bengal.<br>
<br>Barnes was a member of one of those families mentioned by Kipling in &#145;The Tomb of his Ancestors&#146; in <span class="italic">The Day's Work</span> as serving India &#145;generation after generation&#146;. His great-grandfather on his maternal side was George Nisbet Thompson, private secretary to Warren Hastings; his father was brother of George Carnac Barnes CB, who served in the Indian mutiny as commissioner of the Cis-Sutlej states and was foreign secretary in Lord Canning's government.<br>
<br>Educated at Malvern College, in 1871 Barnes came top of the list in the competitive Indian Civil Service examination. He joined the Indian Civil Service in Allahabad in 1874 and in less than two years had been selected by Sir John Strachey, then finance member of Lord Lytton's government, to be his private secretary. He married twice, first, in 1878, Winifred, daughter of Sir John Strachey; she died in Calcutta in 1892, leaving a son and a daughter, and second, in 1894, his cousin, Edith Helen, daughter of the Revd Reginald Henry Barnes, with whom he had two sons, including the radio and television director <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30603/', "Sir George Reginald Barnes")</script>.<br>
<br>A distinguished career in the Indian Civil Service, during which Barnes was revenue commissioner for Baluchistan under Sir Robert Sandeman, administrator and reformer, culminated in his being appointed foreign secretary to the government of India in 1900, president of the central committee for the Delhi durbar in 1903, and lieutenant-governor of Burma in the same year. He was created KCVO for his work for the Delhi durbar, and was credited with his KCSI earlier that year. For his service in Baluchistan&#151;consolidating Sandeman's work, raising the standards of administration, and conciliating in the affairs of the chiefs&#151;a bronze statue of Sir Hugh was unveiled in Quetta in 1904.<br>
<br>During his time as lieutenant-governor of Burma, Barnes recognized that communications were an imperative for the material advance of a country so rich in natural resources. He formulated a number of development projects, and impressed on the government of India the necessity of increasing the allocation for public works in Burma.<br>
<br>In 1905, on his appointment to the Council of India in Whitehall, Barnes resigned from Burma. While he was a member of the council, he was able to use his experience of India to criticize constructively the Morley&#150;Minto reforms, which, among other improvements, broadened the basis of Indian government and allowed Indians to sit on the central legislative council.<br>
<br>In 1913, before his term was due to end, Barnes resigned from the council in order to take up work in the City. He was already on the board of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), to which he was appointed in 1909; he now joined the boards of the Burmah Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia. He became chairman of the bank in 1916, and served until 1937, and remained on the boards of both the bank and APOC, at that time the two most important institutions in Persia, until his death. He was also chairman of Tankers Ltd and of the Scottish-American Oil Transport Company, as well as director of many associated undertakings, and of the Anglo-Malay Rubber and Royal Insurance companies. On account of these directorships, and his chairmanship of the Imperial Bank, he became an important figure in the City. He used his considerable influence whenever required, notably in retaining Britain's commitment to Mesopotamia in 1920. Given his large interests in middle eastern oil and banking, this was not surprising.<br>
<br>Sir Hugh Barnes died at his residence, 19 Sheffield Terrace, London, on 15 February 1940, aged eighty-six. He was survived by his second wife and his four children.<br>
