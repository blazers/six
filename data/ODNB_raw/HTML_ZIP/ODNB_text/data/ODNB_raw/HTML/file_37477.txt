<span class="headword">Gould, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (1661&#150;1728), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 3 December 1661, the third (but first surviving) son of John Gould, a wealthy nonconformist merchant of London, and his wife, Mary. In 1688 Gould married Frances, daughter of Sir John Hartopp, third baronet, of Freathby, Leicestershire; there were two daughters of the marriage. He was knighted on 14 April 1721.<br>
<br>It was after the revolution of 1688 that Gould first came to prominence when he became one of the largest suppliers of hemp, pitch, and tar to the Royal Navy; and in this capacity, immediately before the War of the Spanish Succession, he played an important part in providing the navy with Russian hemp from Archangel in place of the supplies that could no longer be obtained from Riga (beleaguered by the Russians). In 1694 Gould invested &pound;2000 in the newly founded Bank of England and he was one of those instructed to draw up its by-laws. In 1697 he became a director of the bank and served continuously (with statutory intervals) down to his death. He was deputy governor of the bank from 1709 to 1711 and governor from 1711 to 1713. It was in the former role that, with the governor and two other directors, he attended the queen on 15 June 1710 to desire on the bank's behalf that she make no further ministerial changes following the replacement (as secretary of state) of Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland, by William Legge, first earl of Dartmouth.<br>
<br>Gould was a member of the group of so-called tobacco contractors who in 1698 had secured from Peter the Great the right to export tobacco from England to Russia. But to be able to do this the contractors needed to gain admission to the Russia Company and Gould played his part in the attack on the company. Eventually he gained admission to the company and became a director and sometime governor. After having been an interloper in the East India trade in 1696, he was a major investor in the &#145;new&#146; East India flotation of 1698, and was both a director of the company and manager for the united East India trade over the years 1699&#150;1708.<br>
<br>It was probably the affairs of the East India trade that propelled Gould into politics; with the &#145;old&#146; East India Company still in existence, many members of the &#145;new&#146; company sought election to parliament to protect the company's interests. Accordingly, he contested New Shoreham, a venal borough in Sussex, and won it in both of the 1701 elections. (Following the first election, however, he was successfully petitioned against and had to withdraw, but he survived the petition that followed the second.) He represented New Shoreham from 1701 to 1708 and from 1710 until his death. In parliament Gould's career was of little note until the later years of Anne's reign when, in 1713, he spoke three times (and very effectively) against the treaty of commerce with France. Following the accession of George I, he seconded a motion of 12 April 1717 that English trade to the Baltic could not be carried on unless the king of Sweden was brought to reason, and during the South Sea crisis he advocated strong measures against the directors.<br>
<br>Thereafter Gould spoke on two occasions (1723 and 1725) on customs matters, and in 1726 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Essay on the Public Debts</span>, which in 1727 prompted a rejoinder, <span class="italic">A State of the National Debt</span>, reputedly by William Pulteney, earl of Bath. It was on this subject that Gould made his last recorded parliamentary speech in February 1728. He died five months later, on 21 July 1728.<br>
