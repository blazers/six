<span class="headword">Holburne,  Francis</span>  (1704&#150;1771), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Sir James Holburne, first baronet, of Menstrie, Edinburghshire. He entered the navy in 1720 as a volunteer in the <i>St Albans</i>, and passed his examination on 28 January 1726; he was promoted lieutenant on 12 December 1727 and captain on 14 July 1739. In 1740 he commanded the frigate <i>Dolphin</i> in the channel and North Sea. In 1745&#150;6 he commanded the <i>Argyle</i> in the West Indies, and in December 1747 he was appointed to the <i>Kent</i> as Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke's flag-captain in the channel and the Bay of Biscay. In September 1748 he exchanged into the <i>Bristol</i>, but was almost immediately afterwards moved into the <i>Tavistock</i> (50 guns), a worn-out ship, in which he was sent to the Leeward Islands as commodore and commander-in-chief. His principal work was diplomatic rather than naval. By the terms of the treaty of 1684 Tobago was neutralized; but early in 1749 it came to Holburne's knowledge that M. De Caylus, the governor of Martinique, had established a fortified post there. As Holburne's squadron consisted of one rotten ship of 50 guns and two equally rotten 20 gun frigates, it was impossible for him to prevent this by force. He knew that De Caylus, who was a naval officer, was aware of this; but upon Holburne's remonstrances the fortifications were dismantled and the garrison withdrawn. Holburne returned to England in 1752. On 5 February 1755 he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, and in the following May, with his flag in the <i>Terrible</i>, he sailed with a strong squadron to reinforce Vice-Admiral Edward Boscawen, whom he met off Louisbourg on 21 June, and with whom he returned to England in November. In 1756, with his flag still in the <i>Terrible</i>, he commanded in the third post in the fleet under Hawke or Boscawen off Brest and in the Bay of Biscay, and in the following January he sat as a member of the court martial on Admiral John Byng. On 24 February 1757 Holburne was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and on 7 May, after many delays, he sailed from Cork with a fleet of ships of war and transports intended for the reduction of Louisbourg, which had been restored to the French by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It was not, however, until 9 July that the expedition reached Halifax, Nova Scotia. By this date the French had taken advantage of the delay to strengthen the garrison and to collect a numerous fleet. Holburne, in consultation with the general, the earl of Loudoun, decided that nothing could be done without more force. As the season wore on, he determined to parade his fleet before Louisbourg, possibly in the hope that the French would accept his challenge. However, the French fleet, its crews weakened by disease, remained in port. While Holburne waited on the coast his fleet was caught on the night of 24 September by a violent storm, which drove some of the ships on shore, and wholly or in part dismasted almost all. After such refit as was possible Holburne returned to England, where he arrived in the beginning of December. A few days later he was appointed to the command in chief at &#145;that villainous&#146; Portsmouth  (Rodger, 32) a charge which he held either continuously or more probably with a break for the very unusual term of eight years, the latter part of the time being enlivened by a curious inquiry into an alleged plot in November 1764 to set fire to all the dockyards. The several commanders-in-chief and resident commissioners were ordered to investigate the matter; but this was done with the utmost secrecy, and the report cannot now be found.<br>
<br>During the Seven Years' War Holburne continued to have good relations with Admiral Hawke. These persisted well into Hawke's term as first lord of the Admiralty (1766&#150;71). Boscawen's earlier view of Holburne was less favourable: &#145;I don't like him, nor ever did&#146;  (Mackay, 138); and in 1758 Lord Anson thought him subversive, an opinion that probably drew something from Holburne's Scottish origins and his failure to adopt English &#145;manners&#146; as befitted a naval officer. On 5 August 1767 Holburne attained the rank of admiral of the blue, and on 28 October 1770 admiral of the white; about the same time he was appointed rear-admiral of Great Britain. He was one of the lords of the Admiralty from February 1770 to January 1771, when he accepted the post of governor of Greenwich Hospital. He died at the hospital on 15 July 1771.<br>
<br>Holburne had married at Barbados the widow of Edward Lascelles, collector of customs for the island; they had one son, Francis, who in 1772 succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his cousin, Sir Alexander, third baronet.<br>
