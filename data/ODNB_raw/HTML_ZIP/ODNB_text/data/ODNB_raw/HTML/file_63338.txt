<span class="headword">Gulliver,  James Gerald</span>  (1930&#150;1996), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 17 August 1930 at 18 Smith Drive, Campbeltown, Argyll, the youngest child and only son of William Frederick Gulliver, master grocer, and his wife, Mary Lafferty. His father ran a successful business, and as a child Gulliver delivered groceries on the traditional errand boy's bicycle to his father's customers. He was dux (head boy) of Campbeltown grammar school and gained a first-class honours degree in mathematics and engineering at Glasgow University. He was awarded a Fulbright scholarship and finished his education at Georgia Institute of Technology. Subsequently he completed a short service commission in the Royal Navy (1956&#150;9) before joining the management consultancy Urwick, Orr, &amp; Partners in 1961. On 22 November 1958 he married Margaret Joan Cormack (<i>b</i>. 1930/31), a state registered nurse and daughter of John Godfrey Cormack, a medical practitioner. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Gulliver's abilities were first recognized by Garfield Weston, chairman of Associated British Foods. During the 1960s Weston sought to parallel in Britain his success in Canada with the development of a diversified food manufacturing and retailing group. Associated British Foods had created through acquisition the Fine Fare group of food stores and, in order to control Fine Fare's store development programme Weston also owned a building company, Headway. Gulliver was recruited to manage Headway and he did so with such effect that Weston, in a typically bold move, appointed him in 1965 managing director of Fine Fare. At that time Fine Fare was struggling to compete with Tesco and Sainsbury's, then a strong southern regional company.<br>
<br>With great concentration and energy Gulliver became directly responsible for every aspect of Fine Fare's activities. He quickly grasped that a retail company had two prime constituents&#151;the customer and the supplier. He engaged at a high level with the key food manufacturers to convince them that Fine Fare would become a major and countervailing force in food retailing. Despite Weston's misgivings, Gulliver cancelled Fine Fare's contract with Pink Stamps and invested the savings in sharper pricing and heavier advertising. Gulliver's success at Fine Fare prompted Weston to invite him to tackle the problems faced by Loblaws stores in Canada. During 1972 Gulliver contributed strongly to Loblaws' revival but increasingly felt that his future should be as an entrepreneur (a word which became his leitmotif).<br>
<br>In late 1972 Gulliver left Fine Fare, and he and two close associates, Alistair Grant and David Webster, acquired an investment in Oriel Foods, a small quoted food company with interests in edible oil refining and food wholesaling. Swiftly Gulliver then acquired cash and carry, retailing, and wholesaling businesses during 1973. To his surprise he was approached by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the large US conglomerate, which was interested in purchasing Oriel. In January 1974 Gulliver sold Oriel to RCA and became a comparatively wealthy man. For three years he and his team continued to run Oriel, with one important new acquisition, Morris and David Jones, which doubled Oriel's scale and profitability.<br>
<br>In 1977 Gulliver left Oriel and set up James Gulliver Associates, which later became Argyll Group plc and eventually Safeway plc. From a small capital base Gulliver acquired significant financial interests in and effective management control of four small quoted companies: Alpine Holdings, Morgan Edwards, Louis C. Edwards, and Amalgamated Distilled Products. Each was used as the core of a discrete sectoral development programme. Alpine was sold in 1983 for a substantial profit. Morgan Edwards and Louis C. Edwards were merged in 1981, and soon afterwards Gulliver re-acquired Oriel Foods from RCA and swiftly concluded his most important deal, the acquisition of James Goldsmith's Allied Suppliers, a large supermarket business making profits of only &pound;11 million from sales of &pound;940 million. Allied Suppliers provided Gulliver and his team with the scale which enabled him to exploit the lessons learned at Fine Fare. Over a three-year period net margins were tripled and within five years pre-tax profits rose to &pound;70 million.<br>
<br>Modelling his ambitions on his mentor Garfield Weston, Gulliver saw that while food retailing provided an excellent business in the UK, if he wished to become a large international group the preferred strategy would be to acquire a branded consumer product business, where sales expansion would not be dependent upon real estate. He and his team decided that Scotland's premier company Distillers was grossly under-exploiting the array of liquor brands within its portfolio. As a Scot, Gulliver&#151;supported by his two Scottish associates Grant and Webster&#151;reasoned that although Distillers was considered impregnable to a hostile bid from outside Scotland, Argyll could perhaps finesse its acquisition by stressing the need for Distillers to be truly directed from Scotland rather than from its palatial St James's Square headquarters. He also reasoned that the model for the development of Distillers was cognac, which earned 40 per cent of the profit earned by Scotch whisky from 10 per cent of its sales volume, through skilful marketing and exploitation of its heritage. To give Amalgamated Distilled Products the required scale and muscle, Gulliver created the Argyll Group, by using James Gulliver Associates as the vehicle for the merger of the now substantial food interests with the rather smaller drinks business.<br>
<br>In August 1985 Gulliver discussed the feasibility of acquiring Distillers through the medium of a friendly journalist. The resulting press speculation forced Gulliver, with advice from the city, to state that he had no immediate intention of making an offer. The Takeover Panel ruled that Argyll would be precluded from making a move for at least three months. Alerted, Distillers began to prepare its defence; and, more importantly, Guinness, under Ernest Saunders, realized that if Gulliver made a move, Distillers would be in play and might prefer a white knight with a 200-year-old pedigree to an aggressive Scottish predator. Argyll's formal offer for Distillers, launched on 2 December 1985, was the signal for Guinness to present itself as a preferred suitor, even persuading Distillers to finance its bid costs. After a series of manoeuvres, some underhand and some illegal, Guinness captured Distillers in April 1986. Gulliver, at that time unaware of the Guinness &#145;dirty tricks&#146; campaign, wrote to Saunders wishing him success.<br>
<br>During 1986 Gulliver once again decided to pursue a range of private business interests and became non-executive chairman of Argyll, retiring from the board two years later after the acquisition of Safeway from its US owners. He made his home in Scotland and gained great enjoyment from farming his land in Fife and decorating his town house in Heriot Row. His wide range of interests included serving as vice-president of Manchester United Football Club, trustee of the duke of Edinburgh's award scheme, and visiting professor at Glasgow University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1989. He was an enthusiastic and adventurous skier and a keen yachtsman. He was <span class="italic">Guardian</span> young businessman of the year in 1972, and was created CVO in 1996.<br>
<br>Gulliver's first three marriages ended in divorce. His second marriage, on 12 March 1977, was to Joanne Sims (<i>b</i>. 1946/7), secretary, daughter of Rufus Graham Sims, sales manager. His third marriage, on 3 April 1985, was to Marjorie Hazel Henderson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moncrieff (<i>b</i>. 1955/6), secretary and restaurateur, daughter of John Moncrieff, farmer. His fourth marriage, on 24 July 1993, was to Melanie Crossley (<i>b</i>. 1963), chartered accountant, daughter of John Crossley, carpet retailer. He died at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 12 September 1996, and was survived by his wife Melanie and the five children of his first marriage.<br>
