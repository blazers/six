<span class="headword">Ferings,  Richard  of</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1253, <em>d.</em> 1306), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin</span>, belonged to a family originating either in Feering, Essex, or Ferring, Sussex, to judge from his name. He studied for a doctorate in canon law at Oxford and in November 1267 his name appears as one of the northern scholars who signed the terms of peace between Irish and northern scholars at Oxford. His early ecclesiastical career was spent in the Canterbury province and as official of Canterbury he won the friendship of Archbishop Pecham. In 1279 he was present at the Council of Reading. In 1280 he was also for a short time official of Winchester, having been appointed by Pecham during a vacancy of the bishopric; but before long Pecham found him so indispensable that he brought him back to Canterbury, and put Adam of Hales into the post at Winchester. He is found as archdeacon of Canterbury early in 1282 although no record of his appointment survives. In 1284 Pecham gave him the rectory of Tunstall, near Sittingbourne, to be held <i>in commendam</i> with the archdeaconry. Following Pecham's death in 1292 Ferings was involved in a dispute over the administration of the province and diocese of Canterbury <i>sede vacante</i> which involved his presence in Rome. In 1299 he was provided to a prebend in Lincoln by Pope Boniface VIII who called him papal chaplain. In the same year this pontiff appointed him to the archbishopric of Dublin. The feuds of the two rival chapters of Holy Trinity and St Patrick's had long made the elections to that see constant subjects of disputes. In 1297 William Hothum, himself a nominee of the pope after a contested election, died soon after his consecration. Early in 1298 Holy Trinity elected Adam of Belsham, and St Patrick's chose their dean, Thomas Chadworth, for whom the canons had previously tried to secure the archbishopric. In their hurry neither body had secured the royal licence to elect. Both were accordingly summoned to answer for the contempt, and the temporalities of Holy Trinity were for a time seized by King Edward. Ferings's appointment by the pope was consequently not opposed by the king. His consecration probably took place abroad, as it is not noticed in the English authorities, though the date is given as 1299 in the annals of Ireland  (Gilbert, 2.291). It was not until June 1300, however, that Ferings received from the crown the temporalities of his see, after a renunciation of all the words in the bull of appointment that were prejudicial to the royal authority.<br>
<br>Ferings spent little of his time in Ireland. His conciliatory temper led him to several attempts to make peace with disappointed candidates and angry chapters. Even before his consecration he had appointed his old rival, Thomas Chadworth, his vicar, though he subsequently feared lest the infirmities of age made him unfit for the post, and urged the canons of St Patrick's and Chadworth himself to recommend a fit substitute if he were incapable. In 1301 he confirmed the composition of peace agreed between the canons of St Patrick's and the monks of Holy Trinity which, while recognizing that both churches were of metropolitical and cathedral rank, gave Holy Trinity, as the elder foundation, a certain honorary precedence. He continued to make Chadworth his vicar-general during his frequent absences abroad. While resident in his diocese Ferings concerned himself particularly with the administration of his secular cathedral. The first known visitation of St Patrick's occurred during his episcopacy and he issued a charter concerning future visitations. These were to be conducted through the dean who alone would be responsible for making correction. Procurations were to be limited to 10 marks. In 1304 from his manor at Swords, Ferings issued an ordinance exempting the prebendal churches from the visitations of dean and archdeacon. In 1303 he endowed St Patrick's with the two new prebends of Stagonil and Tipperkevin, the latter of which supported two prebendaries. He incurred the king's displeasure for removing a royal clerk from the church of Tipperkevin because he was not ordained, and was summoned before the justiciar to answer. The result of this case is not known. In 1302 he resigned to Edmund Butler the manor of Hollywood, near Dublin, which had for some time been in the possession of the see. In 1303 Ferings was summoned to the English parliament in his capacity as archbishop of Dublin. His absence from Ireland was so far recognized by the king that he gave Ferings special permission to have the revenues of his see sent to England for his support. In July 1304 he was granted protection for two years to visit the Roman curia. He died on 17 October 1306.<br>
