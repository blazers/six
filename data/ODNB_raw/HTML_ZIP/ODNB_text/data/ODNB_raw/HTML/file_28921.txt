<span class="headword">Webbe,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em>1581, <em>d.</em> in or before 1642), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Limerick</span>, was born in 1581, the third son of Hugh Webbe, rector of Bromham, Wiltshire. He entered University College, Oxford, in April 1598, and migrated to Corpus Christi College as a scholar. He was admitted BA in February 1602 and MA in June 1605. Soon after he was inducted as vicar of Steeple Ashton, Wiltshire, on 15 May 1605, seemingly on the presentation of the earl of Pembroke. He married some time before the birth of his son Theophilus in 1607. Webbe kept a grammar school at Steeple Ashton and also at Bath, where he was rector of St Peter and St Paul from 1621 to 1634, when his son succeeded him. Appointed a chaplain to James VI and I before 1621, he was made DD in 1623.<br>
<br>Webbe was a man of strict life and conversation, and a distinguished preacher, both in his parish, at Paul's Cross, and at court; the portrait of him by Thomas Slater catches him unawares &#145;As he in Pulpit did discharge his place&#146;  (AH, frontispiece and sonnet, in G. Webbe, <span class="italic">The Practice of Quietness</span>, 1705). <span class="italic">God's Controversie with England</span> (1609), his first sermon at Paul's Cross, &#145;the chiefest Watchtower in the land&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>) has been seen as within the Jacobean tradition of exposition of <span class="roman">Hosea</span>, as established by John Downame in his 1608 lectures, using that prophet to explore God's relations with England. It also reflected Webbe's close association with the likes of Richard Rogers, William Perkins, and Richard Greenham, with whom he later published one of the most successful early Stuart handbooks of devotion, <span class="italic">A Garden of Spirituall Flowers</span>, in 1616; some thirty imprints and editions appeared by 1630. Webbe's own popularity as a preacher can be gauged from the 1613 epithalamion homily he dedicated to Princess Elizabeth, <span class="italic">The Bride Royall, or, The Spirituall Marriage between Christ and his Church</span> (1613) and in six other Steeple Ashton sermons, gathered in 1610 as <span class="italic">A Poesie of Spirituall Flowers</span>. Convinced that &#145;experience sheweth how little preaching profiteth where catechising is neglected&#146;, he published <span class="italic">A Brief Exposition of the Principles of the Christian Religion</span> (1612), a catechism for the primary use of his parishioners  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). His <span class="italic">Catalogus protestantium, or, The Protestants Kalendar</span> (1624) surveyed &#145;the protestants religion long before Luthers daies&#146; in the light of the Spanish match. He enjoyed the friendship of the lord chief justice, Sir Henry Hobart, to whom he dedicated his most popular series of sermons, <span class="italic">The Practice of Quietness</span>, in June 1615. It ran to six editions before Webbe expanded it in 1638.<br>
<br>Charles I, with Archbishop Laud's approval, selected Webbe for promotion to the bench at the age of fifty-three. On the death of his fellow Wiltshireman Francis Gough he was nominated bishop of Limerick, despite the support of the archbishop of Armagh and the lords justices for the dean, George Andrews (later bishop of Ferns and Leighlin). William Prynne later used Webbe's appointment as part of his attack on Laud for allegedly usurping the royal prerogative. He was consecrated in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 18 December 1634. Eight days earlier Lord Deputy Wentworth had put pressure on the convocation of the Church of Ireland to accept the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and the 1604 canons of the Church of England (proceedings challenged by George Andrews). With the outbreak of the 1641 rising Webbe was imprisoned by insurgent sympathizers within the city and had died of prison fever at Limerick Castle, by 22 June 1642. He was buried in St Munchin's churchyard, but apparently his remains were dug up twenty-four hours later by persons hoping to find jewels, then reinterred in the same place. He was succeeded, on 7 April 1643, by another Englishman, Robert Sibthorp, bishop of Kilfenora, whom the Irish bishops had unsuccessfully petitioned Charles to make bishop of Ossory in 1640.<br>
