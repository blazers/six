<span class="headword">Steinitz,  (Charles) Paul Joseph</span>  (1909&#150;1988), <span class="occ">conductor and musicologist</span>, was born on 25 August 1909 in Chichester, Sussex, the son of the Revd Charles Steinitz, a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Sarah Jessie Prior. He was educated privately, and in the late 1920s entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied the organ with Stanley Marchant. At the academy he was a contemporary of Walter Emery, whose work in establishing authentic texts of the music of J. S. Bach and their interpretation, including his <span class="italic">The Matthew Passion: its Preparation and Performance</span> (1949), was to be an important influence on Steinitz. He also had private lessons from the composer George Oldroyd, organist and choirmaster of St Michael's, West Croydon. On 19 April 1933 he married Joan Mary (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of Charles Henry Paxton, civil engineer; they had two sons. While holding the post of director of music at the parish church in Ashford, Kent, from 1933 to 1942, he graduated BMus from London University in 1935, and was awarded the degree of DMus in 1940 for a symphony in D. His first marriage ended in divorce, and on 28 June 1946 he married Margery Hope (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), daughter of Sydney Howard Still, schoolmaster; they had one daughter. From 1949 to 1961 he was organist and choirmaster at the priory church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield, London.<br>
<br>In 1947 Steinitz founded a choir, the South London Bach Society, and in 1952 at St Bartholomew-the-Great he conducted the choir, by then known as the London Bach Society, in the first complete performance in Great Britain of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span> sung in the original German, an event which soon gave rise to the tradition of annual performances of Bach's <span class="roman">St Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">St John</span> passions. Always concerned to perform the music authentically, for the next thirty-five years he applied the latest ideas about performance practice. He founded the Steinitz Bach Players in 1969, although at first they did not use &#145;period&#146; instruments because his choir was too large to be accompanied by a small period-instrument ensemble. But in the early 1970s he began to use smaller groups of voices with period instruments, using the full choir only when appropriate.<br>
<br>While his greatest commitment was to the music of J. S. Bach, and he became one of the leading British authorities on the composer, Steinitz also performed the works of Bach's predecessors, especially Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz, and Bach's contemporaries, including Handel. His repertory was, however, not confined to the baroque period, and he conducted many performances of twentieth-century music, including works by Geoffrey Burgon, Anthony Milner, and Stanley Glasser. The London Bach Society commissioned Edmund Rubbra's <span class="italic">Song of the Soul</span> (1952) and new works from Nicholas Maw (a former pupil) and John Tavener, who wrote <span class="italic">Introit for March 27: the Feast of St Damascene</span> (1968) to celebrate the society's twenty-first anniversary. The society gave the first performances of Tavener's <span class="italic">Three Holy Sonnets of John Donne</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Cain and Abel</span> (1966), Milner's <span class="italic">Benedic, anima mea, Dominum</span> (1954), and works by Bruno Maderna and Peter Maxwell Davies. In 1963 Steinitz conducted the British premi&egrave;re of Luigi Dallapiccola's <span class="italic">Canti di prigionia</span> (1938&#150;41), and in 1967 he gave a notable performance of Schoenberg's <span class="italic">Friede auf Erden</span>. Steinitz and the London Bach Society toured widely in Europe and North America, and he was also a guest conductor in New Zealand in 1970 and Australia in 1971. The works he recorded include the complete <span class="italic">Cantiones sacrae</span> of 1625 by Sch&uuml;tz, and he made many BBC broadcasts from 1949 onwards.<br>
<br>Steinitz was professor of harmony and composition at the Royal Academy of Music from 1945 to 1984, and from 1984 he was a consultant professor. He was also a lecturer at Goldsmiths' College, London, from 1948 to 1976, and published several books on harmony, including <span class="italic">Harmony and Counterpoint with the Masters</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Commonsense Harmony</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">Harmony in Context</span> (1976). His approach to the teaching of harmony was to get his students to study the music of great composers, rather than to write exercises, and to this end he published <span class="italic">One Hundred Tunes for Harmonisation from the Great Masters</span> (1963). He also wrote the chapter on German church music in <span class="italic">Opera and Church Music, 1630&#150;1750</span> (1975), published as volume 5 of the <span class="italic">New Oxford History of Music</span>. His other publications include <span class="italic">Bach's Passions</span> (1979), with a chapter on performance style, <span class="italic">Bach for Choirs</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">Performing Bach's Vocal Music</span> (1980).<br>
<br>Steinitz's second marriage, like the first, ended in divorce, and in 1976 he married Margaret Johnson. A Quaker, despite his Anglican upbringing, Steinitz believed that music could heal political divisions, and he made two visits to East Germany, in 1964 and 1983. In December 1987, four months before his death, he completed the project that he had begun with the London Bach Society in 1958, the performance of all the cantatas of J. S. Bach. Steinitz was appointed OBE in 1985, the tercentenary of Bach's birth. He died on 21 April 1988 at his home, 73 High Street, Old Oxted, Surrey, and was buried on 3 May after a funeral in Chichester Cathedral.<br>
