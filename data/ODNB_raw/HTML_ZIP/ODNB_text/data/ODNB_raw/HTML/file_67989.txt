<span class="headword">Mansel <span class="st"> [Mansell]</span>, Sir  Rice</span>  (1487&#150;1559), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was born in Oxwich in the Gower peninsula, Glamorgan, on 25 January 1487. His father was Jenkin Mansel, known as &#145;the Valiant&#146; (<i>fl</i>. 1450&#150;1510), and his mother was Edith (<i>fl</i>. 1450&#150;1510), daughter of Sir George Kene, a knight of Kent. The family estate, in west Gower, had been built up over two centuries by careful management and prudent marriages. It had been forfeited in 1464 when an act of attainder was passed against Philip Mansel (Rice's grandfather) for conspiring with Jasper Tudor against the Yorkist cause. Jenkin (Rice's father) recovered the estate soon after the battle of Bosworth which suggests that he had fought for Henry Tudor at that battle. Jenkin was a client of the powerful Rhys ap Thomas of Dinefwr and may have named his son after him.<br>
<br>In his youth Rice Mansel was placed under the guardianship of his uncle Sir Mathew Cradock, a naval commander and prosperous Swansea merchant, and from 1509 was entrusted with the charge of a number of ships bearing the Cradock family name. Rice received seisin of his estates from his guardian in 1510 and on 17 May in the following year married Eleanor, daughter of James Bassett of Beaupr&eacute;, the first of his three wives, who died in or just before 1520.<br>
<br>The record of Mansel's career between 1513 and 1526 is virtually a blank, apart from a mention of his service with the earl of Worcester in Flanders in 1517. His knighthood, however, granted in 1526, when he was still comparatively young, points to his having served with distinction as a soldier and administrator in the royal pay. His private life at this period is better documented. In 1520 he married his second wife, Anne Brydges, who bore two daughters. His third marriage, in 1527, to Cecily (<i>d</i>. 1558), daughter of John Daubridgecourt of Solihull, forged an intimate link with the court, for Cecily was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Mary (the future queen) and the friendly connection between them continued after Cecily's marriage and Mary's accession.<br>
<br>Mansel played a conspicuous part in suppressing the rebellion of Thomas Fitzgerald, Lord Offaly, in Ireland in 1534&#150;5. The English commander, Sir William Skeffington, wrote that &#145;Sir Rice Mansel with his band &hellip; has done right good exploits and acceptable service&#146;  (Maunsell and Statham, 1.299). Mansel was among the first to enter the fortress of Maynooth after a five-day bombardment had breached the walls, probably the first time heavy artillery had been used for such purposes in Ireland. His wife pleaded with Thomas Cromwell to allow him to return, on the grounds that &#145;most of his living is encumbered with jointures and other charges, so that if God should take him, I and my children are undone&#146;  (Maunsell and Statham, 1.302). Mansel's successes in Ireland brought him to the favourable notice of the king and his ministers, for in 1536 he was made chamberlain of Chester. He also became a member of the council in the marches of Wales, and was placed on the commission of the peace for a number of counties and pricked as sheriff of Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Mansell, though a religious conservative, was probably not over-concerned with the niceties of theology and had no compunction about profiting from the dissolution of the monasteries. He obtained a lease of the site of the abbey of Margam in 1537, and between 1540 and 1557 he purchased the site of the abbey and much of its estate in four instalments for a total sum of &pound;2482 13<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. His investment tripled the acreage of his estate and secured him a place in the first rank of the landed society of south Wales. Leaving his new residence at Oxwich Castle for his son and heir, Edward, to complete, he set about converting the domestic buildings of the abbey, together with its fine chapter house, into a mansion which became his principal home and survived until its demolition in 1792&#150;3. He dismantled the monks' choir and presbytery, leaving the former lay brothers' nave to function as the parish church.<br>
<br>When war with France and Scotland was resumed in 1542, Mansel as vice-admiral engaged the French rather unsuccessfully in the channel; and in 1544 as knight marshal he led a commando-style raid against Rothesay Castle on the Isle of Bute. His wife's friendship with the Catholic Princess Mary may have prompted Mansel to keep a low profile during the radically protestant reign of Edward VI, but when Mary succeeded to the throne he was rewarded for his services and loyalty with the offices of chamberlain and chancellor of south Wales and the counties of Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, as well as the stewardships of many manors and lordships. These offices gave him the power and status of the chief royal representative in south Wales and the influence once enjoyed by the family's patron, Rhys ap Thomas of Dinefwr.<br>
<br>While Mansel's son Edward was defending the family's interests against George Herbert in a celebrated affray at Oxwich Castle in 1557, Rice was raising troops against the French. They were never used. Mary died, peace was restored, and before the new queen, Elizabeth, could reverse the religious changes of the previous reign, Mansel himself died at his town house in Clerkenwell on 10 April 1559. He was given an elaborate Catholic-style funeral and buried at St Bartholomew-the-Great, west Smithfield, a dissolved Augustinian priory, only recently restored as a Dominican priory by Queen Mary. No grave marker now survives, nor does a portrait; but his likeness has been preserved in the effigy on his fine tomb at Margam Abbey church. Three versions of his will are extant and two poems in his praise by the bard Iorwerth Fynglwyd (<i>d</i>. 1527).<br>
