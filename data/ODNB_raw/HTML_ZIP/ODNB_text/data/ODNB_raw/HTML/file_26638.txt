</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Strange, Sir  Robert</span>  (1721&#150;1792), <span class="occ">line-engraver</span>, was born on 14 July 1721, the eldest son of David Strange, of Kirkwall in the Orkneys, and his second wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scollay. In 1736, after a brief flirtation with the law, he was apprenticed to the engraver Richard Cooper in Edinburgh. Strange completed his apprenticeship in 1742, having worked on anatomical plates of bones for the folio edition of Bernard Albinus's <span class="italic">Tables of the Skeleton and Muscles of the Human Body</span>, projected by Cooper and the surgeon Alexander Monro, and engraved plates to illustrate Monro's articles in <span class="italic">Medical Essays</span>. No signed plates survive, but as an apprentice Strange's work would normally have passed as Cooper's. In the early 1740s he fell in love with Isabella Lumisden (1719&#150;1806), whose brother became private secretary to James Francis Edward Stuart. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Strange joined Prince Charles Edward's lifeguard at her desire, designed Jacobite currency, and was with the prince at Culloden. His engraving of a portrait of the prince, by Allan Ramsay, became an important image in Jacobite propaganda in 1745&#150;6. He married Isabella Lumisden clandestinely in 1747. A daughter, Mary Bruce, was baptized in March 1748. After the <span class="roman">Act of Grace</span>, Strange went briefly to Rouen, a centre for exiled Jacobites, where he won a prize for drawing. He then went to work for Jacques Philippe Le Bas in Paris, dining with him for the first time on 19 June 1749.<br>
<br>In 1750 the historian George Vertue noted that Strange was about to move from Paris to London and then that he was about to publish a print after Carl Vanloo. Strange took lodgings with a pewterer in Parliament Street, Westminster, where he was joined by Isabella and Mary, and from where he began to publish and to deal in prints. One of his first advertised works was a specimen plate for William Hunter's projected &#145;Anatomy of the pregnant uterus&#146;. He imported prints from Rome through his brother-in-law Andrew Lumisden and Piranesi, and from Paris through Le Bas and others. In 1753 James III stood godfather to his eldest son, James Charles Stuart Strange. But Strange had also begun to make his peace with the Hanoverian regime: his third publication, <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1753), after Guido Reni, was dedicated to the widowed princess of Wales. Three more prints from paintings from the Royal Collection (<span class="italic">The Three Children of Charles I</span>, after Van Dyck, <span class="italic">St Agnes</span>, after Domenchino, and <span class="italic">Views Attired by the Graces</span>, after Guido) were published in 1758 and 1760. Lumisden wrote: &#145;I know your prudence will make the best use of what has happened without giving anyone just reason to say that a change of fortune has produced in you a change of sentiment&#146;  (Dennistoun, 1.246). In 1754 Strange moved to Henrietta Street, Covent Garden.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinEurope"></a>Travels in Europe</h2>That same year Strange visited Paris, unearthed Dorigny's famous copperplates of Raphael's <span class="italic">Transfiguration</span> and its companion, and, back in London, printed a new edition. With Lumisden's help he began to lay plans to travel to Italy to make drawings of fine paintings for publication and to buy paintings for profit. His itinerary had been mapped and his targets identified when, in 1758, Allan Ramsay asked Strange to engrave his portraits of the prince of Wales and of Lord Bute. Strange was embarrassed. Not wishing to offend either his Jacobite or his Hanoverian patrons, he tried to refuse politely, citing his plans to travel and to base a career on historical engravings rather than portraiture. The prince's miserly offer, conveyed by Sir William Chambers, of 100 guineas for work that would occupy at least two years failed to alter Strange's determination. But he was unnerved when Ramsay told him that the prince had taken his refusal very badly and that Lord Bute had said, &#145;it is a thing we are determined never to forgive&#146;  (Dennistoun, 1.274). The courtiers let it be known that they were convinced that Strange had refused for political reasons. Strange tried to justify himself to Bute but was denied access, and, he later wrote, &#145;reports were spread greatly to my disadvantage&#146;  (Strange, <span class="italic">Inquiry</span>, 13), doing immediate damage to his current subscription. Now departure for the continent was expedient, and, after exhibiting twelve prints and ten drawings in May 1760, Strange left for Paris <i>en route</i> for Rome, using a passport through France (then at war with Britain) organized by Lumisden. During his absence his wife managed his business and marketed his prints from their house.<br>
<br>At Paris in August Strange visited an old acquaintance, the famous German engraver Johann Georg Wille, who gave him letters of recommendation to Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Anton Raphael Mengs. Horace Walpole had recommended Strange to Horace Mann in Florence as &#145;a very first-rate artist, and by far our best &hellip; tho you will not approve of his politics&#146;  (Dennistoun, 1.277). He was warmly welcomed in Rome, and was made a member of the academies of Florence and Naples. Strange's first seventeen plates had won him an international reputation as an engraver of the first rank. Indeed, an article published in the leading German-language review journal in 1762 considered him &#145;indisputably the greatest master that Britain has ever produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bibliothek der sch&ouml;nen Wissenschaften und der freyen K&uuml;nste</span>, 7, 1762, 369). From Naples, Strange went on in 1763 to Parma, where he dined with the first minister, du Tillot, and was made a professor of the academy. He continued to Bologna, where Winckelmann admired his drawings, but there he found that George III's librarian, Richard Dalton, had hired a promising Italian, Francesco Bartolozzi, to make drawings of the paintings that Strange intended to publish. Strange obtained revenge by buying for Sir Lawrence Dundas a painting that Dalton had drawn for approval and potential purchase by the king. But he perceived a new threat in his talented rival. He determined to engrave the painting to invite direct comparison with Bartolozzi. &#145;You may be sure I wish in every shape for an opportunity to appear in the same subjects with Bartolozzi&#146;, he wrote to Lumisden, &#145;his plates being intended for England and, [I] have reason to believe, himself also&#146;  (Dennistoun, 2.10). Strange then presented himself for acceptance by the Academy of St Luke in Rome and by the Royal Academy at Paris as a painter, on the strength of his drawings. Thus fortified with marks of continental respect he returned to London in time for the 1765 exhibition, having just been made a fellow of the newly incorporated Society of Artists. He set up a new home at 14 Castle Street, Leicester Fields.<h2>
<a name="Buildingareputation"></a>Building a reputation</h2>Now Strange found further evidence that the clique of artists in favour with Lord Bute and the king were still determined to obstruct his smooth passage to celebrity and prosperity. He exhibited and published two prints after Raphael's <span class="italic">Justice</span> and <span class="italic">Meekness</span> in the Vatican. For some time he had been nervous about &#145;that ugly creature the ostridge&#146; in <span class="italic">Justice</span>, which, he worried, &#145;will make a ridiculous appearance, and may be an object of derision to those who are fond of cavilling, though it may bear the name of Raphael&#146;  (Dennistoun, 2.25). His fears proved well founded. A few days after publication there appeared in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> &#145;a long and elaborate performance taking to pieces these prints, in order to depreciate them in the esteem of the public&#146;  (ibid., 2.29). Criticism centred on the ostrich. Strange was in no doubt that the vituperative remarks came from Chambers or Dalton or one of their associates among the courtier directors of the Society of Artists. He then tried to exhibit the Italian drawings that Winckelmann had considered &#145;the most beautiful that I have ever seen in my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bibliothek der sch&ouml;nen Wissenschaften und der freyen K&uuml;nste</span>, 11, 1764, 369), only to find them rejected by the same directors. He helped to oust the offending directors in 1768, but discovered that they had already laid plans to found a royal academy. Strange himself was a director from 1768 to 1773. The new academy excluded engravers from membership and, to add insult to injury, accepted Bartolozzi as a painter on the strength of his drawings. Strange, with a degree of vanity perhaps, judged these measures to be aimed at him personally.<br>
<br>Ironically, Strange's own instincts were of an academic kind. &#145;It is only by studying and meditating upon the works of the Italian masters that we can reasonably expect to form a true taste, and to defend ourselves against the destructive and capricious sorcery of fashion&#146;, he wrote in <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of a Collection of Pictures</span>  (pp. ii&#150;iii). This was published in 1769 to accompany his exhibition of paintings that he had bought and drawings that he had made in Italy. These imports that he exhibited and sold included some fine and valuable paintings, such as the <span class="italic">Landscape with a Snake</span> by Poussin, bought by Sir William Watkins Wynne in 1773. Strange's knowledge of the Italian schools made him a valued expert adviser to a circle of collectors, including Sir Lawrence Dundas and William Hunter.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Strange exhibited with the Society of Artists from 1768 until its financial crisis in 1775. With Stubbs, Mortimer, Paine, Pine, and Woollett, he wrote <span class="italic">The conduct of the Royal Academicians, while members of the Incorporated Society of Artists of Great Britain</span> (1771) and followed this up with a more personal account, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Rise and Establishment of the Royal Academy of Arts</span> (1775). After the society collapsed Strange moved to the rue d'Enfer, Paris, and spent the next five years in France.<h2>
<a name="Royalpatronage"></a>Royal patronage</h2>Strange returned to London in 1780 and bought a house at 52 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields; he insured the contents for the substantial sum of &pound;2800, a figure raised to &pound;3400 a year later. Soon after his return, Benjamin West effected a rapprochement with the king. Strange engraved a portrait of Charles I from the French royal collection, and in 1784 he was presented to the king and queen of France. As a companion he was allowed to engrave a portrait of Charles's queen, Henrietta Maria, from the British Royal Collection, and, from the same source, West's <span class="italic">Apotheosis of Prince Alfred and Prince Octavius</span>. He took the painting to Paris to work on it and was knighted in 1787 when he presented the result to George III. After an illness in 1788 Strange decided to destroy his plates to prevent their exploitation, but was persuaded not to as their continued existence&#151;they were then valued at &pound;10,000&#151;provided insurance for his family. Strange died in London on 5 July 1792.<br>
<br>Strange engraved with unusual clarity and delicacy and produced some beautiful prints, especially those after Titian, Correggio, and Van Dyck. His self-righteousness and his flair for self-publicity invited hostile attention, but not all of the criticism directed at him was fair. He was, for instance, accused of employing French journeymen on the mechanical parts of his plates, which was true, but all engravers used assistants. Strange's only crime was that his were French. If his work had a flaw, it was that he was not particularly good at conveying the distinctive styles of different masters that he translated. He was survived by two daughters, Mary and Katherine, and three sons, all of whom had careers in India. James went out with a writership in the East India Company to Madras, but subsequently became a banker in London; Thomas went to Canada as a lawyer, was also knighted by George III, and became the first professional recorder of Madras; Robert was an officer first in the Indian navy, then in the army. Sir Robert's vivacious widow, Isabella, retired to East Acton and died on 28 February 1806.<br>
