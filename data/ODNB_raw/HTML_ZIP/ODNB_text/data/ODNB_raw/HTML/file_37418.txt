<span class="headword">Fitzsimmons,  Robert <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1863&#150;1917), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 26 May 1863 in Wendron Street, Helston, Cornwall, the youngest child of the seven sons and five daughters of James Fitzsimmons, of Omagh, co. Tyrone, a police constable in the Helston borough police, and his wife, Jane Strongman of Truro, Cornwall. Fitzsimmons was educated at Helston national school until the family emigrated to New Zealand, probably in 1872, and settled in Timaru, South Island, where most of the settlers were of Cornish descent. James Fitzsimmons set up as a blacksmith, and Bob Fitzsimmons left school to become a butcher's delivery boy. After various jobs, including that of carriage painter, striker at an iron foundry, and house decorator, he joined his brother in the blacksmith's business.<br>
<br>Fitzsimmons's boxing career began in 1880, when he won a tournament organized by the bare-knuckle champion Jem Mace, who was touring New Zealand, and later defeated Mace's prot&eacute;g&eacute; the Maori Herbert Slade. He moved to Australia in 1883 and settled in Sydney, where he worked as a blacksmith. He won several contests, but in 1892 was defeated by Jim Hall in his attempt at the Australian middleweight title, in what may have been a rigged fight. Fitzsimmons sailed for San Francisco in 1890. His American career took off in 1891, when he beat Jack Dempsey, the Nonpareil, to win the world middleweight title. He also became a star of travelling variety shows, beginning with exhibition fights, but also appearing as an actor from 1893, when he played the lead in <span class="italic">A Man's a Man</span>. Meanwhile he was preparing to challenge James J. (Gentleman Jim) Corbett for the world heavyweight title. He knocked Corbett out in the fourteenth round at Carson City, Nevada, in 1897: the first reference to the &#145;solar-plexus punch&#146; came in a newspaper account of this contest. Fitzsimmons held the world heavyweight title until 1899; in 1903, when the light heavyweight division was created, he became the first to win world titles at three different weights when he became the world light heavyweight champion. He held this title until 1905, and continued to box until 1914. Fitzsimmons also published a book, <span class="italic">Physical Culture and Self Defence</span>, in 1902.<br>
<br>Bob Fitzsimmons was the only world heavyweight champion born in England, although he never fought there, and became an American citizen in 1893. He had a huge upper frame, with powerful shoulders developed during his early years at the anvil. Daniel Chester French used him as a model for his statue <span class="italic">Peace</span> for the Dewey Arch in New York. He was covered in freckles, hence his nickname Ruby Robert.<br>
<br>Fitzsimmons was married four times. His first wife was Louisa Johns of Timaru, whom he married in Australia on 14 October 1885; they had one son, born in Australia. They were divorced in 1893, and later in the same year he married Rose Julian, an acrobat, and moved to New York; they had two sons and a daughter. Rose died in 1903, and later that year Fitzsimmons married Julia May Gifford, a music hall entertainer. After their divorce in 1915 he married in the same year Mrs Temo Slomonin (1883&#150;1959), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ziller, born in Russia, of Portland, Oregon, the divorced wife of Henry Slomonin. She became an evangelist and persuaded Fitzsimmons to abandon the stage and join her as a travelling preacher. Bob Fitzsimmons died of pneumonia on 22 October 1917 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, and was buried in Graceland cemetery, Chicago.<br>
