<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Birley, Sir  Robert</span>  (1903&#150;1982), <span class="occ">headmaster and educational administrator</span>, was born on 14 July 1903 at Midnapore, India, the only son and elder child of Leonard Birley CSI CIE (1875&#150;1951) of the Indian Civil Service (Bengal), and his first wife, Grace Dalgleish, younger daughter of Maxwell Smyth, indigo planter, formerly of Moffat, Dumfriesshire. His mother died when he was three and he was brought up by his paternal grandparents in Bournemouth. He was educated at Rugby School (1917&#150;22) where he specialized in history and soon developed a taste for exploring its byways and oddities, which was stimulated by a tour of Europe between school and university, roaming about Italy, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. By a series of chances he had generally escaped external examinations, and this was to colour his approach to education later on. He went to Balliol College, Oxford (1922&#150;5, Brackenbury scholar in history), where he won the Gladstone memorial prize (1924) and obtained first-class honours in modern history (1925). Balliol nurtured the strong idealism in Birley's character.<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford, Birley joined the staff at Eton College, where he remained from 1926 to 1935, and married, in 1930, Elinor Margaret, daughter of Eustace Corrie Frere, architect; they had two daughters, Julia (1931&#150;1978) and Rachael (<i>b</i>. 1935). At Eton he made an immediate impact as an inspiring history teacher. He also startled some of the staff by putting the case for the strikers in the general strike of 1926 and organizing relief for the unemployed of Slough in 1931. He developed a lifelong absorption in the magnificent college library, from which he obtained much of his large store of often esoteric knowledge. He taught mainly the cleverer boys, introducing them to adult modes of thought and awakening their aesthetic sense. In all he made such an impression that on the retirement of C. A. Alington as headmaster in 1933 Birley was seriously suggested by some as his successor. But the post went to an older man, Claude Elliott, and soon Birley was made the headmaster of Charterhouse School, a post he held from 1935 to 1947.<br>
<br>As a young liberal-minded headmaster Birley had a stimulating effect in the school, and brought it into closer touch with the world of affairs. He believed that a headmaster should do as much teaching as possible. In addition to the contact with the pupils that this afforded, Birley and his wife encouraged individual boys, particularly those whom life was not treating well, with private hospitality, both in the school and at their holiday home in Somerset. Soon Charterhouse had to be guided through the war, and Birley stoutly resisted all pressures to remove it from Godalming.<br>
<br>Birley's public spirit made him a prominent member of the Headmasters' Conference. In 1942 he was appointed as its member on the government committee set up under Lord Fleming to bridge the gap between private and state education. He contributed much to the final report, and at the end of the war his reputation was such that he was appointed educational adviser to the military governor, Allied Control Commission for Germany (1947&#150;9). In Germany, Birley worked for reconciliation by bringing people together. He must be given a generous share of the credit for rebuilding the German educational system. He also played a leading part in setting up the K&ouml;nigswinter conferences, the first of which was held in 1950, by which Anglo-German understanding was strengthened and sustained.<br>
<br>In 1949 Birley became headmaster at Eton, where he remained until 1963. During his first term there he gave the Reith lectures, which were not a success. Historian that he was, he had a deep understanding of the historical role of Eton and a subtle appreciation of its special character. Birley was not a reforming headmaster, but under him respect grew for the intellect and the arts, and the teaching of science was improved and modernized. He realized the need for technologists in the second half of the twentieth century, and he felt that ideally they should be literate, go to church, and know Greek.<br>
<br>Birley soon became the most influential public school headmaster of his generation and he occupied the chair of the Headmasters' Conference for four years. He saw the main purpose of education as the encouragement of independent thought. The leisurely Eton education of his day, with its late specialization and freedom from the tyranny of the A-level syllabus, admirably suited this approach. However, towards the end of Birley's time some parents grew restive and there was a growing demand for paper qualifications, which he was unable to resist.<br>
<br>The next phase of Birley's life was as remarkable as it was unexpected. On a visit to South Africa, Birley's crusading zeal was aroused by the political and racial constraints in that country. He left Eton to become visiting professor of education at the University of the Witwatersrand (1964&#150;7). Tirelessly and single-mindedly he and his wife worked in their favourite cause, freedom of the spirit against repression and injustice. Their presence heartened liberals throughout South Africa and they made innumerable friends among both white and black people.<br>
<br>Birley filled one more important post on his return from South Africa, that of professor and head of the department of social science and the humanities at the City University, London (1967&#150;71).<br>
<br>6 feet 6 inches in height, clumsy and unathletic, with a shy smile and an increasing stoop, Birley was an imposing and compelling figure, particularly in his cassock and bands as headmaster of Eton. Incapable of small talk, he would launch into the serious topic of the moment with excited earnestness, livened by a keen sense of the absurd and a mischievousness which never lapsed into irresponsibility. Anyone so sure of his own rectitude could not fail to have his detractors, but his natural goodness and lofty ideals won the respect of most and the devotion of many. His effect on the moral and intellectual climate of his time was immense.<br>
<br>Birley was given many honours in his life, including honorary doctorates (one of them an Oxford DCL, 1972) at eight universities. He was appointed CMG (1950) and KCMG (1967) but not to the honour to which his talents and sense of service were perhaps best suited, namely a life peerage. He became an honorary fellow of Balliol in 1969. He died on 22 July 1982 at Somerton in Somerset.<br>
