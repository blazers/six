<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Broadbent,  Donald Eric</span>  (1926&#150;1993), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born on 6 May 1926 at 361 Station Road, Yardley, Birmingham, the youngest of the three children of Herbert Arthur Broadbent (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1890), accountant, and his wife, Hannah Elizabeth (Margie) Williams (1893&#150;1965), a secretary before her marriage. Although born in Birmingham he resolutely identified himself as Welsh, partly on grounds of ancestry but also because he spent much of his childhood there. His father worked as a sales manager for a multinational company. Although from a poor background he advanced rapidly, and the family was briefly affluent. But at the start of the Second World War he parted from both the company and the family, and Donald never saw him again. His mother &#145;was determined&#146;, wrote Broadbent:<blockquote>that never, under any circumstances would I later be handicapped in dealing with people who had a heavier ballast of educational advantage. So instead of getting me to the best schooling she could afford, she made up her mind with sublime arrogance as to which she thought was the best school in the country, and that was were I went: Winchester.</blockquote>His exhibition was not sufficient to cover all the fees, but his father's pension fund and the school made up the difference. He was steered towards classics by the school, with an assurance that he could follow it up with science. He did not feel at home with history, classics, or later the physical sciences. Already at school he developed an interest in social &#145;real world&#146; problems. The question of which career to pursue was cut short, apparently with some relief, by the imminence of military service.<br>
<br>Long fascinated by flying, Broadbent joined the Royal Air Force in 1944. He was first sent to Cambridge for a short engineering course, and later that year went into the RAF proper. In 1945 he sailed on the <i>Aquitania</i> to New York for flying training in the USA. His experience there had several important spin-offs. He became aware of the practical problems of equipment design in relation to human usage. He recounted how in the AT6, a plane with two identical levers close together under the seat, &#145;with monotonous regularity one or another of my colleagues would pull the wrong lever and drop an expensive airplane onto its belly in the middle of the field&#146;. He also noted the difficulty of reading instruments. A second spin-off was that his training put him in contact with students, and he discovered that psychology was a respectable subject in America. He had also been greatly impressed by the personnel selection battery used by the RAF, which had a concrete and practical quality untouched by his formal studies, and used the &#145;progressive matrices test&#146; when asked for an assessment of some airmen while still in the RAF.<br>
<br>On returning to Cambridge, to the surprise and suspicion of the admission committee at Pembroke College, Broadbent announced his determination to study psychology, despite the college's urging him to read chemistry. The college eventually relented and Broadbent joined Sir Frederick Bartlett's department. Bartlett had been actively involved in wartime research on human performance under various demanding, stressful conditions, and this was a context into which Broadbent fitted easily. Bartlett instilled a philosophy that psychological principles should derive from real-life situations whenever possible: that data should determine theory, rather than theory being used to search for data. Thirty years later Broadbent still found this approach &#145;sound and vital&#146;. A major influence in the department was the brilliant young Kenneth Craik, who died in a tragic accident just before Broadbent arrived, but the intellectual interest in &#145;cybernetic&#146; control systems was clearly established. The department was poor&#151;there was only one copy of the standard textbook (Woodworth's <span class="italic">Experimental Psychology</span>), for which students queued up on a rota&#151;but there was an air of excitement over these new developments, and a gifted group of staff and colleagues, including Alan Welford, G. C. Grindley, J. T. MacCurdy, R. H. Thouless, and Derek Russell Davis.<br>
<br>Broadbent graduated with a first-class degree in moral science in 1949, and on 23 June that year he married his childhood sweetheart, Margaret Elizabeth 
    (Peg; <i>b</i>. 1924)
  , daughter of Frederick Holden Wright, a proprietor. They had two daughters (one of whom died in a traffic accident in 1979). He remained in Cambridge after his marriage, having secured a post with the Medical Research Council's Applied Psychology Unit (APU) in Cambridge, of which Bartlett was director, studying the effects of noise on performance, for the Royal Navy. Broadbent remained at the APU in Cambridge for the next twenty-five years, during which time he developed his highly influential approach.<br>
<br>It was a natural experimental move for Broadbent to study the effects of noise using &#145;vigilance tasks&#146;, such as radar watching and other repetitive monitoring demands, as these had been a long-standing interest in the unit. Fortunately he was also able to study less boring tasks, such as air traffic control systems, in which listeners characteristically are confronted with a multitude of signals arriving more or less simultaneously, but can react only to a limited subset. This led him to pursue fresh developments in communication engineering and control theory, and he began to formulate models of systems that showed &#145;attentional selection&#146; in the context of information theory. The topic of attention, which had remained fallow for many years, was thus reinstated but in information-theoretic terms. Experimental work led Broadbent into the area of short-term memory, from which emerged a model that postulated a limited capacity for input and storage of information. He proposed a selective filtering device located early in the nervous system, preceded by a temporary buffer store. These and other ideas were put together in his book <span class="italic">Perception and Communication</span>, first published in 1958, which quickly became recognized as a turning point both for him and for the field. In it was planted the germ for a fully flowering growth widely labelled &#145;cognitive psychology&#146;. Information processing analyses cast in &#145;box-and-arrow&#146; flow charts became commonplace over the next thirty-five years.<br>
<br>In the same year as the publication of <span class="italic">Perception and Communication</span>, the directorship of the APU became vacant, and the Medical Research Council displayed courageous judgement in appointing Broadbent to the post at the relatively young age of thirty-two. The appointment came as a relief to him as until then he had held no tenured post. By this time the APU was one of the largest psychology laboratories in Europe, with a well-developed arrangement with the Royal Navy (which also supplied not only equipment but also many of the human subjects for experiments) and with government departments. The period of Broadbent's directorship from 1958 to 1974 was one of consolidation and development, and the pursuit of interactions with a wide range of potential &#145;customers&#146;, helped by two assistant directors, R. Conrad and E. B. Poulton. Broadbent's own burden was greatly eased by his acquiring, for the first time, a graduate assistant, Margaret Hope Pattison Gregory (<i>b</i>. 1929), who was an active and invaluable collaborator for the rest of his career. She was the daughter of the Revd Romney Moncrief Pattison Muir. She and Broadbent married on 11 November 1972, their first marriages both having ended in divorce.<br>
<br>While director of the APU Broadbent devoted a very large amount of time to promoting psychology, appearing regularly on radio and television. He also foresaw the practical relevance of cognitive psychology to the imminent computer age. Despite heavy administrative burdens in the late 1960s he sat on numerous national committees. But the very size of the APU meant that a great deal of political organization was required, especially when outstations were opened in Oxford, Sussex, and another location in Cambridge. Broadbent was increasingly weighed down&#151;perhaps even marginalized&#151;in the organization he had so successfully shaped and nourished. As he ruefully remarked, his colleagues began to apologize when they asked to discuss a scientific point with him, but never apologized if they wanted to raise an administrative matter. &#145;They saw administration as my job now, on which I <i>ought</i> to spend time.&#146; In 1971 he gave the Medical Research Council three years' notice of his intention to resign, and in 1974 he moved to the Oxford department of experimental psychology as a member of external MRC staff.<br>
<br>In Oxford the Broadbents gathered around them an active and varied team of research students and post-doctoral collaborators, pursued further developments on the relationship between attention and memory, and initiated new lines of work, such as on the effects of stress and anxiety on the health of industrial workers (in which Broadbent collaborated with psychiatric colleagues), and on implicit learning in complex situations. Despite his reluctance to pursue a university career (he spoke with a touch of pride of the fact that he had never held a university post), he devoted himself to academic and university life with energy and aplomb. He was, in many ways, a more active and donnish member of the university than many of its own appointees. He accepted a fellowship at Wolfson College (he had been a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, from 1965 to 1974), chaired the faculty board, sat on many committees, helped with the university campaign, and gave numerous seminars. He also sat on several national committees, and fostered collaborative research links with groups in Germany and Belgium.<br>
<br>Broadbent injected a &#145;paradigm shift&#146; into both academic and applied psychology, which continued to permeate wide reaches of both domains. His own breadth of interest was such that he excluded absolutely nothing as a proper subject for study, provided that it was soundly based on empirical observation. He gave encouragement from his prestigious position to groups and areas of research from which others shied away, such as personality research, aptitude assessment, and the study of mood and emotional assessment. He was a perspicacious role model. Paradoxically, although he was adamant about his credentials and commitment to applied psychology, his own contribution may well be considered that of a theoretician, or at least a paradigm maker, a provider of a general theoretical framework, and a brilliant analyst and synthesizer.<br>
<br>Personally Broadbent appeared as something of a contrast with the all-embracing nature of his intellectual interests. He was a very private person, inscrutable in his personal interactions with colleagues. He once told a former colleague at the APU that he wished he could engage in small talk, but did not know how. He had a puritanical streak, acknowledged and attributed by him to the rigours of his Welsh childhood, which made his judgement on ethical issues invaluable, sound, and trusted. Many were puzzled by his commitment to camping holidays even at a very mature age. He is said to have eschewed the use of taxis if there was any possibility of using public transport, even on arrival after a long transatlantic flight. He continued his solitary walks, especially in the Welsh hills&#151;where, fittingly, his ashes were ultimately scattered. His seriousness about moral matters no doubt made it more painful for him when he was led to renounce his Christian faith, deeply and strongly held well into middle age, after the death of his daughter as an innocent victim of a road accident in October 1979. One feature of his personality universally commented upon by students and colleagues was his generosity. He was never too busy to speak, listen, or write to people, absorbing each topic or problem and then devoting himself to a full and serious answer. He rarely, if ever, put anyone down&#151;at most he would produce only a quizzical expression or a muted chuckle.<br>
<br>Broadbent was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Science in 1971. He was appointed CBE in 1974. He received nine honorary doctorates. He died suddenly and unexpectedly of heart failure at his daughter's home, 31 Narbeth Drive, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on 10 April 1993. He was survived by her and by his second wife, Margaret. He was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 20 April 1993.<br>
