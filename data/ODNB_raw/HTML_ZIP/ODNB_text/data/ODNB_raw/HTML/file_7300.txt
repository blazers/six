<span class="headword">Davison,  Francis</span>  (1573/4&#150;1613<span class="mult">x</span>19), <span class="occ">poet and anthologist</span>, was the eldest, or eldest surviving, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7306/', "William Davison (d. 1608)")</script>, secretary of state, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Francis Spelman (who was the nephew of Sir John Spelman (1495?&#150;1544)) and his wife, Mary, and cousin of the earl of Leicester. He matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1586. He was a clever young man: in 1589 his cousin George Cranmer wrote him a formal Latin letter congratulating him on his learning. In 1593 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and over the winter of 1594&#150;5 he took part in the revels which culminated in the performance before the queen of the &#145;Masque of Proteus&#146;, which he wrote. It was well received, and was in one very important respect innovative: being performed on a stage, it was &#145;the first English masque to conceive, in however small a way, of the masquing hall as a theater&#146;  (S. Orgel, <span class="italic">The Jonsonian Masque</span>, 1965, 9), thus anticipating the masque designs of Inigo Jones.<br>
<br>In May 1595 Davison and his tutor Edward Smyth were given a licence to travel in Europe, procured by the earl of Essex, who gave him 400 crowns towards his expenses, and presumably hoped to use him to gather information. The tour was not a success. Davison and Smyth lived expensively and ran into debt: by the beginning of 1596 Smyth was asking William Davison to extend the allowance he was making them, commenting that Francis could not eat inexpensive food. Although in 1596 Davison sent a treatise on the state of Saxony to Anthony Bacon, who commended it and forwarded it to Essex, a proposed sequel on the state of Tuscany never materialized. He quarrelled with Essex's agent in Venice, and with Smyth. In May 1597 he entered his name to study law at the University of Padua, but by summer 1598 he was back in England, quarrelling more seriously: in or shortly before mid-July he killed one Richard Thornell in a duel. In 1600 he received a pardon from the branding which was the usual penalty for manslaughter.<br>
<br>By that year Davison was nearly thirty. His father was neither rich nor influential. Essex's patronage had not extended far, and was not to be relied on. Davison needed an income. He looked elsewhere for patronage, beginning a treatise on the annulled first marriage of the earl of Bath which was designed to ingratiate him with the Russell family (the countess of Bath was a Russell), and appearing as one of the secretaries whom Sir Thomas Parry engaged in the first half of 1602. The treatise, however, remained unfinished, and the secretaryship lasted only a couple of months.<br>
<br>Davison's next move was to publish a collection of poetry. It is for this, <span class="italic">A Poetical Rapsody</span> (1602), that he is remembered. It is the last of the series of printed poetry collections which begins with <span class="italic">Tottel's Miscellany</span> in 1557. It is made up from groups of poems by Francis Davison himself, his brother Walter, and an anonymous third writer or group of writers, to which a few poems by Philip Sidney, the countess of Pembroke, Edmund Spenser, and others are added at the beginning and end of the volume. Davison claimed, perhaps disingenuously, that these additions were the printer's responsibility. They certainly accord with his invocations of Sidney in his dedicatory sonnet to the earl of Pembroke and elsewhere, and with the nostalgic, backward-looking quality of the collection, with its Spenserian pastorals and experiments in quantitative metre, as a whole. Some of Davison's contributions are highly conventional; but they also include sharp political commentary, such as a poem in which the lamentations of a grave shepherd called Eubulus who has been harshly treated by his mistress Astraea dramatize the fall from favour of William Davison, and another in praise of the recently executed earl of Essex.<br>
<br>After <span class="italic">A Poetical Rapsody</span> Davison continued to write, publishing a broadsheet of Latin anagrams on the names of various noblemen, beginning a translation of the psalms, and planning a &#145;Relation of England&#146;. He owned a manuscript of Donne's satires, and attempted to obtain more poetry by Donne and others in manuscript, perhaps with a second anthology in mind. He added material to the second edition of the <span class="italic">Rapsody</span> in 1608, but does not seem to have had any connection with the third in 1611. The last work of his which can be dated is a racy poem called &#145;The Counterskuffle&#146;, about a fight in a debtors' prison in February 1613, which claims to be based on firsthand observation. Another poem, the epigram &#145;On Painted Ladys&#146;, whose main point is a pun on fucus (the name of a cosmetic) and &#145;fuck us&#146;, is dated 1615 in a commonplace book, but may have been written earlier.<br>
<br>The antiquary Ralph Starkey possessed a number of Francis Davison's manuscripts as well as the state papers of William Davison which were confiscated from him in 1619. All these manuscripts presumably came to him as a single collection, probably after Francis's death, which can therefore be dated between 1613 and 1619.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_7305"></a><span class="headword">Walter Davison</span>  (1581?&#150;1602<span class="mult">x</span>8)<span class="occ"></span>, Francis's younger brother, wrote eighteen of the poems printed in the first edition of <span class="italic">A Poetical Rapsody</span> when he was in his late teens. Seventeen of these comprise a competent but unmemorable sequence of amatory poems; the last is a translation from the Latin of a misogynistic epigram. In 1602 Francis described him as a professional soldier, then serving in the Low Countries; since he is not mentioned in the will of his father in 1608, he had presumably died before then.<br>
