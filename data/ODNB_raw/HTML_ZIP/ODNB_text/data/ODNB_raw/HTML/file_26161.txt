<span class="headword">Spooner,  Charles</span>  (1806&#150;1871), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon</span>, born on 19 October 1806, was the youngest of the three sons of John Spooner of Fordham, Essex. His father at the time of his birth occupied the dairy farm at Mistley Park, near Manningtree, Essex. On leaving school Charles Spooner was apprenticed to a chemist, George Jervis of Westbar, Sheffield, and at the end of his apprenticeship he entered the Royal Veterinary College, London, as a student, in November 1828. He obtained his diploma on 21 July 1829, and shortly afterwards was appointed veterinary surgeon to the Zoological Society, chiefly through the influence of Professor William Sewell (1780&#150;1853).<br>
<br>Spooner's appointment extended his knowledge of anatomy and physiology and increased his perception of the inadequacies of the course taught, at that time, at the Royal Veterinary College. While working in his capacity as veterinary surgeon to the Zoological Society, he established a school of veterinary anatomy in a house opposite the college, where he gave private lectures and demonstrations to college students. <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span> reports that Spooner was already &#145;well known as one of the best veterinary anatomists, perhaps the best, of which the profession could boast&#146;  (<span class="italic">Veterinarian</span>, 8.646), and thus a gap which had long existed in the official college training was efficiently filled. Spooner was associated with Sewell in the formation, in 1836, of the Veterinary Medical Association, of which he became treasurer and in 1839 president, an office to which he was subsequently re-elected annually. Spooner's post at the Zoological Society was eventually taken over by William Youatt.<br>
<br>Early in 1839 Spooner reluctantly accepted the post of demonstrator of anatomy at the Royal Veterinary College, and terminated his private classes. His advancement at the college was rapid. In the same year he became assistant professor in the place of Sewell, who was now made professor of the college on the death of the former chief, Professor Edward Coleman (1764&#150;1839). Spooner delivered his first lecture on 19 November 1839. On 9 January 1840 he was elected by the medical committee of the college to become an examiner of the college students. On 22 July the same year he married Mary Anne, daughter of William Boulton. They subsequently had eight children&#151;five sons and three daughters. In 1842 he became deputy professor of the college, and during the 1843&#150;4 session the students presented him with a marble bust of himself in recognition of his teaching abilities. In 1853, on the death of Sewell, Spooner became chief professor and secretary, with residence in the college. He now stood at the head of his profession, and in 1858 he became president of the incorporated Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, of which he had been an original petitioner in 1844.<br>
<br>In 1865 Spooner was a member of the cattle plague commission. His judgement as a witness had by then been frequently appealed to in the law courts in cases of veterinary jurisprudence. He was held in extremely high regard both by his students and by many of his contemporaries within the emerging veterinary profession, and <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, reporting on his abilities as a legal witness, claimed &#145;his testimony and opinion were highly valued by judge, jury and client&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 869). In 1864, as a tribute to his administrative abilities, a special meeting of the governors of the Royal Veterinary College recorded in the minute book &#145;that at no time since the foundation of the college has the average number of students in the theatre, or patients in the infirmary, been so large &hellip; nor the resources of the college so prosperous as at the present time &hellip; since it came under his [Spooner's] superintendence&#146;  (minute books, RVC). However, though for some time joint editor of the <span class="italic">Veterinary Review</span>, Spooner wrote little. It was rather as a surgeon, where he was aided by his accurate knowledge of anatomy, as a lecturer, and as a demonstrator on anatomy, that his talent was shown. Numerous reports of his speeches and lectures may be found in <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, and in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Veterinary Medical Association</span>. Spooner was considered the chief authority on horse matters in Britain and a lecture by him entitled &#145;Horses&#146;, delivered before the members of the Farringdon Agricultural Library, was published as the pamphlet <span class="italic">Horses and Sheep</span> (1861).<br>
<br>Spooner died in the Royal Veterinary College on 24 November 1871 and was buried in Highgate cemetery five days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
