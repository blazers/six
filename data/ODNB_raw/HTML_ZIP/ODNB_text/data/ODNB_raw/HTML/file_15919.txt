<span class="headword">Lamb, Sir  Matthew</span>, first baronet  (1705?&#150;1768), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, was probably born in 1705, the second son of Matthew Lamb (<i>d</i>. 1735), an attorney of Southwell in Nottinghamshire and land agent to the Coke family of Melbourne, Derbyshire. His elder brother Robert (1702&#150;1769) became dean of Peterborough in 1744 and bishop of Peterborough in 1764. It is likely that Matthew Lamb also had a sister for, in August 1738, a Miss Lamb, &#145;<i>Sister</i> of &#151; Lamb of <i>Lincoln</i>'s-Inn, Esq.&#146; was married to Richard Middlemore  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 435).<br>
<br>Lamb was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 January 1726 and called to the bar on 26 April 1733, having received his legal training from his uncle Peniston Lamb who was a successful pleader &#145;under the bar&#146;, that is, a conveyancing lawyer holding a position between that of an attorney and counsel. It was said of Peniston Lamb, who had himself been admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1708, that he was skilled in &#145;pleading and demurring, weaving settlements and ravelling threads of adverse wills&#146;  (Torrens, 11). When Lamb's uncle died on 29 January 1735 he left him a fortune estimated at &pound;100,000 as well as his chambers in Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>Through his uncle, the executor of the will and guardian of the children of John, second Earl Fitzwilliam, Lamb became land agent, legal adviser, and moneylender to many members of the aristocracy. The sums he lent were considerable. This is demonstrated by Sarah, first duchess of Marlborough's complaining that she and Lord Godolphin were not receiving their jointures because the third duke was paying interest to Lamb at the rate of no less than &pound;9000 a year out of the trust estate  (Rowse, 53). Lamb managed the financial affairs of Lord Holdernesse from 1739 to 1768 and in the latter year made him a loan of &pound;6000 secured by a bond  (BL, Egerton MS 3497, fols. 1&#150;76, 121). He was also legal adviser to Lord Salisbury and Lord Egmont, and enriched himself at their expense. By way of explaining to a visitor to Brocket Hall how a right of fishing through part of the property, almost up to the park, belonged to Lord Salisbury, his grandson the second Viscount Melbourne said: &#145;Well, I believe that my grandfather did the Salisburys out of some land in that direction, and was generous enough to leave them the fishing&#146;  (Hayward, 332).<br>
<br>The intimate knowledge which Lamb possessed of the affairs of the aristocracy gave him an influence which he well knew how to wield, and upon whom. Therefore, when Robert Lamb was nominated to the see of Peterborough in 1764 he almost certainly owed that preferment to his younger brother's pressing his claims to the bishopric upon the duke of Newcastle. Lamb was appointed solicitor to the revenue of the Post Office in 1738. He also held the office of counsel to the Board of Trade and Plantations. However, a proposal in 1746 to appoint him king's counsel met with opposition from the legal profession because &#145;he never was an hour in Westminster Hall as a counsel in his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Polwarth MSS</span>, 5.186). In August 1756 Lamb was appointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> for the liberty of Peterborough in the county of Northampton, gaining power thereby over appointments to the magistracy. Despite the earlier opposition to his appointment as king's counsel, he finally attained that dignity in 1754.<br>
<br>Lamb was returned to parliament for the constituency of Stockbridge in 1741, and in 1747 was elected to Peterborough, a seat which he managed in the Fitzwilliam interest until his death. He was created a baronet on 17 January 1755, perhaps through the intercession of the duke of Newcastle. About 1740 Lamb married Charlotte, daughter of the Right Honourable Thomas Coke, a privy councillor and vice-chamberlain to Queen Anne, and sister and heiress of George Lewis Coke. Through his marriage he acquired Melbourne Hall as a residence on George Coke's unexpected death in 1751. He had already acquired Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, by purchase from the representatives of Sir Thomas Winnington in 1746. Lamb and his wife had three children: Peniston (1745&#150;1828), who succeeded to the baronetcy, and was created Lord (1770) and Viscount (1781) Melbourne in the Irish peerage and Lord Melbourne in the English peerage (1815); Charlotte, who married Henry, second Earl Fauconberg in 1766, and died in 1790; and Anne, who died unmarried in 1768. Lamb's grandson was William Lamb, second Viscount Melbourne (1779&#150;1848).<br>
<br>In 1756 Lamb moved from Red Lion Square, London, an area inhabited by judges and senior counsel, to the more fashionable Sackville Street in Piccadilly. Before moving to Sackville Street he entered into abortive negotiations in 1754 with Lord Strafford for the purchase of a house in Albemarle Street which had been occupied by the late Lady Strafford. He died after a short illness on 5 November 1768 and was buried at Bishop's Hatfield, Hertfordshire. His will was proved in November 1768 when his property, half of which was in personalty, was valued at nearly &pound;1 million.<br>
