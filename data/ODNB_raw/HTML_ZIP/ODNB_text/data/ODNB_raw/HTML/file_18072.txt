<span class="headword">Markland,  Abraham</span>  (1645&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 25 June 1645 in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, London, the third surviving son of Michael Markland (<i>d</i>. 1663), apothecary, and his second wife, Anne Perry (<i>d</i>. 1662). He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1658 and elected to a scholarship at St John's College, Oxford, on 14 July 1662. He graduated BA in 1666, became a fellow of the college, and proceeded MA in 1669. While at Oxford he composed his <span class="italic">Poems on his majesties birth and restoration; his highness Prince Rupert's and his grace the duke of Albemarle's naval victories; the late great pestilence and fire of London</span> (1667). In 1692 he was admitted to the degrees of bachelor and doctor of divinity at Oxford.<br>
<br>Markland was ordained into the diocese of Winchester on 2 June 1672 and was appointed rector of Brixton on the Isle of Wight in 1674; he was instituted rector of Easton, Hampshire, in 1677, of Houghton (1678), and of Meonstoke (1684). In July 1679 he was installed as a canon of Winchester Cathedral. In October 1682, with the government of the City of London firmly under tory control, Markland preached a fervently loyalist sermon before the court of aldermen in which he compared London, fallen into degeneracy and contempt for its governors and riven by whig and nonconformist factionalism, directly and unfavourably with the Jerusalem that Christ had wept over. He rejoiced that the City had been miraculously delivered from the hands of those who were resolutely impenitent for the death of Charles I, men who were &#145;no more concern'd on the Thirtieth of January, than the Jews are on Good-Friday&#146; and who would have treated Charles II the same way as they had his father  (A. Markland, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Court of Aldermen &hellip; Octob. 29 1682</span>, 1683, 27). Markland married Catherine Pitt (<i>c</i>.1637&#150;1693), daughter of Edward Pitt and Rachel Morton of Stratfield Saye; their son, George, was born on 18 November 1678, and they also had a daughter, Jane. With his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1734), he had a son, Abraham (<i>d</i>. 1705), who died in infancy, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Anne.<br>
<br>In August 1694 Markland was appointed a master of the hospital of St Cross in Winchester. During his tenure it was alleged that the hospital records had been destroyed and so a new custumal was drawn up and approved by the bishop in 1696. These statutes made the master the recipient of all hospital revenue but he was to finance the provisions made for the thirteen brethren and for the maintenance of the hospital. The brethren were to take oaths of obedience to the master; they were to bequeath all personal possessions to the master and were to be subject to his discipline. This custumal resulted in a legal challenge in the nineteenth century when it was castigated as &#145;a willfull breach of trust&#146;; the controversy over St Cross was one of the cases which inspired Anthony Trollope's <span class="italic">The Warden</span> (1855). Markland died on 29 July 1728 and a memorial to him (as well as his wife and sons George and Abraham) was erected in the choir of St Cross, Winchester. A collection of his sermons preached at Winchester Cathedral was published in 1729.<br>
