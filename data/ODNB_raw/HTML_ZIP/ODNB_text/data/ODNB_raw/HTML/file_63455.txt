</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mair,  Lucy Philip</span>  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">social anthropologist</span>, was born on 28 January 1901 at Banstead, Surrey, the eldest of four children of David Beveridge Mair (1868&#150;1942) and his wife, Jessy (later Janet) Thomson Philip (1876&#150;1959). Her father was a former mathematics fellow at Christ's College, Cambridge, who had moved on marriage to the civil service commission. Her mother was the daughter of a successful and educated Dundee builder. Lucy Mair referred in later life to her &#145;awful&#146; family  (La Fontaine, interview, 1983): her father was taciturn, her mother dominating and fond of society. From 1906 William Beveridge was a constant visitor to his cousin's house, and lived as a neighbour when in 1913 the Mairs moved to Campden Hill Gardens, Kensington. In 1914 David Mair became an Admiralty cryptographer and was responsible for breaking the coded messages that led to the arrest of Sir Roger Casement. Jessy joined William Beveridge in the Ministry of Munitions, moving with him to the Ministry of Food (where she rose to become director of bacon) and, after the war, to the London School of Economics where she became secretary and Beveridge became director. In 1933 David Mair retired from the civil service commission and thereafter hardly ever lived at home except for occasional visits. He died on 21 July 1942; six months later Jessy and William married.<br>
<br>William Beveridge had befriended Lucy and her sister Marjory: he took them rock-climbing, and went on a walking tour with Lucy. When Lucy was introduced to music by Gustav Holst, then teaching at St Paul's Girls' School, William gave her a silver flute. (A. A. Uthwatt, also a family friend, had given her a wooden one shortly before.) People gossiped about the Mairs' domestic arrangements, and about William's intimacy within the family, but relations were not conventionally immoral. William was clearly taken aback by the suggestion of one of the daughters on the day of David's funeral that he should marry Jessy; and it is unlikely that Beveridge had a physical relationship with Lucy's mother even after their marriage.<br>
<br>Lucy Mair was educated at St Paul's Girls' School in London, and then at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read the classical tripos, graduating in 1922. She was employed for five years by Gilbert Murray as his secretary-assistant in League of Nations affairs. In 1927 she joined her mother and future stepfather at the London School of Economics, holding a lecturership in international relations. The school has no record of any discussion about the propriety of that appointment. Audrey Richards introduced Mair to B. Malinowski's seminar in anthropology because her work (on mandated territories) involved Africa, and Richards thought that no one could understand Africa unless they understood anthropology. Mair impressed the ebullient Malinowski, but she probably never succumbed to his undoubted charm. She remained a sceptical admirer, with deep reservations about his ideas, throughout her life. He nevertheless arranged for her to go to Buganda to do fieldwork, with a Rockefeller grant. Mair later thought that he had wished to protect her from the influence of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown who was to teach at the school while Malinowski was on leave. She spent nine months in Buganda, fieldwork that resulted in her first anthropological work, <span class="italic">An African People in the Twentieth Century</span> (1934). Returning to the London School of Economics in the early 1930s, she was a member of the group that included E. E. Evans-Pritchard, R. Firth, M. Fortes, M. Gluckman, A. Richards, and I. Schapera, as well as S. F. Nadel and, later, Edmund Leach. It was a stimulating though not always harmonious group, some of the members later dominating British social anthropology, and profoundly influential in America.<br>
<br>Mair continued to teach, taking responsibility for the courses intended to train colonial administrators; the students, at first mostly former members of the British army, later included talented young local nationals from the colonies themselves. Funding was eventually removed: the local students were to go to residential universities where they were thought to be less exposed to radical ideas. Mair also had a reputation, not justified, for believing that Africans were always right, and for being fierce, which may be: until the end of her life she was formidable in conversation, her vehement cleverness sometimes amplified by social awkwardness.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Mair served in the Royal Institute for International Affairs and at the Foreign Office. On her return to the London School of Economics she was seconded to Canberra to teach members of the Australian military administration of Papua New Guinea. She had two spells there, and wrote <span class="italic">Australia in New Guinea</span> (1948), with an updated version a few years later. In 1947 she was promoted reader in colonial administration, changing the title to applied anthropology in 1955. She influenced a wide range of pupils at the school, from the young men in the colonial administrators' course to her BA and PhD students in social anthropology from the 1950s. She became professor in 1963, and taught at the universities of Durham and Kent after her retirement in 1968.<br>
<br>Mair's early publications (many collected in <span class="italic">Studies in Applied Anthropology</span>, published in 1957, and <span class="italic">Anthropology and Social Change</span> which appeared in 1969) were concerned with the technical problems of colonial administration and with explaining the aims and achievements of anthropologists to an audience of administrators. <span class="italic">New Nations</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The New Africa</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">Anthropology and Development</span> (1984) summarized and consolidated that work, making it accessible to students and administrators. In the post-war years she began a series of short volumes based on her lectures: <span class="italic">Primitive Government</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Witchcraft</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Marriage</span> (1971). In 1972 she published her <span class="italic">Introduction to Social Anthropology</span> which was still in print twenty-five years later. She was scornful of colleagues who would only write specialist work for an audience of their own kind, and these last four books, concise and expository accounts of the state of knowledge, brought her a much wider readership. They were often innovatory&#151;<span class="italic">Primitive Government</span>, for instance, in its treatment of patronage&#151;but she did not trumpet her resolution of theoretical issues. Her analysis of social organization was centred on individuals who made choices constrained by structures of opportunities and of rules of conduct: she argued, for example, that rural Africans who migrated to cities had more &#145;room for manoeuvre&#146;  (L. Mair, <span class="italic">Studies in Applied Anthropology</span>, 1957) to arrange their lives. She asked the British how they themselves would choose between good government and self-government, and then why they thought Africans should choose differently. She said she had ceased in the 1920s to imagine that socialism could make the world pleasant for everyone. In teaching the anthropology of economic and social development she said that development was not a separate discipline that could take the findings of anthropology and apply them: it was essential to know the social organization of developing peoples, to be able to assess the likely consequences of intervention.<br>
<br>In the 1960s and 1970s Mair was confronted by socialist and <i>marxisant</i> anthropologists who disparaged colleagues who had worked in colonies. She refused to admit that everything colonial administrators had done was completely wrong, and she insisted that they had thought they were doing good. Hers was an ironical anthropology&#151;she compared people's intentions and choices with the outcome of their actions, and deployed as much compassion as the circumstances might allow. This proceeded from her conviction that fairness, social justice, had to be achieved and maintained first by careful scholarship and then by hard work. And this in turn derived from her early life. On her arrival at Newnham College in 1919 she had found women under intense pressure to prove themselves as good as men: the pursuit of anything other than excellence was a betrayal. But when she looked beyond her immediate family she found a world devastated of men, by men. Indeed, like many formidably clever women of her age, she never married; and her chapter in <span class="italic">Marriage</span> entitled &#145;What are husbands for?&#146; suggests that she was still preoccupied with the contradictions, not to say absurdities, of women's assumption that men were superior beings, to be emulated.<br>
<br>Mair died in hospital at Blackheath, London, on 1 April 1986, of emphysema. She bequeathed her books to libraries at the London School of Economics, and made various other bequests. The bulk of her estate went to her sister Marjory's children, John and Lucy.<br>
