<span class="headword">Bowman, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1816&#150;1892), <span class="occ">ophthalmic surgeon and anatomist</span>, was born at Sweetbriar Hall, Hospital Street, Nantwich, Cheshire, on 20 July 1816, the third of the four sons (there was one daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3079/', "John Eddowes Bowman the elder (1785&#150;1841)")</script>, a banker as well as botanist and fellow of the Linnean Society, and his wife and cousin, Elizabeth (1788&#150;1859), daughter of William Eddowes, a bookseller of Shrewsbury. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3076/', "Eddowes Bowman")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3078/', "Henry Bowman")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3079/', "Bowman, John Eddowes, the elder")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3080/', "John Eddowes Bowman (1819&#150;1856)")</script>. At the age of ten he was sent to Hazelwood School, near Birmingham, run by Thomas Wright Hill, father of Sir Rowland Hill. This was a progressive school that had abolished corporal punishment and was regulated by rules drawn up and enforced by the students themselves. At about the age of sixteen Bowman was apprenticed to W. A. Betts of the Birmingham Infirmary, and worked under Joseph Hodgson, later founder of the Birmingham Eye Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1837 Bowman went to London and joined the medical department of King's College, University of London. In the following year he visited seventeen hospitals in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and France, travelling with Francis Galton, who had been a fellow pupil under Hodgson. Galton's account of their journey is entertainingly told in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of my Life</span> (1908). When King's College Hospital was founded in 1839, Bowman was elected to the staff as assistant surgeon, and in the same year he was also appointed junior demonstrator of anatomy and curator of the museum at King's College, working closely with Richard Partridge, the professor of anatomy. On 28 December 1842 Bowman married Harriet Paget (<i>d</i>. 1900), fifth daughter of Thomas Paget, a surgeon of Leicester. They had seven children.<br>
<br>In 1846 Bowman was appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, becoming full surgeon in 1851; he remained there until mandatory retirement at the age of sixty in 1876. Elected joint professor of physiology and general anatomy (with Robert Bentley Todd) at King's College in 1848, he became an honorary fellow in 1855 and a member of the council in 1879. He became full surgeon to King's College Hospital in 1856, and though the claims of private practice (necessitated by his growing family) compelled him to resign this office in 1862, he maintained his interest in the institution until he died. He continued in private practice until the age of seventy and participated in scientific meetings for several years after that.<br>
<br>Bowman was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1841, at the unusually early age of twenty-five, and subsequently served on the council and as one of the vice-presidents. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1844. In 1867 the degree of MD <i>honoris causa</i> was granted him by the University of Dublin, and in 1880 the University of Cambridge awarded him the degree of LLD. In 1884 he was made a baronet.<br>
<br>Bowman became the leading ophthalmic surgeon in London after the death of John Dalrymple in 1852. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, held at the Crystal Palace in London, Bowman met Albrecht von Graefe and Frans Cornelius Donders, and their enthusiastic exchange of ideas regarding ophthalmology and their lasting friendship were a great influence on his professional life. Bowman was among the first in England to become expert in the use of the ophthalmoscope. In 1857 he employed and advocated strongly von Graefe's treatment of glaucoma by iridectomy, and he was busy during the years 1864 and 1865 with new methods of treating cases of detached retina and cataract.<br>
<br>In 1880 Bowman was elected the first president of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom, having played a large role in its founding. During the three years that he held this post, he liberally supported the society through money for its library. A few years later the society established an annual Bowman lecture in his honour; and when in 1965 the society decided to acquire armorial bearings, the arms embodied references to Bowman, including the bowman at the crest. In 1888 the Bowman Testimonial Fund commissioned his portrait to be painted by Walter William Ouless; it was subsequently exhibited in the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Bowman took a considerable interest in nursing, a concern apparently stimulated by his friendship with Florence Nightingale, whose first nursing post was at the Harley Street Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness, where Bowman was a surgeon. They remained friends, and some of their correspondence has been preserved. In conjunction with Robert Bentley Todd and others, Bowman established the St John's House and Sisterhood, an institution which provided trained nurses for the sick and poor, and a few years later he was able to aid Florence Nightingale by sending out trained nurses to the East during the Crimean War.<br>
<br>Bowman's work divides itself sharply into two periods: one of pure anatomical research, the other concerned with the practice of ophthalmic surgery. His anatomical and physiological investigations were chiefly carried out in the years 1839&#150;42. Many of them were prepared as entries for Robert Bentley Todd's illustrated <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</span> (5 vols., 1836&#150;59) and read before various meetings of the Royal Society. Muscle tissue was the first structure he minutely examined with his microscope, and this work was followed by a histological study of the kidney, for which he was awarded the Royal Society's medal in 1842. He also collaborated with Todd in producing <span class="italic">The Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man</span> (2 vols., 1843&#150;56). Both works contain numerous illustrations by Bowman himself, who combined accomplished artistic skills with mastery of the microscope. While preparing entries for these two publications, Bowman discovered many new anatomical structures, at least six of which still bear his name, such as the <i>capsula glomeruli</i>, still called &#145;Bowman's capsule&#146;. In 1847 he presented an important paper on the mechanism of accommodation to a meeting in Oxford of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at which he demonstrated simultaneously with, but independently of, Ernst Willhelm Brueke (1819&#150;1892) the structure and function of the ciliary muscle. After 1850 Bowman's attention turned solely to ophthalmic surgery.<br>
<br>Bowman died of pneumonia at his large country house, Joldwynds, between Dorking and Guildford, Surrey, on 29 March 1892, and was buried on 1 April in the neighbouring churchyard of Holmbury St Mary. To his widow he bequeathed his country estate of Joldwynds, his London residence (since 1850) at 5 Clifford Street, parish of St James, and other properties in London, as well as an estate valued at over &pound;100,000. Bowman had been close friends with the artist George Frederic Watts, and possessed several paintings by Watts, including his own portrait painted in 1865, Watts's portraits of Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Donders, and Watts's self-portrait (the latter now in the Tate collection). Bowman's widow commissioned John Cother Webb to make an engraving of his portrait by W. W. Ouless, copies of which she then distributed to all subscribers to his collected ophthalmological works, which were assembled by friends and published in two volumes in 1892.<br>
<br>Bowman made fundamental contributions to histology and to the knowledge of the structure of the eye, the kidney and striated muscle, and of other structures. These achievements are the more remarkable when it is recalled that he employed relatively simple techniques and that no highly accurate microtome or staining techniques were then available. Bowman profoundly influenced anatomical thinking and teaching by constantly relating minutely described anatomical structures to their physiological functions. Through his skills as an anatomist and microscopist he set a model for future research in physiology and histology.<br>
<br>As an ophthalmic surgeon Bowman maintained a constant interest in new techniques and new technologies, and he modified or developed a number of surgical procedures, including the treatment of lacrimal obstruction, antiglaucoma iridectomy, and the removal of soft cataracts by a suction instrument (which he performed under chloroform anaesthesia). Well known for his manual dexterity, a remarkably light touch, and excellent operative skills, he developed a large private practice in addition to the patients he attended as part of his duties at Moorfields. As a conscientious committee member and organizer, he was noted for his powers of persuasion. A handsome and slender man, who rarely drank, never smoked, and was abstemious in eating, he exemplified certain Victorian virtues through his dignity and reserve, his early rising and constant hard work, and his religious piety (of a dissenting nature). Bowman did not write a book of his own, but through his twenty-three papers and his entries in anatomical encyclopaedias, he became one of the most important English figures of the nineteenth century in the fields of anatomy, histology, and ophthalmic surgery.<br>
