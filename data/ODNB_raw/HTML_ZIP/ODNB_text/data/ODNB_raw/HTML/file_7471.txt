<span class="headword">Morgan,  Campbell Greig  De</span>  (1811&#150;1876), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Clovelly, near Bideford, Devon, the youngest of the three sons of Colonel John De Morgan (1772&#150;1816) of the Indian army, and his wife Elizabeth (1776&#150;1856), the daughter of John Dodson and granddaughter of James Dodson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7470/', "Augustus De Morgan")</script>, the mathematician, was his elder brother. He was educated at University College, London, and afterwards at the Middlesex Hospital. In 1835 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and in 1841 he was lecturer on forensic medicine at the Middlesex Hospital. In 1842 he became assistant surgeon there and he held the chair of anatomy in 1845. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843 and then full surgeon at the Middlesex on the retirement of Mr Tuson in 1854.<br>
<br>With John Tomes, De Morgan contributed a paper to the Royal Society on the development of bone, which gained him election as FRS and which was printed in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1852. He wrote the article &#145;Erysipelas&#146; in Holmes's <span class="italic">System of Surgery</span> (1860) and in 1865 he joined the Pathological Society and began contributing papers to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In 1872 he published a work entitled <span class="italic">Origin of Cancer</span>, following a series of papers on that subject published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1871. This was a subject which he had studied during thirty-four years in the special cancer wards of the Middlesex Hospital.<br>
<br>De Morgan continued his teaching career, lecturing on anatomy, physiology, and forensic medicine, and on the retirement of Mr Shaw he became sole lecturer on surgery at the Middlesex. He worked as a consulting surgeon to the London Fever Hospital and to the East Grinstead Dispensary, and he was also a surgeon at the Institution for Invalid Gentlewomen.<br>
<br>In addition to his professional attainments De Morgan was said to be an accomplished musician and a gifted caricaturist. He was described as a man who, under a somewhat cold manner, had great kindness and warmth of heart, and his contemporaries knew him as a modest and generous man of deep religious convictions. His last act was one of devoted attention to his old friend J. G. Lough, the sculptor; after sitting up with him through the night, he returned home to 29 Seymour Street, Portman Square, London, in the cold of an early morning and caught a fatal chill. He died at home on 12 April 1876 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, on 18 April. His wife (formerly Miss Hobson) had died in 1856.<br>
