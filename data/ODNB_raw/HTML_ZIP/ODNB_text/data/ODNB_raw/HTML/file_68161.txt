<span class="headword">Estaugh <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Haddon]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1680&#150;1762), <span class="occ">Quaker leader and colonial landowner</span>, was born on 5 July 1680 in Bermondsey, Surrey, the second daughter and third child of John Haddon (1654&#150;1724) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (1651?&#150;1724). John Haddon was a convinced Quaker and twice had been fined for voicing his religious views. Like other Quakers he was persuaded by William Penn to look to America for sanctuary. In 1701 he purchased hundreds of acres of land in West Jersey across from Philadelphia. At the time that he signed a land settlement agreement Haddon was a blacksmith in London and unable to accept business offers, which required the taking of oaths of allegiance. The situation changed with the acceptance of affirmations; moreover, Haddon was appointed officer for the Pennsylvania Land Company as well as for the London Lead Company. The latter position made him reluctant to occupy his new property, and indeed he never left England.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Haddon, only nineteen at the time, &#145;felt a drawing&#146; to fulfil her father's land settlement and was given full power of attorney to transact business in West Jersey. Before she arrived in 1701 her father had already had a dwelling built for her at Cooper's Creek, Newtown township; this now became her home. Elizabeth arrived, thinking that eventually some of her immediate family would follow. This, however, never happened, and with the care of a widowed friend and two faithful manservants she was left to develop what became the large plantation of Haddonfield, an instance &#145;unique in Quaker records&#146;  (Jones, 389).<br>
<br>Auspiciously, Elizabeth Haddon became reacquainted with a Quaker leader John Estaugh (1676&#150;1742), whom she had met at Bermondsey some years earlier and who had arrived in America in 1700 on a religious visit. John and Elizabeth's courtship was celebrated in &#145;Elizabeth&#146;, the only story of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's <span class="italic">Tales of a Wayside Inn</span> (1863) to be set outside his native New England. The couple were married in Quaker fashion at Haddonfield on 1 December 1702. Elizabeth said of their forty-year marriage: &#145;few if any in a married state ever lived in sweeter harmony than we did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Essays of John Woolman</span>, 532). In 1713 work began on New Haddonfield, the couple's second residence, around which the town of Haddonfield was founded. Though Elizabeth and John Estaugh had no children of their own they were joined, in 1723, by Ebenezer Hopkins, Elizabeth's nephew.<br>
<br>Over the years the Estaughs entertained many Quakers, including John Haslam, a Yorkshire preacher of fifty years' standing. Elizabeth formed a special friendship with Elizabeth Woolman, the sister of John Woolman, a leading Quaker author and an anti-slavery pioneer. Elizabeth Estaugh stayed with Elizabeth Woolman during the latter's final illness, and in 1747 witnessed her will. Elizabeth had long taken an interest in the sick and to this day, at Haddonfield, can be seen her old brewhouse, where she made many &#145;simples and remedies&#146; to treat inhabitants of her vast settlement. She remained active in Friends' meetings up to her death; for fifty years she was clerk of the women's monthly meeting and so vast was her correspondence that she had to employ several secretaries.<br>
<br>John Estaugh became an agent in his father-in-law's business in the land company in West Jersey; he also undertook a number of visits in the religious ministry of Friends. During one of these, to the small island of Tortola in the West Indies in 1742, he died. After her husband's death Elizabeth maintained her church work and continued to manage the family's estate. She died on 30 March 1762, on Haddonfield plantation, and was buried in the cemetery of the local Friends' meeting-house. Much of her property subsequently passed to the children of Ebenezer Hopkins.<br>
<br>In the testimony of Haddonfield monthly meeting, after Elizabeth's death, it was written: &#145;Her heart and house were open to her friends, whom to entertain, seemed one of her greatest pleasures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Essays of John Woolman</span>, 532). Today Elizabeth Estaugh, who is also known by her maiden name of Elizabeth Haddon, is recognized as the founder of the town of Haddonfield, New Jersey, which has a population of 15,000, and is remembered by the state as one of its most significant pioneers.<br>
