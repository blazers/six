<span class="headword">Sihtric</span> <span class="st"> [Sigtryggr &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson, Sigtryggr Silkiskegg]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1042), <span class="occ">king of Dublin</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20671/', "&#211;l&#225;f Sihtricson (d. 981)")</script>, sometime king of Dublin and Northumbria, and Gormflaith (<i>d</i>. 1030), daughter of Murchad mac Finn, king of Leinster; his alternative Old Norse name, Sigtryggr Silkiskegg, may be translated as Sihtric Silkenbeard. Sihtric acceded to the kingship of Dublin after the murder of his paternal half-brother Gl&uacute;niairn in 989. In 994 a rival viking leader named &Iacute;varr of Waterford forced him from the city, but he was reinstated by the following year. He was allied with his mother's brother M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda, who was soon to be king of Leinster, when the pair were defeated late in 999 at the battle of Glenn M&aacute;ma (Wicklow) by the future high-king Brian B&oacute;ruma mac Cenn&eacute;tig. Brian captured Dublin on new year's day.<br>
<br>For more than a decade Sihtric was a faithful subordinate, but in 1013 challenges appeared to Brian's lordship, and Sihtric and M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda rose in revolt. A campaign against Dublin by Brian late in the year achieved nothing, so he made plans to return in the spring. Sihtric sought support from the viking settlements round Britain; an account of his mission to Sigurd, earl of Orkney, is found in <span class="italic">Njals saga</span>. At the eventual confrontation, the famous battle of Clontarf fought on Good Friday (23 April) 1014, Sihtric and M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda had in their ranks vikings from Orkney, the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, and northern England, in addition to troops from Leinster and Dublin. On the actual day of battle Sihtric remained aloof and watched the conflict from the walls of Dublin, although his sons and kinsmen fought. Even though Clontarf is considered to have been a victory for Brian, it was a Pyrrhic victory; the high-king was slain, his army sustained heavy losses, and Sihtric remained in control of Dublin.<br>
<br>By this time Dublin was one of the leading ports on the Irish Sea, and Sihtric had to contend with Irish princes who wanted a share of Dublin's riches. A brief glimpse of this wealth can be seen when, in 1029, he had to pay a ransom for his son &Oacute;l&aacute;f, which included 1200 cows, 120 Welsh ponies, 60 ounces of gold, and another 60 ounces of silver. In 1030 Sihtric allied with the king of the English, Cnut, and their fleets raided Wales, after which a Dublin colony was established in Gwynedd. For the following years Sihtric was at the height of his power, defeating neighbouring Irish kingdoms, including an alliance of three at the Boyne in 1032, and executing rivals at Dublin. Sihtric was forced to abdicate, however, in 1036 in favour of Echmarcach R&ouml;gnvaldsson, lord of the Isles. He died in exile, at an unknown place, in 1042.<br>
<br>Sihtric was also a patron of the arts, a benefactor of the church, and an economic innovator. Verses survive that were composed in his honour by the Icelandic poet Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue. He established a bishopric at Dublin in addition to beginning the construction of Christ Church Cathedral, and in 1028 he made a pilgrimage to Rome. In the last decade of the tenth century Sihtric founded a mint at Dublin, the first mint in Ireland. His wife was Sl&aacute;ine, daughter of Brian B&oacute;ruma. Their son &Oacute;l&aacute;f was killed in England in 1034, but &Oacute;l&aacute;f's dynasty ruled in Wales after his grandson Gruffudd ap Cynan took lordship of Gwynedd. Other children of Sihtric were Artalach (<i>d</i>. 999), &Oacute;l&aacute;f (<i>d</i>. 1013), Gl&uacute;niairn (<i>d</i>. 1031), Guthfrith (<i>d</i>. 1036), and Cellach (<i>d</i>. 1042).<br>
