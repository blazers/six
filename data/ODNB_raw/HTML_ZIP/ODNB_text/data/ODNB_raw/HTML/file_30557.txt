<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Balfour,  Henry</span>  (1863&#150;1939), <span class="occ">museum curator</span>, was born at 6 Bedford Villas, Dingwall Road, Croydon, on 11 April 1863, the son of Lewis Balfour (1833&#150;1885), silk broker of Croydon, and Sarah Walker Comber (1836?&#150;1916). Educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Oxford, Balfour obtained a second class in natural science (biology) in 1885. As a result of the influence of H. N. Moseley and E. B. Tylor, Balfour became interested in anthropology: even before he took his degree he and W. B. Spencer were helping Tylor and Moseley to arrange Pitt Rivers's collections, which had been given to the University of Oxford in 1883. After taking his degree Balfour continued working at the Pitt Rivers Museum. In 1887 he married Edith Marie Louise (<i>d</i>. 1938), only daughter of Robert Francis Wilkins of Kingswear, south Devon; she shared his many interests, his work, and, until her health began to suffer, his travels. They had one son. He was appointed curator of the museum in 1891, a post which he held until his death. He became a research fellow of Exeter College in 1904 and was re-elected in 1919.<br>
<br>Balfour taught technology and prehistoric archaeology for the Oxford diploma course in anthropology which began in 1907. Later he also taught for the Sudan, tropical African, Malay, and Burmese civil service courses. Balfour always lectured in the museum using the objects on display as his examples, and he learned many of the techniques employed in their manufacture and use to demonstrate to his students. Teaching gave him contact with undergraduates and with a long succession of colonial civil service probationers and of officers on leave from service overseas. In turn it led to a series of lifelong friendships which considerably enriched the collections both in numbers of objects and in the quality of documentation.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Balfour enjoyed travelling. In the earliest days his travels were connected with his continuing interest in zoology, as is to be seen in the drawings and observations in his diaries. Five times between 1905 and 1909 Balfour travelled to Norway where he studied the habits of whales and whalers. He also made a collection of artefacts for the museum. Each of his journeys was driven by the quest for knowledge and by the wish to add to the series of objects contained in the Pitt Rivers Museum. His honeymoon was spent in Lapland. In southern Africa he became the first to detect palaeolithic implements in the gravels of the Zambezi rivers and to correlate them to prehistoric European types. His visits to southern Africa were used to help him to direct knowledge of other parts of that continent. In Assam he travelled widely on foot through the Naga Hills. His most wide-ranging journey was to Australia and New Zealand and islands in Indonesia and the Pacific with a return via Japan and the USA. When he was confined to England as a result of arthritis, a voluminous correspondence with scholars worldwide enabled him to enhance the collections beyond the expected colonial heritage typical of most anthropological collections.<br>
<br>Balfour was a man of great energy and many interests. As an undergraduate he had a great reputation as oarsman and as a talented fencer, and as a lecturer, it is said, his demonstrations of boomerang throwing in the university parks led to a prohibitionary statute after he accidentally hit a nanny pushing a pram. He was a natural draughtsman; his drawings, still to be seen in the Pitt Rivers Museum displays, also enrich his travel diaries, and his command of caricature is seen in the illustrations he provided for the illustrated programmes for the Oxford University fencing club. An active member of many learned societies, Balfour became president of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1904 and of the Museums Association in 1909; he was president of the Folklore Society in 1923&#150;4, of the Royal Geographical Society from 1936 to 1938, and of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia (later the Prehistoric Society). He was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1924.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Balfour remained first and foremost a curator. He was renowned for his &#145;austere dedication&#146; to his work; left in comfortable financial circumstances after the death of his parents, he supplemented the meagre university staff allowance from his own funds. This single-mindedness was tempered by a talent for friendship, his considerable charm, and a lively sense of humour. His energy and determination gave him the strength to battle on behalf of the museum against plagues of rats, leaking roofs, and the threatened takeover by the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War. One anecdote especially serves to illustrate his dedication to the furtherance of knowledge. While cataloguing alone late one night, he accidentally cut himself with an arrow tipped with the poison curare. Knowing that there was no available antidote, and believing that his death was therefore imminent and unavoidable, he resolved to keep notes of the progressive effects of the poison for the elucidation of others. Fortunately it had degraded or otherwise lost its effectiveness, and he lived to tell the tale.<br>
<br>Balfour's powers of observation were acute, refined by his training as a zoologist, and he became an admirable collector as well as a naturalist. He was perhaps the first to demonstrate that the drumming or bleating of snipe is caused by the vibration of the outer tail-feathers, and this same analytical eye is shown in his observations made in his travel diaries. A trained scientist, he was admirably suited to curate a museum based on a system of classification. The museum owes much of its present plan of displays to Balfour. It owes its tradition of teaching to him also, together with its rich documentation of the objects in the collection.<br>
<br>The Pitt Rivers Museum absorbed Balfour's energies: collecting and documenting the objects, and then arranging and labelling them (his handwritten labels are still a much-loved feature of the museum). With the exception of <span class="italic">The Evolution of Decorative Art</span> (1893) he did not write books, but was a prolific writer of short articles on many topics, notably musical instruments, archery, anthropology, and archaeology. These articles encouraged others to send him information, all of which he added to the documentation which underpins the Pitt Rivers's collection. He was a catalyst, his articles often seminal, and many remain standard works today&#151;some of his firsthand observations remain the only accounts of practices long since discontinued. For him the museum was an important vehicle for disseminating knowledge, to his own students in the lectures he gave there, to scholars studying the collection or for the school teachers, and to children whose visits he encouraged. He saw his educational philosophy as being more widely applicable, telling the Royal Anthropological Institute in his presidential address of 1904:<blockquote>Few people have any idea of the great wealth of human interest there is buried in the data accumulated in the journals of our societies, or illustrated by the specimens locked up in the cases and drawers of our museums. It is this practically unexploited wealth of interest and information that we should endeavour to disseminate.</blockquote>The Pitt Rivers Museum remains as much a monument to Balfour's scholarship as to its founder's.<br>
<br>In 1935 the University of Oxford conferred on him the title of professor. In later years Balfour suffered from arthritis, and kept a Rolls-Royce and chauffeur to permit him to stay mobile in a degree of comfort. He died at his home, Langley Lodge, Headington, on 9 February 1939. His bequests made him one of the Pitt Rivers's major donors: he not only gave an important collection of objects but also bequeathed his library of several thousand books, which formed the founding collection of the Balfour Library.<br>
