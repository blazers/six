<span class="headword">Keenan, Sir  Patrick Joseph</span>  (1826&#150;1894), <span class="occ">educationist and educational administrator</span>, was born, probably in Dublin, the son of John Keenan of Phibsborough, Dublin, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Patrick Sherlock of Dublin. He had at least one sister. He was educated at Ratoath national school, Meath, and trained as a teaching monitor at the Central Model Schools of the Board of National Education, Marlborough Street, Dublin. In 1845 he was appointed headmaster of the Central Model Schools and in 1848 a district inspector of the national board. He rose through the ranks to become head inspector (1855), chief of inspection (1859), and resident commissioner of national education (1871&#150;94).<br>
<br>Keenan's knowledge and experience of Irish education were widely recognized. He was both the child of the national education system and its architect. In 1857 he published a pamphlet <span class="italic">Model Schools&#151;a Sketch of their Nature and Objects</span>, and in 1868 was called as a leading witness to the royal commission on primary education (Ireland). As a Catholic and exemplar civil servant he acted as adviser to and mediator between the government and the Catholic church authorities. He was an acknowledged expert in the system of &#145;payment by results&#146; which was introduced into Irish national schools in 1872, and as such was appointed by the British government to report on the education system of Trinidad in 1869 and that of Malta in 1878. In both colonies his Irish experience of the problems of language and religion in education proved invaluable.<br>
<br>Among Keenan's main achievements as resident commissioner were: the passing of the <span class="roman">Intermediate Education Act</span> (1878) which established a system of payment by results for secondary schools, based on success in public examinations; the recognition of the Irish language as an &#145;extra&#146; subject (for result fees) in national schools from 1879; the provision of state grants for denominational teacher training colleges; and the introduction of compulsory free education by the 1892 <span class="roman">Irish Education Act</span>. He also gained popularity with national schoolteachers by his official recognition of their newly formed union&#151;the Irish National Teachers' Organization. He gave evidence on Irish education to both the royal commission on technical instruction (1881&#150;4) and the royal commission on the workings of the Elementary Education Act (England and Wales) (1886&#150;8).<br>
<br>Keenan married Elizabeth Agnes, daughter of Michael Quin JP of Waterville, co. Limerick, in 1860. They had a son and a daughter. In his later years he suffered ill health and his work was curtailed. He was appointed CB (1871), KCMG (1881), a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and JP for co. Dublin; in 1885 he was sworn of the privy council. He was president of the education department of the social science congress held in Dublin in 1881. Keenan died at Delville, Glasnevin, near Dublin, on 1 November 1894 and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery.<br>
