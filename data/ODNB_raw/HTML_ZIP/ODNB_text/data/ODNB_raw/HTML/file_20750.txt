<span class="headword">O'Mahony,  Daniel</span>, Count O'Mahony in the Castilian nobility  (<em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">army officer in the French and Spanish services</span>, colloquially known as &#145;le Fameux Mahoni&#146;, was the son of John O'Mahony of Coolcorkerane, Killarney, co. Kerry, and Mary Joan Moriarty, the daughter of Thady Moriarty of Castle Drum, Dingle, co. Kerry. His brother Dermod attained the rank of colonel in James II's Irish army, distinguishing himself at the Boyne and at Aughrim before being killed in Italy while serving with the Limerick regiment about 1706. Daniel O'Mahony, having attained the rank of captain in the Royal Irish foot guards during the Williamite wars, went to France in 1692, becoming major in the Limerick and Dillon regiments successively.<br>
<br>O'Mahony served under Villeroy in northern Italy in late 1701, having command of Dillon's regiment during the absence of its colonel in January 1702, the regiment then being part of the 7000 strong garrison of the heavily fortified city of Cremona. In the early hours of 1 February O'Mahony awoke to find the Austrians under Prince Eug&egrave;ne had gained entrance to Cremona by a sewer and captured Villeroy and many French officers in their beds. Despite Austrian cavalry charging through the dark streets, he managed to rally a detachment of his regiment and held the Po gate. Over the next ten hours, although the surviving garrison was scattered in small bodies, mostly half dressed in the freezing winter weather and with few officers, this position formed the nucleus of an effective resistance to Eug&egrave;ne's occupation of the town. As O'Mahony obtained reinforcements he spread them along the ramparts, and kept up a galling fusillade on the enemy. This diversion gave the comte de Revel time to concentrate and reanimate French troops in the neighbourhood of the Mantua gate, and Eug&egrave;ne, finding himself between two fires, was forced into a precipitate retreat from the city. On account of O'Mahony's crucial service at Cremona, he was selected to carry the dispatch to Paris. Louis XIV accorded him an hour's private conference at Versailles, later relating to De Chamillart that he had never before known a person give such a fair and balanced account, yet display a personality that was both spirited yet agreeable. Saint-Simon confirmed this assessment, describing him as a man of wit and valour. Louis rewarded O'Mahony with the brevet of colonel, a pension of 1000 livres, and a present of 1000 louis d'or. From Versailles he proceeded to St Germain, where the Pretender, James III (James Francis Edward Stuart), knighted him.<br>
<br>O'Mahony continued to serve in northern Italy under Vend&ocirc;me; he was appointed governor of Brescello upon its surrender on 28 July 1703, and in January 1704 he took part in Vend&ocirc;me's successes at San Sebasti&aacute;n and Castel de Bormida before leaving Italy. Efficient officers were urgently needed in the Spanish service, and Louis XIV had recommended O'Mahony to his nephew Philip V. He was appointed colonel of his own regiment of Irish dragoons (composed largely of deserters from the British expedition to Cadiz), and during the remainder of 1704 and the whole of 1705 served with distinction under Count Tilly. While placed at Murviedro in January 1706 to block the advance of Lord Peterborough's English relief column to Valencia, O'Mahony, being heavily outnumbered, was obliged to surrender, allowing Peterborough to pass. Despite this failure, Philip appointed him mar&eacute;chal-de-camp shortly thereafter. After his promotion he stormed and sacked Enguera, and in June defended Alicante for twenty-eight days against Sir John Leake despite an inadequate garrison, ramparts requiring constant repairs, and a severe wound of his own. Although obliged to surrender on 8 September, his troops marched out with the honours of war, being transported to Cadiz without loss of service. Early in 1707 he resumed his command in Valencia, and captured several towns from the allies. At the battle of Almanza on 25 April 1707 he performed distinguished service in command of a brigade of horse that included his own regiment of Irish dragoons. On 7 July he was again badly wounded at the siege of Denia. However, by December 1707 he was again in command of some 6000 regular troops in Valencia, capturing the important town of Alcoy on 2 January 1708.<br>
<br>Appointed viceroy of Sicily in March 1709, with 3000 Spanish troops, including his own regiment of Irish dragoons, O'Mahony reached Messina in April. He suppressed several Austrian conspiracies, and his precautionary measures prevented the English fleet from landing any allied force. He returned to Spain in 1710 to command the cavalry of Philip's army, the king promoting him lieutenant-general; he had already, in 1706, been made a Castilian count. He subsequently served in the campaign of Ivaris, and on 20 August 1710 commanded the Spanish cavalry at the battle of Saragossa. Placed upon the extreme right, he opposed the Portuguese horse, which he utterly broke and drove into the Ebro. The Spanish cavalry, however, proved ill-disciplined and despite his best endeavours impetuously charged, riding over the enemy's artillery and far into their rear. In the meantime the main body of Philip's army had been defeated and was in retreat. O'Mahony rejoined it with the utmost difficulty. Although criticized for losing control of his men at Saragossa, he gained distinction at the head of Vend&ocirc;me's cavalry at the battle of Villaviciosa on 10 December 1710, Philip rewarding him by appointing him commander of the military order of St Iago. He led the pursuit into Aragon, capturing the stronghold of Illueca and Lieutenant-General Dom Antonio de Villar&ouml;el with a detachment of 660 men. He continued to act in Spain under Vend&ocirc;me until the cessation of hostilities in 1712, when he returned to France, where Louis XIV ennobled him. Before the end of that year O'Mahony, whose first wife, Cecily (Cecilia), daughter of George Weld of the old Catholic family of Lulworth Castle, Dorset, had died about 1708, married Charlotte, widow of Charles O'Brien, fifth Viscount Clare, and a sister of the duchess of Berwick, at St Germain. He did not, however, long survive his second marriage, dying at Ocana in Spain in January 1714. By his first marriage he left two sons, the elder being John Joseph, second Count O'Mahony, whose career included positions as lieutenant-general in the army of the Two Sicilies, inspector-general of cavalry and dragoons, governor of San Elmo, and commander of the order of Saint Januarius. His granddaughter Cecilia, styled Countess Mahony, married in May 1757 Benedetto, Prince Giustiniani. The younger son, Demetrius, became Spain's ambassador to Austria, dying at Vienna in 1776. Neither son left male descendants.<br>
