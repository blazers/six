<span class="headword">Ashbridge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sampson]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1713&#150;1755), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born in Middlewich, Cheshire, the daughter of Thomas Sampson, a ship's surgeon, and his wife, Mary. Few details are known about Elizabeth's early life, parents, and family; indeed, most of the information about her later life and career is taken from her spiritual autobiography (composed about 1745), which records her &#145;remarkable experiences&#146; (the title of some versions of the narrative indicated) after she left home aged fourteen. About 1727 she eloped with, and married, a stocking weaver, who died within the year. Elizabeth now estranged herself from her father and travelled from Cheshire to Ireland, where she lived with relatives. Here she may have earned a living by working as a servant or, perhaps, in prostitution. In 1732 she left for America; having landed at New York she signed as an indentured servant for four years. Her autobiography records how this period was taken up with an exploration of several religious denominations, culminating in her departure from the Anglican faith of her childhood for the Quakers. Having escaped the possibility of sexual abuse from her American master, Elizabeth bought her freedom through work as a seamstress. She also flirted for a brief period with a theatrical career in New York, having joined with a group of actors who promised she would &#145;live like a lady&#146; if she devoted herself to the stage. Her second marriage was to a man by the name of Sullivan (further details are unknown), who was attracted by her blithe spirit and her dancing; the couple supported themselves as teachers.<br>
<br>During visits to relatives who were Friends, Elizabeth came into close contact with a wide range of Quakers. She now began to adopt the outward signs of belief such as plain speech and clothing, and almost immediately began to endure persecution from her husband. On one of these occasions, cited as the infamous tavern scene in Philadelphia, Sullivan forced her to dance with him as she did before she became &#145;a Stiff Quaker&#146;. As he &#145;pluck'd [her] round the Room till Tears affected [her] eyes&#146;, the musician was moved to stop his playing  (&#145;Some account&#146;, reprinted in Andrews, 162). Although scenes of verbal and physical abuse continued throughout her marriage, Elizabeth remained faithful to Sullivan, believing he would eventually convert. He did finally claim membership of the Society of Friends, as indicated by his refusal to fight in Cuba in 1740 when he claimed that he had only enlisted as a soldier &#145;in a drunken frolick&#146;  (ibid., 170). Sullivan apparently died nine months later as a result of the abuse he received from the military authorities following his refusal to fight. He died &pound;80 in debt, obligations which Elizabeth paid off by teaching and sewing. Her spiritual autobiography concludes with the death of her second husband. In 1746 she married Aaron Ashbridge (<i>d</i>. 1776), a member of a comfortable Quaker farming family from Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>This union appears to have provided Elizabeth Ashbridge with the financial, emotional, and community support she needed to thrive as a Quaker preacher. In 1753 she chose to travel as a minister to Ireland, perhaps to escape what may have been becoming an increasingly unhappy marriage. During the late 1740s Aaron Ashbridge had risen to prominence in the local community as an overseer of the Society of Friends' Goshen meeting (1748) and a justice of the peace a year later. However, he was accused of public drunkenness and was removed from the Goshen meeting in 1755. On his death he left &pound;300 for the education of poor children, an indication of the financial comfort Elizabeth enjoyed.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Ashbridge's autobiography enjoyed sufficient popularity to circulate in several manuscript copies in the first couple of decades after its completion. The first printed version was published in England at Nantwich, Cheshire, in 1774; numerous British and American editions appeared during the nineteenth century. Elizabeth's life and testimony gained wider scholarly attention in the late twentieth century as women's studies and the study of life-writing became increasingly popular. The autobiography has been republished in several anthologies, and Ashbridge is now the subject of studies on eighteenth-century women's lives and Quaker culture. She died on 16 May 1755 in the home of Robert Lecky at Kilnock, co. Carlow, Ireland, after contracting a &#145;severe illness&#146;, and was interred in the Quaker burial-ground, Ballybromhill, co. Carlow.<br>
