<span class="headword">&AElig;thelnoth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1038), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was a son of &AElig;thelm&aelig;r, ealdorman of the western shires, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8918/', "Ealdorman &#198;thelweard")</script>, the chronicler. A Glastonbury story relates that, at his baptism by Dunstan, the infant held up his hand in the manner of a bishop blessing the people, whereupon Dunstan prophesied that he would become an archbishop. &AElig;thelnoth became a monk of Glastonbury, and in later years, besides enlisting Cnut's support for Glastonbury, he donated to it a copy of Hrabanus Maurus's <span class="italic">De laudibus sanctae crucis</span>, and also a prayer book illuminated in gold. According to Osbern, &AElig;thelnoth enjoyed Cnut's favour because he had given holy chrism to the king, implying his participation either in a ceremony of confirmation at Southampton in 1016, or else in Cnut's coronation by Archbishop Lyfing in 1017. &AElig;thelnoth's brother &AElig;thelweard was executed by Cnut in 1017, while a brother-in-law, also called &AElig;thelweard, was banished in 1020.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelnoth was dean of Christ Church, Canterbury, when, in 1020, he was elected archbishop, an elevation which may denote a reconciliation between the king and the survivors of &AElig;thelm&aelig;r's family. Archbishop Wulfstan of York notified King Cnut and Queen Emma that he had consecrated &AElig;thelnoth according to the king's mandate, and urged that &AElig;thelnoth should be entitled to the same rights and honours as Dunstan and his other predecessors in office. The consecration took place on 13 November 1020. In 1022, &AElig;thelnoth travelled to Rome and received his pallium from Pope Benedict VIII, who is said, in three versions of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, to have consecrated and blessed him with great solemnity on 7 October. On the pope's instructions, &AElig;thelnoth immediately celebrated mass, wearing the pallium, and afterwards they dined together in state. The D text of the chronicle adds that &AElig;thelnoth afterwards took a pallium from the altar before leaving Rome. The archbishop returned to England with an arm of St Augustine of Hippo in an ornate reliquary, which he gave to Coventry; it cost him 100 talents of silver and one  of gold.<br>
<br>In 1023 King Cnut gave permission for the translation of the remains of the murdered Archbishop &AElig;lfheah (Alphege) to Canterbury. The cort&egrave;ge set out on 8 June, and the account in the chronicle (text D) indicates the dignified and public nature of the journey. Osbern, however, reports that the relics were strongly guarded and followed by &AElig;thelnoth with a rearguard, in order to thwart any intervention by hostile citizens of London. The procession entered Christ Church, Canterbury, on 11 June, and four days later &AElig;thelnoth, together with Bishop &AElig;lfsige of Winchester and Bishop Brihtwine of Wells, reinterred &AElig;lfheah's body. The archbishop encouraged Cnut to send money to foreign churches, including Chartres, and restrained him when he spoke disparagingly of St Edith while visiting Wilton. &AElig;thelnoth was politically useful to Cnut in consecrating Bishop Gerbrand of Roskilde, and in acting with Cnut to strengthen the position of Bishop Joseph of Llandaff; he was also a co-recipient of the letter sent by Cnut to his English subjects following his visit to Rome. Cnut issued several writs in favour of the archbishop and his church. The <span class="italic">Encomium Emmae Reginae</span> relates that, following Cnut's death, his son Harold Harefoot summoned &AElig;thelnoth, &#145;a man endowed with great courage and wisdom&#146;, requiring the archbishop to consecrate him king, and to hand over the crown and sceptre, but the archbishop refused to consecrate anyone other than a son of Emma, and forbade all the bishops from participating in a consecration. The implied date of this story is 1036, at which time there was a possibility that Harthacnut would return to England. Harold was elected king in 1037, and Gervase reports that &AElig;thelnoth crowned him in London. In &AElig;thelnoth's last years, some of his duties were taken over by the royal priest Eadsige. &AElig;thelnoth &#145;the Good&#146; (as the chronicle calls him) died on 28 or 29 October, or else on 1 November, 1038, and was buried in Christ Church, Canterbury. &AElig;thelric, bishop of Sussex, is said to have prayed that he would not long survive &#145;his dearly beloved father&#146; &AElig;thelnoth, and he himself duly died a week later.<br>
