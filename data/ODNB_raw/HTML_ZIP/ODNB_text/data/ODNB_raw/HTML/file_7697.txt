</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon,  George</span>  (1820&#150;1898), <span class="occ">educational reformer and politician</span>, was born on 21 July 1820 at Gomersal, Yorkshire, the fourth son in the family of five sons and three daughters of Abraham Dixon (<i>d</i>. 1850), merchant and inventor in the woollen textile industry, of Whitehaven in Cumberland, and his wife, Laetitia (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of John Taylor of Gomersal. He was educated at Leeds grammar school (1829&#150;37) and travelled to France to learn the language in 1837&#150;8. He then followed his brother Abraham (1815&#150;1907) into employment with Rabone Bros. &amp; Co., foreign merchants of Birmingham. He became a partner in 1844 and succeeded his brother as head of the firm, on whose behalf he spent some time in Australia. On 11 September 1855 he married Mary (1832&#150;1885), youngest daughter of Judge James Stansfeld of the Halifax county court, and sister of James Stansfeld.<br>
<br>Dixon came to public attention as an active member of the Birmingham and Edgbaston Debating Society, in which local politicians learned and practised the art of public speaking. He was known for his donations to the poor, his promotion of the rifle volunteer movement in Birmingham (December 1859), and his generous lead in securing Aston Hall for the town in September 1866. He was president of the Birmingham chamber of commerce from 1867 to 1877, and again in 1886. He became a magistrate (1864), town councillor for the Edgbaston ward (1863), and, in November 1866, mayor of Birmingham. In June 1867 his decisive action averted sectarian disorder during Catholic riots against the protestant demagogue William Murphy.<br>
<br>Dixon detested religious bigotry of all kinds. Early in 1867 he began a series of Birmingham conferences to represent various religious and political opinions on the state of education. It was resolved that the municipal corporation should levy a rate for education and curb the employment of uninstructed young children. Dixon, supported by Joseph Chamberlain, advocated a compulsory education system, but this was controversial in view of its proposed non-sectarian, and indeed secular, aspects. The Birmingham Education Society was founded by Dixon and others, using their own resources, to extend school provision and pay the fees of the poorer children. In 1869 Dixon was elected president of the National Education League, founded by himself, Chamberlain, John Sandford, George Dawson, and R. W. Dale, to press for a national education system in England and Wales.<br>
<br>Dixon's educational interests assisted his election as Liberal MP for Birmingham in July 1867. In a maiden speech to the Commons  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 12 March 1868) he asserted that three causes were uppermost in the minds of the working-class electorate which he represented: justice for Ireland through the disestablishment of the Irish church; justice for themselves through abolition of the rate-paying clauses relating to the recent Reform Act; justice for their children through the extension and improvement of national education. Dixon supported a <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> (10 June 1868) and was concerned about the adulteration of food and drink, the powers of the board of guardians, election expenses, the provision of rifles for India, and the bankruptcy laws. He wished the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> to be impartially administered  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Biographia</span>, 1872&#150;5). He argued the case for representative government with radical working men  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span>, April 1872).<br>
<br>Dixon's arguments for the improvement of national education were based on the need for a skilled workforce to meet overseas competition  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 24 March 1868). On the introduction of W. E. Forster's bill in 1870, Dixon dropped his own proposals and generally voted in support, but, prompted by Chamberlain, he moved a hostile amendment to the second reading, opposing the provision that religious instruction should be determined by local authorities. On 5 March 1872 he pressed for the establishment of school boards in rural as well as urban areas. In 1874 he failed in an attempt to make school attendance compulsory, which he repeated with the support of the Agricultural Labourers' Union during 1875&#150;6.<br>
<br>Suffering from pressure of work and anxious about his wife's health, in June 1876 Dixon admitted his intention to resign his parliamentary seat knowing that it would pass to Chamberlain, whom he greatly admired, though his decision was forced by an announcement in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>. He had served on the Birmingham school board since 1870 and now replaced Chamberlain as its chairman (1876), though the latter tried to maintain his influence over the board in favour of secularism. This caused a temporary estrangement between the two men, to Dixon's great regret. Himself a moderate Anglican, he came to support <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading without comment in board schools, with religious teaching and prayer on a voluntary basis. He advocated compulsory attendance, better provision for basic literacy, and the growth of technical education in the upper standards VI and VII. In 1884 he equipped at his own expense the Bridge Street seventh grade school, which later perpetuated his name, and which served as a model of its type. He advocated a trained and fully qualified teaching profession through queen's scholarships, day training colleges, and rewards to certificated teachers. His speeches to the Birmingham school board were published as policy documents in 1881 and 1889.<br>
<br>When the parliamentary boundaries of Birmingham were extended in 1885 Dixon returned to the Commons as MP for the Edgbaston division in November of that year. Although he expressed anti-imperialist views during the Suez Canal crisis of 1883, he separated from Gladstone on the issue of home rule for Ireland, which he opposed in 1885&#150;6, falling silent on all but educational issues in parliament. He took a prominent part in the round-table conference of 1887, which unsuccessfully attempted to achieve Liberal reunion, and later pressed for Conservative concessions in return for Unionist support. His voyage to Cape Town and New Zealand in 1888 increased his concern for imperial trade, but he threatened resignation over rating reform and subsidy to the agricultural interest in his later years  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</span>, 25 January 1898). He strongly opposed Sir John Gorst's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> on the grounds that it tilted financial provision towards voluntary agencies and away from school boards  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 1 Feb 1897), and revived the National Education League to campaign against it.<br>
<br>Dixon died of heart and kidney failure at his residence, The Dales, 42 Augustus Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 24 January 1898. He received no public honours apart from the freedom of the city of Birmingham on 4 January, shortly before his death. He protested that he wanted recognition only from those with whom he had worked for so long  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Biographia</span>, 941&#150;2). His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> stressed his achievement as an educational reformer, his conscientious public work, and kindness of heart, while noting his lack of humour and limited power of oratory. Joseph Chamberlain's tribute to him as a vice-president of the Unionist Party in Birmingham referred to his services to education and strenuous opposition to home rule: &#145;a tower of strength to us&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26, 27 Jan 1898). Chamberlain's late colleague may, however, have been less &#145;simple-minded&#146; than he supposed. Dixon's funeral on the 28th matched his importance, and its interdenominational character, Jewish as well as Christian, was noted  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</span>, 30 Jan 1898). He was buried in Witton cemetery.<br>
