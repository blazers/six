<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Emily</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 18 September 1807 at 47 Paternoster Row, London, one of seven children of Robert Baldwin (1780&#150;1858), publisher, and his wife, Maria, daughter of Henry Baldwin, a leading City publisher and printer. Both her parents were members of the large Baldwin family, whose activities in publishing dated back to the seventeenth century. Her father started the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in 1820, and her uncle Charles Baldwin was founder of <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, a conservative newspaper. Her home background was cultured and literary and she benefited from a scholarly mother. But nothing is known of Emily Baldwin's education or indeed what led her into a career in teaching. She is known to have run a school at Leamington, and for fourteen years, immediately prior to her appointment at Howell's School, she was head of a highly successful school at Notting Hill.<br>
<br>Emily Baldwin was already fifty-three years of age and an experienced headmistress when she was appointed as &#145;chief matron&#146; of Howell's School, Llandaff, an Anglican school closely associated with the cathedral. Her own religious sympathies were high-church Anglican. The school was a new foundation, one of two boarding-schools for the education of female orphans erected in Wales, the other being at Denbigh, by the Drapers' Company of the City of London. Thomas Howell, a Monmouthshire draper, who died in 1540, had left a sum of money in his will to provide dowries for female orphans. By the nineteenth century, when the legacy was providing an income of some &pound;2000 per annum, a long legal wrangle had arisen over the Drapers' administration of the charity and, following rulings by the court of chancery and an act of parliament (1852), the schools, the first endowed schools for girls in Wales, were built. Emily Baldwin was appointed by the court of chancery in London.<br>
<br>A small, well-built woman with a strong nose and determined chin, wearing her hair in out-dated ringlets and attired in the beribboned cap and voluminous petticoats of an earlier decade, Miss Baldwin made her mark on the school at Llandaff. She brought diplomacy, cheerfulness, and perseverance, as well as a commitment to high standards of academic achievement, to her role as headmistress. She was to need all these qualities in dealing with the all-male board of governors, including the influential Alfred Ollivant, bishop of Llandaff, and the Drapers' Company, which controlled the expenditure of the school.<br>
<br>Emily Baldwin's achievement during the years of her headship (1860&#150;72) was to transform the image of the school at Llandaff from a charity foundation into a highly regarded girls' school. From the outset the school took paying boarders, and within a few years also took day girls, as well as orphans. The first intakes of girls, both orphans and paying pupils, were drawn from the class of small traders, clerks, and farmers, but by the early 1870s the school catered largely for the middle class, attracting the daughters of professional men, the clergy, and army officers. While most girls' charity residential schools provided only a basic elementary education, the curriculum at Llandaff covered &#145;the principles of the Christian Religion, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, Biography, History, the Elements of Astronomy, Garden Botany, Music, French, Drawing and such subjects as the Governors may direct&#146;  (Letter books 1859&#150;64). In the course of the 1860s it was further expanded to include geometry, Italian, and Latin. Miss Baldwin made constant demands on the Drapers' Company to buy books, lists of which she drew up herself, and to provide well-qualified teachers. While her academic aspirations for her pupils are clear, the traditional female accomplishments, such as music and drawing, were also taught, and the original scheme for the school had laid down that all girls should be taught needlework.<br>
<br>Emily Baldwin ran the school efficiently and with authority. Her regime, however, unlike that of many of her contemporaries, was characterized by kindliness and common sense. She ensured that the food was appetizing, that there were novels and story books in the library as well as academic texts, and that the younger girls had shuttlecocks and hoops. She taught the children herself, gave rewards for achievement, and encouraged pupils with problems to come to her personally. Under Miss Baldwin there was no corporal punishment at Llandaff, and as one member of staff recorded: &#145;I never saw Miss Baldwin strike a child&#146;  (McCann, 93). Her obituary in the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> (6 December 1880) singled out not only her ability and assiduity but her &#145;affection for the pupils which characterized her administration and won for her, not only the esteem of the governors but the affectionate regard of all those who were under her charge&#146;.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Emily Baldwin had any connection with the feminist movement in education. The historian of the school, Jean McCann, noting that Miss Buss had founded North London Collegiate School in 1850 and Miss Beale had become headmistress of Cheltenham Ladies' College in 1857, states, &#145;it would appear not a ripple reached Llandaff&#146;. Ill health forced Emily to retire, aged sixty-five, in 1872 on a meagre pension from the Drapers' Company, the insolvency of her father's publishing business having left the family in straitened circumstances. She returned to London, living at times with her spinster sisters and at times alone in a series of lodgings. Emily Baldwin died on 2 December 1880 at 34 Coleherne Road, South Kensington, London.<br>
