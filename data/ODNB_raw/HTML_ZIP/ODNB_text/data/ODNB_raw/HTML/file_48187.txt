<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Siddeley,  John Davenport</span>, first Baron Kenilworth  (1866&#150;1953), <span class="occ">manufacturer of motor vehicles and aero-engines</span>, was born on 5 August 1866 at Cheadle Hulme, the eldest son of William Siddeley and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davenport. He was no academic, and left school to work in his father's business as an apprentice hosier. The meagre rewards led him to enrol in evening classes, where he developed his mechanical acumen to the extent that in 1885 he began designing bicycles. On 9 March 1893 he married Sarah Mabel Goodier (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of James Goodier of Macclesfield. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Siddeley's design work took him to Beeston with the Humber cycle company, whence he became Dunlop's sales manager in Belfast, before returning to the midlands to run Dunlop's subsidiary, the Clipper Tyre Company. For publicity, Siddeley became the first person to ride a bicycle from John o' Groats to Land's End. He then became involved with motor cars, at first through pneumatic tyres, which led him to form the Siddeley Autocar Company in 1902, utilizing Peugeot designs under licence. His success persuaded Wolseley to hire him and there he honed his management skills before resigning as general manager in 1909. He became managing director of the struggling Deasy Motor Car Manufacturing Company in Coventry and so transformed its position that the marque was renamed Siddeley-Deasy.<br>
<br>The war was the making of the company, leading first to government orders for lorries and motor cars and then, most significantly, to aero-engine and airframe production. Siddeley persuaded the directors to sanction a move into the aviation field. Siddeley's engineers resolved the teething problems of the Beardmore-Halford-Pullinger aero-engine and it became the Siddeley Puma; it proved so reliable that it was the principal design in use by British bombers at the war's conclusion. The engineering staff was considerably strengthened when a number of distinguished personnel arrived from the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough in 1917.<br>
<br>To support his ambitious post-war plans, Siddeley arranged a take-over by the armaments and shipbuilding giant Armstrong Whitworth, in April 1919, with Siddeley-Deasy becoming Armstrong Siddeley Motors. Later, in July 1920, Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth Aircraft Ltd was formed. Both companies were under the umbrella of a holding company, the Armstrong Whitworth Development Company. During the 1920s Armstrong Siddeley compensated for depressed home sales through overseas demand, especially from the Australasian dominions. Siddeley was also always willing to explore new fields&#151;Armstrong Siddeley even brought out an electric cinema projector with a patented device to eliminate flicker. Siddeley made successful strides into the armaments field, receiving a knighthood in 1932 for the tank engine supplied to Vickers.<br>
<br>The major success story of the decade was with the Jaguar air-cooled aero-engine, which was developed from a Farnborough design with Siddeley insistently prodding on the project. Its success was such that until the late 1920s Armstrong Siddeley was the major recipient of government orders for military aero-engines. Siddeley utilized this favourable position to full advantage by having airframes designed around the Jaguar. The Siskin 3A single-seater fighter aircraft was a notable outcome. The Jaguar was also a huge success abroad, with orders generated by record-breaking flights orchestrated by Siddeley. In civil aviation, the Armstrong Whitworth Argosy entered service with Imperial Airways in 1926 powered by three Jaguars.<br>
<br>The ailing fortunes of the parent company provided Siddeley with the opportunity to gain control of his companies. This was achieved with a loan of &pound;1.5 million, most of which was arranged by Reginald McKenna, chairman of the Midland Bank. By February 1927 Siddeley was chairman of all three, with the holding company renamed the Armstrong Siddeley Development Company. In his final years, Siddeley expanded his business empire through a number of astute take-overs, which included the aeronautics firm A. V. Roe, the piston supplier Peter Hooker (which became High Duty Alloys), and Improved Gears Ltd (later Self-Changing Gears), whose gearbox was highly successful.<br>
<br>While Siddeley was enjoying his success with the Jaguar engine his rivals, especially Bristol and Rolls-Royce, were busy producing high-power designs which Armstrong Siddeley was unable to match in the 1930s. Siddeley has been accused of complacency, of not devoting sufficient funds to research and development, and of undue interference with engine design, which led two of his major designers to leave. The death of two other critical engine staff was also crucial in diminishing Armstrong Siddeley's design capabilities, while Siddeley's reputation as a domineering employer deterred others of similar calibre from filling the vacancies. A major blow was sustained in 1934 when the Air Ministry preferred the Bristol-powered Gloster Gauntlet to the Armstrong Whitworth Scimitar.<br>
<br>Fortunately for Armstrong Whitworth the Air Ministry, concerned at German re-armament, decided to place orders straight from the drawing board without awaiting the results of prototype trials, and asked the company to supply its Whitley bomber on this basis. It was not a happy choice; the aircraft was late going into production and Lord Weir, industrial adviser to the Air Ministry, wanted outside assistance brought in, but doubted if Siddeley would accept. Although the Whitley was eventually mass-produced, its shortcomings were soon exposed when war came.<br>
<br>By 1935 Siddeley was nearing seventy. He had accumulated a large personal fortune and had no need to continue working. He arranged a merger with Hawker, for which he received &pound;1 million and numerous benefits, officially retiring from his executive positions on 30 September 1936. Siddeley became a tax exile in Jersey, while maintaining several British homes. In 1937 he purchased Kenilworth Castle and the same year was created Baron Kenilworth.<br>
<br>A rigid disciplinarian at home, as he was at work, Siddeley had a lighter side, indulging in painting and gardening. His gifts to charity were considerable, totalling over &pound;300,000 in his last eighteen years. He died at the Bon Air Nursing Home, St Saviour, Jersey, on 3 November 1953, heartbroken by the death of his wife a fortnight earlier. His estate in England was valued at &pound;354,597 (though his total wealth was probably much greater). He was succeeded as second baron by his son Cyril (1894&#150;1971), who in 1958 presented Kenilworth Castle to the local council, which transferred responsibility for its upkeep to English Heritage in 1984.<br>
