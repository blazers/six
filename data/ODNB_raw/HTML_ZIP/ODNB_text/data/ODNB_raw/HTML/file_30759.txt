<span class="headword">Amoroso,  Emmanuel Ciprian</span>  (1901&#150;1982), <span class="occ">veterinary embryologist and endocrinologist</span>, was born on 16 September 1901 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the third child in the family of eight sons (one of them adopted) and three daughters of Thomas Amoroso, bookkeeper and later estate owner, and his wife, Juliana Centeno. After attending St Thomas's preparatory school, Trinidad, in 1913 he entered St Mary's College, Trinidad, and took the junior Cambridge certificate examination in 1917. Amoroso left school early after suffering an attack of typhoid which left him virtually blind in one eye. At the age of twenty-one he nevertheless arrived in Dublin where he enrolled in University College at the National University in Ireland. He supported himself at first by selling newspapers outside the main railway station and later by teaching anatomy. An outstanding student, he won several prizes and in the final medical examination he achieved the highest marks ever attained. He graduated BSc in 1926 and MB BCh BAO (Dublin) in 1929. He also found time to become a useful amateur heavyweight boxer. In 1930 he was awarded a travelling studentship which enabled him to undertake postgraduate studies in Berlin and Freiburg. To ensure that he could read scientific publications in the original text and to avoid any bias introduced by another translator, Amo, as he was by then universally known, began to learn all the European languages. He was to become a highly competent linguist. After his period of study in Germany he moved to University College, London, where his interest in experimental embryology was excited and in 1934 he obtained his PhD degree, the first of a bewildering array of higher degrees and fellowships from many parts of the world.<br>
<br>In 1934 Amoroso joined the Royal Veterinary College as a senior assistant in charge of histology and embryology. Amoroso's most difficult task on joining the college was to overcome the racism of many of his academic colleagues who thought him &#145;not even the equal of that sprinkling of Asian students whom it was his duty to teach. Even his professor, James McCunn, turned against him, and the students were encouraged to do likewise&#146;  (Short, 7). The support of a handful of staff and outsiders helped Amoroso to survive this difficult period.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1936 Amoroso began a short-lived marriage to Elsie Mary (&#145;Peter&#146;) Pole 
    (or Harvey; <i>b</i>. 1903/4)
  , daughter of Henry Pole, an accountant. There were no children. After his marriage failed he remained a private and rather lonely person.<br>
<br>In 1948 Amoroso was appointed to the chair of physiology at the Royal Veterinary College and for a while also acted as professor of anatomy. In 1950 he became professor of veterinary physiology at London University. In 1957 he was elected FRS; he also held fellowships of the Royal College of Physicians (1966), Royal College of Surgeons (1960), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1965), and Royal College of Pathologists (1973). He became an honorary associate of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (1959) and of the British Veterinary Association. In 1964 he was awarded the MD of the National University of Ireland. He held numerous honorary doctorates.<br>
<br>Amoroso's interests and research ranged over an extraordinarily diverse group of subjects including cancer and the first studies of the seried veins of the neck of the giraffe. However, his greatest contribution to knowledge lay in the field of reproductive biology, notably in studies of the structure and function of the placenta. He published many papers and stimulating reviews but much of his thought, philosophy, and work was encapsulated in his outstanding chapter in volume 2 of <span class="italic">Marshall's Physiology of Reproduction</span> (3rd edn, ed. A. S. Parkes, 1952). Amoroso was awarded the Mary Marshall medal of the Society of Fertility and the Carl Hartman medal of the Society for the Study of Reproduction. It was, however, the presentation of the Dale medal by the Society for Endocrinology at the symposium on 29 September 1981 to honour his eightieth birthday which gave him particular pleasure and delighted his many friends and colleagues.<br>
<br>Amoroso was a practical supporter of the learned societies with which he concerned himself and several benefited from his financial acumen. As a chairman of scientific meetings he was outstanding. He possessed the ability to distil complex arguments and to identify key facts from which he presented a lucid and elegant summary. His mastery of the English language was complete and generations of students were captivated by the literary flair of this man who was slightly larger than life with a touch of flamboyance&#151;cigar, pocket handkerchief, and bow-tie&#151;who referred to himself as an Afro-Saxon. He was an inspired teacher as well as research worker and set many others on the road to scientific success. Yet he had time for the less successful and did not forget the difficulties he faced in his early life or the help he received. It was an indication of the impact he made on students and on veterinary preclinical teaching that twenty years after his retirement and six years after his death a new award for outstanding veterinary preclinical research should be designated the Amoroso award.<br>
<br>On Amoroso's retirement in 1968 the University of London conferred on him the title of emeritus professor and the Royal Veterinary College awarded him its highest honour by making him a fellow. In 1969 Amoroso was appointed CBE and in 1977 he received the Trinity cross, the highest national award of Trinidad and Tobago. Retirement only marked a further stage in his veterinary career and was followed by a series of visiting professorships and other posts in Santiago, Sydney, Nairobi, and Guelph and by a long period as special professor in the University of Nottingham. He was slowed only by incipient heart disease and continued to work at the Institute of Animal Physiology at Babraham before he died on 30 October 1982 at the home of some friends in Leeds. A memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Babraham, on 6 January 1983 for his close friends and colleagues; this was followed by a memorial mass at the church of St Anselm and St Cecilia, Kingsway, London, on 28 February.<br>
