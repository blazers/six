<span class="headword">Blomfield,  Edward Valentine</span>  (1788&#150;1816), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 14 February 1788, the second son of Charles Blomfield, a schoolmaster at Bury St Edmunds, and his wife, Hester Pawsey, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2668/', "Charles James Blomfield")</script>, bishop of London. He was educated under Dr M. T. Becher (1764&#150;1809) at the grammar school in Bury St Edmunds and proceeded from there to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1807. In 1811 he took his BA degree as thirteenth wrangler. He had, however, obtained such classical distinctions as were then open to competition; he was Browne's medallist in 1809 and 1810, members' prizeman in 1812, and finally first chancellor's classical medallist. The fellowships in his own college being full, he was elected in 1813 to a classical lectureship and fellowship at Emmanuel, and was ordained in the same year. He died from a fever contracted in a long vacation tour in Switzerland in 1816. He managed, after being taken ill at Dover, to reach Cambridge where he died in his rooms at Emmanuel College on 9 October 1816, and was buried in Emmanuel College chapel.<br>
<br>Blomfield acquired a high reputation for learning and general accomplishments, being a good modern linguist and draughtsman, as well as a brilliant scholar. His chief work was a translation of the Greek grammar compiled by A. H. Matthiae. Completed in the spring of 1816, it was left for his brother Charles James to edit. Blomfield had met with Matthiae's book in the course of a tour in Germany, undertaken in 1813, as soon as the events of that year had opened the continent to English travellers. Another fruit of this tour was a paper in the <span class="italic">Museum Criticum</span> entitled &#145;The state of classical literature in Germany&#146;, a subject which had then become almost unknown in England. Besides a few other papers contributed to the <span class="italic">Museum</span> Blomfield had projected a Greek&#150;English lexicon to take the place of the old Greek&#150;Latin lexicons of Scapula and Hedericus, which gave needless difficulty to students and were neither full nor accurate. He published a specimen of his lexicon, which was well received, and his plans seem to have been rational and promising. Had Blomfield lived, some of the labours of H. G. Liddell and his fellow lexicographer Robert Scott might have been anticipated.<br>
