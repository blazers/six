<span class="headword">Watts,  John</span>  (1818&#150;1887), <span class="occ">educationist and social reformer</span>, was born at Coventry, on 24 March 1818, one of twelve children of James Watts, ribbon weaver. When five years old, scarlet fever left him partially paralysed. He was educated largely at Holy Trinity church school in Coventry, where he came under the influence of the Revd W. F. Hook, and despite strongly non-denominational religious beliefs, subsequently retained his connection with the Church of England.<br>
<br>Watts began his working life as general assistant, librarian, and assistant secretary of the Coventry Mechanics' Institute. From early 1840 he served as an Owenite social missionary in the east midlands, the Manchester district, and Glasgow. After the curtailment of the Owenite lecturing organization in the spring of 1841, he was eventually, in October 1841, appointed lecturer and teacher at the Manchester Hall of Science. Until abandoning this post in June 1844 and setting up as a tailor, he lectured and debated regularly in Manchester and the surrounding area. In October 1844 he married Catherine Shaw, of Coventry; they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In July 1844 Watts obtained a PhD from the University of Giessen for a revision of his lectures on political economy, <span class="italic">The Facts and Fictions of Political Economists</span> (1842), which influenced the early economic ideas of Friedrich Engels. Watts flirted briefly with trade unionism in 1850, editing the <span class="italic">Trades Advocate</span> for the engineering unions. Subsequently, his lectures (including a paper to the British Association in 1861 which was widely discussed), numerous pamphlets, and extensive newspaper correspondence, concentrated almost exclusively on rigid Cobdenite attacks on trade unionism and strikes.<br>
<br>In the periods 1844&#150;51 and 1857&#150;62, Watts was involved in a range of social reforms, including the public parks movement and the Manchester Free Public Library scheme (begun on his initiative), which, alongside his championing of an amalgam of Cobdenite economics and Chartist politics, enabled him to become a pivotal figure in the realignment of working-class radicalism in Manchester. He remained a committed Liberal and democrat, and served on the committee of the Manchester National Association for Women's Suffrage. Otherwise, after 1864, despite serving as secretary of the Manchester Reform Club from 1867, he largely stood aloof from politics and committed himself to furthering the two enduring legacies of his Owenism: the amelioration of the conditions of the working classes, and a universal system of national education.<br>
<br>In February 1851 Watts was appointed the full-time agent of the National Public Schools Association (NPSA), for which he lectured extensively in 1851, before spending considerable time in London in 1852 and 1853 assisting the association's witnesses (of which he himself was one) before the select committee on education in Manchester and Salford. Although thereafter the NPSA campaign quickly faded, Watts remained active in several local efforts to demonstrate the inadequacy of the voluntary system, including the Manchester Education Aid Society. After the 1866 social science congress he took a leading role, especially in drafting the vital twenty-fifth (&#145;Cowper&#150;Temple&#146;) clause, in a committee which framed H. A. Bruce's 1868 <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, the basis for the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> of 1870. From its inception in 1870 until his death Watts was one of the non-sectarian party members of the Manchester school board, being instrumental in the early adoption of the compulsory education clauses and remaining at the forefront of the struggle to extend the board's activities. He fought hard to preserve and extend free educational provision at the Manchester grammar school. As &#145;Earnest&#146; he led the campaign of 1862&#150;3 to reform the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Mechanics' Institutes, serving as its chairman from 1872 to 1886. He became a campaigner for scientific and technical education, and was chairman of the Manchester Technical School (which he helped to create out of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute) and secretary of the extension committee of Owens College.<br>
<br>In 1853 Watts accepted the position as promoter of the People's Provident Assurance Society (later the European), travelling extensively in 1853&#150;4 selling shares and appointing agents. From 1854 to 1857 his directorship required residency in London, after which he returned to Manchester as district agent. The traumatic failure of the European at the end of the 1860s caused a breakdown in Watts's health, and during a period of recuperation in Torquay in the winter of 1866&#150;7, he drafted what became the 1870 <span class="roman">Life Assurance Act</span>. The failure of the European did not prevent Watts continuing as an insurance broker and commercial arbitrator.<br>
<br>While living in London, Watts gave vigorous support to the Association for the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge, deploying his logical mind to help frame the parliamentary questions with which Thomas Milner-Gibson MP fronted the campaign. He served as sub-treasurer from 1856 and treasurer from 1870. From 1878 until his death he was also treasurer of the travelling tax abolition committee.<br>
<br>Although he eschewed direct organizational involvement, Watts was an enthusiastic advocate of the co-operative movement. The influential articles entitled &#145;What is co-operation?&#146;, which appeared in the early issues of the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span> (1872&#150;3) and established Watts's position as the leading advocate of the &#145;federalist position&#146;, demonstrate that he never lost his belief in the transformative power of co-operation. Nevertheless, tension remained between the visionary remnants of his Owenism and a more prosaic preoccupation with thrift, and his later newspaper controversies with E. V. Neale (as J. W.) suggest an increasing emphasis on co-operation as a provident mechanism for the accumulation of savings. His concern for this aspect of the movement underpinned his activity on the central relief committee during the Lancashire cotton famine, which provided the impetus for his most substantial work, <span class="italic">The Facts of the Cotton Famine</span> (1866). It was also manifested in his tireless support for the Provident Dispensaries movement, which he launched in Manchester in the early 1870s, serving as president from 1878.<br>
<br>Watts never entirely overcame suspicion of his &#145;socialist&#146; past, but by dint of what George Jacob Holyoake called his &#145;Manchester mind, clear, sagacious, persistent, progressive, with a passion for facts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, 19 Feb 1887), his calm, reasoned, metallic, platform style, and his capacity for administrative work, he imposed himself on the development of mid-Victorian Manchester, and of universal national education. He died at his home, The Sycamores, Seymour Grove, Old Trafford, Manchester, on 7 February 1887 after an extended illness, and was buried in the parish church of Bowdon.<br>
