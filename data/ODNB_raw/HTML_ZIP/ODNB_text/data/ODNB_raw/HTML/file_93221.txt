<span class="headword">Kinkel <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mockel]</span>,  Johanna</span>  (1810&#150;1858), <span class="occ">music teacher and exile</span>, was born at 13 Josephstrasse, Bonn, on 8 July 1810. Her father, a schoolmaster, encouraged her musical talent; she was taught piano by Beethoven's instructor, Franz Anton Ries. In 1832 Johanna married a music publisher, Johann Paul Mathieux, whom she left after a few months. She later wrote that her first marriage was &#145;the story of thousands of my sisters, and the inevitable consequence of our social conditions&#146;  (Br&ouml;cker, 40). While living in Berlin, from 1836 to 1839, Johanna met Mendelssohn and several literary celebrities. She returned to Bonn to teach music and to secure her divorce, which was granted in 1840. On 22 May 1843 she married (Johann) Gottfried Kinkel (1815&#150;1882), a professor of art history at the University of Bonn. Together they embraced the democratic politics which led to the revolutions of 1848 throughout Europe. Kinkel fought (alongside Friedrich Engels) against Prussian troops in the Baden uprising of June 1849; he was captured and sentenced to life imprisonment at the fortress of Spandau.<br>
<br>Johanna petitioned ceaselessly for her husband's release, orchestrating accounts in newspapers of the talented young professor doomed to spin wool in a cell while his wife and four young children were left unsupported. Kinkel's plight became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> in Germany. After his adventurous escape from Spandau in November 1850, aided by a devoted student, Carl Schurz (later a leading national politician in the United States), Kinkel settled in London with Johanna and the children. Thanks to his fame in Germany and Johanna's connections with the Berlin literati, the story of Kinkel's incarceration had been told in English newspapers too, including Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span>.<br>
<br>The Kinkels settled in St John's Wood. They found ready support among leading liberals, including the MPs Richard Monckton Milnes, Thomas Milner Gibson, and Richard Cobden, the radical historian of Greece George Grote, and his formidable wife, Harriet, who shared Johanna's passion for music. With these introductions to English society, both Kinkels found enough pupils to make a living. Though Johanna noted wryly of the many European exiles in London that they were &#145;a whole colony of teachers seeking pupils&#146;  (Leppla, 41), the couple's celebrity, combined with their willingness to work hard and become integrated into the host society, ensured their success.<br>
<br>Kinkel's fame as a revolutionary made him a magnet for large numbers of impecunious German exiles arriving in Britain in the aftermath of the failed revolutions of 1848. In lively letters to friends in Germany, and in her marvellously detailed semi-autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">Hans Ibeles in London: ein Familienbild aus dem Fl&uuml;chtlingsleben</span> (&#145;Hans Ibeles in London: a portrait of family life in exile&#146;, 1860), Johanna complained bitterly but often wittily about her fellow exiles, who idled and dreamed their lives away, begging and borrowing from the Kinkels, all the while showing open contempt for their benefactors' &#145;bourgeois&#146; way of life. She described the &#145;clubs&#146; of refugees still &#145;sitting around here, not mixing at all with the English, but just carrying on among themselves the squabbles&#146; of 1848 and complaining of life in England. For her part Johanna, though aware of certain religious prejudices (she had to be careful about expressing her lack of religious faith), appreciated the freedom from harrassment by the police, and the &#145;live and let live&#146; philosophy of the British  (Leppla, 51).<br>
<br>The Kinkels attracted the scorn of Karl Marx, also a charismatic leader among the German refugees. Kinkel's sentimental speeches at his trial, the romantic press coverage of his imprisonment and escape, and his personal vanity were targets for Marx's satire in his essay &#145;The great men of the exile&#146; (1852). Kinkel at the spinning-wheel in prison is &#145;our captive passion-flower&#146;; Johanna is a &#145;shrew&#146;, boasting to correspondents in Germany about being &#145;a sort of mother to all emigrants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Works</span>, 11.254&#150;5, 40.359). The Russian exile Alexander Herzen, though friendly towards the Kinkels, portrayed them as a comic larger-than-life couple. Johanna's &#145;perpetual, inexorable solicitude&#146; about her husband and her jealousy of his attractiveness to the women and girls he taught &#145;persecuted&#146; Kinkel, he noted. &#145;In return&#146;, he added, she &#145;supported him in his idea that he was a genius&#146;  (Herzen, 3.1159).<br>
<br>Johanna's hard work, anxiety, and jealousy contributed towards severe depression; she also had a heart condition. On 10 November 1858 Kinkel's diary records the completion of <span class="italic">Hans Ibeles</span>; five days later, on 15 November 1858, the entry reads: &#145;At twelve minutes past two the horror happened&#146;  (Ashton, 199). Johanna had either thrown herself out of an upstairs window 48 feet from the ground, at their home, 6 Eastbourne Terrace, Paddington, or fallen out while suffering from a dizzy spell. The coroner's verdict was accidental death, though friends and enemies alike suspected suicide while in a depressed state. Johanna was buried in Woking cemetery on 20 November  (Gottfried Kinkel's diary, Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Bonn). Although Johanna had felt guilty about portraying friends and family too obviously in her novel, Kinkel published it in Stuttgart in 1860. Some of her compositions were published in song collections in Britain, Germany, and America in the later years of the nineteenth century. One song, &#145;The Soldier's Farewell&#146; (&#145;Ritters Abschied&#146;), was reprinted several times. Her novel and letters show her to have been a spirited and talented woman, able to paint colourful verbal portraits of London life in the 1850s as lived by both the English middle class and the restless group of European exiles who made their homes there.<br>
