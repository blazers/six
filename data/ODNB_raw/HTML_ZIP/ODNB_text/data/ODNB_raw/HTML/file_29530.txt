<span class="headword">Williams,  Montagu Stephen</span>  (1835&#150;1892), <span class="occ">barrister and magistrate</span>, was born at his great-uncle's house, at Freshford, Somerset, on 30 September 1835. His grandfather was a barrister on the western circuit, and his father, John Jeffries Williams, a barrister on the Oxford circuit. He was educated at Eton College, but failed to gain a scholarship at Cambridge and at the age of twenty became for a short time a classical master at Ipswich grammar school. During the Crimean War he decided to enter the army. His father's friend Colonel Sibthorp gave him a commission in the South Lincoln militia, and on 14 March 1856 he obtained an ensigncy in the 41st foot. The conclusion of peace made military service less attractive to him, and when the regiment was ordered to the West Indies he resigned. For a time he was a member of a touring company and acted at Edinburgh, Belfast, Sunderland, and Nottingham. At Edinburgh he became acquainted with Louisa Mary Keeley (<i>d</i>. 1877), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15241/', "Robert Keeley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15240/', "Mary Anne Keeley")</script>, well-known actors. He married her in 1858. Partly on his wife's advice, partly on that of Montagu Chambers QC, his godfather, he then decided to go to the bar and entered the Middle Temple on 9 June 1859. Meantime he wrote for the press, had a share in a magazine called the <span class="italic">Drawing Room</span>, contributed to <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, and was author and adapter of several plays and farces, usually in collaboration with F. C. Burnand. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 30 April 1862, and joined the Old Bailey sessions and the home circuit.<br>
<br>Williams took naturally to criminal work and swiftly gained a large practice, especially as a defender of prisoners (indeed it was said that he defended more criminals than any other counsel). For fifteen years he was engaged in most of the sensational criminal cases in London and in 1879 was appointed junior prosecuting counsel to the Treasury. In 1884 he developed a throat disorder which in 1886 required an operation on the larynx. Its success was complete, although his voice was almost destroyed. A short attempt to return to practice at the bar proved to Williams that he must retire. He was then appointed a metropolitan stipendiary magistrate in December 1886, and sat successively at Greenwich, Wandsworth, and Worship Street. He was made a queen's counsel in 1888. He was active in charity, and was said to have been known among the poor as &#145;the poor man's magistrate&#146;. He published two autobiographical and anecdotal works, as well as <span class="italic">Round London</span> (1892), which described the condition of the poor in the east and west of London. He died at his house, 3 Chartham Terrace, Ramsgate, on 23 December 1892, and was buried at Brompton cemetery. He was well-known in society and in his profession and very popular.<br>
