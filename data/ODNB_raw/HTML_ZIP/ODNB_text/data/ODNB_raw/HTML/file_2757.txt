<span class="headword">Bodley, Sir  Josias</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1617), <span class="occ">soldier and military engineer</span>, was born in Exeter, the fifth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53707/', "John Bodley (c.1520&#150;1591)")</script>, merchant and later publisher, and his wife, Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hone (<i>d</i>. 1586). His brothers included the more celebrated <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2759/', "Sir Thomas Bodley (1545&#150;1613)")</script>, founder of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2758/', "Laurence Bodley (1547/8&#150;1615)")</script>, Church of England clergyman. During the Marian persecution the family fled to Wesel and Geneva, where Josias received his early education and may have been influenced by such renowned teachers as Calvin and Beza, and certainly by Drusius who corresponded with him and his brothers. After his return to England he studied, but briefly, at Merton College, Oxford. For a long interval he remains obscure. He seems to have been employed in commerce in Danzig, Poland, where the English ambassador noticed him as the son of John Bodley in 1581  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 15.582). Later, in his &#145;Journey to Lecale&#146;, he wrote about Polish and Irish drinking habits which he participated in and closely observed.<br>
<br>Bodley chose the soldier's life and by 1615 he could boast of having had three apprenticeships in the army, all of which included continental service. Of his early military career little is known, but he was with Leicester's expeditionary forces in the Netherlands at Leiden in 1586. When Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, was in the ascendant with his victory at the Yellow Ford in August 1598, Bodley was one of the captains sent with a large force under Sir Samuel Bagenal from the Netherlands to Ireland. Apart from desultory visits to England he spent the remainder of his life and busy career there as soldier, engineer, surveyor, and map maker. He was first stationed at Newry and later at Mountnorris, the new fort erected by Mountjoy in his strategy of encircling Ulster with garrisons and forts; but Bodley was also active with Mountjoy's mobile field army in 1601&#150;2. He won Mountjoy's praise for bravery in skirmishes at Carlingford and particularly for his imaginative attack with Captain Edward Blaney on the island fortress of Loghrorcan near Newry on 6 April 1601 when he had arrows tipped with wildfire shot into the fort, which the defendants deserted leaving much pillage of cattle, sheep, and stores to Bodley's men. At the Spanish landfall at Kinsale on 2 October 1601, Bodley's company moved south to join Mountjoy and Carew. He is much mentioned in the whole Kinsale campaign of both siege and battle there and especially, as trenchmaster-general, in advising Mountjoy on trench plans, and as chief engineer in the erection of siege forts at a stipend of 10<i>s</i>. per diem. After Kinsale, Bodley was at the neighbouring sieges of Baltimore, Berehaven, and Castlehaven, co. Cork. In January 1602 he travelled to England with a strong recommendation from Mountjoy to the privy council to support his undisclosed ambitions. It is likely that on that visit he donated a quadrant, an astronomical sphere, and other brass instruments, all signs of his mathematical and engineering skills, to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He is favourably mentioned in the queen's letter to Mountjoy and the Dublin council of 17 June 1602 on the question of what places to fortify in Ireland.<br>
<br>On his return to Ireland, Bodley was briefly governor of an Armagh garrison, probably Mountnorris in Ulster, but the following year he was transferred to work on the fortifications at Waterford, where Sir Richard Moryson was governor. Bodley was knighted by Mountjoy on 25 March 1604 and from then until 1606 he held the command of the nearby fort of Duncannon. In these years he was also engaged in coastal fortifications in Munster especially at Cork and in Limerick where his engineering skills were much in demand. The Dutch engineer Levan de Rosa and Sir Arthur Chichester, the future lord deputy and driving force in the Ulster plantation, worked with Bodley in selecting sites, drawing up plans which he presented to King James on his next visit to England. He returned with orders to build St Patrick's Fort at Waterford and another at Cork, and he appears to have had a hand in the building of Mountjoy Fort in Ulster, but all on condition of resigning his post at Duncannon and relinquishing his band of foot soldiers for which he gained a pension. In April 1606 Bodley was again in London promoting his own interests and to get arrears of pay. Sir Arthur Chichester urgently wanted him back in Ireland to complete his work on fortifications. In 1607 Bodley was appointed superintendent of castles in Ireland at 20<i>s</i>. per diem and by the end of that year he was the agent of the English privy council to oversee the forts at Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Kinsale; it was not a patented post but paid out of the annual Irish establishment list which caused him to run into large debts. His reports of his inspections of fortifications accompanied by Levan de Rosa, by another Dutch engineer, Joyes Everard, and by Sir Henry Danvers, the president of Munster, show him travelling over 700 miles by December 1608. For the improvements to such important forts as Elizabeth Fort, Cork, and St Augustine's, Galway, and to Limerick Castle, Bodley was paid about &pound;6700 in the years 1607 to 1609.<br>
<br>Not much is known of Bodley's further activities until his involvement with surveying for the Ulster plantations, except that Sir Francis Bacon in writing his &#145;Certain considerations touching plantation in Ireland&#146; in the summer of 1608 mentioned that a Mr Jones (was it Inigo?) wished to introduce Sir Josias Bodley to him. It is most likely that Bacon had seen Bodley's reports and may have wanted his advice on forts in the plantations. Part of his professional duties was the surveying of land and in 1609 he helped William Parsons, surveyor-general, survey the six escheated counties of Ulster&#151;Tyrone, Armagh, Coleraine, Fermanagh, Cavan, and Donegal&#151;but he took full honours for himself and his assistants in the production of a coloured set of maps within sixty-seven days. In 1611 he petitioned for &#145;some competent allowance during the few days that he has to live&#146; but in the same breath offered to survey all the fortifications in Ireland  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1611&#150;14</i>, 154&#150;5). In 1612 he covered Ulster again with the help of John Ball, making a survey of the progress of the new plantations which apparently so pleased King James that in January 1613 Bodley finally got a patent to be director-general and overseer of the fortifications and buildings in Ireland, for life and at his former salary. In March 1613 he attended the funeral of his brother Sir Thomas, who left him &pound;100, leaseholds in London, and a release from debts due to loans. Sir Josias was still in London in November 1613 when Sir Arthur Chichester asked him to report to the privy council on sites and plans for defence works left incomplete at Cork and Waterford. Maybe because Cecil held the patronage of conferring patents of forfeited Ulster lands, Bodley failed in his application to get a grant on account of the family's friendship with the earl of Essex: he complained bitterly of this not only to Michael Hicks, Cecil's secretary, but, more successfully, to Sir Ralph Winwood (the secretary of state, who married his brother Thomas's stepdaughter), for the latter ordered that arrears of his allowance be paid. Under Chichester's direction Bodley surveyed the plantations of the London Companies in Londonderry; once again he presented his report to the king who was angered at the defects found in the non-fulfilment of the plantations' conditions and, while thanking Bodley, wanted him to extend his investigations into other Ulster plantations in 1616. In the last year of his service in Ireland he surveyed 16,500 acres in co. Wexford for a new plantation there using the improved technique of the surveyor's chain. He was succeeded in his office of director-general of fortifications by the joint appointment of Sir Nicholas Pynnar and Sir Thomas Rotheram.<br>
<br>Apart from his reports, letters, surveys, and maps Sir Josias Bodley wrote a light-hearted description in colloquial Latin of his journey to and a party at Lecale in co. Down in 1602, in which he extols the delights of hard drinking and the taking of tobacco. (One of several transcripts is published by Falkiner, 1904.) He has perhaps been underestimated as a military engineer and surveyor at a time when military geography was institutionalized in Ireland by the creation of the office of overseer of fortifications, the responsibilities of which he fulfilled with little profit to himself. Bodley was unmarried and died intestate on 22 August 1617, probably in Dublin. He was buried on 26 August in Christ Church, Dublin, where he has a memorial tablet.<br>
