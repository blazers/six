<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott,  Mackay Hugh Baillie</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Beard's Hill, St Peter's, Broadstairs, Kent, on 23 October 1865, the first of the fourteen children of Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott, a Scot whose considerable wealth seems to have come mainly from sheep farms in Australia, and his wife, Martha Waters, who was English. While he was a child his family moved to Worthing in Sussex, where he went to school. From 1883 to 1885 he attended the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, with a view to managing his family's property in Australia. But shortly before he was due to leave for Australia Scott decided to become an architect, and from 1886 to 1889 he was articled to C. E. Davis of Bath. On 16 February 1889 he married Florence Kate Nash (1862&#150;1939). They went to the Isle of Man for their honeymoon, and then settled there, in Douglas, where Scott got a job with a surveyor. A daughter was born in 1889 and a son in 1891, and in 1892&#150;3 Scott built a house for his family in Douglas. He set up in practice there on his own and continued to work there until 1901. The Isle of Man probably did not offer great prospects to an architect of Scott's abilities, but he quite soon found a way of furthering his career without leaving the island.<br>
<br>In January 1895 Scott published an article entitled &#145;An ideal suburban house&#146; in <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, the leading progressive art magazine of the day. It was followed by several others on the design of middle-class houses. He wrote about homeliness, the quality he saw in old cottages and farmhouses; about simplicity and the clearing away of genteel clutter; and about the fireplace as the focus of family life. His most radical idea was the &#145;houseplace&#146;, a single large room in middle-class houses, with alcoves off it for eating, reading, talking, and so on, instead of the several small rooms of middle-class propriety. He wrote in an easy, middlebrow way and the illustrations, from his own designs, showed gleaming hearths, timber-framed inglenooks, and ornament drawn from nature and romance: the home as refuge. In the articles he published between 1895 and about 1900 Scott found his subject matter and his way of operating professionally.<br>
<br>For the articles are interwoven with the development of Scott's early houses on the mainland. Bexton Croft at Knutsford, Cheshire (1895&#150;6), was published as &#145;An ideal suburban house&#146;, the subject of his first article, while Seven Gables, Cambridge (1897&#150;8), appeared as &#145;A small country house&#146; in <span class="italic">The Studio</span> for December 1897. Others, such as Blackwell, Windermere (1898&#150;1900), and the White House, Helensburgh, near Glasgow (1899&#150;1900), were more loosely related to the articles, but had the timber-framed, double-height halls, generous inglenooks, and rich natural ornament which clients had seen illustrated there. At Blackwell much of Scott's decoration in plaster, metal, wood, textiles, and glass survives, showing his unusual judgement in the combination of colours, the geometry which disciplines and invigorates his natural ornament, and the interplay of plain and decorated elements. The furniture he designed from the mid-1890s, much of it made by the firm of John P. White in Bedford, has these qualities: simple, sturdy pieces with plank-like members against which are set panels of concentrated natural ornament, painted or inlaid. With these houses and this furniture Scott's work reached its early maturity.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Studio</span> was widely read in Europe and America. Early in 1897 Scott was asked to decorate and furnish two rooms in the Neues Palais at Darmstadt, Germany, for the grand duke of Hesse and by Rhine, a grandson of Queen Victoria. This was followed, later in 1897, by tiny, fantasy-laden interiors in a tree house on the royal estates for Princess Marie of Romania, the grand duke's sister: Scott devised a decorative symbolism of sunflowers for the sitting-room, poppies for the bedroom, and lilies for the oratory. His 1901 competition design for a country house for a connoisseur, sponsored by the German magazine <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Innendekoration</span>, won second prize when no first was awarded, principally because of his interiors, which glowed with ornament and hangings in pinks and blues and greens. Over the next decade Scott designed (and in most cases built) about a dozen houses and interiors in Europe and the United States, of which Landhaus Waldb&uuml;hl at Uzwil in Switzerland (1907&#150;11) was probably the most elaborate. It survives with its full complement of furniture and interiors. Probably no British architect working in the domestic field was better known in Europe before the First World War than Scott.<br>
<br>In 1901 Scott moved to Bedford, and converted two early nineteenth-century cottages just outside the town into a house for his family and an office. By now he had a considerable reputation, but he did not go to London, and chose not to move in architectural circles. He was an important figure within the arts and crafts movement, but he never became a member of the Art-Workers' Guild, its principal London organization. He was a modest-looking moustachioed figure, gentle and often droll, but little is known about him as a man, because of the lack of documentary evidence. An assistant's recollections of his office at this time give a glimpse of him:<blockquote>a long, low cottage, pink washed, with a mossy tiled roof &hellip; At the rear facing an acre of orchard, projected at one end, Scott's office (originally the detached washhouse), smothered in ivy; at the other end a wooden wing housed the staff &hellip; Red turkey twill curtains hung at the windows, and the brick floor had strips of brightly coloured matting &hellip; Two or three times a day, Scott would stroll across slowly from his room to ours, generally with a cat in his arms. (Kornwolf, 250&#150;51)</blockquote>All the time he was keeping the architectural papers supplied with illustrations of his work, maintaining that combination of journalism and remoteness which he had discovered on the Isle of Man. In 1906 he published a book, <span class="italic">Houses and Gardens</span>, a detailed account of his ideas on house design and a fetchingly illustrated survey of his work. It seems to have brought him many clients.<br>
<br>Scott's houses in these years have strong, defining roofs, a clear disposition of parts, and a feeling for the texture of brick, stone, wood, and plaster. Of the groups of smaller houses he built in the new garden suburbs, those on the south-east corner of Meadway and Hampstead Way in Hampstead Garden Suburb (1908&#150;9), or 36&#150;38 Reed Pond Walk, Gidea Park, Essex (1910&#150;11), are good and accessible examples. From about 1903 onwards he would often design a garden for a new house, laying it out as a series of compact outdoor rooms, along axes that run through the house as well. His interiors in these years generally took their cue from the forms and finishes of the exterior, and thus are plainer, more traditional, than those of the 1890s. The techniques and materials of English vernacular building were, increasingly, Scott's benchmark in design. Here was a language in which he could express his enduring ideal of homeliness without recourse to the extravagance of symbolism and elaborate decoration, a way of building that was ordinary and to hand. He worked in this way for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In March 1911 Scott's house and office were almost completely destroyed by fire. For some years he wandered with his wife and family from place to place, running the office as best he could until he closed it down in 1914. The Scotts did not have a permanent home until 1921, when he bought Ockhams at Edenbridge, a Kentish farmhouse which he repaired and lived in for the next twenty-one years.<br>
<br>In 1919 he opened an office in partnership with A. E. Beresford, who had worked for him since 1905 and took care of the business side of the practice. Their office was in Holborn, so Scott was working in London for the first time. But he resisted its pressures. Beresford was always in the office punctually, Scott was often late. Sometimes he did not come in at all, but preferred to work among the fields of Kent. They took up where he had left off in 1914 (though commissions no longer came from Europe), and in the 1920s their output equalled that of the pre-war years. Their houses were mostly neo-Tudor in style, some in a free neo-Georgian, and all handled with the reverence for traditional building which Scott had absorbed in the Bedford years. Old ways of working were cultivated, old materials were reused; tiles were brought to the site with the lichen still on them. These houses have not been studied as closely as Scott's earlier work because they seem so traditional. But Diane Haigh's study of Church Rate Corner, a modest house in Cambridge of 1924, shows Scott's traditionalism as spare, refined and intelligent, a sensibility honed down to the pleasure of materials and the good sense of using familiar methods for familiar purposes.<br>
<br>From about 1935 Scott began to play less part in the practice. He was then aged seventy and near the end of a long and remarkably focused career. He had put up several hundred buildings, over almost fifty years. He had re-established his career after the First World War, which left many of his contemporaries adrift. The great majority of his buildings were detached, middle-class houses, and his whole career had been bound up with a building type typical of his time, the single family house within commuting distance of a city. Throughout his work he had concentrated on the expression of domesticity, and the criticism sometimes made, that his houses are sentimental, perhaps arises from this: they say &#145;Home sweet home&#146; so sweetly. Scott, whose intellectual blandness was his strength, would have turned this criticism round, by pointing, as he did in all his writings, to the importance of feelings in the experience of houses. But one should also say that the reputation of his best work rests on other qualities besides, on skilful planning, and a handling of masses that is, remarkably, most effective in his smallest buildings.<br>
<br>Commuting, which combines participation in the city with emotional distance from it, is perhaps a good image for the whole strategy of Scott's career, for the consistency with which he kept personally aloof from the metropolitan centre of architecture while keeping his work always in the professional press. Between the wars he became a commuter himself. But when John Betjeman, who got to know him at this time, went to visit him at Edenbridge, he seemed like an &#145;unassuming countryman&#146;, not like an architect at all  (Betjeman, &#145;Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott&#146;, 78).<br>
<br>In 1939 Scott's wife died. His partnership with Beresford came to a formal end with the outbreak of war. In 1942 he sold Ockhams. He was by now an invalid, looked after by a permanent nurse, and spent the next two years in nursing homes or rented cottages in Devon and Cornwall. He died on 10 February 1945 in Brighton Municipal Hospital, and was buried at Edenbridge.<br>
