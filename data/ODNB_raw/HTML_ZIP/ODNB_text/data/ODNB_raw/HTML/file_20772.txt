<span class="headword">&Oacute; N&eacute;ill,  &Eacute;inr&iacute;</span> <span class="st"> [Henry O'Neill]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1489), <span class="occ">king or lord of T&iacute;r Eoghain</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20782/', "Eoghan &#211; N&#233;ill (d. 1456)")</script>, chief of T&iacute;r Eoghain, and of his wife, Caitr&iacute;ona (<i>d</i>. 1427), daughter of Ardghal Mac Mathghamhna. Since Eoghan was ransomed in 1422 from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye by his own wife and sons, &Eacute;inr&iacute; and his next brother, Aodh of the Fews, were probably born not long after <i>c</i>.1400. In 1431 &Eacute;inr&iacute; was briefly captured in a frontier conflict by Neachtain &Oacute; Domhnaill, brother of the king of T&iacute;r Conaill. In 1432 the hostility was renewed as a &#145;great war&#146; between the chiefs Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill (officially inaugurated in that year) and Neachtain's brother, Niall Garbh &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. 1439). &Eacute;inr&iacute; negotiated with &Oacute; Domhnaill's enemies, the &Oacute; Conchobhair chieftains of Sligo; then in 1433 he joined his father in invading Ulster east of the Bann, where &Oacute; Domhnaill had brought his army to ally with Robert Savage and MacQuillin, leaders of the vestigial Anglo-Irish colony there, who, like &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and &Oacute; Domhnaill themselves, were nominal subjects of Richard, duke of York, the absentee earl of Ulster.<br>
<br>With the aid of a fleet commanded by Mac Domhnaill, the Scottish lord of the Isles, &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and his father burnt the port of Ardglass and drove &Oacute; Domhnaill and MacQuillin into Louth, to seek the ineffective assistance of the chief governor of Ireland, who joined them in an unsuccessful raid on Armagh but could not prevent the submission of &Oacute; Domhnaill to &Oacute; N&eacute;ill before the end of the year. As the Anglo-Irish seem to have anticipated, this consolidation of authority in the north resulted in the invasion of Meath and Louth in 1434 by all the Ulster chiefs, during which campaign &Oacute; Domhnaill was captured, but &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and his brother Aodh distinguished themselves by covering the retreat of their troops after burning Nobber.<br>
<br>The annals credit the brothers with similar prowess at the camp-assault of the Rosses and the battle of Sl&iacute;ab Truim on Eoghan &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's expedition in 1435 against Neachtain &Oacute; Domhnaill, deputy leader of T&iacute;r Conaill, and his own hostile kinsman, Brian &Oacute;g (a grandson of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20771/', "&#201;inr&#237; &#211; N&#233;ill")</script> who died in 1392). When Brian &Oacute;g deserted Neachtain, coming in to parley under the safe conduct of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's court poet, &Eacute;inr&iacute; and his brothers violated the poet's guarantee by imprisoning and maiming Brian &Oacute;g and his two sons, one of whom died in consequence. The poet, having vigorously satirized &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's sons, was disinherited and exiled to Connacht for eighteen years, as he later lamented in an apologetic address to &Eacute;inr&iacute;, &#145;Cionnas do roichfinn r&iacute; Oiligh?&#146; (&#145;How shall I reach the king of Oileach?&#146;; Killiney, Franciscan House of Studies, MS A25, p. 149).<br>
<br>&Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill became increasingly prominent. In 1438 he intervened in Fermanagh to negotiate the release of the chief M&aacute;g Uidhir, imprisoned by rival kinsmen. Following his father's submission to the Dublin government in the spring of 1441, &Eacute;inr&iacute; brought an Anglo-Irish army to the borders of T&iacute;r Conaill in 1442 to assist Eoghan in subduing Neachtain &Oacute; Domhnaill, when he annexed the disputed borderland of Cine&aacute;l Mo&aacute;in and left a garrison in Neachtain's castle on the River Finn. He dominated T&iacute;r Conaill politically thereafter until his appointment of Aodh Ruadh &Oacute; Domhnaill (<i>d</i>. 1505) as chief in 1461.<br>
<br>The repeated attempts by &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and his father to force submission from &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye were less successful. In 1444 they ended in the surrender of nineteen hostages, including a son of &Eacute;inr&iacute;, to secure a safe retreat. However, &Eacute;inr&iacute;'s presence at Ardglass in company with the chiefs of the Ulster colonists on 9 December 1448 suggests an alliance with these, verified in 1450 when he aided MacQuillin to attack &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye. At Drogheda on 27 August 1449 &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, having full powers from his father, family, and subjects, ratified an indenture with the duke of York (as earl of Ulster and also king's lieutenant). He undertook, in exchange for the duke's aid and protection: to return any formerly conquered lands; to render the ancient services, including the &#145;bonnacht of Ulster&#146; (a former right of the earls of Ulster to billet fixed quotas of mercenary soldiers on each of the Ulster chiefs); to war against the duke's enemies; and to serve him whenever summoned with 500 men-at-arms and 500 foot soldiers. In May 1452 &Eacute;inr&iacute; brought about the death of Neachtain &Oacute; Domhnaill and married his widow, the daughter of MacWilliam Burke, lord of Mayo, although he was already married to Gormlaith (<i>d</i>. 1465), mother of his son &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute;g and daughter of Mac Murchadha Caomh&aacute;nach and of the sister of James Butler, fourth earl of Ormond. That July the dying Ormond brought an army northwards and forced &Eacute;inr&iacute; to dismiss &Oacute; Domhnaill's widow and take back Gormlaith, the earl's niece.<br>
<br>In 1455 &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was inaugurated chief in place of his father, Eoghan, in July and confirmed in office by Archbishop John Mey of Armagh on 4 August; he drew up a concordat with Mey on 14 November following. Styled in 1474 &#145;the king's friend&#146;, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill brought an Anglo-Irish army on an unsuccessful siege of his own brother Art's castle of Omagh in 1459, and in 1463 received a livery of scarlet and a golden chain from Edward IV, who, as the son of Richard duke of York, was now earl of Ulster. &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's expeditions to eastern Ulster in 1469, 1470, and 1476 in support of the White family and MacQuillin against the Savages and &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye, and his capture of Omagh after a six-month siege in 1470, mark a high point in his career. In 1480 his son and heir, Conn M&oacute;r (who married Eleanor, sister of Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare), received a grant of English law, the earl joining Conn that year in an unsuccessful siege of the castle at Caledon, stronghold of &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's brother, Se&aacute;n Buidhe. Besides family rivalry, &Oacute; N&eacute;ill was threatened by &Oacute; Domhnaill and &Oacute; N&eacute;ill of Clandeboye, who combined in 1481 to capture Conn. After ransoming Conn in 1483, &Eacute;inr&iacute; &Oacute; N&eacute;ill handed over the precarious chieftaincy to him, and eventually died on 15 June 1489.<br>
