<span class="headword">Killigrew <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cooke]</span>,  Katherine</span>  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1583), <span class="occ">gentlewoman and scholar</span>, was the fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke (1505/6&#150;1576)")</script>, Edward VI's tutor, of Gidea Hall in Essex, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1553), daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam, and widow of Sir John Hawes. Like her sisters Elizabeth, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/987/', "Anne Bacon")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46675/', "Mildred Cecil")</script>, Katherine was educated in the classics by her father. She became famous for her knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and for her ability to write poetry, although she left little evidence in writing. There is no confirmation of her skill in Hebrew. Katherine was left her choice of books in her father's will of 1575; two in Latin and one in Greek. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15533/', "Henry Killigrew of Cornwall (d. 1603)")</script> on 4 November 1565. Henry was often abroad on diplomatic missions, mainly in France and Scotland, and was knighted in 1591 for his services to his country. Katherine remained in England, using her family connections to the Cecils to make requests on behalf of her husband. She wrote verse in Latin to her sister Mildred, asking her to use her influence with her husband William Cecil to excuse Henry from overseas service. In 1582, shortly before her death, Katherine wrote to Cecil on her husband's behalf asking his aid in obtaining lands for him. Henry Killigrew's concern for his wife can be seen in his purchase of an annuity for her from the crown, and his attempts to return to England for the birth of their children.<br>
<br>Katherine Killigrew was a committed puritan, maintaining a friendship with the preacher Edward Dering; she offered him hospitality even when he was in disgrace with the queen. Some clues to her adult life can be learned from Dering's correspondence. Several letters dating from 1575, which he wrote to her at Hendon where she lived with her three daughters, Nan, Bess, and Mary, were printed in his <span class="italic">Godly Letters</span> (1614). A fourth daughter, Dorothy, is not mentioned in the Dering letters. Katherine suffered from frequent bouts of ill health. In his writing Dering refers to her physical sufferings, and offers her spiritual support and comfort while telling her of his own illness and his problems with his lungs; he died in 1576 of tuberculosis.<br>
<br>Katherine herself died on 27 December 1583 after having given birth to a stillborn child. She left her own epitaph, a verse mainly in Latin demonstrating her certainty of the resurrection. She was buried in the church of St Thomas the Apostle, London, which was burnt down in the 1666 great fire. Her memorial contained four inscriptions which were printed by Stow: one of these, in both Greek and Latin, was composed by her sister Elizabeth Russell. The verse laments the untimely loss of a virtuous sister, commending her wit, learning and grace, and it looks forward to their reunion in heaven. The three other tributes were written by well-known puritan divines, and commented on her learning, modesty, purity, and religious zeal. Camden also praised her knowledge of Greek and Latin in an epitaph.<br>
