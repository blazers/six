<span class="headword">Simon,  John</span>  (1675&#150;1751), <span class="occ">mezzotint engraver</span>, was born into a Huguenot family in Normandy and is said to have belonged to an artist family connected with the protestant church at Charenton, near Paris. After training in Paris as a line engraver he moved to England and rapidly adapted to the medium of mezzotint. His earliest prints were published from Cross Lane, Long Acre, during the middle years of Queen Anne's reign. Their spare and powerful style soon attracted the notice of Sir Godfrey Kneller, who about 1708&#150;9 had quarrelled with his principal engraver, John Smith, and in the period before the dispute was settled Simon obtained several of Kneller's commissions. This assured his reputation, and Simon became a founding subscriber to the Academy for Artists in Great Queen Street, set up under Kneller's patronage in 1711.<br>
<br>Simon was a prolific engraver, particularly noted for his portraits, of which Chaloner Smith (in <span class="italic">British Mezzotinto Portraits</span>) details 170 examples, above all after Kneller and Dahl, but also after Gibson, Murray, Mercier, and Seeman. His subjects represented all points of the political spectrum. Thus, while engraving three separate portraits each of the duke of Marlborough (nos. 93, 94, 96) and of Sir Robert Walpole (nos. 158&#150;60), he also engraved Jacobites, including Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester (no. 19), George Keith, the Earl Marischal (no. 92), Lord North and Grey (no. 112), and the duke of Ormond (no. 115). Simon's numerous portraits of members of the Hanoverian royal family were similarly balanced by portraits dating from <i>c</i>.1730 of the exiled Stuart king James III (no. 143), with Queen Clementina (no. 144) and the young princes Charles Edward (no. 145) and Henry Benedict (no. 146). Hardly surprisingly, these last were untitled and unsigned, but Chaloner Smith considered the attribution as &#145;certain&#146;  (p. 1118) on stylistic grounds. Simon also engraved a notable sequence of twenty-four <span class="italic">Poets and Philosophers of England</span>, published on six plates (<i>c</i>.1727), and many religious and decorative subjects, such as <span class="italic">Christ Restoring the Blind Man's Sight</span>, after Laguerre, <span class="italic">Four Elements</span>, after Amiconi, and <span class="italic">Four Seasons</span>, after Rosalba. Particularly notable was a version of the <span class="italic">Raphael Cartoons</span> at Hampton Court (no. 173), engraved in the early years of his career and published by Edward Cooper, for whom Simon worked extensively until <i>c</i>.1720. Thereafter he mostly published his own prints from a series of addresses in the vicinity of Covent Garden, including King Street (the Seven Stars), Villiers Street (the Golden Eagle), and New Street, before retiring from active engraving about 1742. He died in London on 22 September 1751, and his remaining stock of plates was sold in November 1761.<br>
