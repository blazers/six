<span class="headword">Cotta,  Alix  von</span>  (1842&#150;1931), <span class="occ">promoter of women's higher education</span>, was born in Brunswick, the eldest of three daughters of Carl Berhard von Cotta (1808&#150;1879) and Ilsabe Ida von Orges (1812&#150;1902). She grew up in Freiberg, Saxony, where her father was professor of geology at the internationally renowned mining academy there. Her mother was &#145;gifted and charming&#146; with a &#145;wide range of sympathies and interests&#146;  (Newnham College Roll, 50). Alix von Cotta was fluent in several languages, including English which she spoke with her sisters. In 1870 she began a lifelong correspondence with Penelope Lawrence, the founder of Roedean School. It is not known how von Cotta came to know Lawrence, but the latter is said to have been educated partly &#145;overseas&#146;. They both attended Newnham Hall, Cambridge, 1876&#150;8, von Cotta passing two groups in the higher local examinations, gaining distinctions in English literature and composition, French, German, and Italian, and a first class in Old English.<br>
<br>Bedford College, London, had been founded in 1849 as a non-denominational college for women. By 1878, when the college had an enrolment of 130, serious efforts were made to attract better-prepared students. To this end, a preparatory department was opened, and von Cotta invited to become its mistress of studies. Students studied Latin, French, English, and mathematics. She left after two years, returning to Germany, where she wrote journal articles mainly about the education and training of women.<br>
<br>Following mid-century debates about teacher training and the reform of the higher girls' schools in Germany, a number of institutions were opened to offer further education to young women. The most famous of these was the Victoria Lyceum in Berlin founded by an Englishwoman, Georgina Archer, with the active support and patronage of the Crown Princess Victoria. The Berlin scheme followed closely the model drawn up by the north of England Council for the Promotion of the Higher Education of Women by Anne Jemima Clough and Josephine Butler whereby lectures were given by university men to women above school age who wanted to continue their studies. Beginning in 1869, the scheme offered lectures on a variety of subjects but did not lead to any examination or qualification. As in England, demand was soon felt for more rigorous and structured instruction, followed by examinations suitable for women wanting to improve their teaching qualifications. Part-time courses began at the Victoria Lyceum in 1874 and attracted a small amount of support from the Prussian state. Crown Princess Victoria was particularly interested in the new women's colleges in England and, following the death of Georgina Archer, chose Alix von Cotta to head the lyceum in 1884 ahead of other candidates for the post, largely because she had studied at Newnham Hall.<br>
<br>Reformers wanting to gain admission for women to German universities made little headway at this time. Many women felt it was more important to compete with the overwhelming number of men who taught students in the upper grades of girls' public high schools. For this, women needed better access to better courses and university-level examinations. Such advanced courses were introduced by von Cotta at the Victoria Lyceum in 1888, first in history and German and later in English and French. Students sat a special examination supervised by the ministry of education. However, no courses in science subjects were offered since it was felt these should be left to male teachers. As late as 1905&#150;06, 1160 men held posts as teachers for the upper grades in Prussia's 207 public high schools for girls, while the corresponding number of women teachers was 221.<br>
<br>The Victoria Lyceum was the largest college training women for senior posts in girls' high schools in Prussia. Alix von Cotta remained its director for over twenty years and through her personal influence aroused &#145;intellectual interest among women, inspiring them with higher ideals and stimulating them to take an active part in public service&#146;  (Newnham College Roll, 51). She retired in 1911 and died in December 1931 in Hanover.<br>
