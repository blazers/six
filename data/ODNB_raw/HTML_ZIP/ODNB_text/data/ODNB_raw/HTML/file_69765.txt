<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bayly, Sir  Patrick Uniacke</span>  (1914&#150;1998), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 4 August 1914 at Bayly Farm, Nenagh, co. Tipperary, the second of three sons of Lancelot Francis Sanderson Bayly (1869&#150;1952), artist, and his wife and cousin, Eileen Maude Bayly (1886&#150;1961). He was educated at Aravon, Bray, co. Wicklow, and at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth (1928&#150;31). The family had an association with the navy dating back to Trafalgar, when Midshipman James Bayly was on board HMS <i>Euryalus</i>. Following his sub-lieutenants' courses and time in the cruiser <i>Amphion</i> and the sloop <i>Penzance</i>, Bayly was appointed first lieutenant in the river gunboat <i>Cicala</i>, joining her at Canton (Guangzhou) during a Japanese air raid on the city in 1938.<br>
<br>From November 1939 to July 1941, although he lacked the specialist qualification, Bayly was gunnery officer aboard the First World War cruiser <i>Durban</i>. Reports written on him in later years frequently mention his initiative, a quality apparent during his time in <i>Durban</i>. In Singapore during a refit Bayly learned to fly when some Gypsy Moth float-planes in a hangar set him thinking. The three D class cruisers, whose role was to patrol the 4000 miles between Colombo and Taiwan looking for enemy raiders, were hopelessly obsolete. Bayly's suggestion was to remove the midships turret and torpedo tubes and replace them with a Gypsy Moth and a crane, thus vastly increasing their range of observation. This novel and quite practical idea was not taken up.<br>
<br>Sent to Scotland to train beach landing parties in 1942, Bayly was flown to north Africa in June 1943 as an emergency replacement for a sick principal beachmaster. He was promoted acting lieutenant-commander and appointed commanding officer of M beach commando (as it was now called). His astute choice of beaches and coolness under fire gained him a DSC and bar in successive landings in Sicily and at Salerno. In the former, Bayly and his team brought the 51st division safely ashore in roughly half of the programmed time. At Salerno the opposition was much stiffer in the face of a well-camouflaged battery of the particularly effective 88 mm. guns. The landing proceeded on schedule.<br>
<br>Despite the decorations that Bayly won in the summer of 1942, it was perhaps his last such operation, the crossing of the River Volturno under fire that October, that gave him the most satisfaction. Summoned at about twelve hours' notice to prepare a landing for tanks at dawn, the team arrived at the river, which was in spate, with the assault phase in trouble: barely a company was across, instead of a battalion. The army refused them a boat, but they found one abandoned with a rent in the canvas bow. The hole was stuffed with clothing, and with the bow lifted clear of the water by positioning themselves and the equipment in the stern, they paddled across. Uncertain as to the state of the front, Bayly split his team, sending four along the bank while with the other three he swept downstream to the sea before paddling back close to the north shore. Just after they landed on the only suitable beach the other four arrived. Accompanied by a runner, Bayly returned to the brigade headquarters to report, after which he and his group crossed again to the beach. They were under fire both ways from multi-barrelled mortars. The tanks landed at dawn.<br>
<br>To his surprise Bayly had a virtually untroubled view of the D-day landings from the bridge of the cruiser <i>Mauritius</i>, to which he had been appointed first lieutenant in 1944. He left the <i>Mauritius</i> early in 1945 and, having married Third Officer Moira Gourlay (Moy) Jardine (<i>b</i>. 1922), of the WRNS, on 4 April, was delighted to be on the Royal Naval Staff College course at Greenwich. Another enjoyable period ashore followed, appropriately enough at the Staff College, Camberley, before Bayly's next appointment saw him in the Mediterranean as staff officer (operations) first in <i>Orion</i> and later in the modernized <i>Mauritius</i>, the flagships successively of the 1st cruiser squadron. Frequently involved in the anti-immigration patrols off Palestine, with others of the ship's company he often witnessed harrowing scenes, which he described at some length in an unpublished memoir.<br>
<br>Promoted commander, in mid-July 1948 Bayly joined the directorate of training and staff duties. His 68-page booklet <span class="italic">Notes on the Royal Navy</span> became the &#145;bible&#146; for the Joint Services Staff College. Other navies also sought it, and by 1954 some 17,000 copies had been printed. Bayly took command in November 1951 of the sloop <i>Alacrity</i>, and later of the destroyer <i>Constance</i>. Both saw action in the Korean War, from which he emerged with a second bar to his DSC, together with appointment to the American Legion of Merit.<br>
<br>On his promotion to captain in 1954 Bayly went to the joint planning staff in the newly created Ministry of Defence. During the Suez crisis of 1956 his paper &#145;The control of the Nile&#146; demonstrated the futility of a proposed scheme to influence Egyptian policy by controlling the headwaters of the river. To his surprise it was significant enough to be quoted by the prime minister. In the following year, after a truncated spell at the Imperial Defence College, he was appointed to command HMS <i>Cavendish</i> as captain (D), 6th destroyer squadron. This was followed by a more relaxed two years in the NATO headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, and an equally happy period as commodore, chief of staff, to the commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet.<br>
<br>Bayly then got what he said was the best job in the navy: that of flag officer, sea training, with the rank of rear-admiral. On the wall behind his desk was an appropriate quotation from Nelson's letter to St Vincent before the battle of Copenhagen: &#145;I am brushing these fellows up, they do not have that activity that my mind carries with it&#146;. He was appointed CB in 1965, and his next post was that of admiral president of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Bayly's last post, on promotion to vice-admiral, was in NATO as chief of staff to the commander of naval forces in southern Europe. Appointed KBE in 1968, he retired in 1970. Bayly was the director of the Maritime Trust from 1971 to 1988. He was a trustee of the British Korean Veterans' Association and patron of the Royal Naval Commando Association. For twelve years he was chairman of the governors of the girls' Royal Naval School at Haslemere.<br>
<br>Pat Bayly was a gentleman of the old school. Although invariably courteous, he was barely tolerant of fools or incompetents. He disclaimed any intellectual pretensions, but was an accomplished watercolourist and could dash off competent verse. He also researched at length the site of St Paul's shipwreck on Malta. His description in his unpublished memoir of the passage down the Volturno under fire, the four men lying back in the stern of the boat to lift its damaged bow clear of the water, &#145;floating down like the Lady of Shallot&#146;, was typical. He had no doubts about the role of luck in a successful career, one of his after-dinner speech topics being called, with typical humility, &#145;Right place, right time&#146;.<br>
<br>Sir Patrick Bayly died in Forest Brow residential home for the elderly, 63 Forest Road, Liss, Hampshire, on 1 May 1998, survived by his wife and two daughters. His ashes were buried at sea, off the Nab tower in the Solent, on 28 May 1998.<br>
