<span class="headword">Stalham,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1677), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Norfolk of unknown parents and was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1617 and whence he graduated BA in 1621 and proceeded MA in 1624. He married Ann Powell (<i>d</i>. 1682) of St Giles Cripplegate, London, on 2 August 1632 and their son John followed his father to Christ's in 1667. Stalham was ordained as a preacher in Norwich in 1626 and in May 1632 he was instituted as vicar at the parish of Terling in Essex.<br>
<br>Stalham succeeded the puritan Thomas Weld, who had been deprived of his living by William Laud, bishop of London, for his refusal to conform. Stalham inherited a parish in which the minister, his patrons the Mildmay family, and leading parishioners had co-operated to establish a godly community, notable for its level of moral reform and puritan zeal. After some initial wavering Stalham continued Weld's opposition to the ceremonialism of the Laudian church. As he acknowledged, he was spurred on to do so by his puritan parishioners, with whom he maintained close links and whom he acknowledged in his various published works. Together they made Terling a godly centre to which others were attracted from elsewhere in the county. As a result he and his parish were several times the subject of investigation by the church authorities, notably over their resistance to the railing in of the communion table. The political breakdown following the collapse of Charles I's personal rule in 1640 allowed Stalham and his parishioners to cast aside the prayer book, denounced as an idol by Stalham, and its ceremonies and to adopt an extemporary form of puritan worship. This led to his being one of the main offenders cited in an Essex petition drawn up in defence of the prayer book in 1641.<br>
<br>But Stalham went on to play a leading role, both in print and in person, in the religious events of the period. In 1654 he was appointed as preacher of the gospel in Edinburgh and spent some time away from his parish. In Essex Stalham found himself active in defending his vision of the church against the threat from pre-1640 anti-puritan ministers, as assistant in the 1650s to the Essex committee for scandalous ministers, from Baptists and Quakers, and, as signatory to a 1643 petition from Essex ministers against alehouses, from what he termed, &#145;the ignorant and profane multitude&#146;  (Stalham, &#145;Vindiciae redemptionis&#146;, sig. A2<i>v</i>). Ironically the greater religious freedoms of the 1640s and 1650s posed problems for Stalham, both in his own parish and more generally in the county. At Terling Stalham found sections of the parish attracted by the appeal of both Baptists in the 1640s and Quakers in the 1650s. In January 1644 he organized a debate at Terling with Baptist emissaries, who included the soapboiler Thomas Lambe, at which he played a leading part and of which he left a printed account (<span class="italic">The Summe of a Conference</span>), while in 1647 he printed a series of sermons he had preached against the evangelizing activities there of Samuel Oates, father of Titus (<span class="italic">Vindiciae redemptionis</span>). In the 1650s he was an active controversialist, both writing and preaching against the Quakers. The Quaker James Parnell singled out Stalham as playing a prominent role in his persecution in Essex in 1655.<br>
<br>As his printed works make clear Stalham was a strict Calvinist with a firm belief in limited election who attacked ideas of universal redemption. Described in 1650 as &#145;a godly and painefull minister [who] preacheth constantly&#146;  (Smith, 305), he ministered at Terling to an Independent congregation. After the Restoration, Stalham was deprived of his living, in October 1662, but he continued to live at Terling, by then one of the largest centres of nonconformity in the county, where he served a large congregational church. The commonly accepted date of 1681 for his death is probably wrong. A letter written in June 1677 referred to his recent death.<br>
