<span class="headword">Stephens,  Henry</span>  (1795&#150;1874), <span class="occ">writer on agriculture</span>, was born at Keerpoy, Bengal, on 25 July 1795, the son of Andrew Stephens, an East India Company surgeon, who died at Calcutta on 26 August 1806. He went to Scotland and was educated at parish and grammar schools in Dundee; at Dundee Academy, under the rector, Thomas Duncan, he also studied mathematics, natural philosophy, and chemistry, from 1809 to 1811. In 1812&#150;13 he attended lectures on chemistry and agriculture at the University of Edinburgh and in 1815 he boarded himself with George Brown of Whitsome Hill, &#145;one of the best farmers of that well-farmed county&#146;. In the preface to his <span class="italic">Book of the Farm</span> (1852), Stephens described how for two years there<blockquote>I laboured with my own hands at every species of work which the ploughman, the field-worker and the shepherd must perform in the field, or the steward and the cattle-man at the steading: and even in the dairy and poultry house.</blockquote>After a third year spent in managing the farm, he made an agricultural tour of Europe, gaining an insight into continental methods.<br>
<br>Shortly after his return home in 1820 Stephens took over the 300 acre run-down farm at Balmadies in the parish of Rescobie, Forfarshire, already probably in the possession of the family. He transformed the holding with new buildings and roads, thorn hedges, and stone dykes; he also enlarged and regularized the small fields which had been subject to flooding, and introduced the stall feeding of cattle and the folding of sheep in turnip-fields, with nets instead of hurdles. His use of furrow drains, filled with small stones, anticipated the Deanston plan of James Smith (1789&#150;1850). Stephens is said to have raised the value of the holding from &pound;150 to &pound;400 a year. Some of these improvements were described in his earliest articles on agriculture, written at Balmadies from January 1828 onwards, which appeared in the first volume of the new <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Agriculture</span>, in 1829. Stephens then made an agricultural tour of the north-east part of Ireland and described it in the third volume of this journal, in 1832, and he became its editor in the same year. He had been an ordinary member of the Highland and Agricultural Society since 1826; later he was a member of its council and he edited the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> until 1852.<br>
<br>By the early 1830s Stephens had been forced to relinquish Balmadies, having lost all his investments in the failure of an Indian company. He moved to the Edinburgh area where by 1837 he was settled at Redbraes Cottage, Bonnington Road, Edinburgh. He had decided perforce to devote his career to agricultural journalism, rather than practice, believing from his own experience that there was a great need of instructive literature for young farmers. A chance meeting with William Blackwood, the publisher of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal</span>, proved fortuitous, and his publishing house was to issue all Stephens's subsequent writings.<br>
<br>In the thirty years from 1842 Stephens, with the aid of illustrators and sometimes other collaborators such as James Slight, Robert Scott Burn, and William Seller, had ten titles published, of which the first and most influential was <span class="italic">The Book of the Farm</span> (editions in his own lifetime were printed in 1842&#150;4, 1849&#150;51, and 1871). This work rapidly became accepted as the standard work on practical agriculture. Its success was inspired by its logical arrangement, following the seasons of the farming year (unlike the alphabetical layout of dictionaries and encyclopaedias) and by the detail in which every operation and implement was described. It was illustrated with numerous high-quality engravings, including the remarkable silhouette drawings of Gourlay Steell. <span class="italic">The Book of the Farm</span> was still consulted at the end of the twentieth century as a source for Victorian farming, though it must be remembered that in its details it reflects the mixed farming practice of lowland Scotland. Like all Stephens's works it was extensively grounded not only on his own practical experience but on a wide reading of contemporary research in agricultural science.<br>
<br>With his collaborators Stephens went on to produce other titles in <span class="italic">The Book of the Farm</span> series, including <span class="italic">The Book of Farm Implements and Machines</span> (1858) and <span class="italic">The Book of Farm Buildings</span> (1867), and he wrote a summary version, <span class="italic">The Catechism of Practical Agriculture</span> (1855). Other studies included <span class="italic">A Manual of Practical Draining</span> (with editions in 1846&#150;8), <span class="italic">The Yester Deep Land Culture</span> (1855), and <span class="italic">Physiology at the Farm</span> (1867), which examined animal nutrition and food plants. A number of his works were translated into several European languages and <span class="italic">The Book of the Farm</span> appeared in several editions in the USA.<br>
<br>Stephens was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1843 and he became a corresponding member of a number of overseas agricultural societies (listed on the title page of <span class="italic">The Book of the Farm</span>, 3rd edn, 1871). He received gold medals from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and from Emperor Napoleon III at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855 where he was a judge. In his later years he made annual visits to the spa at Bad Homburg, Hesse, and to the vineyards of the Rhineland, where he investigated the techniques of cultivation. He remained unmarried, and died at Redbraes Cottage, Bonnington Road, on 5 July 1874, of pneumonia following accidental coal-gas poisoning, which may have aggravated an existing heart condition. He was buried at Rosebank cemetery, Leith, on 8 July.<br>
