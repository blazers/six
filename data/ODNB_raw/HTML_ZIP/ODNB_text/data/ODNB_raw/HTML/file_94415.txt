<span class="headword">Wilson,  Bryan Ronald</span>  (1926&#150;2004), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 25 June 1926 at 3 Proctor's Terrace, Leeds, the third son and fourth child of Alice Elizabeth Wilson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (1885&#150;1961), a clothing club collector. His father is unknown, but he took the surname of his mother's first husband and father of her other children, Jesse Wilson (1884&#150;1918). In 1933 his mother married her second husband, Harry Little. Educated at Meanwood Road elementary school (1931&#150;2) and Cowper Street elementary school (1932&#150;9), in Leeds, Wilson left school aged thirteen, spent a year working for an accountant, then worked as a junior at the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span> before being called up for military service in 1944. Demobilized in 1948, he studied at University College, Leicester, for the external University of London BSc in economics, and obtained a first-class honours degree in 1952. He continued his studies at the London School of Economics, where in 1955 he was awarded the Hutchinson medal for the best research of the year for his doctoral thesis, a study of Christadelphianism, Elim Pentecostalism, and Christian Science, later published as <span class="italic">Sects and Society</span> (1961).<br>
<br>After he had spent seven years as a lecturer in sociology at the University of Leeds, in 1962 the University of Oxford appointed Wilson a reader in sociology. The following year he became a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, which became his home for the next thirty years. A confirmed bachelor, he revelled in the life of an Oxford don, serving as sub-warden (1988&#150;90) and as domestic bursar (1989&#150;93) of his college, and taking considerable pride and pleasure in being steward of All Souls' well-stocked wine cellar. He also devised the visiting fellowship programme, which brought hundreds of scholars to Oxford. He did not, however, welcome the arrival of women, fearing that they might disrupt the scholarly ambience by discussing domestic trivialities.<br>
<br>Wilson was undoubtedly one of the most influential social scientists of his day. His theoretical insights were always supported by meticulous attention to empirical detail. Over a hundred publications (including eleven books and seven edited volumes) embraced such subjects as education, rationality, and moral responsibility, but the greater part of Wilson's work concerned the sociological aspects of religion. A staunch defender of the &#145;secularization thesis&#146;, Wilson set the stage for subsequent debates in his <span class="italic">Religion in Secular Society</span> (1966), methodically adducing evidence to demonstrate that Europe (at least) was undergoing &#145;a process whereby religious thinking, practice and institutions lose social significance&#146;  (p. 14). He also pointed out, however, that religion often continues in the private sphere, sometimes acquiring new forms of expression in tune with contemporary society. His elaboration of different types of nineteenth-century sects in <span class="italic">Religious Sects: a Sociological Study</span> (1970) and of African religions in <span class="italic">Magic and the Millennium</span> (1973) was followed by research into newer, twentieth-century religious movements. He was particularly fascinated by the Soka Gakkai Buddhists, whom he studied in Europe and Japan, but appointments as a visiting professor at universities in Australasia, Africa, North America, and Europe enabled him to study at first hand an exceptionally wide variety of religious groups and to draw upon them from a comparative perspective, as was evidenced in his <span class="italic">New Religious Movements in Contemporary Society</span> (1990).<br>
<br>An avowed agnostic, Wilson described his approach as one of &#145;sympathetic detachment&#146;. While employing studious objectivity as a social scientist, he courted controversy by defending the rights of minority religions, appearing as an expert witness and writing affidavits for groups such as Scientology, the Unification Church, and the Exclusive Brethren. The honours conferred on him included a doctorate from the Catholic University of Leuven in 1992. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1994. As its president from 1971 to 1975 Wilson played a crucial role in the development of the Conf&eacute;rence Internationale de Sociologie Religieuse (later the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale de Sociologie des Religions, or in English the International Society for the Sociology of Religion).<br>
<br>Wilson commanded the respect, admiration, and affection of his many students and colleagues around the world. Generous with his time, and always the perfect host, he had a delightful, sometimes mischievous sense of humour, and could occasionally display a rare talent for mimicry. He was, however, essentially a private person for whom correct protocol played an important role&#151;few ever saw him not wearing a suit and tie.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1993 Wilson moved to a flat in Headington. The onset of Parkinson's disease restricted, but did not entirely prevent, his writing the occasional article, travelling around the world for lectures, or sometimes a holiday. He continued to enjoy the company of his friends, especially when sharing a fine claret. His death from a heart attack on 9 October 2004 followed a good meal at the Jersey Arms, Middleton Stoney, after a day's drive in the Oxfordshire countryside; he was pronounced dead on arrival at the Horton General Hospital, Banbury. Prior to his cremation at the Oxford crematorium on 21 October his family, friends, and colleagues gathered from North America, Japan, and Europe to celebrate his life at a ceremony in All Souls chapel.<br>
