<span class="headword">Phillips,  Thomas</span>  (1708&#150;1774), <span class="occ">biographer and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Ickford, Buckinghamshire, on 5 July 1708. His father was a convert to Roman Catholism, in which he was himself brought up. At an early age he was sent to a protestant school, where he supplied the deficiency in religious teaching by studying the <span class="italic">Imitation of Christ</span>, the <span class="italic">Introduction to a Devout Life</span>, and the <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints</span>. His father soon sent him to the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer in France, where he carried off the prizes in all the schools. On completing his course of rhetoric, he entered the noviciate at Watten, near St Omer, on 7 September 1726, and he made the simple vows of the Society of Jesus on 8 September 1728. He then moved to the English College at Li&egrave;ge to study a triennial course of philosophy. Soon after his admission to holy orders his father died, leaving him a fortune which ensured his financial security. He travelled through the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Italy, visiting the universities, and forming many useful friendships.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1731, towards the end of the third year of his philosophical course, and while still retaining the resolution to abide in the Society of Jesus, Phillips made a voluntary renunciation of his actual and contingent property in favour of the college at Li&egrave;ge and of the provincial father, John Turberville. However, in July 1733, after being refused the opportunity to teach classical literature at St Omer, he withdrew from the society, though his affection for it suffered no diminution.<br>
<br>Phillips now moved to Rome, where Father Henry Sheldon, rector of the English College, introduced him to Charles Edward Stuart, Stuart claimant to the throne, who, on 1 September 1739, procured for him the appointment to a canonry at Tongres. After his return to England he officiated as chaplain to George, fourteenth earl of Shrewsbury; then to Sir Richard Acton at Aldenham, Shropshire; and subsequently (1763&#150;5) to Mr Berkeley of Spetchley Park, Worcestershire. Eventually he retired to Li&egrave;ge, where he was readmitted to the Society of Jesus on 16 June 1768.<br>
<br>Phillips's principal literary work was <span class="italic">The History of the Life of Cardinal Pole</span> (1764). His object in writing this biography was to provide, in English, an account of the Council of Trent from a Roman Catholic point of view. The work caused alarm among certain protestant readers and elicited many replies from Timothy Neve, John Jortin, and others. Phillips died at Li&egrave;ge in July 1774.<br>
