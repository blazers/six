<span class="headword">Neagu,  Paul</span>  (1938&#150;2004), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in Bucharest, Romania, on 22 February 1938, the second of six children of Tudor Neagu, a craftsman shoemaker originally from Moldovia, and his wife, Rosalie, who came from a peasant background in Transylvania. Both parents were Baptist converts from Greek Orthodox families. Neagu's father, who as both a small employer and nonconformist Christian was doubly suspect in post-war Communist Romania, was a powerful presence in young Neagu's life; his obdurate independence of spirit was inherited by his son, as was his moral seriousness and ceremonious dignity. In 1947 the family moved to a smallholding at Timisoara, where Neagu completed his schooling at sixteen, and learned something of his father's craft.<br>
<br>After leaving school Neagu was variously employed as an electrician, a railway cartographer, and a technical draughtsman before enrolling, at twenty-one, at the Nicolae Grigorescu Academy of Fine Art, Bucharest. This background in craft and technology can be traced in Neagu's enduring love of materials and in the intricacy and ingenuity of his design and workmanship as an artist&#150;draughtsman and sculptor. His Baptist background prevented him from securing a much-desired place to read philosophy at the University of Bucharest, in spite of assiduous preparation. His reading of approved philosophers and Marxist texts, together with avid clandestine studies in biblical exegesis, Eastern philosophy, and mysticism, laid the basis for the deeply metaphysical cast of mind that informed his artistic life's work.<br>
<br>Neagu specialized in painting at the academy, which placed a traditional emphasis on figurative realism, centred on continuous drawing from the figure, but also included rewarding studies of Romanian folk art and architecture. While researching in 1964 for his diploma presentation the following year, Neagu experienced an epiphany that remained central to his artistic life, a visionary apprehension of the great annual summer fair at Tirguil Gaina in central Romania, to which peasants from all points of the compass brought marriageable daughters and sons. The young Neagu envisaged this festive marriage market as a complex symbolic exchange of interconnecting affections and energies, a microcosmic image of the human universe, whose components, mineral, organic, corporeal, social, were aspects of a geometric cosmography. Henceforth his creative thinking, and the imagery it generated in his performances, drawings, sculpture, and painting, derived crucially from this human-centred cosmological vision.<br>
<br>After leaving the academy in 1965 Neagu married Sybilla Oarcea, an actor, and quickly established himself in Bucharest as a central figure in the officially unacknowledged Romanian avant-garde. During this period he created small cellular box-like objects, often with hinged doors and lids, little tabernacles made out of found and ephemeral materials (matchboxes, fragments of mirror, leather, wood, and so on). After use in semi-ritualistic installations and interactions, these &#145;palpable objects&#146; acquired the aura of quasi-sacred relics. In its performative and ritualizing aspects Neagu's work paralleled that of his older contemporary, the German Joseph Beuys. Much of his work of the late 1960s had an esoteric, ludic, and occasionally politically ironic, dimension.<br>
<br>In early 1969, after showing in mixed exhibitions in Europe, and in two one-person shows in Bucharest, Neagu was invited by Richard Demarco to exhibit at his Edinburgh gallery with other leading Romanian artists. He stayed on to exhibit at Demarco's Edinburgh Festival exhibition that summer, where he created a darkened environment filled with tactile objects. These were later developed into figurative forms whose honeycomb structures were analogues for the energetic inner-outer, solid-and-void unity of the human body. In 1970, in Bucharest and again in Edinburgh, Neagu presented architectonic symmetrical cellular figures, lifesize and larger. He also created edible figures whose energy &#145;cells&#146; were of gingerbread and waffle: for him art could involve intellect, emotion, and every bodily sense. Later collectively entitled <span class="roman">Anthropocosmos</span>, Neagu's figures, Vitruvian in inspiration, were influenced by the ideas of the French anthropological philosopher Gilbert Durand, who considered the human microcosm as a vital term of the social macrocosm, and vice versa. Neagu conceived the body as a cellular micro-structure related to progressively larger macro-structures, from the domestic house to the socio-political organism.<br>
<br>In 1971, having been divorced in the previous year, Neagu settled permanently in the United Kingdom, becoming a British subject in 1977. The 1970s and early 1980s were a period of furious and prolific creativity, during which he performed and exhibited widely, in the UK and abroad, and was recognized as an outstanding teacher, first at Hornsey College of Art, and later at the Slade School of Art. His performances were remarkable for their repertoire of energetic symbolic actions requiring sustained physical effort: stilt-walking, jumping, whirling, running at and up walls. In 1972 he invented the Generative Art Group (GAG), an imaginary international collective of artists and writers, whose whimsical purpose was to allow him diversity of style and action, and more prosaically (and successfully) to secure Arts Council patronage. Its climactic event&#151;and unmasking&#151;was a &#145;group exhibition&#146; at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1975. Neagu also had important performance-exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery (1973 and 1976) and at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (1979), when his public performances ended. He continued to exhibit until the end of his life.<br>
<br>At Oxford Neagu introduced a rectangular table with three legs, one extended outwards, configured as an isosceles triangle. This was the progenitor of his most characteristic sculptural form, the <span class="italic">Hyphen</span>, which featured in all his exhibitions thereafter, in many versions, created in diverse materials and dimensions. The <span class="italic">Hyphen</span>, signifying connectivity, and schematically combining the rectangle, the circle, and the triangle, can be seen as a symbolic image for a plough, a cross, a skull, a sled, an ark, an anchor, a cosmological ramp, a compass, or a fulcrum. A singularly original invention, it is a dynamically multivalent symbol as potent as Brancusi's <span class="italic">Endless Column</span>. In the mid-1980s Neagu elaborated this basic <i>alpha</i> in steel, adding arcs, flat plates, and incomplete stars in a concert of forms he entitled <span class="italic">Nine Catalytic Stations</span>.<br>
<br>Through the 1990s and after Neagu experimented with other materials and forms, including steel balls, animal hide, painted wood structures, and slatted wood forms. He continued to draw and project public works. After the fall of the Communist regime in Romania in 1989 he was able to take up dual citizenship, and, hailed in his native land as a major artist, he undertook two monumental public commissions, in Bucharest and Timisoara, and set up a studio. In his council flat in Holloway he lived and worked in the austere conditions of an ascetic. Afflicted by kidney disease in the late 1980s and by a stroke in 2002, his last years were shadowed by lack of recognition in his adopted country, and by poverty and illness borne stoically. In 1997 he married his second wife, Monica Omescu, but the marriage was short-lived, and ended in divorce in 2001. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>A handsome man of imperious intellect, Neagu remained in many respects a critically isolated figure in British art, his work animated by an idiosyncratic but entirely coherent metaphysical complex of thought, expressed in symbolic forms and actions. In this he belonged to an eastern European tradition, whose prime progenitors were Malevich and Brancusi, which conceives of the artist as a spiritual voyager and experimental philosopher. Within this great tradition he was without doubt a major international figure. He died on 16 June 2004 at the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, of lobar pneumonia.<br>
