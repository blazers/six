<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barlow, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1845&#150;1945), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Brantwood Fold, Edgworth, near Bolton, Lancashire, on 4 September 1845; he was the eldest of seven children of James Barlow (1821&#150;1887) of Greenthorne, Edgworth, who established the cotton mills of Barlow and Jones at Edgworth and Bolton, and his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of James Barnes, also of Edgworth. Barlow's early scientific interests led to thoughts of a medical career despite his father's wish that he join the family business. After four years at Owens College, Manchester, where he read natural sciences, Barlow graduated BSc (London) in 1867. There was, however, no good clinical training available in Manchester at that time, and the following year he entered University College, London, as a medical student. Having qualified in 1870 he was appointed house physician to Sir William Jenner at University College Hospital. Jenner's rigorous clinical method, particularly regarding post-mortem examination, was an important influence on Barlow's development as a clinician and medical researcher. He passed his second MB and BS in 1873, both with first-class honours, and was awarded his MD the following year.<br>
<br>In 1874 Barlow was appointed medical registrar at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, and was elected assistant physician the following year. In 1885 he was promoted full physician, from which position he retired in 1899. He was also, successively, assistant physician at Charing Cross Hospital (1875&#150;7) and of the London Hospital (1877&#150;80) before returning to University College Hospital in 1880 as assistant physician; there he served as full physician from 1885 until his retirement in 1910, when he became consulting physician. He held the Holme chair of clinical medicine from 1895 to 1907. He was also, from 1884 to 1888, on the staff of the London Fever Hospital.<br>
<br>On 30 December 1880 Barlow married Ada Helen (1843&#150;1928), daughter of Patrick Dalmahoy, writer to the signet, of Edinburgh. She was a former ward sister at the Great Ormond Street Hospital; they had three sons and two daughters, the younger of whom died in infancy. The eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30594/', "Sir (James) Alan Noel Barlow (1881&#150;1968)")</script>; the second was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30596/', "Sir Thomas Dalmahoy Barlow (1883&#150;1964)")</script>; and the third, Patrick Basil (1884&#150;1917), died on the western front during the First World War.<br>
<br>Barlow is best known for his original researches on scurvy in infants and young children. Although the disease in infants had been described by Francis Glisson in the seventeenth century, its subsequent decline in Britain led to some confusion among clinicians confronted by an increasing number of cases of rickets in the second half of the nineteenth century. The increase was associated with the adoption of artificial infant feeds, especially among the middle classes. Until Barlow's research was published the pseudo-scorbutic symptoms in such cases were generally viewed as conditions of acute rickets. Barlow's isolation of scurvy from rickets as a definite and separate disease&#151;although often concomitant in the same child&#151;was a triumph of deductive reasoning; outside the British Isles infantile scurvy is still commonly termed Barlow's disease. In March 1883 Barlow published his first findings on infantile scurvy, and its post-mortem appearances in three fatal cases, in a paper entitled &#145;On cases described as &#147;acute rickets&#148; &hellip; the scurvy being an essential and the rickets a variable element&#146;, which appeared in <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>. For his Bradshaw lecture of 1894, entitled &#145;Infantile scurvy and its relation to rickets&#146;, Barlow added thirty-three more cases from his own personal experience.<br>
<br>In other diseases of children Barlow also made major contributions, notably in the study of meningitis and rheumatic illness. In 1878, in association with S. J. Gee, he published an article &#145;Cervical opisthotonos of infants&#146; in <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Reports</span> (vol. 14), which was an important contribution to the differentiation of tuberculous from simple meningitis; an account of the former was included in volume 7 of T. C. Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (1899, vol. 7). In volume 7 Barlow also published, with D. B. Lees, &#145;Simple meningitis in children&#146;, which elaborated further the distinction between forms of the disease. In 1881, with Francis Warner, Barlow presented to the International Medical Congress a paper on the subcutaneous tendinous nodules associated with acute rheumatism in children, establishing their relation to cardiac disease (published in <span class="italic">Transactions of the International Congress of Medicine, London, 1881</span>, 4.116&#150;28). &#145;Rheumatism and its allies in childhood&#146; was printed in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> (1883, 2.509&#150;14). Barlow's other research interests were mainly in the neurological area. He translated Maurice Raynaud's papers &#145;Local asphyxia&#146; and &#145;Symmetrical gangrene of the extremities&#146; from the French, and published a number of cases of the condition known as Raynaud's disease. He contributed an article on the latter to volume 6 of Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span>, together with another on erythromelalgia, a related condition mainly affecting the feet. In 1906 Barlow addressed the Neurological Society, of which he was president, on nervous complications of acute febrile diseases, his paper later appearing in <span class="italic">Brain</span> (23.303&#150;31).<br>
<br>Most of Barlow's important research was accomplished by the age of forty. After the mid-1880s his attention was increasingly focused on private practice. Resident first in Bloomsbury and, from 1887, at 10 Wimpole Street, he ministered to an ever more elevated circle of private patients, including the dukes of Grafton and Rutland, lords Selborne and Salisbury, and Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1896 he was appointed physician to the royal household and, from 1899 to 1901, he was physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria, being present at her deathbed. He continued to hold court appointments under Edward VII and also under George V. In 1901 he was created a baronet and, later the same year, was appointed KCVO.<br>
<br>Barlow's Wesleyan upbringing influenced his whole life. Until middle age he was an active Methodist, and at King's Cross chapel he was a leader in the weekly <span class="roman">Bible</span> class; later he attended Church of England services. He was a lifelong teetotaller and, from 1923 to 1930, he was president of the National Temperance League. Barlow's later life was laden with honours. He was elected FRS in 1909 and president of the Royal College of Physicians the following year, serving until 1914. In 1913 he presided at the Seventeenth International Medical Congress, held in London. In retirement Barlow spent more time at his country home, Boswells, near Wendover in Buckinghamshire. He continued to travel, at home and abroad, accompanied by his surviving daughter, Helen (1887&#150;1975), who never married. He died at 10 Wimpole Street on 12 January 1945, aged ninety-nine.<br>
<br>Barlow was short and stout, with a carefully trimmed beard, and he always wore spectacles. Throughout his life he retained traces of a Lancashire accent. His avuncular appearance matched his character, which was modest and humane.<br>
