</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philidor,  Fran&ccedil;ois-Andr&eacute; Danican</span>  (1726&#150;1795), <span class="occ">musician and chess player</span>, was born at Dreux, France, on 7 September 1726, the youngest child from his second marriage, to Elisabeth Leroy, of Andr&eacute; Danican Philidor &#145;l'a&icirc;n&eacute;&#146; (<i>c</i>.1647&#150;1730), composer, instrumentalist, and librarian, the presiding genius of the Philidor manuscript collection. His half-brother Anne Danican Philidor founded the Paris Concert Spirituel. Danican, the original family name, may be a corruption of the Scottish Duncan; anecdotally, the name Philidor was used since Louis XIII dubbed his own outstanding court oboist Michel Danican, great-grandfather of Fran&ccedil;ois-Andr&eacute;, &#145;another Filidori&#146;, after the celebrated Italian oboist.<br>
<br>As a composer Philidor's importance exceeds all other members of his family; in addition, he was the finest chess player of his age, certainly in northern Europe. He was orphaned at the age of four, but the family enjoyed royal favour, and when aged six he joined the royal chapel at Versailles. There he studied under Andr&eacute; Campra and learned the rudiments of chess from his fellow musicians, exhibiting precocity in both fields. All his early music is lost, but a motet was performed at Versailles as early as 1738, and another in Paris in 1743: Philidor moved to Paris in 1740. He assisted Jean-Jacques Rousseau with his opera&#150;ballet <span class="italic">Les muses galantes</span>, and otherwise made a living as a copyist and teacher. He quickly became known at the Caf&eacute; de la R&eacute;gence as a strong chess player, capable of extending the skill of the great L&eacute;gal.<br>
<br>Philidor's long association with London began through a misfortune. In 1745 he embarked on a concert tour of the Netherlands, but it was cancelled when one of his fellow musicians died. Left without resources in Amsterdam, he exploited for money his skill at chess and Polish draughts. Some British officers helped him reach London, which became his base from 1747 to 1754; among his patrons were John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, and William Augustus, duke of Cumberland. During this period he visited Holland and the court of Frederick II of Prussia. He frequented English chess venues such as Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane, defeating the strongest English player, Sir Abraham Janssen, and the Syrian Phillip Stamma. He organized his thoughts into the first serious investigative study of the game, <span class="italic">L'analyze des &eacute;checs</span>, published in Aachen (1748) and London (1749), with important second editions in French (as <span class="italic">Analyse du jeu des &eacute;checs</span>) and English in 1777 and a third edition in 1790. It was reprinted into the twentieth century, and translated into nearly 100 languages. Philidor's understanding of pawn play (he declared pawns &#145;the soul of chess&#146;) revolutionized strategy; &#145;Philidor's defence&#146;, though no longer used in grand master chess, remained in the repertory for many years.<br>
<br>No compositions survive from this period, but Philidor evidently studied music more modern than was available in France, especially Italian music, then much favoured in London. His friend the <i>philosophe</i> Denis Diderot persuaded him to return to Paris in 1754. He defeated L&eacute;gal to become the undisputed master at chess, but he was refused a musical post at Versailles because his trial motet <span class="italic">Lauda Jerusalem</span> was considered too Italian. He published some quartets (<span class="italic">L'art de la modulation</span>), and from 1756 seized the chance to compose theatre music. The suburban &#145;fair theatres&#146; were giving irresistible momentum to the genre of <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i>, which the established theatre in Paris (Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Musique) was no longer able to suppress. Philidor was the first important French composer in this genre, although preceded by the Italian Egidio Duni and soon rivalled by Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny. In <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i> an Italian style was no obstacle, and he sensitively modified it to French words. His earliest theatre works, including arrangements and collaborations, are lost, but from <span class="italic">Blaise le savetier</span> (Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Foire St Germain, 1759), most of them were published. <span class="italic">Blaise</span> is a witty one-act farce to a text by M. J. Sedaine, the leading librettist of early <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i> after Favart. A. F. Qu&eacute;tant wrote the text for the popular <span class="italic">Le mar&eacute;chal ferrant</span> (Foire St Laurent, 1761), in which the composer evokes the m&eacute;tiers of the blacksmith and coachman. In <span class="italic">Le b&ucirc;cheron</span> (Com&eacute;die Italienne, 1763) he ingeniously parodied the old French style. His orchestration is simple and effective, and his pleasing melodies characterize persons and situations, but his particular gifts were making music out of scenes of normal life, and composing complicated but lucid ensembles in which different characters express their feelings simultaneously.<br>
<br>In 1760 Philidor married the singer Ang&eacute;lique Richer (<i>fl</i>. 1750&#150;1800); they had seven children and were a devoted couple, her lively character and shrewdness compensating for his own quiet manner and na&iuml;vety. Philidor became the tool of a party which attempted to overthrow traditional French opera, led by A. A. H. Poinsinet, described in Monnet's memoirs and Grimm's <span class="italic">Correspondance litt&eacute;raire</span> as a weak poet of monumental conceit, the perpetual butt of practical jokes. Yet Poinsinet wrote the librettos for Philidor's greatest triumphs. After <span class="italic">Le sorcier</span> (1764) Philidor was the first composer called to acknowledge applause from the stage. <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1765), a radical compression of Fielding, flopped until revised by Sedaine (1766), when thanks to Philidor's evocation of the hunt (Squire Western), his portrayal of Sophia through the formal <i>scena</i> of serious opera, and his brilliant ensembles, one in seven parts, it was recognized as his best work; it has had several modern revivals.<br>
<br>Poinsinet next adapted an Italian libretto for the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. <span class="italic">Ernelinde, princesse de Norv&egrave;ge</span> breached many conventions of that house: it was in only three acts, there were no supernatural characters (although a grandiose sacrifice scene included altars to Odin and Frigga), and while the recitative honoured French tradition, the arias were in Philidor's Italian-derived style. A pamphlet war accompanied its production, and it achieved a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>. <span class="italic">Ernelinde</span> anticipated a change in French opera which was consummated by the arrival of Gluck in 1774; in turn Gluck paved the way for <span class="italic">Ernelinde's</span> successful revival in 1777, after which Philidor presented two further, unsuccessful, works at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale (<span class="italic">Pers&eacute;e</span>, 1780; <span class="italic">Th&eacute;mistocle</span>, 1785).<br>
<br>By the 1770s <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i> was dominated by Monsigny and Gr&eacute;try, and Philidor's later production was sporadic. Unable, or unwilling, to develop his musical range, he turned back to chess for a livelihood and from 1775 divided his time between Paris and the London season. He was not musically idle, composing motets for the Concert Spirituel (lost) and in London his grandest concert work, <span class="italic">Carmen saeculare</span>, written at the suggestion of Giuseppe Baretti, who adapted the text from several odes of Horace. Masonic symbolism graces the title-page of the beautifully engraved score; the first performance was in Freemasons' Hall (1779), and the following year <span class="italic">Carmen saeculare</span> was acclaimed in Paris. In 1789 Philidor composed an <span class="italic">Ode on His Majesty's Recovery</span> for King George III, now lost. At his death an opera derived from Marmontel's <span class="italic">B&eacute;lisaire</span> was left incomplete; it too is lost.<br>
<br>Although eclipsed as a musician, Philidor remained the strongest chess player in England and France, and was well known to society in both capital cities. This agreeable life continued until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. Philidor, then in London, was unfairly proscribed as an &eacute;migr&eacute; and cut off from his family. Despite his difficulties and illness (probably gout), he continued giving displays of blindfold chess until June 1795. His family finally succeeded in obtaining permission for him to return to Paris, but by the time the news reached London, Philidor had already died, it is said partly of grief, on 31 August 1795 at 10 Little Ryder Street. He was buried from St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>From L&eacute;gal, Philidor learned the concept of simultaneous and blindfold chess; but no one before him had combined these skills, and his persistence in exercising them (naturally for money) caused anxiety to Diderot, who urged him to desist in case it drove him mad. Philidor's chess strength is hard to estimate since he nearly always conceded odds to his opponent, and nearly always won, but in his own time he was nonpareil. It appears that the mental powers which served him so well&#151;clear memory of successful moves and combinations, and skill in applying them in new games&#151;had mixed results for his musical reputation. Even in his lifetime he was accused of plagiarism, and in some instances the charge can be sustained. Burney in <span class="italic">The Present State of Music</span> referred to &#145;Philidor's Italian plunder&#146;. Since musical styles were then international, and more conventional than in later periods, plagiarism implied more than merely borrowing a short phrase, something most composers did. In <span class="italic">Le sorcier</span> and <span class="italic">Ernelinde</span> relatively extended passages have been identified which originated with Gluck and Jommelli. This offence was almost certainly inadvertent, and should not detract from the originality of Philidor's output; his ensembles (in which plagiarism is hardly possible) surpassed all available models. No doubt what contemporaries called the &#145;revolution in French music&#146; would soon have come about without Philidor, whereas the revolution in the analytical understanding of chess owed nearly everything to his insight. In <span class="italic">Le neveu de Rameau</span> Diderot called Philidor &#145;le subtil&#146; (and L&eacute;gal, &#145;le profond&#146;), but his achievements in both fields warrant the sobriquet &#145;Philidor le grand&#146;.<br>
