<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hollinworth,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, son of Francis Hollinworth (<i>d</i>. 1657) and his wife, Margaret Wirrall or Worrall (<i>d</i>. 1642), was born at Manchester and baptized on 15 November 1607 at Manchester collegiate church. He was educated at the Manchester grammar school and Magdalene College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1627, and proceeding MA in 1630. His Cambridge contemporaries included other future Lancashire and Cheshire puritan ministers&#151;John Angier, Christopher Hudson, and Samuel Torshell.<br>
<br>Hollinworth's first clerical appointment after his ordination was to a curacy at Middleton, Manchester. He had moved to the new chapel at Salford by 1636 (having preached at its dedication service on 20 May 1635) and remained there until the 1640s. He succeeded William Bourne as fellow of the collegiate church, Manchester, in 1643. During the suspension of the corporate body of the college by the parliament he officiated, along with Richard Heyrick, the warden, as a &#145;minister&#146; and dropped his title of fellow, although the college was not actually dissolved until 1650. The protestation of the people of Salford in 1642 had been taken before him as minister of the town. In 1644 he was named in an ordinance of parliament for ordaining ministers in Lancashire. During an outbreak of plague in Manchester in 1645 he worked unstintingly among the people, his duties being increased through Heyrick's absence in London at the Westminster assembly.<br>
<br>Hollinworth, as a staunch presbyterian, was vocal both in preaching and in print in his opposition to the idea of religious toleration and to the Independents of the Manchester region in particular. <span class="italic">An Examination of Sundry Scriptures alleadged by our Dissenting Brethren</span> (1645) and <span class="italic">Certain Queres Modestly (though Plainly) Propounded to such as Affect the Congregational Way</span> (1646) were two such products of this pamphlet warfare, and Samuel Eaton and Timothy Taylor of Dukinfield were their principal targets. He corresponded on this subject with Thomas Edwards who incorporated Hollinworth's disclosures in his <span class="italic">Gangraena</span>  (1646, 3.67, 166).<br>
<br>Hollinworth and Heyrick played a prominent part in ensuring that the presbyterian experiment in Lancashire, established by parliamentary ordinance on 2 October 1646, was much more vigorous than that enacted elsewhere. Held in high esteem by his co-religionists&#151;Henry Newcome, for instance, sang his praises and was still invoking his memory in the 1670s&#151;Hollinworth readily assumed the role of a local leader. His name is the second of those appended to the harmonious consent of the Lancashire ministers with the ministers of London, in 1648, in which toleration is strongly condemned. He evidently assisted in preparing the Lancashire answer to the Levellers' <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> in 1649, and in that year also he wrote a popular work in favour of the presbyterian system, entitled <span class="italic">The main points of church government and discipline plainly and modestly handled by way of question and answer</span>. The short introductory epistle was signed by Christopher Love.<br>
<br>After the battle of Worcester in September 1651, Hollinworth, along with Heyrick and Angier, was imprisoned on suspicion of &#145;some correspondence with the King his going through the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Henry Newcome</span>, 1.33), but he was soon released and returned to Manchester. He was centrally involved in the discussions which lay behind a succession of collective statements by the Lancashire presbyterian ministers in the 1650s. Along with Newcome and Angier he took a leading part in local debates on the taking of the engagement oath. In the Manchester classis he generally acted as moderator during Heyrick's absence. He was named in the parliamentary ordinance of 29 August 1654 as a commissioner for ejecting scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters in Lancashire.<br>
<br>When Humphrey Chetham drew up his will for the foundation of the public library known by his name, he nominated Hollinworth one of his feoffees and as one of his chosen instruments for the setting up of smaller libraries in outlying churches and chapels in the Manchester area. Hollinworth continued to publish and to confront the destabilizing errors of the Quakers and other sects. <span class="italic">The Catechist Catechised</span> and <span class="italic">The Holy Ghost on the Bench</span> appeared in 1653 and 1657 respectively. In a modest way he was also a historian. He compiled <span class="italic">Mancuniensis</span>, a history of the town in which he had been born and with whose leading commercial families&#151;the Mosleys, Chethams, Nugents, and Hollands&#151;he was connected. Unfinished at the time of his death, it was belatedly published in Manchester in a very inadequate edition in 1839.<br>
<br>Hollinworth died suddenly in Manchester on 3 November 1656, aged forty-nine, and was buried two days later in Manchester collegiate church, where his wife, Margaret, had been interred two years before. Of his five children only one, Ann, survived him. His own father, however, lived to be over 100 and died in 1657. At the meeting of the Manchester classis on 11 November 1656 it was agreed that a day of fasting should held on 3 December with sermons from Edward Gee and John Tilsey &#145;upon the occasion of the sad breach made in the congregation by the death of Mr Hollinworth, late minister there, to desire the Lord's guidance in the election of a minister to succeed him&#146;  (Shaw, 2.253).<br>
