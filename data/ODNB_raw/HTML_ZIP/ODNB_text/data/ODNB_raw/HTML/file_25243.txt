<span class="headword">Sharrock,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and natural historian</span>, was baptized at Drayton Parslow, Buckinghamshire, on 29 June 1630, one of the four sons and two daughters of Robert Sharrock (<i>d</i>. 1671) and his wife, Judith. His father was rector of Drayton Parslow from 1639 to 1642 and subsequently of Adstock, in the same county. In 1643 he went to Winchester School as a scholar, and in March 1649 the parliamentary visitors elected him perpetual fellow of New College, Oxford. He matriculated in November 1650, graduating BCL in October 1654 and proceeding DCL in May 1661.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Sharrock was one of those active around the university's botanic garden and in the circle of scientifically minded people who met in the Oxford lodgings of the Hon. Robert Boyle. These meetings, which preceded the foundation of the Royal Society in 1662, included several who went on to be its founding fellows, their discussions embracing chemistry, physics, and medicine. By 1660, when his own illness and an outbreak of smallpox in the university drove him to the family home at Adstock, and Boyle was living in London, Sharrock was overseeing Boyle's publications through the press at Oxford; as he wrote to Boyle on 9 April:<blockquote>I shall willingly promise that except only some studies altogether necessary for mee, wch will not take up one halfe of my studyeing time, I shall doe no other business but yours in this overlooking of Copy, the Presse, and rendering from Latine. (RS, Boyle letters, 5, no. 88)</blockquote>This referred to Boyle's <span class="italic">New Experiments Physico-Mechanical</span>, written by Boyle in English, which Sharrock and his junior helpers were translating into Latin for simultaneous publication in both languages. In December Sharrock's father settled on him the rent of a small property in Northampton, to augment his fellowship, as he had given up a bursarship and tutorships &#145;in change for study whch is a better employment&#146;  (ibid., 5, no. 92), and in the hope that this income would equal the cost of maintaining his laboratory, where from time to time he copied experiments described by Boyle. He also contributed prefaces for Boyle's other treatises which were issued during this period.<br>
<br>At the same time, with Boyle's encouragement, Sharrock had been writing his own book, <span class="italic">The History of the Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables</span>, published in Oxford, probably with Boyle's financial assistance, in 1660, with later editions in 1666 and 1672. &#145;Written according to observations made from Experience and Practice&#146; (title-page) and intended as a practical text for husbandmen and gardeners, it included some perceptive remarks on the germination of seeds, on the external morphology of seedlings, and on the different ways of propagating, by offshoots, layering, grafting, and the taking of cuttings. Sharrock mused on the similarity of some plant forms and their possible relationship, and on the mathematical symmetry in the arrangement of bud and leaf, and the possibility of finding some natural law which controlled their growth: &#145;even in the wayes of Propagation that are most artificial, there is more of Nature than of Art &hellip; it is the great Art of Man to find out the Arts of Nature&#146;  (p. 4).<br>
<br>While still at Oxford, Sharrock also published <span class="italic">De officiis secundum naturae jus</span> (1660), a hypothesis of the law of nature (a concept derived from classical Greece), in which he contested Hobbes's views of ethics and politics, and <span class="italic">Judicia (seu legum censurae) de variis incontinentiae speciebus</span> (1662), with definitions and penalties for adultery, polygamy, fornication, rape, sins against nature, and incest. In 1663 and 1664 he published his edition of William Lyndwood's influential <span class="italic">Provinciale vetus provinciae Cantuariensis</span>, a collection of constitutions and statutes of the archbishops of Canterbury from 1222 to 1415, compiled between 1422 and 1434, to which had been added in the early sixteenth century the contributions of the cardinal legates Otto and Ottobuono.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1665 Sharrock took up the rectory of Great Horwood, Buckinghamshire, and later in that year he was installed prebendary of Winchester. In 1668 he exchanged Horwood for the rectory of East Woodhay, Hampshire, succeeding his younger brother Edmund (1635&#150;1689), and about this time he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of Edmund West. Their daughters Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1669 or 1670) and Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1672) were followed by a son, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1677 or 1678, <i>d</i>. 1708), who later entered the Inner Temple. Sharrock became rector of Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, in 1669 and archdeacon of Winchester in April 1684. He maintained his interest in natural laws, publishing <span class="italic">De finibus virtutis Christianae</span> (1673) and <span class="italic">Royal Table of the Laws of Human Nature</span> (1682), which was an outline of his earlier <span class="italic">Naturae jus</span>. Sharrock's books were recommended for the study of natural law in Oxford University, while <span class="italic">Naturae jus</span> and <span class="italic">Judicia</span> were reprinted on the continent in 1667 and 1668 respectively. Sharrock died on 11 July 1684, presumably at Bishop's Waltham, and was buried at Bishop's Waltham. His library passed to his son, who doubtless amplified it; at its sale on 11 February 1711 the Bibliotheca Sharrockiana consisted of more than 2000 volumes in several languages, encompassing divinity, history, natural sciences, medicine, and law.<br>
