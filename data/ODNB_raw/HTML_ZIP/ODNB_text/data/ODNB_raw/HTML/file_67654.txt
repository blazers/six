<span class="headword">Samuel,  Harold Solomon</span>  (1879&#150;1937), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born on 23 May 1879 at 37 Bristol Gardens, Paddington, London, the son of Moses Samuel, an auctioneer, and his wife, Victoria Mallaw. At seventeen he entered the Royal College of Music, where he studied piano with Edward Dannreuther and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. At first he was known mainly as a brilliant player of Liszt, but soon he became interested in a wider range of music and virtually abandoned the virtuoso repertoire. Typically, he became one of the coaches in the opera class at the college, and was involved in the earliest English performances of Verdi's <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>, given by students of the college under the direction of Stanford.<br>
<br>Samuel gave his first piano recital on 14 March 1900 at the Steinway Hall in Wigmore Street. The main part of his programme was devoted to the hour-long &#145;Goldberg&#146; variations by J. S. Bach. Today this would cause little surprise; but at that time Bach's keyboard music was rarely heard other than in transcriptions by Liszt, Tausig, or Busoni. In spite of the recital's success, Samuel was forced to abandon the hazardous career of a soloist for the early death of his father had left him with unexpected financial responsibilities. Instead he turned to the more secure if less glamorous work of accompanying and teaching.<br>
<br>At the comparatively late age of forty Samuel took the courageous step of giving up accompanying entirely and devoting himself to solo work. Two years later he gave a series of six daily Bach recitals at the Wigmore Hall (30 May &#150; 4 June 1921), thus establishing himself in the public mind as a Bach specialist (a term he disliked intensely). In all, Samuel gave six of these &#145;Bach weeks&#146; in London, and one in New York in 1928. In later years he restricted himself to single recitals, partly because the mental and physical strain of the &#145;weeks&#146; was excessive, and partly because he felt that his missionary work in establishing Bach's keyboard music had already been accomplished.<br>
<br>Samuel was also a notable chamber music player, and in the 1930s formed a partnership with violinist Isolde Menges, with whom he gave many concerts in the Netherlands and elsewhere. In 1924, at the invitation of Mrs Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, he gave the first of many tours in the USA. He was an important influence, both personally and musically, on another and considerably younger composer, Howard Ferguson (1908&#150;1999).<br>
<br>During the twenty years before he became a soloist, Samuel wrote songs and piano pieces, and a musical comedy, <span class="italic">The Hon'Able Phil</span>, which had a London run. But by far his greatest success in this field was merely acknowledged on the printed cover as &#145;arranged by H. S.&#146;. It was the piano accompaniment to Frederick E. Weatherly's sentimental words, &#145;Danny Boy&#146;, written to the tune of the &#145;Londonderry Air&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1936 Samuel toured South Africa for the last time. On the homeward journey in November he had a severe coronary attack on board ship, and spent six weeks in a nursing home in Southampton. When he finally reached London by ambulance in December his condition was seen to deteriorate, and gradually it became apparent that he had had a secondary attack&#151;probably when being moved from the ship&#151;and that his brain was being affected. On 15 January 1937 Samuel died at his home, 34 Willoughby Road, Hampstead, London; although he was never a practising Jew, a memorial service was held for him three days later at the West London Synagogue. His remains were cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
