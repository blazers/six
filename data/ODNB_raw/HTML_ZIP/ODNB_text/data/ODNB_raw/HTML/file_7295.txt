<span class="headword">Bennet <span class="st"> [Bennett]</span>,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>William Freeman or Hill; <em>called </em> the Golden Farmer]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1690), <span class="occ">thief</span>, of unknown parentage, is at present visible only in the last year of his life. On 9 September 1689 the authorities had&#151;or thought they had&#151;him in Newgate prison and advertised in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> for witnesses to come forward to identify the notorious thief, the Golden Farmer. They knew him under two of his aliases, William Freeman alias Hill, housebreaker, &#145;aged between 50 and 60 years of age&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 9 Sept 1689).<br>
<br>For whatever reason, Bennet was free within a few weeks and on the afternoon of 16 October 1689 he was among those who broke into the house of an Essex magistrate, Charles Palmer, at Gray's Thurrock, stealing over &pound;400 worth of goods. Seven men had attacked the house and four, including Bennet, entered, tying up the magistrate and his servants, forcing Palmer's wife, Elizabeth, at gunpoint to lead them to the valuables in the house, and overcoming some soldiers from a nearby blockhouse who came to investigate the disturbance. On 26 February 1690 he and others robbed the house of Thomas Bird in Ware, Hertfordshire, stealing &pound;500 worth of goods.<br>
<br>However, later that year he was informed against by one of his fellow gang members, who reported other crimes and named his chief accomplices: one Marshal, Jenkins the barber, and &#145;Old Mobb&#146;. Bennet went into hiding but his betrayer's wife and sister, Elizabeth Holt and Anne Holland, found him by following his wife. On 26 September he was drinking at the Rose and Crown ale house in Dorset Gardens in St Bride's when they came in with a warrant to arrest him for a robbery. In the disturbance that followed, with the two women shouting &#145;stop thief, a highwayman&#146;, a soldier, Charles Taylor, tried to detain him. Bennet shot him in the stomach with a double-shotted pistol and fled; Taylor died of his wounds two days later. Bennet took refuge in Southwark, where he was discovered soon after. Chased by a group of butchers, he shot one of his pursuers, who also later died of his wounds, but he was finally cornered and knocked down by brickbats. He was committed to Newgate on 23 October, &#145;accused upon oath for having committed several Robberies upon the Highway and severall Burglaries&#146; and for Taylor's murder  (CLRO, SF374, gaol calendar). Again, advertisements were placed in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, identifying him as &#145;William Netherway, alias Freeman, alias Bennet, but commonly known by the name of The Golden Farmer, a tall red faced Man, his Face full of Pimples, above 50 years of Age, his Head shakes&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 23 Oct 1690).<br>
<br>They also had in custody two of his accomplices, and the advertisement charged the three men with highway robbery on Bagshot and Hounslow heaths and between Edmonton and Enfield&#151;that is, on roads to the south, west, and north of London&#151;and housebreaking in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, and Essex. Elizabeth Palmer came forward and identified Bennet as one of the men who had broken into her house (though she knew him as William Newman, alias Nethway), while Thomas Bird was also bound over to testify against him. Bennet was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey on 18 December 1690 for the Essex housebreaking and for Taylor's murder. Awaiting execution, he showed remorse for his crimes, but insufficient to satisfy the ordinary (the prison chaplain): pressed to make recompense to the victims of his crimes, he asked what more could he give than the law taking his life. The ordinary explained that &#145;he Paid his Life to the Justice of the Law; it made no Satisfaction nor Recompense to those he had despoil'd of their Estates&#146;  (Smith). He must not regard his charity to the poor from the profits of theft as acceptable to God. He was hanged on Fleet Street, near the site of Taylor's murder, on 22 December 1690. On 26 December his body was hanged in chains on Bagshot Heath, Surrey. His death was commemorated in a ballad, <span class="italic">The Golden Farmer's Last Farewell</span>, in which the condemned man acknowledged his involvement with &#145;a gang of robbers, notorious hardy highwaymen who did like ruffians reign&#146; and bade farewell to his accomplice Old Mobb. Within the year Richard Awson, alias Old Mobb, had followed Bennet to the gallows, accused by a fellow gang member, Anthony Dunn, &#145;as being menconed in their Maties proclamacon for being a Notorious Highwayman&#146;  (LMA, MJ/SR 1783, gaol calendar).<br>
<br>The ordinary of Newgate's account and the Old Bailey trial report concur that Bennet was the Golden Farmer. However, his identity became lost when Captain Alexander Smith linked the nickname of the Golden Farmer to the name of <a name="cosubject_7295"></a><span class="headword">William Davis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">reputed highwayman</span>, in his <span class="italic">The History of the Lives of the most Noted Highwaymen</span> (1714), a best-seller which had reached its fifth edition by 1719&#150;20 as <span class="italic">A Compleat History</span>. Smith's William Davis took his nickname from his practice of always settling his debts in gold. In the account provided by Smith and elaborated on by later Grub Street hacks, Davis was born into a farming family near Wrexham in Denbighshire and moved to Chipping Sodbury in Gloucestershire, where he married the daughter of a wealthy innkeeper with whom he had eighteen children. He later settled near Bagshot Heath, Surrey, living a double life as a respectable farmer and busy highwayman, unsuspected by his neighbours, for over forty years. The many robberies attributed to Davis by Smith are characterized by cunning, repartee, and ruthlessness, often involving a sort of rough-and-ready justice against social stereotypes ripe for their come-uppance&#151;a canting Quaker, a tinker, a greedy lawyer, a dim gentleman, a magistrate. Once Davis confided to a wealthy grazier that there were highwaymen about and asked him to hide some money for him. In hiding the money, the grazier inadvertently showed Davis where he had concealed 50 guineas of his own. Soon Davis announced that since nobody would take the trouble to rob either of them that day, he would be obliged to rob the grazier himself. On another occasion, he held up Anne Monck, duchess of Albemarle, on Salisbury Plain. Having been the well-known scold Nan Clarges before her marriage, it is not surprising that she obstinately refused to hand over anything. Infuriated, Davis forcibly removed her rings while at the same time reproaching her for her painted face.<br>
<br>According to Smith, Davis was a master of disguise, which helps explain why he went undetected among his neighbours. One anecdote recounts that Davis, having paid 70 guineas rent to his landlord, caught up with him later in full disguise and took back his money; the landlord never suspected that he had been robbed by his own tenant. Later accounts claimed that Davis may have given up highway robbery for some years as his farming business (and according to one version a corn-chandler's shop in Thames Street, London) prospered. He robbed again when he needed money to buy adjacent farmland. The same later accounts claimed that Davis was shot in the back as he escaped from a hold-up and was taken to the King's Arms at Bagshot, where his identity was revealed to his astonished neighbours.<br>
<br>Smith certainly knew something of the real Golden Farmer. Though he presented Davis as a man who worked alone, he recorded his association with Old Mobb (in his life of the latter). His account of the pursuit of the Farmer is reasonably true to the actual event. Smith gave Davis's date of execution, in his sixty-fourth year, in Fleet Street, as 20 December 1689; almost exactly a year out from Bennet's. Smith evidently conflated William Davis (one of several men of that name who appears in the sessions records in the 1680s and 1690s), who was convicted of burglary at the Old Bailey sessions in December 1689, with the real Golden Farmer, John Bennet, convicted in December the following year. Smith may have known that he had misidentified the Golden Farmer. However, historical accuracy was not a high priority in Smith's picaresque accounts of highwaymen's lives.<br>
