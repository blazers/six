<span class="headword">Batten,  Edith Mary <span class="st"> [Mollie]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1985), <span class="occ">welfare worker and educationist</span>, was born in London on 8 February 1905, the third of the four children and elder daughter of Charles William Batten, general draper, of High Street, Wandsworth, London, and his wife, Edith Wallis, daughter of Robert Black, of Chelsea, London. The family moved to Southport in 1916, where Mollie Batten was educated at the Southport High School for Girls. In 1925 she gained a BSc in chemistry at the University of Liverpool.<br>
<br>Returning in 1925 to London, where her father died, Mollie Batten had to find work and took a clerical job in an office in Piccadilly, later moving to McVitie and Price's Hendon factory, where she became an assistant to the personnel officer. From here she was dismissed owing to a disagreement with management over the treatment of a worker. In 1928 she became secretary of the Invalid Children's Aid Association branch in West Ham. Residing in the St Helen's Settlement, Stratford, she became a member of the Church of England, being prepared for confirmation by the vicar of Barnet, the Revd Leslie Hunter. During this time she attended evening classes at the London School of Economics and gained a BSc (Econ) degree in 1932.<br>
<br>Mollie Batten was appointed warden of the Birmingham settlement in 1933 and soon became a nationally recognized pioneer in the training of social workers and youth workers. She helped to rebuild and expand the settlement's premises and was responsible for changes in its constitution, which brought the warden and staff representation on to its council. In 1937&#150;8 she was a JP for the city of Birmingham.<br>
<br>In 1938 Mollie Batten became organizing secretary of the British Association of Residential Settlements. The <span class="roman">Hire Purchase Act</span> (1938) owed much to evidence she had collected. She became a member of the Ministry of Labour's Factory and Welfare Advisory Board in 1938, and in 1940 she joined the ministry itself. She had a particular concern for the welfare of workers outside working hours. In 1942 she was appointed to the Manpower Services Board and was involved in the call-up of women in the London area. Offered a permanent civil service appointment, she nevertheless resigned in 1947 and went to St Anne's College, Oxford, where she read for a theology degree, gaining a second-class honours BA in 1949 (MA, 1953).<br>
<br>This and her past experience splendidly equipped Mollie Batten to become principal of William Temple College in 1950. The college, which she moved from Hawarden, Flintshire, to Rugby in 1954, was a memorial to the archbishop and was initially to be a theological college for women. Under Mollie Batten's imaginative guidance, and with the unflagging support of her old friend Leslie Hunter, now bishop of Sheffield and chairman of governors, it became a unique centre for the study of the secular realities of modern society in the light of Christian faith. There were resident students on two- and three-year courses for the Cambridge diploma and certificate in religious knowledge. But large numbers of men and women came on short courses from industry, social work, education, administration, and the civil service. Mollie Batten's wide field of contacts in these areas enabled her to bring in a steady flow of distinguished speakers to stimulate penetrating yet practical thought on the topics in hand. To avoid a tendency to heavy cigarette smoking she took to smoking a small pipe while listening to lectures. Sadly, the churches failed to perceive the value of the college or to support it in any way, although the growing number of industrial chaplains found in it and in its principal an important resource. Engagements with the World Council of Churches, with the church in Canada and in Hong Kong, and contacts in Germany nevertheless demonstrate an impressive reputation outside Britain.<br>
<br>Mollie Batten retired to London in 1966 but continued in part-time research work for the church assembly's board for social responsibility. After moving to Midhurst, Sussex, in 1969 she played an active part in the diocese of Chichester and the neighbouring diocese of Portsmouth, presiding in the latter over a working party on the south Hampshire development plan. She was sometime chairman of the Chichester constituency Labour Party.<br>
<br>Mollie Batten was a lifelong supporter of the Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women. Her vigorous intellect, innovative spirit, warmth of character, and infectious enjoyment of life evoked exceptional responses of loyalty and affection. She was appointed OBE in 1948. She died at the Cottage Hospital, Midhurst, on 27 January 1985. She was unmarried.<br>
