<span class="headword">Nettleship,  John Trivett</span>  (1841&#150;1902), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born at Kettering, Northamptonshire, on 11 February 1841, the second son of Henry John Nettleship, solicitor, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19912/', "Henry Nettleship")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19913/', "Richard Lewis Nettleship")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35201/', "Edward Nettleship")</script>. His mother was Isabella Ann, daughter of James Hogg, vicar of Geddington and master of Kettering grammar school. Music was hereditary in the family, and Nettleship was for some time a chorister at New College, Oxford. Afterwards he was sent to the cathedral school at Durham, where his brother Henry had preceded him. Having won the English verse prize on &#145;Venice&#146; in 1856, he was taken away comparatively young in order to enter his father's office. There he remained for two or three years, finishing his articles in London. Though admitted a solicitor, and in practice for a brief period, he decided to devote himself to art, for which he had shown an aptitude from childhood. Accordingly he entered himself as a student at Heatherley's and at the Slade School in London, but to the last he was largely independent and self-taught. His first work was in black and white, not for publication, but to satisfy his natural temperament, which always led him to the imaginative and the grandiose. However, none of the designs conceived during this early period was ever properly finished. They include biblical scenes, such as <span class="italic">Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</span> and <span class="italic">A Sower Went Forth to Sow</span>, which show the influence of William Blake. Nothing was published under his own name except a poor reproduction of a <span class="italic">Head of Minos</span> in the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> (April 1904). But the illustrations to <span class="italic">An Epic of Women</span> (1870), by his friend Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy, are his; and his hand may likewise be traced in a little volume, <span class="italic">Emblems</span>, by A. Cholmondeley (1875), where his name erroneously appears on the title-page as &#145;J. J. Nettleship&#146;. On 15 April 1876 he married Adaline Cort, daughter of the otologist James Hinton; she survived him with three daughters. The eldest, Ida, studied at the Slade School and was married to Augustus John; she died in Paris in 1907.<br>
<br>Nettleship delighted in physical activity: he rode to hounds as a boy, took boxing lessons from a famous prize-fighter when he went to London, is reputed to have walked to Brighton in a day, and accompanied a friend, Henry Cotton, on a mountaineering expedition to the Alps, for which they trained barefoot. It was this delight in physical prowess and in wild life that now induced him to become a painter of animals. He made studies, almost daily, in London's zoological gardens; and for twenty-seven years (1874&#150;1901) exhibited large-scale paintings of lions, tigers, and so on at the Royal Academy and for most of the period at the Grosvenor Gallery. <span class="italic">Puma Devouring a Peacock</span>, in many respects &#145;his strongest and most characteristic&#146; work  (Bryan, <span class="italic">Painters</span>, 4.14), was exhibited at Burlington House. Though always noble in conception and often effective in grouping and in colour, these pictures failed somewhat in technique. At one time more than a dozen of them were exhibited together in the Corn Exchange at Gloucester; but a scheme for purchasing the collection fell through, and they were dispersed. In 1880 Nettleship was invited to India by the Maharaja Gaikwar of Baroda, for whom he painted a cheetah hunt as well as an equestrian portrait; he was thus able to observe animals in their natural habitat. In his later years he worked in pastel, and, painting his old subjects on a smaller scale, acquired a wider measure of popularity.<br>
<br>Nettleship's interests were not confined to painting. In 1868 he published a volume of essays on Robert Browning's poetry (enlarged third edition published as <span class="italic">Robert Browning: Essays and Thoughts</span>, 1895). The book prompted an intimate friendship between the poet and his critic. Another book that shows both his power of literary expression and his opinions about his own art is <span class="italic">George Morland and the Evolution from him of some Later Painters</span> (1898). He illustrated a number of books, including <span class="italic">Natural History Sketches among the Carnivora</span> by A. Nicols (1885) and <span class="italic">Icebound on Kolguev</span> by A. B. R. Trevor Battye (1895).<br>
<br>After a long and painful illness Nettleship died at 33 Beaumont Street, London, on 31 August 1902, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. A memorial tablet in bronze, designed by Sir George Frampton, with the aid of two fellow artists who were born in the same town as Nettleship, Sir Alfred East and Thomas Cooper Gotch, has been placed in the parish church at Kettering.<br>
