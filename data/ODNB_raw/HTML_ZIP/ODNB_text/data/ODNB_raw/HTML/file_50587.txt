<span class="headword">Digby, Sir  Kenelm Edward</span>  (1836&#150;1916), <span class="occ">lawyer and civil servant</span>, was born on 9 September 1836 at The Ridge, Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, the eldest of six sons of the Hon. and Revd Kenelm Henry Digby (1811&#150;1891), honorary canon of Norwich and rector of Tittleshall, Norfolk, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of Edward Sheppard of Firgrove, Shropshire. The Digbys were an old-established county family from Dorset, with a strong tradition of public service. His father's elder brother became the ninth Baron Digby in 1856.<br>
<br>Digby attended a school in Blakeney, Norfolk, and from Harrow School (1849&#150;55) gained a closed scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford (where he matriculated in 1855). As an undergraduate he played cricket for the university (1857&#150;9), became president of the union, and took firsts in classical honour moderations and Greats (BA 1859, MA 1861). He was elected a fellow and tutor of Corpus (1864), where he threw himself into the teaching and study of law, continued to excel at cricket and rowing for his college, and became a leading and seemingly universally popular figure of his generation. He was called to the bar as a member of Lincoln's Inn in 1865.<br>
<br>From 1868 to 1874 Digby was Vinerian reader in English and civil law at Oxford and in 1875 was a university examiner for the new school of jurisprudence. Concerned about the lacuna in law textbooks for undergraduates, he published <span class="italic">An Introduction to the History of the Law of Real Property</span> (1875), which became a standard text and ran to five editions. At Oxford, Digby moved in the same circles as a group of young reformers associated with the positivist movement, and became a close friend of Frederic Harrison. As a young barrister in London he shared chambers with his lifelong friend and contemporary James Bryce, who was also a member of Lincoln's Inn. He was a strong supporter of Gladstonian Liberalism and believed in &#145;the greater importance of giving substantial power to the working classes&#146;. Later in his life he was involved in working out fair and effective means of compensating workmen for industrial injuries.<br>
<br>Digby married on 30 August 1870 Caroline (1848&#150;1926), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26681/', "Edward Strutt, first Baron Belper")</script>, the Liberal politician. They settled in Kensington in their early married life, when he left Oxford to make his career as a young barrister, and had four children&#151;two sons and two daughters. Always an enthusiast for physical activity and travel, Digby was a keen sportsman, a good shot, and an experienced fisherman, and in London regularly rode before breakfast. A mountaineer and member of the Alpine Club (from 1867), he recorded many climbs with friends such as Harrison, Bryce, and Courtenay Ilbert. He enjoyed regular holidays with his family, during which they frequently walked and climbed in Scotland, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.<br>
<br>Digby was a sound, learned, and painstaking lawyer with a strong practical sense. In 1892 he was appointed county court judge in Derbyshire and the family moved to Aston Hall just outside Derby. In 1891 he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and in 1904 took silk. He enjoyed his Derbyshire life and was hesitant about abandoning it when in 1894 he was unexpectedly approached on behalf of the Liberal home secretary, H. H. Asquith, about an appointment as permanent under-secretary at the Home Office. However, a strong devotion to public duty weighed in the balance against his fears about his inexperience in administration and public office. Digby was appointed permanent under-secretary at the Home Office in January 1895, succeeding Sir Godfrey Lushington (whom he must have known as another Oxford positivist).<br>
<br>Digby's personal fears about becoming a senior civil servant late in life proved unfounded. Edward Troup, subsequently to fill the same post, later commented that &#145;no one could have been quicker in leaving behind the ways of a lawyer and adapting himself to administrative work on broad and vigorous lines&#146;  (Bryce, 248). In fact, Digby's very lack of detailed personal knowledge about the work of the Home Office may have been an advantage. He arrived at a time when senior civil servants in the department were for the first time forced, through the growth of legislation and the complexity of new responsibilities, to devolve responsibility. Digby recognized that the new breed of open competitive entry officials was now reaching maturity and must shoulder a greater amount of the workload. Part of this derived from new industrial legislation, such as the 1897 <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span>, much of which involved delegated powers and the need for analysis of statistics. On the criminal side of the office's work, the sheer increase in the volume of papers, together with a lack of the necessary legal expertise, led to the departmental scandal of the Beck case in 1904. Digby and his subordinates were blamed for their failure to spot a case of mistaken identity which led to wrongful imprisonment. (The case eventually led to the establishment in 1907 of the court of criminal appeal.)<br>
<br>Immigration was another area of increased activity as England was affected by the great influx of eastern European refugees migrating westwards. Digby was appointed to the royal commission on alien immigration, which reported in 1903. He wrote an influential minority memorandum, which did much to discredit the majority report. He was strongly opposed to the idea of an inquisitorial immigration sub-department with wide powers of investigation and referral of cases to the courts, partly because it involved the reversal of long-established policies on the right of asylum and the law of extradition. Digby's doubts about the practicality of implementing the recommendations of the report were fully justified in the years following the <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span>, 1905.<br>
<br>Digby retired from the Home Office on 9 September 1903, having had a two-year extension of the normal retirement age. He was created KCB in 1898 and GCB in 1906. He was one of the last of a type of Victorian head of department: socially highly placed, a brilliant &#145;all-rounder&#146; who was appointed to the highest ranks of the civil service from outside. Over the subsequent ten years he sat as a member of numerous departmental committees of inquiry, chairing the Home Office departmental committee on workmen's compensation (1904), and acted as an arbitrator in labour disputes. In 1914 he was appointed a member of the commission chaired by Bryce to investigate alleged German war atrocities in Belgium. He died peacefully, after two days' illness, on 21 April 1916 at the Bankes Arms Hotel, Studland, Swanage, Dorset.<br>
