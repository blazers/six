<span class="headword">Ranulf (III)</span> <span class="st"> [Ranulf  de Blundeville]</span>, sixth earl of Chester and first earl of Lincoln  (1170&#150;1232), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14059/', "Hugh, earl of Chester (1147&#150;1181)")</script>, and Bertrada de Montfort.<h2>
<a name="Birthandfamily"></a>Birth and family</h2>Ranulf was born in 1170 according to the Chester annals, a source compiled after 1265 but usually reliable for events of importance to the comital house. Like other dates in the annals&#151;the birth of Hugh (1147), his marriage (1169), and the birth of his second child, Matilda (1171)&#151;it is compatible with record evidence. Ranulf's mother, Bertrada, is now thought to have been sister rather than daughter of Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1188), and hence aunt rather than sister of Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1218), father of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester. Born <i>c</i>.1155, Bertrada lived until 1227 without remarrying. Ranulf had a younger brother, Richard, who is mentioned in his father's acts, but his disappearance after 1181 suggests he died in childhood. The name by which Ranulf has hitherto been known, de Blundeville, has been taken as a reference to his birth at Oswestry on the Shropshire&#150;Wales border. But B. E. Harris demonstrated in 1971 that the name occurs first in the (perhaps late fourteenth-century) Dieulacres annals, and is linked with Oswestry only from the sixteenth century. His birthplace must therefore be regarded as unknown. Ranulf's two marriages, in 1188 or 1189 to Constance of Brittany and in 1200 to Clemence de Foug&egrave;res, produced no children. Because of this, his great inheritance was divided between his four sisters, who had all made important dynastic marriages, and their descendants on his death in 1232.<h2>
<a name="DukeofBrittany"></a>Duke of Brittany</h2>Little is known of Ranulf's upbringing, apparently in Chester. His nurse, Wymarc, came from a local family, and Earl Hugh gave a Cheshire heiress in marriage to &#145;Alexander my son's tutor&#146; <i>c</i>.1177&#150;81  (Barraclough, <span class="italic">Charters</span>, 193&#150;4). Hugh's death on 30 June 1181 made Ranulf a royal ward; incomplete accounts of Chester appear on the pipe rolls down to Michaelmas 1187. Why did the minority end then? The answer must lie in Henry II's ambitious plans for Ranulf, who was soon married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46701/', "Constance (c.1161&#150;1201)")</script>, daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59576/', "Conan (IV), duke of Brittany (c.1135&#150;1171)")</script>, widow of Henry's son Geoffrey since 1186, and custodian of the duchy on behalf of Geoffrey's posthumous son, Arthur. According to the Chester annals, Ranulf was knighted by the king on 1 January 1189 and the wedding followed on 3 February (St Werburgh's day) 1189, but the text is confused at this point and 1188 is more likely for both events. Henry II thus brought the young earl into the forefront of Angevin continental politics, charged with helping to resist French intervention in Brittany. The marriage also augmented Ranulf's English possessions with the honour and earldom of Richmond held in right of his wife. Perhaps by 1190 he celebrated his new status by commissioning a second seal modelled on those of his Breton predecessors, and he also used the titles duke of Brittany and earl of Richmond in his charters, though never consistently.<br>
<br>Ranulf's political activity between 1189 and 1194 did not match this potential importance. He did not accompany Richard I on crusade, despite later legends to this effect, and avoided entanglement in the contests for power among Richard's deputies in England and his brother John. Nor is Ranulf known to have played an important role in Normandy or Brittany. The distribution of charters he issued in this period, many of them in Chester, suggests that the earl's first priority was to take a firm grip of his inheritance after his minority. But in 1194 Ranulf helped to capture Nottingham Castle for the recently released Richard, and then carried a ceremonial sword at the formal crown wearing that followed. By September 1194 he had joined the king in France and spent much of the period from 1194 to 1199 there, mostly in Normandy to judge from his attestations of royal charters. One substantial reward he received was royal acceptance of his claim to the Lincolnshire barony of Bolingbroke on the death of his cousin (they had a common great-grandmother in Countess Lucy, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23127/', "Ranulf (I), third earl of Chester")</script>) William de Roumare in 1198. But however useful Ranulf's support was to Richard I, his success was limited by the token nature of his marriage. Since 1189 Constance had presided over an effectively independent duchy, with little documented influence from her husband. In 1196 Ranulf imprisoned her in his castle of St Jacques de Beuvron on the Norman frontier, driving the Breton nobility into open revolt, while Constance's son, Arthur, took refuge with Philip Augustus of France. Richard may well have supported the earl's actions, and was prepared to back his claims by invading the duchy, but in retrospect the episode seems a last unsuccessful attempt to assert an authority over his wife and her lands that Ranulf had never really possessed.<h2>
<a name="KingJohnloyaltyunderstrain"></a>King John: loyalty under strain</h2>On Richard's death in 1199 Ranulf thus saw no advantage in the succession of his stepson Arthur, the latter backed by his own alienated wife, now freed from captivity. He supported John, and Constance reacted by terminating their marriage (though there is no formal record of this) and making a second alliance at once with the French noble Gui de Thouars. Ranulf accepted, perhaps even welcomed, the inevitable, and in 1200 he married Clemence (<i>d</i>. 1252), daughter of Guillaume de Foug&egrave;res and widow of Alain de Dinan. This second Breton alliance must, in a more modest way, have had similar aims to the first: bolstering the earl's position in western Normandy where he was hereditary vicomte of the Bessin and Avranchin, and hence his influence over the Norman&#150;Breton frontier. Clemence brought him some dower lands in England and Normandy, and the possibility at least of a more successful marriage and the birth of an heir. The fact remains that Ranulf had lost the honour of Richmond, which went to Gui de Thouars on Constance's death in 1201, and then to Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1204), on Gui's defection in 1203. The French conquest of Normandy in 1204 caused him further heavy losses. Nor did Ranulf receive any substantial compensation elsewhere in the early years of John's reign. Some historians have argued that this put great strain on his relations with the king. All that is known for certain is that on two occasions John demanded surrender of lands or castles and security for the earl's loyalty: the first in Normandy in April 1203 just after the defection of the Foug&egrave;res family, the second in England in December 1204, when Ranulf was in alliance with the king's Welsh enemy Gwenwynwyn of Powys. Each time the earl convinced the king of his allegiance and the threatened sanctions were soon lifted. The evidence of charter attestations shows that Ranulf was frequently in attendance on the king, especially during John's last months in Normandy early in 1204. Nevertheless he had suffered heavy losses, and even if there is no real evidence that he was on the verge of rebellion, John seems to have decided not to test his loyalty too far. In March 1205, with Leicester dead, the king granted most of the Richmond lands in Yorkshire to the earl of Chester, along with substantial remissions of debt.<br>
<br>Having devoted much of the first phase of his career, from 1187 to 1204, to the defence of the continental lands of the Angevin empire, Ranulf now embarked on a second phase, from 1205 to 1218, in which he became more and more prominent in domestic politics as a loyal supporter of John, and later of John's son Henry III. He regularly witnessed royal charters, and received a steady flow of the gifts usual for a noble in royal favour. In 1205 and 1209 he was deputed to escort the king of Scots south. He took a leading role in successive Welsh campaigns between 1209 and 1212. At the same time Ranulf systematically consolidated his local rule in Cheshire, where the appearance of a chancellor by 1190 and a justiciar by 1202, as well as the earlier evolution of an &#145;exchequer&#146; modelled on that of the king, give some indication of its exceptional independence. Both the Chester annals and Lucian, a monk of St Werburgh's Abbey writing in the 1190s, call the earl a &#145;prince&#146; (<i>princeps</i>). The comital charters illustrate further development of this distinctive regional autonomy under John, even as the king was putting great pressure on many other magnates' local powers. In the decade 1205&#150;15 both king and earl seem to have concluded that it was in their own interest to treat Cheshire as a special case; this was one reason for Ranulf's loyalism.<br>
<br>In 1214 Ranulf returned to France to participate in John's Poitou campaign, acting as one of the negotiators of the eventual truce with Philip Augustus. In January 1215 he was among the very few magnates to defend John against the initial demands of the baronial dissidents, and no contemporary source suggests any wavering of Ranulf's support through to the promulgation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and the slide into civil war. Probably in the aftermath of John's grant the earl issued his own <span class="roman">Magna Carta of Cheshire</span>, defining local customs, apparently in response to a petition from the honorial baronage. But Ranulf also received great rewards from the king: half of the honour of Leicester in custody for the younger Simon de Montfort in July 1215 (presumably because of his mother), the shrievalties of Lancashire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire in April 1216, and other grants of castles and rebel possessions. Chester's support was crucial to the king once civil war broke out in October 1215: with William (I) Marshal he kept the Welsh march largely loyal; with his brother-in-law William de Ferrers he set up a power bloc in the midlands which helped to neutralize the threat of the northern rebels, and divide them from their allies in the south. Even so, there were limits to the earl's power, and the patterns of allegiance in his lordships was mixed. While his Cheshire tenants followed him almost without exception in supporting the king, the tenants of Richmond in Yorkshire with equal unanimity rebelled, rejecting the influence of their (probably largely absentee) lord. In Lincolnshire the response of tenants was rather more mixed.<h2>
<a name="TheminorityofHenryIII"></a>The minority of Henry III</h2>On John's death in October 1216 Ranulf and William Marshal were the two leading magnate supporters of the young prince Henry. Within days the Marshal had accepted the role of regent, but even the eulogistic <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> makes it clear that he needed, and received, the consent and support of the earl of Chester to do so. Ranulf's role in the subsequent struggle against Louis of France can be traced through formal actions, like his attestation of the revised <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> in November 1216, and also through the piecemeal process of local campaigning and bargaining with individual rebels that followed. In spring 1217 he raised a large force to attack Mountsorrel Castle near Leicester, on which he had a claim, and drew part of Louis's army north in response, precipitating the decisive battle of Lincoln in May. William Marshal and several others played major parts in this victory but Ranulf received the greatest reward: a grant of the earldom of Lincoln, made within days of the battle. In September 1217 he was among those who ratified the peace agreement by which Louis left England. Tensions between the royalist leaders appeared occasionally: some time early in 1217 it was proposed to Pope Honorius III (not necessarily by Ranulf himself) that Chester should be made co-regent with the elderly Marshal. But winning a civil war and then imposing peace without the influence of an adult king was bound to be a delicate process; on balance it is remarkable how little evidence suggests that the earl did anything that destabilized the minority government. Nor did his decision to depart on crusade in June 1218 indicate any lingering ambitions to succeed the Marshal. Ranulf did all he could to safeguard his position, by a private agreement with Llywelyn ab Iorwerth of Gwynedd, and by obtaining quittances of his shrieval accounts, but he was still prepared to take a risk in leaving England for what turned out to be over two years. In doing so, he discharged the crusading vow he had taken with John back in March 1215. He travelled with many relatives and allies, including the earls of Derby and Arundel, and what evidence there is suggests that other participants saw him as the most important of the English leaders. <span class="italic">L'estoire de Eracles empereur</span>, for instance, credits him with leading 100 knights. Ranulf joined the forces of the fifth crusade in Egypt and participated in the capture of Damietta in November 1219, leaving on the return journey in spring 1220 before the crusade ended in disastrous defeat.<br>
<br>Back in England by July 1220 Ranulf went first to Chester where he was received, according to the Chester annals, &#145;with the greatest veneration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales Cestrienses</span>, 50&#150;51). He embarked on a third phase of his career in which, without ever threatening rebellion, he became ambivalent towards a royal government increasingly dominated, after the Marshal's death, by the justiciar Hubert de Burgh. Faced with pressure to surrender castles and custodies he had been granted in the civil war Ranulf gave ground gradually, conceding in 1221, for instance, that he would account for the revenues of his shrievalties outside Cheshire. The nearest approach to conflict came at Christmas 1223, when de Burgh demanded a general resumption of royal rights and property. Ranulf first took the lead in opposing this, then assessed the balance of forces on both sides and yielded, surrendering his custodies and royal castles on 30 December. In 1224, when Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; openly rebelled against the minority regime, Chester was sympathetic enough to give him refuge and intercede for him, but again, not to compromise his own allegiance. This was easier for him because, unlike some of the other old royalists who had now lost ground, he had much to fall back on, including his power base in Cheshire. From 1225 he constructed there a great new castle at Beeston, all too obviously defending the county from England rather than Wales, and intended perhaps as a symbol of the power he still retained. Ranulf also buttressed his position by strengthening the alliance with Llywelyn initiated in 1218. In 1222 he married his nephew John the Scot, son of his sister Mabel and David, earl of Huntingdon, whose custody he had taken over after David's death in 1219, to the Welsh prince's daughter Helen.<h2>
<a name="LastyearsthesuccessiontoChester"></a>Last years: the succession to Chester</h2>Ranulf gave only the most grudging support to royal campaigns against Llywelyn launched by Hubert de Burgh in 1223 and 1231. But on their side de Burgh and his allies did not want to alienate the powerful earl too seriously, so even his ambivalent loyalty was acknowledged. The custody of half of the honour of Leicester returned to him in 1220 became a grant for life in 1227. The Yorkshire lands of the honour of Richmond were regranted in 1227, a grant of royal demesne between Ribble and Mersey in Lancashire was added in 1229. The wardship of John the Scot, retained until John came of age in 1227, was another important concession, all the more so because Ranulf, his second marriage now childless for over twenty years, may already have intended this son of his eldest sister to be his heir for the earldom of Chester. The problem was that his other three sisters also had claims to a share of his property, so creating the risk that Cheshire would have to be divided. This provides an additional motive for the earl's acquisitiveness in his latter years; some of these gains went to swell the shares of the coheirs outside Cheshire to an acceptable size. It may also explain his willingness late in his life to cede custodies which would in any case lapse with his death and could not benefit his heirs. In 1230 he gave up his Richmond lands to the king's unreliable ally Pierre de Dreux, duke of Brittany, and by 1231 he had agreed to transfer his honour of Leicester lands to the king's French prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1265). In May 1232, when Ranulf fell ill while at court, the king undertook to observe the terms of his will. Probably after this he conveyed his earldom of Lincoln to his sister Hawise de Quincy, who in turn granted it to her son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15855/', "John de Lacy (c.1192&#150;1240)")</script>, an arrangement that must have required royal consent. This final manoeuvre meant that all Ranulf's heirs held an earldom.<br>
<br>In 1230&#150;31, perhaps also to maintain good relations with the young king, Ranulf took an active role in his French campaign, eventually taking over command of the English forces in 1231 after Henry's return to England, and negotiating a truce with the French. He was also able to reoccupy his family castle of St Jacques, and revisit the border areas he had contested in the 1190s. On his return to England he quarrelled briefly with the king, probably because he still resented Hubert de Burgh's influence over royal policy towards France, Wales, and domestic patronage. The following year Chester helped to bring about de Burgh's fall from power in July 1232, though in September 1232 he intervened with others to protect the former justiciar from the extreme of royal vengeance. Earl Ranulf died at Wallingford on 26 October 1232. His heart was buried at Dieulacres Abbey in Staffordshire, a Cistercian house which he had refounded in 1214 (it was previously at Poulton in Cheshire), in accordance with the terms of his charter. His body was interred at St Werburgh's Abbey in Chester on 3 November. His properties were divided, with John the Scot installed as earl of Chester by the end of the month, which confirms the impression of a prior agreement, though if so the coheirs subsequently changed their minds, and had issued writs to contest the division by 1235. But even after Ranulf's great earldom was absorbed by the crown after 1237, his reputation persisted and legends about him occur in late medieval sources. Despite an attempt to argue the contrary, there can be little doubt that he was the subject of the &#145;rymes of Randolf erl of chestre&#146; alluded to in <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>  (Langland, 49).<br>
