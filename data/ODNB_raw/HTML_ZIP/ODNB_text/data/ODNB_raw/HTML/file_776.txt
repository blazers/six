<span class="headword">Ashton, Sir  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1425&#150;1487<span class="mult">x</span>90), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/773/', "Sir John Ashton (d. 1427)")</script> of Ashton under Lyne and his second wife, Margaret Gray, and hence half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/779/', "Sir Thomas Ashton (c.1403&#150;c.1460)")</script>, the alchemist, who in 1439 arranged Ralph's marriage with Margery, the daughter and heir of John Barton of Middleton. Middleton became his descendants' main home, but Ashton seems to have preferred Fryton, North Riding of Yorkshire, and his political connections were primarily with Yorkshire. He earned the favour of Edward IV by service to Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1460), and was rewarded with office in the honour of Pickering. He was knighted in 1464 or 1465, perhaps in the course of northern campaigning. In spite of his earlier Neville links Ashton supported Edward IV in his conflict with the earl of Warwick in 1469&#150;71 and was not named on any of the commissions issued during Henry VI's readeption. On Edward's return Ashton was appointed sheriff of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In the 1470s Ashton built links with Richard, duke of Gloucester. It was perhaps Gloucester's influence that kept him in office as receiver of Pickering after his dismissal had been ordered for failure to render account. He fought under the duke in Scotland, and was made a banneret by him in July 1482. After Richard's accession Ashton became a knight of the king's body. In October 1483 he was made vice-constable of England, which gave him a key role in the suppression of Buckingham's rebellion. He was rewarded with forfeited land in Kent, where he had recently acquired interests of his own through his second marriage (described as imminent in July 1483) to Elizabeth, daughter of John Chichele of Wimpole and the widow of John Kyriel of Stockbury, Kent. Ashton was active in Kent throughout Richard's reign, apparently making his home at the Kyriel manor of Westenhanger. Two of his younger sons, Edmund and John, were based there when they assaulted two royal servants in 1484.<br>
<br>Ashton may have avoided Bosworth; he was not attainted by Henry VII. The year of his death is unknown, although it occurred on 10 April. He was still alive in 1486, but by 1490 his widow, Elizabeth, had remarried; her third husband was John Bourchier, a younger son of Henry, earl of Essex. She died on 2 April 1499. With his first wife, Margery, who was still living in 1480, Ashton had six sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Richard, succeeded him at Middleton and died in 1507. The second, Ralph, was married to the Lever heir, Margaret, whom Ralph senior claimed as his ward. Margaret's uncle Roger contested the claim and in 1467 the case was tried at Lancaster. Ashton won, but Roger and his friends stole the record of the case. In 1469 Ashton arranged that Thomas Pilkington should capture Roger, and agreed that he would bear half the damages if Roger were killed, or would use his influence to intervene with the king if the death were adjudged murder.<br>
<br>The episode suggests Ralph Ashton to have been a violent and unscrupulous man, and he passed into folklore in the north-west, where stories variously have him being shot dead by a woman he had raped, or carried off by the devil. Nineteenth-century antiquaries recorded the rhyme:<blockquote>
<div>Sweet Jesu, for thy mercy sake<br>
</div>
<div>And for thy bitter passion<br>
</div>
<div>Save us from the axe of the Tower<br>
</div>
<div>And from Sir Ralph of Ashton.<br>
</div> (Axton, 27)</blockquote>
