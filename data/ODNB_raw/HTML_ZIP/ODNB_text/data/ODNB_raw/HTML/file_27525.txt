<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  Charles</span>  (1808&#150;1897), <span class="occ">science teacher and writer</span>, was born on 27 November 1808 in Tottenham, Middlesex, the younger son of Charles Tomlinson. His father sought to better his condition by enlisting in 1810 but, after serving in Holland, died on the way to India, leaving a widow in straitened circumstances to raise Charles and his elder brother, Lewis (1806&#150;1880). The boys went first to a dame-school then to a large day school for boys. Charles's first employment was in the office of Joseph Woods, architect of the Corn Exchange. He next worked on transcribing <span class="italic">Pepys's Diary</span>, and afterwards was for some years in a lawyer's office. During this time he went to evening classes at the London Mechanics' Institute to study science, and also learned French. Lewis meanwhile maintained himself as a clerk at Wadham College, Oxford, graduated BA in 1829, took holy orders and became classics master in a school in Berkshire. When a vacancy arose in 1830 Charles joined him, teaching elementary Latin and French. A few years later Lewis obtained a curacy near Salisbury, and with his brother founded a school in the city where Charles taught modern languages and experimental science. At this time the brothers married the sisters of one of their students: Charles married Sarah Windsor (<i>d</i>. 1872), and Lewis married her elder sister, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1880).<br>
<br>Charles continued to improve his knowledge of science by attending lectures at University College, London, and elsewhere. Articles he contributed to popular science journals were, with others, reissued in 1838 as <span class="italic">The Student's Manual of Natural Philosophy</span>, which enjoyed a rapid sale and encouraged him in 1848 to leave Salisbury and settle in London. His connection with Parker's publishing house brought Tomlinson into contact with various men of science, among them Sir William Snow Harris, with whom he collaborated on the development of lightning conductors for ships. He gave editorial assistance to the chemist William Thomas Brande, and to John Frederick Daniell, who was preparing a new edition of his <span class="italic">Meteorology</span>. When Daniell died in 1845 Tomlinson and William Allen Miller saw it into print. Tomlinson's wife, who was from an evangelical family, assisted him in all his work, and also wrote books of a moral and religious persuasion for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.<br>
<br>Being by this time a familiar figure at King's College, London, Tomlinson was appointed lecturer in experimental science at King's College School. He took a large house in Hampstead Road where some of the scholars boarded, bringing a family atmosphere to his childless marriage. Tomlinson continued to write on a broad range of scientific and literary topics, but regarded his <span class="italic">Cyclopedia of Useful Arts</span> (1852, enlarged edition 1866) as his major production, coming as it did in the aftermath of the 1851 exhibition when industry and manufacture were advancing rapidly. In addition, his investigation of the behaviour of camphor, and other light and heavy fluids when added to water, led to important theories concerning surface tension of liquids.<br>
<br>Tomlinson's sight worsened in the late 1850s and by 1860, despite a visit to a celebrated German oculist, he was blind in one eye. He nevertheless remained active, being elected to the council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1864, and in the same year to fellowship of the Chemical Society. In 1867 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, serving for many years on its library committee. He retired from teaching in 1866 and moved to Highgate where he continued his experiments in a laboratory fitted up in his house. After several months' illness his wife died in 1872. In his later years Tomlinson turned to literature and the study of poetry, and from 1878 to 1880 he held the Dante lectureship at University College, London. Lewis and Maria Tomlinson both died in 1880 and their daughter Mary moved to Highgate to care for her uncle, who at seventy-three was still mentally and physically active and insisted on her learning to play chess. Latterly he was more frequently ill, and died at his home, 7 North Road, on 15 February 1897. He was buried at Highgate cemetery alongside his wife.<br>
