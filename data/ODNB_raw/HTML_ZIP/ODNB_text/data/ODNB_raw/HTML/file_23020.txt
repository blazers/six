<span class="headword">Rainborowe <span class="st"> [Rainborow]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and Leveller</span>, was the first-born son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23021/', "Captain William Rainborow (bap. 1587, d. 1642)")</script>, Levant merchant and naval officer. His mother, William's first wife, was a daughter of Captain Rowland Coytmore of Wapping. Martha, the first of his two sisters, was briefly married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29778/', "John Winthrop")</script>, governor of Massachusetts, as his fourth wife. His other sister, Judith, married the governor's fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66329/', "Stephen Winthrop")</script>, who became a captain in the New Model Army, and later a colonel. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66326/', "William Rainborowe")</script> was a major in the New Model, but was dismissed in 1649 for his extremely radical opinions.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstcivilwar"></a>The first civil war</h2>Thomas Rainborowe grew up in Wapping, a Thameside parish east of the City. Raised to be a mariner like his father, he is known to have been a trader in currants with the Turkey Company before 1642. At his father's death in that year Thomas inherited all his property in Southwark and &pound;1000. At the outbreak of the civil war it was therefore as a well-to-do young man that he joined the parliamentarian fleet under the earl of Warwick, guarding the Irish Sea to prevent Irish volunteers from joining the king's army in northern England. He had already established an economic stake in Ireland, investing &pound;500 in the spring of 1642 in the Irish adventurers' scheme to reconquer the kingdom in return for land there. In the summer of the same year he was appointed by parliament one of the commissioners for the additional sea adventurers to Ireland, and invested a further &pound;400 to fit out ships for an offensive against the south coast. In the summer of 1643, while commander of the <i>Lion</i>, he captured a ship off the east coast of Scotland bringing reinforcements to the king.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Rainborowe returned to land, and went to assist Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, in the defence of Hull. On 11 October 1643 he led 500 musketeers in a sally against the enemy. After a fierce, see-saw struggle, during which Rainborowe was taken prisoner, the enemy were driven back, and the marquess of Newcastle was obliged to lift the siege. By this time Rainborowe had risen to the rank of colonel, and he remained with the land service for another four years. His next notable exploit was an amphibious assault on Crowland Castle in Lincolnshire, which resulted in the recapture of that fortress. Now an officer in the earl of Manchester's eastern association army, he raised a foot regiment largely officered by returning &eacute;migr&eacute;s from New England.<br>
<br>At the formation of the New Model Army in the spring of 1645 Rainborowe, as a naval officer, was exempted from the terms of the Self-Denying Ordinance, and appointed colonel of foot, despite an attempt by the peers to reject him. With remarkable efficiency he pressed almost 1500 men, returning to the treasury more than half the money allotted to him for the purpose. On 1 June 1645 he captured Gaunt House near Oxford, and less than two weeks later fought at Naseby. At the New Model's second most important battle, Langport, on 10 July he led a party of 1500 musketeers &#145;with admirable resolution&#146; across a stream and uphill through a narrow lane to the royalist position  (Sprigge, 65). He also fought at the sieges of Bridgwater and Sherborne, and took Nunney Castle on 20 August and Berkeley Castle on 25 September. It was at the storming of Bristol on 10 September that, in Cromwell's words, he had &#145;the hardest task of all&#146;  (ibid., 115). The men of his brigade scaled the high walls of Prior's Hill Fort in the face of withering musket- and cannon-fire.<br>
<br>In December 1645 Rainborowe's regiment was sent to blockade Oxford, and on 25 April 1646 Woodstock surrendered to him. When Charles I attempted to negotiate his own reception by the army Rainborowe refused to get involved, and merely passed on the king's proposals to the Commons speaker. After the capitulation of the royalist headquarters at Oxford, Rainborowe was sent to reduce Worcester and was subsequently recommended for the governorship of the city by Sir Thomas Fairfax, who reminded parliament that Rainborowe had been &#145;very faithful, valiant, and successful in many undertakings&#146;  (Cary, 1.138). His career as governor lasted from July 1646 until the following April.<h2>
<a name="Putneyandthenavy"></a>Putney and the navy</h2>In January 1647 Rainborowe was elected the recruiter MP for Droitwich, Worcestershire. But he did not give up his military career, for in May 1647 parliament ordered him to command the forces intended for the recovery of Jersey. His regiment mutinied, however, and threw in its lot with the other New Model regiments in their revolt against parliament. Rainborowe joined them soon afterwards. In recognition of his intelligence and military capability, army headquarters now assigned him increasingly important political and administrative responsibilities. At the end of July he was part of the delegation that presented the army's <span class="italic">The Heads of the Proposals</span> to the king. When Charles answered the officers with foolish intransigence Rainborowe quit the meeting and returned to Bedford where he spread the news of Charles's words among the soldiers.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in the City an attempted counter-revolution provoked the army to march on the capital to restore its friends to their places in parliament. On 4 August Rainborowe led an advance party of 4000 horse and foot that occupied Southwark. Later the same month Sir Thomas Fairfax appointed him to the committee of general officers to advise him on appointments and other policy matters. By now Rainborowe was becoming disillusioned with Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton for persisting in their negotiations with Charles. Cromwell for his part saw Rainborowe as the leader of the faction &#145;that were endeavouring to have no other power to rule but the sword&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 2, appx, xxxix). The antagonism between them also stemmed from Rainborowe's ambition to become vice-admiral of the navy, and Cromwell's desire to thwart him. The two men were at loggerheads, and in the army council Rainborowe blew up at Cromwell and thundered that &#145;one of them must not live&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 30, fol. 67). In the event he obtained the appointment on 27 September 1647, perhaps because Cromwell appreciated that it would remove him from the centre of political power.<br>
<br>In the weeks before he took up his appointment Rainborowe continued to be a thorn in the side of the military grandees. In October and November he played a leading part in the army general council's debates at Putney on the Leveller <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. He poured scorn on Cromwell and others who said of the projected constitution, &#145;Itt's a huge alteration, itt's a bringing in of New Lawes&#146;, commenting, &#145;if writinges bee true there hath bin many scufflinges betweene the honest men of England and those that have tyranniz'd over them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarke Papers</span>, 1.246). When the grandees sought to prolong the discussion of the army's engagements Rainborowe insisted that they move on to address the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. When Ireton attacked the principle of universal manhood suffrage Rainborowe took up the challenge in words that still ring in our ears after more than three-and-a-half centuries:<blockquote>really I thinke that the poorest hee that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest hee; and therefore truly, Sir, I thinke itt's cleare, that every man that is to live under a Government ought first by his owne consent to putt himself under that Government; and &hellip; I should doubt whether he was an Englishman or noe that should doubt of these thinges. (ibid., 1.301)</blockquote>Having, with Ireton, dominated the debates and won many waverers to his way of thinking, Rainborowe went on to persuade the army general council to write to parliament opposing any further addresses to the king. His next move was to demand that the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> be submitted to the whole body of the army at a rendezvous. By now the grandees had had enough. Adjourning the debate they summoned not one but three separate rendezvous of the army, at which they presented, not the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, but a much more limited remonstrance emphasizing army grievances. Rainborowe turned up uninvited to the first rendezvous at Corkbush field near Ware, and attempted to present a copy of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> to General Fairfax, but he was brushed aside.<br>
<br>The consequence of all this radical political activity was that both houses of parliament immediately voted to revoke Rainborowe's appointment as vice-admiral. But with Charles having escaped to the Isle of Wight and a renewal of civil war imminent, the army officers closed ranks. Rainborowe apologized for what he had done and Fairfax urged the lords to reinstate him. They still refused, but the Commons, worried that the fleet might allow Charles to slip through their clutches and flee the kingdom, overrode the lords' veto and on 1 January 1648 ordered Rainborowe at once to take up his command.<br>
<br>The trouble was that neither the sailors nor their officers wanted Rainborowe to be their admiral. They resented having a man of such radical views and so identified with the army foisted upon them. Already by early 1648 the navy was rife with royalism and regarded Rainborowe as a man &#145;not wel-affected to the king, parliament and kingdome&#146;, whose &#145;insufferable pride, ignorance and insolency &hellip; [had] alienated the hearts of the seamen&#146; (<span class="italic">The Declaration of the Navie</span>, 28 May 1648; Penn, 1.258). A royalist uprising in Kent in May quickly spread to the fleet. On 27 May the men of his own flagship, the <i>Constant Reformation</i>, expelled him and bundled him aboard a small vessel bound for London. They justified themselves by denouncing him as &#145;a man of most destructive principles both in religion and policy, and a known enemy to the peace and antient government of this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Declaration of the Officers and Company of Sea-Men abord his Majesties Ships, the Constant Reformation &hellip;</span>, 1648). Rainborowe's authority in the navy was now at an end. Parliament appointed the earl of Warwick lord high admiral again and Rainborowe resumed his colonelcy in the army.<h2>
<a name="Murderandmartyrdom"></a>Murder and martyrdom</h2>Rainborowe joined Fairfax at the siege of Colchester, and was one of the commissioners who negotiated the royalists' surrender at the end of August 1648. In October Fairfax dispatched him northward to take command of the siege of Pontefract Castle. The officer whom he superseded, Sir Henry Cholmley, bitterly resented his displacement, and refused to recognize Rainborowe's authority. Rainborowe retired to Doncaster until parliament should settle the dispute. Perceiving his vulnerability there, a party of cavaliers crept out of Pontefract on 29 October and rode to Doncaster where they surprised the colonel in his quarters. Their intent was to ransom him for Sir Marmaduke Langdale, also a prisoner. But Rainborowe was not one to submit tamely to arrest. He tore himself loose from his captors in the street and brandished his sword crying &#145;armes, armes!&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 34, fol. 27<i>v</i>). No one answered his cry, however, and in the ensuing struggle he was run through with a sword and killed.<br>
<br>The Levellers would later allege that Cromwell was somehow to blame for Rainborowe's assassination. However, the episode was thoroughly investigated at the time, and there is no evidence of Cromwell's being implicated. The body of the fallen hero was brought to London a fortnight after his death. There were reported to be 3000 in the funeral procession, which wound its way through the City, and out through the East End to Wapping where he was buried beside his father. Many elegies were printed demanding vengeance on the royalists for his death; a ballad was composed entitled &#145;Colonell Rainsborowes Ghost&#146;; and his sea-green colours became a badge of Leveller allegiance.<br>
<br>Rainborowe left no will. Some years before his death he had married a woman called Margaret about whom little is known. Together they had a son, William, and at least one other child. Parliament was generous to his widow. She received his full arrears of pay, amounting to over &pound;1300, in addition to &pound;200 per year until land worth &pound;3000 should be granted her. In 1653 and 1654 the treason trustees deeded her the manor of Somerset, Somerset, and the manor of West Derby and Trayles, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Thomas Rainborowe was one of the most vivid actors in the English revolution. A soldier of impressive professional competence and peerless courage, he led his men in a number of daring and successful engagements. During the political crisis of 1647&#150;8 he stepped forward boldly as a tribune of the common soldiers and the poor people of England. He spoke eloquently for the Levellers' <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> and nearly won the army to their side. But his radicalism, as well as his truculent personality, offended many of the higher officers, who sought to remove him from the political debate, first by granting his request to be appointed to the navy, and then by assigning him to a siege in the north of England. Heedlessness of his own safety, combined with stubborn pride, brought about his end. In death he became the most prominent of the Leveller martyrs.<br>
