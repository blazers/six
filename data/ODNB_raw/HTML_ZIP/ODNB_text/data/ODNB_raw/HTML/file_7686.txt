<span class="headword">Disney,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1857), <span class="occ">barrister and art collector</span>, born at Flintham Hall, Nottinghamshire, the home of his paternal uncle Lewis Disney, on 29 May 1779, was the eldest son of seven children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7685/', "Revd John Disney DD (1746&#150;1816)")</script>, a Church of England, and later Unitarian, clergyman, and his wife, Jane (1745/6&#150;1809), eldest daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2513/', "Ven. Francis Blackburne (1705&#150;1787)")</script>, rector of Richmond, Yorkshire, and archdeacon of Cleveland. The Disney family could trace its descent back to the Normans. The focus for the family was Norton D'Isney (Norton Disney) and Swinderby, both between Newark-on-Trent and Lincoln; Disney's father was vicar of Swinderby until he resigned his living in 1782.<br>
<br>In December 1782 the Disney family moved to London, when the Revd Disney became the first secretary of the Unitarian Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Scriptures. In 1783 he became minister of the Essex Street Chapel with the Revd Theophilus Lindsey. By 1785 the family had moved to Sloane Street in Chelsea, and Disney received his education at home. In April 1796 he was admitted, aged sixteen, as pensioner to Peterhouse, his father's Cambridge college; his younger brother Algernon (1780&#150;1848) followed him to Peterhouse in October of the same year. Two years later, in April 1798, Disney was admitted to the Inner Temple, following a legal career which his father had been forced to abandon through ill health. In May 1803 he was called to the bar. On 22 September 1802 he married, at St George's, Hanover Square, his first cousin Sophia (1777&#150;1856), youngest daughter of Lewis Disney-Ffytche (1738&#150;1822) of Swinderby, Lincolnshire, and Danbury Place, Essex, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Ffytche, governor of Bengal; there were three children of the marriage, John (1808&#150;1829), Edgar (1810&#150;1881), his successor, and Sophia.<br>
<br>Disney's family stayed in London until March 1805 when his father retired to The Hyde, near Ingatestone, Essex. The Hyde, designed by Sir William Chambers, had been bequeathed (in a will of 2 November 1792), along with land in Dorset at Corscombe, Halstock, and Netherstoke, by Thomas Brand Hollis (<i>d</i>. 1804), the friend of the &#145;republican&#146; Thomas Hollis (1720&#150;1774). In this way the Disney family acquired a significant income from both estates (estimated at about &pound;5000 a year) as well as the substantial collection of classical sculptures displayed at The Hyde which had been largely acquired, often through Thomas Jenkins in Rome, by Hollis and Brand during the grand tour in a series of journeys made from 1748 to 1753. The display included a portrait of Marcus Aurelius once in the Palazzo Barberini at Rome. Other pieces were acquired on their return to England, such as from the sale of Dr Richard Mead's antiquities. This Dorset interest may have influenced Disney's appointment in September 1807 as recorder of Bridport, a position he held until 1823; in 1818 he was appointed sheriff of Dorset. During this period he resided at Corscombe.<br>
<br>On the death of his father, on 26 December 1816, Disney inherited The Hyde and its contents, as well as land in Dorset. One of his first actions was to dispose of the libraries of his father, Thomas Hollis, and Thomas Brand Hollis at Sothebys, on 22 April 1817. He also seems to have taken more interest in affairs in Essex and about 1820 sold part of his Halstock estate; in 1822 his wife inherited part of the estate of her father (and Disney's uncle).<br>
<br>In 1818 Disney started work on a major catalogue of the collection of antiquities at The Hyde; an earlier catalogue of the collection, <span class="italic">A Catalogue of some Marbles, Bronzes, Pictures and Gems, at The Hyde, Near Ingatestone, Essex</span> (1807), had been prepared by his father. A study by the Revd James Tate of the inscriptions in the collection was added to the second impression (1809) after a visit to The Hyde in August 1809. The collection itself was supplemented by small antiquities from Pompeii and Herculaneum acquired by a relative during a visit to Italy between 1795 and 1798. Disney's research was interrupted by a visit to Italy and in particular Rome in 1826 and 1827, during which time he made a number of purchases. He found Italy disappointing, writing to C. Rankin, his agent, from Rome, &#145;the country round the Eternal City is &hellip; as dreary and desolate as Hounslow heath was 30 years ago&#146;  (Disney to Rankin, 17 Dec 1826, Chelmsford, Essex RO, MSD/DQC 211). He also received gifts of antiquities from Charles Callis Western and James Christie. Among his acquisitions was a Latin inscription said to have been found in March 1821 on the site of the County Hospital at Colchester, but almost certainly purchased abroad. Disney was active in local societies. He was president of the Chelmsford Philosophical Society and instrumental in the creation of the Chelmsford and Essex Museum, which moved to new premises in 1843. He was the first president of the Essex Archaeological Society, founded in 1852.<br>
<br>After relinquishing his position in Dorset, Disney continued to pursue his legal interests and published <span class="italic">Outlines of a Penal Code</span> (1826). By 1832 he was chairman of the quarter sessions of the justices of the peace for the county of Essex. He seems to have had a long-standing desire to become a member of parliament. He edited a work entitled <span class="italic">A collection of acts of parliament, relative to county and borough elections, with reference to several reported cases, containing the determinations of the House of Commons</span> (1811), and contested the constituencies of Harwich (1832) and North Essex as a Liberal candidate, but without success. During the 1835 campaign he had to defend himself against the accusation that he supported whipping as &#145;a fit punishment for females&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 May 1835) as well as to suffer the re-airing of the celebrated 1815 scandal between his brother Algernon and Lady Cranstoun  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 May 1835). The expenses for these elections, as well as the upkeep of The Hyde, may have led Disney to dispose of the Corscombe estate in 1836.<br>
<br>The catalogue of The Hyde, illustrated with engravings, appeared in 1846 as <span class="italic">Museum Disneianum, being a description of a collection of ancient marbles, in the possession of John Disney, esq., F.R.S. F.S.A., at The Hyde, near Ingatestone</span>. A second edition followed in 1849 with supplements entitled, &#145;Specimens of ancient art&#146; (dated on a separate title page, 1848) and &#145;Various ancient fictile vases&#146; (dated on a separate title page, 1849). The volume subsequently appeared under a new title, <span class="italic">Fitzwilliam Museum</span>, reflecting Disney's donation of most of his collection of sculptures to the fledgeling Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge in 1850, initiating the Greek and Roman collection. Along with E. D. Clarke's collection of marbles, presented to the University of Cambridge in 1803, the Disney marbles continue to form the core of the Fitzwilliam's ancient sculpture collection. The remaining antiquities were left at The Hyde, and were subsequently dispersed at auction by Christies on 1 May 1884 and 28 January 1886 after the death of his son Edgar; in 1885 the Fitzwilliam acquired the marble <span class="italic">Apollo of Miletus</span>, restored under John Flaxman and Antonio d'Este. Adolf Michaelis commented that Disney showed &#145;more zeal than knowledge or criticism&#146; and that the collection itself was &#145;trash rather than treasure&#146;  (A. Michaelis, <span class="italic">Ancient Marbles in Great Britain</span>, 1882, 159). Disney's generosity to the University of Cambridge continued when in 1851 he gave an endowment of &pound;1000 to create a chair of archaeology, the first in Great Britain. The endowment was augmented to &pound;3500 by bequest. Disney specified in a deed of trust of 28 May 1851 that the Disney professor should lecture &#145;on the subject of Classical Mediaeval and other Antiquities the Fine Arts and all matters and things connected therewith&#146;  (Clark, 224). Disney reserved the right in his lifetime to make the appointment, and J. H. Marsden of St John's College was the first holder.<br>
<br>Disney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 9 June 1832; his nomination was supported by the traveller W. M. Leake, whose collection of Greek pottery and cabinet of coins and gems were also to find their way to the Fitzwilliam Museum. This was followed on 20 June 1839 by Disney's election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; he served on its council in 1845 and 1850, and acted as one of the auditors in 1850. He was awarded the honorary degree of DCL at the University of Oxford in 1854, and was incorporated with the degree of LLD at the University of Cambridge in the same year, an honour which he marked with the presentation of a bust of himself to the Fitzwilliam Museum. Disney died at The Hyde on 6 May 1857 and was buried with his wife in Fryerning churchyard, Essex.<br>
