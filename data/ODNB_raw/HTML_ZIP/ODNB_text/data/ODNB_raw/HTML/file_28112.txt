<span class="headword">Vardy,  John</span>  (1717/18&#150;1765), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Durham, where he was baptized on 20 February 1718. He was the second son of Ralph and Mary Vardy; his father was a labourer turned gardener, and John was one of at least seven children. He is next recorded in May 1736, when he was appointed clerk of the works at the Queen's House, Greenwich, at the age of only eighteen. There is no indication of how he made the transition as, unlike most of his colleagues in the office of works, his name does not appear in the records of any appropriate trade guilds. His subsequent official appointments were as clerk of the works at Hampton Court (1745&#150;6), at Whitehall, Westminster, and St James's (1746&#150;54), and at Kensington (1754&#150;61). In 1756 he was made clerk at Chelsea Hospital, and from 1749 to 1763 he was surveyor to the Royal Mint.<br>
<br>During the first ten years of his career Vardy seems to have established himself as an unofficial personal assistant to William Kent, preparing drawings for projects such as the Treasury building overlooking Horse Guards Parade (begun in 1733) and the Houses of Parliament. In 1741 he drew and engraved Kent's gothick pulpit design for York Minster, and three years later he made his sole venture into publishing with a volume of fifty plates entitled <span class="italic">Some Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones and Mr. William Kent</span>, thirty-three of which were devoted to buildings, furniture, vases, and other artefacts by the latter architect. Vardy performed a particular service both to contemporaries and to posterity by including the gothick court of king's bench and Gloucester Cathedral choir screen, as well as engraving separately the gothicized Esher Place. Apart from Batty Langley's <span class="italic">Gothic Architecture Improved</span> (published initially in 1741&#150;2), these were the earliest appearances in print of the new gothick style.<br>
<br>In his official capacity Vardy was responsible (jointly with William Robinson) for supervising the posthumous execution of Kent's scheme for the Horse Guards in Whitehall (1750&#150;59), and for designing the &#145;new stone building&#146; at Westminster as accommodation for the king's bench records and exchequer bill offices: designed in 1753, it was partly realized in 1755&#150;8, finally completed in 1821, and demolished in 1883. His 1748 design for a new royal palace in Whitehall (exhibited 1761) is not known to have survived.<br>
<br>Like his office of works colleagues Isaac Ware and Henry Flitcroft, Vardy was essentially an architectural civil servant whose reputation rests mainly on private commissions, though most of these have been demolished or altered. His style, in both classical and gothick idioms, was formed by his close contact with Kent. This is seen in his earliest datable independent project, an unexecuted design (1746) for a four-towered mansion for the Hon. Richard Arundell, and in his design (1754; also unexecuted) for a British museum, the one indebted to Holkham, the other to Kent's parliament schemes. His classical designs are generally in a restrained Palladian manner, as with Milton (later Dorchester) House, Park Lane (<i>c</i>.1751; dem. 1849) for Baron Milton, first earl of Dorchester; Woodcote Park, Epsom, Surrey, a stylistically attributable design of the 1750s for Frederick Calvert, the sixth Baron Baltimore (burnt 1934 and rebuilt); and the remodelling of Hackwood Park in Hampshire for the fifth duke of Bolton (<i>c</i>.1761&#150;3; altered out of recognition in 1805&#150;13). However, fashionable rococo leanings can be detected in some of his garden building designs, in the plasterwork he designed for the interior of Milton House, and in his furniture designs for Hackwood and elsewhere. For Milton Abbey in Dorset he offered his client, Lord Milton, both Palladian and gothick options; work seems to have been started on the gothick scheme in 1753, but it was left unfinished and subsequently replaced by a house designed by Sir William Chambers. At Spencer House overlooking Green Park, London (1755&#150;60, for the first Earl Spencer), the exterior and ground-floor rooms were completed to Vardy's Palladian scheme, but for the first-floor rooms he was superseded by the neo-classicist James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart, despite his own attempts to introduce neo-classical motifs to his designs.<br>
<br>Vardy died in London on 17 May 1765 at the age of forty-seven. His will, which shows him to have been comfortably off, with property in Derby Street, Westminster, and Egham, Surrey, mentions his wife (whose name is not given), brother Thomas (a carver who executed his furniture designs), daughters Margaret and Elisabeth, and sons Edward and John; to the last (also an architect) he left &#145;all my books, drawings, instruments and matters relating to architecture&#146;.<br>
