<span class="headword">Thackeray,  Frederick Rennell</span>  (1775&#150;1860), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the third son of Frederick Thackeray (1737&#150;1782), physician, of Windsor, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of Abel Aldridge of Uxbridge, was born in Windsor, Berkshire, and baptized on 16 November 1775. His father's sister was the wife of Major James Rennell of the Bengal Engineers, the geographer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27154/', "George Thackeray")</script> was his younger brother, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27155/', "William Makepeace Thackeray")</script>, the novelist, his first cousin once removed.<br>
<br>After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Thackeray was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 18 September 1793, and was transferred to the Royal Engineers on 1 January 1794. He served at Gibraltar from 1793 until 1797, when he went to the West Indies, having been promoted first lieutenant on 18 June 1796. He took part, on 20 August 1799, in the capture of Surinam under Sir Thomas Trigge. In 1801 he was aide-de-camp to Trigge at the capture of the Swedish West Indian island of St Bartholomew on 21 March, the Dutch island of St Martin on 24 March, the Danish islands of St Thomas and St John on 28 March, and Santa Cruz on 31 March.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1801 Thackeray was promoted second captain. He returned to England in 1802, and in 1803 went again to Gibraltar. He was promoted first captain on 1 March 1805, and again returned to England. In February 1807 he was sent to Sicily, and joined the expedition under Major-General McKenzie Fraser to Egypt; he returned to Sicily in September. In 1809 Thackeray was commanding royal engineer with the force under Lieutenant-Colonel Haviland Smith detached by Sir John Stuart (when he made his expedition to the Bay of Naples) from Messina on 11 June to make a diversion by an attack on the castle of Scylla. The siege was directed by Thackeray with such skill that, although raised by a superior force of French, the castle was untenable, and had to be blown up.<br>
<br>In March 1810 Thackeray was sent from Messina by Sir John Stuart with an ample supply of engineer and artillery stores to join Colonel John Oswald in the Ionian Islands, to besiege the fortress of Santa Maura. Its position on a long narrow isthmus of sand made it difficult of approach, and it was well supplied and contained casemated barracks sufficient for its garrison of 800 men under General Camus. Oswald landed on 23 March. No enfilading batteries could be erected; but after the British direct batteries had opened fire the siege works were pushed gradually forwards, until on 15 April Thackeray pointed out the necessity for carrying by assault an advanced trench held by the enemy which would enable him to reconnoitre the approach to, and the position for, the breaching battery, and he proposed to turn the trench, when taken, into an advanced parallel of the attack. The operation was carried out successfully; the enemy were driven out of the trench at the point of the bayonet by Lieutenant-Colonel Moore of the 35th regiment; large working parties were at once sent in, and, by Thackeray's judicious and indefatigable exertion, the trench on the morning of 16 April 1810 was converted into a lodgement from which the attackers could not be driven by the fire of the enemy, while the British infantry and sharpshooters were able so greatly to harry the artillery of the place that in the course of the day it surrendered. Thackeray was mentioned in dispatches. Oswald also wrote to thank him. Thackeray received on 19 May 1810 a brevet majority in special recognition of his services.<br>
<br>Thackeray sailed in July 1812 with the Anglo-Sicilian army under Lieutenant-General Frederick Maitland, and landed at Alicante in August. He took part in the operations of this army, which, after Maitland's resignation in October, was successively commanded by Generals Mackenzie, William Clinton, Campbell, and Sir John Murray, who arrived in February 1813. On 6 March Thackeray marched with the allied army from Alicante to attack Suchet, and was at the capture of Alcoy. He took part in the battle of Castalla on 13 April, when Suchet was defeated. On 31 May he embarked with the 14,000 strong army, which carried a powerful siege train and ample engineer stores, for Tarragona, where they disembarked on 3 June. Thackeray directed the siege operations, and on 8 June a practicable breach was made in Fort Royal, an outwork. Thackeray objected to an assault on this work before everything was ready for the construction of a parallel and advance from it. All was prepared on 11 June, and instructions were given for an assault after a vigorous bombardment. But Murray, having received intelligence of a French advance, counter-ordered the assault and raised the siege. For this he was court-martialled at Winchester, and found guilty of an error of judgement. Murray seems at the time of the siege to have blamed Thackeray for delaying the attack, for on the arrival of Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck to take command on 18 June, Thackeray wrote to him indicating that an attempt had been made to attach blame to him for the termination of the siege of Tarragona, and requesting Lord William as an act of justice to investigate his conduct before Sir John Murray left, and while all the relevant persons were still present. This letter was sent to Murray, who exonerated Thackeray  (reply of Murray, dated Alicante, 22 June).<br>
<br>Thackeray was promoted lieutenant-colonel, Royal Engineers, on 21 July 1813. He had moved, at the end of June, with Lord William Bentinck's army to Alicante, and was at the occupation of Valencia on 9 July, and at the investment of Tarragona on 30 July. He took part in the other operations of the army under Bentinck and his successor, Sir William Clinton. During October and November Thackeray was employed in rendering Tarragona once more defensible. In April 1814, by Wellington's orders, Clinton's army was broken up, and Thackeray returned to England in ill health.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1815 Thackeray was appointed commanding royal engineer at Plymouth; in May 1817 he was transferred to Gravesend, and on 26 November 1824 he went to Edinburgh as commanding royal engineer of Scotland. He was promoted colonel in the Royal Engineers on 2 June 1825, and was made a CB, military division, on 26 September 1831. In 1833 he was appointed commanding royal engineer in Ireland. He was promoted major-general on 10 January 1837, when he ceased to be employed. He had married at Rosehill, Hampshire, on 21 November 1825, Elizabeth Margaret Carnegie, third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4719/', "William Carnegie, seventh earl of Northesk")</script>; they had three sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>Thackeray was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers on 29 April 1846, was promoted lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846, and general on 20 June 1854. He died at his residence, The Cedars, Windlesham, Bagshot, Surrey, on 19 September 1860, and was buried at York Town, Farnborough, Hampshire. Thackeray's wife and children survived him.<br>
