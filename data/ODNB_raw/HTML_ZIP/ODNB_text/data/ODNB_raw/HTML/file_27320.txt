<span class="headword">Thomson,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">philologist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the Netherlands of one English parent, the other, and most likely his mother, probably being a native of Brabant. Popularly known, therefore, as Dutch Thomson upon migrating to England, he matriculated as sizar at Clare College, Cambridge, on 26 June 1583, and proceeded BA in 1587 and MA in 1591. He was subsequently made a fellow of the same college, and in 1612 became senior proctor, in addition to being incorporated into Oxford University on 1 July 1596.<br>
<br>It appears that Thomson never married, but he had at least one brother, Emmanuel. In 1612 Thomson was presented by Lancelot Andrewes, bishop of Ely, to the rectory of Snailwell, Cambridgeshire. He relied on the patronage of Sir Robert Killigrew and Sir Henry Savile during the early part of his career. About 1610 Thomson, along with Augustine Lindsell, helped Richard Mountague with his edition of Gregory of Nazianzus. His continued reputation in England as a philologist was enough for him to be selected as one of the translators of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span>, working with Andrewes and John Overall on the first Westminster committee responsible for translating <span class="roman">Genesis</span> to <span class="roman">2 Kings</span>. However, according to Mountague, he was &#145;better knowne in Italy, France, and Germany, than at home&#146;  (Montagu, 126). Thomson's wide circle of friends and his international reputation are reflected in the surviving correspondence of William Camden, Janus Gruterus, the librarian to Heidelberg University, Isaac Casaubon, Joseph Scaliger, Hugo Grotius, and Dominicus Baudius of Leiden University.<br>
<br>Yet as the &#145;diligent Auditor, and familiar&#146; of Overall  (Plaifere, 22), Thomson also made a number of enemies due to his strongly held Arminian convictions. It appears that he was in the habit of making frequent visits to the Netherlands (for example, he visited Leiden in 1594) and in 1605 he was one of the few Englishmen who could speak of a personal acquaintance with Jacobus Arminius. In January 1611 Casaubon spent a day with Thomson in Killigrew's country house, where he read Petrus Bertius's recently published <span class="italic">De sanctorum apostasia problemata duo</span> (1610). The copy of this notorious Dutch Arminian work was furnished by Thomson, who also showed Casaubon the manuscript of his own <span class="italic">Diatriba de amissione et intercisione gratiae, et justificationis</span>, which maintained the same basic position as Bertius. Thomson's treatise was refused an English licence in the late 1590s, and Overall arranged for it to be published posthumously at Leiden in 1616 and 1618. In this book Thomson argued that a man who was truly justified by faith may not always remain justified but could fall from grace entirely. The reprobate could be in Christ and justified, but then be cut off. As for the elect, although they finally persevered, this did not mean to say that they could not temporarily lose their faith and hence lose their justification also. To receive saving or justifying grace was not necessarily, therefore, to receive salvation. The refutation of this book, by Robert Abbot, bishop of Salisbury, published in 1618 and 1619 in both London and Frankfurt, <span class="italic">De gratia, et perseverantia sanctorum</span>, dismissed it as a mixture of Roman Catholic, Arminian, and philosophical error.<br>
<br>Although Thomson laid himself open to the charge of Romanizing, he still held the pope to be Antichrist, as the only book he published during his own lifetime, <span class="italic">Elenchus refutationis torturae torti pro reverendissimo in Christo patre domino episcopo eliense, adversus Martinum Becanum Jesuitam</span> (1611), makes plain. The entire book, dedicated to Sir Thomas Jermyn, was written against Jesuits in defence of Andrewes's case for the oath of allegiance. It was the charge of Arminianism, however, that was to stick the most. George Carleton, bishop of Chichester, associated Thomson with the Anti-Calvinists William Barret and Peter Baro in disturbing the prevailing &#145;uniformity in doctrine&#146; and being justly &#145;refuted and rejected&#146; by the Church of England  (Carleton, 8&#150;10). According to Thomas Hill, these men were &#145;a new brood of such as did assert Arminianisme&#146;  (Fenner, sig. A4<i>v</i>). Peter Heylyn also associated Thomson with the doctrines of Arminius, the remonstrants, William Laud, John Howson, and John Richardson. Thomson's presbyterian opponents tended to reject him on moral grounds as well as doctrinal ones. William Prynne described him as a &#145;dissolute, ebrious, prophane, luxurious&#146; and &#145;deboist drunken English-Dutchman, who seldome went one night to bed sober&#146;  (Prynne, 268, fol. *4<i>r</i>). William Barlee wrote of him as &#145;Drunken dick Thomson, a man bewitched with the Conceit of his own parts as much as any Babylonian intoxicated by the Cup of the Whore&#146;  (Barlee, 26). Following in the same vein Henry Hickman also described Thomson's Arminianism. Allegedly, &#145;when men reproved him for his prophaness he would say, &#147;My will is free, I am a Child of the Devil to day; to morrow I will make my self a Child of God&#148;&#146;  (Hickman, 227). Thomson died in 1613 and was buried at St Edward's Church, Cambridge, on 8 January.<br>
