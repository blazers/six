<span class="headword">Burnet, Sir  John James</span>  (1857&#150;1938), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Glasgow on 31 March 1857, the youngest of the three sons of John Burnet (1814&#150;1901), a successful architect, and his formidable wife, Elizabeth Hay Bennet. He was educated at the Western Academy, Glasgow, and at Blair Lodge. In 1874 he joined the atelier of Jean-Louis Pascal in Paris and in 1875 was the first of several Glasgow architects to enrol at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts. He gained the Dipl&ocirc;me du Gouvernement in 1877 and toured Italy thereafter. On his return he won the competition for the Glasgow Institute of Fine Art with a sophisticated design combining &#145;Greek with modern French Renaissance&#146;. It demonstrated the absolute mastery of plan and elevation, the precise stonecutting, and the love of sculpture which were to distinguish almost all his work.<br>
<br>In 1882 Burnet's father took him into partnership. Four years later another Pascal <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ve</i>, John Archibald Campbell (1859&#150;1909), rejoined them, and the firm became Burnet, Son, and Campbell: the work of the two younger partners was to remain indistinguishable until Campbell set up on his own in 1897. The major works of these earlier years were all very Beaux-Arts in style: the Clyde Navigation Trust (1883&#150;6), the Athenaeum (1886), Charing Cross Mansions (1891), all in Glasgow, and the Edinburgh International Exhibition of 1886. But in 1891 at Glasgow's Athenaeum Theatre Burnet began introducing the American elevator building types which were to be copied by others throughout central Glasgow, and moved into a Norman Shaw type of neo-baroque. American and Shaw influences had already been in evidence in his domestic work, notably at Kilneiss, Moniaive, Dumfriesshire (1884), and Corrienessan, Loch Ard, Perthshire (1887).<br>
<br>Burnet's Gothic work was also of exceptional quality: his tall first-pointed Barony Church, Glasgow (1886&#150;99), was among the finest of the period. More innovative, however, were the low-profiled, rather American churches with broad unbuttressed towers, sweeping roofs, and mixed late Gothic and Romanesque motifs first introduced at St Molio's, Shiskine, Arran, in 1886, the finest of which was the Gardner Memorial at Brechin, Forfarshire, built ten years later. In the same period Burnet designed several buildings at Glasgow University and the associated Western Infirmary, mostly in a Scottish Renaissance idiom, for which he was rewarded with the honorary degree of LLD in 1910. In 1913 the university commissioned its tall and magnificent chapel, built as its war memorial in 1923&#150;7.<br>
<br>In 1896 Burnet made the first of several visits to the United States of America (where his brother-in-law James Marwick had useful connections in Illinois and New York), primarily to study laboratory and hospital design. It quickly had wider consequences: his reconstruction of his father's Savings Bank, Glasgow (1898), continuing a programme of aggrandizement begun with the superb banking hall of 1894, reflected his acquaintance with Charles Follen McKim; but his subsequent seven-storey commercial blocks, Atlantic Chambers and Waterloo Chambers (both 1899) and the McGeoch warehouse (1904&#150;6), all in Glasgow, were pioneer buildings of their kind in Britain and demonstrated a wider range of influences, particularly those of Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan. These were followed by two Edinburgh department stores, the Civil Service and Professional Supply (1903&#150;7) and Forsyths (1906&#150;10), the latter of which was the first Scottish building to be fully steel-framed. All of these were vigorously neo-baroque in style, with deeply shadowed eaves galleries. They launched the careers of a number of important sculptors, notably George Frampton, Albert Hodge, Phyllis Archibald, William Reid Dick, and Archibald Dawson.<br>
<br>Burnet's domestic commissions of the late 1880s, 1890s, and early 1900s were mostly terraced houses, principally in his University Gardens, Glasgow (from 1887), or remodellings of existing houses, notably Carronvale, Larbert, Stirlingshire (1897), and Finlaystone, Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire (1898&#150;1903), both with sumptuous interiors. The three large houses he built completely anew&#151;Garmoyle, Dumbarton, and Baronald, Lanark (both 1889&#150;90), and Fairnilee, Selkirk (1904&#150;6)&#151;were in an innovative early seventeenth-century Scottish manner: Garmoyle anticipated Lorimer in its arts and crafts masonry. At the Marine Hotel, Elie, Fife (1903), however, an asymmetrically gabled Anglo-American arts and crafts idiom was adopted. At Duart, Mull, Argyll (1911&#150;16), the ancient fortress was re-roofed and skilfully adapted within its existing profile for Sir Fitzroy MacLean.<br>
<br>In 1903&#150;4 the office of works and the trustees of the British Museum selected Burnet to design the Edward VII galleries. Burnet's scheme adopted the Ionic order of Sir Robert Smirke's colonnades but reflected contemporary French and American Beaux-Arts ideas. His giant colonnade of twenty attached columns stretched between pylons demonstrated every possible &#145;subtlety of varying diameter, intercolumniation, and inclination of verticals&#146; to achieve absolute refinement and repose (W. H. Godfrey, quoted in J. Mordaunt Crook, <span class="italic">The British Museum</span>, 1972, 214). Within, the stair was unmatched for its scale and originality. The completion of the galleries in 1914 brought Burnet a knighthood and the bronze medal of the Paris Salon, followed by the gold in 1922; the Royal Institute of British Architects conferred on him its royal gold medal in 1923. In parallel with this cascade of honours Burnet, who had been an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy since 1893, was elected Royal Scottish Academician in 1914, associate of the Royal Academy in 1921, and Royal Academician in 1925.<br>
<br>To build the Edward VII galleries Burnet had established a London office in 1905, taking with him Thomas Smith Tait and recruiting a trusted former assistant, the classical scholar David Theodore Fyfe. The Glasgow office continued separately, from 1909 in partnership with the Paris-trained Norman Aitken Dick (1883&#150;1948). The major London commissions of the pre-war years were the baroque General Accident Building, Aldwych (1909&#150;11), and the classical modern Kodak Building, Kingsway (1910&#150;11), in the latter of which Tait had a hand, and which set the pattern for a great many inter-war commercial buildings. Kodak showed the influence of the American architect Albert Kahn, even more strongly reflected in Glasgow at the Wallace Scott Tailoring Institute of 1913&#150;22.<br>
<br>Tait was taken into partnership after the war. Together Burnet and Tait did much work for the Imperial War Graves Commission in the Middle East, notably at Port Taufiq, Cape Helles, Gallipoli, and Jerusalem. In London they designed the very American Adelaide House, London Bridge (1921&#150;5), the modern French classical Vigo House, Regent Street (1920&#150;25), and the more conservatively Corinthian Lloyds Bank, Cornhill (1925&#150;7), and Unilever House (1929&#150;32). Burnet exercised tighter design control in Glasgow, notably at the city's war memorial, the university's zoology building (1923), and the giant American palazzo of the North British and Mercantile Company (1925&#150;7). In 1926 he was appointed to the original international jury for the League of Nations Building: he voted for the Roman architect Giuseppe Vago. The second jury (1927&#150;9) voted for the design by Burnet's friend and mentor at Pascal's, Henri-Paul N&eacute;not, but appointed him in association with Vago and two other prize-winners, Carlo Broggi and Camille Lefevre; N&eacute;not consulted with Burnet on the radically revised design which resulted from this complex arrangement.<br>
<br>In person Burnet was a courteous Frenchified Scot with a firm belief in the Beaux-Arts &#145;essentials&#146; and &#145;classics&#146;, and his international outlook was reflected in numerous corresponding memberships. The last decades of his life, and that of his wife, Jean Watt (1864&#150;1949), the daughter of Sir James David Marwick, whom he had married on 18 February 1886, were somewhat difficult. Although possessed of great charm, Lady Burnet was a hypochondriac, and the couple had no children. Burnet suffered acutely from eczema and had to wear a skull-cap and gloves. War, perfectionism, a major theft of sums held on behalf of contractors, and a structural error (the last two both in the Glasgow office) had seriously damaged his finances when ill health obliged him to retire in 1930. Thereafter he moved to Woodhall Cottage, Woodhall Road, Colinton, Edinburgh, where he died on 2 July 1938. He was cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 5 July 1938. His wife survived him. A bronze bust of Burnet by Sir William Reid Dick is in the possession of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.<br>
