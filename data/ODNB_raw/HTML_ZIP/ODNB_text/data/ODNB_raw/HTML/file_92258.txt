</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Raine,  Kathleen Jessie</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet and literary scholar</span>, was born on 14 June 1908 at 6 Gordon Road, Ilford, Essex, the only child of George Raine, schoolmaster and Methodist lay preacher, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkie. Her mother was Scottish and her first language Scots, a cultural inheritance that Raine regarded as key to the early &#145;language of my imagination&#146;  (Cookson, 56). It was her mother who introduced her to the Romantic poets and who would recite <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> at the kitchen sink. Raine's father, an English teacher, also helped cultivate his daughter's nascent poetic sensibility. Declining to follow his father into the mines, he had written a thesis on Wordsworth at Durham University (where he met his wife) and would conduct regular visits to performances of Shakespeare at the London theatres.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriagesandearlypoems"></a>Education, marriages, and early poems</h2>Raine would later come to resent the dreary indifference of her early environment, associating London's encroaching suburbs with the forces of a relentlessly advancing materialism which threatened all higher thought and finer feeling. If, as she put it, &#145;I was born in exile&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 80783A), she discovered her true home in the untamed beauty of Northumberland, where she spent the First World War with her mother's first cousin, Penny Black. It was this landscape which would inspire in her an enduringly Romantic belief in the numinous quality of nature and, through it, in man's capacity for spiritual enlightenment and creativity.<br>
<br>After the war Raine returned to continue her education in Ilford where, aged fourteen, she fell deeply in love with a youth five years her senior whom she agreed to marry when she herself turned nineteen. Her father ended the relationship&#151;and with it, she reflected, &#145;my brief, sad womanhood, never to be restored&#146;  (&#145;Love, Cambridge, poetry&#146;, <span class="italic">PN Review</span>, 37). She won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, in 1926 to read natural sciences. Her botanical interests would ensure that her poems were strewn with flowers; her fascination with Jung would give them symbolic resonance. Cambridge, from which she graduated in 1929 with a third in psychology, brought her into contact with a wide circle of aspiring writers and artists, including Malcolm Lowry, Humphrey Jennings, Jacob Bronowski, and William Empson, the last two publishing her early poems in an undergraduate magazine, <span class="italic">Experiment</span>&#151;possibly because &#145;they thought I was pretty&#146;  (&#145;Kathleen Raine in conversation with Grevel Lindop&#146;, <span class="italic">PN Review</span>, 39).<br>
<br>Empson later needled his friend to &#145;give up thinking you are Robert Graves' Ancient Murderous Bitch Goddess&#146;  (BL, Raine papers). Raine had indeed been regarded as the great beauty of her generation at Cambridge and this physical allure, combined with her clear-eyed quest for spiritual truth, proved a heady combination for many young men. One such was a gifted fellow student and surrealist poet, Hugh Sykes Davies (1909&#150;1984), the son of Thomas Seaton Davies, Wesleyan minister, and a cousin of the art historian Herbert Read. They married on 26 August 1930, following Raine's fruitless attempt to secure a job at the Hogarth Press with Virginia Woolf (whom she had seen delivering her famous lecture &#145;A room of one's own&#146; at Girton). The marriage&#151;a result, by her own admission, of not knowing what else to do&#151;lasted &#145;briefly and forgettably&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>), ending in divorce.<br>
<br>By 1932 Raine had settled in Blackheath, on the outskirts of London, with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57883/', "Charles Henry Madge (1912&#150;1996)")</script>, a poet, sociologist, and founder of Mass-Observation. They had two children, Anna (<i>b</i>. 1934) and James (<i>b</i>. 1936), and married on 22 December 1937, but this union also foundered and the marriage was dissolved. Raine had meanwhile fallen for Alastair MacDonald (referred to only by his forename in her published writings), a Cambridge contemporary and &#145;the handsomest Scot I have ever seen&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 80783A). Reflecting on the relationship later, in the confessional diary of 1951&#150;2 she addressed to her mentor, Elias Canetti, she revealed that Alastair embodied for her &#145;lost Scotland&#146;; and that she &#145;would have pretended to be Mrs Macdonald of Surbiton, so desperately did I desire him sexually&#146;  (ibid.). Her resolve to resist carnal temptation lay behind her decision to join the Catholic church: &#145;a very high price to pay and the worst thing I have ever done, a betrayal of all I honour in heaven and on earth. Still, it served its purpose, and I escaped the siren somehow&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War MacDonald enlisted, and Raine retreated with her children, first to her mother's beach hut in Devon and thence to Penrith, Cumberland, at the invitation of the poet Michael Roberts and his wife, Janet Adam Smith, who as literary editor of <span class="italic">The Listener</span> had published some of Raine's earliest poems. She then spent a year in Martindale by Ullswater, Cumberland. In late 1941 she moved back to London, leaving her young children temporarily in the care of Helen Sutherland at Cockley Moor, &#145;too young and too soon&#146; as she later ruefully saw  (<span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 212). In London she worked briefly in the Ministry of Information, then on a social survey, and then, in the latter stages of the war, in the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office. Nevertheless she returned frequently to Cumberland over the next twenty years, meeting many in the artistic set presided over by Helen Sutherland, including the poet Norman Nicholson, the artist Winifred Nicholson, and the artist and poet David Jones (about whom she later wrote with great sensitivity).<h2>
<a name="TambimuttuandGavinMaxwell"></a>Tambimuttu and Gavin Maxwell</h2>Charles Madge had introduced Raine to the charismatic and chaotic poet and editor Tambimuttu, who had arrived penniless from Ceylon in 1938 to stir up bohemian London, and it was &#145;Tambi&#146; who now agreed to take up Raine's cause following the rejection of her work by T. S. Eliot. The neo-romantic flavour of his magazine, <span class="italic">Poetry (London)</span>, together with the mercurial style of the man himself (whose claim to royal descent Raine believed and whom she admired to the end), appealed to poets seeking to move from the strictures of early high modernism on the one hand and the political preoccupations of the Auden set on the other. Raine became a regular contributor and was profiled in the magazine shortly before Tambimuttu published her first book in 1943, under his Editions Poetry London imprint. <span class="italic">Stone and Flower: Poems 1935&#150;1943</span> was illustrated by Barbara Hepworth and attracted positive attention. &#145;I want to give an enthusiastic if ignorant howl in your direction&#146;, Graham Greene wrote to her, &#145;Poems like <span class="roman">Good Friday</span> I had already seen &amp; admired, but I hadn't realised the quantity of the quality as it were&#146;  (BL, Raine papers).<br>
<br>By 1949 Raine had published two further volumes and now embarked on the most significant and turbulent relationship of her life. Tambimuttu brought to her Chelsea home the artist, explorer, and shark fisherman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34959/', "Gavin Maxwell (1914&#150;1969)")</script>, introducing them by taking their photograph under a pear tree in the garden. Maxwell seemed everything for which Raine, a professed exile from her true geographic and social inheritance, had been searching. As a grandson of the duke of Northumberland he had aristocratic roots tapping deep into the land she regarded as her earthly paradise. At church, her mother had sat behind his, &#145;admiring her coils of shining hair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 274). She had played on the earth and swum in the water owned by his family. &#145;Gavin belonged&#146;, as she put it, &#145;to my own people in the country lost before I was born&#146;  (ibid., 270).<br>
<br>Raine once told Canetti &#145;the deepest truth I am capable of telling about myself, that I consider&#151;not my beauty,&#151;but the quality of my sexual love&#151;so high that I have never found any man whom I could consider worthy of it&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 80783A). She found this paragon in Maxwell, believing that to marry him &#145;would be the most wonderful thing in the world, something as sacred as Christmas, or sunrise, something unimaginable&#146;  (ibid.). Nevertheless, Maxwell's homosexuality rendered the dream impossible. He once kissed her passionately on the mouth and she once spent the night in his arms, but the relationship went unconsummated and she remained celibate for the rest of her life. Her deepest wish could be fulfilled only in the realms of poetry, something well understood by Maxwell himself, whose most famous work took its title from her poem of 1952, &#145;The Marriage of Psyche&#146;: &#145;He has married me with a ring, a ring of bright water / whose ripples travel from the heart of the sea.&#146;<br>
<br>Raine's growing resentment stemmed from more than just physical denial. She felt that Maxwell's mother had rejected her and that he regarded her as ill-bred, pushing her as a consequence to the edge of his life. It was in July 1956, while staying at his house at Sandaig on the west highland coast, that this sense of hurt brought the affair to an end of mythic high drama. After a period away Maxwell arrived back home with a friend to discover Raine still ensconced, an unexpected guest who had outstayed her welcome. He summarily banished her from his hearth and, after wandering distractedly through the storm-lashed night, she unleashed a curse under the nearby rowan tree which had earlier symbolized an almost magical happiness: &#145;let Gavin suffer, in this place, as I am suffering now!&#146;  (Botting, 218). Maxwell soon afterwards suffered the death of his pet otter, Mij, and in January 1968 the destruction of his house by fire, in which perished another otter, Edal, the subject of his famous book. In April 1968 (four years after the collapse of his marriage to a much younger woman) he wrote to Raine, &#145;whether or not your curse has been responsible for this terrible disaster I don't know and shall never know&#146;  (BL, Raine papers). A year later, in what was to be his last letter, he informed her that he had inoperable cancer. Although he assured her that &#145;your spirit accompanies me&#146;  (ibid.), Raine never forgave herself this litany of misfortune, and two autograph notebooks in the British Library document her use of mediums in a quest for resolution.<h2>
<a name="Maturepoetryandliterarycriticism"></a>Mature poetry and literary criticism</h2>In 1954 Raine secured a five-year research fellowship at Girton. There she continued to publish verse, Philip Larkin praising her <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> of 1956 as &#145;vatic and universal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), while launching herself into study of William Blake and W. B. Yeats. Her writings on these and other figures working in a metaphysical or visionary tradition (including Plotinus, Jacob Boehme, Emanuel Swedenborg, and Thomas Taylor) established her as a critic of major importance. <span class="italic">Blake and Tradition</span> (1968) perhaps stands as her most notable achievement, while her collection of essays, <span class="italic">Defending Ancient Springs</span> (1969), illustrates the essential and insistent theme behind her neo-Platonic thinking: that there exists an imaginative, spiritual realm apprehensible to true poets, thinkers, and artists across the ages through an eternal language of symbols; and that, importantly, these sacred groves must be defended against the contrary forces of secular materialism and all its social, political, and intellectual symptoms, chief among them Freudianism, Marxism, socialism, behaviourism, logical positivism, feminism (men were the only true visionaries), and, latterly, post-modernism. A major review of the book in the <span class="italic">TLS</span> found much to admire in her &#145;impassioned diatribe against the intellectual idols of Philistia's market-place. Out flashed that keen critical sword, and kitchen-sink telly-drama bites the dust amid our latter-day dark Satanic mills&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 11 July 1968). G. B. Shaw, Jean Genet, and Arnold Wesker were all targets.<br>
<br>Raine's literary opinions could be astonishingly dismissive. During a trip to New York with David Gascoyne and W. S. Graham in 1951 John Berryman told her that he believed W. H. Auden to be a great poet. &#145;If he is&#146;, she replied, &#145;you can keep him&#146;  (BL Add. MS 80783A). Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">Death of a Salesman</span> she considered the &#145;popular rock-bottom of American Society&#146;  (ibid.), while in the visual arts Ben Nicholson's abstraction was mere &#145;rubbish&#146;  (&#145;Kathleen Raine in conversation with Grevel Lindop&#146;, <span class="italic">PN Review</span>, 40). Among the notable contemporaries she rated highly were T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound (whom she visited in his confinement), Marianne Moore, and later on Ted Hughes, whose <span class="italic">Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being</span> (1992) was the only work of literary criticism she would suffer to have on her shelves. Raine, in turn, attracted her share of critical censure over the years. The philosopher Ray Monk found &#145;transcendental twaddle aplenty&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 27 Dec 1991) in her three gathered volumes of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span> (1991).<br>
<br>By 1968 Raine commanded a sufficiently senior literary standing to campaign for Oxford University's professorship of poetry (losing, much to her chagrin, to Roy Fuller). John Betjeman wrote telling her that he felt she, instead of him, should have been appointed poet laureate in 1972&#151;&#145;I could not v. well turn down a good offer&#146;  (BL, Raine papers)&#151;and in the same year a collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Lost Country</span>, won the W. H. Smith award. Raine's reputation also grew strongly in France.<h2>
<a name="Highpriestessofmysticism"></a>High priestess of mysticism</h2>Raine's home, 47 Paultons Square in Chelsea, became the centre of a genteel counter-culture and it was from there in 1981 that she and like-minded others launched <span class="italic">Temenos</span>, a review in which poets and artists such as Cecil Collins, Peter Redgrove, and Vernon Watkins, as well as Raine herself, sought to restore an imaginative vitality to the arts&#151;atrophied, as she saw it, by modernity.<br>
<br>In 1990 Raine launched the Temenos Academy with the patronage of the prince of Wales, to whom she had been introduced by Laurens van der Post and on whom, by his own admission, she would have an important emotional and intellectual impact. Beginning its work in the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in Regent's Park, Temenos, and from 1998 the associated <span class="italic">Temenos Academy Review</span> (the successor to <span class="italic">Temenos</span>, whose thirteenth and final issue had appeared in 1992), vociferously promoted the cause of spirituality and imagination in a modern age chill with secular humanism. Although declaredly universal in approach, a particular theme of interest to emerge was the mystical and religious traditions of the East, a reflection of Raine's own increasing preoccupation with the subject, especially following her own trips to India undertaken in the latter years of her life and written about in the fourth and final volume of her autobiography, <span class="italic">India Seen Afar</span> (1990).<br>
<br>In the last decade of her life, Raine perhaps captured some of the long-lost happiness she associated with her early years in Northumberland and Scotland. India felt for her &#145;home at last&#146;  (Cookson, 58) while such honours as the queen's gold medal for poetry in 1992 and appointment as CBE in 2000 were generally, but not always, received with satisfied good grace. In 1991 she refused an invitation from the Royal Society of Literature to become one of its ten companions of literature, considering other recipients, like Iris Murdoch and Anthony Burgess, no better than &#145;journalists&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 April 1992). Many of her late poems, tinged with regret, express a great welling of love for her family.<br>
<br>Raine was engaging, attractive, and always immaculate in a tweed suit. She could be abrasive and arrogant, but was kind and generous to many people, both obscure and highly distinguished. Despite her determination to fight the &#145;Great Battle&#146; on imagination's behalf, she was practical and canny, negotiating good terms for the sales of artworks and her own manuscript material, invariably to support some needy poet. She hated almost all television (Kenneth Clark's <span class="italic">Civilization</span> was a rare exception) but listened to the radio, sharing a three-barred fire with her cat in an elegantly cluttered front room adorned with painted inscriptions by David Jones and overlooked by a photograph of Tambimuttu.<br>
<br>Raine was knocked down by a car while posting a letter at the end of her street and died on 6 July 2003 from resulting complications in the nearby Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. At a service of thanksgiving for her life at the Queen's Chapel, St James's Palace, on 4 December 2003, Prince Charles delivered a remarkable eulogy, quoting freely from her many letters to him.<br>
