<span class="headword">Beldam,  Asplan</span>  (1841&#150;1912), <span class="occ">marine engineer</span>, was born in Bluntisham, Huntingdonshire, on 5 October 1841, the eldest son in the family of eleven children of William Beldam, farmer and victualler, and his wife, Mary Peat. After serving an apprenticeship with Kitson, Thompson, and Hewitson, locomotive engineers in Leeds, he turned to marine engineering and from 1864 to 1869 gained experience with several shipbuilding firms on the Thames. From 1870 to 1873 he was outside manager at G. Forrester &amp; Co.'s Vauxhall foundry, Liverpool, where he had charge of repairs to vessels and the fitting out of new ships.<br>
<br>By the time Beldam left Liverpool in 1873 he had been appointed consulting and superintending engineer to a number of shipping companies, including the Flower Line, the Castle Line, and the Eastern Telegraph Company. One particularly notable vessel which he designed was the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, famed for her speed, for example, when in 1882 she brought home a cargo of 6000 tons of China tea from Hangchow (Hangzhou) in twenty-eight days, beating the previous best time by more than a week.<br>
<br>From 1873 to 1876 Beldam acted as marine superintendent with Hargrove, Fergusson, and Jackson, for whom he constructed both ships and machinery, striving always to achieve greater power, efficiency, and economy. During this time he developed and patented several new types of high-pressure steam boiler as well as making improvements to steam-tight glands, valves for pumps, and anti-clinkering fire bars.<br>
<br>By 1876 the growing interest in his metallic asbestos packing encouraged Beldam to patent it and found the Beldam Packing and Rubber Company, which later became Beldam Crossley. At the same time he set up in practice as a consulting engineer and naval architect in London, where he remained until his death. Beldam took a leading part in the formation of the Institute of Marine Engineers and was elected the first president in 1889. He continued to take a very active interest in its affairs, and he was also a member of the institutions of Mechanical Engineers (1888) and Naval Architects and of the London chamber of commerce. His advice and opinion as an arbitrator were frequently sought, his fair and impartial judgement being held in high esteem.<br>
<br>Beldam married, at Deptford on 9 February 1863, Elizabeth Hannah Knowles (1842/3&#150;1921), daughter of George Wood Knowles. They had eleven children; their two sons both went to Cambridge University before entering the family business, of which they later became directors. He died suddenly at his residence, Torrens House, North Common Road, Ealing Common, London, on 16 December 1912.<br>
