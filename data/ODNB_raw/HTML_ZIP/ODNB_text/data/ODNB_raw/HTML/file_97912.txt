<span class="headword">Kempster,  John</span>  (1836&#150;1916), <span class="occ">police journalist and temperance campaigner</span>, was born in Congleton, Cheshire, on 3 April 1836, the son of John Joseph James Kempster, a minister in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Captain Joseph Westbeech RN.<br>
<br>After attending schools at Norwich, Ramsgate, and Hatfield, Kempster was apprenticed to a firm of stationers in Norwich and then became a traveller for Jarrolds, Norwich, supplying stationery and books to schools. On 5 June 1860 he married Eliza, daughter of Thomas Jennings, baker, of Milton, Cambridgeshire; they had a son and a daughter. At the time of his marriage he was in business as an auctioneer and estate agent in Norwich. He went on to set himself up as a supplier of school books in Birmingham, where he was subsequently appointed&#151;at the instance of Sir Josiah Mason&#151;general manager to the Educational Trading Company. From at least 1868 he also managed, in London, a partnership supplying books and a patented school desk to the growing elementary education sector. His career did not follow any consistent business trajectory: &#145;ordinary routine &hellip; did not appeal to him unless, as in the case connected with some reform, he was really interested in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 12 January 1917).<br>
<br>In 1877, following the discovery of serious fraud at a firm that since 1867 had purchased land in London to provide housing to working-class families, Kempster was appointed emergency secretary of the Artizans', Labourers', and General Dwellings Company. Between July 1877 and March 1878 he rescued the company. His ability reassured investors (Ruskin quoted one of Kempster's circulars in <span class="italic">Fors Clavigera</span>) and helped to prevent any flight of capital after the prosecution of the former secretary, William Swindlehurst, and chairman, Baxter Langley, at the Old Bailey in October 1878, and the sentencing of each to eighteen months' hard labour. On the appointment of a new secretary from April 1878, Kempster was elected to the board and remained an active member until his death, becoming also a director of the Temperance Building Society. The Artizans' Company was, from 1890, the largest supplier of social housing in London until overtaken by the London county council in 1905.<br>
<br>Kempster, favouring total abstinence and local option, was also a stalwart of the temperance movement. He held senior London office in the United Kingdom Alliance, and various posts in the Grand Lodge of Good Templars, a body founded on masonic lines in New York in 1851 and planted in Birmingham from 1870 by Joseph Malins. At his own expense Kempster founded, edited, and published the <span class="italic">Good Templar's Watchword</span> from 1874. He spoke publicly for these causes (representing the Templars in an important arbitration case) and in 1892 organized a vast temperance procession to Hyde Park. In addition he supported the Liberation Society, the leading nonconformist pressure group favouring separation of state and religion, and served on its executive council in the 1890s. He stood as a Gladstonian Liberal parliamentary candidate for Enfield (1885), North Paddington (1886), West Staffordshire (1892), and Clapham (1895), all unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>In 1882 Kempster took over from an ailing relative the role of reporter for <span class="italic">The Times</span> at the chief metropolitan magistrates' court at Bow Street. This threw him into contact with officers of the Metropolitan Police whose terms and conditions of service attracted his campaigning interest. The growth of trade unionism drew attention to the absence of any form of collective representation for policemen, who were allowed to vote in national elections only from 1887, and who had no guaranteed pensions until 1890. A demonstration by Metropolitan officers at Bow Street that year was met with instant dismissal.<br>
<br>Kempster was impressed by the extent to which the board schools had begun to produce a more educated and thoughtful officer. In 1892 he conceived the notion of a campaigning newspaper addressed to police officers, previous police journalism having been of modest reach. In the hope of gaining the support of senior police management, he floated his ideas to the Metropolitan commissioner, Edward Bradford: &#145;I need hardly state that I should desire to conduct it on such terms as would secure the entire approval of the ruling authorities&#146;  (14 Sept 1892, TNA: PRO, MEPO 2/9170). Bradford received him but gave him no encouragement. When Kempster launched the <span class="italic">Police Review and Parade Gossip</span> in January 1893, the first number reassured the authorities that no subversive agitation was intended.<br>
<br>Though initially a drain on his capital, the venture proved successful. In its first year the <span class="italic">Police Review</span> campaigned in support of the MP Charles Schwann's bill to permit policemen to vote in local elections too, and gained credit when it passed. It went on to publish police-specific news, championed police professionalism over the importing of gentry outsiders into chief officer posts, opened lively correspondence columns, and included instructional articles relevant to police professional knowledge.<br>
<br>Kempster also undertook two notable campaigns, one successful but the other with few immediate results in his lifetime. The first was in favour of guaranteeing policemen a weekly rest day as a right rather than as a matter of&#151;often fickle&#151;grace. Since policemen had no representative organization, Kempster in 1908 effectively spoke for them to the parliamentary committee that examined the question and recommended a change in the law on the lines for which Kempster had argued, in a model of well-organized lobbying. After the passage of the <span class="roman">Police (Weekly Rest-Day) Act</span> 1910 he was rewarded with a public testimonial occasion presided over by the archbishop of Canterbury, when he was presented with an inscribed gold watch and a purse of &pound;250.<br>
<br>The second campaign did not produce an outcome until after Kempster's death, although the discussion he fostered did much to influence its shape. The question was whether the police should be allowed to form a representative body and, if so, of what character. At a time of general labour unrest this debate presented acute challenges to the police authorities: unaccountable to their workforces, they had ruled in a despotic and at times capricious manner. Kempster's initial approach was to found the Police and Citizen's Association (chaired by Charles Schwann but run by Kempster) as a way of holding police authorities to account. Its aims prioritized improved educational advantages for the police, competitive promotion, and the provision of legal assistance, but did not espouse any form of unionism. Although Kempster put much effort into the association and it claimed success in championing some grievances, the association could not become a police membership organization without official approval, and that was never forthcoming.<br>
<br>For a period from 1910 Kempster supported the struggles of John Syme, the inspector dismissed from the Metropolitan police, who campaigned against what he called chief officer &#145;tyranny&#146;. Kempster's enthusiasm waned in the face of Syme's egotism and after the <span class="italic">Police Review</span> lost a libel action brought by Syme's erstwhile superiors. In early 1914 he disavowed Syme entirely after Syme and his colleagues at what became the National Union of Police and Prison Officers indulged in extreme vituperation. Seeking a more measured debate, Kempster tried to explore means of representation that were not threatening to the authorities and yet acceptable to policemen:<blockquote>There cannot be a permanent denial of this Human Right; and to say that it would interfere with the disciplinary requirements of any public service is to betray an ignorance of the first principles and strongest claims of good government. (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 2 Jan 1914, 7)</blockquote>Although Kempster died before the police strike that led to the establishment of the Police Federation, that body was formed on the lines of the &#145;representative committees&#146; he had suggested.<br>
<br>Kempster, whose red hair whitened with age, died on 13 December 1916 at his home, Westbeech, Bridge Lane, Hendon, Middlesex, an active magistrate almost to the end. Malins praised Kempster's temperance work, observing also that &#145;His <span class="italic">Police Review</span> brought its own reward, for it made his fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Good Templar's Watchword</span>, 23 Dec 1916, 445). Of his two children, his son John Westbeech Kempster (1864&#150;1947) became managing director of Harland and Wolf, the Belfast shipbuilders, and his daughter Eveline married David R. Harris, principal of the Bangor Normal College, Caernarvonshire, who became chairman of the <span class="italic">Police Review</span>. In a slightly tart obituary the <span class="italic">Police Review</span> described Kempster's<blockquote>combative instinct of nonconformity with any rule, habit or institution that seemed to him to be wrong, or to block the road to progress &hellip; Indeed, he was too apt to assume that those in authority were wrong, and the underdog right. Frequently this was correct, or mainly so, but not invariably. (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 12 Jan 1917, 12&#150;13)</blockquote>Kempster represents what nonconformist political activism could achieve against established interests and contribute to the evolution of more democratic forms in British society. The standards that he set in the <span class="italic">Police Review</span> for the public discussion of policing issues established it as an intelligent forum for instruction and reflection within the police service at a crucial time in the development of that service's self-consciousness and professionalism.<br>
