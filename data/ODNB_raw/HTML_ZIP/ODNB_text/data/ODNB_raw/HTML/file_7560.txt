<span class="headword">Deusdedit</span> <span class="st"> [St Deusdedit, Frithona]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 664), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, succeeded Honorius in March 655, after a vacancy of almost eighteen months. A West Saxon, consecrated by Ithamar, bishop of Rochester, he was the first English holder of the see. His Latin name, like that of his immediate predecessor, was that of a recent pope. It was clearly an adopted one, and in this he followed the practice of other early native English bishops. According to Goscelin of Canterbury in the late eleventh century, followed by Thomas of Elmham in the early fifteenth, Deusdedit's English name was Frithona.<br>
<br>Deusdedit consecrated Ithamar's successor, the South Saxon Damian, bishop of Rochester. He died on the same day, 14 July 664, as King Eorcenberht of Kent, probably as a result of an epidemic of plague. Little else is known about him. His episcopate seems to have coincided with a low point in Canterbury's influence, and it is not even certain that he was represented at the important Synod of Whitby, held to settle a uniform method for the calculation of Easter. Apart from Damian, Deusdedit seems to have consecrated few if any bishops; candidates for important sees such as Wine at Winchester and Wilfrid at York sought consecration abroad. At his death there remained only one English bishop who had been canonically ordained. Bede's statement that Theodore, who acceded to Canterbury in 669, was the first archbishop whom the whole English church consented to obey, clearly implies that Deusdedit's authority was limited. Such influence as he had was probably largely confined to Canterbury, where his successor Wigheard was drawn from his clergy, and to Canterbury's dependent see of Rochester.<br>
<br>Deusdedit was buried with his predecessors in the <i>porticus</i> of St Gregory in the abbey church of St Peter and St Paul, Canterbury (later St Augustine's). There are limited signs of a cult. He was commemorated on 15 July in the calendar of the Bosworth psalter (almost certainly produced at St Augustine's between 988 and 1022). His remains, and those of his five predecessors, were translated to new tombs at the east end of the new abbey church of St Augustine in 1091. Goscelin composed a life of Deusdedit based on Bede as part of the literature associated with the 1091 translations, and mass propers for the feast day were probably also compiled at this time.<br>
