<span class="headword">Bewley,  Joshua</span>  (1819&#150;1900), <span class="occ">tea and coffee merchant</span>, was born on 19 January 1819, the youngest child in the family of thirteen children of Samuel Bewley (1764&#150;1837), silk merchant, of Rockville, co. Dublin, and his wife, Elizabeth (1771&#150;1848), daughter of Nehemiah Fayle of Limerick. The Bewleys were a leading Irish Quaker family, descended from Mungo Bewley of Woodhall, who left Cumberland in 1700 and settled in Edenderry, co. Offaly, at a time when many Quakers from the Lake District were emigrating to Ireland. By the end of the eighteenth century there were Bewleys in Dublin, several of whom became tea merchants. Samuel Bewley imported silk from the Levant and Italy, and from 1826 had his own ships, involved in trade with Barbados. He was an influential member of the Dublin chamber of commerce, which put pressure on parliament to end the East India Company's monopoly over the China tea trade. The monopoly was removed in 1833, and from the following year the China trade was open to all. In February 1835 Samuel Bewley and his son Charles imported 2099 chests of tea in their ship the <i>Hellas</i>, the first to sail directly from China to Ireland. This was followed by another Bewley ship, the <i>Mandarin</i>, which arrived in Ireland in August 1835 with 8623 chests of tea.<br>
<br>In 1840, three years after his father's death, Joshua Bewley opened the China Tea Company, later Charles Bewley &amp; Co., a small business in Sycamore Alley, off Dame Street, in Dublin, dealing in tea. On 18 July 1845 he married Margaret Hanks Fisher, daughter of Joseph John Fisher of Youghal, co. Cork, and she became the driving force behind the business, joined in time by their two sons, Charles and Ernest. Although the main business was importing and blending tea, they also dealt in coffee and sugar, and the Bewleys maintained a fleet of horse-drawn carts and drays to make deliveries to customers outside Dublin. A strict Quaker, Bewley closed the shop on Thursday mornings to enable his staff to attend worship at the Eustace Street Quaker meeting-house. In the mid-1870s he moved the business to South Great George Street. After Charles emigrated to New Zealand, Ernest Bewley (<i>d</i>. 1932) took over much of the running of the business, and it was he who developed its reputation as a coffee merchant. In order to increase sales, in 1894 he organized coffee-making demonstrations at the back of the shop, and in 1896 bought 10 Westmoreland Street and opened the first Bewley's caf&eacute;, serving coffee and tea with cakes and buns. This became a regular haunt of James Joyce and other literary figures, including Patrick Kavanagh and Brendan Behan.<br>
<br>Joshua Bewley died on 21 September 1900 and was interred in Dublin's Temple Hill burial-ground. Ernest Bewley then took over the business. In 1900 he bought 19/20 Fleet Street, and opened a second caf&eacute;. Because of his fondness for oriental decoration, he began to import Chinese ware, including coffee sets and trays for the caf&eacute;s, and in 1926 changed the company's name to Bewleys Oriental Caf&eacute;s Ltd. In 1927 he opened a third caf&eacute; at 78/9 Grafton Street, and commissioned the stained-glass artist Harry Clarke to design the windows. The Bewley's caf&eacute;s on Westmoreland and Grafton streets became a Dublin institution but were closed in November 2004. The company had earlier been bought by Campbell Catering, and the Campbell Bewley Group was established in 1990 specializing in catering and the hotel trade.<br>
