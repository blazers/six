</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Strudwick,  John Melhuish</span>  (1849&#150;1937), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Clapham on 6 May 1849, the fifth child of William Strudwick (1808&#150;1861), grocer, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Melhuish (1811&#150;1861). On leaving St Saviour's Grammar School, Clapham, he studied at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, and, subsequently, the Royal Academy Schools, where he was enrolled as a probationer on 18 January 1868. Despite being undistinguished as a student he was first taken up by the well-known Scottish academician John Pettie before discovering the allure of the later Pre-Raphaelite school headed by Edward Burne-Jones.<br>
<br>Although chiefly recalled in accounts of the lives and works of the wider Pre-Raphaelite circle as a studio assistant to both John Roddam Spencer Stanhope and Burne-Jones, Strudwick enjoyed success as a painter in his own right. He became well known in London for a type of painting fashionable in aesthetic movement circles featuring allegorical, literary, or mythological themes. His most notable successes were at the Grosvenor Gallery, which opened in 1877, where he was in the company of such distinguished artists as J. A. McN. Whistler. His allegory on destiny, <span class="italic">The Golden Thread</span> (exh. Grosvenor Gallery, 1885; Tate collection), was bought by the Chantrey Bequest for the National Gallery of British Art. He became a regular exhibitor at the New Gallery on its foundation in 1888.<br>
<br>Strudwick absorbed many influences from both Spencer Stanhope and Burne-Jones, particularly in the high degree of finish of his canvases and the use of decorative detail. His use of colour is restrained yet harmonious; its faintly gleaming quality is one of the more distinctive and appealing characteristics of his work. If Burne-Jones's compositions displayed more elegance, the two artists shared a lack of animation in their principal figures. Strudwick's heroines seem rapt in a world of tragic or momentous feeling which they barely have the strength to register on their faces. Similarly, the winged figures that populate his works seem depressed rather than comforting.<br>
<br>Strudwick's pictures demonstrate an enthusiasm for the works of early Italian artists shared by other followers of the Pre-Raphaelites for whom the examples of Botticelli (<i>c</i>.1445&#150;1510), Crivelli (<i>c</i>.1435&#150;<i>c</i>.1495), and Mantegna (<i>c</i>.1431&#150;1506) provided an alternative to the realistic tendency of much contemporary art. As a result Strudwick's main works resemble altarpieces, although his subjects were more often concerned with art and literature than religion. His works are close in style to those of his contemporary Evelyn Pickering De Morgan, although his allegories have none of the campaigning zeal of hers.<br>
<br>Along with other artists connected to the wider aesthetic movement Strudwick exhibited several paintings depicting musical themes, among them his sole Royal Academy exhibit <span class="italic">Song without Words</span> (1876). Other examples include <span class="italic">A Symphony</span> (1903; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">When Apples were Golden</span> (1906; Manchester City Art Gallery). His <span class="italic">St Cecilia</span> (1897; Sudley House, Liverpool), commissioned by the Liverpool shipowner George Holt, lacks any of the erotic tension of Rossetti's famous design for Edward Moxon's edition of Tennyson's poems in 1857. An attendant angelic figure watches Cecilia with an anxious sympathy while the saint herself stares intensely, her hands frozen over the keyboard of a musical instrument.<br>
<br>William Michael Rossetti reviewed Strudwick's allegorical composition <span class="italic">Passing Days</span> when exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1878, and observed that the artist had &#145;produced here a picture with an ample sufficiency of appropriate and well-worked-out thought&#146;. He added: &#145;Making fair allowance for a painter at an early stage of his career, we can join with Mr. Strudwick's eulogists: not that we think his style perfection, or his idea a portent of profundity, but that he is thoughtful, diligent and artist-like&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Academy</span>, 1 June 1878, 494&#150;5). Despite such restrained praise Strudwick's work enjoyed a degree of popular attention for most of a generation. He was particularly fortunate in finding wealthy patrons for his works. Significantly several Liverpool merchants and shipowners, including Joseph Beausire, George Holt, and William Imrie, commissioned paintings from him for their sumptuous homes built or refurbished in the 1890s.<br>
<br>The most comprehensive overview of Strudwick's work published during his lifetime was by George Bernard Shaw in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (April 1891, 97&#150;102). Shaw identified a &#145;transcendent expressiveness&#146; as the &#145;moving quality&#146; in Strudwick's works, observing that &#145;persons who are fully sensitive to it will take almost as a matter of course the charm of the architecture, the bits of landscape, the elaborately beautiful foliage, the ornamental accessories of all sorts, which would distinguish them even in a gallery of early Italian painting&#146;. Much of Shaw's appraisal of the artist was mined by Percy Bate for the second edition of his formative book <span class="italic">The English Pre-Raphaelite Painters: their Associates and Successors</span> (1901), which included an assessment of Strudwick's work in relation to &#145;the Rossetti tradition&#146;. Nevertheless, by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century Strudwick's popularity had declined abruptly; he ceased to exhibit and abandoned painting altogether. When the reassessment of Pre-Raphaelite art began in the 1960s his work continued to be overlooked. At the end of the twentieth century, however, there was a noticeable reawakening of interest in his works reflected in the high prices they fetched at auction. His paintings began to be re-evaluated by collectors, if not by art historians, and appreciated for their beauty as objects, their craft, and meticulous detail, rather than for the somewhat obvious pictorial allegories that the artist laboriously set out on canvas.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1879 Strudwick married Harriet (1856&#150;1941), daughter of William Reed, cab driver. They had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62339/', "Ethel Strudwick")</script>, who became a distinguished educator. The Strudwicks had begun their married life in Edith Villas, Hammersmith (where they lived in the house previously occupied by John Butler Yeats, the Irish Pre-Raphaelite painter), but moved to the more fashionably artistic Marlborough Crescent, Bedford Park, in 1899. They returned to Hammersmith in 1927 to settle with their daughter in the arts and crafts house erected for the high mistress of St Paul's School for Girls in Rowan Road, Brook Green. Strudwick died there on 16 July 1937 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. An obituarist commented that he &#145;must have been the last of the Pre-Raphaelites&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 July 1937, 18).<br>
