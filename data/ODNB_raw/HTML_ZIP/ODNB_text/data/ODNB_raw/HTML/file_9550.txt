<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  George</span>, sixteenth earl of Kildare  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was baptized on 23 January 1612, the third but only surviving son and heir of Thomas Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1619), second son of William Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Kildare, and Frances (1576&#150;1618), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23122/', "Thomas Randolph")</script>, postmaster-general and chamberlain of the exchequer in England under Queen Elizabeth. His diminutive stature (as portrayed in his portrait, painted in 1632, at Carton) earned him the nickname the Fairy Earl. In 1620 he became heir to the premier earldom in Ireland on the death of his eight-year-old cousin Gerald, the fifteenth earl. George succeeded to an Irish inheritance that teetered on the brink of bankruptcy (by 1624 the earldom was allegedly hardly worth &pound;900 per annum). A series of minorities and encroachments from local speculators had ravaged it, as had jointures and other obligations, particularly to the eleventh earl's granddaughter, Lettice, who had been created Lady Offaly and enjoyed extensive estates in King's county, which encumbered it.<br>
<br>Thanks to the survival of the Kildare letter-book (1628&#150;37) in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, the earl's early life is remarkably well documented. James VI and I held the young earl's wardship and awarded it to his own kinsman, the third duke of Lennox. With the duke's death in 1624 the wardship passed to his widow and in 1629 she discussed the possibility of marrying Kildare to one of the daughters of the first earl of Antrim. Elizabeth Nugent, the widow of Gerald, fourteenth earl of Kildare, a fervent Catholic and patron of the Jesuits, warmly supported this match. However, Charles I was determined to isolate Kildare from the influence of his Irish relatives and their Catholicism and instead dispatched the youth in 1629 to Christ Church, Oxford. The king also approved the proposal of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3133/', "Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork")</script>, to take over Kildare's wardship (in return for a payment of &pound;6600 to the duchess of Lennox), to revive the family fortunes and to &#145;employ all my best endeavours, to reduce [the lineage] to its former lustre&#146;  (PRONI, D3078/3/1/5, 3). This and the subsequent marriage (15 August 1630) of Kildare to the earl's daughter Joan (1611&#150;1656), should be seen as a component of Cork's wider social, political and territorial ambitions to enrich his own pedigree, to consolidate his influence over Fitzgerald patrimonies in Ireland, and to tap into Kildare's patronage networks at court. True to his word, Cork challenged rival claimants to the Kildare patrimony (including Lady Offaly and the dowager countess of Kildare), began to redeem the numerous mortgages on the estate, rebuilt the earl's seat at Maynooth and the neighbouring chapel (completed in 1634), and provided the castle with expensive and exquisite furnishings.<br>
<br>On Lady Cork's death in 1630 her son-in-law was lauded as:<blockquote>
<div>Renown'd Kildare prime earl of this our Isle,<br>
</div>
<div>Whose auncient race, and still continued stile<br>
</div>
<div>Of honour, vertue, valour,<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Musarum lachrym</span>, [6])</blockquote>but Kildare's relations with Cork became increasingly sour especially after he came of age in January 1633 (special livery to his lands was granted on 20 February). Kildare's continued affection for his Catholic kin (including the dowager countess of Kildare), and his extravagance and financial recklessness infuriated Cork who complained that Kildare led &#145;the most licentious, prodigal and profuse way of life that ever [a] noble man did&#146;  (Canny, 50). The earl's support for Sir Piers Crosby, who had publicly crossed swords with lord lieutenant Thomas Wentworth, his decision to travel to London without a licence, and his refusal to disclose property titles in relation to a legal suit with Lord Digby also earned him the enmity of the lord deputy and a spell in prison (between 1637 and 1638). Despite this, Kildare befriended James Shirley the dramatist during his visit to Dublin, who then dedicated to him his tragi-comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Royal Master</span>, which was performed in Dublin in 1638.<br>
<br>Kildare took his seat in the House of Lords in 1640 (as he had done in 1634) and with the outbreak of the 1641 rising he became governor of co. Kildare. Despite repeated overtures from the insurgents who, according to his wife, &#145;sent many times to my lord to desire him to come and live amongst them, and they would put him in possession of all his lands&#146;, he remained loyal to the protestant cause  (Grosart, 4.267&#150;8). In retaliation they burned in February 1642 Kildare's &#145;new house at Maynooth&#146;, after pillaging his livestock and his household goods, including &#145;divers bookes out of the earles studye&#146;  (deposition of William Vowelle, TCD, MS 813, fols. 330<i>v</i>, 331<i>v</i>). With the death of Sir Charles Coote in May Kildare took over command of his regiment and despite speculations about &#145;how he will proceed against his countrymen&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Last Joyfull Newes from Ireland</span>, 1642, 3), he quickly became one of the &#145;strong pillars of the Protestant Army&#146;  (<span class="italic">The English and Scottish Protestants Happy Tryumph over the Rebels in Ireland</span>, 1642, 7). In January 1646 he stood bail for the royalist agent the marquess of Glamorgan, yet the following year acted as governor of Dublin under the parliamentarian colonel Michael Jones, and in 1649 he received a weekly pension of 46<i>s</i>. from the government. Imprisoned for debt in 1650 and again in 1655, Kildare petitioned the state for aid and relied for support on his brother-in-law, Lord Broghill, later earl of Orrery. With the death of his wife in 1656 (she was buried with her father in St Patrick's Cathedral) he appears to have retired to his castle at Kilkea, where he died early in 1660; he was buried alongside his ancestors at Kildare.<br>
<br>Kildare and his wife had three sons: Richard, Lord Offaly, who had died as a child; Wentworth (1634&#150;1664), who became the seventeenth earl; and Robert, grandfather of James, first duke of Leinster. Of their six daughters two died young, Catherine, &#145;a lady of great piety and virtue&#146;, died unmarried, and the remaining three wed local grandees (including the Clancartys)  (FitzGerald, 261). In 1655 Wentworth Fitzgerald married Lady Elizabeth Holles, a daughter of John, second earl of Clare (her marriage portion was &pound;6000) but his untimely death of a fever in 1664 and his wife's demise two years later left their young heir, John, at the mercy of other family members and his estates vulnerable to speculators. Despite the best efforts of the first earl of Cork and his sons to protect and promote the Fitzgerald lineage, an apparently congenital inability to produce an adult male who himself lived to see his son reach maturity once again threatened to undermine the survival of the ancient (and now protestant) house of Kildare.<br>
