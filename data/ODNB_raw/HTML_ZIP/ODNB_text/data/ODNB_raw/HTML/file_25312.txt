<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shelley,  Percy Bysshe</span>  (1792&#150;1822), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 4 August 1792 at Field Place, near Horsham in Sussex, the eldest son of Timothy, afterwards Sir Timothy Shelley, baronet (1753&#150;1844), and his wife, Elizabeth (1763&#150;1846), daughter of Charles Pilfold. He was baptized at Warnham, Sussex, on 7 September 1792.<h2>
<a name="17921811earlyyearsandeducation"></a>1792&#150;1811: early years and education</h2>Shelley had four younger sisters and one younger brother: Elizabeth (1794&#150;1831), to whom he was evidently close; Mary (1797&#150;1884); Hellen (1799&#150;1885), whose letters about Shelley's childhood, though written in the 1850s, are an invaluable mine of information (they are included in Hogg); Margaret (1801&#150;1887); and John (1806&#150;1866). The Shelley family had migrated to America in the person of the poet's great-grandfather Timothy (1700&#150;1771). His son Sir Bysshe Shelley (1731&#150;1815) returned to England, adding substantially to the family fortune and social status by two successive marriages, each involving elopement: the first with Mary Catherine Mitchell (1734&#150;1760, married 1752); the second with Elizabeth Jane Sidney (1741&#150;1781, married 1769).<br>
<br>Often Shelley is seen as something of a genetic mystery: where, it is asked, with his stolid background did he get his unique poetic genius? Perhaps his grandfather Sir Bysshe Shelley, a domineering figure, offers something of an answer. In a letter of 1812 Shelley wrote of him with distaste as &#145;a bad man&#146; and &#145;a curse on society&#146; for whom he &#145;never had respect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.239). Yet Shelley may have had more in common with his grandfather than he cared to notice. Edmund Blunden sees in a portrait of Sir Bysshe the depiction of &#145;a sort of mystic, who trusted in the discovery of truths less by system than by sudden light through the clouds&#146;  (Blunden, 18). Certainly Shelley inherited his intrepid courage and resoluteness.<br>
<br>The poet's father&#151;well-meaning, decent, and utterly conventional&#151;was a member of parliament for New Shoreham, a borough controlled by the duke of Norfolk, who was a supporter of the whig leader, Charles James Fox. Shelley grew up, therefore, in a climate sympathetic to whig notions of liberty, notions that had some influence on, even as they were outdone by, his mature political views; he assumed (as is witnessed by a letter he wrote to Leigh Hunt while at Oxford) that on attaining twenty-one he would enter public life, filling his father's seat  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.55). At the same time Shelley would have noticed, as Hunt points out in an incisive analysis of the &#145;Whig Aristocrats&#146; to whom the poet's family belonged, the gap between &#145;professed demands of what is right and noble&#146; and &#145;real inculcations of what is wrong and full of hypocrisy&#146;  (Holmes, 12&#150;13).<br>
<br>Shelley's mother is usually treated as a peripheral presence in his life. But there is a growing recognition that she (and the family dynamics of which she and her son were a central part) may well provide a key to understanding the poet's complex personality. Shelley was largely silent about her, and yet his poetry shows a strong concern with the relations between mother and child, as well as between father and child. To judge from scattered anecdotes and the portrait of her by George Romney painted in May 1795, Elizabeth Shelley was an attractive, somewhat formidable woman who took pride in her son's cleverness; she liked to talk of his learning by heart, after one reading, Gray's &#145;Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat&#146;. Shelley grew up in a largely female household, much admired by his sisters. Elizabeth left no record of her memories, but Hellen remembered her considerably older brother as &#145;full of cheerful fun&#146; if somewhat wild, telling his sisters stories of ghosts, alchemists, and the &#145;&#147;Great Tortoise&#148; that lived in Warnham Pond&#146;, and given to nocturnal walks, flights of fancy, and experiments involving &#145;electricity&#146;  (Hogg, 1.25, 22, 25, 23). There is a sense in poems such as the rhapsodic <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> (1821) that Shelley tries to create in imagination some equivalent to the emotional harmony he had known as a boy, the centre of female attention.<br>
<br>At the age of six Shelley went daily to the school run by the curate at Warnham, the Revd Evan Edwards. Here he began to learn Latin and Greek, languages of great importance for his poetic development; his father, thinking to make Shelley &#145;a good and gentlemanly Scholar&#146;  (Blunden, 12), no doubt hoped that a grounding in the classics would help his son's political career. When Shelley was ten he transferred to Syon House Academy, Isleworth, with his older cousin Thomas Medwin. The school was run by the Revd Dr Greenlaw and was not enjoyed by Shelley, who &#145;passed among his schoolfellows&#146;, according to Medwin, &#145;as a strange and unsocial being&#146;  (Mullan, 145). There is a drawing, probably of Shelley at this age, by Antoine-Philippe, duc de Montpensier. It shows a sensitive but determined face, with a strong nose, firm mouth, and calm eyes. At Syon House Shelley was teased and bullied, yet he found refuge from the traumas of school in reading Gothic romances. Here he attended lectures by Adam Walker on nature and science, which fired his imagination; the final act of <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> (1820) is the fruit of his passion for a type of scientific enquiry appropriately described as &#145;speculative and imaginative&#146;  (Holmes, 16).<br>
<br>In 1804 Shelley went to Eton College. There he was tormented, as at Syon House, by his fellows, especially in his early years at the school. The headmaster until 1809 was Dr Goodall, a jovial figure; in 1809 he gave way to his assistant John Keate, a sterner disciplinarian. At Eton, Shelley showed a characteristic refusal to submit to authority (he disliked the practice of fagging) as well as a capacity for anger in the face of injustice which stayed with him, for both good and ill. The poet who flayed political oppression in <span class="italic">The Mask of Anarchy</span> (1819) was also the young man who wrote some singularly violent letters to his father and sharply recriminating letters to his deserted first wife. One schoolfellow, W. H. Merle, recalled his response to the &#145;practical jokes&#146; to which he was subjected as &#145;a paroxysm of anger which made his eyes flash like a tiger's&#146;  (Blunden, 27). During his time at Eton, Shelley excelled in composing Latin verse; he translated half of Pliny's <span class="italic">Natural History</span>, and came into contact with Dr James Lind, a scholar who served as something of a mentor and father figure for Shelley. Indeed, his final years at school seem to have been relatively happy. He enjoyed walking in the vicinity of the school, and a friend, Halliday, recalled &#145;the sparkling poetry of his mind&#146; which &#145;shone out of his speaking eye, when he was dwelling on anything good or great&#146;  (ibid., 28). Shelley was still at Eton when he wrote and published a Gothic romance called <span class="italic">Zastrozzi</span> (Wilkie and Robinson, 1810). Like its successor <span class="italic">St Irvyne, or, The Rosicrucian</span> (published during Shelley's first term at Oxford by John Joseph Stockdale in December 1810, despite the 1811 date on its title-page), <span class="italic">Zastrozzi</span> attempts to cash in on the vogue for sensationalist fiction. But both novels warrant attention as looking ahead, in their concern with oppression, revolt, and subversion, to Shelley's more mature use of Gothic elements.<br>
<br>When Shelley went up to University College, Oxford, in 1810 he was already a published poet, the co-author with his sister Elizabeth of <span class="italic">Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire</span>, published by Stockdale in 1810 but withdrawn after the discovery that one poem had been plagiarized from Monk Lewis. (Shelley blamed Elizabeth for this.) Some lyrics addressed to Shelley's cousin Harriet Grove (1791&#150;1867), with whom he was in love, have an ease and grace that look ahead to much finer work, and hint at the metrical command characteristic of his mature writing. The budding love affair with Harriet Grove was a casualty of Shelley's increasingly fervent opposition to Christianity, an opposition which culminated in his expulsion from University College on 25 March 1811 after refusing to disavow authorship of <span class="italic">The Necessity of Atheism</span> (printed in Worthing by C. and W. Phillips in 1811). This work was co-written with Thomas Jefferson Hogg, who was also expelled, after insisting that he share Shelley's punishment. According to Hogg, Shelley was presented at his interview with a sentence of expulsion that had already been &#145;drawn up in due form, under the seal of the college&#146;  (Hogg, 1.169). Hogg was a fellow student at University College, and Shelley's closest friend at Oxford. In his <span class="italic">Life</span> he has left a vivid if mischievous portrait of Shelley the undergraduate: a poetic genius, intellectually brilliant, and devoted to liberty in all forms, and yet the object of the biographer's worldly amusement. Hogg likes to present Shelley as wildly eccentric, snatching a baby from its mother's arms on Magdalen Bridge to see whether it would &#145;tell us anything about pre-existence&#146;  (ibid., 1.147), or falling asleep in front of a fire &#145;like a cat&#146;  (ibid., 1.59) before waking up and plunging straightaway into argument or reciting verse. These anecdotes, like so many told about Shelley, seem at once melodramatic and to contain a germ of truth. Hogg also praises Shelley's &#145;pure, entire, and perfect gentility&#146;  (ibid., 1.130). This quality, blended &#145;intimately with his entire nature&#146;, was commented on by many of Shelley's friends: according to Byron &#145;Never did a more finished gentleman than Shelley step across a drawing-room!&#146;  (ibid.); for him Shelley was &#145;the most gentle, most amiable, and <i>least</i> worldly-minded person I ever met&#146;  (Cameron, 87).<br>
<br>Shelley found the university academically uninspiring, but he continued with his reading and scientific experiments. Hogg claims that he helped Shelley to compose the seemingly burlesque but covertly anti-establishment collection of poems, <span class="italic">Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson</span> (published by Munday in 1810), an early example of Shelley's ability to deploy humour for serious ends. If that work failed to stir suspicion, <span class="italic">The Necessity of Atheism</span> went out of its way to provoke: its nonchalant conclusion, &#145;Every reflecting mind must allow that there is no proof of the existence of a Deity. Q.E.D.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 5), was, in particular, designed to vex the bishops, heads of colleges, and clergymen to whom the authors sent their pamphlet, often under assumed names. <span class="italic">Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things</span>, also published by Munday, was advertised in the <span class="italic">Oxford University and City Herald</span> for 9 March 1811 as &#145;Just Published, Price Two Shillings&#146;. A copy of this poem, 172 lines of rhyming couplets, came to light in 2006; it was donated in 2015 to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and made available online (<span class="roman">Shelley's Poetical Essay</span>, 2015). The poem, attributed to &#145;A GENTLEMAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD&#146; and accompanied by a preface opposed to war and advocating &#145;gradual, yet decided intellectual exertions&#146;  (p. 6), is dedicated to Harriet Westbrook (1795&#150;1816), who would become Shelley's first wife, and has an epigraph from Southey's <span class="italic">The Curse of Kehama</span> about the horror of famine, plus a declaration that it was written for &#145;ASSISTING TO MAINTAIN IN PRISON, MR. PETER FINNERTY, IMPRISONED FOR A LIBEL&#146;. Finnerty was an Irish journalist, who, as a war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, reported in highly critical terms on a botched expedition to Walcheren in 1809 in which thousands of British soldiers died in a failed attempt to establish a line of attack against the French. He was later imprisoned for allegedly libelling Lord Castlereagh. Castlereagh, Finnerty claimed, had tried to suppress the latter's reports. Shelley's poem exhibits its radical leanings through its praise of the whig MP, Sir Francis Burdett, its echoes of Godwin, its attacks on war and &#145;Oppression&#146;, and its ardent libertarian rhetoric: &#145;Man must assert his native rights, must say / We take from Monarchs' hand the granted sway&#146;. There are fascinating anticipations of later poetry, especially but not only explicitly political productions such as <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> and <span class="italic">The Mask of Anarchy</span>. The elegiac mention of &#145;The sternly wise, the mildly good&#146;, for example, looks ahead to lines in &#145;Mont Blanc&#146; about the &#145;voice&#146; &#145;which the wise, and great, and good / Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel&#146;, the companion of &#145;awful doubt, or faith so mild&#146;. Burdett as a &#145;taintless emanation from the sky&#146; seems, momentarily, a forerunner of the dead Keats in <span class="italic">Adona&iuml;s</span>.<h2>
<a name="18111814firstmarriageandyouthfulwritings"></a>1811&#150;1814: first marriage and youthful writings</h2>The expulsion from Oxford heralded a difficult period in Shelley's life. He moved to London, taking lodgings with Hogg at 15 Poland Street. His relations with his father deteriorated as he resisted Sir Timothy's attempts to make him forswear his atheism. At a loss to know how to manage his wayward son, Sir Timothy placed responsibility for dealing with Shelley with his solicitor William Whitton. Shelley, meanwhile, embarked on a period of restless wandering and growing involvement in political agitation. In August of this year he eloped with and married Harriet Westbrook, a fellow pupil of his sisters at a school in Clapham. Harriet was the sixteen-year-old daughter of the well-off owner of a coffee house. In an age of sharp social divisions she would have been regarded as beneath Shelley, and it cannot have been lost on her parents and her considerably older sister Eliza (<i>b</i>. 1782), who would become one of Shelley's bitterest enemies, that a match between her and the heir to Field Place would have its advantages. Unhappy at her school, Harriet wrote plaintively to Shelley, who had gone in July to Cwm Elan in Radnorshire, the estate of his cousin Thomas Grove, and who was maintaining an impressive if high-flown correspondence with Elizabeth Hitchener, a Sussex schoolteacher known to his uncle Captain Pilfold. The young poet described to Hogg the gist of Harriet's most significant letter thus: &#145;she would fly with me, &amp; threw herself on my protection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.131). The couple eloped, arriving in Edinburgh on 28 August, where they were soon joined by Hogg, and, despite Shelley's objections to marriage as fettering free enquiry, were married the next day. It was to prove among the most fateful events in Shelley's life.<br>
<br>An immediate consequence was the breakdown of Shelley's relationship with his father, who cut off his allowance and ceased to communicate with his son. An indignant letter from Shelley to his father in October tells Sir Timothy, &#145;You have treated me <i>ill</i>, <i>vilely</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.149). Shelley had by this stage moved to 20 Coney Street, York. During this period his letters to his father oscillate between self-justification and an implicit desire for his father's approval. Late in October he visited Cuckfield, staying with Captain Pilfold, and causing considerable turmoil, partly by accusing his mother of having an affair with Edward Graham, a music teacher and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Shelley's parents. On his return to York, Shelley discovered that Hogg had taken his friend's anti-matrimonial beliefs with inappropriate literalness and had tried to seduce Harriet. Shelley's letters to Hogg from Keswick, to which he, Harriet, and Eliza Westbrook (who had joined Harriet in York during Shelley's absence) had now moved, declare love for and disapproval of Hogg in equal measure, and it is clear that he was devastated by the temporary breakdown of their friendship.<br>
<br>In Keswick, Shelley met and exchanged ideas with Robert Southey, who treated the young radical poet with sympathy and middle-aged scepticism: &#145;he has a very happy knack&#146;, Shelley wrote to Hitchener, &#145;when truth goes against him of saying, &#147;Ah! when you are as old as I am you will think with me&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.223). Shelley grew disenchanted with Southey, but the encounter made a powerful impact on both men. Shelley quotes Southey's remark that the younger man was &#145;not an Atheist but a Pantheist&#146;  (ibid., 1.219), while Southey, on whom Shelley acted as his &#145;own ghost&#146;, put Shelley &#145;upon a course of Berkeley&#146;  (ibid.), which led ultimately to Shelley's formulation of his own &#145;intellectual philosophy&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 477) in his essay &#145;On life&#146; (1819). Southey appears to have discussed Wordsworth with Shelley, who sent off to Hitchener an early version of what ended up as &#145;A Tale of Society as it is, from Facts&#146;, a poem that shows Wordsworthian influence in its plain diction and sensitive rhythms. This poem was included in a collection of his early work transcribed in the so-called &#145;Esdaile Notebook&#146;, which Shelley tried but failed to have published in 1813.<br>
<br>In January 1812 Shelley began a significant correspondence with William Godwin, the author of <span class="italic">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</span> (1793) and the poet's future father-in-law. <span class="italic">Political Justice</span>, which Shelley may have first read while still at Eton, exercised a durable influence over his mind: he told Godwin that it changed him from &#145;the votary of Romance&#146; into someone aware he &#145;had duties to perform&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.227&#150;8). Godwin's belief that human beings must be guided by rational self-rule and his faith in perfectibility pervade much of Shelley's mature work. Tension, however, as much as devotion is apparent in their relationship, and Shelley's visit to Ireland (February&#150;April 1812) in support of agitation to repeal the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> and secure Catholic emancipation was frowned on by his mentor, who preferred a quieter way of working towards a better world. Shelley wrote two pamphlets on Irish affairs, <span class="italic">An Address, to the Irish People</span>, aimed at poor Irish Catholics and energetically distributed by the young aristocrat, who threw copies at likely passers-by from his balcony in Sackville Street, and <span class="italic">Proposals for an Association of Philanthropists</span>, which is especially notable for its analysis of what went wrong with the French Revolution and for its commitment to the Godwinian belief that &#145;We are in a state of continually progressive improvement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 52). Shelley's involvement in Ireland's troubled politics was short-lived but more than merely farcical. At the very least, his efforts brought him up hard against the obdurate realities of specific political problems.<br>
<br>Finally responding to Godwin's objections, Shelley, Harriet, and Eliza departed from Dublin on 4 April to live in a variety of dwellings, first in Nantgwillt, Radnorshire, then, briefly, in June with the Groves at Cwm Elan where Shelley wrote &#145;The Retrospect&#146;, among his most accomplished and self-revealing earlier poems. By the end of June the party was living in Lynmouth in north Devon. Here Shelley completed and distributed his prose work <span class="italic">A Letter to Lord Ellenborough</span>, protesting against Lord Ellenborough's harsh sentencing (prison and pillory) of Daniel Isaac Eaton, a radical bookseller. With Elizabeth Hitchener, who joined the Shelley household in mid-July, he distributed copies of the revolutionary <span class="italic">A Declaration of Rights</span> and the broadsheet ballad &#145;The Devil's Walk&#146; by various means, including bottles thrown into the sea and even home-made fire balloons. In August Daniel Healey, Shelley's Irish servant, was arrested in Barnstaple for posting copies of <span class="italic">A Declaration of Rights</span> and imprisoned for six months, an event which brought Shelley's radical activities to the attention of the Home Office. The decision was taken not to prosecute Shelley for his seditious behaviour, but to have him watched. In the meantime, however, Shelley, with his female companions, left Lynmouth, giving the authorities the slip, and virtually stumbled on the would-be model village of Tremadoc created by William Madocks out of land reclaimed from the sea. Shelley supported this project, but over the months he came into conflict with local interests, a conflict culminating in his forced departure from his rented house (Tan-yr-Allt) in February 1813, after supposedly grappling with and being shot at by (and possibly himself firing at) a nocturnal assailant. Traditionally dismissed in the words of Thomas Love Peacock as a &#145;sort of semi-delusion&#146;  (Mullan, 315), Shelley's account of the incident has recently received cautious endorsement.<br>
<br>Between late 1812 and July 1814 Shelley's personal life went through a phase of great turbulence. In October 1812 he first met Godwin and through him other figures such as the eccentric John Frank Newton, whose vegetarian and Zoroastrian ideas made a considerable impression on the poet; about this time, too, he met Peacock, a man different in temperament from Shelley, but sharing with him and, indeed, doing much to foster in the younger poet over the years a love of classical literature: a love with heterodox ideological implications. In November 1812 Elizabeth Hitchener, who had, in Harriet's words, turned out to be a &#145;great disappointment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.331), left Shelley's household in a manner that suggests she was virtually expelled. Shelley emerges somewhat tarnished from the affair. To Hogg he acknowledged the &#145;fatuity, inconsistency, and bad taste&#146; apparent in his idealization of his former Platonic soulmate, now known as the &#145;Brown Demon&#146;  (ibid., 1.336), and he arranged to pay her a small stipend.<br>
<br>After leaving Tan-yr-Allt, Shelley spent a few weeks in Dublin and Killarney. From Dublin he wrote to the publisher Thomas Hookham of his new poem <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>, which should, he instructed, be printed &#145;on fine paper &amp; so as to catch the aristocrats&#146; whose sons and daughters Shelley hoped to reach  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.361), revealing his abiding and often shrewd concern for audience. Breathing indignation against tyranny in fiercely denunciatory blank verse, and containing eloquent essay-like notes on such subjects as the evils of meat-eating and marriage, <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> shows the youthful radical poet in quintessential form. Shelley decided against publication, but he distributed some seventy copies to individuals. Frequently pirated, the poem was easily the most widely read of Shelley's poems for many years and inspired the Chartists and others. Subtitled &#145;A Philosophical Poem&#146;, the poem displays the range of Shelley's early intellectual interests, and forms something of a compendium of Enlightenment ideas. <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> is especially influenced by the materialism of the <i>philosophes</i>. Preferring the impersonal concept of Necessity to the Christian notion of God, it is pervaded by a vision of existence as dynamic and capable of endless betterment.<br>
<br>In 1813 Shelley's money problems, which dogged him throughout his life, were acute, involving him, in October, in taking out a &#145;post-obit&#146; loan of &pound;2000 for &pound;500. A daughter, Eliza Ianthe, was born to Shelley and Harriet in June 1813, but the first evidence of rifts between husband and wife appear in this year, when Shelley writes to Hogg in November that &#145;I shall return to London alone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.379&#150;80). In the same year Shelley came to know Mme de Boinville and her daughter Cornelia, with whom he appears to have been briefly in love; Mme de Boinville was the widow of a French soldier who died during the retreat from Moscow in February 1813, and as late as April 1819 Shelley expressed his retrospective admiration for her, partly because of her sympathy for recent French history, as &#145;the most admirable specimen of a human being I had ever seen&#146;  (ibid., 2.92). In 1814 Shelley turned for comfort to Mme de Boinville and Cornelia as his ties with Harriet began to unravel; the domestic unhappiness he was experiencing, especially with regard to the influence exercised by Eliza Westbrook, and the tug of the Boinville household underlie his affecting &#145;Stanzas.&#151;April, 1814&#146;, a poem whose rhythmic pulse quickens and slows in expressive ways. At the same time his interest in theological polemic resurfaces in his cunningly organized dialogue <span class="italic">A Refutation of Deism</span>, anonymously published in 1814. Though he remarried Harriet in March to ensure her legal status as his wife, Shelley's emotional restlessness is apparent in his actions and in certain verses. He began to feel, so he later told Hogg, that his marriage had failed, &#145;as if a dead &amp; living body had been linked together in loathsome &amp; horrible communion&#146;  (ibid., 1.402), and in May and June of 1814 he formed a passionate relationship with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (1797&#150;1851) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25311/', "Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft")</script>], his mentor's daughter. After a period of some anguish and self-division, he chose and was chosen by Mary, both these creative geniuses embarking on the most significant relationship of their lives after Mary told Shelley of her love beside the grave of her illustrious mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, in St Pancras churchyard. Shelley spoke to Godwin of their feelings, but Godwin expressed disapproval of the relationship.<br>
<br>The upshot was Shelley's and Mary's secret elopement to the continent on 28 July. Mary's half-sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5428/', "Jane (later Claire) Clairmont (1798&#150;1879)")</script> accompanied them at Shelley's last minute suggestion, refusing to turn back at Calais, despite the pleas of her mother, the second Mrs Godwin, who had pursued and caught up with the runaways. Thus was fostered a triangular relationship that grew increasingly troubled over the years, and caused Mary, in particular, much distress. However, Shelley developed with Claire an intimate friendship of great importance to him. The three escapees travelled through France (where they witnessed the recent devastation caused by the Napoleonic wars) to Switzerland, and then by river back to Rotterdam, before returning to London. Shelley began <span class="italic">The Assassins</span>, a fragment of a novel, of interest for its attempt to imagine an ideal community.<br>
<br>Harriet lamented that Shelley had been seduced by Godwin's daughter and ideas, and had ceased to be the man she loved. Despite Shelley's quixotic offer in a letter from Switzerland that she should still live under his protection, their relations deteriorated over the year. As Harriet struggled to negotiate with Shelley, she received a number of coldly offensive letters from him, best understood as showing on Shelley's part repressed guilt about his decision to abandon his wife and daughter. As in other crises in his life, where Shelley's need to think well of himself was threatened by the possibility that others might criticize his conduct, his response to Harriet was to assert an ideal self-image. But despite his declaration in September 1814 that &#145;You are plainly lost to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 1.398), some measure of the messy intricacy of their relations is given by the fact that at the end of November their second child, Charles, was born. Shelley, Mary, and Claire spent the latter half of 1814 in a variety of London lodgings, including 56 Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, 5 Church Terrace, St Pancras, the Cross Keys inn in St John's Street, and 2 Nelson Square, Blackfriars Road. Often Shelley was on the run from bailiffs and creditors, able to meet the now pregnant Mary only intermittently.<h2>
<a name="18151816poetrytravelsuicides"></a>1815&#150;1816: poetry, travel, suicides</h2>Shelley's financial difficulties were temporarily solved after the death of his grandfather Sir Bysshe in January 1815. He immediately took a large apartment at Hans Place in London. Leaving Mary with Hogg, Shelley went with Claire to Field Place for the reading of the will, but he was not permitted to enter the house; he awaited the outcome of the will sitting on the front steps, where he read Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span>. The resulting settlement with his father (finalized in May) gave Shelley a lump sum of &pound;4500 as well as a sum of &pound;2900 to settle outstanding debts (which Shelley did only to a limited extent: unpaid creditors included Thomas Charters, from whom Shelley had ordered a carriage in 1813, and the Nash brothers, moneylenders from whom Shelley borrowed a large sum, also in 1813). By the financial arrangement Shelley also received a yearly allowance of &pound;1000, to be paid quarterly, of which he agreed to give &pound;200 per year to Harriet; he also paid Harriet a sum of &pound;200 to cope with immediate difficulties. Shelley gave Godwin &pound;1000, though that did little to stop the older man's demands for money.<br>
<br>The opening months of 1815 are harder to reconstruct than most periods in Shelley's life because relevant sections of Mary's (and Shelley's) journals have been destroyed. These sections may have documented his efforts to set up a shared community of friends, in which, in addition to the central relationship between himself and Mary, there would be a close intimacy (possibly sexual) between Mary and Hogg, as well as a tutor&#150;pupil relationship between himself and Claire. Mary's letters to Hogg during this period suggest a flirtation just stopping short of sexual intimacy, and it is to Hogg she wrote for consolation after the death on 6 March of her unnamed baby daughter, who had been born prematurely on 22 February. Mary's relationship with Hogg did not survive long. Her jealousy with regard to Shelley and Claire was longer-lasting and made for difficulties, as it would throughout Shelley's life. As a result Claire temporarily left the Shelley household in May; she returned in the spring of 1816 when she pursued Lord Byron, having a brief affair with him that led to the birth of their daughter, Allegra.<br>
<br>It is in 1815 that Shelley emerges as a major poet, composing by the end of the year the blank-verse poem <span class="italic">Alastor</span>, his enigmatic and haunting study of longing, desire, and what in the &#145;Preface&#146; he calls &#145;self-centred seclusion&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 69). The poem was partly inspired by a boat trip taken by Shelley, Mary, Peacock, and Charles Clairmont in August up the Thames from Windsor lock (Shelley had rented a house in Bishopsgate, at the edge of Windsor Great Park) to Lechlade, and back again. Shelley's atmospheric and sceptically hopeful lyric &#145;A Summer Evening Church-Yard&#146; was written at Lechlade, and included in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Alastor, or, The Spirit of Solitude; and other Poems</span>, published by Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy in February 1816 after Shelley had offered the title poem to John Murray, Byron's publisher. The volume also contained much revised versions of the first two cantos of <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>, published under the title &#145;The Daemon of the World&#146;, along with another revised section (entitled &#145;Superstition&#146;) from canto 6. In style and theme <span class="italic">Alastor</span> shows the influence of Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Excursion</span> (1814) and its portrait of the disillusioned Solitary. While Shelley disliked Wordsworth's reactionary politics (as he saw them), <span class="italic">Alastor</span> reveals that he now regarded the question of the poet's role as provoking dilemmas. Furnished with an epigraph from St Augustine about wanting to love while not finding what to love, the poem, in its brooding introspection, is a world away from the explicit radicalism of <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>. <span class="italic">Alastor</span> is at some level an elegy for Shelley's failed marriage with Harriet. It gives readers access, however obliquely, to Shelley's deepest feelings about that failure, and its sources in his compulsion to idealize. It sold reasonably well, though the reviews were not especially favourable, giving Shelley his first taste of the relative critical neglect which his published poems encountered during his lifetime.<br>
<br>In January 1816 Mary and Shelley's son William was born at Bishopsgate. Over the next few months Shelley moved with his family (by now including Claire once more) into several lodging addresses in London: 13 Norfolk Street, 32 Norfolk Street, and 26 Marchmont Street. On 3 May they left for the continent, partly driven to do so by continuing financial problems arising out of the decision by chancery not to allow the arrangement agreed between Shelley and his father the previous year (whereby Shelley would sell to his father the rights of reversion granted him by his grandfather's will). Shelley's party arrived in Paris on 8 May, leaving two days later for Geneva so that Claire could be near Byron; they got there on 13 May, first staying in Secheron, at the H&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre, where Byron arrived with Dr Polidori in late May. The poets, introduced by Claire, began a major, if sometimes fraught, personal and poetic friendship. Polidori, a somewhat trying presence, found Shelley &#145;bashful, shy, consumptive&#146; at first meeting, but soon came to view him as &#145;very clever&#146;  (Mullan, 418). Early in June Shelley moved to a small cottage close to Lake Geneva near Cologny, while a few days later Byron took up residence in the Villa Diodati, a rather grander house once lived in by Milton. Shelley and Byron talked and sailed together, making an extended trip round the lake towards the end of June, during which they visited various places made famous by Rousseau's <span class="italic">La nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</span>. Rousseau is the subject of ambivalent stanzas in canto 3 of Byron's <span class="italic">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span>, much of which was written in his stay at Geneva, and reflects the influence of Shelley and his advocacy of Wordsworth's poetry. Other works which resulted from this creative summer include Mary's <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span>, inspired, in part, by Shelley's and Byron's ideas: &#145;Many and long&#146;, she would later write, &#145;were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener&#146;  (Holmes, 328). Shelley contributed to the composition of the novel (the manuscript shows substantial additions and corrections in his hand), and the helpfulness of his interventions has been a matter of controversy. Readers can now study the evidence in Charles E. Robinson's facsimile edition; on balance, it is clear that the novel's composition represents another example of the creative collaboration (sometimes involving differences of outlook) that did much to benefit the writing of both the Shelleys. Shelley also secured publication of the novel with Lackington (it appeared in 1818).<br>
<br>Shelley himself composed relatively little by comparison with Byron, whose productivity often seemed to inhibit his friend. However, he did write two major shorter poems, &#145;Hymn to Intellectual Beauty&#146;, drafted on his boat excursion with Byron, and &#145;Mont Blanc&#146;, written after his visit in late July to Chamonix, finished versions of which were probably left with Byron on Shelley's return to England at the end of August 1816, in a notebook which turned up in 1976 in a trunk belonging to Scrope Berdmore Davies, to whom the notebook was almost certainly entrusted by Byron. This notebook also contains two hitherto unknown sonnets which, to judge from internal evidence, are by Shelley: &#145;Upon the Wandering Winds that through the Sky&#146; and &#145;To Laughter&#146;. The versions by which the &#145;Hymn&#146; and &#145;Mont Blanc&#146; are usually known derive from their first printings in 1817: the &#145;Hymn&#146; in <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> and &#145;Mont Blanc&#146; in <span class="italic">History of a Six Weeks' Tour</span>, an account, largely written by Mary, of both their visits to the continent and containing vividly detailed letters by Shelley to Peacock, describing his experience of visiting Mont Blanc. The poems were Shelley's finest creations to date: the &#145;Hymn&#146; creates its own secular alternative to traditional Christian worship, but it is alive to the fact that its own faith is built on hope and desire; refusing to find in the sublimity of the Alps evidence of a benevolent deity, &#145;Mont Blanc&#146; explores the mind's &#145;imaginings&#146; and the way they can free themselves from politically and spiritually crippling deference to absolutes. Both poems challenge through their style as well as through their meaning. The &#145;Hymn&#146; is concerned with what lies beyond the senses, and employs an array of comparisons designed to suggest the unstable, fascinating lure of intellectual beauty; &#145;Mont Blanc&#146; mimics the &#145;unremitting interchange&#146; between the mind and the external world through an irregular rhyme scheme, purposefully ambiguous syntax, and the deliberate subversion of its own developing structures of understanding. Shelley's stylistic intricacy in many of his poems has been seen as confusion by his detractors; but it is best viewed as an appropriate vehicle for a poet who blends precision and intensity as he presses beyond appearances and seeks to capture dynamic processes of consciousness, history, and the cosmos. It is the style of a sophisticated, self-aware questioner and transformer of supposed reality, and, revealingly, during the visit to Chamonix, Shelley signed himself (in Greek) in the registers of several hotels as &#145;democrat, great lover of mankind, and atheist&#146;  (Bradley, 33), a declaration which, despite Byron's erasure of one such entry, would soon become notorious.<br>
<br>Shelley returned with his companions to England in September, after visiting Versailles. He had with him a copy of Byron's <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>, canto 3, having been commissioned by the author to deliver the manuscript to and arrange terms with the publisher, John Murray, who refused to send proofs to Shelley. Claire, by now pregnant, took lodgings with Mary at 5 Abbey Churchyard, Bath. The rest of the year was shadowed by two suicides: that of Fanny Imlay, Mary's half-sister and daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and Gilbert Imlay, and that of Harriet Shelley. Fanny Imlay, depressed at being left behind with the Godwins by Shelley, Mary, and Claire, as well as having recently learned that she was illegitimate, overdosed with opium on 9 October in the Mackworth Arms, Swansea. Shelley's &#145;Her voice did quiver as we parted&#146; captures his distressed feelings about Fanny's death, the circumstances of which Godwin kept secret.<br>
<br>Tragedy came even closer to home in the next few months. Harriet Shelley was found dead in the Serpentine on 10 December, &#145;far advanced in pregnancy&#146;, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> put it  (Holmes, 352); she left a heart-rending note, probably written on 7 December, intended for Shelley, her parents, and her sister Eliza, in which she expressed her wish that Ianthe should be brought up by Eliza. Shelley's immediate response to Harriet's death was to deny responsibility and impute blame to the Westbrook family. He was determined to obtain custody of the children, and partly to achieve this end, married Mary on 30 December at St Mildred's Church, Bread Street, London, an event which caused Godwin and his wife much satisfaction, and brought about a reconciliation between Godwin and Shelley. Leigh Hunt, whom Shelley had just met before learning of Harriet's death, and who introduced the younger man to Horace Smith and John Keats, became possibly Shelley's closest friend, and certainly his principal literary ally, partly because of his support at this difficult time.<br>
<br>The long-term effect on Shelley of Harriet's death was considerable; its full, desolate impact can be felt in the central autobiographical passage of <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>. Much later, taking exception to W. M. Rossetti's attempts to whitewash Shelley, Claire Clairmont wrote that &#145;Harriet's suicide had a beneficial effect on Shelley&#151;he became much less confident in himself and not so wild as he had been before&#146;  (Holmes, 356). Peacock, always an advocate of his friend's first wife, reported that Shelley's &#145;feeling for Harriet's death grew into a deep and abiding sorrow&#146;  (ibid., 358). From this time forward, however optimistic Shelley might wish to be, he frequently displayed in his writing an awareness of guilt, painful memory, and remorse that suggests first-hand knowledge.<h2>
<a name="18171818fromEnglandtoItaly"></a>1817&#150;1818: from England to Italy</h2>Much of Shelley's energies in the months after Harriet's suicide went into the attempt to gain custody of their children. In this he was opposed by the Westbrook family, and the case came before Lord Eldon, the lord chancellor, who in a celebrated decision ruled on 27 March 1817 that neither Shelley nor the Westbrooks should have custody. Eldon decided against Shelley on the grounds that the latter's &#145;principles&#146; would lead to the recommendation of &#145;conduct&#146; that was &#145;immoral and vicious&#146;  (Blunden, 138). The children were put in the care of a Dr and Mrs Hume, at Shelley's suggestion. Shelley's bitterness at the decision finds its way into a number of poems, principally his complex cursing of Eldon in &#145;To the Lord Chancellor&#146;. Children were a crucial part of Shelley's life in 1817. On 12 January Claire Clairmont gave birth to Allegra, and on 2 September he and Mary had a daughter, Clara Everina. Shelley's attempts over the next few years to provide for Claire and Allegra and to interest Byron in his daughter's welfare show him at his most tactful and prepossessing, even though they exposed him to scandal about his relations with Claire. Disaster ensued later in Italy after Shelley had returned Allegra to Byron in 1818; in 1822 the girl died of typhoid in a convent in Bagnacavallo.<br>
<br>Awaiting the chancery decision, Shelley and Mary spent much time with the Hunts at their house in Hampstead, where they met Hunt's circle. Only Horace Smith, a banker and writer of parodic verses, took a warm liking to Shelley, providing a vivid picture of Shelley's manner (&#145;it was impossible to doubt even for a moment that you were gazing upon a <i>gentleman</i>&#146;  (Blunden, 145)). William Hazlitt found him &#145;sanguine-complexioned, and shrill-voiced&#146; and thought him too much &#145;the philosophic fanatic&#146;  (ibid., 143). Keats, according to Hunt, &#145;did not take to Shelley as kindly as Shelley did to him&#146;  (ibid., 142), probably feeling that Smith's &#145;gentleman&#146; was a little too persuaded of his social distinction. Benjamin Robert Haydon, the painter, quarrelled with Shelley when the poet began &#145;saying in the most feminine and gentle voice, &#147;As to that detestable religion, the Christian &hellip;&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 143).<br>
<br>Provoking as Shelley could no doubt be, his desire to change minds acted as a creative spur throughout a year of social unrest and clamour for political reform. In March, just before Shelley moved into Albion House in Marlow, Charles and James Ollier published his pamphlet <span class="italic">A Proposal for Putting Reform to the Vote throughout the Kingdom</span>. In this work Shelley seeks to promote a gradualist approach to &#145;beneficial innovations&#146; such as reform of parliament, declaring &#145;Universal Suffrage&#146; to be, at present, &#145;a measure fraught with peril&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 175). Throughout Shelley's career, the tension between his radical visions and his readiness to support step-by-step reforms, along with his awareness of what elsewhere he calls &#145;the difficult and unbending realities of actual life&#146;  (Clark, 254), gave a satisfying complexity to his political utopianism. Later in the year, also using the pseudonym of the &#145;Hermit of Marlow&#146;, Shelley produced his most vigorous and sardonic piece of political prose, <span class="italic">An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte</span>, in which he laments the death, not of the princess, but of Liberty as a result of the execution of three labourers involved in the abortive Pentridge revolution; the pamphlet, of which only a few copies were printed, concludes with an imagining of some &#145;glorious Phantom&#146; (Liberty reborn)  (<span class="italic">Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 239), which anticipates the close of a later response to political repression, the sonnet &#145;England in 1819&#146;. Other major prose works probably written this year include fragments of the so-called &#145;Speculations on metaphysics&#146; (first published by Mary Shelley in 1840) and the fascinating if unfinished <span class="italic">Essay on Christianity</span> (first published by Lady Shelley in her <span class="italic">Shelley Memorials</span> in 1859), altogether a more thoughtful and inward reading of that religion than is supplied by <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span>. Here Shelley offers a mainly, but not solely, humanist account of God, suggests that the notion of life after death is a delightful fiction, and praises the teachings of Christ, which are glossed in a way that sounds distinctly Shelleyan.<br>
<br>But the main project of 1817 was Shelley's latter-day epic poem, written in Spenserian stanzas, <span class="italic">Laon and Cythna</span>, published by Ollier, with Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, in December 1817. Retitled <span class="italic">The Revolt of Islam</span>, the work was republished the next month in censored form, after Shelley had reluctantly agreed to cut overtly anti-Christian phrases and references to an incestuous relation between the hero and heroine. Shelley described the poem in his &#145;Preface&#146; as &#145;an experiment on the temper of the public mind&#146;  (T. Hutchinson, ed., <span class="italic">Shelley: Poetical Works</span>, corr. G. M. Matthews, 1970, 32). Yet, for all its beauty of versification and power of thought, the poem was too cloudily symbolic and abstractly anti-establishment to be popular. The <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> ran a particularly sharp and hostile piece on the poem. The reviewer was J. T. Coleridge, but Shelley suspected Southey, a suspicion which led in 1820 to a bitter exchange of letters between the two poets. <span class="italic">The Revolt of Islam</span> contains in its &#145;Preface&#146; and its dedicatory stanzas to Mary passages of idealized poetic autobiography, in which Shelley presents himself as the mouthpiece for &#145;Truth's Deathless Voice&#146;. Much of the poem concerns itself with replaying the French Revolution and depicting Laon and Cythna as heroic revolutionary figures. The fact that the two central figures go to a post-mortal &#145;Temple of the Spirit&#146; after the failure of the revolution indicates the poem's enriching awareness that its political and spiritual goals are hard to achieve.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1818 Shelley left England for Italy, never to return. His departure was motivated by financial and health problems (including a recent bout of ophthalmia, possibly the result of visiting the poor in Marlow), as well as by the wish to hand over Allegra to Byron, the fear that after Lord Eldon's judgment he might lose the children he had with Mary, and an increasing sense of alienation from English society and culture. His early response to &#145;the loveliness of the earth &amp; the serenity of the sky&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.3) gives a foretaste of how his poetic gifts flourished in response to the landscape and artistic heritage of Italy. At the Casa Bertini in the Bagni di Lucca, where Shelley and his party stayed from June to August, he translated Plato's <span class="italic">Symposium</span> in ten days. Shelley's gifts as a translator were remarkable, as <span class="italic">The Cyclops</span>, his expert version of Euripides' work, bears witness. His elegant translation of the <span class="italic">Symposium</span> indicates the growing importance of the Greek philosopher for Shelley's thinking; Plato's ideas and images pervade Shelley's Italian productions, though Shelley is too sceptical about ultimate truth ever to be a Platonist in any strict philosophical sense. About this time he wrote his brief but important essay &#145;On love&#146; and his <span class="italic">Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks Relative to the Subject of Love</span> (not published in full until 1931). In August he finished <span class="italic">Rosalind and Helen</span>, a poem begun the previous year, and published in the spring of 1819; it is a minor by-product of <span class="italic">Laon and Cythna</span>, most interesting for its presentation of the poet figure, Lionel.<br>
<br>Prompted, in part, by Claire's anxieties about Allegra, Shelley renewed his acquaintance with Byron in Venice in late August. Their conversations and disagreements about human destiny found their way into <span class="italic">Julian and Maddalo</span> (first published in 1824), which was finished in August 1819, another of Shelley's masterpieces that both incites and frustrates biographical speculation. The poem's couplets accommodate a range of inflections, and its two main characters, the optimistic Julian and the pessimistic Maddalo, overhear at the poem's centre a disturbed and disturbing speech by a Maniac who has been disappointed in love. Shelley's marital problems may find covert expression in this section of the poem. It is likely that there was strain between him and Mary following the death of their daughter Clara in September 1818 after Mary had undertaken, at Shelley's instructions, a long journey in the Italian heat from Este to Padua. More anguish followed in June 1819, when their much-loved son William died, plunging Mary into profound melancholia and creating a distance and tension between her and Shelley which shadowed their marriage henceforth. In between these tragic deaths occurred the mysterious episode of Shelley's &#145;Neapolitan charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.211). A girl, born on 27 December 1818, was registered as &#145;Elena Adelaide Shelley&#146;. Despite the later blackmailing allegations of an Italian servant, Paolo Foggi, it is unlikely that Claire was the mother; the view that the Shelleys' Swiss servant Elise (later Foggi's wife, her maiden name is unknown) was the mother is sometimes expressed; some biographers see Shelley as the likely father, but there is no proof of this. The child was left in Naples with foster parents after Shelley left. She died in the summer of 1820, an event that produced in the poet a morbid sense that &#145;the destruction that is consuming me&#146; was like &#145;an atmosphere which wrapt &amp; infected everything connected with me&#146;  (ibid.). The pressures endured by Shelley at the close of 1818 are turned into lyric art in his &#145;Stanzas Written in Dejection&#146;. Personal and political dejection also mark his fine <span class="italic">Lines Written among the Euganean Hills</span>, a reworking of the eighteenth-century prospect poem, begun at Este in October and included in the <span class="italic">Rosalind and Helen</span> volume; the poem records what Shelley in the volume's &#145;Advertisement&#146; calls &#145;the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency&#146;  (T. Hutchinson, ed., <span class="italic">Shelley: Poetical Works</span>, corr. G. M. Matthews, 1970, 167), and it concludes with a brief imagining of happiness and peace.<h2>
<a name="18191820Italianmasterpieces"></a>1819&#150;1820: Italian masterpieces</h2>Shelley's creative resilience in the face of personal suffering is remarkable. In 1819 he wrote many of the works by which he is best known. His responsiveness to Italian landscapes, history, and art, recorded in some majestic letters written to Peacock, is especially acute around this period. In January 1819 he visited Pompeii, in February Paestum, and in March he arrived in Rome, experiences which would leave deep impressions on his imagination. These impressions were not always radiant. In <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>, II. iv, Shelley seems to draw an image of the &#145;great chain&#146; of evil from his sight in the square of St Peter's of &#145;300 fettered criminals at work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.93). Indeed, 1819 is a year in which Shelley's career-long belief in the need to:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">hope, till Hope creates<br>
</div>
<div>From its own wreck the thing it contemplates<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span>, IV. 573&#150;4)</blockquote>receives severe tests as well as eloquent reaffirmation. <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> was largely written in this year (it was begun at Este in 1818 and was published by Ollier with some shorter poems in August 1820).<br>
<br>The work represents, in its allusive sophistication, multiplicity of imaginative suggestions, generic complexity (it is a &#145;lyrical drama&#146;), and richness of invention, Shelley's most ambitious attempt to &#145;familiarise the highly refined imagination&#146; of his readers &#145;with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence&#146;, as he puts it in his &#145;Preface&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 135). But it is a mark of his readiness to take a full look at the worst that while or, in the case of &#145;Athanase&#146;, in the months before, he was working on the lyrical drama he also composed at least five substantial works exploring darker aspects of the human condition: in addition to <span class="italic">Julian and Maddalo</span> and <span class="italic">Lines Written among the Euganean Hills</span>, these works include &#145;Athanase&#146; (first published in 1824), in which Shelley presents a condition of unexplained dejection; <span class="italic">The Cenci</span> (first published in 1819), a gripping drama that centres on the ethics of revenge, which was turned down by the major London theatres because of the incestuous rape at its heart; and <span class="italic">The Mask of Anarchy</span>, a satirical yet visionary ballad, written in response to the infamous Peterloo massacre that took place in Manchester in August. Like many of Shelley's most uncompromising works, <span class="italic">The Mask of Anarchy</span>, which settles scores with members of the Liverpool administration such as Castlereagh and Eldon, was published only after Shelley's death (in 1832 by Leigh Hunt, to whom it had been sent by Shelley, who hoped that his friend might publish the poem in his literary and political paper, <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>). <span class="italic">The Cenci</span> made it into a second edition (published in 1821), the only work of Shelley's to do so in his lifetime. Its relative popularity derived, in part, from its readiness to deal with believable characters in an austere blank verse unburdened by what in his &#145;Preface&#146; Shelley says is &#145;commonly called mere poetry&#146;  (ibid., 241). John Scott's review of the work was reasonably typical: he disapproved of its &#145;radical foulness of moral complexion&#146;, but he complimented its &#145;uncommon force of poetical sentiment&#146;  (O'Neill, 97).<br>
<br>The year 1819, in many ways Shelley's <i>annus mirabilis</i>, saw him (and his party) moving round Italy. He stayed in Rome until just after the death of his son, then he moved to the Villa Valsovano between Leghorn and Monte Nero; in October he switched to the via Valfonda in Florence. While he was in Rome his portrait was painted by Amelia Curran, daughter of the Irish nationalist and acquaintance of Shelley John Philpott Curran. This portrait, the best-known picture of Shelley, was regarded as &#145;ill done&#146; by the artist herself, who had been on the point of burning it when it was sent for by Mary Shelley after her husband's death  (Holmes, 512). It offers a sentimentalized picture of the poet as a boyish angel, but, in fairness, Medwin could &#145;conceive of no one so difficult to pourtray&#146; on account of Shelley's &#145;ever flitting and varied&#146; expression  (Woof, 92). Most contemporary descriptions note his height (5 feet 10 or 11 inches), slight stoop, prematurely grey hair (associated by Shelley, it would appear from a passage in <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, with a bout of venereal disease), slimness, brilliant eyes, small nose, pointed chin, and fair complexion. Leigh Hunt remarks on &#145;the sensitiveness and tremulous firmness of the mouth&#146;  (ibid., 92).<br>
<br>While living in Florence, at the Palazzo Marini, 4395 via Valfonda, Shelley wrote his greatest shorter poem, &#145;Ode to the West Wind&#146;, in which prosodic brilliance (each section is a sonnet in <i>terza rima</i> with a concluding couplet), metaphorical daring, and poignant feeling combine to create an enduring record of his desire to &#145;scatter&#146; his &#145;words among mankind&#146;. During this time he also wrote <span class="italic">Peter Bell the Third</span> (not published until 1839), a poem that again demonstrates Shelley's underestimated capacity to write with penetrating and subtle wit as it mocks Wordsworth's &#145;dullness&#146; yet shows admiration for his achievement. Shelley hoped to publish a series of &#145;<i>popular songs</i> wholly political&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.191) as a separate volume, but he could not persuade his publishing contacts in England (principally Leigh Hunt) to help these often inflammatory works into print at a time of increasing political repression. Also fated not to be published until many years after his death was a long, unfinished prose treatise, <span class="italic">A Philosophical View of Reform</span>, which he began in November 1819, a work which sets out in detail Shelley's mature political views, and illustrates both his awareness that change is a complicated process and that change for the better is unremittingly to be pursued. A further piece of political prose written about this time&#151;and also unpublished during his life&#151;is his letter to <span class="italic">The Examiner</span> protesting about the sentencing to three years' imprisonment of Richard Carlile on a charge of blasphemous libel. Here Shelley shows a capacity for witty polemic that is apparent, too, in his subsequent essay &#145;On the devil, and devils&#146; (written between late 1819 and June 1820). In the midst of this furious literary activity Mary gave birth to a son, Percy Florence, on 12 November. Shelley and Mary were visited by Sophia Stacey, a ward of the poet's uncle Robert Parker, and a friendship briefly blossomed. Stacey had a good singing voice, and she was the recipient of a number of lyrics written for her by the poet, including &#145;Thou art fair, and few are fairer&#146; and a version of the impassioned, virtuosic poem variously known as &#145;The Indian Serenade&#146; and &#145;An Indian Girl's Song&#146; (this poem may also have been given as a gift to Jane Williams, the common-law wife of Edward Ellerker Williams, in 1821).<br>
<br>Sophia Stacey left for Rome on 29 December, and the Shelleys themselves left for Pisa on 26 January 1820. As always, Shelley followed public events with keen interest: the stirrings of revolt in Spain in January prompted his &#145;Ode to Liberty&#146;, which sets the Spanish revolt in the context of the battle for freedom throughout history. Much of the poem, therefore, feels like a rhapsodic versifying of <span class="italic">A Philosophical View of Reform</span> and confirms Shelley's ease among poetic genres and modes, yet its intricacy extends beyond its syntax and rhyming; at the close, the prophetic &#145;song, its pinions disarrayed of might, / Drooped&#146; is an example of Shelley's fondness for staging uncertainty that inspiration will last. Along with &#145;Ode to the West Wind&#146;, &#145;The Sensitive Plant&#146;, &#145;The Cloud&#146;, &#145;To a Sky-Lark&#146;, and some other lyrics, &#145;Ode to Liberty&#146; was published in the <span class="italic">Prometheus Unbound</span> volume later in the year. The lyrical drama was the major work in the volume, but the accompanying pieces include some of Shelley's best work. &#145;The Sensitive Plant&#146; is a subtle fable about beauty and transience. It hopes against hope that since our senses may play us false, our cherished ideals may be true. In &#145;The Cloud&#146; celebration of the natural becomes, in the context of the volume, libertarian affirmation: &#145;I change, but I cannot die&#146;. Unfortunately, despite Shelley's requests to Ollier that he be sent &#145;the <i>revised</i> sheets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.178), he did not receive proofs of the volume; the result was that the title-poem, in particular, was printed full of errors. Modern editors are still trying to track down how many. The volume received a perceptive though qualified review by John Lockhart in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, but it did not sell well.<br>
<br>In 1820 the Shelleys were a good deal in contact with Maria and John Gisborne. Maria's son from an earlier marriage, Henry Reveley, was another of those to whom Shelley lent money he could ill afford: in this case, to build a steamboat to run between Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles. The scheme failed, but one positive result of the friendship was Shelley's affectionate, amusing, and revealing <span class="italic">Letter to Maria Gisborne</span> (first published in 1824), which he wrote in June after he had moved to Leghorn to live in the Gisbornes' house, the owners having gone to London for a few months. At the heart of this epistle are shrewd and thoughtful portraits of Godwin, Coleridge, Hunt, Hogg, and Peacock. Godwin, who had been badgering Shelley for money, is seen as &#145;fallen&#146;, and yet assured of fame &#145;Before the dread tribunal of <i>to come</i>&#146;. In July Shelley translated the Homeric <span class="italic">Hymn to Mercury</span>, written in <i>ottava rima</i>, and, in its delight in the god's prankster-like high spirits, a dry run for <span class="italic">The Witch of Atlas</span>, composed in a few days in August after the Shelleys had moved to the Baths of San Giuliano, near Pisa. <span class="italic">The Witch of Atlas</span> displays a fine-spun, ethereal myth making and a tone of lawless shape changing. Avoiding polemic, it succeeds in opposing the authoritarian and orthodox less through statement than style. Yet, as often in Shelley's later work, &#145;a shadow tracks [its] flight of fire&#146;, to borrow a line from &#145;The Two Spirits: an Allegory&#146;, since the Witch's aloofness from human sorrow reminds the reader, by contrast, of what, in his &#145;Dedication&#146; to <span class="italic">The Cenci</span>, Shelley calls &#145;sad reality&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 237). About this time Shelley wrote <span class="italic">Swellfoot the Tyrant</span>, a mock-Aristophanic work that responds wittily to the Queen Caroline affair, exploiting the conventions of radical satire to indict the Liverpool government and envisage revolutionary change when Liberty makes common cause with Famine: the work was published by J. Johnston in December but immediately suppressed at the insistence of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. Another poem also responding to political turmoil is the impassioned if highly rhetorical &#145;Ode to Naples&#146;, written in the latter half of August.<br>
<br>The &#145;Ode&#146; is typical of Shelley's later work in its occasional nature, as though, after various critical buffetings, he needed to be spurred into verse by some specific event or fact. Certainly some of his finest work from this time forward originates in its response to such stimuli, even as his letters begin to brood on his sense that he was, &#145;speaking literarily, infirm of purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.244). At the end of October Shelley moved back to Pisa; he met a beautiful, young woman, Teresa Viviani (1801&#150;1836), who was being kept in a convent awaiting the outcome of marriage arrangements in which she played little part. Once again, Shelley was fired by the wish to save a young woman in distress, as he had been with his first wife; once again, disenchantment was the consequence.<h2>
<a name="18211822lateworks"></a>1821&#150;1822: late works</h2>Shelley's final year and a half show him writing at the height of his powers, though often out of the depth of tangled feelings. Some of his most evidently personal poetry is written in these months, including&#151;and especially&#151;a series of lyric poems composed for Jane Williams. Jane and Edward arrived in Pisa in January 1821, attracted by what they had heard about Shelley from Medwin, who had been staying with the Shelleys since October 1820. Shelley's feelings for Jane are hard to assess accurately. They lie somewhere between friendship and love, and are, indeed, the overt subject of exploration in poems remarkable for a note that many critics have recognized as new: a note at once serene and frustrated, saddened and accepting, submitting to, perhaps even glad of, constraint, yet constantly if undemonstratively lamenting the gap between the human lot and<blockquote>
<div class="indent">some world far from ours,<br>
</div>
<div>Where music and moonlight and feeling<br>
</div>
<div>Are one.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>These poems, a late letter to John Gisborne (&#145;I only feel the want of those who can feel, and understand me &hellip; Mary does not&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.435)), and the central section of <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> indicate the growing difficulties Shelley was experiencing in his marriage with Mary Shelley. It should be said, however, that the marriage also seems at its maturest and most real in these months. The bond that kept husband and wife together may have sometimes felt like a chain, as in &#145;The Magnetic Lady to her Patient&#146;, but it was forged in the fires of shared trials, suffering, and creative interaction.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> was the one major poem that Mary printed without an additional note in her great editions of 1839&#151;and one can see why. In it, she plays a secondary role as &#145;The cold chaste Moon&#146;, forgotten altogether in the final &#145;invitation au voyage&#146; addressed to Viviani. That in the poem itself, and subsequently, Shelley recognized the desirability and impossibility of his fantasized &#145;Italian platonics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span>, 1.223), as Mary called them, suggests the centrality of <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> in any account of him as a poet of idealist desire. Shelley adapts Plato's and Dante's accounts of love in the <span class="italic">Symposium</span> and the <span class="italic">Vita nuova</span>, respectively, to his own highly individual explorations; the result is a masterpiece that can still disconcert as its couplets waver unstably and yet valuably between the spiritual and the sexual, the allegorical and the literal, the erotic and the political, devotion to one figure and advocacy of free love. Shelley first suggested a printing of 100 copies for the &#145;esoteric few&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.263), then asked Ollier to withdraw it from circulation.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of writing <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span> Shelley composed <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span>, his eloquent answer to Peacock's satirical &#145;Four ages of poetry&#146;. <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span>, sent to Ollier on 20 March though unpublished until Mary Shelley's <span class="italic">Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments</span> (1840 [1839]), contends that poetry is useful because it develops the imaginative powers of its readers. &#145;The great instrument of moral good&#146;, he writes, balancing the aesthetic and the ethical, &#145;is the imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the cause&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 488). As much a radiant prose-poem as critical treatise, the essay's implications are still being teased out by commentators. Typically, Shelley argues for an association between periods of political reform and great poetry, yet refrains from urging a causal link. The essay celebrates imaginative creativity above analytical reasoning, and reveals the poet's break with the Enlightenment reasoning on which his early work had depended. There are manifest links in phrasing and conceptualizing between <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span>, <span class="italic">Epipsychidion</span>, and <span class="italic">Adonais</span>, Shelley's elegy for John Keats who had died in Rome in February 1821. In this work Shelley, who subscribed to the belief that Keats's fatal illness had been brought on by a bad review in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, produced his most exalted vision of the significance of poets and poetry. Yet, giving poignancy to his praise for &#145;The splendours of the firmament of time&#146; is his desire to leave behind &#145;the contagion of the world's slow stain&#146;. Sometimes criticized as promoting an insipid image of Keats, <span class="italic">Adonais</span>, in fact, pays tribute to the achievement of a writer whose recent productions&#151;especially <span class="italic">Hyperion</span>&#151;were much admired by Shelley, always a perceptive and generous critic of his contemporaries. The elegy was printed in Pisa, so that Shelley could oversee the publishing process. A copy was sent to John Gisborne on 13 July, while others were given to Ollier for distribution. Ollier did distribute those copies Shelley sent to him, but he did not republish the poem; indeed, Ollier was irksomely unco-operative over the winter of 1821&#150;2, leading Shelley to search, unsuccessfully, for an alternative publisher.<br>
<br>Over the last few months of his life Shelley was engaged in a number of projects, including a play, <span class="italic">Charles the First</span>, of which a good deal of drafted material remains. His notebooks of the period bear witness to his work on translations (especially Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>), lyrics, and other projects, despite his increasingly insistent emphasis in letters on his loss of inspiration (accompanied by admiration for the prolific output of and success enjoyed by Byron, who had moved to Pisa in November 1821). Shelley's final published work <span class="italic">Hellas</span>, another &#145;lyrical drama&#146;, was composed in October 1821 and appeared in the first few months of 1822. It was sparked into being by Shelley's support for the Greeks in the War of Greek Independence which had broken out in April 1821; the poem, which Shelley called &#145;a mere improvise&#146;  (&#145;Preface&#146;), is dedicated to Prince Alexander Mavrocordato, later to become prime minister of Greece after independence, a friend of the Shelleys and the leading figure in a group of Greek exiles living in Pisa. Though the poem is partisan, it sets the struggle for Greek independence in vast historical and metaphysical contexts. Modelled on Aeschylus's <span class="italic">The Persians</span>, <span class="italic">Hellas</span> concentrates on the figure of a doomed tyrant, here Mahmoud, who, in dialogue with the sage Ahasuerus, is brought to a recognition of the futility of his power and of the supremacy of thought. The choral lyrics elaborate these ideas with musical sophistication.<br>
<br>Towards the end of April 1822 Shelley, anxious to move away from close proximity with Byron, moved with his family and that of Edward and Jane Williams to San Terenzo near Lerici in the Bay of Spezia, where the two families shared a house, the Casa Magni, a converted boathouse directly giving on to the sea. With Williams Shelley sailed in his new boat (which to his annoyance came from Genoa with the words <i>Don Juan</i> painted on the forward mainsail: Shelley insisted that the offending sections of sail be cut out and replaced). He also worked on his last major work, <span class="italic">The Triumph of Life</span>, which was left unfinished at his death, just after the poem's narrator has asked the question near the centre of Shelley's poetry: &#145;Then, what is Life?&#146; Despite its incomplete, much cancelled state, <span class="italic">The Triumph of Life</span>, a Romantic reworking of Dante and Petrarch, shows a creative intensity, a precision, and an inventiveness that are at odds with the seeming pessimism of its content: a visionary depiction of the nightmare of history and the failure of idealistic hope. Its overall mood turns out to be less disillusioned than relentlessly questioning, in common with Shelley's assertion in a late letter, &#145;Let us see the truth whatever that may be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.442).<br>
<br>The last weeks of Shelley's life were a turbulent mixture of pleasure in the beauty of nature and the companionship of Jane Williams, domestic problems, including a near-fatal miscarriage suffered by Mary on 16 June (Shelley saved her life by making her sit in a hip-bath full of ice to stop the bleeding), hallucinations, and troubled dreams. In a letter written just after Shelley's death, Mary recounts a number of such dreams and hallucinations: they include Shelley's nightmare that &#145;the sea was rushing in&#146; and that &#145;he saw the figure of himself strangling me [that is, Mary]&#146;, and a waking vision he experienced of meeting his double &#145;which met him as he walked on the terrace &amp; said to him&#151;&#147;How long do you mean to be content?&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span>, 1.245). Together with the emotional and creative stresses Shelley was evidently experiencing in San Terenzo, he expresses an affecting reluctance to think too far ahead into the future, feeling, in his own words, as though he stood &#145;upon a precipice &hellip;, content if the heaven above me is calm for the passing moment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.436). One plan he did throw himself into was the setting up, with Leigh Hunt and Byron, of the anti-establishment journal <span class="italic">The Liberal</span>. Hunt came to Italy to participate in this venture. On 1 July Shelley and Williams sailed to Leghorn to meet Hunt and his family whom they accompanied to Pisa. On 8 July Shelley, Williams, and Charles Vivian (a young sailor) began their return voyage to San Terenzo. A squall arose; the <i>Don Juan</i> sank accidentally (the suicide theory occasionally proffered is dubious); Shelley and Williams drowned, Shelley's body being washed ashore on 18 July near Viareggio. A month later, on 16 August 1822, exhumed from the sands where they were buried in quicklime, the bodies of Shelley and Williams were cremated near Viareggio in a scene described by Edward John Trelawny, the lively biographer of Shelley's last months.<br>
<br>Trelawny's account (revised several times by him) of the discovery of Shelley's body (a &#145;volume of Sophocles in one pocket, and Keats's poems in the other, doubled back&#146;  (Hogg, 2.217)) and of its cremation in a &#145;furnace&#146; he had obtained in Leghorn  (ibid., 2.220) may not be wholly trustworthy in its details. Doubt has been cast on the assertion that the organ snatched by Trelawny from the pyre and later quarrelled over by Hunt and Mary before being stored lovingly by the latter really was the poet's heart; it might, so a Mr A. S. Bicknell suggested to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in 1885, have been the poet's liver, an organ more likely to resist fire than the heart. But Trelawny, who evokes the sickened response of Byron, renders memorably a quasi-symbolic collision between the imaginative (Shelley's &#145;spirit soaring over us&#146;) and the corporeal (&#145;The corpse fell open and the heart was laid bare&#146;  (ibid., 2.223)). Trelawny collected the poet's ashes and subsequently placed them in 1823 in the protestant cemetery in Rome, where Keats and William Shelley were also buried.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>In Pisa before his death Shelley told Marianne Hunt, &#145;If I die tomorrow I have lived to be older than my father, I am ninety years of age&#146;  (Barker-Benfield, 190). The remark suggests the amount of experience he got through in his short life. Above all, this experience includes an astonishing intensity of intellectual and poetic activity. It has taken generations of critics and scholars a long time to come close to defining satisfactorily his wide-ranging achievement. As Shelley himself asserted in <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span>, probably with his own case in mind, &#145;the jury which sits in judgement upon a poet, belonging as he does to all time, must be composed of his peers: it must be impannelled from the selectest of the wise of many generations&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 486).<br>
<br>In the face of opposition from Sir Timothy, Shelley's father, Mary Shelley worked heroically to bring his work to public attention, and all readers of the poet are indebted to her impressive, if inevitably imperfect, editorial and critical labours. In understandable reaction against those who derided Shelley's poetry because they disliked his atheism and unconventional private life, she offered a version of Shelley in her &#145;Notes&#146; to her 1839 editions of the poems that is undeniably idealized. At the same time her comments on Shelley's poetic achievement in such works as <span class="italic">The Cenci</span> (a favourite of hers), and on his intellectual development, are always thought-provoking and often persuasive. The beginnings of a cult of Shelley are apparent in Mary's &#145;Notes&#146;, as well as in poetic tributes from the likes of Thomas Lovell Beddoes and Robert Browning (in <span class="italic">Pauline</span>, published in 1833); this cult took on more sentimental and full-blown form when custody of the poet's papers and reputation passed to Mary's son Percy Florence and his wife, Jane, Lady Shelley, who created at Boscombe Manor a virtual shrine to the poet's memory. Potentially disagreeable aspects of or opinions about the poet's life could not be wholly suppressed, however, as Lady Shelley discovered when she inadvisedly commissioned Hogg to write his life of Shelley, still influential: the portrayal of Shelley in recent works such as Ken Russell's film <span class="italic">Gothic</span> as a frantic visionary owes much to the representations of Hogg and others.<br>
<br>Despite the setting up of a Shelley Society in 1886 and the transformation of the poet in the eyes of some into a martyr at the hands of an uncaring and philistine world (a view given iconic form in the grandiose sculpture of Shelley by Onslow Ford installed in 1893 in the Oxford college that had expelled him), dislike of Shelley, often focusing on his treatment of his first wife, was articulated throughout the nineteenth century and beyond. Matthew Arnold's response to Edward Dowden's biography (1886)&#151;the first major attempt to see Shelley plain&#151;was to exclaim in disgust, &#145;that set!&#146;  (Norman, 235): Shelley's capacity to induce moral revulsion was as strong posthumously as it had been during his life. Indeed, seeing Shelley steadily and seeing him whole has always been difficult&#151;and, one is tempted to say, always will be. How to combine the political radical and the lyrical or imaginative poet has continually exercised readers of the poet. In their different ways, Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt, two of the poet's most intelligent advocates, felt under pressure to represent Shelley's radicalism in terms that would be thought acceptable by the readership which they were seeking to create for the poetry. Certainly later Victorian critics (Francis Thompson is a notable example) concentrated on the lyric beauty of the poet's writing at the expense of his engagement with history and politics.<br>
<br>Nor, until recently, has Shelley's poetic reputation ever been secure. Early on, his idealism and figurative complexity earned the adverse criticism of Hazlitt. In 1881 Matthew Arnold dismissed him as a &#145;beautiful and ineffectual angel&#146;, &#145;beating in the void his luminous wings in vain&#146;  (Swinden, 69). In the first half of the twentieth century Shelley's reputation suffered a sharply downwards plunge, as his poetry fell foul of modernist tenets of figurative concreteness and impersonality. His writing received partial and unjust verdicts from T. S. Eliot, who found that the man&#151;&#145;humourless, pedantic, self-centred and sometimes almost a blackguard&#146;  (ibid., 71)&#151;obtruded on the poetry, and F. R. Leavis, who excoriated a supposedly &#145;weak grasp upon the actual&#146;  (<span class="italic">Revaluation</span>, 1936, 194). In a period dominated by &#145;new criticism&#146;, with its attention to words on the page, Shelley's linguistic subtleties were largely&#151;and bafflingly&#151;ignored. Since the 1960s, however, Shelley's critical fortunes have soared thanks to rigorous attention to his intellectual complexity and poetic subtlety and integrity, and to the daunting task (spearheaded by scholars such as Donald H. Reiman, G. M. Matthews, Timothy Webb, E. B. Murray, and Kelvin Everest) of producing the best possible texts of his works. His concern with politics has received due and thoughtful recognition. That said, Shelley the political radical can be simplified and stereotyped as well as downplayed, and late-twentieth-century delight in a &#145;Red Shelley&#146; (the phrase is Paul Foot's) can be as misleading as the Victorian image of him as transcending topical issues; recent literary treatment of Shelley, as in Howard Brenton's play, <span class="italic">Bloody Poetry</span> (1985), often seems close to caricature. But the quality of critical and editorial work on Shelley has reached a new pitch of understanding. Clearly, Shelley's best modern critics recognize the applicability to his own work of his view in <span class="italic">A Defence of Poetry</span> that &#145;All high poetry is infinite&#146;, &#145;the source&#146;, for succeeding generations of readers, &#145;of an unforeseen and an unconceived delight&#146;  (Reiman and Powers, 500).<br>
