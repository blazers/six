<span class="headword">Eyre, Sir  Vincent</span>  (1811&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born at Portsdown, near Portsmouth, on 22 January 1811, the third son of Captain Henry Eyre, of an old family of Derbyshire cavaliers, and Mary, daughter of J. Concannon of Loughrea, co. Galway, Ireland. He was educated at Norwich grammar school under the Revd E. Valpy. Eyre attended Addiscombe College (1827&#150;8), and passed into the Bengal artillery in December 1828. He landed in Calcutta on 21 May 1829. After eight years he was promoted first lieutenant, and appointed to the horse artillery. In 1833 Eyre married Emily, daughter of Colonel Sir James Mouat, bt, Bengal Engineers. They had three sons and a daughter, and his wife died in 1851.<br>
<br>In 1839 Eyre was appointed commissary of ordnance to the Kabul field force. He took to Kabul a large quantity of ordnance stores, arriving in April 1840. On 2 November 1841 the rising took place in which Sir Alexander Burnes was killed. The British&#150;Indian force was soon besieged in the cantonments by the Afghans. They made desperate sallies, in one of which, on 13 November, Eyre was severely wounded. A treaty for evacuation was ratified on 1 January 1842. Eyre, still suffering from his wound, and accompanied by his wife and child, started with the column but they were taken as hostages by Akbar Khan. They spent nearly nine months in captivity, with other British captives, moved to different forts, and suffered many privations. The climate, however, was healthy; the captives held public worship and established a school for their children. Eyre kept a diary and sketched the officers and ladies. The manuscript was smuggled to a friend in India then published in England as <span class="italic">Military Operations at Cabul</span> (1843). In August the captives were hurried off towards Bamian in the Hindu Kush, under threat of being sold as slaves to the Uzbeks of Turkestan. They were saved by Pottinger, who on 11 September bought over the Afghan commanding their escort.<br>
<br>Eyre was then again posted to the horse artillery. While quartered at Meerut he founded a club for European soldiers, possibly the first such. In December 1844 he was appointed to command the artillery of the newly formed &#145;Gwalior contingent&#146; and made it efficient, as its mutiny service proved. While at Gwalior he attempted to found a settlement for Goan families left destitute after the defeat of the Maratha armies in 1803&#150;18. He obtained land for this which, at his wish, was called Esapore (the abode of Christians). It failed because of its unhealthy location. Eyre undertook the duties of engineer, architect, and road maker to the station, and erected an attractive little church.<br>
<br>In 1854 Eyre became major, and in May 1855 visited England on furlough. Inventive, he published in 1856 a pamphlet <span class="italic">On Metallic Boats and Floating Waggons for Naval and Military Service</span>. In February 1857 he returned to India, and was posted to a horse artillery battery in Burma, but was recalled to India at the mutiny. In July he was sent up the Ganges for Allahabad. On 28 July he reached Buxar, where he learned that a force of mutineers was besieging a fortified house at Arrah, 40 miles from Buxar. Eyre took the responsibility of disembarking 160 men of the 5th foot, who were travelling up the Ganges to Allahabad, and with them and his own force relieved Arrah and destroyed the mutineers' stronghold at Jagdispur. This brief campaign, undertaken on his own responsibility, restored British control of the area, secured communications by the Grand Trunk Road, revived British prestige, and drew from Outram the highest praise and recommendation for the Victoria Cross. Eyre now joined at Cawnpore the force advancing under Outram and Sir Henry Havelock to the relief of Lucknow. This reached Lucknow after four days' fighting. Eyre succeeded to the command of the artillery on the death of Brigadier Cooper. He was mentioned in dispatches, and in December 1857 was made lieutenant-colonel and CB. He became brevet colonel in December 1858.<br>
<br>After the suppression of the mutiny Eyre was appointed to superintend the powder works at Ishapore, near Calcutta. There in 1860, he married his cousin, Catherine Mary, daughter of Captain T. Eyre RN; they had no children and she survived him. In 1861 Eyre was selected by Lord Canning as a member of the commission on the amalgamation of the company's and queen's armies, and in 1862 was appointed inspector-general of ordnance in the Bengal army. In April 1863 he was ordered home on sick leave, and retired with the rank of major-general in October 1863. In 1867 he was made KCSI. He happened to be in France on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, and organized an ambulance service under the rules of the English National Red Cross Society. He formed a local committee in August at Boulogne, and for the next eight months he and Lady Eyre were the moving spirits in a most valuable organization. In 1874 he published <span class="italic">Lays of a Knight-Errant in Many Lands</span>.<br>
<br>Eyre wintered at Rome during his later years. In the summer of 1880 he was attacked by a spinal disease, and died at Villa des Acacias, Aix-les-Bains, Savoie, on 22 September 1881; his remains were buried in London at Kensal Green cemetery. Eyre was a man of noble character. Handsome, courteous, accomplished, daring, and resourceful, he combined literary and artistic talent with his military qualities.<br>
