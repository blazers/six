<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (1546?&#150;1622), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was probably born at his father's house in Noble Street, London, the fifth of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1002/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510&#150;1579)")</script>, lord keeper, and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1552), daughter of Thomas Ferneley, a merchant from West Creeting, Suffolk. His half-brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/988/', "Anthony Bacon (1558&#150;1601)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/990/', "Francis Bacon (1561&#150;1626), later Viscount St Alban")</script>. Educated under his father's watchful eye, he matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1561 and entered Gray's Inn in December 1562, becoming an ancient in November 1576. In July 1569 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1594), the illegitimate child of a liaison between his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11505/', "Sir Thomas Gresham")</script> and Anne Dutton. Their respective fathers endowed them with a fragmented estate of seven manors ranging from Stiffkey and Langham-cum-Morston in north Norfolk to Combs in east Suffolk. In the early 1590s these manors were yielding an annual income of about &pound;2000, declining thereafter through the sale of Combs to finance dowries for his three heirs, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66940/', "Townshend, Anne")</script>], Elizabeth, and Winefred.<br>
<br>In 1578 Bacon settled at Stiffkey Hall where, for over forty years, he devoted himself to the business of county government. Appointed JP in 1573, he remained on the bench until his death. Twice sheriff of Norfolk (1586&#150;7 and 1599&#150;1600), commissioner for musters (1596&#150;1605), and deputy lieutenant (1605&#150;22), he served variously as commissioner for the export of grain, for piracy, sewers, recusancy, subsidies, loans, and the impressment of mariners. Appointed deputy steward of the duchy of Lancaster estates in Norfolk in 1582, he succeeded to the stewardship in 1599, renting the valuable manor of Methwold where he became feodary, coroner, escheator, and clerk of the market in 1604. The unrivalled collection of records that these offices generated has been exploited by historians of Elizabethan and Jacobean government to exemplify an assiduous magistracy dedicated to the service of the state. Bacon's assiduity is not in doubt, but his dedication appears to have been directed more to implementing his own analysis of what best suited his &#145;country&#146; (by which he usually meant north Norfolk) than to acting as the handmaid of central government.<br>
<br>Bacon epitomized a type of Elizabethan county magnate who, schooled in mid-Tudor common weal humanism, considered himself better placed than the state to decide what constituted good government in his locality. In Norfolk, which had two contrasting identities&#151;the sheep and corn areas of the north and west and the wood-pasture of the centre and south&#151;Bacon became spokesman for the former, where residence acquainted him with its economic and social problems. For their alleviation he advocated the repeal or amendment of a raft of government measures; some of these dealt with the export and marketing of grain. Others, particularly militia statutes, had introduced a rating system which fell inequitably on many parishes in his region. Such advocacy set him at loggerheads with his counterparts in south Norfolk where a different socio-economic structure pertained. Simultaneously he became involved in a bitter controversy as to whether county government, hitherto conducted by statutorily empowered magistrates and commissioners, should be buttressed by the intrusive activities of informers, deputy lieutenants, and patentees acting under the authority of the crown. In his view they were abusing the crown's power, acting arbitrarily and placing private gain before the public good; to thwart them he invoked legal and constitutional arguments and devices. Whatever the merits or success of his case, the discourse and debate he provoked began to transform the factions and affinities of mid-Tudor Norfolk into political groups that pursued particularist policies.<br>
<br>Although well connected at court through his family, Bacon rarely exploited the patronage network this offered. Instead he chose quarter sessions, the assizes, and parliament as the arenas in which he pursued the interests of his &#145;country&#146;. Having served his parliamentary apprenticeship as burgess for Tavistock, Devon, in 1571 and 1572, he sat as second knight of the shire for Norfolk in 1584 and 1593, burgess for King's Lynn, Norfolk, in 1597, and first knight of the shire in 1604. Esteemed by his electoral supporters as &#145;a speciall phisytion that will put his best indevour to purge and cure those maladies&#146; of his country  (Smith, 315), he arrived at Westminster furnished with a sheaf of draft bills which embodied the nostrums of his neighbours. His frequent contributions to debates and his regular nomination to serve on committees (at least twenty-five) suggest that he earned their trust and undoubtedly articulated his own views on economic, social, and religious issues.<br>
<br>His puritan beliefs made Bacon an outspoken critic of church government, especially of the practices and procedures of the church courts. &#145;The office of bishops is to preach&#146;, he told the Commons during a debate on a <span class="roman">Bill to Search for Recusants</span>:<blockquote>for they and their officers beeing men utterly unacquaynted with theis proceedinges, or being no parte of their studie or exercise, it were not fit to use them in this cause, but to leave it to the justices of the peace and others of the laitie. (LPL, MS 2109)</blockquote>A zealous favourer of moderate puritanism, he envisaged a society in which magistrates and ministers worked together to create a godly common weal. Such a view provided the imperative for his proactive magistracy, for the care he took to appoint preaching ministers, and for the institution of a weekly &#145;exercise&#146; and conference led by local preachers, which continued for at least fifteen years at Wiveton, a coastal parish adjacent to his estate.<br>
<br>By the time Bacon was knighted in 1604 his reforming zeal had ebbed, although he remained deeply involved in local administration. Or perhaps the changing nature of puritanism, coupled with the years of peace under James I with their attendant amelioration of local rating demands, deprived him of his mission. His domestic life, clouded by the death of his first wife in 1594, was plunged into turmoil by his unhappy marriage on 21 July 1597 to Dorothy (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1629), daughter of Arthur Hopton and widow of William Smith of Burgh Castle, Suffolk. She failed to give him the heir he so badly wanted. Temperamentally incompatible, they quarrelled to the point where their servants talked openly of their &#145;great falling out&#146;. Of his two stepsons, William Roberts, whom he planned to make his proxy heir by marriage to one of his granddaughters, and for whom he built Irmingland Hall, died aged sixteen, while Owen threatened to sue him for abusing his guardianship. Finally in 1620 the county rejected him as knight of the shire and even his heirs failed to inscribe his date of death, November 1622, on the tomb that he had commissioned in 1614.<br>
<br>Although he had inherited his father's industry and sense of responsibility, Bacon lacked his wit and wisdom. Self-righteous and plain-speaking to the point of tactlessness, an &#145;almost obsessive constitutionalist&#146; who was dubbed &#145;Mr Lawier&#146; by his sharp-tongued stepmother (MacCulloch, 260; <span class="italic">Papers of Nathaniel Bacon</span>, <span class="italic">Papers</span>, 3.20), and not given to sociability, he was referred to affectionately by his friends as &#145;honest Nathaniel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Philip Gawdy</span>, 65). Although he possessed a well-stocked library, he showed little interest in cultural pursuits, while his failure to complete the house and gardens that his father had designed suggests that he had no appreciation of the Renaissance features incorporated in their plan. He died at Stiffkey Hall and was buried at Stiffkey on 7 November 1622.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_1003"></a><span class="headword">Sir Nicholas Bacon</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1543&#150;1624)<span class="occ"></span>, was the third child of Sir Nicholas Bacon and his wife Jane. Admitted fellow-commoner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1561, he entered Gray's Inn on 15 December 1562, becoming an ancient in 1576. About 1562 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1616), daughter and heir of Edmund Butts of Thornham, Norfolk, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1609), daughter of Henry Bures of Acton, Suffolk. Through her he inherited substantial estates in north Norfolk and on the Suffolk&#150;Essex border. From his father he received the mansion house at Redgrave, Suffolk, together with at least seven other manors. In 1586 he added by purchase the Culford Hall estate. It has been estimated that at death his annual income exceeded &pound;4000. Such an inheritance, combined with the residual aura of his distinguished father, might be expected to have ensured his pre-eminence in a region that, after 1572, lacked a resident nobleman.<br>
<br>Bacon's political impact, however, never quite matched his socio-economic status since he lacked both the aspiration and the necessary application. He sat twice in parliament&#151;for Beverley, Yorkshire, in 1563 and as first knight of the shire for Suffolk in 1572&#151;&#145;without once being mentioned in the records&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>,). Despite this tardiness he was tireless in local administration. Sheriff of Suffolk in 1581&#150;2, of Norfolk in 1597&#150;8, and of Suffolk again in 1603&#150;4, JP in Suffolk from 1573 and in Norfolk from 1578 almost continuously until 1624, he served on numerous special commissions and was steward of the honours of Eye and Clare. Knighted in 1578, he was appointed premier baronet of England in 1611.<br>
<br>Bacon's paramount concern was for good government within the liberty of St Edmund's, west Suffolk. When its landowners felt threatened during the 1590s by patentees' and lieutenancy exactions, he consorted with other justices within the liberty to flout what they deemed to be excessive demands by central government and its agents. A staunch patron of puritan ministers, he died on 22 November 1624, and was commemorated in Redgrave church by one of Nicholas Stone's monumental masterpieces.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_989"></a><span class="headword">Edward Bacon</span>  (1548/9&#150;1618)<span class="occ"></span>, the sixth child of Sir Nicholas Bacon, matriculated (according to Venn) at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1561, aged twelve. In 1565 he entered Gray's Inn where he became ancient in 1576. His father set him up, as befitted a younger son, as a London-based agent complete with town house and a clerkship in chancery for licences and pardons of alienations (1571). A failed marriage suit in 1576 probably precipitated a two-year continental tour in which he reinforced his humanistic and radical protestant sympathies through studies under Johann Sturmius at Strasbourg and Lambert Danaeus at Geneva, while lodging in Beza's house.<br>
<br>About 1581 Edward Bacon married Helen, daughter and heir of Thomas Little of Bray, Berkshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lyton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. Among their children were the politician and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1000/', "Nathaniel Bacon (bap. 1593, d. 1660)")</script> and the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69745/', "Francis Bacon (1600&#150;1663)")</script>. Initially, presumably, he lived at Bray, since he served as a JP in Berkshire between 1583 and 1591. Elected burgess for Yarmouth in a by-election (1576), he sat for Tavistock, Devon, in 1584 and Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in 1586. By 1592 his wife had inherited Shrubland Hall, Barham, where he settled and lent support to both the puritan cause and county government in Suffolk. Although he is frequently confused with his nephew Edmund Bacon, the record clearly shows him as JP there between 1592 and 1609 and sheriff in 1600&#150;01. Arguably he may also have sat as knight of the shire in 1593. He died at Shrubland Hall on 8 September 1618 and was buried in Barham church.<br>
