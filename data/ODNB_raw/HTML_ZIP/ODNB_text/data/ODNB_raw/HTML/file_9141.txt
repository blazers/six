<span class="headword">Fane, Sir  Ralph</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1510, <em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born by 1510, being about twenty-three in 1533, the illegitimate son of John Fane, and nephew of Henry Fane (<i>d</i>. 1533) of Hadlow in Kent. At his death Henry left lands and a house to Ralph, who was then about twenty-three. Ralph Fane sought to enhance his prospects further through service. He was a servant of Thomas Cromwell from 1531 until 1538 and may have finished his education in the latter's household. Cromwell recommended him to Henry VIII in 1538 and he was appointed a gentleman pensioner in 1540 and then lieutenant in 1545. He was highly regarded and a capable soldier. The king rewarded him with grants of land, stewardships, and other offices, including chief governor of Cage and Postern parks in Kent. By 1540 Fane had married Elizabeth Brydges (<i>d</i>. 1568) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68050/', "Fane, Elizabeth")</script>], literary patron, daughter and heir of Roland Brydges of Clerkenwell, Middlesex, and The Ley, Weobley, Herefordshire, and his wife, Margery; they had no children. Fane obtained even more property at his father-in-law's death in 1540, acquiring livery of the lands in 1542. He was now a very wealthy man. In May 1544, during the siege of Boulogne, he was dispatched to Antwerp to recruit German and Dutch mercenaries. Put in charge of Christoph Landenberg's troops, he distinguished himself in battle and on 30 September was knighted by Henry at Boulogne.<br>
<br>Fane was a beneficiary under the king's will and was appointed joint-steward on 4 October 1547 with Sir William Goring of several Kent and Sussex estates administered by the crown until the majority of Henry Brandon, second duke of Suffolk. Earlier that year he had been appointed JP for Kent through the influence of his new patron, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI. Somerset had Fane elected MP to the 1547 parliament. Fane participated in the battle of Pinkie in September 1547 and captured George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly. He was created knight-banneret between 18 and 25 September for his services and continued to serve in the north during 1547&#150;8. He was a combative man, whose disputes alienated the Kent gentry. He was granted various manors in October 1547 and wrote to Somerset's steward, Sir John Thynne, in January 1548 to ask that his interests and especially his new grants be protected because of the &#145;good wille and service I have and yet do owe him [Somerset]&#146;  (Hatfield, Cecil MS 231, fol. 68<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). He believed the commonwealth needed further religious and social reform. On 14 February Fane was appointed with several others to supervise the dissolution of chantries and several religious foundations in Canterbury and elsewhere in Kent. He was rewarded for his military service on 22 July 1550 with grants of lands belonging to the former collegiate foundation of St Stephen, Westminster, as well as crown property in Kent, once belonging to Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham.<br>
<br>In October 1551 Fane was accused of conspiring with Somerset against John Dudley, earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland, lord president of the privy council. Like Somerset's other military clients, Fane had offered practical support during 1550&#150;51. Also, he quarrelled with Northumberland over pasture rights to Postern Park in March 1551 and was briefly imprisoned as a result. He managed to avoid immediate capture on 16 October by fleeing from the court at Whitehall Palace and commented that Somerset was not bold enough but that &#145;if he could get home he cared for non of them all he was so strong&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Nero C. x, fol. 44<i>v</i>). His strong words belied the truth and he was found hiding in the stable of the Lambeth house of one of his servants. He was sent to the Tower of London with Somerset's other clients. Charged with plotting to murder Northumberland and other privy councillors, Fane was accused of high treason on 24 November. Among other improbable claims against him was that he had &#145;2000 men in readines&#146; to attack Somerset's enemies  (BL, Cotton MS Nero C.x, fol. 44<i>r</i>). Despite his past military record and his strong denial of the charges, he was tried on 27 January 1552 and sentenced to death. The king reported that at the trial Fane had been &#145;answering like a ruffian&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). On 25 February, Edward VI signed his death warrant. A day later Fane and another conspirator, Sir Miles Partridge, were hanged on Tower Hill, while Sir Thomas Arundell and Sir Michael Stanhope were beheaded at the same time. On the scaffold, Fane once again pleaded innocence, and is said to have added: &#145;my blood shall be the duke's [Northumberland's] bolster as long as he lives&#146;  (Camden, 307&#150;8). His lands fell to the crown and were immediately bestowed on prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of Northumberland, including Sir William Sidney, who received the manor of Penhurst, Kent, and Sir John Gates, who received other property at Westminster. Fane was probably executed as an example to the rest of Somerset's clientele.<br>
