<span class="headword">Cholmondeley,  George</span>, second earl of Cholmondeley  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;1733), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5346/', "Hugh Cholmondeley, first earl")</script>, was the second son of Robert Cholmondeley, Viscount Cholmondeley of Kells (<i>d</i>. 1681), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1692), the daughter and coheir of George Cradock of Caverswall Castle. He was educated at Westminster School and entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1680. He became in 1685 a cornet of horse, and in 1686 was promoted captain of the Queen Consort's regiment of horse. In 1688 he joined the northerners who under the earl of Devonshire assembled at Nottingham in support of the prince of Orange. On William's accession he was appointed groom of the bedchamber. He was MP for Newton from 1690 to 1695. As lieutenant-colonel, he commanded the Horse Grenadier Guards in 1690 at the battle of the Boyne, and distinguished himself in 1692 at Steenkerke. He was then promoted colonel of the first troop of Horse Grenadier Guards, with whom he served between 1693 and 1715. Later, on 17 June 1697, he was made brigadier-general of horse. About 1701 he married Elisabeth (<i>d</i>. 1722), the daughter of Heer van Ruytenburgh, governor of Sas van Ghent, and his wife, Anna Elisabeth, the daughter of Lewis of Nassau, lord of Auverquerk, field marshal of the forces of the states general; the couple had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>After the accession of Queen Anne, Cholmondeley was, on 1 July 1702, appointed major-general and governor of the forts of Tilbury and Gravesend. On 1 January 1704 he was promoted lieutenant-general of horse. Under George I he continued in his offices, and on 11 February 1715 was made captain and colonel of the third troop of Horse Guards. On 12 April 1715 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Newborough of Newborough, co. Wexford, Ireland, and on 10 July 1716 was created Baron Newburgh in the Isle of Anglesea. On succeeding his brother Hugh as earl of Cholmondeley, on 18 January 1725, he was appointed lord lieutenant of the county and city of Chester and <i>custos rotulorum</i> of the county; he was also lord lieutenant of north Wales. On 25 March 1725 he was appointed governor of the town and port of Kingston upon Hull and on 15 April 1727 general of the horse. In October 1732 he was named governor of the island of Guernsey. He died at Whitehall on 7 May 1733 and was buried at Malpas, Cheshire, where he had lived, on 17 May.<br>
<br>Cholmondeley was the reputed author of &#145;Verses and a pastoral spoken by himself and William Savile, second son of George, earl (afterwards marquis) of Halifax, before the duke and duchess of York and Lady Anne, in Oxford Theatre, 21 May 1683&#146;, printed in a book entitled <span class="italic">Examen poeticum</span> by Jacob Allestry in 1693. According to Wood, Allestry had &#145;the chief hand in making the verses and pastorals&#146;. Cholmondeley received the degree of DCL at Oxford on 1 November 1695.<br>
<br>Cholmondeley's second surviving son, <a name="cosubject_69783"></a><span class="headword">James Cholmondeley</span>  (1708&#150;1775)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 18 April 1708, commissioned in the 2nd troop of Life Guards in 1725, and promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd troop in 1731. In 1741 he was raised to the colonelcy of the 48th regiment of foot, from which he was transferred to the 34th (Cumberland) regiment in 1742. He accompanied the regiment to Flanders in 1744 and was present at Fontenoy in 1745. At the outbreak of the Jacobite rising he returned to England, and as major-general took charge of two battalions brought over from Ireland. On the retreat of the Scottish army from Derby he was attached to General Wade's army and commanded a brigade of infantry at the battle of Falkirk (17 January 1746). It was there that he distinguished himself. When four of the front-line royalist regiments turned and ran, Cholmondeley's brigade stood fast on the right flank and proceeded to pour heavy fire on the advancing Scots, forcing them to retire. Further attempts by Cholmondeley to organize a counter-attack were prevented only by the approach of night and a heavy storm. The stand made by Cholmondeley's brigade prevented the fleeing English troops from being cut to ribbons, turning an abject defeat into a valuable draw; it enabled the royalist army to proceed later to Culloden, where Cholmondeley's regiment formed part of the front rank of Cumberland's army. He provided a detailed description of the battle at Falkirk in a letter to Edward Weston of 21 January 1746. In 1749 he transferred to the 12th dragoons and later that year to the 3rd Irish horse. In 1750 he became colonel of the 6th dragoons and in 1754 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. For many years he was governor of Chester. He married Penelope, the daughter of James Barry, fourth earl of Barrymore, and died, childless, on 13 October 1775.<br>
