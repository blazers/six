<span class="headword">Bastin,  (Alfred) Harold</span>  (1875&#150;1962), <span class="occ">entomologist and photographer</span>, was born at 48 Lower Union Street, Torquay, on 7 July 1875, the son of Richard Bastin (1849&#150;1917), an ironmonger, and his wife, Priscilla Barter (1850&#150;1933), originally from Reading. He had a Quaker upbringing and the family (of two sons and two daughters) moved between Alton and Reading in the decade 1878&#150;88 before finally settling in his mother's home town (although his restless father continued to reside elsewhere for long periods). Schooled in Alton and in Reading, Bastin's interest in insects was developed through visits to the department of entomology at the British Museum (Natural History), London. By 1903 he had established an entomology business in Reading with his younger brother, Leonard (1880&#150;1947). On 4 July 1905 Bastin married, at Altrincham in Cheshire, Ellen Mary (1873&#150;1971), daughter of Alfred Taylor, a clergyman, and a sister of Alfred Edward Taylor (1869&#150;1965), professor of moral philosophy at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh. Bastin's brother, Leonard, left Reading around this time, and by 1909 Bastin had moved to 7 Upper Redlands Road. A son and daughter were both born in Reading and for a period of over forty years Bastin made a living from model making, photography, and writing.<br>
<br>Bastin's models illustrated the life history of insects and the damage caused by insect pests and plant diseases, and he developed a technique for reproducing artificial flowers and leaves from wax-filled moulds. He supplied models to various museums, schools, and other institutions, including Reading and Bristol museums, the British Museum (Natural History), Charterhouse School, the Royal Horticultural Society, and Sutton's Seeds of Reading. A notable example of his skill was the cabinet of economic insects commissioned by Professor F. J. Cole for the department of zoology at the University of Reading (later displayed in the Cole Museum of Zoology). Bastin also became a professional photographer and assembled an extensive commercial negative library covering all aspects of natural history, among which entomology continued to occupy a prime place. His range of subjects also extended to scenes of farming, rural industries, and town and country life in the southern counties of England. His photographs of woodland industries taken before the 1920s are of a remarkable quality and provide a valuable record of trades now extinct in their traditional form.<br>
<br>Bastin employed his photographs to illustrate his books, the products of a writing career of over forty years. His first work, <span class="italic">Insects: their Life-Histories and Habits</span> (1913) set out the aim he was to follow in all his writing on insects: &#145;An attempt is made to set forth in simple terms the salient facts on entomology&#146;. This was followed by <span class="italic">British Insects, and How to Know them</span> (1917), <span class="italic">Introducing British Butterflies</span> (1937), and three final volumes published in <span class="roman">Hutchinson's Nature Library</span>, <span class="italic">Freaks and Marvels of Insect Life</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Plants without Flowers</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">Insect Communities</span> (1956). Several of his books were translated into other European languages, including German, and appeared in American editions; he also contributed to other works.<br>
<br>Bastin died of heart failure on 22 March 1962 at 36 St Catherine's Road, Southbourne and was cremated at Bournemouth crematorium on 27 March. He had always been a retiring man and his death away from his adopted home of Reading, where he had lived for over seventy years, passed virtually unnoticed. Nevertheless, he impressed his contemporaries, and Richard Ford of Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, described him as &#145;a wonderful naturalist and observer of entomology&#146;  (private information). He began his career in an era of widespread popular enthusiasm for the practice of natural history, before entomology became a more specialized pursuit and before the practice of collecting and selling specimens from the wild had lost favour. Bastin's principal achievement was that of a popularizer of natural history through his books, photographs, and models, which ensured that his meticulous craftsmanship and powers of observation were recorded and transmitted to the benefit of others.<br>
