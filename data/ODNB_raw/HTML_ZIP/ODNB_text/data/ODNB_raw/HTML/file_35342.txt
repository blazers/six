<span class="headword">Ott&eacute;,  Elise Charlotte</span>  (1818&#150;1903), <span class="occ">linguist and historian</span>, was born in Copenhagen on 30 September 1818. Nothing is known of her father beyond his surname and the fact that he was Danish, nor of her mother save that she was English and called Mary Anne. In 1820 Elise's parents went to Santa Cruz in the Danish West Indies, where her father died. Her mother returned to Copenhagen, where she met the English philologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27375/', "Benjamin Thorpe")</script> who was studying in Denmark. She married Thorpe and they set up home with Elise in England. Thorpe taught Elise several modern languages and from a very early age she knew enough Anglo-Saxon and Icelandic to help him in his work. Edmund Gosse paints a particularly unattractive picture of Thorpe, &#145;a pedant of the narrowest description, and a captious taskmaster&#146; whose &#145;demands upon his young stepdaughter's time and labour became more than her patience could endure&#146;  (Gosse, 15). According to him it was to escape Thorpe's tyranny that Miss Ott&eacute; in 1840 fled secretly to Boston, Massachusetts. Gosse's picture of Thorpe is qualified by E. S. Day, of whose family Miss Ott&eacute; was a long-standing friend  (Day, 83). Whatever the cause, Miss Ott&eacute; went to Boston to teach in a family. She became interested in the transcendental movement and was invited to join the Brook Farm experiment, but declined. Instead she turned to science and attended lectures on geology, physiology, and anatomy at Harvard. She then moved to Europe and settled at Frankfurt in the family of a professor for whom she translated English scientific monographs into German. After returning to England she resumed her work with her stepfather, whom she helped to prepare his translation of the elder or poetic <span class="roman">Edda</span>, <span class="italic">Edda S&aelig;mundar hinns Fr&ocirc;&eth;a</span> (1866). According to Gosse she again found &#145;the bondage intolerable&#146;, and in 1849 went to St Andrews, to the family of Professor George Edward Day, for whom she translated scientific works and who helped her with the scientific aspects of her published translations. In 1863 she moved with Day and his wife to Torquay, and she helped to nurse Day during his final illness.<br>
<br>In 1872, after Day's death, Miss Ott&eacute; moved to London, where she wrote for scientific periodicals and published literary works. Her <span class="italic">Scandinavian History</span> (1874), proved popular and was reprinted many times as <span class="italic">Norway, Sweden and Denmark</span> until as late as 1939. It and <span class="italic">Denmark and Iceland</span> (1881) show careful scholarship and are based on primary and secondary sources in several languages. Contemporary reviewers, knowing them to be by a woman, felt them too serious, and in 1912 Gosse remarked that she never acquired ease in literary expression  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). To a later reader, however, her style seems at once authoritative and pleasingly direct. She is entirely at ease with Scandinavian terms and writes with the lucid sparseness characteristic of good Scandinavian prose. Her loyalty to Scandinavia and her refusal to conform to feminine stereotypes come across forcefully in her scathing treatment of Queen Kristina and her meddlesome mother. She compiled grammars of Danish (1884) and of Swedish (1884) and textbooks for students of German (1859) and Danish (1879). In addition she translated from the German works by Alexander von Humboldt (<span class="italic">Views of Nature</span>, 1850, and <span class="italic">Cosmos</span>, 5 vols., 1849&#150;58), Reinhold Pauli (<span class="italic">Pictures of Old England</span>, 1861), and J. M. Lappenberg (<span class="italic">A History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings</span>, 1881); and from the French a work on natural history by Quatrefages de Br&eacute;au (<span class="italic">The Rambles of a Naturalist on the Coast of Spain, France and Sicily</span>, 1857). The influence of her stepfather was ever present in her work: her translation of Pauli's work was dedicated to him and her edition of Lappenberg's work was a revision of Thorpe's earlier translation. Her translations of complex works in several academic disciplines represent a considerable intellectual achievement. Gosse considered her one of the most learned women of her time, whose erudition showed best in her &#145;copious and marvellously illuminating&#146; conversation  (Gosse, 15). For many years she was incapacitated by pain caused by curvature of the spine. She died unmarried at her home, 160 Sheen Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 20 December 1903.<br>
