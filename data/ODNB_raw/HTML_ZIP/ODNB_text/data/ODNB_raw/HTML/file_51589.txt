<span class="headword">Cannon, Sir  Leslie</span>  (1920&#150;1970), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 21 February 1920 in Cudworth Street, Wigan, Lancashire, the fourth of seven children born to James (Jim) Cannon, a miner, and his wife, Ellen (Nellie) Turner. He was brought up in poverty in Wigan between the wars. His father worked only sporadically after being victimized following the general strike of 1926. Family income came from temporary work such as newspaper rounds and selling firewood done by Cannon and his brothers. Les Cannon always acknowledged the influence of his father, who was a bookish man, joining the fledgeling Communist Party in 1920 only to leave it later over a dispute within the party over A. J. Cook, the miners' leader.<br>
<br>Cannon won a scholarship to the Junior Technical School of Wigan and District Mining and Technical, but left aged fifteen to work as a van delivery boy. However, he was accepted a year later as an apprentice electrician by Wigan corporation. During his apprenticeship, he successfully studied at Wigan Technical College to ordinary national certificate level.<br>
<br>Cannon joined the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) on 1 May 1936, and the Communist Party in 1939. Both his trade union and political views were influenced heavily by the triumph of fascism in Europe. However, he took little part in union or political affairs before 1941. He worked in a reserved occupation in the Tyneside shipyards, exempted from military service due to ear infections. He returned to Wigan in 1941 after Russia entered the war, and began a meteoric rise in the union at the same time as its leadership fell under communist influence nationally.<br>
<br>Elected district secretary of the union in 1942, and to the national executive in 1945 aged twenty-five, Cannon was re-elected unopposed for his Lancashire seat at every election until 1954, when he became the ETU's education officer at its shop steward training college at Esher in Surrey. As a young communist &#145;high-flyer&#146; within a communist-dominated union, he was spokesman on many key issues for the union in the period 1946&#150;54 as the cold war intensified. Other unions resented the ETU for acting as a frequent spokesman for the Communist Party view of international and domestic affairs, often contradicting official Labour policy. Cannon's contribution to this period was especially influential in raising questions about the new discipline of &#145;work study&#146;, the social usefulness of automation, the need for the Communist Party to affiliate to the Labour Party, youth issues, and support for East European &#145;workers' states&#146;. It was in this context that he met and quickly married his wife, Olga Julinava, in Czechoslovakia on 25 August 1947. Communist Party secretary Harry Pollitt was to be best man, but because of the short notice Willie Gallagher MP officiated instead. Two sons were born, Oleg in 1950 and Martin in 1952.<br>
<br>While teaching at Esher from 1954 to 1957 Cannon's disillusion with the Communist Party developed. First, he returned to his father's view that Britain was too wedded to the Labour Party/trade union tradition to make a Leninist approach to political change in Britain possible. Second, his wife's family in Czechoslovakia were cruelly treated by the communist authorities, despite Cannon's influence within the highest echelons of the British Communist Party. Third, he resented some of the cruder power politics within the ETU. The Communist Party leadership of the ETU had failed to defend him when he was dismissed in 1950 from English Electric in Lancashire after a strike, and the union never paid him what he expected when he gave up his executive council seat to go to Esher.<br>
<br>Cannon was especially moved by Khrushchov's speech to the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1956, in which Stalin's crimes were first revealed. Cannon's suggested reform documents were sent to the British Communist Party just as the invasion of Hungary by Soviet troops prompted large numbers of communists to leave the party.<br>
<br>Cannon resigned from the party in November 1956. His communist opponents set about isolating him. He lost his job at Esher College in April 1957 when the ETU leadership shut the college for financial reasons, following the union's expenditure incurred during the 1957 engineering strikes. He was forced back into being an electrician.<br>
<br>Instead of taking up a different job&#151;perhaps in the law, which already interested him&#151;Cannon set about opposing the Communist Party leadership of the ETU. He was greatly assisted in this by the events in Hungary, which brought together similar-minded former communists in the union such as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94307/', "Frank Chapple")</script> and Mark Young. There was also growing media interest in the communist domination of the ETU. Cannon had an immediate focus for opposition, as an executive council election was due in south-east England. The seat was held by Communist Party member Jack Frazer, seen by many as the successor to the president of the union, Frank Foulkes. Five years earlier, Cannon would have been that obvious choice.<br>
<br>This 1957 election was rigged in favour of Frazer, as was later demonstrated in court. Cannon, who himself failed to gain election in 1957, toured the union's branches with sympathetic colleagues for three years amassing evidence on the methods used by the communists to corrupt ETU elections that would convince a court. The election to the ETU general secretaryship in 1959 was also rigged, and Cannon and John Byrne, district secretary in Glasgow, issued writs for alleged fraud. When their case was heard by the High Court in 1961, Mr Justice Winn declared the election void. This led to fair elections and the eventual defeat of the disgraced communists. Cannon was reinstated at Esher. In 1963 he was elected president of the union by a huge majority, and re-elected in 1968. Success was assured when he reformed the union in tandem with Frank Chapple, the new ETU general secretary.<br>
<br>Cannon's period in office was short, but his impact enormous. He initiated revolutionary negotiating priorities to raise the standard of living for skilled craftsmen. In electrical contracting and the electricity supply industry he introduced productivity-based negotiations. In 1965 he was elected to the TUC general council, where he supported an incomes policy but only as far as it flexibly rewarded those who had higher skills. He gave evidence to the 1965 royal commission on trade unions and employer organizations, suggesting radical changes in trade union structure and purpose. Within the ETU he abolished the mechanisms through which the Communist Party had controlled the union and led the way to merger with the plumbing trades union in 1968. He sat on the Industrial Reorganization Corporation, which attempted structural reform of British companies, and the National Economic Development Council.<br>
<br>Cannon's manner was readily abrasive, sometimes interpreted as arrogance, and his preferred style was often combative on behalf of the issues he cared about. He led the most bitter struggle to rescue the democratic integrity of a union and prevent, by example, such corruption gaining a widespread hold within the labour movement. He showed how unions could contribute intellectual resources in modernizing out-of-date work practices. Cannon died of cancer at the Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, on 9 December 1970. His knighthood was gazetted in the new year honours list in 1971.<br>
