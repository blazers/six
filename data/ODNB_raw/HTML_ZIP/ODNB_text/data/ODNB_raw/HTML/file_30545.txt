<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Benjamin</span>  (1840&#150;1907), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Keyford, Frome, Somerset, on 31 March 1840, the son of Benjamin Baker and Sarah Hollis. His father, a native of co. Carlow, Ireland, became principal assistant at ironworks at Tondu, Glamorgan. After being educated at Cheltenham grammar school, Baker was for four years (1856&#150;60) apprentice at Price and Fox's Neath Abbey ironworks. At this time he had an affair with a young Welsh woman, with whom he had an illegitimate daughter. Her parents emigrated with their daughter to America, and Baker was ignorant of the birth for eight years.<br>
<br>Baker moved to London in 1860 to join the staff of William Wilson, a business associate of John Fowler, working on the construction of the Grosvenor Road railway bridge and Victoria Station. On completion of the work he joined Fowler's staff. Fowler persuaded Baker that his talents had a future in Britain when early in his career he contemplated emigrating to the colonies; he became Fowler's partner in 1875, and was associated with him until Fowler's death in 1898. As a consulting engineer Baker rapidly gained the highest reputation for skill and knowledge, and was consulted by the British and Egyptian governments, by colonial administrations, and by local and other authorities. The credit for the design and execution of the great civil engineering achievements with which Baker's name is associated was necessarily shared by him with Fowler and many other colleagues, but Baker's judgement and resource were highly important factors in the success of these undertakings.<h2>
<a name="Londonsundergroundrailways"></a>London's underground railways</h2>In the 1860s Fowler was heavily involved with the underground railway system of London. As assistant in Fowler's office, Baker was employed on the construction of the Metropolitan Railway, its St John's Wood extension. In 1869 he became Fowler's chief assistant in the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway from Westminster to Mansion House. In his 1881 paper, &#145;The actual lateral pressure of earthwork&#146;, he discussed some fruits of this experience  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 65, 1880&#150;81, 140&#150;241), and described the work itself in 1885  (B. Baker, &#145;The Metropolitan and Metropolitan District railways&#146;, <span class="italic">PICE</span>, 81, 1884&#150;5, 1&#150;33). Subsequently Fowler and Baker acted as consulting engineers for the first &#145;tube&#146; railway the City and South London Line, opened in 1890 (later part of the Northern Line), and with J. H. Greathead were the joint engineers for the Central London Railway, opened in 1900. In the construction of this line Baker carried out the plan suggested by him in 1874, of making the line dip down between the stations in order to reduce the required tractive effort. This subsequently became standard practice on tube railways. After Greathead's death in 1896 Baker also acted as joint engineer with W. R. Galbraith for the Baker Street and Waterloo (Bakerloo) Railway . Almost his last act before his death was to attend the opening of the Euston&#150;Angel extension of the City and South London Railway; Basil Mott and David Hay were his partners in work on this project.<h2>
<a name="TheForthBridge"></a>The Forth Bridge</h2>In the early years of his career Baker began to study structural theory and the strength of materials. For <span class="italic">Engineering</span> he wrote a series of articles on long span bridges in 1867, and another, on the strength of beams, columns, and arches, in 1868. Both series were published in book form, as was his paper on the lateral pressure of earthwork. A third series, on the strength of brickwork, was written in 1872. These publications established Baker's international reputation, and were extensively abstracted and translated. In the work on long span bridges, published at a time when Fowler's practice was actively considering a major crossing of the Severn, Baker concluded that the longest span could be achieved using cantilevers supporting an independent girder. This system was finally adopted for the Forth railway bridge. To his early training in the Neath Abbey ironworks he owed the foundation of his thorough knowledge of the properties and strength of metals, on which he wrote many papers. Baker's technical writings displayed a rare ability to illustrate engineering principles in a way which even a lay audience could understand. This was seen, for example, in his illustration of the cantilever principle by a human model in his lectures on the Forth railway bridge. This specialist knowledge enabled him to play a principal part in association with Fowler in the design of the Forth Bridge. This, the longest span bridge in the world at the time, was begun in 1883 and completed in 1890. Baker worked almost continuously on site, carrying out numerous tests on the steelwork and research into wind pressure. His services were rewarded by the honour of KCMG (17 April 1890) and the prix Poncelet of the Institut de France. The success of the bridge paved the way for the widespread use of structural steel.<h2>
<a name="EgyptandtheAswanDam"></a>Egypt and the Aswan Dam</h2>From 1869 Baker was also associated with Fowler in investigating and advising upon engineering projects in Egypt. One of these was for a railway between Wadi Halfa and Shendi and a ship incline at Aswan, and another was a project for a sweet-water canal between Alexandria and Cairo, which was never built.<br>
<br>For the remainder of his life Baker played a prominent part in the engineering work which distinguished British involvement in Egypt in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was consulted by the Egyptian government on various occasions on the repair of the Nile delta barrage and when, after several years' investigation, schemes were prepared by Sir William Willcocks in 1894 for the storage of the waters of the Nile for irrigation purposes, Baker was appointed to the commission which approved the project for a reservoir at Aswan and chose a site for the dam. To meet objections to the partial submergence by this plan of the temples at Philae, the height of the proposed dam was reduced from 85 to 65 feet. The work, for which Baker was consulting engineer, was begun in 1898 and was completed in 1902, when Baker was made KCB and was appointed to the order of the Mejidiye. The dam was 6400 feet in length, pierced by 180 sluice openings at different levels. Baker was also consulting engineer for a subsidiary dam which was built at the same time at Asyut, below Aswan. When the contractors, John Aird &amp; Sons, had this work well in hand, with a large part of their contract time to run, Baker, realizing the advantages of early completion of the dam, advised the Egyptian government to cancel the contract and to instruct the contractors to finish the work at the earliest possible moment, regardless of cost, leaving the question of contractors' profit to be settled by him. His advice was followed, the work was completed a year early, and the value of the extra year's supply of water was estimated to be &pound;600,000. The Aswan Reservoir was from the first found to be inadequate to meet demand and as no suitable site could be found for another reservoir above the site, it was decided to raise the dam there to about the height originally proposed by Willcocks. Baker solved the difficult problem of uniting new to old masonry so as to form a solid structure by building the upper portion of the dam as an independent structure which could be united to the lower by grouting with cement when it had ceased to settle and contract. Just before his death he went to Egypt to settle the plans for this work (completed in 1912), as well as preliminary plans for a bridge across the Nile at Bulaq.<h2>
<a name="Otherworks"></a>Other works</h2>Smaller but important works which Baker also undertook included: the vessel which he designed with John Dixon in 1877 to transport Cleopatra's Needle from Egypt to England, a project which first brought his name to the notice of the general public  (&#145;Cleopatra's Needle&#146;, <span class="italic">PICE</span>, 61.233); the Chignecto Rhip Railway, for which Fowler and Baker were consulting engineers, commenced in 1888 and abandoned in 1891 owing to financial difficulties; the Avonmouth docks (in association with Sir John Wolfe Barry, 1902&#150;8); the Rosslare and Waterford Railway; the widening of the Buccleuch Dock entrance at Barrow; and the construction of the bascule bridges at Walney (Barrow in Furness) and across the Swale near Queenborough.<br>
<br>Baker gave much professional advice on structures at home and abroad. He advised on three important works of Thomas Telford&#151;the Menai Bridge, Buildwas Bridge, and Over Bridge at Gloucester&#151;doing much to ensure their survival. He acted as consultant with Allan Duncan Stewart (1831&#150;1894), who had earlier assisted in the Forth railway bridge design, on the Wembley Tower project, conceived as the tallest structure in the world but soon abandoned. When the roof of Charing Cross railway station collapsed on 5 December 1905 he at once examined it, at some personal danger, and gave useful advice. He had earlier been consulted by Captain J. B. Eads in connection with the design of the St Louis Bridge across the Mississippi (1868) and in regard to the first Hudson river tunnel when the latter faced failure, he designed a pneumatic shield which enabled the work to be completed (1888&#150;91). His fame as a bridge engineer led to him acting jointly with Fowler as consultant to Schneider and Hersent's scheme for a cross-channel railway bridge. Nowhere were his abilities appreciated more highly than in Canada and the United States. He was an honorary member of both the Canadian and the American Societies of Civil Engineers and of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.<h2>
<a name="Governmentservice"></a>Government service</h2>Baker served from 1888 until his death on the ordnance committee, of which he became the senior civil member on the death of Sir Frederick Bramwell in 1903. He was active in many government inquiries and regularly gave evidence on parliamentary bills. He was a member of the committee on light railways in 1895, and of the committee appointed by the Board of Trade in 1900 to inquire into the loss of strength in steel rails. To the London county council he reported in 1891, with Alexander Binnie, on the main drainage of London, and in 1897, with George Frederick Deacon, on the supply of water to London from Wales. On Fowler's death in 1898 he retained many of Sir John's consultancies, maintaining the office at 2 Queen Square Place, Westminster, under the name of Baker and Hurtzig. His partner, Arthur Dameron Hurtzig, continued the practice after Baker's death. In addition Baker had a partnership with Frederick Shelford, acting as consultants to the crown agents.<br>
<br>Baker was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1867, a member in 1877, a member of council in 1882, and president in 1895, remaining on the council until his death. During his presidency the council was enlarged to give the membership overseas and outside London better representation and the system of election was modified. Baker was a major influence on the foundation of the Engineering Standards Committee, forerunner of the British Standards Institution, by ICE and the other leading engineering institutions. He helped draft the first British standards relating to bridges and building construction. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1890 and a member of its council in 1892&#150;3, and was one of its vice-presidents from 1896 until his death.<br>
<br>Baker was president of the mechanical science section of the British Association at Aberdeen in 1885. He was also active in the Royal Institution, in the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (on the council of which he sat from 1899 until death), in the Society of Arts, and in the Iron and Steel Institute. He was an associate of the Institution of Naval Architects and an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Honorary degrees were conferred upon him by the universities of Cambridge (DSc, 1900), Edinburgh (LLD, 1890), and Dublin (MEng, 1892).<br>
<br>Baker died suddenly from syncope at his home, Bowden Green, Pangbourne, on 19 May 1907, and was buried at Idbury, near Chipping Norton. He was unmarried and left the bulk of his estate to his sister, Mrs Fanny Maria Kemp, and her family.<br>
<br>A memorial window, designed by J. N. Comper, was unveiled by the earl of Cromer on 3 October 1909 in the north aisle of the nave of Westminster Abbey.<br>
