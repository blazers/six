<span class="headword">Richardson,  Mary Raleigh</span>  (1882/3&#150;1961), <span class="occ">suffragette and political activist</span>, though apparently born in Britain, was brought up by her Canadian mother in Belleville, Ontario, Canada, and her grandfather who was the local bank manager. She returned to Britain when she was sixteen, studying art and travelling to Paris and Italy. While living in Bloomsbury she undertook some freelance work as a journalist. A witness to the events of &#145;black Friday&#146; (18 November 1910), in which the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) lobbied parliament and were brutally attacked by the police, she joined the WSPU and quickly engaged in militant activities. She described this change in her life as enlisting &#145;in a holy crusade&#146;  (Richardson, <span class="italic">Laugh a Defiance</span>, 6). She was arrested nine times, serving several sentences in Holloway prison for assaulting the police, breaking windows, and arson. She was often physically attacked while campaigning for the suffrage cause: her shoulder blade was broken and her clothing torn to shreds when she presented a petition to George V in Bristol in 1913. She campaigned with the socialist Sylvia Pankhurst in east London and was arrested and then imprisoned with her after a rally in Bromley by Bow in July 1913. She apparently also carried out orders from Christabel Pankhurst to enact daring deeds. Mary Richardson was one of the first two women to be force fed, under the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span> in 1913, having been arrested at the scene of an arson attack. She suffered extensive bruising and poor health as a result, writing about this experience as &#145;torture&#146;: &#145;forcible feeding is an immoral assault as well as a painful physical one&#146;  (Richardson, <span class="italic">Personal Experience</span>). When released in 1914 after a long period of forcible feeding to be operated on for appendicitis, she declared, &#145;The worst fight on record since the movement began is now raging in Holloway&#146;  (C. Pankhurst, 286). Mary Richardson was not the first, but the most famous, suffragette to slash a painting as a political protest. On 10 March 1914 she attacked Vel&aacute;zquez's <span class="italic">The Toilet of Venus</span> (the &#145;Rokeby Venus&#146;), which had been acquired for the National Gallery through the National Art Collections Fund in 1906. She claimed that this act was perpetrated to draw attention to the plight of Emmeline Pankhurst, then on hunger strike in Holloway prison, saying, &#145;You can get another picture but you cannot get a life, as they are killing Mrs Pankhurst&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 March 1914). For Mary Richardson, the most beautiful woman in art was of little significance compared with the life of Mrs Pankhurst, &#145;the most beautiful character in modern history&#146;  (ibid.). This action secured her notoriety, and eighteen months with hard labour. It also led to many museums' closing their doors to unaccompanied women.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Mary Richardson resumed her literary career, publishing a novel, <span class="italic">Matilda and Marcus</span> (1915), and two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Symbol Songs</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">Wilderness Love Songs</span> (1917). Her third book of poetry, <span class="italic">Cornish Headlands</span>, appeared in 1920. In the 1920s and 1930s she stood several times as a parliamentary candidate. The first occasion was in November 1922 when she stood as Labour candidate in Acton, Middlesex, obtaining 26.2 per cent of the vote against the successful Conservative candidate. In October 1924 she stood for the same seat as an independent socialist against the official Labour candidate and received 7.6 per cent of the vote. Although adopted as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the rural constituency of Bury St Edmunds in 1926, she did not stand in the 1929 election. In 1931 she was adopted as a last-minute Labour candidate in Aldershot against Lord Wolmer, the National Government incumbent, and lost heavily.<br>
<br>Although Mary Richardson had approached Sylvia Pankhurst with the idea of establishing a communist nunnery for social and religious service, she subsequently continued in public political life. First she joined the New Party, formed by Sir Oswald Mosley in 1932, and then, in 1934, at a time of significant membership growth, she joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists (BUF)")</script> as the organizing secretary of its women's section. Like many British fascists, she had been impressed by the work of Mussolini in Italy. She spoke extensively for the British Union of Fascists and wrote regularly for the fascist press. She frequently drew analogies between the current work of British fascists and those of the militant suffrage feminists before the First World War, controversially interpreting her fascist politics as the logical outcome of her suffrage past, &#145;I was first attracted to the Blackshirts because I saw in them the courage, the action, the loyalty, the gift of service, and the ability to serve which I had known in the suffrage movement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blackshirt</span>, 29 June 1934, 3). She had left the BUF by 1935, having drawn hostility from Mosley's mother, who described her as full of &#145;dishonest inefficiency&#146;  (Mosley, 92).<br>
<br>Although single, after the First World War Mary Richardson adopted a son, Roger. In 1953 she published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Laugh a Defiance</span>, a sensationalist account of her time in the WSPU which was reticent about her later career. Mary Richardson died of heart failure and bronchitis, aged seventy-eight, on 7 November 1961 at her home in Hastings. Recently her time as a fascist has received attention from historians attempting to see the BUF as a movement in which feminist ideas were contested. Certainly in her autobiography she made no mention of this political activity and press coverage at the time of her death focused on her popular image as Slasher Mary.<br>
