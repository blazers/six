<span class="headword">Clark,  Margaret <span class="st"> [Margret]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">arsonist</span>, was born in Croydon, Surrey, the daughter of &#145;honest but mean parentage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Warning for Servants</span>, 1). She became a servant and was employed by several masters. By the end of January 1680 she had been with Peter Delanoy (De La Noy) a dyer, and &#145;a worthy and substantial person in Southwark&#146;  (ibid.), who lived in Montagu Close in the parish of St Saviour (also known as St Mary Overie) for some three months. On 1 February Delanoy and his family were away at his country retreat at Lee in Kent. That night three fires were started in his house. Margaret Clark and John Satterthwayt, a soldier in the duke of York's guards, were arrested, charged with arson, and brought to trial at the Surrey assizes at Kingston on 13 March. Satterthwayt was acquitted, but Clark was found guilty and hanged on 22 March 1680.<br>
<br>Clark had admitted the offence in the early hours of 2 February and two JPs, James Reading and John Freeman, had taken her deposition. She alleged that on 26 January she had been approached by Satterthwayt to let him into the house in order to set it on fire, and on the third meeting she had finally agreed to do it for &pound;2000. She had duly let him in and he had started three fires. However the neighbourhood had been alerted to the flames and the fire was put out. Suspicion fell upon Clark because she had salvaged a box claiming it to be her master's, which one of those present knew to be false. In it were several trinkets, but no plate or jewellery. Suspicion was reinforced by her dazed and faltering manner; brought before the magistrates she confessed after initial attempts at denial. Satterthwayt was picked up the following day from her description (she did not know his name); when brought before her she immediately identified him. Satterthwayt's defence to Clark's accusation was based on a detailed account of his movements before and during the crime. He was a member of the duke of York's guards which in the climate engendered by the Popish Plot only served to aggravate suspicions of him. However, his fellow guards vouched for his whereabouts in various taverns at the time he was meant to be at Delanoy's and his mother and uncle deposed that he was educated as a protestant. The jury believed him.<br>
<br>Clark went to her execution penitent, accepting her guilt, refusing to seek a pardon and protesting the truth of her allegations against Satterthwayt, repeated at length to several Anglican divines and her many visitors in gaol, and printed after her death in two pamphlets. <span class="italic">The True Confession of Margret Clark</span> (1680) was published by Joseph Collier. At its end it promised:<blockquote>A further account of her Behaviour in Prison, and what she delivered at her Execution, the Reader will have a fuller Narrative in a few days, with the Names of those Worthy Persons who were Eye and ear-witnesses of the whole Narrative. (<span class="italic">True Confession</span>, 6)</blockquote>This was duly provided the same year by <span class="italic">Warning for Servants, and a Caution to Protestants</span>.<br>
<br>The notoriety of the case prompted two other pamphlets, as well as being reported in the whig and tory press. Clark's story loomed large in the account of the three prisoners hanged at Kingston on 22 March. Satterthwayt (or a journalist purporting to be Satterthwayt) published a vindication of his innocence (<span class="italic">A True and Perfect Narrative of the Tryal and Acquitment of Mr. John Satterthwayt</span>), chronologically the first of the pamphlets. This detailed the testimony presented in court in his favour and presented him as a victim of the malice of the crown's enemies. &#145;I am a Gentleman&#146;, he declared, &#145;&hellip; and a Souldier, though it be an Imployment obnoxious to a sort of people in this Age, who are dis-satisfied that His Majesty has any Guard for the Security of his Person&#146;  (<span class="italic">True and Perfect Narrative</span>, 2). All the other pamphlets presented Clark's case that popish malignity was at the heart of the matter, a theme developed most fully in the <span class="italic">Warning for Servants</span>. When Clark had agreed to the arson Satterthwayt and his accomplices had tried to persuade her to go to a priest of theirs who would confess her and give her the sacrament. The preface of the <span class="italic">Warning</span> reminded its readers of &#145;the restless accursed endeavours of papists to ruine these Nations, and especially this Famous City and all its Suburbs&#146;. Their incendiary devices had set the City alight in 1666, and (taking up an allegation made by Titus Oates) after several attempts they had succeeded in burning down a substantial part of Southwark. Being &#145;subtil and politick&#146; they chose to keep in the background, seducing servants to burn down their master's houses. Delanoy's house was set:<blockquote>amongst abundance of old wooden, close Buildings, whence the devouring Flames, had they once got head (especially the House being fired in so many places) would easily have dispers'd themselves round about, and not only the Contiguous Alleys and Courts, but St Mary Overies stately Church, and the Houses on the Bridge. (<span class="italic">Warning for Servants</span>, 5)</blockquote>Margaret Clark's penitence was presented to move the reader, and to witness to the truth of her account: the dying words of a good protestant, who faced eternity and the stark choice of heaven or hell without the mitigating popish temptations to lie of absolution and purgatory. Clark's confession blamed her plight on her worldliness and desire to be better than her station in life: &#145;have a care of Pride and a worldly mind; for this, I say, Pride and Sabbath-breaking hath been my downfall&#146;  (<span class="italic">True Confession</span>, 5). Asked by a minister on the day of her execution whether she were &#145;of a pilfering humour&#146; and had set fire to the house to cover a robbery, she denied it, pointing out that she had had plenty of opportunities to steal from her master at much less risk  (<span class="italic">Warning for Servants</span>, 25&#150;6). Both the <span class="italic">Warning</span> and the account of the Kingston executions agreed in her penitence at the end:<blockquote>bathing herself in Tears, confessing to all that came to see her in Prison, that the Devil had deluded her and drawn her into his snare &hellip; and continued so penitent to the last, that notwithstanding the notorious Crime for which she was to suffer, she drew a general compassion from all or most of the Spectators, and so concluded her Life in a Flood of Tears. (<span class="italic">True Narrative</span>, 2)</blockquote>The <span class="italic">Warning</span> did feel the need to refute the claim of the tory journalist Nathaniel Thompson's attempt to discredit her penitence. He had claimed that at the end she had tried to avoid her fate by accepting the offer of a young man in the crowd to marry under the gallows, which according to very dubious tradition, would have spared her life.<br>
