<span class="headword">Irving, Sir  Edmund George</span>  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, was born on 5 April 1910 in Sandakan, British North Borneo, the elder child and only son of George Clerk Irving, resident magistrate, British North Borneo, and his wife, Ethel Mary Frances Poole, of Kimberley, South Africa. After arriving in England at the age of nine, Irving was sent to St Anthony's preparatory school, Eastbourne, before being accepted for the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1923. Because of his distinctly prominent nose he was known to his classmates as Beaky.<br>
<br>Irving went to sea as a cadet in HMS <i>Royal Oak</i> in 1927. After completing the sub-lieutenants' courses, in 1931 he joined the Royal Naval Surveying Service, in which he served for thirty-five years. On 14 March 1936 he married Margaret Scudamore (<i>d</i>. 1974), daughter of Richard Edwards, of Ipswich and Birmingham, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1941 Irving was mentioned in dispatches for his skill as navigating officer in HMS <i>Scott</i> when she was employed laying moored marker beacons in the Denmark strait (between Iceland and Greenland) to guide a squadron of British minelayers. While on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, Irving was again mentioned in dispatches for putting in place on the western side of the Strait of Messina three pairs of searchlights which, when illuminated vertically on the night of 2&#150;3 September 1943, formed three sets of transit marks to guide the British landing craft to their beaches in Reggio di Calabria.<br>
<br>In 1944, when in command of HMS <i>Franklin</i>, Irving resurveyed a number of heavily damaged ports and harbours in north-west Europe as they fell into allied hands. Finally, after his ship was berthed in Terneuzen, his surveys of the River Schelde enabled allied shipping to bring vital military supplies to Antwerp. For this he received not only appointment as OBE in 1944, but also the thanks of Field Marshal Montgomery, who visited the ship and, at Irving's suggestion, &#145;spliced the mainbrace&#146; (ordering the issue of an extra tot of rum). This action ruffled the feathers of their lordships at the Admiralty who considered that, apart from the monarch, only naval commanders-in-chief and the sea lords could give this beneficent order.<br>
<br>In 1948 &#145;Egg&#146; Irving, as he was now widely called because of his initials, carried out in HMS <i>Sharpshooter</i> a number of sea trials of the newly developed two-range Decca system for fixing the position of surveying ships when they were out of sight of land. This electronic invention brought about a radical change in sea surveying. Irving, by then a rear-admiral, was in 1960 appointed hydrographer of the Royal Navy, a post he held with distinction. During this period he convinced the Admiralty that converted warships made poor surveying vessels, and that new survey ships, custom-built to meet an increased oceanographic role&#151;and to merchant ship rather than naval specifications&#151;would save money by reducing the manpower needed to operate them. In December 1964 Irving's wife launched <i>Hecla</i>, the first of four successful ocean-going survey ships. He was appointed CB in 1962 and KBE in 1966, the year of his retirement. Meanwhile, in September 1966, Irving and his staff went to Leningrad in the survey ship HMS <i>Vidal</i> to confer with Admiral Rassokho, the Soviet hydrographer. It was eleven years since any British naval ship had visited the Soviet Union but, having been warned in advance of the quantity of vodka they would be expected to imbibe in the name of friendship, the British visitors established cordial relations and charts were exchanged to mutual benefit.<br>
<br>Irving was a man of great energy and enthusiasm with a flair for remembering people's names. When he took command of a ship he very quickly got to know the names of all his men. He was associated with a great number of institutes and associations, always playing an active part and often chairing vital committees, so that his retirement years were full and busy. He continued for a number of years to work for the Decca company, promoting the use of their electronic surveying equipment worldwide. He served on the council of the Royal Geographical Society, chairing the expeditions committee from 1965 to 1975, and as the society's president (1969&#150;71). In 1976 he was awarded the society's patron's medal for &#145;services to the advancement of hydrographic science and encouragement for exploration&#146;. As a member of the committee of management of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1960, he was chairman of the boat committee from 1969 to 1978, when the faster <i>Waveney</i> and <i>Arun</i> class lifeboats were being developed. He was a fellow of the Royal Institution of Navigation and its president from 1967 to 1969. He also served in the Natural Environment Research Council from 1967 to 1974, and was acting conservator of the River Mersey from 1975 to 1985. He was a trustee of the National Maritime Museum (1972&#150;81) and an active member of the Society for Nautical Research.<br>
<br>Of middle height and fairly stout, Irving had a light complexion and sandy hair (although his beard was red when he grew it in wartime), with vivid blue eyes and bushy eyebrows. His first wife died in 1974 and in 1979 he married Esther Rebecca, daughter of Joseph Ellison, a company director. He died of a heart attack at his home, Camer Green, Meopham, Kent, on 1 October 1990.<br>
