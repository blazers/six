<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (1781&#150;1859), <span class="occ">chemist and inventor of a friction match</span>, was born at 104 High Street, Stockton-on-Tees, on 29 May 1781, the third son of John Walker (1748&#150;1812), a grocer, and wine and spirits merchant, and his wife, Mary Peacock (1752&#150;1840). He was educated in the town and afterwards apprenticed to Watson Alcock, Stockton's principal surgeon. He then moved to London&#151;probably to complete his medical training&#151;before returning to Stockton as assistant surgeon to Alcock. However, he came to dislike this work, and, as he was interested in botany and chemistry, he moved first to Durham and then to York, where he was employed by wholesale druggists. He then returned to Stockton and in June 1819 opened a chemist and druggist's shop at 59 High Street, where he made up prescriptions and supplied medicines for animals.<br>
<br>Walker also enjoyed experimenting with chemicals. One day, at home, he prepared a mixture in which a dipped splint, probably used as a stirrer, became coated and dried. When the splint was scraped on the hearth, either accidentally or in an effort to remove the coating, it suddenly sparked and caught fire. Realizing that he had found a simple method of making an instant sustainable flame or light, he decided to prepare further splints that he could sell or give away. His only surviving daybook contains the earliest recorded sale of these friction matches (first entered as &#145;Sulphurata Hyperoxygenata Frict.&#146;) to a local solicitor on 7 April 1827. As it appears that this was the thirtieth batch to have been produced, it seems likely that he made his important discovery some time in 1826.<br>
<br>In September 1827 Walker started calling the new matches &#145;friction lights&#146;, which became his usual name for them. The cost of 100 of these was 1<i>s</i>., with a round tin case for 2<i>d</i>., though the matches were often sold loose. A piece of folded glasspaper was supplied with each box, and the matches, at first made of pasteboard (later wood), were flat and about 3 inches long. A match was lit by pinching the head between the folds of glasspaper and then quickly withdrawing it&#151;the friction igniting the chemical tip. The composition of this tip was antimony sulphide and potassium chlorate mixed with gum arabic, starch, and water.<br>
<br>Walker did not think his invention was worth patenting, considering it trivial and preferring to leave its full commercial potential to others. As a result, Samuel Jones of London introduced an imitation of the friction light in 1829, which he called the Lucifer, a name that Walker disliked. Lucifers quickly became established and Walker ceased making his own matches, probably about 1830 or 1831, though he continued with his original trade until he retired. However, his invention should not be underestimated, as it was the first really practical match and an improvement on earlier methods of making fire, which could sometimes be dangerous. Friction matches gradually replaced the cumbersome tinderbox, and although expensive at the time, they eventually developed into the modern, mass-produced safety match, which could be bought very cheaply.<br>
<br>Walker was small and thin in appearance, and had a courteous but cheerful nature. Clever and knowledgeable, he was always willing to give advice. His dress was neat, usually consisting of a brown coat with tails, drab knee-breeches, and grey stockings. He never married. In retirement he lived at 1b The Square in Stockton, where, suffering from heart disease and dropsy, he died on 1 May 1859. He was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, on 5 May 1859.<br>
