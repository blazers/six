<span class="headword">Hill,  Leonard  Raven-</span>  (1867&#150;1942), <span class="occ">illustrator and cartoonist</span>, was born at 18 New Bond Street, Bath, Somerset, on 10 March 1867, the son of William Hill, a master umbrella maker, and his wife, Anne Scott. He was educated as a day boy at the old Bristol grammar school and afterwards went to the Devon county school. He proceeded to study at the Lambeth School of Art, working side by side with C. Ricketts and C. Shannon, and later at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian under W.-A. Bouguereau and with Aim&eacute; Morot (1885&#150;7) in Paris. He exhibited paintings at the Salon, the Royal Academy, the New English Art Club, and the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, but his own inclination led him towards pen-and-ink work. Raven-Hill served as a volunteer with the 2nd Wiltshire voluntary battalion which provided plenty of pictorial copy and which accounts for some of the insights in his drawing during the war.<br>
<br>Raven-Hill became a regular contributor of joke cartoons, theatrical caricatures, and illustrations to a variety of publications including <span class="italic">Black &amp; White</span>, <span class="italic">The Idler</span>, the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Windsor Magazine</span>&#151;his career coincided with new methods of mechanical reproduction and the proliferation of &#145;light papers&#146;. In 1890 he was appointed the art editor of <span class="italic">Pick-Me-Up</span> and was largely responsible for its success, and became a founder joint editor of the <span class="italic">Butterfly</span> (1893) which ranked high among the artistic periodicals. He was a celebrated draughtsman when his first drawing in <span class="italic">Punch</span> appeared on 28 December 1895. In 1889 Raven-Hill married Annie (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Mark Rogers, a woodcarver. Following her death, he married in 1923 Marion Jean Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1940), for a number of years the able advertisement editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>.<br>
<br>Raven-Hill joined the <span class="italic">Punch</span> staff and table, which he duly initialled, in 1901 on the same evening that Sir John Tenniel appeared at it for the last time, and he became a political cartoonist on the death of E. Linley Sambourne in 1910. He was second cartoonist (1910&#150;35) to Sir Bernard Partridge, producing some notable work at a time when <span class="italic">Punch</span> was a national institution. He excelled in vitality and energy of line, and was never so pleased as when called upon to represent a scene of violent action at the shortest possible notice. If, as sometimes happened, his design for a <span class="italic">Punch</span> cartoon proved unsatisfactory, he was willing, and even pleased, to draw an entirely different one on the same morning. He considered the political cartoon more serious, requiring careful thought, classical treatment, and considerable pains in draughtsmanship. Among the favourite subjects of his social cartoons were East End Jews, London street scenes, bridge players, deer-stalking, and motor-car incidents. He illustrated several books including <span class="italic">Stalky and Co.</span> for Kipling, and <span class="italic">Kipps</span> for H. G. Wells, to the complete satisfaction of both authors. His own publications include <span class="italic">The Promenaders</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Our Battalion</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">An Indian Sketch-Book</span> (1904). He was convivial, irascible, and often inarticulate in speech as he was eloquent with his pen. Failing eyesight and his health generally forced his retirement. Raven-Hill's earlier social cartoons, influenced by Charles Keene, evince an original sense of humour and strong powers of characterization but his reputation is inextricably linked to his long association with <span class="italic">Punch</span>. He died at Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 31 March 1942. Examples of his drawings are in the <span class="italic">Punch</span> archive and library, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and Birmingham City Art Gallery.<br>
