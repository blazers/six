<span class="headword">Sinclair <span class="st"> [St Clair]</span>,  James</span>  (1687/8&#150;1762), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Henry Sinclair or St Clair, tenth Lord Sinclair (<i>bap</i>. 1660, <i>d</i>. 1723), and Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1660), daughter of Sir James Cockburn, first baronet. James Sinclair's father was the only Scottish peer to object to the act settling the crown on William and Mary, and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25626/', "John Sinclair, master of Sinclair, styled eleventh Lord Sinclair (bap. 1683, d. 1750)")</script>, remained true to the Jacobite cause.<br>
<br>James (then a child of about six) was entered in the army in 1694 with an ensign's commission, dated 22 May 1694, in the Royal Scots regiment (1st foot). His active service began during Marlborough's campaigns in Flanders. He was promoted captain in the Royal Scots on 2 November 1708. After the treaty of Utrecht in 1713 he was placed on half pay. However, on 19 May 1714 he joined the 3rd regiment of guards (the Scots guards) with the rank of captain and lieutenant-colonel. In 1722 he was made a brevet colonel (a non-regimental rank) and second major in the Scots guards; he became first major in 1723. He was colonel of the 22nd foot (later the Cheshire regiment) between 1722 and 1734, and was made lieutenant-governor of Berwick and Holy Island in 1733.<br>
<br>Sinclair married Janet (1698&#150;1766), youngest daughter of Sir David Dalrymple of Hailes, first baronet, and widow of Sir John Baird of Newbyth, second baronet. In 1735 he purchased the estates of Roslin Castle, Ravenscraig, and Dysart, which he entailed on the male heirs of his sisters, he and his wife having had no children. In 1723 he had inherited the family estates on the death of his father; however, when his brother obtained an act allowing him to inherit property, Sinclair conveyed the estate to him. On 26 June 1737 Sinclair transferred to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the Royal Scots, which he held until his death. On 2 July 1739 he was promoted brigadier-general; he was named major-general on 15 August 1741 and lieutenant-general and quartermaster-general of the British forces in Flanders on 4 June 1745.<br>
<br>In 1746 he was appointed to command an expedition against Quebec, but the fleet's having been delayed in the channel too long to permit its sailing that season it was decided to mount a diversionary attack on the coast of Brittany. Port Lorient, where the French East India Company had its depot of stores and ships, was chosen as the target. With reinforcements bringing the number of troops to 8000 men (many were, however, suffering from sickness due to the crowded conditions on the transports) and a detachment of artillery the expedition sailed from Portsmouth on 15 September 1746. A successful landing was made at Quimperle. Upon reaching Lorient, Sinclair rejected an offer of surrender on good terms from the French governor and a siege was begun. The French had been able to bring reinforcements into the town and the attempt to bring about a surrender by force of arms was soon abandoned. The expeditionary force was re-embarked for England on 17 October, having destroyed the forts in Quiberon Bay.<br>
<br>The comparative failure of the Lorient expedition has not been treated lightly by later historians. Fortescue wrote:<blockquote>Anything more pointless than the design or more contemptible than the execution of this project can hardly be conceived, for it simply employed regiments which were badly needed in Flanders and America in useless operations, which did not amount to a diversion (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 2.156)</blockquote>Among his contemporaries Sinclair's conduct was defended by a kinsman, the historian David Hume, who was employed as his secretary and held a commission as judge-advocate to the forces on the expedition. Regarding the expedition Hume stated that Sinclair, &#145;neither proposed it, nor planned it, nor approved it, nor answered for its success&#146;  (Hill Burton, 1.455). When Sinclair informed the authorities at Whitehall of his complete lack of knowledge of the French coast or the disposition of French forces he was answered that &#145;nothing was expected of him but to land where he pleased in France, to produce an alarm and to return safe&#146;  (ibid., 440). According to Hume, Sinclair's rejection of the French governor's terms for surrender was based upon the need to make a show of force together with poor advice from his artillery officers regarding the likelihood of a short and successful siege. In fact it soon proved the case that the town could not be invested from all sides, the French were able to bring in reinforcements of militia, and the French batteries proved too strong. Hume thus concluded: &#145;By his prudence in timely desisting from a fruitless enterprise the misfortune was confined merely to a disappointment without loss or dishonour to British arms&#146;  (ibid., 455).<br>
<br>Sinclair endured criticism, but his career did not suffer greatly from the Lorient expedition. In 1748 he was sent on a military mission to the courts of Vienna and Turin. His official purpose was to continue the work of his predecessor, Lieutenant-General Thomas Wentworth, in restoring Austro-Sardinian relations. His secret purpose was to discover whether the smaller allies in receipt of British subsidies were maintaining their quota of troops in the field. Once again David Hume was employed as his secretary and aide-de-camp and left a series of letters to his brother describing the lands through which they travelled.<br>
<br>In 1750 Sinclair's elder brother John died without leaving issue and the family estates once more passed into his possession; and but for the attainder of 1715 he would have become the twelfth Lord Sinclair. By now he was reputed to be a man of considerable wealth, garnered in the main from his collieries. Between 1756 and 1758 the Scottish architect George Paterson (<i>d</i>. 1789) designed a new building for Sinclair at Dysart House in Fife. Sinclair sat for many years in the House of Commons and, though the brother of a Jacobite, supported successive whig administrations as an ally of Archibald Campbell, earl of Ilay and later third duke of Argyll. From 1722 to 1734 he sat for the Dysart burghs and from 1736 to 1747 he represented Sutherland. He was defeated at Sutherland in 1747 following criticism of the Lorient expedition, but thereafter sat once again for Dysart burghs until 1754. From then until 1762 he represented Fife. He was the political patron of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8857/', "Sir Henry Erskine")</script>, whom he made heir to his unentailed estates.<br>
<br>William Pitt the elder pressed Sinclair's claims to succeed as commander-in-chief of the armed forces in 1760, which the duke of Newcastle rejected on grounds of age and deafness, as well as Sinclair's friendship with John Stuart, third earl of Bute, then in opposition. However, following the accession of Bute's pupil, George III, on 10 March 1761, he was promoted general. He died at Dysart House on 30 November 1762, aged seventy-four, being then governor of Cork and a major-general on the staff in Ireland. He was survived by his wife, Janet, who died at Greek Street, in Soho, on 8 January 1766. As the Sinclairs had no children, and the family's entailed estates passed to his nephew Colonel James Paterson Sinclair, the claim to the title of Lord Sinclair passed to a kinsman, Charles St Clair.<br>
