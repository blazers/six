<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Charles</span>, third earl of Harrington  (1753&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 March 1753, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26258/', "William Stanhope, second earl of Harrington (1719&#150;1779)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26257/', "Stanhope, William (1683?&#150;1756)")</script>], only son and namesake of the first earl of Harrington, and Lady Caroline Fitzroy (1722&#150;1784), daughter of the second duke of Grafton. Lord Petersham, as he was styled after the first earl's death, in 1756, was educated at Eton College from 1767 to 1769. Like his father and grandfather, he entered the army, becoming ensign in the Coldstream Guards in November 1769, and captain in the 29th foot in July 1773. In September 1774 he was briefly MP for Thetford, and from December 1776 he sat for Westminster, although he can rarely have been able to attend the Commons. Having embarked for North America in February 1776, he successfully landed his regiment's grenadier company, of which he had received the command in exchange for a light company, under fire at Quebec; and, serving under Major-General Guy Carleton, he saw action against the American colonists at Trois Rivi&egrave;res on 8 June 1776. As aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne, the commander of the British forces in the north, he fought in the disastrous Hudson valley campaign of 1777. Praised by Burgoyne for his excellent qualities and services, he was sent by him to England with dispatches announcing the surrender at Saratoga. There he obtained a captaincy in the 3rd foot guards and was allowed to purchase a higher commission. He defended his commanding officer on giving evidence to a Commons select committee of inquiry, on 1 June 1779, when, according to Horace Walpole, he &#145;did himself and Burgoyne honour&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 39.325). The following year, as lieutenant-colonel of the 85th foot, which he had raised at his own expense, he took part in the consolidation of the defences of Jamaica against a possible French invasion.<br>
<br>Petersham succeeded his libertine father as third earl of Harrington on 1 April 1779, and inherited the family estates at Elvaston Castle, Derbyshire, and the London residence of Harrington House, Craig's Court, Charing Cross. On 22 May that year he married Jane (1755&#150;1824), daughter of Sir John Fleming, first baronet, of Brompton Park, Middlesex, and Jane Coleman. She was lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte and a society hostess, and together they had eight sons and three daughters. Harrington took his seat in the House of Lords on 14 April 1779, but was inactive in politics, usually supporting the ministry of the day, as was expected of him as a courtier. Having returned in ill health from Jamaica, where his regiment was decimated by disease, Harrington was patronized by George III, who, on 26 November 1782, appointed him a colonel in the army and one of his aides-de-camp. Named colonel of the 65th foot in March 1783, he commanded the garrison at Dublin until 1785, when he was allowed to return home. In January 1788 he became colonel of his former infantry regiment, the 29th, and took up residence at Windsor. In March that year he declined a diplomatic posting in Russia because he would not have obtained the &#145;rank&#146; of ambassador  (BL, Add. MS 28063, fols. 122, 146). In December 1792 he received two appointments that he would hold for the rest of his life: the colonelcy of the first Life Guards; and the position of gold-stick-in-waiting. Prevented by this household employment from serving with the duke of York in Flanders, he was, however, promoted major-general in October 1793, and lieutenant-general in January 1798, and on 24 October 1798 he was sworn of the privy council. He was made second-in-command of the London staff in July 1803, and in October that year became a general. He undertook diplomatic missions to Berlin and Vienna in late 1805, and to Berlin again in early 1806. He was commander-in-chief in Ireland from October 1805 until his retirement in January 1812, and was sworn of the Irish privy council in August 1806.<br>
<br>Harrington saw out his days as governor of Windsor Castle, to which he was appointed in March 1812, and was awarded the grand cross of the Hanoverian order in 1816. A tory of unexceptionable character, Harrington, who received royal favour from George III and his successor, was a highly respected professional soldier. His adoption with the 65th foot of the system of tactics first devised by David Dundas, the Irish quartermaster-general, proved a great success and by the early 1790s it had been made general practice in the services. He made another significant contribution to the development of the forces by his introduction of a sword that, meeting with the approval of the duke of York, became the standard army sword in the early nineteenth century. He died at Brighton on 15 September 1829, and was buried at Elvaston on 27 September. He was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26243/', "Charles Stanhope, fourth earl of Harrington")</script>, who was himself succeeded by Stanhope's third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26250/', "Leicester Stanhope, fifth earl of Harrington")</script>.<br>
