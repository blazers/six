<span class="headword">Cockson <span class="st"> [Coxon]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1569, <em>d.</em> before 1641?), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the son of Ninian Cockson, was baptized on 3 April 1569 at Christ Church Greyfriars, London. He was apprenticed in the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to the celebrated William Rogers on 29 September 1584, and became a freeman of his father's livery company, the Merchant Taylors, on 21 February 1598.<br>
<br>Cockson's known work, comprising fewer than forty extant examples dated between 1591 and 1630, consists mainly of engraved portraits, the most impressive of which are equestrian studies of the earls of Cumberland, Essex, Nottingham, and Devonshire, dating from around 1600 and with cartographic backgrounds showing details of naval actions. Also of note are a 1596 chart of the operations at Cadiz, a satirical plate, <span class="italic">The Revells of Christendome</span> (1609), a large plate exhibiting the drill postures of musketeers and pikemen (1619), and a number of engraved title-pages. Cockson's work is justly characterized by Joseph Strutt as being executed &#145;entirely with the graver, in a neat, stiff style, which seem to prove, that he had much more industry than genius&#146;  (Strutt, 1.208). He was none the less an important figure in establishing a London-based school of engraving, and numbered both Robert Vaughan and Thomas Fullwood among his apprentices. His premises in Foster Lane were in the heart of the gold-working district, and it is likely that, as with other engravers at this early period, he had a parallel career in the decorative engraving of gold and silver plate. His name, which appears in several variant forms, was often appended to his prints in the form of a monogram of his initials, a device apt to cause confusion with Thomas Cecill and Thomas Cross. The record of a &#145;Widow Cockson&#146; on a poll-tax return of 1641 for the parish of St Sepulchre almost certainly indicates his death before that date.<br>
