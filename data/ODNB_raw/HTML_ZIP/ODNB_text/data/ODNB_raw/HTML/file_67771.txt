<span class="headword">Strachey,  Oliver</span>  (1874&#150;1960), <span class="occ">cryptanalyst</span>, was born on 3 November 1874 at Stowey House, Clapham Common, London, the third son among the thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36341/', "Sir Richard Strachey (1817&#150;1908)")</script>, public works secretary, India, and former lieutenant-general in the Royal Engineers, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52803/', "Jane Maria Strachey, n&#233;e Grant (1840&#150;1928)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36341/', "Strachey, Sir Richard")</script>], the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11274/', "John Peter Grant")</script>, the governor of Bengal. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36338/', "(Giles) Lytton Strachey")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52777/', "James Strachey")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61053/', "Ralph Strachey")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48467/', "(Joan) Pernel Strachey")</script>, the principal of Newnham College, Cambridge, from 1923 to 1941, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48519/', "Philippa Strachey")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64780/', "Dorothea Bussy")</script>.<br>
<br>Strachey was clever and good-looking, but also egotistic and somewhat feckless in his personal life. He was educated at Eton College (1889&#150;93), but did little &#145;except talk and play the piano&#146;  (Hamilton, 268). After studying music in Vienna for several years, he eventually found a post as a traffic superintendent with the East Indian Railway Company (of which his father was the chairman), but intensely disliked the work and life in India. He had wanted to be a concert pianist, and greatly missed artistic life in Britain. After his marriage to his first wife, Ruby Julia Mayer, was dissolved (there was one daughter, Julia), he returned to Britain and married Rachel Conn (Ray) Costelloe (1887&#150;1940) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38017/', "Strachey, Rachel")</script>], the feminist and stepdaughter of Bernhard Berenson, on 31 May 1911. They had two children, Barbara and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31727/', "Christopher Strachey")</script>.<br>
<br>To the dismay of his in-laws, Strachey preferred at first to live off Ray's money and theirs, instead of working. Charming and sociable, he enjoyed playing the piano at Bloomsbury parties. Despite his lack of educational success, he was well able to converse on philosophy with Bertrand Russell. According to his daughter Barbara Strachey, he was &#145;a very alarming arguer &hellip; because he would get up, throw his arms into the air and shriek with rage at you, and say &#147;but you're absolutely wrong&#148;&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Strachey shared his wife's suffrage concerns, and was on the executive committee of the (non-militant) National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (1915&#150;19). He also wrote <span class="italic">Keigwin's Rebellion</span> (1916) with Ray. Strachey did not take up work again until 1915, when he joined the War Office's code-breaking unit, MI1B, under Major Malcolm Hay. As one of MI1B's best code-breakers, he was sent to Egypt in mid-1916 for one year to establish a small code-breaking group there. He was fortunate to survive when his ship was sunk by a torpedo.<br>
<br>Strachey was one of the top three &#145;original key men&#146;  (Denniston, 54) recruited for the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS), with Ernst Fetterlein and Dillwyn Knox, when it was formed under Alastair Denniston in 1919, with a secret directive &#145;to study the methods of cypher communications used by foreign powers&#146;  (ibid., 49). Strachey was a senior assistant&#151;the equivalent of a principal in the administrative civil service. He worked mainly on American codes in the 1920s, and helped GCCS to achieve considerable success against diplomatic traffic in the inter-war years. Despite having very few staff (twenty-five cryptanalysts in 1919, and about fifty-five in 1937), GCCS could read &#145;all diplomatic communications of all powers&#146;  (ibid., 57) by 1939, except those which, like Germany and Russia, used unbreakable one-time pads. One of Strachey's rare failures occurred around 1938, when, along with other senior members of GCCS, he unsuccessfully attempted the extremely difficult task of reconstructing the wiring of Wehrmacht Enigma's rotors.<br>
<br>Strachey and Hugh Foss broke an early Japanese naval cipher machine (codenamed M-1 by the US navy) in September 1934. They were also almost certainly the code-breakers responsible for the GCCS solution a few months later of the &#145;Type A&#146; cipher machine (codenamed Red by the US army) used by Japanese naval attach&eacute;s and the Japanese foreign office.<br>
<br>Strachey is best-known for an important series of decrypts known as ISOS (Intelligence Services&#151;sometimes Section&#151;Oliver Strachey), consisting of Abwehr (the German armed forces' intelligence service) signals which had been encrypted using manual ciphers. However, the first Abwehr decrypts were not issued by GCCS until mid-April 1940, weeks after the Radio Security Service (RSS) had solved some Abwehr messages. Although the RSS knew from operators' chat that they were German messages, GCCS concluded that they were harmless Russian signals transmitted from Shanghai. In frustration, Hugh Trevor-Roper and E. W. B. Gill, in the RSS, solved the messages themselves, although the RSS was responsible only for intercepting illicit traffic. They proved that the traffic was Abwehr, and in doing so somewhat ruffled GCCS, which then took the task on board. Strachey was placed in charge of a new section, which eventually had to attack at least twenty different types of Abwehr hand ciphers. The ciphers were initially simple, often involving only columnar transposition (the &#145;shuffling&#146; of columns of text), but became increasingly complex as the war progressed: some were virtually intractable.<br>
<br>About 98,000 ISOS decrypts were distributed by GCCS under the supervision of Colonel Felix Cowgill in Section V (counter-espionage outside the United Kingdom) of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). ISOS became a crucial weapon against the Abwehr and other German intelligence services, especially when integrated with a related series, ISK (Intelligence Services (Dillwyn) Knox), decrypts of signals using a special Abwehr Enigma machine. Both series also played a vital role in ensuring the success of many strategic deception operations, such as Fortitude, which successfully disguised the target area of the Normandy D-day landings in June 1944.<br>
<br>Strachey was sent to Canada at the end of 1941, to head a small code-breaking section called &#145;the examination unit&#146; in the department of external affairs. Lacking experienced Canadian cryptanalysts, the department had na&iuml;vely appointed Herbert Yardley, the former head of the American cipher bureau, a joint war and state department code-breaking agency, to head the examination unit in mid-1941. However, Yardley was anathema to GCCS following his revelation of American code-breaking operations in his best-selling book <span class="italic">The American Black Chamber</span> (1931). Under intense pressure from GCCS, the Canadians sacked Yardley. In return they expected GCCS to supply a replacement, and to be treated as a partner by both GCCS and the American code-breakers, although the latter expectation was not fully realized. Since Yardley had been breaking Abwehr signals from South America, Strachey was the obvious choice to replace him, despite his age.<br>
<br>As well as working on Abwehr signals in Canada, Strachey also solved some Vichy French traffic there, and trained members of the examination unit. He returned to GCCS around September 1942, but not to be head of the ISOS section, since he was past retirement age. In December he successfully opposed a somewhat arrogant&#151;and unwise&#151;British proposal to dissolve the examination unit. Strachey was appointed CBE in 1943.<br>
<br>Despite being married Strachey had a number of relationships with other women. However, according to his daughter Barbara, he had &#145;a rather sad later life&#146; after Ray's death in 1940. He had a heart attack in 1943, after which he moved into a house in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, with his sisters Philippa and Pernel. His final years were spent in a nursing home. Strachey died on 14 May 1960 at 28 Kenilworth Road, Ealing, London.<br>
