<span class="headword">Pugh,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">miniature painter and topographer</span>, was baptized in June 1763 at Ruthin in Denbighshire, the son of David and Dorothy Pugh. His father was a barber and presumably, therefore, of moderate means, and nothing is known of how his son acquired a training in art. By 1793 Pugh was exhibiting miniatures at the Royal Academy where he continued to show both portraits and landscapes until 1808. He lived in London, although he spent a considerable amount of time in Wales, and was in Chester in 1799. He cut a minor figure in the London art world, possessed, as he himself conceded, only of a &#145;moderate talent&#146;  (Pugh, vii), but, nevertheless, provided drawings for <span class="italic">Modern London</span> (1804), and was known to individuals of note including the magistrate, amateur painter, and Sir Richard Phillips's caricaturist Henry Wigstead, by whom he is credited with drawing for his <span class="italic">Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales</span> (1800). Pugh's miniature practice drew on both Welsh and English patronage, notably among the literati in Chester and London, where he painted William Owen Pughe (<i>c</i>.1802). In its engraved form his miniature of the playwright Thomas Edwards, <span class="italic">Twm o'r Nant</span> (1799), became his most celebrated portrait.<br>
<br>It was Pugh's association with John Boydell, the publisher of prints, which led him in 1804 to commence his most important work, <span class="italic">Cambria depicta</span>. Over the next nine years Pugh travelled extensively on foot through north Wales, and both wrote the substantial text and provided the original drawings for seventy-two aquatints. Although the biographical details of Pugh's life are sketchy, a great deal can be said of his character, since <span class="italic">Cambria depicta</span> was written in the first person and in a lively and entertaining style. It presents Wales from the perspective of a native Welsh-speaker, rather than of an English traveller, on which grounds the author particularly commended the work to his audience for the insights it offered. Pugh regaled his readers with interesting incidents, gossip, and his idiosyncratic opinions on aesthetics and the general state of the world. Although working broadly within the eighteenth-century tradition of topographical and antiquarian descriptive writing, his was a fresh and democratic voice, expressing ambitions for the improvement of contemporary Welsh culture, as well as relating its history and myths. For instance, he proposed the establishment of a national academy on the Scottish model. Pugh died, apparently unmarried, in his home town of Ruthin where he was buried (at Well Street) on 20 July 1813, and did not see his masterpiece in printed form; it was published by Evan Williams in London three years later. Examples of his work are in the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
