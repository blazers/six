<span class="headword">Shoberl <span class="st"> [Schoberl]</span>,  Frederic</span>  (1775&#150;1853), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born in London on 10 April 1775, the son of Frederick Schoeberl and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill, and was baptized at St Katherine Coleman in the City of London on 30 April 1775. He was of German descent, and educated at the Moravian school at Fulneck, near Leeds. He settled in London, where he married at St James, Clerkenwell, on 24 July 1799, Seedo (Theodosia), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vaughan, with whom he had two sons, William and Frederic. Shoberl became, with Henry Colburn, the originator and co-proprietor of the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, which began in February 1814. For some time he acted as its editor, and contributed original articles and reviews. He was long associated with Rudolph Ackermann, whose <span class="italic">Repository of Arts</span> he edited from March 1809 to December 1828. He conducted Ackermann's English annual, <span class="italic">The Forget-me-Not</span>, from 1822 until 1834, and also edited the <span class="italic">Juvenile Forget-me-Not</span> from 1828 to 1832. In addition to his work for Ackermann, Shoberl was printer and publisher of the <span class="italic">Cornwall Gazette, Falmouth Packet, and Plymouth Journal</span> (1818&#150;19), a Conservative paper issued at Truro.<br>
<br>As well as his journalistic writing, Shoberl produced numerous other works reflecting his varied interests. In 1814 he published <span class="italic">A History of the University of Oxford</span>, followed by <span class="italic">A History of the University of Cambridge</span> in 1815 and <span class="italic">An Historical Account of the House of Saxony</span> in 1816. He had already published a variety of travel literature: <span class="italic">Travellers in Switzerland</span> (1803), <span class="italic">Travels in Greece, Palestine, Egypt and Barbary</span> (translated from a French original, 1812), and <span class="italic">Travels in Caucasus and Georgia</span> (translated from a German original, 1814). Later he became involved in producing a large number of translations from, among others, Klopstock, Kotzebue, Alfred de Vigny, Thiers, and Chateaubriand. He was also involved in the continuation, with J. Nightingale and others, of Brayley and Britton's <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span>, having compiled volume 14 containing Suffolk, Surrey, and Sussex in 1813. With J. Watkins he compiled <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of Living Authors</span> (1816).<br>
<br>Shoberl died at Thistle Grove, Brompton, London, on 5 March 1853, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 12 March. His wife had predeceased him on 18 December 1838, as had his younger son, Frederic, who had been printer to Prince Albert at 51 Rupert Street and had died on 22 March 1852, aged forty-eight. Shoberl was survived by his elder son, William Shoberl (1801&#150;1863), who was first an assistant to the publisher H. Colburn, and then a publisher in his own right at 20 Great Marlborough Street, London.<br>
