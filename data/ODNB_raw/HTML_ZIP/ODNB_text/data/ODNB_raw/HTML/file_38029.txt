<span class="headword">Stumpe,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1497&#150;1552), <span class="occ">clothier</span>, of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, was probably the son of a weaver of North Nibley, Gloucestershire. From obscure origins he rose to be the best-known Wiltshire clothier of his day, famous in the 1540s for his use of the buildings of Malmesbury Abbey as industrial workshops. Well before the dissolution of the monasteries Stumpe had settled in Malmesbury; by 1524 he was one of the town's richest inhabitants. He was elected MP for Malmesbury in 1529, and again in 1547, and may well have served in intervening parliaments for which the names of the members for Malmesbury are unknown.<br>
<br>In 1536, when the court of augmentations was established to deal with the lands acquired by the crown through the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, Stumpe was appointed a receiver for north Wales, with a generous travelling allowance besides his salary of &pound;20 p.a. In 1538 he was named a justice of the peace for Wiltshire, an appointment he retained until his death, and in March 1539, during an invasion scare, he helped to muster able men in Malmesbury and elsewhere in the county. On the surrender of the abbey to the king's commissioners in December 1539, the buildings assigned &#145;to remain undefaced&#146; were given into the custody of its former steward, Sir Edward Baynton, but all those &#145;deemed to be superfluous&#146; were committed to Stumpe as Baynton's deputy: they included the church, cloister, chapter house, dormitory, frater, and infirmary. Stumpe was instrumental in saving the nave of the church for use by the townspeople as their parish church. In 1541 Thomas Cranmer issued a licence for the conversion, which ensured the survival of at least part of the great abbey.<br>
<br>Indirectly, the town probably also gained from Stumpe's decision to install broad looms in other parts of the abbey buildings. John Leland, visiting Malmesbury in the early 1540s, reported that 3000 cloths were being made there every year. (The city of Oxford in 1546 negotiated with Stumpe for a similar use of Osney Abbey, hoping to provide work for 2000 people, but nothing came of this project.) Finally, in 1544 Stumpe consolidated his interest in the property by paying over &pound;1500 for a royal grant to himself and his heirs of the whole site of the abbey. By the end of the decade he was living in a new house built within the precinct.<br>
<br>Stumpe was married three times. His first wife was Joyce, daughter of James Berkeley of Bradley, Gloucestershire; there were two sons of the marriage, the elder born in 1519. He married secondly, in or after 1533, Tibbilda, widow of William Billing, and thirdly, in 1551, Katherine (or Catherine), widow of Richard Mody, who survived him with the infant son of the marriage. Stumpe was named sheriff of Wiltshire in November 1551, but died on 22 July 1552, during his term of office. His second son succeeded him as a clothier, his eldest son, Sir James, having already moved into the ranks of the landed gentry.<br>
