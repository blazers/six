<span class="headword">Meeke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Allen]</span>,  Elizabeth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gabrielli]</span>  (1761&#150;1826?), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 13 November 1761 in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and baptized on the same day at St Margaret's Church in the town. She was the youngest of three children of Stephen Allen (1724&#150;1763), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Allen (1728&#150;1796); her parents were cousins. Following her father's death, in 1767 her mother married second the musician and author, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4078/', "Charles Burney")</script>. The Allen children thereby gained several step-siblings, including the future novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/603/', "Frances Burney")</script>. In December 1775 Elizabeth was sent to Paris to complete her education, initially under the care of Isabella Strange, a family friend, and subsequently as a boarder with a Mlle Picot. Her mother travelled out to meet her in August 1777, intending to bring her home: but Elizabeth Allen then absconded from Paris with Samuel Meeke (<i>c</i>.1737&#150;1802), and their marriage followed on 12 October 1777 at Ypres. Scandalized contemporaries described Meeke as &#145;Bankrupt in Fame as well as Fortune&#146; and &#145;an adventurer&#146; (Sclater, 31; <span class="italic">Burford Papers</span>, 60).<br>
<br>The Meekes are next recorded living in Geneva in 1781, before moving to France in the following year. Thereafter, Elizabeth Meeke occasionally visited her relations in Britain, and there was some question of a potential separation from her husband: in an undated letter to Frances Burney she declared that &#145;Meeke &amp; I are likely to [join] together again for better for worse&#146;, and asked her &#145;to hint this to my Mother &amp; to beg she would not indulge her talents for embellishing at my expense&#146;  (MS letter, NYPL, Berg Collection). By 1786 Samuel Meeke was employed in Paris as an English tutor under the supervision of Mme de Genlis, and counted the duc de Chartres, son of the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, among his pupils; Elizabeth Meeke presumably encountered this milieu to some extent. In 1787, however, the Meekes arranged a legal separation: this estrangement, according to gossip in the extended Burney family, had involved Elizabeth leaving her husband for another man. Thereafter, she apparently continued to live on the continent, surprising her relatives by reappearing in Britain in 1793, some months after the outbreak of war with revolutionary France.<br>
<br>The first &#145;Mrs Meeke&#146; novel was published in 1795 by William Lane's Minerva Press, and a total of twenty-six novels appeared between then and 1823; these included five works published anonymously and six written under the pseudonym Gabrielli, but which are all traceable to Mrs Meeke through cross-references on title-pages and advertisements. This output made Mrs Meeke the most prolific novelist of the period, outmatching even Sir Walter Scott  (Raven, 1.39, 2.64). None of the novels gave a first name for Mrs Meeke. However, a Minerva Press prospectus produced in 1798 gave the author's name as Elizabeth Meeke (<span class="italic">Minerva Literary Repository</span>). Meanwhile, the first two Mrs Meeke novels received unsigned puffs in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> which are known to have been written by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4079/', "Charles Burney")</script>, Elizabeth Meeke's stepbrother; and the first Gabrielli novel was dedicated to Mrs Arthur Young, who can be identified as Martha Young, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen, wife of the agriculturalist and writer Arthur Young, and the maternal aunt of Elizabeth Meeke. This evidence allows Elizabeth Meeke to be identified conclusively as the author Mrs Meeke. Unfortunately, none of this information was known at the time of compilation of the Victorian <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and its new edition (2004), where &#145;Mrs Meeke&#146; was misidentified as Mary Meeke (1744/5?&#150;1816), wife of the Revd Francis Meeke, a Staffordshire clergyman and occasional poet. This error was subsequently reproduced in standard accounts, until corrected in 2013  (Macdonald).<br>
<br>Meeke's first novel, <span class="italic">Count St Blancard, or, The Prejudiced Judge</span> (1795), set the pattern for much of her subsequent output. The action unfolds largely in pre-revolutionary France and hinges around the oppressive family history of the young St Blancard, who has been lost to his parents as a baby&#151;through the malevolence of his grandfather&#151;and brought up unawares by kindly strangers. As the plot develops, these mysteries are gradually unravelled, culminating in the revelation of St Blancard's true identity, which enables him to marry his high-born paramour. This broadly Gothic formula was one which would serve Meeke well, and she quickly became a leading author for the Minerva Press. Notable readers included the young Thomas Babington Macaulay. As his sister Hannah Macaulay later recalled,<blockquote>There was a certain prolific author named Mrs. Meeke, whose romances he all but knew by heart; though he quite agreed in my criticism that they were one just like another, turning on the fortunes of some young man of a very low rank who eventually proves to be the son of a Duke. (Trevelyan, 1.132)</blockquote>Macaulay himself described this &#145;fondness for Mrs Meeke's novels&#146; as evidence that his tastes were &#145;incurably vulgar&#146;  (Pinney, 2.216), indicating the extent to which Meeke's works were associated with a popular readership.<br>
<br>The other Mrs Meeke novels were <span class="italic">The Abbey of Clugny</span> (1796), <span class="italic">Palmira and Ermance</span> (1797), <span class="italic">Ellesmere</span> (1799), <span class="italic">Which is the Man?</span> (1801), <span class="italic">Midnight Weddings</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Amazement</span> (1804), <span class="italic">The Nine Days' Wonder</span> (1804), <span class="italic">The Old Wife and Young Husband</span> (1804), <span class="italic">&#145;There is a Secret, Find it Out!&#146;</span> (1808), <span class="italic">Matrimony, the Height of Bliss, or, The Extreme of Misery</span> (1812), <span class="italic">Conscience</span> (1814), <span class="italic">The Spanish Campaign, or, The Jew</span> (1815), <span class="italic">The Veiled Protectress, or, The Mysterious Mother</span> (1819), and <span class="italic">What Shall Be, Shall Be</span> (1823). Her five anonymously published titles were <span class="italic">The Wonder of the Village</span> (1805), <span class="italic">Anecdotes of the Altamont Family</span> (1800), <span class="italic">The Sicilian</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Harcourt</span> (1799), and <span class="italic">Something Odd!</span> (1804). The six Gabrielli novels were <span class="italic">The Mysterious Wife</span> (1797), <span class="italic">The Mysterious Husband</span> (1801), <span class="italic">Independence</span> (1802), <span class="italic">Something Strange</span> (1806), <span class="italic">Langhton Priory</span> (1809), and <span class="italic">Stratagems Defeated</span> (1811).<br>
<br>Four novels translated by Meeke were also published, all based on French-language sources: <span class="italic">A Tale of Mystery, or, Celina</span> (1803, from Fran&ccedil;ois-Guillaume Ducray-Dumenil), <span class="italic">Lobenstein Village</span> (1804, based on a French translation of an original German novel by August Lafontaine), <span class="italic">Julien, or, My Father's House</span> (1807, also from Ducray-Dumenil), and <span class="italic">Elizabeth, or, The Exiles of Siberia</span> (1807, from Sophie Ristaud Cottin). Meeke later produced a non-fiction French translation, <span class="italic">The Unpublished Correspondence of Madame Du Deffand</span> (1810). She also had some ability in German, completing Mary Collyer's 1763 translation of Friedrich Klopstock's <span class="italic">Messiah</span> (1811). Meeke also authored three children's books, all undated: <span class="italic">The Birth-Day Present</span> (in circulation by 1825), <span class="italic">Mamma's Gift</span>, and <span class="italic">The Parent's Offering to a Good Child</span>.<br>
<br>In taking up the pen Elizabeth Meeke joined an auspicious family tradition, represented above all by her stepsister Frances Burney. Yet their respective outputs could hardly have been more contrasting: if Burney was the most prestigious novelist of the period, Meeke would become the most prolific, and her motivation for writing was unashamedly commercial. Her literary career began following a series of personal upheavals which had undermined her social and financial position. Nevertheless, her personal history as an expatriate in France and on the wider continent evidently informed her fiction writing and facilitated her translation work. Little is known about her life during the period when she was writing. About 1796, and for an indeterminate period thereafter, she posed socially as Mrs Bruce. However, she does not seem to have remarried until long after Samuel Meeke's death in 1802. Legal documents dating from July 1824 record her impending marriage to a Benjamin Rawlings, and this appears to have taken place by November of that year. Details of the date and place of her death are unknown. However, her death is noted in an undated letter from Cornelia Cambridge, a social connection of the Burneys (BL, Egerton MS, 3705 fol. 65), which may have been written in October 1826.<br>
