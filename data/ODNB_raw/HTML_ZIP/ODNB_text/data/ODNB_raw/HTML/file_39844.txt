<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Streatfeild,  (Mary) Noel</span>  (1895&#150;1986), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 24 December 1895 in Frant, Sussex, the second child and second daughter in the family of five daughters (the second youngest of whom died at the age of two) and one son of William Champion Streatfeild (1865&#150;1929), an Anglican vicar, and his wife, Janet Mary, daughter of Henry Venn, vicar of Walmer. She grew up in Amberley, St Leonards, and Eastbourne, where her father was vicar (he later became suffragan bishop of Lewes). In the first part of her autobiography she describes overhearing her mother's friends identify her as &#145;the plain one&#146;. That, and the genteel poverty in which they lived, made her fiercely resentful and in later years it was noticeable what an important part clothes played in her plots and her own life; she was always elegant. She was educated at the Hastings and St Leonard's Ladies' College in St Leonards and Laleham School in Eastbourne. In 1916 she went to work in Woolwich arsenal, but became ill. In 1919 she joined the (Royal) Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She had moderate success as an <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> playing in repertory, reviews, and pantomime. She also went on tour in South Africa, Rhodesia, New Zealand, and Australia. When her father died in 1929 she returned home and decided to adopt a more stable career, choosing to be a writer.<br>
<br>Noel Streatfeild's first efforts were three fairy stories published in a children's magazine and a novel, <span class="italic">The Whicharts</span> (1931), based on children's misunderstanding of the prayer &#145;Our Father which art &hellip;&#146;. Its success encouraged her to write five other novels, including <span class="italic">I Ordered a Table for Six</span> (1942), which anticipated the bomb which destroyed the Caf&eacute; Royal a year later. It was about this time, after her agent suggested she try writing for children, that she rather unenthusiastically produced <span class="italic">Ballet Shoes</span> (1936), which became a runaway success, and which caused her to have no further worries about money.<br>
<br>Almost by accident Noel Streatfeild had found the perfect ingredients for a children's book. Into it she had put all her accumulated backstage knowledge of the theatre and of her sister's ballet training, as well as their childhood struggles with hardship and a genuine picture of family life. <span class="italic">Tennis Shoes</span> (1937) incorporated the advice given to her by John Galsworthy, in the first fan letter she received, &#145;always remember to know at least three times as much as you are going to put on paper&#146;. Her third book, <span class="italic">The Circus is Coming</span> (1938), was the result of nearly a year spent travelling with a family circus and won her the Library Association's Carnegie medal.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Noel Streatfeild trained as an air raid warden and joined the Women's Voluntary Service, running a canteen service in London for people in the Deptford shelters. In her spare time, she prettified London by scattering flower seeds on bomb sites. In 1941 her London flat was bombed and she lost almost everything. She nevertheless wrote four more children's books during the war, including <span class="italic">Party Frock</span> (1946). After the war she spent some time in Hollywood, from which came <span class="italic">The Painted Garden</span> (1949). In 1951 <span class="italic">White Boots</span>, a story about skating, appeared. She began to share a flat at 51A Elizabeth Street, London, with a friend, Margot Grey.<br>
<br>Noel Streatfeild believed that every detail in her books should be factually correct and she also developed her characters convincingly. Her writing for young readers had a reassuring warmth, or &#145;heart&#146; as she described it, and almost all her stories were centred on families. The family background and rules of behaviour between parents and siblings had a warm quality which made them both fascinating and believable.<br>
<br>In all Noel Streatfeild wrote sixty-four books, all but seventeen for children, always drawing on her own experience to make them as authentic as possible. Many of them were broadcast on radio or television; it was the BBC which introduced her Bell family to radio; the serials were broadcast from 1949 to 1953. <span class="italic">The Growing Summer</span> (1966) was a television serial set in Ireland, and <span class="italic">Thursday's Child</span> (1970) was also serialized. She wrote her autobiography in three volumes, and a life of another renowned writer of children's books, Edith Nesbit (<span class="italic">Magic and the Magician</span>, 1958). She was generous in encouraging young writers and replied kindly to every child who wrote to her. She was also indefatigable in her response to schools and libraries, never treating this as a duty, but taking the trouble to make her visits as exciting and glamorous as possible. On the days when she visited the yearly exhibition of the Puffin Club (the children's branch of Penguin Books, which published her work), huge queues formed to get her autograph. Mothers came with their daughters, bringing their own battered copies of <span class="italic">Ballet Shoes</span> to be signed. She was appointed OBE in 1983.<br>
<br>Noel Streatfeild was a tall woman, with a fine carriage. She often wore a mink coat, and her lovely hands were regularly manicured with rich red nail polish. She was physically somewhat clumsy, with a rather loud, commanding voice. She never married. She died on 11 September 1986 in a nursing home, Vicarage Gate House, Vicarage Gate, London, after a stroke. Her funeral was held at St Michael's Church, Chester Square, London, on 22 September 1986.<br>
