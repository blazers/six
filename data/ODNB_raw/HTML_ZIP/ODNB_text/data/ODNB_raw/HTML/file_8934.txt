<span class="headword">Eusden,  Laurence</span>  (1688&#150;1730), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 6 September 1688, at Spofforth, Yorkshire, where his father, Laurence Eusden (<i>d</i>. 1699), was rector. He went to St Peter's School, York, and was admitted as pensioner (aged sixteen) at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 24 March 1705. He graduated BA in 1708, MA in 1712. On 2 April 1706 he became a scholar of his college, was admitted as a minor fellow on 2 October 1711, and advanced to a full fellowship on 2 July 1712. He became third sublector on 2 October 1712, and a year later was admitted as second sublector. He drew no stipend after 1720, but continued at least occasionally in residence until 1725.<br>
<br>Eusden, a whig, was not among the Trinity fellows hostile to the master, Richard Bentley; he wrote a congratulatory poem to Bentley on the refurbishment of the college chapel. He also wrote sensuous love poetry, including translations of Claudian and Musaeus, and a faintly risqu&eacute; satire of women, <span class="italic">Verses at the Last Publick Commencement in Cambridge</span> (1714). He was one of the largest contributors to a collection of English versions of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> by Dryden, Garth, and others (1717).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Eusden's verse compliments to Addison, Lord Halifax, and the duke of Newcastle brought him the patronage of highly placed whigs. Listed by Steele among <span class="italic">Spectator</span> and <span class="italic">Guardian</span> authors, Eusden was credited (by John Nichols) with letters in <span class="italic">Spectator</span> numbers 54, 78, and 87 (1711), and <span class="italic">Guardian</span> numbers 95 and 124 (1713). Eusden certainly contributed translations from Claudian in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (127 and 164) which were reprinted with ten other poems by him in Steele's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1714). He was one of seven poets granted the honour of having their commendatory verses on Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span> prefixed to the seventh edition of the play (1713). His lines &#145;To a Lady that Wept at Hearing Cato Read&#146; in Steele's <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> (1714) were promptly parodied by Pope as &#145;On a Lady who P&#151;St at the Tragedy of Cato&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1717 Eusden published a flattering epithalamium on the duke of Newcastle's marriage to Lady Henrietta Godolphin. His reward came when Nicholas Rowe died a year later and Newcastle, as lord chamberlain, made Eusden poet laureate. Over the next ten years he produced a steady drip of adulatory new year odes, birthday odes, and other conventional laureate verse addressed to members of the royal family, alongside complimentary verse addressed to actual or potential aristocratic patrons.<br>
<br>Eusden was ridiculed by the duke of Buckingham in &#145;The election of a poet laureate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1723); Thomas Cooke wrote of him in <span class="italic">The Battle of the Poets</span> (1725) as &#145;a laurel'd Bard &hellip; Who has by few been read, by fewer prais'd&#146;; and Swift satirized his laureate verse in &#145;Directions for a Birth-Day Song&#146; (1729, first printed 1765). Pope joined the attack in <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span>  (A. Pope and J. Swift, <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span>, 1728), <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1728), and <span class="italic">Dunciad variorum</span> (1729), and continued it, with further variations, in the <span class="italic">Epistle to Arbuthnot</span>, <span class="italic">Imitations of Horace: Ep.II.i</span>, and <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1743), well after his target's death. Pope accuses Eusden repeatedly and equally of dullness and drunkenness. The second charge is reiterated in Richard Savage's preface to his <span class="italic">An Author to be Lett</span> (1729), but it is not known whether the accusation is well grounded or is the common taunt that a poet craves the laureateship solely for the perquisite of sack. Thomas Gray's well-known punning remark in a letter to William Mason (19 December 1757) that &#145;Eusden was a person of great hopes in his youth, though at last he turned out a drunken parson&#146; might be based on Pope's satire, rather than independent testimony.<br>
<br>Eusden never replied to the many attacks upon his character and poetry. Whatever his character, his poetry has little merit. He was ordained deacon (Lincoln diocese) on 20 September 1724, and priest on 25 March 1729. He was chaplain to Richard Verney, Lord Willoughby de Broke, from 1725 to 1730, when he became rector of Coningsby, Lincolnshire, a living he obtained through the favour of a Mr Cotesworth. Eusden died at Coningsby on 27 September 1730, and was buried there three days later. He left behind him in manuscript a translation of the works of Tasso with a life of that poet. The sale catalogue of his library was dated 1763. His portrait, painted in the 1720s by Saunders (1682&#150;<i>c</i>.1735) of Cambridge, had not been traced.<br>
