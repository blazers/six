<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitch, Sir  Joshua Girling</span>  (1824&#150;1903), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Southwark, London, on 13 February 1824, the second son in a family of six sons and two daughters of Thomas Fitch (<i>b</i>. 1796), a clerk at Somerset House, and his wife, Sarah Tucker Hodges (<i>b</i>. 1794), both from Colchester. After attending a local school in Southwark he learned to teach in the model school of the Borough Road training college, under J. T. Crossley. This was followed by a brief period as master of a school in Kingsland Road, Dalston, before he joined the college staff in 1852. For some years an external student of London University, he graduated BA in classics in 1850 and MA in 1852. His outstanding teaching and administrative ability were recognized by rapid promotion to vice-principal and, in 1856, principal, on the retirement of James Cornwell, with whom he had collaborated on <span class="italic">The Science of Arithmetic</span> (1855; new edn, 1878), an innovative textbook. In 1856 Fitch married <a href="#cosubject_58587">Emma [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the daughter of Joseph Barber Wilks, treasurer of the East India Company, and sister of the physician Sir Samuel Wilks. Without a family of their own, they adopted Mary Pickton, a niece of Emma Fitch.<br>
<br>Fitch rigorously criticized Robert Lowe's revised code of 1861, but in such measured terms that it did not inhibit his appointment as her majesty's inspector in 1863, on Matthew Arnold's recommendation. From 1863 to 1870 his district was the West Riding of Yorkshire and, from 1877, Lambeth. In 1883 he became chief inspector for the eastern division, and from 1885 inspector of women's training colleges until his retirement in 1894, after a rare extension of five years. He was detached from normal duties from 1865 to 1867 and from 1870 to 1877, to act as an assistant commissioner for the schools inquiry commission (the Taunton commission) and the implementation of the subsequent legislation. This chronology gives no insight into Fitch's impact on the evolving education system in England. Michael Sadler judged that he &#145;rendered, during a time of rapid growth in governmental influence in English education, a service far greater than that accomplished by many men of greater ability, profounder learning and greater insight into the trend of English thought and affairs&#146;  (Sadler).<br>
<br>Fitch possessed an urbane and self-confident personality and the unusual ability to link technical mastery with vision. He was fortunate that his profound interest in teaching coincided with a national interest in pedagogical skills for the first time, and he tirelessly exploited opportunities provided by his office to make contacts with prominent people, publish extensively, and debate the educational issues of the day. His active liberalism, as well as a convivial disposition, led him to join the Savile Club and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95110', "Century Club")</script>, and in 1888 he was elected to the Athenaeum. As a broad churchman he found the ecumenical Churchmen's Union and the Christian Conference congenial. He had an impressive number of influential friends and acquaintances and as his reputation grew he was called to give evidence to royal commissions on technical and secondary education (1884), the working of the Elementary Education Acts (1888), and London University (1892), and to select committees on the <span class="roman">Endowed Schools Act</span> (1886), teacher registration (1892), and secondary education (1895). Attendance at meetings of educational bodies ranged from the Society of Arts to small, local, teachers' self-help associations. He was at various times an examiner for London University, the Indian Civil Service, Girton College, and a number of training colleges, as well as a governor of secondary schools, at that time influential roles.<br>
<br>Membership of the London Teachers' Association, of which he was president in 1858, attendance at the Social Science Association, articles for many educational and other journals, as well as acting as secretary to the education section of the 1862 International Exhibition, enhanced his reputation. As principal of the distinguished Borough Road College, Fitch influenced the future leaders of the profession and his addresses to students reveal a dimension which he greatly valued: the teacher as a cultured individual with many interests. As an inspector Fitch could affect classroom practice in a very direct way and his reports reveal critiques of classroom competence, which, while rigorous, were analytical and supportive, and treated teachers with a respect unusual in the harsh days of payment by results. This more complex understanding of their work contributed slowly to a new self-respect and professionalism among teachers which was strengthened by Fitch's natural courtesy and hatred of class distinction and pretentiousness in the profession, as is clear from a memorable address to the College of Preceptors in 1882, &#145;True and false ideals in education&#146;. This approach gained Fitch a fellowship from the Educational Institute of Scotland in 1894, the first English educationist to be honoured. He disliked unionization, however, and distrusted the National Union of Elementary Teachers, preferring the Teachers' Guild, of which he was a founder and president in 1895.<br>
<br>Fitch's first published work on teaching methods in the 1850s was for Sunday school teachers on matters connected with memory, securing attention, and questioning. In 1877 he taught a pioneering course on school management and method, notable for its range and depth, at the College of Preceptors. During the same period he attended meetings of the Education Society, formed in 1875, which shared his belief that teaching could be studied scientifically and would in due course be shown to rest upon a body of theory. In 1881 <span class="italic">Lectures on Teaching</span> was published, written with clarity and elegance, and destined to become one of the most significant books on teaching methods produced in the nineteenth century. The book grew out of lectures given to Cambridge University teacher training syndicate and continued in print until 1955. Influential in the United States and other parts of the world, it set the pattern for a new analytical style of pedagogical writing which replaced the earlier prescriptive manuals of method.<br>
<br>Fitch advocated links between elementary and secondary schools and was unique in his knowledge of both systems. He was also ahead of his time in championing the training of secondary school teachers, signalled by a prophetic article in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> of 1876, &#145;The universities and the training of teachers&#146;. As an assistant commissioner to reform the endowed grammar schools after the 1869 legislation he played a distinguished part in creating a publicly accountable, academically rigorous, and managerially competent secondary education system. In 1869 &#145;Educational endowments&#146;, in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, set out what the challenge was and &#145;Secondary education in England&#151;a retrospect and a prospect&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Educational Times</span> of 1891, evaluated what had been achieved.<br>
<br>Fitch's judgement, discretion, and detachment made him increasingly the trusted agent of senior politicians. In 1869 W. E. Forster selected him, with a colleague, to supply data on educational deprivation from four industrial cities, to support his interventionist policy preliminary to the 1870 <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span>. An article in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> for 1875, &#145;An economic experiment in the communal schools of Ghent&#146;, on school savings banks, demonstrated his conviction that future security rested on inculcating habits of thrift at a young age. Forster had already met Fitch on the Taunton commission and recognized the outstanding quality of his report on the Yorkshire endowed schools which, more than any other contribution, communicated to the public the decayed state of provision, and the need for decisive government action. While convinced that the transfer of funds from charitable uses to secondary education was beneficial, and sharing the government's collectivist attitude to the public oversight of education, Fitch resisted policies which he regarded as socialist. He only reluctantly came to accept free elementary education. He prepared a <span class="italic">Memorandum on the Working of the Free School System in America, France and Belgium</span> for the education department in 1891. Fitch came nearest to participating in policy-making at the highest level&#151;a rare experience for an inspector&#151;from 1880 to 1885, when A. J. Mundella was at the education department. Fitch was instrumental in introducing the controversial merit grant, modifying the restrictive curriculum of elementary schools, and gaining some sympathy for Froebelian approaches which were slowly permeating infant education.<br>
<br>Fitch provides an admirable example of an open-minded and progressive man with strong traditionalist roots seeking to realign himself to a changing society; a pace-setter in some radical initiatives, but reaching the limits of acceptance in others. Growing national interest in the social aspects of elementary education led to controversy with a senior neurologist, leading to an official report, the <span class="italic">Memorandum on Over-Pressure in Elementary Schools</span> (1884), in which Fitch revealed the limit of his tolerance for state intervention in education: &#145;To enforce, in regard to any human duty, a legal obligation, is to weaken in some degree the sense of moral obligation &hellip; the responsibility of caring for the food and health of young children belongs properly to the parent.&#146; The role of government in education was reviewed historically in a <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> article, &#145;Education and the state&#146;, in 1895, and the system as a whole was analysed in a magisterial article, the &#145;Education&#146; entry in the 10th edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. In two other areas Fitch represented one strand of national response to complex policy decisions, the local government of education and religion in school. He was a convinced exponent of <i>ad hoc</i>, directly elected, school boards and in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (1901) welcomed their initiative for &#145;The higher grade board schools&#146;. In his retirement he argued strongly through letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and elsewhere, against the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, intended to subsume education into general local government. Although a devout Anglican, Fitch was greatly influenced by his early experience with the undenominational British and Foreign School Society Borough Road College, and was a powerful apologist for the conscience clause and non-sectarian religious teaching. In his balanced and sensitive articles on religion at a time of intense sectarian divisions, he strengthened middle-ground opinion.<br>
<br>In 1903 Emily Davies wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to redress the omission from its obituary of Fitch of a sufficient acknowledgement of his importance to the cause of women's education. He had read a paper for Davies at an early Social Science Association conference; he was a founder member of the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women in 1866; and supported Frances Buss in attempts to get funds from the Charity Commission for girls' secondary education. He was involved in the foundation of the Girls' Public Day School Company in 1874, and was a member of the governing bodies of Girton College, Cambridge, Cheltenham Ladies' College, and St Paul's Girls' School. In 1890, with A. J. Mundella and Anna Swanwick, he was entrusted with the distribution of the Pfeiffer bequest of &pound;60,000 to support women's education. As inspector of women's training colleges he was able to ensure high standards and the introduction of good practice and began to free them from the narrow studies and monastic-like tradition which set them apart from mainstream teacher training. In addition to many professional links with the women's movement, he was part of a web of men and women (for example, the influential sisters Maria Grey and Emily Shirreff) which often arose from personal friendship and social interaction. Sometimes the link was through Emma Fitch's interests, as with the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92488', "Kensington Society")</script> and Octavia Hill's social work, but extending to support for the National Society for Women's Suffrage and the Hospital for Women. Through the involvement of his wife and adopted daughter in the Charity Organization Society, Fitch became an active member on his retirement, finding its work reflected his belief in co-ordinated and efficient, but not state promoted, social welfare. He became the chairman of its council in 1898.<br>
<br>From early in his career Fitch had been convinced of the desirability of adult education. He lectured to mechanics' institutes, working men's and women's colleges, and, later in the century, to Toynbee Hall. A visit to the United States in 1888 resulted in <span class="italic">Notes on American Schools and Colleges</span> (1890), and he returned excited by the educational and social vitality and the strong interest in self-improvement among adults. The Chautauqua summer school and the idea of reading circles greatly attracted him and his article on &#145;The Chautauqua reading circles&#146; in the 1888 <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> stimulated J. B. Paton to begin a similar movement. Fitch worked to bring rigour and coherence to the unco-ordinated teaching and organization of university extension classes and, while welcoming provincial colleges of university status, he preferred continued affiliation to London University to independence, fearing a narrowing of access, for example, to part-time students. As a governor of University College and a convocation member of the university senate from 1875, he was involved in the tortuous negotiations to create a teaching university in London. An assiduous attender, he influenced the senate to support proposals for the training of teachers and in 1878 helped to secure the new charter which placed women students on equal terms with men. From early in his career he was in the vanguard of the increasingly accepted view that a liberal education was the indispensable complement to professional training for teachers.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1895 Fitch continued to write extensively, including his important 1897 study of <span class="italic">Thomas and Matthew Arnold</span> as educators, a collection of papers, <span class="italic">Educational Aims and Methods</span> (1900), and a stream of trenchant articles in a period of profound change in educational administration. He spoke at conferences, occasionally undertook work for government, as when he inspected dockyard schools, or acted as a private consultant, surveying technical education for Newcastle upon Tyne in 1897. In 1885 St Andrews University conferred on him the degree of LLD and in 1889 he was made a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by the French government for support to educational visitors to England. A knighthood in 1896 was a unique honour for an inspector, and reinforces Sadler's assessment that, &#145;no writings record so accurately as his the normal judgment of cultivated educational reformers in England during the years 1865 to 1895&#146;  (Sadler). Fitch died on 14 July 1903 at his home, 13 Leinster Square, Bayswater, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on the 18th. He was survived by <a name="cosubject_58587"></a><span class="headword">Emma Fitch <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilks]</span></span>, Lady Fitch  (1831/2&#150;1909)<span class="occ"></span>, who played a significant part in the women's movement. Described as taking &#145;a keen interest in all questions relating to the education and employment of women&#146;, she supported the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, the College for Working Women, and the Charity Organization Society. Joshua Fitch shared a number of these interests and their home was certainly a meeting place for men and women who were part of the feminist network. In 1904 she received a civil-list pension of &pound;100. Emma Fitch died at her home, 54 Abingdon Court, Kensington, London, on 1 April 1909.<br>
