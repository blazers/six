<span class="headword">Coote,  Richard</span>, first earl of Bellamont  (1636&#150;1701), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was the only son of Richard Coote, Baron Coloony (1620&#150;1683), landowner and Irish peer, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701), daughter of Sir George St George of Carrickdrumruske, co. Leitrim, and sister of the first Baron St George. Little is known of his early life. On 19 August 1680 Coote was licensed to marry Catherine (1665?&#150;1738), daughter of Bridges Nanfan of Birtsmorton, Worcestershire. Upon the death of his father on 10 July 1683 Coote succeeded to the barony.<br>
<br>In 1687 Coote fled to the Netherlands and sought the patronage of William of Orange. For fleeing to William, King James had him attainted by the Irish parliament in May 1689. But he had cast his fortune well, and after the revolution of 1688 he was rewarded with the office of treasurer for Queen Mary II, the governorship of co. Leitrim, and 77,000 acres of forfeited land, and was made first earl of Bellamont on 2 November 1689. He had also become a friend of the whig junto, who were happy to see him installed in the House of Commons representing Droitwich in 1689. An ardent whig, he got into trouble in 1693 for attacking Lord Coningsby for corruption. Coningsby was a particular favourite of King William, so Bellamont lost his position in the royal household.<br>
<br>Coote was always in need of funds and preferment, and in 1695 the whig lords finally got William to assent to his being named governor of Massachusetts. When the salary was deemed insufficient, he was made governor of New York and New Hampshire as well. His financial condition also involved him in what proved to be a dangerous scheme. Robert Livingston, a New York merchant, and William Kidd, a celebrated pirate, put forward a scheme in 1695 that would be financed by Bellamont, Livingston, and the whig lords Shrewsbury, Somers, Orford, and Romney, and with the king a secret partner. The scheme was to have Kidd go out and capture the pirates who were bedevilling English trade and return with their booty to be processed outside the Admiralty courts to the benefit of the partners. Meanwhile, Bellamont immediately fell into the partisan politics of New York. The rebellion of Jacob Leisler at the time of the revolution of 1688 lingered, with vicious political infighting between the Leislerians and the anti-Leislerians. Bellamont tried to remain a friend to both sides but found himself allied with the Leislerians. Massachusetts offered no relief as he fought with the colony's leaders about trade regulation, his salary (which the legislature cut), and a new law against piracy.<br>
<br>The real danger to Bellamont's career, however, came from his relationship with Kidd. The latter had gone off to the Indian Ocean, where he committed piracy and consorted with pirates on the island of St Maries, just off Madagascar. His progress had enraged the East India Company, which conducted a campaign against him in England. What made this dangerous was that the whigs had lost power and the tories saw Kidd's actions as a way of embarrassing the whig junto that had supported him. The government sent out notices to the colonies in November 1698 ordering the arrest of Kidd, who was on his way back to North America. Bellamont was in Boston when Kidd gingerly sailed into New York, where his partner Robert Livingston brought him up to date. Kidd started to negotiate with Bellamont while sailing off Connecticut. Bellamont had to balance the fact that he was still in partnership with the whig lords and Kidd, versus his orders from the government to arrest him. Kidd arrived in Boston, where, after talking to him, Bellamont had him arrested. He then went on the hunt for the money and goods Kidd had been leaving with friends and relatives. Kidd and his recovered loot were sent to England, where he testified in the Commons about the partnership. He never gave the tories the evidence they wanted, and he was hanged for piracy after trial. Before Kidd was put to death Bellamont had died in Bowling Green, New York, on 5 March 1701. He was buried in New York; in 1790 his casket was placed in St Paul's churchyard, New York.<br>
