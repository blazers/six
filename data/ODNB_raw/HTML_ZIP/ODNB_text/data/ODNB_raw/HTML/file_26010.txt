<span class="headword">Somerset,  Henry</span>, second duke of Beaufort  (1684&#150;1714), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 April 1684 at Monmouth Castle, the son of Charles Somerset, marquess of Worcester (1660&#150;1698), and his wife, Rebecca (1665/6&#150;1712), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5290/', "Sir Josiah Child")</script> of Wanstead. His father having died in a coach accident in July 1698, Henry became the second duke of Beaufort on the death of his paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26009/', "Henry Somerset, first duke")</script>, on 21 January 1700. He married his first wife, Mary (1683&#150;1705), the daughter of Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset, on 7 July 1702 at Knole, Kent. In the same year he entertained Queen Anne and Prince George at the family's residence at Badminton. As a &#145;thorough-going tory&#146; Beaufort removed himself from mainstream court politics during the years of the whig junto, establishing instead a high-tory drinking society, the Honourable Board of Loyal Brotherhood, in 1709.<br>
<br>The collapse of the whig administration in the following year prompted Beaufort to take an active role in the new ministry of Robert Harley. It was only now, as he informed Anne, that he &#145;could call her Queen in reality&#146;. On 13 December 1710 he was sworn of the privy council, and in the same year he became lord lieutenant of Hampshire (he was made lord lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 1712). Beaufort's wealth, an estimated annual rent roll of &pound;30,000, was directed towards promoting tory fortunes in Monmouthshire, and in the final years of Anne's reign was concentrated on the Bolingbroke/Jacobite interest. His first wife died in childbirth on 18 June 1705, and on 26 February 1706 Beaufort married Rachel Noel (<i>d</i>. 1709), the daughter and coheir of Wriothesley, second earl of Gainsborough. She also died in childbirth, on 13 September 1709. His third wife was Mary Osborne (1688&#150;1722), the daughter of Peregrine, second duke of Leeds, whom he married on 14 September 1711. He died at Badminton, Gloucestershire, on 24 May 1714 from an inflammation brought on by having drunk considerable amounts of alcohol after exercise, and was buried there. The title passed first to his son, also Henry Somerset (1707&#150;1745), from his second marriage and then, in February 1745, to the second duke's third but next surviving son, <a name="cosubject_74104"></a><span class="headword">Charles Noel Somerset</span>, fourth duke of Beaufort  (1709&#150;1756), <span class="occ">politician</span>.<br>
<br>Charles Noel Somerset was born on 12 September 1709 and educated at Westminster School and University College, Oxford, where he matriculated in June 1725 and graduated MA (1727) and DCL (1736). A staunch tory like his father, Charles was elected MP for Monmouthshire in 1731 and sat for Monmouth borough between 1734 and 1745, when he assumed the dukedom on his brother's death. A determined critic of the Walpole administration and an advocate of the Jacobite cause, Somerset emerged in 1744 as the head of the parliamentary tory party after Lord Gower's move to join the broad-bottom ministry. Despite his support of the Stuarts, Beaufort's involvement in the planning for French involvement in the 1745 Jacobite rising went unpunished. Towards the close of the decade he was active in securing the support of Frederick, prince of Wales, for the tories, though in these years the duke never matched the dynamic leadership that he achieved in the period immediately after 1744. On 1 May 1740 he had married Elizabeth (1718/19&#150;1799), the daughter of John Symes Berkeley of Stoke Gifford, Gloucestershire, and the sister of the future colonial governor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62531/', "Norborne Berkeley")</script>. Beaufort died on 28 October 1756 and was buried at Badminton, whereupon the dukedom passed to his son, Henry Somerset (1744&#150;1803).<br>
