<span class="headword">Turner,  Richard</span>  (1790&#150;1846), <span class="occ">temperance activist</span>, was born on 25 July 1790 in Bilsborough, the youngest of five children. He had poor sight following a childhood attack of measles. He became a spinner in a Preston cotton mill, but disliked the restricted life and left at the age of seventeen. On 25 November 1817 in Preston he married Betty Cook of Preston; the couple were unable to sign the register. Betty bore him two daughters. He became a plasterer, but left his wife in 1825 and became a fish hawker&#151;hence his nickname Cockle Dick.<br>
<br>Early in the 1830s an alliance between progressive provincial middle-class reformers and respectable working men was seizing control of the London-based anti-spirits movement from its well-to-do leaders and converting it into a broader-based total abstinence crusade against all alcoholic drinks. Not entirely sober one evening in 1832, Turner entered a Preston temperance meeting for a joke but came out converted. He was among the pioneering &#145;seven men&#146; of Preston who signed the pledge of total abstinence in that year. He became a Wesleyan Sunday school teacher and an enthusiastic if unsophisticated temperance advocate&#151;the sort of convert to respectability whose transformed life the new movement liked to advertise. His strong dialect and ungrammatical turns of phrase often made him unintentionally amusing, but his dark and ruddy complexion, coarse features, and shabby clothes gave him a hold over the type of working man the total abstainers sought to reach.<br>
<br>It was on the teetotal platform in September 1833 that Dicky, as temperance reformers affectionately called him, won his modest place in British history. Dismissing the anti-spirits movement's idea of imposing a pledge only to moderation in wine and beer, he announced amid cheers that &#145;nothing but the tee-total would do&#146; or, according to some accounts, &#145;I'll be reet down out-and-out t-t-total for ever and ever&#146;. This gave the total abstinence movement the eye-catching label it needed. There was much subsequent controversy about who invented the word and how to spell its derivatives. Irishmen had long used it to denote &#145;complete&#146; or &#145;permanent&#146;, and Irish labourers brought it to Lancashire; Turner did not invent the term, but merely gave it a new and more specialist application. Like many titles embraced by new reforming movements, it was at first thought rather vulgar.<br>
<br>Turner suffered from asthma for many years, but persisted with his rather eccentric temperance lecturing. In later life he had to be subsidized by the teetotal movement and lived with his eldest sister. In August 1846 he walked from Preston to the World's Temperance Convention in London, preaching teetotalism on the way. On 27 October 1846 he died in Preston when he burst a blood vessel during a fit of coughing, and was buried in St Peter's churchyard, Preston.<br>
