<span class="headword">Walrond,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>b. </em>1602, <em>d.</em> in or after 1668), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was the eldest son of Humphrey Walrond (<i>d</i>. 1621) of Sea, in the parish of Ilminster, Somerset, and his wife, Elizabeth Colles. He had six siblings: Maurice, Edward, John, George, Katherine, and Elizabeth. No later than 1623 Humphrey Walrond married Grace, daughter of Dr John Seaman of Painswick, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Elizabeth. Grace and Humphrey Walrond had ten children. Four of their five sons&#151;George (1624&#150;1688), Henry, John (1634&#150;1674), and Thomas&#151;followed their father into prominent positions in the political life of Barbados.<br>
<br>Little is known of the first forty years of Walrond's life, other than his involvement in the west fen drainage scheme in Lincolnshire in the early 1630s. Richard Ligon, a friend of Walrond in Barbados, invested in a nearby fen drainage scheme, and it is possible that the two men met at this time.<br>
<br>In April 1643 Walrond appears in the records as having executed a deed intended to satisfy his debts and distribute the remainder of his estate to his family in the event of his death. He next appears in July 1645, when the defeated royalist garrison of Bridgwater handed him over to parliament as a hostage to guarantee the terms of its surrender. Despite this fact, Walrond's actions during the civil wars remain unclear. In a petition provided to parliament in October 1645, while he was still a prisoner, he claimed that he had not accepted a commission from the king. Instead, he claimed that he protected supporters of parliament, in return for which he was robbed and forced to flee to Bridgwater. Apparently contradicting these claims, he received a grant of arms by Charles I for his services in the conflict, and may have served as deputy governor of Bridgwater, perhaps holding the rank of colonel. In addition, after the Restoration his wife and children claimed that his loyalty during the civil wars entitled them to compensation of various sorts. These claims could not, it seems, be verified. In any case, his petition to compound was granted in June 1646, and soon afterward he left England for Barbados, accompanied by his brother Edward and son George. He had arrived by early October 1646.<br>
<br>Humphrey Walrond and his brother were to become major figures in Barbados in the 1640s, but there is reason to doubt the long-standing portrayal of Humphrey as a staunch royalist and the history of Barbados in the 1640s as an extension of the civil war. From the mid-1640s, Barbados was transformed by sugar and plantation slavery. The island's major planters, supported by Governor Philip Bell, pursued profits and effective home rule by placing their interests as sugar planters above politics. Ligon's <span class="italic">True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados</span> (1657) is a valuable source for this transformation and the careful neutrality of the island's planters, who informally forbade use of the words &#145;cavalier&#146; and &#145;roundhead&#146;. But home rule depended on the distractions of war in England, and after the execution of Charles I parliament sought to re-establish control of the island. Humphrey Walrond responded by urging an alliance with the Bermuda colony to resist parliament. After this plan was rejected, he managed to stir up dissent among the planters by claiming that parliament was behind a thwarted 1650 uprising among the island's servants. In April that year he had become a central figure in the &#145;rebellion&#146; on Barbados, playing on his fellow sugar planters' many fears: that title to their plantations was insecure, that the exploding population of servants and African slaves on the island threatened their safety, and that close oversight of their affairs would restrict the new and very profitable sugar trade.<br>
<br>Walrond had come very close to seizing control of the island when Francis Willoughby, fifth Baron Willoughby of Parham, arrived in possession of the proprietary rights to the island of James Hay, third earl of Carlisle, and an appointment as governor of Barbados from Charles II. Walrond was able to delay Willoughby's accession for three months, but no longer. Willoughby tried to placate parliament and retain the island's home rule by, among other things, dismissing Humphrey and Edward Walrond from their posts, but in October 1650 parliament cut off all trade with Barbados and began assembling a fleet to bring the island to heel. The fleet finally arrived in late 1651, and the island surrendered in January 1652. The settlement, known as the charter of Barbados, required Humphrey and Edward to leave the island for a year, and forbade them to return without the permission of parliament. Both returned to England.<br>
<br>Humphrey Walrond was back in Barbados in October 1656, and in 1660 Willoughby appointed him president of the council. His three-year tenure was eventful. As he had been in the 1640s, he was a strong proponent of home rule. He was outspoken in the struggle over revoking the proprietorship of Barbados (on the authority of which his own office depended) in favour of a royal governor. Some of his fellow planters proposed an export duty in exchange for secure title to their lands. He opposed the export duty and even argued for Barbados's exclusion from the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>, which controlled imperial trade, on the questionable grounds that sugar was no longer a profitable commodity. Home rule was simply no longer an option in the 1660s, but with characteristic directness Walrond refused to moderate his views, and in 1661 he dissolved the Barbadian assembly for disagreeing with them.<br>
<br>Walrond's most controversial policy was to trade surplus African slaves to Spanish merchants in Martinique, in direct violation of both the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> and the decision of the Barbados council. As a result of this decision, in 1663 Philip IV of Spain granted him several titles&#151;marquess of Vallado, count of Valderonda, and count of Parama. It is uncertain whether Walrond ever received the patent for these titles, but there exists no better example of his willingness to march to his own tune. Although his decision was later approved by authorities in England, he refused to relinquish the commission paid to him by the Spanish, perhaps using the money to build the grand stone residence appropriated by Willoughby as the governor's mansion.<br>
<br>The decision to trade with Spain was one of Walrond's gravest miscalculations, and it was compounded by his order that planters on Barbados be freed of prosecution for debt. Not only was this order issued without consulting the colony's assembly, but it suspiciously eased his own financial problems. In 1663 Willoughby returned to the colony, now as the royal governor. He called on Walrond to account for the sums owed to the crown from the Spanish commission, as well as others he was said to have appropriated, and Walrond resisted. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, he was reported to be riding around the island with armed servants, inciting the planters to rebellion. Despite Willoughby's efforts to arrest him and threats to prosecute his allies for sedition and treason, Walrond demonstrated that he retained some support on the island by successfully evading the patrols and eventually escaping Barbados.<br>
<br>After his flight from Barbados, Walrond appeared in England, where the privy council ordered him to be imprisoned. Again he escaped, and little is known of his life after this point. In 1668 his wife, Grace, petitioned the king on his behalf, claiming that he had left England and asking that he be allowed to reappear and defend himself. There is no record of a reply, and given the many warrants for his arrest, this is hardly surprising. He does not resurface after this date, and it is assumed that he died soon afterwards.<br>
