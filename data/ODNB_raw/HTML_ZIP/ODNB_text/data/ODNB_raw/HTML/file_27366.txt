<span class="headword">Thornton, Sir  William</span>  (1779?&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the elder son of William Thornton of Muff, near Londonderry, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Perrott James of Magilligan. He obtained a commission as ensign in the 89th foot on 31 March 1796, and served with it in Ireland. He was promoted lieutenant in the 46th foot on 1 March 1797, and captain on 25 June 1803. Early in 1803 he had been appointed aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir James Henry Craig, then inspector-general of infantry. On Craig's appointment as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Thornton accompanied him as aide-de-camp in April 1805, arriving at Malta on 18 July. On 3 November he left Malta with Craig in the expedition to Naples, to co-operate with the Russians under General Maurice Lacy; after disembarking at Castellamare, in the Bay of Naples, on 20 November, Thornton took part in the operations for the defence of the Neapolitan frontier. On 14 January 1806, the Russian troops having withdrawn to Corfu, Thornton embarked at Castellamare with the British army for Messina; after disembarkation, which did not take place until 17 February, he was busy with his general in organizing the defence of the fortress. In April Thornton returned to England with Craig, who had resigned because of ill health.<br>
<br>Thornton next served as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Earl Ludlow, commanding the Kent military district, and on 13 November 1806 he was promoted major in the Royal York rangers. He was in temporary command of the regiment in Guernsey until August 1807; he then went to Canada as military secretary and first aide-de-camp to Craig, who had been appointed governor-in-chief and captain-general in British North America. On 28 January 1808 Thornton was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel, and appointed inspecting field-officer of militia in Canada, in addition to his other duties. He returned to England with Craig in 1811, and on 1 August of that year was brought into the 34th foot as a lieutenant-colonel. On 23 January 1812 he was transferred from the 34th and became lieutenant-colonel commanding the Greek light infantry corps, and assistant military secretary to the commander-in-chief, the duke of York. On 25 January 1813 he was given the command of the 85th light infantry.<br>
<br>In July 1813 Thornton went to the Peninsula in command of the 85th, and took part in the siege of San Sebasti&aacute;n. He commanded the regiment at the passages of the Bidassoa, Nivelle, Nive, and Adour rivers, and in all the operations of the left wing of Wellington's army, including the siege of Bayonne.<br>
<br>In May 1814 Thornton embarked with the 85th at Bordeaux, and sailed in the expedition under Major-General Robert Ross for North America. He was promoted brevet colonel on 4 June 1814 for his services in the Peninsula. He landed with the expedition on 19 August at St Benedict's on the Patuxent, and was given the command of a brigade consisting of the 85th foot, the light infantry companies of the 4th, 21st, and 44th regiments, and a company of marines. The army marched on Washington by way of Nottingham and Marlborough, Thornton leading with his light brigade. On 24 August the enemy were met at Bladensburg, where they were posted in a most advantageous position on rising ground on the other side of and above the river. Thornton pushed quickly through the town, and although suffering much from the fire of the enemy's guns when crossing the bridge, he was no sooner over than, spreading out his front, he advanced to attack. He was severely wounded, and, the enemy being completely defeated, he was left at Bladensburg when the British army advanced to and entered Washington.<br>
<br>In reprisal for American burning of the public buildings at York (later Toronto) in April 1813, the British force on the night of 24 August burned the Washington public buildings, including the Capitol and the president's house, then withdrew on 25 August and returned to their ships. They left their wounded at Bladensburg under Commodore Burney, US Navy, who had been wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Bladensburg, and who was given parole. It was arranged with Burney that Thornton and the other wounded should be considered prisoners of war of the Americans, and exchanged as soon as they were fit to travel. Early in October Burney himself escorted Thornton and the other prisoners in a schooner to join the British fleet in the James River, where the British army, after the failure at Baltimore and the death of Ross, had embarked.<br>
<br>Thornton sailed with the army on board the fleet to Jamaica, where Major-General Keane, having arrived from England with reinforcements, took command. The expedition sailed on 26 November for New Orleans, which was reached on 10 December; but it was 21 December before all the troops were landed on Pine Island in Lake Borgne. An advance guard, consisting of the 4th, 85th, and 95th regiments, was formed under Thornton's command, and, embarking in boats, proceeded up the creek Bayo de Catiline by night to within a few miles of New Orleans on its northern side, where they landed and established themselves. After repulsing a night attack with considerable loss, the advance guard was reinforced gradually by the arrival in detachments of the main body, and the whole army was in position by 25 December, when Sir Edward Michael Pakenham arrived from England and took command. After an ineffectual attack on 27 December Thornton was busy cutting a canal across the neck of land between Bayo de Catiline and the river. This was completed on 6 January 1815, when he embarked the 85th and other details, amounting to under 400 men, crossed the river on the night of 7 January and took a gallant part in the attack of 8 January, gaining on his side of the river a complete success. Storming the entrenchments, he put the enemy to flight, capturing eighteen guns and the camp of that position. In this attack he was severely wounded, and learning in the moment of his victory of the death of Pakenham and the disastrous failure of the main attack, he retired to his boats, recrossed the river, and joined the main body. The reunited army retreated to the fleet and re-embarked. Thornton was sent to England, where he arrived in March 1815. He was made a CB, military division.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1819 Thornton was appointed deputy adjutant-general in Ireland. He was promoted major-general on 27 May 1825, and appointed colonel of the 96th foot on 10 October 1834. He was made a KCB in September 1836, and lieutenant-general on 28 June 1838. On the death of Sir Herbert Taylor he was transferred to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 85th light infantry, on 9 April 1839. For the last few years of his life he resided in the village of Greenford, near Hanwell, Middlesex. He became subject to delusions&#151;that he had been accused of smuggling, and that he possessed forged banknotes&#151;and shot himself at about seven o'clock in the morning on 6 April 1840 at his residence, Stanhope Lodge, Greenford. He was buried on the same day in Greenford churchyard. He was unmarried. The order announcing his death to the 85th stated it was &#145;to his unremitted zeal and noble example the regiment is principally indebted for that high character which it has ever since maintained&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 649).<br>
