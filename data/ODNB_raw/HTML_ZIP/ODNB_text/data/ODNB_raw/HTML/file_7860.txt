<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  Archibald</span>, lord of Liddesdale  (1294?&#150;1333), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7922/', "Sir William Douglas (d. 1298)")</script>, lord of Douglas [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49418/', "Douglas family")</script>], and his second wife, Eleanor de Ferrers (<i>d</i>. after 1305). He was possibly born in 1294, as a two-year-old son of William Douglas, either Archibald or his elder brother Hugh, is recorded at William's manor of Stebbing, Essex, in 1296. By the time Archibald reached adulthood, his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7889/', "Sir James Douglas")</script>, had emerged as a key adherent of Robert I and Archibald benefited from the connection. During the 1320s he received estates at Morebattle in Roxburghshire and Kirkandrews in Dumfriesshire, and was granted Crimond and Rattray in Aberdeenshire; in 1327 he participated in the invasion of England.<br>
<br>Archibald Douglas's importance grew in the aftermath of the death of Sir James Douglas in 1330, when he became tutor to the latter's son. He himself married Beatrice (<i>d</i>. after 1337), daughter of Alexander Lindsay of Crawford, and their infant daughter Eleanor married Alexander Bruce, earl of Carrick, extending Archibald's connections. The losses among the Bruce party at Dupplin Moor on 11 August 1332 increased Archibald's significance and he engineered Edward Balliol's defeat at Annan at the end of the year. This military role and the Douglas reputation made him a natural choice for guardian of Scotland after the capture of Sir Andrew Murray in April 1333. He used his authority to personal advantage, illegally occupying Liddesdale and other southern lands. When Edward III laid siege to Berwick in May, Archibald raised an army and devastated northern England. This tactic failed to force Edward's withdrawal and Douglas marched to relieve Berwick. On 19 July at Halidon Hill he was defeated and killed in the attempt. His sons, John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7924/', "William Douglas")</script>, fled into exile, and Archibald was remembered as the Tyneman or loser for this defeat, but his career shows he recognized the link between war and lordship which would allow William to become first earl of Douglas.<br>
