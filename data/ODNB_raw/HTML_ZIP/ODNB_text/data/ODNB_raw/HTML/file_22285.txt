<span class="headword">Pim,  Bedford Clapperton Trevelyan</span>  (1826&#150;1886), <span class="occ">naval officer and barrister</span>, was born on 12 June 1826 at Bideford, Devon, son of Lieutenant Edward Bedford Pim. His father died of yellow fever off the coast of Africa in 1830, when he was engaged in the suppression of the slave trade, in command of the <i>Black Joke</i>, tender to the <i>Dryad</i>. His mother was Sophia Soltau, eldest daughter of John Fairweather Harrison. Pim was educated at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, and entered the navy in 1842. He served under Captain Henry Kellett on the <i>Herald</i> from 1845 to 1849. In that year he was lent for duty on the brig <i>Plover</i>; having wintered in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, he made a journey in March and April 1850 to Mikhailovsky in search of Sir John Franklin. Pim returned to England on 6 June 1851, having been promoted lieutenant on 20 October 1850.<br>
<br>At this period Pim proposed an expedition in search of Franklin to the north coast of Asia, and offered to survey the coast. After receiving a grant of &pound;500 from Lord John Russell, unlimited leave from the Admiralty, and recommendations to the authorities in St Petersburg, he went to Russia in November 1851, but the Russian government refused to permit his project. On 21 April 1852 he left England on board the <i>Resolute</i>, and served under Sir Edward Belcher in the western division of his Arctic search expedition. In the following October, when the <i>Resolute</i> was in winter quarters off Melville Island, a travelling party discovered in a cairn on the island the information (placed there by McClure the previous April) that McClure's ship, the <i>Investigator</i>, was ice-bound in Mercy Harbour, Banks Land, 160 miles off. It was too late in the season to attempt a communication, but on 10 March 1853 Pim was sent as a volunteer in charge of a sledge to Banks Land. The journey was accomplished in twenty-eight days: on 6 April Pim safely reached the vessel, only just in time to relieve the sick and enfeebled crew.<br>
<br>In January 1855 Pim was appointed to the command of the gunboat <i>Magpie</i>, and did good service in the Baltic. He was wounded at the bombardment of Sveaborg on 10 August 1855. In April 1857 he was appointed to the command of the <i>Banterer</i> in the war with China, and was severely wounded at Sai Lau, Canton River, on 14 December 1857. On 19 April 1858 he was promoted commander and in June was invalided home. In June 1859 he was appointed to the <i>Gorgon</i>, for service in Central America. While stationed off Grey Town he originated and surveyed the Nicaraguan route for an isthmian canal through Mosquito and Nicaragua. While on the station he purchased a bay on the Atlantic shore, for which he was censured by the lords of the Admiralty in May 1860. He returned to England in June, and, retaining the command of the <i>Gorgon</i>, took her to the Cape of Good Hope in January 1861. On his way home he exchanged into the <i>Fury</i>. The following June Pim retired from active service; his name, however, remained on the navy list, and he was promoted captain on 16 April 1868 (he was raised to the rank of rear-admiral on the retired list in 1885).<br>
<br>On 3 October 1861 Pim married Susanna, daughter of Henry Locock of Blackheath, London; they had two sons. Pim made three journeys to Nicaragua, in March 1863, October 1863, and November 1864, to pursue his transit scheme. After he had obtained additional concessions, in November 1866 a company, called the Nicaraguan Railway Company, Limited, was registered; but the necessary capital was not forthcoming, and the company was dissolved in July 1868.<br>
<br>Pim now turned his attention to the law. In 1870 he entered as student of the Inner Temple (20 April) and of Gray's Inn (28 November), and was called to the bar on 27 January 1873. He was admitted a barrister of Gray's Inn <i>ad eundem</i> the following month. His practice was almost exclusively confined to Admiralty cases, and he went on the western circuit. At Bristol his name became a household word among seamen. He represented Gravesend as a Conservative from 1874 to 1880, but lost the seat at the following general election. He was elected FRGS in November 1851, and on 9 April 1861 an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. On 28 January 1862 he laid before the institution his mode of fastening armour-plates on vessels by double dovetail rivets. He was on the first council of the Anthropological Institute (1871&#150;4) and remained a member of the institute until his death. His varied publications included propaganda for his canal proposal.<br>
<br>Pim died at Deal on 30 September 1886, in his sixty-first year; his wife survived him. A brass tablet and window were placed in his memory at the west end of the church of the Seamen's Institute, Bristol, by the pilots of the British empire and the United States of America in 1888. Pim was a highly intelligent, determined, and resourceful man of wide-ranging interests. His courage in the Arctic and under fire earned him promotion to captain, but his lack of interest forced him to consider another career. In the law he was as successful as he had been in the navy.<br>
