<span class="headword">Parkes <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Belloc]</span>,  Elizabeth Rayner <span class="st"> [Bessie]</span></span>  (1829&#150;1925), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights and journalist</span>, was born in Birmingham on 16 June 1829, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21356/', "Joseph Parkes (1796&#150;1865)")</script>, a lawyer and politician, and of Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797?&#150;1877), who was the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22788/', "Joseph Priestley")</script>, the philosopher and scientist. The Unitarian background of both parents, her father's political connections, and the culture of radical dissent inherited from her mother's family meant that her upbringing was less circumscribed intellectually than might have been expected for a young woman of the affluent middle class of her day. From the age of eleven she attended a boarding-school run by the Unitarian Revd William Field at Leam House, near Warwick, where his daughter Lucy was the first of a number of highly intelligent women to make an impact on the impressionable Bessie, as she was universally known. In 1833, on her father's appointment as secretary to the commission on municipal corporations, the family moved to London, to the first of three London residences in Great George Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>Joseph Parkes was a dominant influence on his daughter. Family life was outwardly conventional, but an unspoken and irrevocable rift developed between her parents. Elizabeth Parkes's sympathies were with their son, Priestley, whose developing consumption led them in 1847 to take a house in Pelham Crescent, Hastings, on the Sussex coast, in the hope that sea air would prove beneficial. It was in Hastings that the Parkes family met the unorthodox family of Benjamin Leigh Smith and his five children. There Bessie formed one of the most significant friendships of her life, with Barbara Leigh Smith, later Bodichon, whom she was later to describe as &#145;the most powerful woman I have ever known&#146;  (M. Belloc Lowndes, <span class="italic">A Passing World</span>, 1897, 21). Their relationship was one of creative interaction. They were a source of mutual education; they read and travelled together, and when apart wrote to one another about what they read&#151;an impressive catalogue of literature and philosophy from Shakespeare, Bacon, and John Stuart Mill through to the work of contemporaries such as Harriet Martineau, Tennyson, and George Sand. In 1848 they began to contribute articles and reviews to two local newspapers with which they had connections, the <span class="italic">Hastings and St. Leonards News</span> and the <span class="italic">Birmingham Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Another significant if less intense friendship was formed at the same time with Marian Evans, whom Bessie had met in Coventry through their mutual friend Sara Hennell. The future George Eliot was beginning her career as a translator and journalist and Joseph Parkes had been the principal contributor to a fund established to publish her translation of J. F. Strauss's <span class="italic">Leben Jesu</span>. Marian Evans was a much sought-after guest in the Parkes's household, and Bessie memorably described the young George Eliot in retrospect in an article in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> (February 1894; repr. in <span class="italic">In a Walled Garden</span>, 1895). To Marian Evans, Bessie Parkes was one of a number of admiring younger women by whom she was to be surrounded for much of her life. It was nevertheless to her that she confided her decision to live with George Henry Lewes shortly before their departure for the continent in 1854 and it was to Bessie, more than a quarter of a century later, that she wrote one of her last letters.<br>
<br>In Barbara Leigh Smith, Bessie Parkes had a friend who was more of an equal, in age and in family background. They were bound by their creative ambitions: Barbara's to be a painter, and Bessie a poet. They were bound together, too, by a conviction that women's lives were unnecessarily restricted&#151;legally, and in terms of the possibilities for education and employment.<blockquote>I believe that now, as in all ages of the world, the substantial equality of nature renders the two sexes of equal weight and value in the moral world, and that their action upon each other in every relation of life is far too complex to admit of any great difference between them in any given rank</blockquote>Bessie wrote in the introduction to her <span class="italic">Essays on Women's Work</span> (1865). That principle was at the heart of a decade's vigorous campaigning for more equality of opportunity for women.<br>
<br>Bessie Parkes's <span class="italic">Remarks on the Education of Girls</span>, published by John Chapman in 1854, outlined the need to extend women's education by encouraging wider, uncensored reading, and by introducing women to the study of subjects such as social and political economy to enable them to participate meaningfully in public affairs. In 1855 Barbara Leigh Smith and Bessie Parkes formed a committee to submit a petition in support of a <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Bill</span> then before parliament. The petition failed but their appetite for action was whetted. In October 1856, while on a visit to Edinburgh, Bessie's attention was caught by the <span class="italic">Waverley Journal</span>, a fortnightly &#145;edited and published by ladies for the cultivation of the memorable, the progressive, and the beautiful&#146;, to which she contributed and also briefly edited. Eventually, in consultation with Barbara Leigh Smith and with Anna Jameson, who was a sympathetic supporter of the two younger women, it was decided to establish an entirely new periodical based in London, the <span class="italic">English Woman's Journal</span>, whose premises at 19 Langham Place were to become the focus of a number of interconnected enterprises devoted to widening education and employment opportunities for women. The <span class="italic">Journal</span> was established as a joint-stock company, with Barbara Leigh Smith as the major shareholder and Bessie and Matilda Mary (Max) Hays, actress, novelist, and translator, as co-editors. It sold for a shilling, and subscribers were entitled to the use of a reading- and meeting-room at Langham Place.<br>
<br>Bessie Parkes was the major single contributor to the <span class="italic">Journal</span> and her views effectively shaped its policies. George Eliot declined to contribute, pleading total commitment to her novel writing, but became a subscriber and adviser. &#145;The more business you can get into the journal&#151;the more statements of philanthropic movements and social facts, and the less literature, the better&#146;, she counselled Bessie  (<span class="italic">George Eliot Letters</span>, 2.379). Bessie was in complete agreement. The journal was never intended to compete with major literary organs of the day. &#145;Such an idea would have been perfectly hopeless and absurd, and indeed self-destructive&#146;, she wrote later  (<span class="italic">Essays on Woman's Work</span>, 63). Of philanthropic movements and social facts there were plenty, particularly on women's employment and on women's education, where the combined influence of Jessie Boucherett, Maria Rye, Adelaide Anne Procter, Isa Craig, and Emily Faithfull, among others, filtered through. On the question of women's suffrage there was virtually nothing, Bessie believing it an impracticable aim.<br>
<br>Bessie was temporarily replaced as editor for six months in 1862 by Emily Davies but returned in 1863. Eventually the journal foundered, riven by internal debates and differences&#151;personal, religious, and political&#151;among its chief supporters. The entire management was transferred to Bessie in August 1864, but soon after the company was officially dissolved. It continued in spirit as the <span class="italic">Alexandra Magazine and English Woman's Journal</span> until 1865, when Jessie Boucherett refashioned it as the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>, which lasted until 1903.<br>
<br>Bessie's career as a poet, meanwhile, had made a modest beginning. A volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> was published by Chapman in 1852 and dedicated to Barbara Leigh Smith. G. H. Lewes reviewed it in <span class="italic">The Leader</span> (8 January 1853), and both he and George Eliot were encouraging. <span class="italic">Summer Sketches and other Poems</span> (1854) followed, also published by Chapman, and noticed by the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>. Notable among her subjects were female friendship, other women poets (&#145;For Adelaide&#146; [Procter], &#145;For Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#146;), and the difficulties which beset women poets (&#145;To an Author who Loved Truth more than Fame&#146;). In <span class="italic">Summer Sketches</span> there was an attempt to tackle aspects of the &#145;woman question&#146;, in advance of Barrett Browning's <span class="italic">Aurora Leigh</span>. Other poems celebrated places familiar to her childhood, &#145;To Birmingham&#146;, &#145;Kenilworth&#146;, &#145;Stoneleigh&#146;, and &#145;Up the River&#146;, which began &#145;I am on the lilied Avon&#146;. Still others introduced direct political messages, on subjects such as public health (&#145;My Old House&#146;), a colliery disaster, and the death of the prince consort (&#145;The palace and the colliery&#146;), and the poet's political mission (&#145;Poets of 1848&#146;).<br>
<br>From the early 1860s Bessie had become increasingly attracted to the Roman Catholic faith, possibly encouraged by her friendship with Adelaide Procter, and influenced crucially by a meeting with Cardinal Manning in 1864. She was received into the faith later the same year. Her <span class="italic">Essays on Woman's Work</span>, many of them collected from the <span class="italic">Journal</span>&#151;eloquent, informed, and passionate on the subject of more meaningful lives for middle-class women, and more tolerable and varied working conditions for working women&#151;were published in 1865, dedicated to the memory of Anna Jameson. The <span class="italic">Essays</span> in effect brought to an end Bessie's public contribution to the women's movement, and her conversion to Catholicism heralded a dramatic shift in her life.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1867 Bessie and Barbara Bodichon, returning from a holiday in the south of France, took a chalet on the estate of Louise Swanton Belloc, a journalist, translator, and writer of children's books, and the widow of the French portrait painter Hilaire Belloc. An immediate rapport developed between Bessie and Madame Belloc, and, what was more unlikely, between Bessie and Louis Belloc (1830&#150;1872), her semi-invalid son, who was a barrister. Bessie's ten-year engagement to her cousin Samuel Blackwell had recently ended and she had also refused a proposal of marriage from the blind Liberal MP Henry Fawcett, later the husband of Millicent Garrett. To the surprise of Madame Belloc and the consternation of her friends and family Bessie announced her intention of marrying Louis Belloc, which she did on 19 September 1867. This unlikely union proved to be brief and extremely happy. Two children were born in quick succession, Marie, later the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39089/', "Marie Belloc Lowndes")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30699/', "Hilaire Belloc")</script>, the essayist and poet.<br>
<br>The marriage engendered in Bessie, whose French was already fluent, a love affair with all things French which transmitted itself to both her children. According to Marie Belloc Lowndes, she described the five years of her marriage, and nine further years spent at La Celle St Cloud, the Belloc home 12 miles from Paris, as the happiest of her life. The five years of her marriage included the Franco-Prussian War of 1870&#150;71, the dramatic evacuation and near devastation of La Celle St Cloud, and a flight to London, movingly described through Bessie's letters in Belloc Lowndes's memoir, <span class="italic">I, too, have Lived in Arcadia: a Record of Love and of Childhood</span> (1941). Louis Belloc died suddenly in 1872 from the effects of sunstroke. An inheritance from her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21357/', "Josiah Parkes")</script>, a successful engineer, in 1871 enabled Bessie to live comfortably in the early years of her widowhood, moving between London and France with her children. Then, in 1877, an investment unwisely entrusted to the son of a friend who had become her lodger failed, leaving her for the first time in her life in financially precarious circumstances. She withdrew from London to Slindon Cottage, the dower house of the Slindon estate in Sussex, brought to her notice by Lady Georgiana Fullerton, a move which delighted her son but appalled her daughter, who pronounced her mother unsuited to country life. She none the less made Slindon her English home for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>Widowhood brought with it the resumption of old friendships, in particular that with Barbara Bodichon, but not the resumption of an active public life. Bessie's ties with her French family were strengthened, particularly with her mother-in-law and two of her late husband's sisters. She continued to write intermittently. <span class="italic">La belle France</span> (1868) and <span class="italic">Peoples of the World</span> (1870) were commissioned in the first years of her marriage. <span class="italic">In a Walled Garden</span> (1895) and <span class="italic">A Passing World</span> (1897), two collections of reminiscences and historical sketches, contain fragments of autobiography and family history and record her interlocking circles of acquaintances and friends. Her last collection of poems, <span class="italic">In Fifty Years</span>, was published in 1904. In some ways the most remarkable of all her writings are her letters, preserved along with a manuscript diary and reminiscences at Girton College, Cambridge, and published selectively in <span class="italic">I, too, have Lived in Arcadia</span>. Her children embarked on successful literary careers and remained close to her. She died peacefully on 29 March 1925, aged ninety-five, and was buried in the churchyard of the Roman Catholic church at Slindon.<br>
