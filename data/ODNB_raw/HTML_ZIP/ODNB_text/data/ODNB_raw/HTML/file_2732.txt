<span class="headword">Boudicca <span class="st"> [Boadicea]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60/61), <span class="occ">queen of the Iceni</span>, popularly known as Boadicea since the eighteenth century as a result of misreading manuscripts of the works of the Roman historian Tacitus, was the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62307/', "Prasutagus")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48662/', "Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC&#150;AD 84)")</script>], king of the Iceni, a tribe that occupied modern-day Norfolk, eastern Cambridgeshire, and northern Suffolk. Although the Iceni are not documented before the writings of Tacitus, they are probably the same people as the Cenimagni referred to by Julius Caesar in discussing his campaign in 54 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Like the Brigantes, the Iceni had also entered into an alliance with the Romans, as Tacitus makes clear; they may have been among the eleven unnamed kingdoms recorded as submitting to Claudius (10 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>&#150;<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 54) in an inscription on a triumphal arch erected in Rome. The Iceni paid tribute, and supplied a quota of troops; but when in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47 they were deprived of their weapons, in accordance with Roman law, they rose up in revolt. Tacitus describes how they gathered in what he calls a &#145;rustic earthwork&#146;, possibly Stonea Camp, in the heart of the fens, but were swiftly overwhelmed. Whether Prasutagus was ruler at this time is not known; some assume that he became a client king in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43, but it seems more likely that he was installed in this position after the events of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47. Evidently, he was untainted by the rebellion, and his wealth was such as to be worthy of note by Tacitus. Some confirmation of the affluence of the region is provided by the discovery of nine hoards of gold and silver torcs, ingots, bracelets, and coins at Snettisham, Norfolk: although dated a century or so earlier, they surely belonged to a ruling clan. Indeed, Boudicca, who is described as coming from a royal house, is said by Cassius Dio (<i>c</i>.150&#150;235) to have worn a large golden necklace as invariable attire.<br>
<br>Prasutagus died about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60. In his will he made the Roman emperor Nero coheir to his kingdom, together with his two daughters; he hoped in this way to safeguard the future both of his family and of part of his lands, a not uncommon practice in antiquity. In the event, the estates were plundered &#145;as though the spoils of war&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.31), Boudicca was flogged and her daughters raped. Meanwhile, their neighbours the Trinovantes were suffering from the arrogant behaviour of the Roman colonists now based at Camulodunum (Colchester), who seized what they wanted at will. Furthermore, the procurator of Britain, Decianus Catus, chose that moment to call in grants made by Claudius to pro-Roman Britons, deciding that they should be regarded as loans: thus were sown the seeds for rebellion.<br>
<br>The course of events is described by both Tacitus and, much later, Cassius Dio. Tacitus would have had a firsthand account from his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola (later a distinguished governor of Britain, <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 78&#150;84), for he was on the governor's staff at the time. The governor, Gaius Suetonius Paullinus, was on the island of Mona (Anglesey), suppressing a druidical centre, when the revolt broke out in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60 or 61, and thus was powerless immediately to intervene. Camulodunum was first sacked, the final siege, which lasted two days, being of the Temple of Claudius, where the defenders took refuge; it now underlies the Norman castle. Burnt deposits encountered in almost every excavation confirm the ferocity of the assault. The ninth legion and its infantry were then ambushed and the infantry wiped out; and Poenius Postumus, the camp commander of the second legion, based at Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter), refused to march. Meanwhile Suetonius Paullinus hurried back to London with some of his troops. London was by this time a thriving town, although probably not yet the provincial capital. It was certainly an obvious target for the rebellious Iceni and Trinovantes, and Suetonius realized that, without the support of the second and ninth legions, he could not defend it. He therefore retreated, probably north-westwards along the Watling Street, to join up with the rest of his force. London was then attacked, the buildings fired (as archaeological investigation again shows), and the remaining population butchered. The rebels next moved on to Verulamium (St Albans), which received similar treatment. &#145;The Britons took no prisoners &hellip; [and] wasted no time in getting down to the bloody business of hanging, burning, and crucifying&#146;, observes Tacitus  (<span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiv.33). The official figure was that 70,000 were massacred at the three towns, and archaeology offers no dissent from this picture of a huge scale of destruction.<br>
<br>The final denouement probably took place in the midlands, although the exact site is not known. Suetonius had an army of about 10,000, while Cassius Dio estimates the British force at 230,000. The Romans took up a position in a defile, with a plain in front and dense woodland behind. Boudicca's tribesmen entered the plain, drawing up their wagons at the back, together with the women and children, as though in a grandstand. Lured into attack, the Britons were met first with a shower of javelins, and then by a disciplined assault. Hemmed in by the carts, there was a terrible slaughter of the tribespeople: 80,000 according to Tacitus. Boudicca was able to slip away, but died soon afterwards by poison  (Tacitus) or illness  (<span class="italic">Dio's Roman History</span>): the former seems the more likely. She was given a costly burial by the Britons. When Poenius Postumus heard the news of the Roman triumph, he too killed himself by falling on his sword, recognizing his indecisiveness in not moving from his base at Isca Dumnoniorum.<br>
<br>Suetonius Paullinus now took his revenge, using reinforcements brought in from the Rhine army. Although not yet satisfactorily attested archaeologically, Tacitus records that the territory of hostile or neutral tribes was laid waste with fire and sword. Fortunately, Julius Alpinus Classicianus, the procurator who replaced Decianus Catus (who had escaped to Gaul), was a provincial, probably from the Trier area of Germany, and thus had some sympathy for the position of the Britons. He made an adverse report on Suetonius and a commission of inquiry was set up: as a result, a pretext was found for the recall of Suetonius. His successor as governor, Petronius Turpilianus, was evidently not a vindictive man, and Classicianus clearly handled the financial side of the aftermath of the revolt with consideration and tact, calming down a still volatile situation.<br>
<br>Boudicca, whose name is best rendered as Victoria, very nearly ended Roman rule in Britain. She emerges in Cassius Dio's description as an awesome but heroic figure, being &#145;very tall, in appearance most terrifying &hellip; [with] a harsh voice, and with a great mass of the tawniest hair [which] fell to her hips&#146;  (lxii.2,3). This helps to explain why she became an attractive subject for writers and poets from the sixteenth century onwards, not least as a symbol of national patriotism. She has acquired a firm place in British history, with Thomas Thornycroft's great statue on the Embankment in London, erected in 1902, as a fitting reminder of the leadership and valour of the first Queen Victoria.<br>
