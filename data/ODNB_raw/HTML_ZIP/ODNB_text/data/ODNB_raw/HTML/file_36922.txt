</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Harold Herbert</span>  (1880&#150;1964), <span class="occ">literary scholar and local government administrator</span>, was born in Tokyo on 25 July 1880, the eldest son of James Williams, an Anglican missionary, and his wife, Mary Grindrod. He was educated in Tokyo, at Liverpool College, and finally at Christ's College, Cambridge, where in 1901 he was elected to a scholarship. In 1903 he gained a first class in the first part of the theological tripos, with a mark of distinction for his work on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. In the same year he was bracketed for the Carus <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> prize and won the Steel university studentship. In 1904 he was ordained deacon and priest and took up a curacy at Swimbridge, migrating to Ripon Theological College in 1905 as lecturer and chaplain; but he returned the following year to Devon as curate of Crediton, where he remained until 1909. He then relinquished orders, having seemingly come to want more freedom of judgement than was suitable for a cleric. After this time he never alluded to his clerical past.<br>
<br>Williams's freer thinking was pursued in the university extension lectures which he gave for Cambridge and London. He took his work seriously, even seeking to extend his teaching into the Oxford province. His lectures were attended by audiences sometimes 350 strong, first in Devon, then in Norfolk, Northumberland, Sussex, Lincoln, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire. As was the custom, he prepared booklets to accompany his courses, which ranged over English literature from Shakespeare upwards. The quality of these lectures may be gathered not only from his trenchantly worded syllabuses, but from his book <span class="italic">Two Centuries of the English Novel</span> (1911), which consists of estimates of a dozen of our greatest novelists, his favourites being Thackeray, Meredith, and Butler&#151;with Conrad to complete the list, on the evidence of a later book. He himself wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Discovery</span> (1913), preceded by a little book of poems, <span class="italic">The Ballad of Two Great Cities</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Williams married Jean (<i>d</i>. 1948), only daughter of Andrew Chalmers MD in 1913, and joined the army late the following year. He served with the French forces in the Vosges and later as captain with the British in the mechanical transport section of the Royal Army Service Corps. After the war he returned to academia with <span class="italic">Modern English Writers</span> (1918), presumably written while on active service. <span class="italic">Outlines of Modern English Literature, 1890&#150;1914</span> appeared in 1920. The amount of reading behind both books is immense.<br>
<br>Williams was called to the bar in 1920 (Inner Temple) without any apparent intention of practising. In 1921 he again plunged into new paths, breaking all London ties, and settling at Aspenden House, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, from which he did not return to London until 1950. He now threw himself into public duties; he served as a JP, and in 1928 began work as a Hertfordshire county councillor, becoming vice-chairman in 1939 and chairman in 1947, and remaining in that office until 1952. He was chairman of the county education committee in 1939&#150;47 and a member of the library subcommittee, of which he was chairman for over twenty years until his resignation in 1962. This subcommittee meant a great deal to him: he believed in the work the libraries were doing and did all he could to promote book borrowing. To these labours he added in 1950&#150;63 those of chairman of the local history council, and such church offices as are open to the laity.<br>
<br>The claims of authorship were not, however, neglected. Bibliography and editing became a main interest, and his scholarship was both trenchant and gracefully expressed. His first book might seem to forbid eloquence&#151;<span class="italic">Dean Swift's library with a facsimile of the original sale catalogue and some account of two manuscript lists of his books</span> (1932). A paper in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1935 attributed to Swift the <span class="italic">History of the Four Last Years of the Queen</span> (1758), and when in 1951 Herbert Davis reached this particular work in his edition of the complete prose, Williams provided him with an introduction, as he had in 1941 for <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>. Williams's important edition of Swift's poems was published in 1937, a revised edition following in 1958. The edition of the <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span> appeared in 1948.<br>
<br>On <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span> Williams was the authority: his first publication on it was in 1925, when he contributed to <span class="italic">The Library</span> &#145;The Motte editions of &#147;Gulliver's travels&#148;&#146;, almost simultaneously with his edition of the first of them for the First Edition Club, complete with a long introduction and explanatory notes. Later on Williams's discovery, made independently by an American scholar at about the same time, of the superiority of Faulkner's Dublin edition of 1735 to that of the 1726 edition provided him with the topic for his 1950 Sandars lectures at Cambridge. There was much more of Swift left for his continued labours and in 1963 the first three volumes of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> were published, followed in 1965, after his death, by the remaining two. His work on Swift was crowned by his bequest of the old books in his library to the university which had trained him in theology.<br>
<br>Williams was president of the Bibliographical Society in 1938&#150;44 and was elected FBA in 1944 and FSA in 1948. In 1951 he was knighted for his services both to bibliography and to county administration. The University of Durham conferred an honorary DLitt on him in 1954. His wife had died in 1948 and the following year he married his old friend Pauline Louise (<i>d</i>. 1969), eldest daughter of Major C. F. Campbell-Renton, of Mordington and Lamberton, Berwickshire.<br>
<br>As a person Williams was of commanding aspect, aquiline of face and straight of back. He liked presiding over public meetings and was always completely reliable in the discharge of all offices. At dinner parties&#151;for instance at the Athenaeum, of which he was a member&#151;he was an affable companion, especially when he could endlessly chat in high-pitched tones about scholarly matters. When he found his own books praised by someone he admired he could not help flushing with pleasure, having every right to be vain of his achievement in improving the twentieth century's sense of Swift's greatness. Williams died at his home, 43 Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, on 24 October 1964.<br>
