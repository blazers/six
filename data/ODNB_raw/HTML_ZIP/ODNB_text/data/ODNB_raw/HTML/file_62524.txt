<span class="headword">Seznec,  Jean Joseph</span>  (1905&#150;1983), <span class="occ">art historian and scholar of French literature</span>, was born on 18 March 1905 at Morlaix, Brittany, the son of Jean Seznec and his wife Pauline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> le F&eacute;rec, both primary school teachers, although originally of farming stock. His mother died giving birth to a younger brother and he was brought up mainly by a grandmother. He valued his Breton origins, retaining a connection with the province through academic work on Chateaubriand and Renan, and lifelong friendship with the judge and painter Pierre Cavellat, some of whose works are held at All Souls College, Oxford, to which Seznec was attached for over thirty years.<br>
<br>The young Seznec aspired to be a painter but intellectual promise led him, from the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> at Rennes, to the Lyc&eacute;e Henri IV in Paris, and on to the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, then headed by the illustrious literary scholar Gustave Lanson. Seznec was a contemporary of Jean-Paul Sartre and gained the <i>agr&eacute;gation</i> in 1928. Two years at the French School in Rome, where he encountered the scholar of medieval French iconography &Eacute;mile M&acirc;le, furnished a decisive opportunity to combine his passion for art with the skills of literary analysis nurtured by Lanson. In the course of two years teaching literature at Cambridge (1931&#150;3) and one at the Lyc&eacute;e Thiers in Marseilles (1933&#150;4), Seznec published his first articles on early modern art and mythology in the journal <span class="italic">M&eacute;langes d'Histoire et d'Arch&eacute;ologie</span> and made initial contact with Fritz Saxl, who was to be the first director of the Warburg Institute when it moved to London in 1933. During five years at the French Institute in Florence (1934&#150;9) Seznec wrote <span class="italic">La survivance des dieux antiques</span>, a brilliant and original account of the continuous survival of the pagan gods in European literature, philosophy, sculpture, and painting from the early middle ages to the late Renaissance. Imbued with the spirit of Warburg, Panofsky, and Saxl, but more wide-ranging, geographically and culturally, than was typical of their work, Seznec's book earned him his Sorbonne doctorate and was published in London by the Warburg Institute in 1940 (although only circulated in 1946). Alongside his edition of Diderot's <span class="italic">Salons</span>, <span class="italic">La survivance</span> was to remain Seznec's magnum opus, and was translated into English (as <span class="italic">The Survival of the Pagan Gods</span>) in 1953, into Japanese in 1975, into Spanish in 1983, and reissued, to renewed acclaim, in a revised French edition in 1980, through the enthusiastic offices of the poet and critic Yves Bonnefoy.<br>
<br>Mobilized in 1940, Seznec served in the Chasseurs Alpins, and after the armistice went to the United States, where in 1941 he obtained a post at Harvard and rose rapidly through the academic ranks. In 1946 he became a full professor and in 1949 was appointed chairman of the department of romance languages, but then gladly accepted an invitation, masterminded by Maurice Bowra and John Sparrow, to apply for the Marshal Foch professorship of French literature at Oxford, held at All Souls, in succession to Lanson's disciple Gustave Rudler. He was duly elected in 1950. A first marriage, which had produced a son, Alain, who became a professor and then librarian at Cornell University, had ended when, in 1946, in New England, Seznec met Simone Louise Lee, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pailley (1899&#150;1992), the French daughter of a professor, and widow of Guy Hunter Lee, landscape architect. They were married in 1954.<br>
<br>Freed from major administrative duties, Seznec revelled in the academic and collegiate life of Oxford. He was devoted to All Souls, where his elegance, wit, and erudition were much appreciated, as were the regular research seminars he organized. He lectured extensively for the faculty of medieval and modern languages, taking as his central focus the enduring presence of classical mythology and literature in the art and literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly supervised postgraduates in these areas. His many articles included studies of Diderot, Flaubert, Renan, Michelet, and Proust, to whom he devoted an outstanding Zaharoff lecture in 1982, entitled characteristically &#145;Marcel Proust et les dieux&#146;. Having helped to secure the appointment of the Warburgian Edgar Wind as the first professor of art history at Oxford in 1955, he strongly supported art scholarship in the university, regularly lecturing at the Ashmolean Museum. In Oxford he also embarked, initially with Jean Adh&eacute;mar, on his edition of Denis Diderot's reviews of the biennial Paris <span class="italic">Salon</span>, exhibiting remarkable skills of connoisseurship in tracking down the works Diderot had commented on. The four volumes of Diderot's <span class="italic">Salons</span> published by the Clarendon Press between 1957 and 1966 constituted a monumental work of imaginative erudition.<br>
<br>After his retirement from the Foch chair in 1972 Seznec remained in Oxford as an emeritus fellow of All Souls and pursued his work on Diderot, preparing the bulk of a second edition of <span class="italic">Salons</span>, and embarking on studies of Egypt in nineteenth-century French art and painting. He received many honours: elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1960, he was also made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and a commander of the Ordre national du m&eacute;rite, and was awarded the prix du rayonnement fran&ccedil;ais by the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise. He was a visiting professor at seventeen different universities and received honorary doctorates from Harvard and St Andrews. Having lived latterly at 1 Steady's Lane, Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, he died on 21 November 1983 in the War Memorial Hospital, Chipping Norton, of bronchopneumonia and cerebral arteriosclerosis.<br>
