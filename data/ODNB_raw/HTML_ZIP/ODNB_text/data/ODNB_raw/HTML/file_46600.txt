<span class="headword">Barratt,  Thomas James</span>  (1841&#150;1914), <span class="occ">soap manufacturer and pioneer of advertising</span>, was born on 16 May 1841 at 25 Tottenham Place, St Pancras, London, the son of Thomas Barratt, a piano maker, and his wife, Emma Price. He was educated at a private day school, and at fifteen was apprenticed to a firm of London merchants, George and Frederick Evans. Merchant enterprise seems to have been in his nature, and through hard work and natural inclination he moved upward in another London establishment, Ellis and Hale, colonial brokers. In 1864 he joined the newly enlarged soap-making establishment of A. and F. Pears in Great Russell Street as a bookkeeper, shortly becoming a commercial traveller for the firm. Barratt's skill and dedication to the work were enhanced by a family connection with his marriage on 11 March 1865 to Mary Frances (<i>d</i>. 1916), eldest daughter of Francis Pears, after which he joined Francis and Andrew Pears as partner in the firm.<br>
<br>Leaving the soapworks to be overseen by his partners, Barratt began what would be his life's work: to expand the firm through increased advertising. The questionable value of advertising, along with its reputation of being the last resort of failures and frauds, made Barratt's task a difficult one. Francis Pears, uncertain of Barratt's vision and apparently unwilling to be a party to this endeavour, withdrew from the firm in 1875 leaving &pound;4000 in capital. His son Andrew continued to manage the soapworks while Barratt handled advertising.<br>
<br>Barratt was an innovator, both in his use of advertising and his methods, as well as a great promoter of the advertising profession. By placing the name Pears repeatedly in a column of newspaper space, or filling several columns with a single PEARS spelt out in hundreds of iterations of the name in minute type, he contrived to get round newspaper restrictions against illustrated advertisements. Celebrity endorsements and comic, even self-parodying, advertisements became trade marks of Pears advertising. Regular daily advertising in the national and regional press made Pears one of the most recognized names in the English-speaking world, making, as Barratt claimed, as many as 2000 appearances before the average reader. Such was the coverage that W. E. Gladstone, speaking in the House of Commons, made a passing reference to amendments &#145;as thick as the leaves in Vallombrosa or as plentiful as the advertisements of Pears soap&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 189). Barratt continued personally to buy all the firm's advertising space until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Barratt was renowned in addition for his use of &#145;stunt&#146; advertising. He imported 10 centime coins, accepted as pennies in England, which he had stamped &#145;Pears&#146; and put into circulation at fourteen for the shilling. Buying works of art and then offering high-quality reproductions at a nominal price, Barratt created the <span class="roman">Pears' Pictures for People</span> plan which brought the name Pears into millions of homes. The most famous of these was the portrait of a child by Sir John Everett Millais, distributed by Barratt under the title <span class="italic">Bubbles</span>, which generated as much debate about the commercial use of art as it did simple enjoyment.<br>
<br>Under Barratt's hand the firm expanded, and Pears' soap became one of the most recognized products of the late nineteenth century. In 1892 A. and F. Pears became a public company with &pound;810,000 in assets, continuing to pay a healthy 10 per cent dividend during Barratt's stewardship. Advertising expenditure, which had never exceeded &pound;80 annually when Barratt joined the firm, stood at over &pound;100,000 at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Barratt brought the same energy to his other interests that he brought to advertising. As a proponent of conservation, Barratt started a programme to buy open lands for preservation against development, a scheme which he urged others to emulate. He was also a historian, completing a multi-volume history of Hampstead. Notwithstanding the controversial commercial use of art in Pears' advertising, Barratt filled his estate, Bellmoor, with a substantial collection of British art. He was also passionately interested in microscopy, and was a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society.<br>
<br>Barratt died at Queen's Highcliffe Hotel, Margate, on 26 April 1914 after a short illness, and was buried on 30 April at St Pancras cemetery, East Finchley. At some point Barratt had separated from his wife, and the principal beneficiaries of his estate were his two sons from a relationship with Florence Bell, daughter of a doctor, who lived with him and called herself Mrs Barratt. His collection of Nelson memorabilia, including a considerable amount of plate, was given to the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe, described Barratt as &#145;the father of Modern Advertising from whom I have learned so much&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 190), and he was popularly described as &#145;the man who washed the face of the world&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
