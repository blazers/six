<span class="headword">Clark,  Alexander, of Balbirnie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1591), <span class="occ">merchant and provost of Edinburgh</span>, is of unknown origins. He was in the service of and related by marriage to Henry Balnaves, a former royal secretary who was imprisoned for his protestant views in 1543. Clark formed an apparently irregular union with Agnes Scheves of Kemback, whose sister Christian was Balnaves's wife, and maintained a connection with Balnaves until the latter's death in 1579, when Clark was still keeping his accounts. In May 1546 both men were among the castilians who seized St Andrews Castle and murdered Cardinal David Beaton. Clark was captured at the end of the siege, in July 1547, and in company with John Knox was consigned to the galleys. He accompanied Knox to England after their release in February 1549. On 7 April both received rewards from the English privy council. Clark next appeared in Scotland on 20 February 1553, when he received a respite from Governor Arran for his treasonable activities in St Andrews in 1546&#150;7. His activities in the interim are unknown, but it is possible that while in England he met other exiled Scottish dissidents, including William Harlaw, John Spottiswoode, and John Willock.<br>
<br>By 1554 Clark was in France, where he appeared in the lists of the Scots archers in the service of Henri II. He did not return to Scotland with Balnaves in 1556, and in 1559 was promoted to the king's personal bodyguard, the Scots guard. He may have had indirect connections with the company of &#145;young&#146; Arran, son of the duke of Ch&acirc;telherault, who fled home in the summer of 1559. By 1560 Clark was an informant for Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, English ambassador in France. He was reported as a &#145;principal doer&#146; in recent religious &#145;stirs&#146;, presumably the conspiracy of Amboise of that year  (Hardwicke, 1.155). He may also have been Knox's source for events at the French court at this period. The precise date of his return to Scotland is unknown. On his return he enjoyed the confidence both of English diplomats and of Lord Seton, Queen Mary's Roman Catholic, pro-French envoy, who arrived in Scotland in the autumn of 1560. Clark was regarded by the English as a useful mediator between Arran and Lord James Stewart, and from at least early 1561 his contacts reached as high as Sir William Cecil, principal secretary to Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>In February 1561 Clark was granted a divorce from Agnes Scheves by the kirk session of St Andrews. His second wife was Margaret Boyle and he purchased for himself and Margaret the estate of Balbirnie in Fife in 1565. In March 1561 he acted as an agent for Arran; though he refused to go to France to establish contact with the king of Navarre, he did undertake a mission to see Cecil. It was, as a client of James Stewart, earl of Moray, however, that Clark's career prospered after 1560. From 1561 to 1564 he acted as collector of the thirds of benefices. On 10 April 1564 he agreed to a contract, registered in the records of the burgh of Edinburgh, with Robert Lekpreuik, official printer to the general assembly, for an edition of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Order</span>, drawn up by English exiled ministers in Geneva in 1558, together with the metrical <span class="roman">Psalms</span> of David. The arrangements demonstrate Clark's French contacts: Clark supplied paper from France and allowed Lekpreuik to purchase new printing irons in roman and music types, also probably from France, superseding his old, cruder black-letter type. Clark would hold the stock, releasing it in batches of a hundred, until the edition sold out.<br>
<br>In January 1565 Clark was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh <i>gratis</i>, at Moray's request, an unusual concession to anyone other than the monarch. Remarkably, he was immediately co-opted onto the town council. His links with the English agent Thomas Randolph were those of confidant and financier as well as informer. His account of the Palm Sunday riot of 1565 is remarkably frank about protestant violence and to be contrasted with Knox's censored version. And Clark, who claimed to be Randolph's &#145;treasurer&#146;, also enjoyed the exchange of ribald gossip about the court and the Englishman's fruitless pursuit of Mary Beaton, one of the queen's ladies of the royal household.<br>
<br>Along with the town clerk, Alexander Guthrie, Clark was one of the four captains of armed bands of Edinburgh protestants discovered secretly mustering on the crags, close to the royal palace of Holyroodhouse, in July 1565, shortly before the abortive conspiracy planned by Moray against Queen Mary. Among those who stood as sureties for his appearance in court were two leading protestants, Patrick, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, and Robert Campbell of Kinzeancleuch, long-time friend of Knox. Like both Guthrie and Lindsay of the Byres, Clark was also involved in the events of 9 March 1566, when both the queen's servant David Riccio and her Dominican confessor John Black were murdered. A strong streak of pragmatism, demonstrated in his later career, first became evident when his rehabilitation after the Riccio murder was completed by his appearance on a leet (a list of designated candidates) for Edinburgh's town council, drawn up by Queen Mary in October 1566. A month earlier, the queen had officially asked for a passport for him through England to France; during this trip he acted as an envoy between Moray and both Cecil and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Despite being a Marian nominee Clark survived the queen's fall, remaining on Edinburgh's council throughout the period from 1566 until late 1570, which included Moray's regency. He also represented the burgh at the convention held at Perth in July 1569. Clark profited in various ways from his links with Moray during his regency. Along with William Birnie, a leading Edinburgh merchant, he was granted a licence in February 1568 to strip the lead from Elgin Cathedral, but their loot was intercepted by the fifth earl of Huntly. In February 1569 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the regent to raise a force to subdue Huntly and the other queen's men in the north. His business activities, like those of Birnie's widow, Helen Acheson, and her new husband, Archibald Stewart, were caught up in the civil war, their goods in France being seized through the intervention of a Marian agent, Sebastien Danelour. Although nominally a supporter of the king's men, Clark, like Stewart, lobbied both parties and their connections in England and France for restitution. In September 1569 both men were recommended to Mary, imprisoned at Tutbury by William Maitland of Lethington, even thoughMaitland acknowledged that Clark had previously been an adversary. Along with Stewart he lent money to William Kirkcaldy of Grange, leader of the queen's men under siege in Edinburgh Castle from 1570 to 1573, in return for holding some of the royal jewels as security. In June 1573, the trio of Clark, Acheson, and Stewart were called before the privy council to deliver up the jewels. After that, the business partners went their separate ways politically.<br>
<br>Ever a survivor, even if one who occasionally wrestled with his conscience, Clark rose continuously throughout the complex, troubled years between 1578 and 1584 to become provost of Edinburgh; he first achieved office by means of a leet which Regent Morton tried to impose on the capital. Despite his close links with Morton, Clark survived his fall in 1580 by joining in the clamour for his execution. Notwithstanding his protestations of loyalty to the &#145;amity&#146; with England, he was criticized by both English agents and his old radical protestant friends for being &#145;too pliable&#146; to the royal court during the period of the rise of Esm&eacute; Stewart, who became duke of Lennox in 1581. Clark was also vilified by Andrew Melville for failing to support the outspoken Edinburgh minister, John Durie, exiled from the burgh in May 1582 for his criticism of Lennox from the pulpit. Despite having survived as provost during the period of the Ruthven regime in 1582&#150;3, he was nominated provost again by the royalist administration of the earl of Arran in September 1583. But in the crisis which followed the Black Acts Parliament of May 1584 and the flight of Edinburgh's radical ministers, Clark regained his conscience: when confronted with a royal letter condemning the exiles, he refused to subscribe to it. His political career petered out after this crisis, though he served one more year on the borough council (1584&#150;5).<br>
<br>Clark died in 1591, leaving a net estate of &pound;3111 Scots and was buried in Edinburgh in Greyfriars churchyard. In the 1560s he had been one of the capital's wealthiest forty merchants. His chequered career is testimony to the acerbic comment of David Calderwood that the prime interest of Edinburgh lay in its &#145;particular&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.177&#150;8). An early protestant figure of impeccable pedigree and impressive connections, as well as a long-standing example of the &#145;better sort&#146; who served the English interest, Clark was above all a pragmatist.<br>
