<span class="headword">Overton,  Constantine <span class="st"> [Constant]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>1626/7, <em>d.</em> in or after 1695), <span class="occ">Quaker activist</span>, was the son of Rowland Overton of Shrewsbury, carpenter. When his father became a freeman of Shrewsbury in 1639 Constantine was twelve, the youngest of four children: two sisters, Katherine and Eleanor, and a brother, Humphrey, three years his senior. Constantine became a shoemaker and was admitted freeman of Shrewsbury in 1653; a trade-token which he issued ten years later bore the arms of his occupation. The hearth tax roll of 1672 records him as living in Welsh Ward within the Walls, paying on four hearths. He married twice. His first wife, Jane, the mother of Samuel, who was baptized in January 1651, died the following year and was buried in St Chad's, Shrewsbury, on 20 November 1652. With his second wife, also called Jane, he had two daughters, Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1654) and Jane, born on 14 September 1656.<br>
<br>Constantine Overton was one of the first to join the Quaker movement in Shropshire, and he frequently appears as a witness to marriages in the Shrewsbury Quaker marriages from the very first entry in August 1656. In April 1657, while in Shrewsbury gaol, his name heads the list of those Quakers whose names were attached to <span class="italic">The Priest's Wickednesse and Cruelty, Laid Open, and Made Manifest</span>, which describes how he and other Quakers were attacked by people from the church in neighbouring Cressedge. The Quakers were later sent to gaol, fined for keeping their hats on in court, and imprisoned for a further three months.<br>
<br>Overton was to suffer further in the Quaker cause following the Restoration. In 1662 he and his brother, Humphrey, were imprisoned for non-payment of tithes. On 26 February 1663 Constantine was seized at a meeting at Shrewsbury and sent to prison; and on 24 March 1663 he was disfranchised as freeman of Shrewsbury for refusing to take the proffered oaths and for holding meetings in his house. He suffered further when he, Humphrey, and their two servants were committed to gaol for keeping their shops open on Christmas day. In May 1670 the mayor and local officers took down the names of all those present at a Quaker meeting, sending four to prison and fining the rest&#151;Constantine, Humphrey, and Thomas Overton (whose exact relationship to the brothers is uncertain) being the heaviest sufferers. Constantine was heavily fined again, and he was to incur additional loss for the offence of keeping his shop open on Christmas day.<br>
<br>It would seem probable that Constantine Overton was an important Friend in his locality, for the minutes of the London yearly meeting for 1672 list Constant Overton as the recipient of five books for the county of Shropshire. There is no record of the date of his death or burial: he is last known to have been alive in 1695 when he was recorded as living in the Stone ward, Shrewsbury (Shrops. RRC, 3365/275, Marriage Duty Act returns).<br>
