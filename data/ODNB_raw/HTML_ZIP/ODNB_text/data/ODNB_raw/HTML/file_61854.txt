<span class="headword">Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Henslow]</span>,  Cecilia Maria</span>  (1767&#150;1859), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 1 September 1767, the daughter of the French-born violinist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1575/', "Fran&#231;ois Hippolyte Barth&#233;l&#233;mon (1741&#150;1808)")</script>; her mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61855/', "Mary (Polly) Young (1749&#150;1799)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69663/', "Young family (per. c.1700&#150;1799)")</script>], &#145;also &hellip; a musician of no mean capacity&#146;  (Higham), was from a celebrated musical family, and a niece of Cecilia Arne, wife of Thomas. Cecilia Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon accompanied her parents on their continental tour in 1776&#150;7; she sang before King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Queen Marie-Antoinette of France. Her London d&eacute;but may have been her performance at a benefit concert for her mother on 30 March 1778. On 3 March 1779 she appeared at the Haymarket, singing a duet with her mother. She was taught by the leading pianist J. S. Schroeter and became &#145;not only a good organist and pianist but also a composer&#146;  (Landon, 168&#150;9). During the 1780s the &#145;procession of new pianists&#146; appearing on the London concert stage included Miss Parke, Miss Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon, and Miss Reynolds, &#145;none of whom, at their d&eacute;buts, would admit to more than fourteen years&#146;  (Plantinga, 118). Her talents as a keyboard virtuoso are attested to by her performance at a benefit concert for her father on 8 May 1783, when she played a &#145;Lesson [i.e. sonata] on the Piano Forte&#146; by Clementi. She was listed in 1794 in Doane's <span class="italic">Musical Directory</span> as a resident of Kennington Lane (her parents' address was given as 8 Kennington Place) and as a soprano (singing at the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens) and harpist. She took part in a charity concert at Brighton in August 1795 with her parents. Her performing career apparently ceased with her marriage to a captain in the 15th King's light dragoons, Edward Prentis (or Prentice; not W. H., as in some reference works) Henslow (<i>bap</i>. 1772, <i>d</i>. 1857), later spelt Henslowe, at St Mary, Lambeth, on 12 January 1797; they had a daughter, Fanny, and several sons. In 1791 she received a substantial inheritance from an aunt; this was not Mrs Arne as claimed by Ehrlich, but Isabella Scott [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/65900">Young,  Isabella</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/69663">Young family</a>]. She produced four publications of instrumental music between 1791 and 1795, and a vocal piece, <span class="italic">The Capture of the Cape of Good Hope</span>, for soprano and piano or harpsichord (1795). The 300 or so subscribers to her op. 1, dedicated &#145;by Permission&#146; to Princess Sophia Matilda, included members of high society, as well as leading musicians. Her op. 2 was dedicated to Frederica, duchess of York. Her music, right from the start of her op. 1 no. 1, is confident, well paced, structurally assured, and stylistically accomplished.<br>
<br>During the 1790s, when Joseph Haydn visited England, he spent much time with the Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon family &#145;at their retreat at Vauxhall&#146; and &#145;gave music lessons to the daughter of the house&#146;  (Higham, 11). Cecilia dedicated her sonata op. 3 (1794) for piano or harpsichord to Haydn, and included in it effects reminiscent of his musical wit; she preserved relics including signed copies of his music, and wrote down her memories of her &#145;caro Maestro Haydn&#146;, with whom she often sat &#145;when he play'd&#146;  (Landon, 169); and she was a subscriber (as &#145;Mrs Ed. Henslow&#146;) to <span class="italic">The Creation</span> (1798). She is the source of the story of Haydn's replying, when she asked him &#145;Papa Haydn, Why do you cry?&#146;, &#145;Oh! <i>my dear Child</i>. I do not like to leave my English Friends, they are so kind to me&#146;  (ibid.). Her reminiscences also convey her affection for her &#145;Dear Father&#146; and &#145;beloved mother&#146;. She published a brief memoir of her father in 1827, prefaced to a selection from his oratorio <span class="italic">Jefte in Masfa</span>. Her third son, the Revd William Henry Henslow, said in <span class="italic">The Phonarthon</span>, published in 1840, that his mother, who had told him that their ancestor Anthony Young composed the music for &#145;God Save the King&#146;, was &#145;now living&#146;. She died at Tottenhill, Norfolk, on 5 December 1859, of &#145;natural decay&#146;  (d. cert.). She has also been referred to as &#145;Mrs Hinchliffe&#146; on the basis of a note on a manuscript copy of a Haydn aria, but this is probably a mistranscription of Henslow.<br>
