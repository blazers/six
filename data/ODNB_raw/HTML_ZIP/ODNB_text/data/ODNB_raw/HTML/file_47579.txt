<span class="headword">Miller, Sir  Francis  Norie-</span>, first baronet  (1859&#150;1947), <span class="occ">insurance company manager</span>, was born on 11 March 1859 at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, the son of Henry Miller, chief of the statistical department, HM customs, and his wife, Ann Alexander Norie, who was of Scottish birth. He was educated privately and trained for the law, but instead began his insurance career in the London office of London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company. In 1880 he joined Ocean Accident and Guarantee, and in 1882 he became chief clerk in the accident and guarantee department of Employers' Liability Assurance. On 16 January 1884 Norie-Miller married Grace Harvey Day, daughter of the Revd H. J. Day, vicar of Cheshunt. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1885 he became assistant secretary of Mercantile Accident and Guarantee of Glasgow. In February 1887, aged only twenty-seven, he was appointed secretary of General Accident and Employers' Liability Assurance Association of Perth, recently founded by a group of local businessmen and landowners. He remained with the company for the rest of his career, as manager from 1891, as a board member from 1918, as managing director (1933&#150;9), as chairman (1933&#150;44), and as honorary governor from 1938 until his death.<br>
<br>When Norie-Miller joined General Accident, accident insurance was still in its infancy. His achievement was to develop his company into one of Britain's greatest composite insurers. Beginning from a two-room office in Perth, he swept out all but one of the old officials, cancelled doubtful risks, and, travelling throughout the country, appointed 800 new agents in his first year. With great energy and determination, he was alert to new market opportunities, demonstrating competitive panache in underwriting new forms of insurance, diversifying across all markets, discounting premium rates, and cross-subsidizing one branch of business by profits made in another.<br>
<br>In 1887 Norie-Miller introduced coupon insurance by providing free cover against injury from railway accidents for anyone carrying a particular publisher's diary. Burglary, fire, and motor insurance were commenced in the 1890s. No-claims bonuses were pioneered as a competitive device, and in the 1920s a hugely successful scheme was introduced whereby a year's free motor insurance was offered with every new Morris sold. By the 1930s General Accident had become Britain's largest corporate motor insurer. In 1899 business was commenced in the United States. By 1914 a worldwide network of offices had been established. Norie-Miller was also the driving force behind this organization. He crossed the Atlantic eight times during the First World War, and by 1935 he had made thirty-nine business trips to the United States alone.<br>
<br>A prominent figure in the civic life of Perth, Norie-Miller served as a magistrate for forty-seven years. He was a director of Perth Royal Infirmary for thirty-two years, and chairman for over twenty-one years of Perth school board and the county education authority. In 1907 he was made an honorary fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland. He was a regular worshipper at St Ninian's Cathedral, Perth. He was awarded the M&eacute;daille du Roi Albert by the king of the Belgians for his work for Belgian refugees during the 1914&#150;18 war. In 1933 he became a freeman of the city of Perth. At a by-election in 1935 he was elected member for Perth, after a joint invitation to stand from the local Liberal and Conservative parties, but he did not contest the subsequent general election that year. In 1936 he was created a baronet in recognition of his services to Perth.<br>
<br>Norie-Miller's elder son, Claud, was killed on active service in the Mediterranean in 1917. The younger son, Stanley, succeeded his father as general manager of General Accident in 1933. Grace died in 1931, and in 1934 Norie-Miller married his secretary, Florence Jean Belfrage McKim. He enjoyed the countryside, shooting, fishing, golf, and poetry. He died at his home at Cleeve, Cherrybank, near Perth, on 4 July 1947, aged eighty-eight, and was buried at St Ninian's. He was survived by his second wife. His son Stanley succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
