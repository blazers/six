<span class="headword">Blackadder,  William</span>  (1647&#150;1696), <span class="occ">physician and plotter</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2502/', "John Blackadder the elder (1615/1623?&#150;1686)")</script>, and his wife, Janet Haining (<i>d</i>. 1688); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2501/', "Adam Blackadder (b. 1659, d. in or after 1696)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2503/', "John Blackadder (1664&#150;1729)")</script> were among his brothers. Admitted to Edinburgh University in 1665, he graduated in 1668. In 1674 he secured the release of one of his brothers, who had been imprisoned by the provost of Stirling for not taking the prescribed oaths and for attending conventicles. On 14 July 1675 he was apprenticed to Patrick Hepburn, an apothecary in Edinburgh. Blackadder then studied medicine at Leiden, where he graduated MD on 24 August 1680. While in the United Provinces he made the acquaintance of many Scottish exiles, aided perhaps by his father's reputation as a presbyterian divine.<br>
<br>In 1685 Blackadder joined the earl of Argyll's expedition to Scotland. On 6 May, with three ships anchored off Orkney, he was sent ashore with Argyll's secretary, William Spence, in order to find a pilot and to gather intelligence. He was captured in Kirkwall and ordered to be taken to Edinburgh for examination by the privy council. On 6 June he landed at Leith and managed to signal to his sister to destroy any incriminating evidence in his lodgings. He remained in prison for over a year, until he was able to write to Pensionary Fagel in the United Provinces, a former patient, who sent for James II's envoy and asked him to release Blackadder as a naturalized Dutchman.<br>
<br>In 1688 Blackadder was sent by the prince of Orange into Edinburgh, but he was arrested by the governor and sent for trial. He was freed following the revolution and on 3 January 1690 was appointed physician to the army in Scotland. He was also appointed a physician in ordinary to William III. He seems to have spent most of his time in Edinburgh. On 6 February 1691 he married Marion (<i>b</i>. after 1660, <i>d</i>. in or after 1698), eldest legitimate daughter of James Hunter of Muirhouse, advocate. By order of Edinburgh council on 29 September 1693 he was named a burgess of the city, reference being made to his apprenticeship under Sir Patrick Hepburn. Blackadder was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1695, but he died the following year; he was buried on 27 October 1696 in Greyfriars, Edinburgh. His wife survived him and married William Walkinshaw on 14 September 1698.<br>
