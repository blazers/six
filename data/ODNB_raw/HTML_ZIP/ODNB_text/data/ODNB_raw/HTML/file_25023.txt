<span class="headword">Seebohm,  Henry</span>  (1832&#150;1895), <span class="occ">ornithologist</span>, was born on 12 July 1832 at Horton Grange, Bradford, the eldest of four children of Benjamin Seebohm (1798&#150;1871), a wool merchant from near Bad Pyrmont in Germany, and his wife, Esther Wheeler (1798&#150;1864), of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, a granddaughter of William Tuke and a niece of Sarah Hustler. On marrying, his parents settled on a small farm, Horton Grange, near Bradford, where they remained for several years before moving to Bradford. Seebohm's siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36005/', "Frederic Seebohm (1833&#150;1912)")</script>, the historian, and Julia Eliza Seebohm (<i>d</i>. 1863), who married the cocoa manufacturer, Joseph Rowntree (1836&#150;1925).<br>
<br>Both Seebohm's parents were active in the Society of Friends, and he was educated at the Friends' school, in York, where he developed a taste for natural history. His father started him early in life as a grocer's shop boy, but ultimately Seebohm settled at Sheffield where he became a manufacturer of steel. On 19 January 1859 he married Maria (<i>b</i>. 1839/40), daughter of George John Healey, merchant, of Moss Side, Manchester.<br>
<br>Seebohm's spare time was devoted to natural history, especially ornithology, and he made a number of journeys to the Netherlands, Greece, Asia Minor, Scandinavia, Germany, and Siberia to collect and study birds in their native haunts. One of his most successful expeditions was in 1875 to the lower Pechora River valley in Russia, with the zoologist John Alexander Harvie-Brown, when the eggs of the grey plover and of many rare species of birds were obtained. The account of this voyage, as well as that to Heligoland, where he went to study bird migration at the house of the ornithologist Heinrich G&auml;tke, was given in his <span class="italic">Siberia in Europe</span> (1880). In 1877 Seebohm accompanied the Arctic explorer and merchant navy officer Joseph Wiggins (1832&#150;1905) on a journey to Siberia. They travelled along the Yenisey River, where they made further important ornithological discoveries, recorded in Seebohm's <span class="italic">Siberia in Asia</span> (1882). On that voyage, Wiggins's ship was wrecked shortly after reaching the Kureyka, a tributary of the Yenisey. Later Seebohm visited southern Europe and South Africa to study European birds in their winter quarters, and to collect materials for <span class="italic">The Geographical Distribution of the Family Charadriid&aelig;</span> (1887).<br>
<br>Seebohm was also author of several other works, including <span class="italic">Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, vol. 5, Turdid&aelig;</span> (1881), <span class="italic">A History of British Birds with Coloured Illustrations of their Eggs</span> (1882&#150;5), <span class="italic">Classification of Birds</span> (1890), to which a supplement was issued in 1895, <span class="italic">The Birds of the Japanese Empire</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Geographical Distribution of British Birds</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">Address to the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union</span> (1893). He also contributed upwards of eighty papers, chiefly on ornithological subjects, between 1877 and 1895, to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, <span class="italic">Ibis</span>, and other scientific publications. He left unfinished <span class="italic">The Eggs of British Birds</span> and <span class="italic">Thrushes</span>. His two Siberian expedition narratives were published together as <span class="italic">The Birds of Siberia</span> in 1901.<br>
<br>Seebohm joined the British Ornithologists' Union and the Zoological Society in 1873; he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1878, and was one of the secretaries from June 1890 until his death. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in December 1879. He was also a liberal contributor of ornithological specimens to the British Museum. He gave the museum his impressive collection of eggs, and compiled the fifth volume of the bird catalogue, published by the trustees in 1881.<br>
<br>In later years Seebohm resided at South Kensington, London, and Maidenhead, Berkshire. He died on 26 November 1895, following an attack of influenza, at his home, 22 Courtfield Gardens, South Kensington. He was survived by his wife but predeceased by his only son, Ted, who died in New York in unexplained circumstances in 1888. Seebohm's extensive ornithological collections of more than 16,000 bird skins and 235 skeletons were presented to the British Museum (Natural History).<br>
