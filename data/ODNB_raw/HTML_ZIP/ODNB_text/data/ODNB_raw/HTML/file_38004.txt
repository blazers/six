<span class="headword">Stanton,  William</span>  (1639&#150;1705), <span class="occ">tomb sculptor and mason</span>, was born on 6 April 1639, the son of Edward Stanton (1595/6&#150;1686) and nephew of the mason&#150;sculptor Thomas Stanton (1609/10&#150;1674). Thomas Stanton had, by 1635, established the business which members of the family were to control for a century from a house and yard on the west side of Shoe Lane, in the City of London, adjoining the churchyard of St Andrew's, Holborn. A prolific tomb-maker, Thomas was master of the Masons' Company in 1660&#150;61.<br>
<br>William Stanton was apprenticed to Thomas and became free of the Masons' Company in 1663. Church monuments signed by him are known from 1665. He took the first of twenty-four apprentices in 1666, the year of the baptism of the first of nine recorded children he had with his wife, Dorothy (1639/40&#150;1707). After Thomas's death in 1674 William took sole charge of the yard; in 1678 he was employing nine assistants.<br>
<br>During much of his career Stanton was probably the most prolific tomb-maker to the gentry and aristocracy of England and Wales, producing monuments and grave slabs placed inside churches and a smaller number of churchyard monuments. About 100 memorials of these various kinds are authenticated as having been supplied by him, but it is clear that they represent only a small proportion of his total output, because many more can be assigned on stylistic grounds. Memorials were made in the Holborn yard and transported unassembled by land or water. Their distribution was centred on London but extended to distant and remote locations.<br>
<br>Stanton's monuments claim for him an important place in the history of English sculpture. His skill in handling architectural forms stands out, as does the excellence of his best figures. He employed a very wide range of monument types, but the established pattern consisting of a framed inscription flanked by two columns and surmounted by a pediment is that to which he turned most frequently, developing it in rich and varied ways. His earliest effigial memorials are derivative, but in the later 1670s he perfected a distinctive figure style, marked by dignity imparted by careful attention to repose and counterpoise. His masterpiece is the monument to Sir John Poley at Holy Trinity Church, Boxted, Suffolk (<i>c</i>.1680?), by virtue of the quality of the standing figure of alabaster and the exceptional interactive unity of the whole work. It was followed by several important marble figures, culminating in the noble semi-reclining effigy of Thomas, first earl of Coventry (<i>d</i>. 1699), at St Mary's, Elmley Castle, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>In the Victoria and Albert Museum survive twenty-one drawings by William for monuments and a small terracotta model (which provides valuable evidence of his working procedures) for the effigy of Lady Atkins (1691) in St Paul's, Clapham. Stanton carried out extensive masonry work at Gray's Inn from about 1672, and many of his tomb commissions evidently resulted from inns of court contacts. Jointly with Edward Pearce he took the principal contract for the rebuilding of St Andrew's, Holborn, in 1684. He was the mason for the building of Belton House, Lincolnshire (1685&#150;8), and Denham Place, Buckinghamshire (1689&#150;94). Stanton was master of the Masons' Company in 1688 and 1689&#150;90. He died on 30 May 1705 and was buried two days later at St Andrew's, Holborn.<br>

<a name="cosubject_74674"></a><span class="headword">Edward Stanton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1681&#150;1734), <span class="occ">sculptor and mason</span>, William's ninth recorded child, was apprenticed to his father in 1694 and became free of the Masons' Company in 1702. He played a significant role in the family business before William's death and took control subsequently. Edward Stanton's style is in evidence in memorials, of which extensive production continued, and his effigies are of high sculptural quality. A notable example is that of Sir Francis Russell, bt (<i>d</i>. 1706), at Strensham, Worcestershire.<br>
<br>Stanton was appointed mason to the City of London in 1708 and was the sculptor of the statue of George I which was set up at the Royal Exchange in 1718 (now lost). He expanded the masonry side of the business, for example by undertaking very extensive work at Westminster Abbey, and thereby became considerably more wealthy than his father. From about 1720 he worked in partnership with Christopher Horsnaile the elder. Edward Stanton was master of the Masons' Company in 1719&#150;20. He was a captain in the City of London trained bands. He was thrice married. A year after the death of his first wife, Sarah Fulkes (1678&#150;1717), he married Lucy Child, and, following her demise in 1730, Jane Churchill. Stanton was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 30 May 1734.<br>
