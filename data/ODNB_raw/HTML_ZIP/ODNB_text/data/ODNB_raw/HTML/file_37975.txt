<span class="headword">Smith,  Abel</span>  (1717?&#150;1788), <span class="occ">banker and merchant</span>, was baptized on 14 March 1717, the third son of Abel Smith (<i>d</i>. 1757) and his wife, Jane, daughter of George Beaumont of Chapelthorpe, Yorkshire. His grandfather Thomas Smith had added to a local mercer's business in Nottingham some banking activities, including remittances for the excise. This banking activity was considerably expanded by the elder Abel Smith and his brothers, but Abel's eldest son, Sir George Smith, baronet, used his inheritance to become a country gentleman. The younger Abel was placed at fifteen as an apprentice in a Hull merchant firm trading to the Baltic. At the conclusion of his apprenticeship he became a partner in this firm, thereafter Wilberforce and Smith. In 1745 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Bird of Barton on the Heath, Warwickshire, a wealthy silk manufacturer; her sister Elizabeth was to marry his partner Robert Wilberforce, establishing close family ties between the Nottingham and Hull families.<br>
<br>Abel Smith also became a partner in his family's bank in Nottingham, whose management he took over on his father's death in 1757. The firm's expanded volume of government and other remittances made close London connections indispensable. To gain them, in 1758 Smith entered into a partnership with John Payne, a London linen draper, to form the bank of Smith and Payne with offices in London and Nottingham. Smith was already well connected in London through cousins and through his elder brother John, a London merchant and director of both the East India and the South Sea companies. As John Payne was then chairman of the East India Company and his brother Edward a director of the Bank of England, Smith and Payne, almost from its inception, was a prestigious house that could attract the correspondence of country banks and desirable town and country business. (The Paynes' connections were also to prove useful in obtaining for Smith and Payne extraordinary re-discount facilities at the Bank of England.) Smith led in creating additional affiliated banks in Lincoln (1775) and Hull (1784). Despite the difficulties of wars, these precociously integrated firms experienced significant growth during the last decades of the century.<br>
<br>The Nottingham bank attracted the business of neighbouring nobility and gentry as well as that of local hosiery manufacturers and traders. Through his close association with Henry Clinton, second duke of Newcastle, Smith was returned as MP for Aldborough (1774&#150;8), and he later sat for St Ives (1780&#150;84) through the interest of Humphrey Mackworth Praed. He shared in a government victualling contract during the American war, but broke with Lord North on being excluded from the underwriting of government wartime loans. He then supported William Pitt the younger, on whose recommendation he was returned by Edward Eliot as member for St Germans (1784&#150;8).<br>
<br>At his death, on 12 July 1788, in addition to his partnerships in the several Smith banks, in Wilberforce and Smith, and in several other firms, Abel Smith left extensive land holdings, particularly in Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, a sugar estate in Jamaica, and &pound;59,953. Five of his six surviving sons (he had no daughters) became MPs. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25892/', "Robert Smith (1752&#150;1838)")</script> was created Baron Carrington in 1796. Four of his sons became partners in the Smith banks. These firms survived and prospered until 1902, when they merged with the Union Bank, which in turn was absorbed by the National Provincial Bank.<br>
