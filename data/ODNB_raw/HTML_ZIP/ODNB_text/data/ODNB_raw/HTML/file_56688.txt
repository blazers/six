<span class="headword">Yule,  Annie Henrietta</span>, Lady Yule  (1874/5&#150;1950), <span class="occ">film industry financier</span>, was the only daughter in a family of two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48955/', "Andrew Yule (1834&#150;1902)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61112/', "Yule family")</script>], merchant of Calcutta, and his wife, Emma Porter. In 1900 she married her first cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48954/', "David Yule (1858&#150;1928)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61112/', "Yule family")</script>], who until his marriage had lived a solitary bachelor existence over his business premises in Calcutta. They lived briefly together in Calcutta until she contracted malaria. She refused thereafter to spend prolonged periods in India, and he bought for her Hanstead House at Bricket Wood near St Albans, where their only child, Gladys Meryl, was born in 1903. In 1922 her husband returned to England, latterly working from a frugally furnished office in Finsbury Circus in his shirt sleeves.<br>
<br>By her husband's death on 3 July 1928 Annie Yule came to command between &pound;8 and &pound;15 million. She was then probably the richest British widow, surpassing even Dame Fanny Houston. Aged only about fifty-three when Yule died, she was restless and easily bored. As a diversion she joined J. Arthur Rank in forming a film-making company called British National (1934). Her strong if unsystematic patriotism was indicated by the title of the company. She was an original shareholder in Pinewood Studios (1936), but exchanged her stake with Rank's interest in British National (1937). Under the management of John Corfield British National produced a series of thrillers. The eerie <span class="italic">Dead Men Tell No Tales</span> (1938), about the murder of a school matron who won a lottery, was among the most successful. Though Lady Yule's commitment to filming was spasmodic, her financing of <span class="italic">Contraband</span> (1940) by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger early in the Second World War was a fillip to British film production at a moment when it might have perished. British National's low-budget melodrama <span class="italic">Love on the Dole</span> and its propagandist <span class="italic">One of our Aircraft is Missing</span> were notable successes of 1941. The chairmanship of British National and of the National Studios at Elstree was delegated by Lady Yule to Sir Henry Richardson, a director of her husband's old firm Yule, Catto. The company closed in 1948 at a time when the British film industry was stricken by a crisis of confidence and finance as a result of ill-judged meddling by the Labour government headed by Clement Attlee.<br>
<br>Lady Yule owned a stud farm at Bricket Wood, where she also kept prize-winning Jersey and Aberdeen Angus herds. Her horses enjoyed every equine luxury, including mechanical drinking-troughs. After buying a Newmarket racing stable called Balaton Lodge she ordered that her jockeys must never use their whips. She subsidized the Olympia International Horse Show, for which on one occasion she ordered forty horses to be taught to dance a quadrille to prove that English horses could be trained to do almost anything. She kept penguins and wallabies in her grounds, and formed an institution in the south of France to care for weary or ill-treated animals. Lady Yule had little obvious affection for humans other than her daughter, who having received a thousand proposals of marriage from fortune-hunters became increasingly reclusive. Although in 1946 she gave Balaton Lodge to the Veterinary Educational Trust as an equine research station, her daughter maintained the thoroughbred stud at Bricket Wood and was the leading horsewoman in Britain at her death in 1957.<br>
<br>Lady Yule had strong religious opinions, a sharp tongue, and imperious habits. She tried to enforce her teetotalism on the fifty-one crew of her yacht <i>Nahlin</i>, which she sold to Carol II of Romania shortly before the Second World War. A heavy cigarette smoker, she died of a coronary thrombosis on 14 July 1950 at Hanstead House, Bricket Wood, St Albans, Hertfordshire.<br>
