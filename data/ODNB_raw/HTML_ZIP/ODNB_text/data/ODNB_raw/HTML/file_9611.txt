<span class="headword">Fitzjames, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1538?), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Fitzjames (<i>d</i>. 1510) of Redlynch, Somerset, and the Middle Temple, recorder of Bristol, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Bluet. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9612/', "Richard Fitzjames (d. 1522)")</script>, bishop of London, was his uncle. He was admitted to the Middle Temple about 1490, was practising in chancery by 1500, and as &#145;Fitzjames junior&#146; was elected to read in the autumn of 1504 and in Lent 1508. It was clearly the son who served as treasurer of the inn from 1509 to 1511. By that time he had become attorney-general to the duchy of Lancaster, an office which he held from 1509 until his appointment as the king's attorney-general in 1519.<br>
<br>Living at Redlynch, Fitzjames was busy in Bristol, where he was retained by the abbey of St Augustine's and succeeded his father as recorder. He was steward of the manor of Bruton by 1502. As attorney-general he was responsible for conducting the trial of the duke of Buckingham for high treason in May 1521. The following month he took the coif at the general call of serjeants, and thereby automatically vacated his attorneyship. However, within the year, on 6 February 1522, he was appointed a puisne judge of the king's bench, and on 7 or 8 February chief baron of the exchequer, the offices being held in conjunction. The king continued to employ him in affairs of state, including the delicate task of negotiating a marriage between Lord Henry Percy, who was supposed to be engaged to Anne Boleyn, and Lady Mary Talbot, daughter of the earl of Shrewsbury. He was knighted about 1526. His circuits were the Oxford (until 1522) and then the western.<br>
<br>On 24 January 1526 Fitzjames was promoted to be chief justice of the king's bench in succession to Sir John Fyneux, and presided over that court through some difficult years. His opinions were frequently noted by Sir John Spelman, a fellow member of Serjeants' Inn, Chancery Lane. Fitzjames signed the articles against Wolsey in 1529, and presided in court when his confession was recorded on 30 October. His speech to the new serjeants created on 12 November 1531 is summarized by Spelman, who praised it as a &#145;good oration&#146; on the epistle of St Paul to the <span class="roman">Ephesians</span>. Besides the usual advice, he &#145;exhorted them that they should not be ambitious towards each other, but like brothers and good friends, and that none of them should take advantage of another in pleading by any trick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reports of Sir John Spelman</span>, 1.80). Later in the month he presided over the trial of Rhys ap Gryffydd and other Welshmen for high treason, summing up the evidence to the jury. In a letter to Cromwell, dated 8 March and apparently written at Redlynch in 1533, Fitzjames complains much of illness and begs to be excused attendance in London. He was present, however, at the coronation of Anne Boleyn on 1 June 1533, leading the judges in procession to Westminster on horseback.<br>
<br>In the spring and summer of 1535 Fitzjames was a prominent member of the special commissions which tried John Fisher, Thomas More, and the Carthusians for expressing treasonable opinions concerning the king's marriage and the break with Rome. It is possible that he secretly sympathized with the prisoners, preserving a discreet silence throughout most of the proceedings. When the lord chancellor directly appealed to him to say whether More's indictment was or was not sufficient, Fitzjames gave the most cautious of responses: &#145;My Lords all, by St Julian, I must needes confes that if thacte of parliament be not unlawfull, then is not the indictment in my conscience insufficient&#146;  (Roper, 95). This equivocal ruling put an end to More's defence, and yet it is difficult to see how else he could have answered without rejecting the constitutional supremacy of the king in parliament. His reputation suffered much at the hands of Lord Campbell, whose errors and fabrications were ably exposed by Foss. Earlier biographers were more positive. Lloyd said he was &#145;so fearful of the very shadow and appearance of corruption that it cost his chief clerk his place but for taking a tankard &hellip; not as a bribe, but as a civility&#146;  (Lloyd, 115). Certainly Fitzjames dismissed a servant (Edward Bosgrave) in 1533, an event which led to an action for slander in the common pleas, but it is impossible from the slender surviving evidence to make a final judgment one way or the other as to his character.<br>
<br>Fitzjames married first Jane, daughter of Thomas More of Melplash, Dorset, a member of the Middle Temple, and second Elizabeth, daughter of his fellow judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6074/', "Sir Humphrey Coningsby")</script> and widow of Sir Richard Berkeley; she outlived him. He made his will on 23 October 1538, being &#145;weake and feble in bodye with age, and dreading the casualty of this unsure and frayll world&#146;  (PROB 11/29, fol. 5), and probably died soon afterwards. The will was not proved until 1542, but a new lord chief justice was appointed in January 1539. Fitzjames asked to be buried at Bruton, Somerset, where he was co-founder of the grammar school, and Foss said there was a fine monument there, but there is no longer any trace of a memorial. The will directed that various pieces of silver, including six parcel-gilt bowls with the Fitzjames dolphin on the knops, should belong to &#145;that person that shall from tyme to tyme have my howse at Redliche&#146;, and that a great book of statutes in vellum or parchment should &#145;remayne to the howse of Redliche as a implement to the sayd howse&#146;, bequests which led to litigation in 1565. All the chief justice's other law books were left to his cousin Aldred Fitzjames, of the Middle Temple, his own son John (a bencher of the inn) having predeceased him.<br>
