<span class="headword">Sansom <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fowke]</span>,  Martha</span>  (1689&#150;1736), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 1 May 1689 at Hertingfordbury Park, Hertfordshire, the eldest child of Major Thomas Fowke (<i>d</i>. 1708), of a Staffordshire gentry family, and his third wife, Mary Chandler, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cullen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1705). She was educated at home by tutors, and subsequently at boarding-school. She was brought up a Roman Catholic, but later became a non-practising Anglican. Her autobiographical <span class="italic">Clio</span> (written in 1723 but not published until 1752) records her early passion for French romances and love poetry, and a literary ambition discouraged by her mother but nurtured by her father. On her mother's death and her father's return to the army in 1705 she moved in with friends in London. Her father's murder in 1708 proved a devastating blow.<br>
<br>Fowke's earliest published verse appeared in <span class="italic">Delights for the Ingenious</span> (1711). She first achieved public fame in 1720 with verse published in Anthony Hammond's <span class="italic">New Miscellany</span> and with <span class="italic">Clio and Strephon</span>, an important Platonic poetic correspondence with William Bond prefaced by a critical essay by John Porter, which went through several editions. She enjoyed wide-ranging literary friendships, particularly with the poet and critic Aaron Hill, and the poet John Dyer, whose career she encouraged, as well as earning the enmity of others, notably Eliza Haywood, who attacked her in <span class="italic">The Injur'd Husband</span> (1723) and the <span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of Utopia</span> (1725&#150;6). Nine poems by Clio, and verses addressed to her, feature in Richard Savage's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span> (1726).<br>
<br>By 1721 Fowke's younger brother Thomas had persuaded her to regularize her relationship with Arnold Sansom, a lawyer some years her senior. The marriage proved miserable. Martha left London for East Anglia in 1730, when her husband took up a political post there. He died of alcoholism four years later. She subsequently joined her brother in Leicestershire, where she died on 17 February 1736 at the early age of forty-six. She was buried at St Martin's Church, Leicester.<br>
<br>During her lifetime Martha Sansom's poetic reputation was blackened by the moral aspersions cast on her character by Haywood and subsequently echoed by Dr Johnson. Recent scholarship has discovered in her work a strongly individual female voice, passionate in quest of literary renown, personal liberty, and a marriage of true minds. Her poetic self-portrait, &#145;Clio's Picture&#146;, consciously opposes contemporary conventions of femininity with a wry account of her own unconventional dark looks. In her poetry she frequently registers her contempt for the narrow confines of female domesticity:<blockquote>
<div>I was, oh hated Thought! a Woman made;<br>
</div>
<div>For household Cares, and empty Trifles meant.<br>
</div> (Savage, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span>, 209&#150;10)</blockquote>Much of her writing was first circulated in manuscript, and recent evidence has considerably enlarged the known corpus of her poems, including some fine amatory verse first printed in the <span class="italic">Barbados Gazette</span>, subsequently collected in <span class="italic">Caribbeana</span> (London, 1741).<br>
