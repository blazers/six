<span class="headword">Redlich,  Josef</span>  (1869&#150;1936), <span class="occ">scholar and politician</span>, was born on 18 June 1869 at G&ouml;ding (Hodonin), Moravia, the second of five children and younger son of Adolf Redlich (1839&#150;1896), sugar manufacturer, and his wife, Rosa Fanto (<i>d</i>. 1908). Coming from a German-Jewish family background in a rural Slav area, he was sent to Vienna in 1878 to attend the Akademisches Gymnasium, one of the leading secondary schools, from which he graduated in 1886. From 1886 to 1891 he studied law, political science, and history at the universities of Vienna, Leipzig, and T&uuml;bingen. During this period he visited England for the first time. He was awarded a doctorate in law at the University of Vienna in 1891. <br>
<br>After two years of administrative work at the office of the governor of Moravia, Redlich returned to Vienna to engage in scholarly research. He visited England frequently in the following years, winning the friendship of such men as F. W. Maitland, A. W. Dicey, James Bryce, R. W. Seton-Watson, and F. W. Hirst, and was deeply influenced by the political programme of the Fabian Society. In 1893 he participated in organizing a Fabian Society in Vienna and became co-founder of the weekly <span class="italic">Die Zeit</span> (later turned into an influential liberal daily), to which he contributed articles dealing with legal, administrative, and political topics. In 1897 he was baptized as a protestant before marrying Alice, daughter of Konsul Gustav Simon from K&ouml;nigsberg, with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67644/', "Hans Ferdinand Redlich")</script>, who became a renowned musicologist. <br>
<br>Entering a career as a scholar, Redlich was led by the study of Rudolf Gneist's works on English administrative and constitutional history to undertake intensive research in English administrative law. This resulted in a two-volume study, <span class="italic">Local Government in England</span>, first published in German at Vienna in 1901 and translated and edited by his friend Hirst in 1903. Based on the thesis that the English system of local administration represented the direct influence of the political and social ideas of democracy on the organization and function of government, the book established his reputation as a scholar and led to his being recognized as a leading authority on English political science. It gained him the appointment as <i>Privatdozent f&uuml;r Staats- und Verwaltungsrecht</i> at the University of Vienna in 1901. <br>
<br>Redlich's next book, <span class="italic">Recht und Technik des englischen Parlamentarismus</span> (1905) was translated into English and published in three volumes as <span class="italic">The Procedure of the House of Commons</span> (1908). It became the standard and authoritative handbook for parliamentary procedure in England. Courtenay Ilbert, clerk of the House of Commons, who wrote an introduction to the translation, described the work as indispensable not only for the scholar but even more for the routine activities of the members of parliament. In 1910 Redlich demonstrated in his third book, <span class="italic">Das Wesen der &ouml;sterreichischen Kommunalverfassung</span>, his insight into the complicated administrative system of his fatherland. <br>
<br>Redlich's scholarly activities were made possible by the family agreement, which had made his beloved elder brother Fritz the manager of the factory and financial holdings of the family, while Josef was guaranteed a regular income from the family property. By this arrangement he could lead a carefree life which enabled him to buy a spacious Biedermeier-style villa in the fashionable D&ouml;bling district in Vienna even during his years as unpaid <i>Privatdozent</i>. In 1906 he entered politics, being elected to the Moravian diet as representative of his native town, G&ouml;ding. He was elected representative to the lower house of parliament in 1907, joining the Deutscher Nationalverband. In 1908 he was appointed professor of constitutional and administrative law at the Technical University of Vienna. While he was successful during these years as a scholar and in politics, his marriage broke down and in 1908 he divorced his unfaithful wife. <br>
<br>The diaries which Redlich kept during the years 1908 to 1919 show how he managed to combine political engagement, scholarly activities, and a busy social life. An ebullient manner combined with his scintillating wit and brilliant conversation made him a well-liked guest in aristocratic circles as well as a close friend of leading artists and writers such as Gustav Mahler, Hermann Bahr, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. A passionate letter writer, his correspondence with Bahr and von Hofmannsthal, along with Austrian statesmen and diplomatists, as well as with leading scholars in England and the USA is a highly valuable source for the political, social, and cultural history of the first twenty years of the twentieth century. Redlich's position in parliament was that of an outsider who was admired for his eloquent speeches, but viewed with suspicion for his nonconformist tendencies, such as maintaining contact with representatives from other parties and with representatives from non-German nationalities. He had a close relationship to T. G. Masaryk who, born in G&ouml;ding on the Redlich property, was rumoured to be more than just a friend to the family. <br>
<br>Redlich's scholarly reputation as an expert in Anglo-Saxon law brought him invitations to lecture in the USA. In 1910 he was invited to Harvard University as Godkin lecturer and later travelled to the United States as guest speaker at various universities. During 1913&#150;14 he taught comparative law at the James Schouler Foundation of the Johns Hopkins University. Invited by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to study the methods of legal studies in the USA, he published in 1914 <span class="italic">The Common Law and the Case Method in American University Law Schools</span>, which gained him admiration from the American scholarly establishment. <br>
<br>As an expert on administrative law Redlich was appointed head of a committee to reform and streamline the Austrian bureaucracy. His close contacts with the foreign minister, Aehrenthal, and friendship with several of the younger diplomatists in the Austro-Hungarian foreign service also led to various assignments in Balkan affairs. Redlich supported the position of the Austro-Hungarian and the German governments at the outbreak of the First World War, but he slowly became critical of German imperialism and war policy, breaking with his party of German nationalists in parliament. In July 1917 Emperor Charles briefly considered appointing him prime minister, and he was appointed minister of finance in the last cabinet of the Habsburg monarchy in October&#150;November 1918. In that depressing period Redlich found consolation in private fulfilments. At the home of his brother he met Gertrude Flaschar (1900&#150;1976), daughter of a Styrian lawyer; they married on 10 August 1919 and had two daughters, Lore, born in 1920 and Rosemary, born in 1922. <br>
<br>After the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy Redlich withdrew from politics, though the republican government tried in 1921 to exploit his transatlantic reputation by sending him as an unofficial envoy to the USA in order to raise a loan to avert national bankruptcy. This journey brought no positive results for the Austrian government but led to the re-establishment of Redlich's contact with American universities. Redlich resumed the life of a savant, spreading his interests as well as his activities over two continents: during the war years Redlich had already begun a monumental study, <span class="italic">Das &ouml;sterreichische Staats- und Reichsproblem</span>, a history of administrative and constitutional changes in Austria from Empress Maria Theresa to Emperor Franz Josef, and it was published in two volumes, in 1920 and 1926. On an assignment for the Carnegie Foundation on War and Peace he prepared a small book, <span class="italic">Austrian War Government</span> (1929). In 1922 he was invited as Lowell lecturer at Boston to speak on problems of national self-determination at the Institute of Politics in Williamstown, Massachusetts. In 1926 he became professor of comparative public law at Harvard law school, being appointed to the Charles Stebbins Fairchild chair three years later. While living in the USA he wrote a biography of Emperor Franz Josef, published simultaneously in English and German (1929). Having been elected in 1929 deputy judge to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague he returned to Austrian politics in 1931, when Karl Buresch invited him to join his government as minister of finance, hoping that Redlich's international reputation might be of help in solving the financial crisis of the republic. Once again Redlich's government engagement was of short duration for he resigned after four months, returning to his academic position in the USA. In 1934, when his physical health began to fail, he resigned his professorship at Harvard and returned to Vienna, where he died on 11 November 1936. He was buried in the D&ouml;blinger cemetery, Vienna.<br>
