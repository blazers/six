<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rowland <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Fuhrhop]</span>,  Roland Walter <span class="st"> [Tiny]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 27 November 1917 at the Belgaum detention camp, Simla, India, an internment centre for enemy aliens, the third and youngest son of Wilhelm Fuhrhop, later William Frederick Rowland (1885&#150;1974), a Hamburg-born merchant, and his Anglo-Dutch wife, Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kauenhoven (1883&#150;1944). After the war his family was initially refused entry to Britain, and instead settled in Hamburg.<h2>
<a name="GermanyandEngland"></a>Germany and England</h2>Fuhrhop was educated at Heinrich Herz Real Gymnasium, Hamburg. A big blond sportsman of robust charm, he enlisted in the Hitler Youth during the early 1930s, and served as a troop leader. Nevertheless his father's anti-Nazi sentiments led the family to leave Germany, and this time they were successful in settling in England. Roland Fuhrhop was then educated at Churchers College, Petersfield, for a year. He developed a cut-glass English accent and governing-class mannerisms, although his first employer was a haulage company in Bethnal Green Road specializing in freight to and from Germany. Even in this period his dress-sense was immaculate. He repudiated his German passport and changed his name by deed poll to Roland Walter Rowland in October 1939. From boyhood he had been nicknamed Tiny, and he always preferred to use this sobriquet, even in official business correspondence.<br>
<br>Rowland was conscripted into the British army in December 1939 and assigned to the Royal Army Medical Corps in Scotland. His devotion to his mother had always been pronounced, and after she became seriously ill he went absent without leave to visit her. As a result, in 1941 he spent twenty-seven days in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison, where he was brutally treated. His parents were interned on the Isle of Man during the war and, being suspected of pro-German sympathies, Rowland was discharged from the army in 1942. Subsequently he was detained under regulation 18B on the Isle of Man, where he remained until after his mother's death. These harsh experiences, including his mother's treatment when she was dying of cancer, may have contributed to his contempt for British financial and political institutions. The prejudice against his background was persistent. Margaret Thatcher, explaining in 1987 the mutual antipathy between them, said, &#145;Of course, he's not English&#146;  (Wyatt, 1.306).<br>
<br>After leaving the Isle of Man Rowland was compelled to accept work ordained by the labour exchange as a porter at Paddington railway station. Soon he was living in Mayfair, working as a taxi driver, and operating as a spiv supplying scarce luxuries including lipstick and oranges. In 1946 he began trading in army surplus material, chiefly iron and scissors, and in 1947 started a company producing domestic refrigerators. After an initially profitable phase the business collapsed with heavy tax liabilities.<h2>
<a name="RhodesiaandLonrho"></a>Rhodesia and Lonrho</h2>Rowland moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1948, and bought a tobacco farm and truck store at Eiffel Flats, on the main road between Salisbury and Bulawayo. Although he had the accoutrements of a prosperous man, these were frustrating years. From 1952 he lived with Irene Smith (<i>b</i>. 1912?), the wife of his business partner; it was a difficult relationship, which he left in 1963. Farming in Rhodesia did not stretch him, and he acquired the Rhodesian franchise for Mercedes Benz cars, two dubious goldmines, and an option to build an oil pipeline from the Mozambique port of Beira to Umtali in Rhodesia. These were consolidated in a holding company, Shepton Estates.<br>
<br>In 1961 a Scottish nobleman, Angus Ogilvy, was sent to Salisbury to revive the London and Rhodesia Mining and Land Company (L &amp; R); formed in 1909, it had once been the most valuable company in Rhodesia. After a long decline it had come under the control of the London financier Harley Drayton. Rowland, a beguiling negotiator, convinced Ogilvy that L &amp; R should acquire Shepton Estates. He was lavishly rewarded with 1.5 million L &amp; R shares plus an option on a further 2 million. Rowland also became joint managing director of L &amp; R, which subsequently changed its name to Lonrho. This arrangement was a personal masterstroke for Rowland, who in the next thirty years earned over &pound;100 million from Lonrho in salary and dividends.<br>
<br>The company began building Rowland's pipeline from Beira to Umtali in 1962. Mistrusting the racial and economic policies of Southern Rhodesia well before its unilateral declaration of independence in 1965, Rowland extended Lonrho's ramifications. At a time when other white investors could see only uncertainties in post-colonial Africa, he realized that Lonrho could acquire promising assets at discounted prices. Its campaign of diversified investments began in Nyasaland in 1962. During the mid-1960s Zambia became crucial to the company's expansion. Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, and Hastings Banda of Malawi were among the African presidents who became Rowland's business allies. A major step in Lonrho's accumulating value was its acquisition in 1968 of a fifty-year lease on the Asante goldmines in Ghana. By 1970 Lonrho had assets of &pound;198 million, with over 100,000 employees in twenty-nine countries, but debts of &pound;117 million. Pre-tax profits were nearly &pound;20 million by 1973 and &pound;180 million by 1980. Its diverse interests included mines, factories, motor-car distributorships throughout Africa, hotels, trading businesses, and farms. Lonrho became the biggest food producer in Africa. Rowland travelled the continent in the company's own jet aircraft seeking or clinching deals. The hectic schedules did not seem to weary him. His fastidiousness about his own clothes, food, and drink did not extend into the corrupt, menacing, and volatile world of African business. Huge bribes were paid. Latterly he was said always to have travelled with a locked case containing &pound;100,000 in cash for immediate expenses.<br>
<br>On 1 July 1968 Rowland married Josie Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1944), daughter of Lionel Taylor, who had been his farm manager in Rhodesia. He had met her when she was a little child, and had been a protective presence throughout her girlhood: reputedly he partly paid for her education. Despite unconventional elements in his courtship, he proved an exemplary husband. They had a son and three daughters.<h2>
<a name="Challenges"></a>Challenges</h2>The oil embargo imposed by the Wilson government on Rhodesia was a sham, and Tiny Rowland's remonstrations on the subject led to friction between Lonrho and the Foreign Office from 1967. He regarded United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia as both hypocritical and unenforceable: Lonrho circumvented them. The company's reputation was further injured when several of its executives were accused in South Africa of fraud over the Inyati copper mine in Rhodesia (1971&#150;3). However, he retained the respect of black African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, while Lonrho developed large mining investments in South Africa under the Afrikaner regime.<br>
<br>A secretive, ruthless, and self-confident man, Rowland's consultations of board colleagues before taking big decisions were desultory or non-existent. Non-executive directors he likened to Christmas-tree decorations. He was a deal-maker, with a compelling desire to expand the business, who scoffed at the disciplined precision of accountants. The management, financial controls, and return on investment of some of the company's African interests were shoddy. In 1971, when the speed of Lonrho's expansion had strained its finances, Rowland acquired the rights to the Wankel rotary engine for the equivalent of &pound;12 million. Most of his directors were unaware of the negotiations, and Sir Siegmund Warburg instructed his merchant bank to resign as Lonrho's financial advisers. Two directors resigned in protest, too. One of them subsequently described Rowland to Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) inspectors as:<blockquote>a man who had completely converted what was a sleep dozy company into something dynamic and who was a sort of tyrant and part madman to boot, but a brilliant one, and whose tyranny and madness had not become completely evident, and who was extremely persuasive. (Bower, 281)</blockquote>In 1972 the accountants Peat Marwick delivered a 1566 page report on Lonrho which revealed the company's poor performance. Rowland was obliged to accept outside directors, including a deputy chairman suggested by the Bank of England, Sir Basil Smallpeice. The views of Rowland and Smallpeice quickly proved irreconcilable, and after much unpleasantness, during a period when Lonrho's debts were escalating, a crisis occurred after the revelation of covert financial arrangements to benefit the chairman, Duncan Sandys. In 1973 eight directors led by Smallpeice struggled to remove Rowland as chief executive. Heavily publicized litigation revealed the payments to Sandys, which had been channelled through the Cayman Islands. This tax avoidance device was denounced in May 1973 by the prime minister, Edward Heath, who had long shown animosity against Sandys, in a phrase which forever tarnished Rowland's reputation, as the &#145;unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism&#146;  (Bower, 252). However, Rowland outmanoeuvred his critics and ultimately vanquished them at Lonrho's annual general meeting. The company's managerial idiosyncrasies and commitments in Africa meant that institutional investors had shunned it since 1971. Consequently, aside from Rowland's 20 per cent holding, the shares belonged to small investors, who showed ardent loyalty to him. He rallied them to defeat his critics, and thereafter ensured that Lonrho's directors were unable to challenge his prerogatives or question his obsessions. He was fiercely loyal to friends, but unforgiving if they failed him.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the crisis of 1972&#150;3 Kuwaiti and other groups invested in Lonrho. DTI inspectors began a long investigation of the company, paying undue attention to Lonrho's subsidies of Rowland's domestic life. In 1967, shortly before his marriage, the company bought a house for him at Hedsor Wharf on the Thames: Bourne End was a gabled brick eighteenth-century cottage which had been enlarged by Lord Boston in 1925. At Rowland's instructions the building was extended and remodelled in undistinguished neo-Georgian style in 1969&#150;71, and the grounds extensively improved, at a total cost of &pound;323,589. The DTI report, which was published in 1976, unsurprisingly proved hostile to Lonrho's methods. This official condemnation caused Rowland anguish, and in 1977 he began a mischievous correspondence with government departments to show up their humbug in conniving with other companies flouting its oil sanctions against Rhodesia. Subsequently he circulated a damning, authoritative dossier on the subject. His interventions forced the appointment of a government inquiry into his allegations conducted by Thomas Bingham QC. Bingham's report (issued in 1978) vindicated Rowland's claims, and exposed the worthlessness of the costly naval &#145;blockade&#146; of oil to Rhodesia instituted by the Wilson government.<h2>
<a name="Feuds"></a>Feuds</h2>In the 1970s Rowland was urged to repair Lonrho's relations with the Conservative Party leadership by making donations to its funds. This he refused to do. His relations with its leaders remained poor, and he met obstacles during the 1980s that were not presented to his contemporaries. He was also urged to reduce Lonrho's dependence on Africa for its earnings. Consequently, in 1977, the company began buying shares in Scottish and Universal Trusts, the holding company of Sir Hugh Fraser's interests, which controlled 29 per cent of the House of Fraser store group, owners of Harrods. In 1979 Lonrho acquired Scottish and Universal for &pound;56.6 million. However, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission used Lonrho's ownership of the textile firm Brentford Nylons as a pretext to stop Lonrho bidding for the House of Fraser in 1981. The commission's recommendations were obtrusively flawed and prejudiced, but Lonrho's attempts to gain control of Harrods continued to be foiled by Whitehall. In 1984 Rowland determined to lodge Lonrho's Fraser shares with an Egyptian, Mohamed Al Fayed, before making a renewed bid: 46.1 million shares were transferred to Fayed for &pound;138 million (a profit for Lonrho of &pound;80 million). Rowland's confidence that Fayed could not afford to buy Fraser was misplaced: Fayed raised &pound;615 million, persuaded the government to approve his acquisition of the House of Fraser, and took over Harrods in 1985.<br>
<br>Rowland was justifiably aggrieved at the government's handling of the affair, and made grave allegations against Fayed. He paid for a robust campaign publicizing the anomalies and enlisted <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (which Lonrho had bought in 1981 for &pound;6 million) in his cause. He succeeded in forcing a Department of Trade inquiry, which in 1987 vindicated many of his allegations, but the Thatcher government regarded him as an enemy and would take no steps to redress the injustice. The government's refusal to publish this report, or to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, was unreasonable but was ultimately upheld by the judiciary. When <span class="italic">The Observer</span> published the contents of the report in a special edition issued on the day of Lonrho's annual general meeting in 1989, the attorney-general obtained an injunction against its distribution. This did not prevent widespread circulation of the report, which indicted ministers, officials, bankers, and lawyers for lax or disreputable conduct.<br>
<br>Revenge against the Thatcher government became a fixation for Rowland. He had no qualms about his methods: <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, for example, published offensive allegations about the financial interests of the prime minister's son. In 1986 Lonrho bought <span class="italic">Today</span> newspaper for &pound;10 million. The newspaper was relaunched as a supporter of David Owen's Social Democratic Party, which Rowland began bank-rolling just as it went into electoral oblivion. &#145;Tiny Rowland had no idea what he was doing commercially when he bought <span class="italic">Today</span>&#146;, Woodrow Wyatt concluded after a discussion with Rupert Murdoch in 1987. &#145;He got it only as another vengeful weapon to use against Mrs. Thatcher whom he hates beyond reason&#146;  (Wyatt, 1.373).<br>
<br>Rowland was a dangerous adversary. During 1988 the Australian tycoon Alan Bond spent &pound;300 million buying a 21 per cent holding in Lonrho and boasted that he was Rowland's natural successor. His 164 foot yacht <i>Southern Cross III</i> was moored in Adnan Khashoggi's marina at Antibes next to Rowland's beloved 164 foot <i>Hansa</i>, which he had bought in 1987. Bond's captain enquired of his counterpart on <i>Hansa</i> when the latter would be moving so that Bond's yacht could take the mooring. The implication was that Rowland should accommodate Lonrho's biggest shareholder. &#145;It was so embarrassing&#146;, Rowland supposedly said. &#145;It was then that I decided to destroy him&#146;  (Bower, 540). He published a ninety-three page document demonstrating in the most trenchant terms that Bond's businesses were technically insolvent and sustained only by a fragile pyramid of borrowings. Bond's bankers called in their loans, his companies collapsed, and he was briefly imprisoned.<br>
<br>Rowland was a formidable presence. A visitor described him in 1989:<blockquote>He sits in the boardroom of Lonrho after lunch, immobile except for the occasional movements necessary to place a grape in his mouth and chew it. He is like a crocodile, steadily watching and waiting. He looks you straight in the eye. At any moment he may dismiss you as ill-informed or stupid. The jaws may snap. Meanwhile he listens and tells you without hesitation or doubt what the facts are and how they should be interpreted. (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>)</blockquote>But he became too obsessed by his feud with Fayed to protect his business. Lonrho's dividend was cut in 1991, and debts of about &pound;1 billion necessitated the sale of various assets. Controversially, in 1992, Lonrho sold some hotels for &pound;177.5 million to the Libyan government while the United Nations was considering sanctions against Colonel Gaddafi's regime. This deal revived doubts about Rowland's judgement and integrity. In December 1992 he arranged for the eventual sale of his 15 per cent holding in Lonrho to a German property developer, Dieter Bock, at a price substantially higher than that which small investors could hope to obtain. This raised a further outcry. Bock and Rowland shared the responsibilities of chief executive for a period, but the older man was enraged as parts of the group were sold lucratively. Among other dispersals, <span class="italic">The Observer</span> was sold in 1993 to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. Rowland was isolated in the titular post of president of Lonrho in 1994.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Rowland was tall, handsome, and had an authoritative (even mesmeric) presence even in old age. His names and mannerisms were somewhat artificial self-inventions, and he was blazingly intolerant of any challenges to his versions of reality. Ostentatious living or brash manners bored and repelled him. He disliked accepting hospitality from others. From the 1960s his use of the telephone was perhaps more profuse, and the political altitude of his callers more elevated, than those of any man alive. He was devious, inscrutable, manipulative, and intimidating. Cruel amusement was central to his outlook. His humour was mordant and his invective could be overpowering. He had few interests outside Lonrho, although he adored sun-bathing, liked Siamese cats, and collected African and German expressionist art. He was a superbly accomplished opportunist who was too headstrong and angry to sustain his successes. He died of cancer at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 25 July 1998. He was survived by his wife, Josie, and their four children.<br>
