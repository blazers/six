<span class="headword">Shelton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1845), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was commissioned ensign in the 9th foot on 21 November 1805, became lieutenant on 26 August 1807, and captain on 17 June 1813. He served with the 9th in Portugal in 1808, being present at Roli&ccedil;a, Vimeiro, and Corunna; in the Walcheren expedition of 1809; and again in the Peninsula in 1812&#150;13. He was at the siege and capture of Badajoz, at Salamanca, Burgos, Vitoria, and San Sebastian, where he lost his right arm. In 1814 he served in Canada. In 1817 he exchanged into the 44th foot (later 1st battalion, Essex regiment), which went to India in 1822, and was employed in Arakan during the First Anglo-Burmese War. He became regimental major on 6 February 1825, and lieutenant-colonel on 16 September 1827. For the next thirteen years he commanded the 44th in India, respected but not liked by the officers and men, for he was a harsh and imperious martinet, &#145;not a pleasant man on parade&#146;.<br>
<br>At the end of 1840 Shelton was put in charge of a brigade, the 44th and two Indian regiments, to replace part of the force in Afghanistan. Colin Mackenzie, who accompanied the brigade, wrote that &#145;Shelton's gross want of arrangement and the unnecessary hardship he has exposed the men to &hellip; have caused much discontent&#146;  (Macrory, 137). He reached Jalalabad with his brigade in January 1841, made a punitive expedition into the Nazian valley in February, had to return through the Khyber to the Indus in May to open the road for Shah Shuja's family, and arrived at Kabul on 9 June. There, with the rank of brigadier-general, he was second in command to the ineffectual Elphinstone. Brave in battle but apparently stupid, Shelton was morose, cantankerous, churlish, bad-tempered, friendless, hated by officers and men, and openly contemptuous of Elphinstone, who disliked and distrusted him, and they failed to co-operate. Elphinstone wrote of Shelton, &#145;his manner was most contumacious &hellip; he &hellip; invariably found fault with all that was done&#146;  (Macrory, 169). George Lawrence considered him &#145;a great croaker and anxious to return to India&#146;  (Macrory, 157). However, as Sir John Fortescue wrote, &#145;it can never be known how far incessant physical pain, due to the rough surgery of those days, may have embittered his character&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 163).<br>
<br>Shelton was camped at Siah Sang, 2 miles east of the city, when the Afghan outbreak began, on 2 November 1841, with the murder of Sir Alexander Burnes. He was ordered to occupy the Bala Hissar (the Kabul citadel) with part of his brigade, to reinforce the shah's troops; but when he had been there a week he was summoned to the cantonments to assist Elphinstone and infuse some vigour into the defence. By then (9 November) the commissariat fort with vital supplies had been lost. The cantonments were commanded by the adjacent hills; their boundary was of no defensive strength, and nearly 2 miles long. There was only one British regiment, the 44th, and this, like others, was discouraged. Elphinstone, infirm and unstable, asked the advice of everyone, but would delegate authority to no one. Sir William Macnaghten, the envoy, energetic and self-confident, had much to say on military measures, and Shelton was ordered to carry out operations of which he disapproved. His own unyielding temper was ill suited to such a position. In this crisis he failed to provide decisive and effective leadership. At councils of war he ostentatiously slept or feigned sleep, and criticized Macnaghten in his absence. When Colin Mackenzie protested Shelton replied, &#145;Damn it, Mackenzie, I <i>will</i> sneer at him! I <i>like</i> to sneer at him!&#146;  (Macrory, 171).<br>
<br>On 10 November Shelton led an attack on the Rikabashee Fort, which was within 400 yards of the north-east angle of the cantonments. He had twice to rally his men before the fort was taken, and the 44th had nearly 100 men killed or wounded. He bungled his sortie to the Beymaroo hills (23 November), using unsuitable square formation and unnecessarily exposing his force to enemy fire and the resultant casualties; his force was routed and the survivors further discouraged. For &#145;this most disgraceful day&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 224) Shelton blamed the Sepoys, but contemporaries blamed Shelton.<br>
<br>Shelton favoured withdrawal from Kabul, but it was not until 11 December, when reportedly only one day's provisions remained, that Macnaghten met the Afghan chiefs in conference. He was treacherously shot by Akbar Khan on 23 December, and on 6 January 1842 the retreat from Kabul began.<br>
<br>During the retreat Shelton fought bravely with the rearguard. At Jagdalak on 11 January he was ordered to accompany Elphinstone to a meeting with Akbar Khan, and to remain with the latter as a hostage. He thus escaped the final massacre. He was well treated, quarrelled with his fellow captives, and was rescued with them by Sir Richmond Shakespeare and his cavalry on 17 September, after Sir George Pollock had reoccupied Kabul.<br>
<br>Elphinstone, whom Shelton blamed, had died and Shelton, the senior surviving officer, on 20 January 1843 was court-martialled at Ludhiana on four charges: ordering preparations to be made for retreat without authority; using disrespectful language to the general within hearing of the troops; entering into clandestine correspondence with Akbar Khan to obtain forage for his own horses while the envoy's negotiations were going on; suffering himself to be taken prisoner at Jagdalak by want of due precaution. He was acquitted on all charges except the third, and the court held that that had been duly censured at the time. They praised his &#145;personal gallantry of the highest kind, and &hellip; noble devotion as a soldier&#146;  (Macrory, 269).<br>
<br>Shelton returned to England and resumed command of the 44th, which had been practically raised afresh at its Colchester depot. He had become colonel in the army on 23 November 1841, and had had the local rank of major-general in India. On 10 May 1845, when the 44th was at Richmond barracks, Dublin, his horse bolted and threw him in the barrack square, inflicting such injuries on him that he died after three days' agony. Reportedly when the regiment heard of his death they turned out on the parade ground and gave three cheers. His remains were interred &#145;with unusual military pomp&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 197) at St Peter's Church, Dublin. He left considerable property which passed to his nephew, Lieutenant William Shelton, 9th foot. He received no medals or decorations for his many campaigns, except Shah Shuja's discredited order of the Durrani empire. Sir John Fortescue later wrote of him: &#145;the brightest figure in the retreat from Kabul &hellip; to so gallant a spirit surely much may be forgiven&#146;  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 245). Maybe, but there was much to forgive.<br>
