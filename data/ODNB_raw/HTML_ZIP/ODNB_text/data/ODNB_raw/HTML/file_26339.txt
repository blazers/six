<span class="headword">Stedman,  John Andrew</span>  (1778&#150;1833), <span class="occ">army officer in the Dutch service</span>, was born in 1778, at Zutphen in the Netherlands, the only son of William George Stedman. Both his father and grandfather, who belonged to the same family as Charles Stedman and John Gabriel Stedman, were officers in the Scots brigade in the service of the states general of the United Provinces&#151;a corps whose history extended from 1570 to 1783. Both married Dutch wives of noble blood. In 1783, when the Scots brigade was formed into Dutch regiments, and most of the officers resigned their commissions, Captain Stedman chose to be naturalized in the country of his adoption.<br>
<br>John Andrew received a commission in the Dutch army when still a child. At the age of sixteen he first saw service with the allied forces, under the duke of York and the prince of Orange, which in 1794 were on the northern frontier of France. His next service was in 1799, when the Batavian republic was in alliance with France, and the duke of York commanded the opposing army at Bergen. In 1809 he again served against the British at Walcheren. Meanwhile he had held important staff appointments and, on the incorporation of the kingdom of Holland with France, became general of brigade in the French army. In this capacity he served for two years in Italy, and was present at the battles of Bautzen and Dresden.<br>
<br>In 1814 Stedman attached himself to the prince of Orange, afterwards King William of the Netherlands, and commanded the Dutch troops in reserve at Waterloo, with the rank of lieutenant-general. He married Nicola Gertrude van de Poll, granddaughter of the last reigning burgomaster of Amsterdam. Stedman died at Nijmegen in 1833. His only son, Charles John William Stedman, became a Prussian subject, settling at Besselich Abbey, near Koblenz. He was a member of the national assemblies of Frankfurt and Erfurt, and received the title of <i>Freiherr</i>, or baron. He had a large family, of which nearly all the sons entered the Queen Augusta regiment of guards; they reverted to the original family name of Barton.<br>
