<span class="headword">Henslow,  John Stevens</span>  (1796&#150;1861), <span class="occ">botanist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 6 February 1796 at Rochester, Kent. He was the eldest of eleven children; his father was John Prentis Henslow, a solicitor, and his mother, Frances, was daughter of Thomas Stevens, a wealthy Rochester brewer. Surrounded by many books on natural history and greatly encouraged by both his parents, the young Henslow began his education at home, continuing at day schools in Rochester and then, as a boarder, at a school in Camberwell. Here the drawing-master, George Samuel, a keen entomologist, introduced Henslow to eminent zoologists and entomologists.<br>
<br>In October 1814 Henslow entered St John's College, Cambridge. At that time there was little choice of subject available, and his study was principally mathematical. He obtained a reasonable BA degree in January 1818 and became a fellow of the Linnean Society on 9 February 1818. Henslow added geology to his interests by accompanying the newly appointed Woodwardian professor of geology, Adam Sedgwick, on a tour of the Isle of Wight in 1819. Their idea to found a &#145;corresponding society&#146; to promote science in Cambridge came to fruition in November 1819, when they established the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Henslow was, it may be assumed, judged too young to be an officer, but he became one of the secretaries in 1821 and held the office for eighteen years.<br>
<br>On the death of Clarke, in 1822, the chair of mineralogy became vacant, and Henslow was elected. This election was a complex and acrimonious affair, but Henslow's part in it seems to have been entirely honourable. In succeeding Clarke, who was a popular lecturer and brilliant showman, he had taken on a difficult challenge. Henslow's style of lecturing, to quote Leonard Jenyns, his brother-in-law and biographer, &#145;was not what would be called eloquent, but he had a good voice and a remarkably clear way of expressing himself&#146;. Being now assured of an academic career, Henslow married Harriet (1797&#150;1857), daughter of Revd George Leonard Jenyns of Bottisham Hall, on 16 December 1823 and set up house in Cambridge. Two years later, on the death of Thomas Martyn, the professor of botany, he succeeded to this chair also and began his rejuvenation of botanical science in Cambridge. Shortly afterwards he resigned his professorship of mineralogy.<br>
<br>In 1824 Henslow was ordained and obtained a curacy in Cambridge. Whatever struggle took place in his mind about the relative merits of a church or a university career, there is some evidence that the resolution of doctrinal difficulties affecting his Christian belief was important in shaping his future career. There is little difficulty in understanding his acceptance of the chair of botany, however. The aged Martyn had treated his professorship as a sinecure, and had ceased to live in Cambridge, or even visit it, for nearly thirty years. What survived of Cambridge botany was a small, traditional botanical garden unsuited, to use Henslow's own words, &#145;to the demands of modern science&#146;; in it there was little or no botanical teaching or research. This was a real challenge to a gifted and enthusiastic young man, and he set about rescuing what he could from the old museum, planning a course of botanical lectures and practical &#145;demonstrations&#146;, and setting in motion the plans for the new Cambridge Botanic Garden on the present site of nearly 40 acres. Disarmingly, Henslow himself is quoted as saying of his election to the chair of botany: &#145;when appointed, I knew very little indeed about botany &hellip; but I probably knew as much of the subject as any other resident in Cambridge&#146;  (J. S. Henslow, <span class="italic">Address to the members of the University of Cambridge on &hellip; the botanic garden</span>, 1846).<br>
<br>From 1825 to 1832 seems to have been a golden age for botanical science in Cambridge. Not only were Henslow's lectures well attended, but the more gifted pupils found the young professor charming, friendly, accessible, and very knowledgeable over the whole field of natural science. The field classes run by Henslow became very popular, partly because they took in zoology and geology as freely as botany, and the Friday evening soir&eacute;es at the Henslow home overlooking Parker's Piece were brilliantly successful. The young Charles Darwin, who went up to Christ's College in 1828, fell under his spell, with important consequences for modern biological science. Darwin assessed his teacher thus:<blockquote>He had a remarkable power of making the young feel completely at ease with him, though we were all awe-struck with the amount of his knowledge &hellip; When I reflect how immediately we felt at ease &hellip; I think it was as much owing to the transparent sincerity of his character, as to his kindness of heart; and, perhaps even still more to the highly remarkable absence in him of all self-consciousness. (Jenyns, 51)</blockquote>Thus began a lifelong friendship, which survived even the strain of the publication of <span class="italic">The Origin of Species</span> in 1859. Ironically, Henslow, who had first recommended Darwin as naturalist for the <i>Beagle</i>, was in the chair for the famous meeting of the British Association in Oxford in 1860 when Thomas Henry Huxley clashed with Bishop Wilberforce over man's descent from the apes.<br>
<br>Henslow's only substantial work, entitled <span class="italic">The Principles of Descriptive and Physiological Botany</span>, published in 1835, made widely available to British scientists the important work of De Candolle and other, mainly French, botanists. The book reveals how effectively Henslow had equipped himself with an all-round picture of botany as an important science, but already, by 1832, when he obtained the living of Cholsey-cum-Moulsford in Berkshire, the Cambridge halcyon days were nearly over. The new vicar of Cholsey resided in the village during the long vacation, but continued to live in Cambridge until 1839. In 1837 he accepted the lucrative living of Hitcham in Suffolk, but soon decided that he could not conscientiously discharge his duties there without leaving Cambridge. From 1839 onwards he attended to his minimum commitments in Cambridge, which included a lecture course in the Easter term, and an interest in the new botanic garden, which was officially opened in 1846, and which retains today many marks of Henslow's ideas. The far-sighted design of planting hardy trees in systematic groups was specifically chosen by Henslow for its educational value, and the whole purpose of the garden was explained by him in his <span class="italic">Address to the members of the University of Cambridge on the expediency of improving, and on the funds required for remodelling and supporting the botanic garden</span>. This twenty-page pamphlet, dated 1846, sets out with admirable clarity what a botanical garden should do, in providing facilities for growing plants for teaching and research. Published at a time when there was still no regular teaching in the individual sciences in Cambridge, this document reads prophetically, and it is good to recall that, the year before he died, Henslow was able to examine the first tripos candidates for botany.<br>
<br>A new career began for Henslow when the family left Cambridge for the rectory at Hitcham. He had already displayed in Cambridge an active interest in local politics, and had indeed incurred a good deal of criticism for his willingness to act as &#145;common informer&#146; in a court case involving election bribery. (As an extraordinary witness to this affair there remained visible for more than a century afterwards an inscription in thick black paint on the wall of Corpus Christi College stating &#145;Henslow&#151;common informer&#146;.) This wider concern for the good of &#145;the common people&#146; Henslow increasingly exercised in and around his Suffolk parish. In spite of opposition, sometimes quite violent, among the local farmers, who saw in any education of the labouring classes a dangerous, even revolutionary step, he established schools, benefit and sports clubs, allotments, horticultural shows, and parish excursions. One of these excursions, held on 27 July 1854, took more than 200 parishioners by the newly constructed railway for a day visit to Cambridge, where, on a carefully planned itinerary, they were shown the new botanic garden and several colleges and university buildings, and taken to dinner at 2 p.m. in the hall of Downing College where, according to a pamphlet he had printed about the visit, &#145;the Vice-Chancellor and his Lady have kindly added to our ordinary frugal fare by the present of a Barrel of Beer, and Plum-puddings enough for the whole party&#146;.<br>
<br>The fame of Henslow's experiments in popular education reached far beyond Hitcham, and he was even invited by Prince Albert to give a short course of botanical lectures to the royal children. He made an important contribution to the development of scientific teaching in the University of London, where he acted as an examiner for twenty-two years, and pioneered the introduction of a practical examination. Henslow was also involved with the early years of the Ipswich Museum, acting as president of the managing committee from 1850.<br>
<br>Henslow and his wife had three daughters, and three sons of whom one died in infancy. The eldest daughter, Frances, married the botanist J. D. Hooker (1817&#150;1911) and the younger son, George Henslow, became a popular botanical lecturer. Harriet Henslow died on 20 November 1857. Henslow died at the rectory, Hitcham, on 16 May 1861, and of his funeral at Hitcham on 22 May, Jenyns records that &#145;church and churchyard alike [were] filled with the parishioners&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54093"></a><span class="headword">George Henslow</span>  (1835&#150;1925), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 23 March 1835 in Cambridge. He was educated privately at the vicarage at Sawston, near Cambridge, then at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Bury St Edmunds. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1854 and graduated in 1858 with a first class in the natural sciences tripos together with a second class in both mathematics and divinity. After ordination his first curacy was at Steyning, Sussex, from 1859 to 1861, followed by two consecutive appointments as headmaster of grammar schools at Hampton Lucy, Warwickshire, and London (Store Street). From 1886 to 1890 he held the lectureship in botany at St Bartholomew's medical school, and was honorary professor of botany to the Royal Horticultural Society from 1880 to 1918. In 1897 he was appointed one of the original sixty holders of the horticultural society's Victoria medal of honour. Henslow was married three times. In October 1859 he married Ellen Weekley (<i>d</i>. 1871); the couple had five children, but only one (also George), survived infancy. In 1872 he married Georgina Brook Bailey (1842/3&#150;1876); following her death he married, in 1881, Katherine (1845/6&#150;1919), widow of Richard Yeo.<br>
<br>A large man with an impressive bearing, Henslow was an excellent lecturer, very popular with amateur gardeners and naturalists. His lectures were illustrated with large coloured wall-diagrams, many of which came to him from his father, who had used them in his own lectures in Cambridge. Though accepting the general idea of organic evolution, George Henslow found Darwinian natural selection unconvincing as a mechanism, preferring Lamarckian explanations as in his books <span class="italic">The Origin of Floral Structures</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">The Origin of Plant Structures</span> (1895). These views, combined with a somewhat authoritarian manner, made him less universally acceptable in scientific bodies such as the Linnean Society of London, of which he was a fellow. Henslow died at his home, Danehurst, 40 Branksome Wood Road, Bournemouth, on 30 December 1925 and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.<br>
