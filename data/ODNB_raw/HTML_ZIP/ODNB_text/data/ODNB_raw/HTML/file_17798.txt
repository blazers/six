<span class="headword">Mahon,  James Patrick</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em> the O'Gorman Mahon]</span>  (1800&#150;1891), <span class="occ">politician and financial speculator</span>, was born into a prominent Catholic family at Ennis, co. Clare, on about 17 March 1800, the eldest of four children. His father, Patrick Mahon of New Park (<i>d</i>. 1821), who took part in the rising of 1798, inherited an estate in co. Clare. His mother, Barbara, a considerable heiress, was the only daughter of James O'Gorman of Ennis. Mahon was one of the earliest pupils at Clongowes Wood College, where he was a contemporary of Maurice, eldest son of Daniel O'Connell. After school he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he took his BA in 1822 and proceeded MA in law in 1832. Until his father's death in 1821, he was sent an annual allowance of &pound;500; afterwards, he inherited half the family property, becoming also a magistrate for co. Clare. A tall, striking man, he cut an impressive figure at Trinity and then in the Dublin social scene. He adopted at this time the style the O'Gorman Mahon, a conjunction of his parental surnames. He became acquainted with Tom Steele and through him joined the Catholic Association. He was called to the Irish bar in 1834, but never practised. Mahon was instrumental in convincing O'Connell to contest the by-election for County Clare against William Vesey Fitzgerald in 1828, and played a conspicuous part in the ensuing electoral campaign that contributed directly to the Wellington ministry's concession of Catholic emancipation in the following year. As his obituary in the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> (17 June 1891) observed, his<blockquote>political career could not have opened more brilliantly or with such promise of success in Ireland, where courage and daring, youth and comeliness, physical strength, a noble Irish name, and eloquence&#151;qualities and gifts possessed by The O'Gorman Mahon&#151;are so much admired.</blockquote>In 1830 Mahon married Christina, daughter of John O'Brien of Dublin. She was an heiress and had property valued at &pound;60,000 in her own right, which gave Mahon the resources to seek parliamentary honours. The couple spent little time together, and she died apart from him, in Paris in 1877. They had one son, St John, who died on 22 September 1883. Mahon was returned for County Clare at the general election of 1830 but was unseated on petition on a charge of bribery. During the election he quarrelled with O'Connell, causing a rift which never healed. At the next general election in 1831, he was easily outdistanced by Major M'Namara and Maurice O'Connell in the race for the representation of County Clare, a struggle that further estranged him from O'Connell senior. Between 1831 and 1835 he resided chiefly at Mahonburgh, becoming a deputy lieutenant of his county, and a captain in the West Clare militia. His most fruitful political period was at an end.<br>
<br>In 1835 Mahon began the travels which gave him a quixotic aura. First he went to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Talleyrand and became a favourite at the court of Louis-Philippe. From Paris he proceeded to several European capitals, travelled in Africa and the East, and was for a short time in South America before returning to Ireland in 1846. He was returned unopposed for Ennis in the general election of 1847. His political leanings were unclear; he made no mention of repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in his election address, terming himself a whig and pledging to follow Lord John Russell. He lost favour in Ireland by supporting Russell's measures against the Young Irelanders, for whom he had no sympathy, in 1848 and because of his subsequent abstention on the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles bill</span> of 1851. However, in Dod's <span class="italic">Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1850) he affirmed his support for repeal. During this period he made a wide circle of acquaintances in London, including the author William Thackeray. His spendthrift habits depleted his financial resources and in 1851 he was forced to sell most of his co. Clare estates. At the next general election, in July 1852, his attempt to be re-elected for Ennis ended in failure.<br>
<br>On leaving parliament, Mahon was soon off on his foreign travels once more. As earlier, the details are only partially verifiable, and depend upon his own recollections. Reportedly, he returned to Paris, where he was involved in financial, literary, and journalistic projects; proceeded to St Petersburg, where the tsar appointed him a lieutenant in his international bodyguard; subsequently, he hunted bear in Finland with the tsarevich, fought against the Tartars, travelled in China and India, and served under the Turkish and Austrian flags. He went to South America in late 1858 and returned to Europe in late summer 1861. Meanwhile his financial situation worsened. During the next years he moved about extensively, allegedly serving as a general in the government forces during the civil war in Uruguay, commanding a Chilean fleet in the war with Spain, serving as a colonel under the emperor of Brazil, and fighting for the Union in the American Civil War. On returning once more to Paris, in 1866, Louis Napoleon made him a colonel in a regiment of chasseurs. He then, in 1867, went to Berlin, where he established close relations with Bismarck and the crown prince as well as mixing widely in society. During this time he was again plagued by debts and sought to repair his finances through speculative ventures.<br>
<br>Mahon reappeared in Ireland in 1871 and by the next year business liabilities brought him to the verge of bankruptcy. As a consequence of his dealings, he ended up before the central criminal court in London but was acquitted. He then took part in the national conference in November 1873 which established the Irish Home Rule League. His ambition to re-enter parliament was rekindled. At the general election of 1874 he unsuccessfully contested Ennis as a home-ruler and he was defeated in the County Clare by-election on 13 August 1877, when he again stood as a supporter of Irish self-government. Persistence was rewarded when Mahon captured the County Clare seat at a by-election on 15 May 1879, then came at the head of the poll in the same constituency at the general election of 1880. He was a popular figure even with those who differed with his politics. He nominated Charles Stewart Parnell for the chairmanship of the Home Rule Party in 1880 and remained on cordial terms with the Irish leader. He introduced Captain O'Shea to Parnell and acted as an informal channel of communication with the government in 1882, when the Irish leader was in Kilmainham prison. Despite being a nationalist, Mahon sometimes refused to follow party directives and voted with the Liberal government. His independence of mind and whiggish politics made him unacceptable as a nationalist parliamentary candidate in 1885, but Parnell restored him to the House of Commons when the seat at Carlow fell vacant in August 1887. Even then, he insisted upon standing as a Liberal home-ruler and was not obliged to take the party pledge. He retained this seat until his death at his home, 12 Sydney Street, South Kensington, London, on 15 June 1891. Almost his last act was to repudiate Parnell's leadership during the divorce crisis.<br>
<br>Mahon's dashing reputation was enhanced by his fame with the duelling pistol. Precise details are elusive but he may have participated in between thirteen to eighteen affairs of honour. It is known that he once sent Parnell his card though the difference of opinion was patched up and the Irish chief bore him no grudge, either then or after being abandoned by Mahon over the divorce crisis. Indeed, Parnell attended Mahon's funeral and burial at Glasnevin cemetery, within the O'Connell circle, on 21 June 1891.<br>
