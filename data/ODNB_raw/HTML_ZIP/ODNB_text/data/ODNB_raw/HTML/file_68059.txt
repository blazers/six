<span class="headword">Hatton,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Hatton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Lady Elizabeth Cecil; <em>other married name </em> Elizabeth Coke, Lady Coke]</span>  (1578&#150;1646), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4981/', "Thomas Cecil, first earl of Exeter (1542&#150;1623)")</script>, and Dorothy Neville (1548&#150;1609), daughter of Lord Latimer. In the early 1590s she married Sir William Hatton (formerly Newport), who died in 1597, bequeathing her Corfe Castle, the Isle of Purbeck, Hatton House in Holborn, and the care of her stepdaughter, Frances Hatton. On 6 November 1598 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5826/', "Sir Edward Coke (1552&#150;1634)")</script>, a lawyer, who had ten children by his previous marriage, and they had two daughters, Frances and Elizabeth. She was popular at court, performing with the queen as one of the goddesses in the masque <span class="italic">The Vision of Twelve Goddesses</span> (1604), and was well known for her lavish and lively entertainments at Hatton House. Jonson's masque <span class="italic">The Hue and Cry after Cupid</span> (1608) commended her as one of the loveliest court ladies. In 1621 she was one of the select members of the audience directly addressed by one of the Gypsies in Jonson's <span class="italic">The Gypsies Metamorphosed</span> (1640):<blockquote>
<div>Others' fortunes may be showne<br>
</div>
<div>You are the builder of your owne<br>
</div> (p. 71)</blockquote>exemplifying her reputation as an independent, forceful, and powerful woman. She corresponded with Elizabeth of Bohemia and visited her in exile at The Hague in 1627.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's marriage to Edward Coke was difficult. She initiated several legal actions against his appropriation of lands and revenue inherited from her first husband, in 1617 and after Coke's death in 1634. The 1634 text of her petition to the privy council outlines their financial disagreements, claiming Coke refused her maintenance and used profits from her lands to advance the children of his first marriage. Lady Hatton's resistance to the view that a husband owned his wife's property displays her strong, intelligent, and independent temperament, exemplifying how powerful married women conceived of their property, and the fight they faced to retain it. In 1600 she left him for at least a year, using her connections with influential men to force Coke to grant her an annual allowance. She refused to take his name, continuing to use &#145;Lady Hatton&#146;, and for most of their marriage they lived apart. In 1617 she petitioned the council for her assets, condemning his appropriation of land, revenue, and a mortgage. Chamberlain described her performance before the council: &#145;divers said Burbage could not have acted better&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, vol. xcii, no.42). The dispute was settled by negotiation.<br>
<br>Coke treated his wife's daughters as he did her property. In 1605 he forced the marriage of her stepdaughter Frances Hatton to Sir Robert Rich. The marriage of Coke's and Hatton's own daughter, Frances Coke, to Sir John Villiers, George Villiers's brother, is renowned. Coke negotiated the details, to which neither mother nor daughter were party, in 1617. Lady Hatton removed her daughter, but Coke obtained a warrant, forcing entry to obtain her. Francis Bacon, then lord keeper, was petitioned by Lady Hatton, who described herself as &#145;like a cow that has lost a calf&#146;  (Spedding, 4.225). He ruled that both parents' consent was needed (given Frances was heir to her mother's estates), ordering Coke to return Frances to her mother. Lady Hatton agreed to the marriage on terms ensuring her daughter an income, but Frances's life with Villiers was unhappy and she was arraigned for adultery in 1627. Lady Hatton provided equivocal support for her daughter, but did leave her estate to her son.<br>
<br>Hatton was actively involved in the financial management of her estates: there are records of disputes about leases for Hatton House and about access over her land. Her will gives precise details of the disposal and care of her properties and large bequests for poor relief in Holborn and Stoke Poges. During the civil war she supported parliament. She died on 3 January 1646 and was buried in St Andrew's parish church in Holborn. There is no monument, despite a request in her will that one be erected to her there; the exigencies of the civil war may explain its absence.<br>
