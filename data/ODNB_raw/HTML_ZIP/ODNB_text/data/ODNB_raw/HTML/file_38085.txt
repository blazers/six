</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vale,  Samuel</span>  (1797&#150;1848), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 3 October 1797 in London, where his father was the proprietor of a toy shop. After finishing school he was placed in his father's shop, but was soon attracted to the theatre on seeing Edmund Kean perform at Drury Lane. In opposition to his father's wishes he began to study drama, and in 1813 he ran away from home and joined a small company under Harrison at Leatherhead.<br>
<br>Under the name Dornton (after the hero of Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>), he made his stage d&eacute;but at the age of seventeen, playing Realize in <span class="italic">The Will</span>; the attempt was a failure, and again he ran away to try his luck by turns in Worthing, Arundel, and Portsmouth. After reaching Gosport he was first taken on by Nicholson to play&#151;not very successfully&#151;a long part in <span class="italic">The Fishermen of Baghdad</span>, and was then offered an engagement in 1815 by Thornton at Arundel. Now he dropped the name Dornton, and as Mr Brown played the first successful role of his career, Montalban in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span>, to the Juliana of Elizabeth Edwin. After this he steadily rose in popularity until his own father came to see him act (Count Virolet in Colman's <span class="italic">The Mountaineers</span> and Charles in <span class="italic">The Village Lawyer</span>) and was forced to acknowledge his son's talents in his chosen career. A reconciliation followed, and Vale took an engagement under Henry at Minehead, Somerset, playing, <i>inter alia</i>, Young Norval, Selim in <span class="italic">Blue Beard</span>, and Young Malcolm. He then moved to Fisher's Exeter circuit, now using the name Vincent, and remained with the company for eighteen months. At Torquay he became very popular playing in <span class="italic">John Bull, or, An Englishman's Fireside</span>, and <span class="italic">The Review, or, Jack of All Trades</span>. In January 1819 he used his own name for the first time when he opened in Norwich as Careless in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. He remained on the Norwich circuit for two years, and then joined Crisp's Cheltenham circuit, touring Cheltenham, Worcester, and Ludlow.<br>
<br>In October 1820 Vale made his London d&eacute;but, as Buckingham in <span class="italic">Rochester</span>, at the Olympic under Barlow and Reeve; Vale's father had apparently exerted his influence to get the engagement for his son. At the end of the season, however, he retired to the provinces once more, and played Hawthorn to the Rosetta of Maria Tree at Cheltenham. Perhaps his most successful role in this period was Nicholas Twill in <span class="italic">Too Late for Dinner</span>, also at Cheltenham. He was back at the Olympic as Logic in <span class="italic">Tom and Jerry</span> in October 1821, then migrated to Sadler's Wells under Egerton. He also performed at the Surrey, and is said to have sung &#145;The Good Old Days of Adam and Eve&#146; at least 500 times.<br>
<br>Vale achieved prominence on the London stage between 1831 and 1848, when he first took the part of Simon Spatterdash in Samuel Beazley's musical farce <span class="italic">The Boarding House, or, Five Hours at Brighton</span>, a role with which his name became closely identified. It prompted &#145;Sam Valerisms&#146;, idiosyncratic and illogical verbal comparisons&#151;&#145;&#147;Why here we are all mustarded&#148;, as the roast beef said to the Welsh rabbit&#146; and &#145;&#147;When a man is ashamed to show the front of his face let him turn around and show the back of it&#148;, as the turnstile said to the weather-cock&#146;&#151;for which Vale is remembered today, immortalized by Charles Dickens as Sam Weller in <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span> (1836).<br>
<br>Vale went on to play many parts at the Royal Coburg Theatre and at the Surrey, his most popular role at the latter house being Dummie Dunnaker in Ben Webster's version of <span class="italic">Paul Clifford, or, The Highwayman of 1770</span> (1832). In 1835 he joined D. W. Osbaldiston's company at Covent Garden, where he remained until 1837, playing in popular burlettas. Vale continued to act for the rest of his life, but the latter part of his career was undistinguished by any significant achievement. He died on 3 March 1848.<br>
