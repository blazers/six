<span class="headword">Conduitt,  John</span>  (1688&#150;1737), <span class="occ">politician</span>, of Cranbury Park in Hampshire, was the son of Leonard and Sarah Conduitt, and was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 8 March 1688. He was admitted into Westminster School as a king's scholar in June 1701, and in June 1705 matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge. After leaving the university he travelled in Europe. In 1711 he was judge-advocate with the British forces in Portugal, and in the following year he was made captain in a regiment of dragoons serving in that country. On 26 August 1717 he married Catherine Barton (<i>d</i>. 1739), the niece of Sir Isaac Newton and the reputed mistress of the late Charles Montagu, earl of Halifax. The couple had one daughter.<br>
<br>In June 1721 Conduitt was elected, on petition, whig member for Whitchurch, Hampshire, which he represented during the 1720s as a loyal supporter of Walpole's government. At this time he was also performing the duties of master of the Royal Mint for his wife's uncle, and on Newton's death on 20 March 1727 Conduitt succeeded him in this position. Soon after, Conduitt drew up a memorial sketch for Fontenelle, who was producing Newton's eulogy for the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences. The finished work was not satisfactory to Conduitt, who criticized Fontenelle for having &#145;neither abilities nor inclination to do justice to that great man, who has eclipsed the glory of their hero, Descartes&#146;. He resolved to write Newton's life and began to gather information. Though the biography was never written, Conduitt collected a wealth of material, including Newton's famous comparison of himself to &#145;a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me&#146;.<br>
<br>In his post at the mint Conduitt wrote the clear and much praised <span class="italic">Observations on the Present State of our Gold and Silver Coins</span> (1730), posthumously published in 1774. The chief objects of the memoir, drawn up at a time when gold was falling in value and silver rising, were to advocate the coinage of the latter metal in preference to the former, and to recommend a reduction in the weight of the silver currency.<br>
<br>By the early 1730s Conduitt had become a relatively prominent parliamentary speaker, defending the government on a number of issues, including Walpole's maintenance of the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>. In 1734 he was re-elected to his seat but chose to represent Southampton. Two years later (12 January 1736) he introduced a successful bill repealing an early seventeenth-century act against conjuration and witchcraft. He died on 23 May 1737 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on the right-hand side of Sir Isaac Newton. His wife, Catherine, who died in 1739, was buried with him. Their daughter married on 8 July 1740 Viscount Lymington, the eldest son of the first earl of Portsmouth; their son succeeded as second earl of Portsmouth.<br>
