<span class="headword">Baldwin, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>before 1470, <em>d.</em> 1545), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born shortly before 1470, a younger son of William Baldwin (<i>d</i>. 1479?) of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and Agnes, daughter of William Dormer of Wycombe in the same county. William's brother, John Baldwin (<i>d</i>. 1469), was a bencher of Gray's Inn and common serjeant of the city of London. The Aylesbury estates had been left to William by the common serjeant, and were inherited by the younger John from his brother Richard in 1484. John joined the Inner Temple, but the details of his career there suggest that he cannot have been admitted much before 1500, and it is not clear how he spent his earlier years. The identity of his first wife is also uncertain, but she was probably called Agnes and was the mother of his only son and three daughters. She died before 1518, when he married Anne, daughter of Sir William Norris MP (<i>d</i>. 1506) of Yattendon, Berkshire, and widow of William Wroughton. Anne, however, became insane before her husband's death.<br>
<br>John Baldwin is mentioned as counsel in the court of requests in 1506, and by 1510 was a justice of the peace for Buckinghamshire. Thereafter his rise was steady. He gave his first reading in the Inner Temple in 1516, and served as its treasurer from 1521 to 1523, in which latter year the subsidy commissioners rated him as being worth &pound;133 in goods. In 1529 he was elected member of parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, and the following year became attorney-general for Wales and the duchy of Cornwall. When he was nominated for the coif in 1531, he delivered a third reading in the Inner Temple, on the statute <span class="italic">De prisonam frangentibus</span>, a text of which survives in BL, Harley MS 1691. Upon his creation he was appointed a king's serjeant, together with his brother bencher Thomas Audley, and three years later was knighted, an honour that Spelman noted as unprecedented for a serjeant. Following the death of Robert Norwich he was selected (presumably by Audley) to be chief justice of the common pleas, and was appointed on 19 April 1535.<br>
<br>The printed year-books come to an end in 1535, and what little is known of Baldwin's judicial career is mostly derived from Dyer's reports. Dyer was not wholly complimentary, noting of a case in 1538 that neither he nor anyone else understood Baldwin's dissenting opinion. Spelman reports that Baldwin was given the task of passing sentence on the Carthusian priors in June 1535 for treason, the other judges not bothering to await the verdict. Baldwin went the Norfolk circuit until 1541, and then the home. At Bury assizes in 1538 he was an innocent party to a tragic miscarriage of justice. After a man had been tried before him and executed for murder on the evidence of his small son, it was discovered that the supposed victim was still alive and that the boy had been suborned; the case was the subject of a thorough investigation by the king's council.<br>
<br>Baldwin retained the family seat at Aylesbury, a town where he was the principal inhabitant and rebuilt the sessions house in 1538. In his later years he made numerous further land purchases in the same vicinity and elsewhere, including in 1536 an estate in Little Marlow, which provided a country home, and in 1540 the site of the Greyfriars in Aylesbury. He died in office on 24 October 1545, probably at Marlow, and was buried in Aylesbury church. His daughter Alice (the last abbess of Burnham), who died a few months later, directed her executor to erect a marble tomb with pictures of her parents and their children, and &#145;such epitaff or scripture as he shall thinke convyent&#146;; but it is not known whether this was done. Baldwin's son William was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1525 but died in 1538, and so after the death of Alice the inheritance was shared between his two remaining daughters, Agnes and Pernel. The Aylesbury estate descended to Sir Thomas Pakington (<i>d</i>. 1571), son of Agnes and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96818/', "Robert Pakington MP")</script> (assassinated in 1536), and the Little Marlow estate to John Burlace MP (<i>d</i>. 1593), son of Pernel and Edward Burlace (<i>d</i>. 1544). It was to Burlace that the chief justice left all his law books.<br>
