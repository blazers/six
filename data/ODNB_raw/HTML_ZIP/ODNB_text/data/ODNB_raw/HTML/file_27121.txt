<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  William</span>  (1554/5&#150;1627), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was a son of Anthony Temple (<i>d</i>. 1581) and grandson of Peter Temple of Derset and Butlers Marston, Warwickshire. He was educated at Eton College, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he gained a scholarship. After entering King's in 1573 he was elected a fellow by 1576 and graduated BA in the following year, receiving his MA by 1581. Temple supplicated for incorporation as MA at Oxford on 11 July 1581.<br>
<br>Temple quickly made a name for himself as a follower of the logical teachings of Petrus Ramus (Pierre de la Ram&eacute;e), and his adherence to the controversial Ramist &#145;method&#146; soon led him into a polemical battle with Everard Digby, a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, who published a defence of Aristotelianism, the <span class="italic">Theoria analytica</span>, in 1579. Digby followed this treatise by an even more contentious work of 1580, <span class="italic">De duplici methodo</span>, which attacked the Ramist revision of dialectical method. It proved the first in a pamphlet war and was quickly followed by Temple's <span class="italic">Ad Everardum Digbeium Anglum admonitio de unica P. Rami methodo reiectis ceteris retinendis</span> (1580), written under the pseudonym of Franciscus Mildapettus of Navarre&#151;in reference to Ramus's connection with the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre. The third pamphlet in 1580 was a rejoinder by Digby: <span class="italic">Everardi Digbei Cantabrigiensis admonitioni Francisci Mildapetti</span>, entered in the Stationers' register for 3 November. This in turn occasioned Temple's <span class="italic">Pro Mildapetti de unica methodo defensione contra diplodophilum commentatio</span> (1581), which ended the correspondence between the two.<h2>
<a name="TheRamistdebate15801584"></a>The Ramist debate, 1580&#150;1584</h2>The core of the debate lay in the Ramist redefinition of dialectic in the sixteenth century. Ramus transferred two parts of Ciceronian rhetoric&#151;invention and disposition&#151;to dialectic. By thus placing the finding and arrangement of arguments in dialectic, rather than rhetoric, Ramus and his followers undermined current trends in Aristotelian logic. Likewise their emphasis on a single method, applicable to all subjects, which was based on division into dichotomies, challenged the Aristotelian double method. Digby spent much of his initial pamphlet on the various types of double method one could find in a repetitious critique of the Ramist single method. Temple was quick in his <span class="italic">Admonitio</span> to demonstrate how deeply indebted Digby was to the scholastic method. In his dedicatory epistle to his patron, Philip Howard, first earl of Arundel, he decried the decline of dialectic and in typical humanist fashion outlined the history of the decline with copious reference to Aristotelian commentators, rather than Aristotle himself&#151;a favourite humanist argument. In his view, dialectic should no longer be thought of as a subject solely of use in the schools but rather its true application to everyday life beyond the ivory towers was lauded. Since Ramist dialectic, with its rhetorical semblance, was essentially concerned with persuasion, Temple argued that it would be vitally useful in all areas of political and social life.<br>
<br>The acrimony of the dispute was not only engendered by the generational conflict involved (Temple was younger than Digby), but was also exacerbated by the differing religious affiliations of the main protagonists. Temple, as his later career demonstrates, was very much a moderate puritan. Digby, on the other hand, became embroiled in a controversy concerning his religious outlook in the later 1580s, when William Whitaker, master of St John's College, argued for his deprivation from his fellowship on the grounds that he was a suspected Catholic and eventually won, forcing Digby to leave St John's. Though it seems unlikely that Digby was indeed Catholic his interpretation of theological doctrines of predestination was in direct conflict with those of the puritan wing of the Church of England.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Pro Mildapetti</span> Temple was not content to attack Digby but produced a thoroughgoing defence of Ramism. An English translation of the title of this work demonstrates its scope: <span class="italic">A dissertation of William Temple of King's College, Cambridge, on behalf of a defense of Mildapet concerning the unipartite method, directed against the lover of the double way, to which is added an explanation of some questions in physics and ethics, along with a letter concerning the dialectic of Ramus, addressed to Johannes Piscator of Strasbourg</span>. His section on physics, primarily concerned with its relationship with logic, was directed against George Liebler, a professor of natural philosophy at T&uuml;bingen, who advocated the Aristotelian method. More extensive attacks were launched on Theodore Zwinger's interpretations of Aristotelian ethics and Johann Piscator's logical investigations, thus extending the debate to include authors who tried to hold the middle ground in the war between Ramus and Aristotle. However, the main target was the German theologian and teacher Piscator, who was Calvinist and based in Strasbourg, but also had links with Herborn and Wittenberg. Temple's debate with Piscator proved lucrative for a number of printers. The W&eacute;chel press in particular played a part in bringing it to a wider audience by publishing in 1582 an edition of Piscator's <span class="italic">Animadversiones</span> (republished by them in 1583, 1586, 1587, and 1593). In the same year the W&eacute;chels also produced an edition of Temple's <span class="italic">Epistola de dialectica</span>. The W&eacute;chel press also published other works connected with Temple's interventions in the Ramist debate. He continued his critique of Aristotelian physics in 1584 by writing a preface for a pro-Ramist work by James Martin of Dunkeld, Perthshire, whose book <span class="italic">De prima simplicium et concretorum corporum generatione disputatio</span>, first published in England at Cambridge in 1584, was republished by the W&eacute;chels in 1589. Again, Temple in fact demonstrated more interest in logic than in physics itself, contenting himself with a denunciation of Aristotelian physics and a strong recommendation of Ramist-style contemporary commentators. Both treatise and preface elicited a response from Andreas Libavius who, like Piscator, attempted to take a moderate stance in the current Aristotelian&#150;Ramist conflict.<br>
<br>Temple continued his debate with Piscator in an important work of 1584: <span class="italic">P. Rami dialecticae libri duo, scholiis G. Tempelli Cantabrigiensis illustrati</span>, published at Cambridge and later at Frankfurt in 1591. Along with this extensive commentary on the Latin text of Ramus's <span class="italic">Dialecticae libri duo</span>, the work contained not only Temple's condemnation of Piscator's theories grouped under twenty-nine heads, but also an attack on Porphyry, the author of the <span class="italic">Isagoge</span>, a well-known introductory text to Aristotelian logic. The themes of the pamphlets were continued in this work which, yet again, advocated the Ramist single method in no uncertain terms. James Mullinger exaggerated the importance of this work, the first English edition of the Latin text for eight years, by claiming that it was &#145;probably in the possession of every Cambridge scholar&#146;&#151;an assertion not supported by the findings of the university inventory lists  (Mullinger, 406). The consequences of Temple's decision to address the dedication to Sir Philip Sidney were to radically transform his life, leading him away from his former educational appointments at King's (where he ceased to be fellow in 1583) and as headmaster of the Lincoln free school (from the early 1580s), to become secretary to a number of extremely influential men in late Elizabethan England.<h2>
<a name="Publiccareer15851609"></a>Public career, 1585&#150;1609</h2>Sidney's contacts with the W&eacute;chels may have made him an even more attractive potential patron to Temple. In November 1585 Temple was appointed Sidney's secretary. He travelled with him to the Low Countries following Sidney's appointment as governor of Flushing. This pleasant working relationship was terminated only on 17 October 1586, when Sidney died in Temple's arms as a result of injuries received at the battle of Zutphen on 22 September. He left his secretary &pound;30 a year in his will. Temple, in his turn, wrote a number of elegies in the Cambridge memorial volume for Sidney. A more fitting tribute to Sidney was Temple's unpublished Ramist commentary on the former's <span class="italic">An Apologie for Poetrie</span> (1595)&#151;the <span class="italic">Analysis tractationis de poesi contextae a nobilissimo viro Philippo Sidneio equite aurato</span>. Internal evidence suggests that this work was written prior to Sidney's death, possibly early in Temple's employment. Described by a modern commentator as &#145;an outstanding example of Tudor practical criticism&#146;  (Webster, 11), it demonstrates how texts were read using a Ramist schema.<br>
<br>On Sidney's death Temple found employment with William Davison, principal secretary, and then with Sir Thomas Smith, clerk of the privy council. From 1594 to 1601 he was secretary to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, and through his influence was elected as MP for Tamworth, Warwickshire, in 1597. Though previously it has been suggested that he may have travelled to Ireland with Essex in 1599, comments in a later work indicate that he did not accompany the earl. His association with Essex proved a liability following the earl's plot to overthrow Elizabeth I in 1601, and though Temple protested his innocence he failed to convince Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary. For some years Temple was cast out into a political wilderness and despite his dedication of his 1605 work on the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> to Henry, prince of Wales, he remained in obscurity until his elevation as provost of Trinity College, Dublin, in November 1609. Some time before 1600 he married Martha (<i>d</i>. in or after 1627), daughter of Robert Harrison of Derbyshire; they had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27114/', "Sir John Temple (1600&#150;1677)")</script>, and three daughters.<h2>
<a name="ProvostofTrinityCollegeDublin16091627"></a>Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, 1609&#150;1627</h2>Temple's appointment as provost may well have been on the strength of his <span class="italic">Logicall Analysis of Twentye Select Psalmes Performed by W. Temple</span> (1605), which, with the more extensive Latin version of 1611, <span class="italic">Analysis logica triginta psalmorum</span>, proved to be the last of his published works. The vice-chancellor of Trinity, Luke Challoner, with James Ussher, professor of theological controversies, may well have felt that the application of Ramist themes to theology accorded well with what they were attempting to do in the Dublin college. Inherent in the work, and indeed in the 1611 edition, which Temple judiciously dedicated to the first earl of Salisbury (Cecil), was his theological leaning towards a moderate puritan position, which would also have recommended him to the establishment at Trinity. His puritan stance was equally evident in his dealings with George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, when the latter remonstrated with Temple in 1613 over the self-evident puritanism at Trinity. Temple's defence of Trinity at this point, coupled with his obvious dislike of the use of surplices within the college, strengthens today's perception of him as a moderate puritan. In memoranda on the subject he asserted repeatedly his conformist nature but it is equally clear that his view of the matter differed markedly from that of Abbot.<br>
<br>As provost Temple proved an effective administrator, at least in his first years in the post, travelling to England in 1616 on college business. He produced the first set of statutes, now unfortunately only partially extant, and responded to the increasing growth of the college by regulating the position of officers. His decision to divide the fellows into two groups&#151;senior fellows, with voting rights, and junior fellows, who had no say in the election of the provost&#151;was to prove controversial, as indeed was his tendency to appoint family members to lucrative posts. By the last year of his provostship there was widespread discontent within the college, particularly with his policy concerning the disposal of college lands in Ulster, and following his death attempts were made to recover college revenues from his widow. Given that as a layman Temple could not avail himself of the preaching positions that usually helped finance the office of provost, he was forced to augment his salary by taking political positions. By 1610 he had been made a master in chancery and in the 1614 parliament he held the seat for Dublin University. He was knighted on 4 May 1622 by the lord deputy, Sir Oliver St John, for his activity in Irish politics. Temple wrote his will on 21 December 1626, and died at Trinity College on 15 January 1627, aged seventy-two; he was buried in the old chapel near the provost's seat. His long reign as provost proved a crucial period in the consolidation of the new colonial college in Ireland and as the author of the first extant set of statutes his decisions proved influential for centuries to come.<br>
