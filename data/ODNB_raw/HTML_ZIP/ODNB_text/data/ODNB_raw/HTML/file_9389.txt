<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Field,  John</span>  (1782&#150;1837), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 16 or 26 July 1782 in Golden Lane, Dublin, the eldest of at least seven children of Robert Field, a theatrical violinist, and his wife, Grace. He was baptized on 5 September at St Werburgh's Church. He received his musical education first from his grandfather John, who was an organist, then in 1791 from Tommaso Giordani. He made his first recorded public appearance at the Rotunda Assembly Rooms on 24 March 1792, playing a piano arrangement of a harp concerto by Mme Krumpholtz.<br>
<br>In 1793 the family moved to London, possibly spending part of the year in Bath. Robert apparently joined the orchestra at the King's Theatre, while John was apprenticed to Muzio Clementi for 100 guineas. He had music lessons from Clementi and worked for the music publishing firm of Longman and Broderip (in which Clementi had an interest) as a piano salesman and demonstrator. Field made his London d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 21 May 1793, at Miss Chapman's benefit night. The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> for 21 May announced that &#145;Master Field, a Child of nine years old, will perform a Concerto on one of Longman and Broderip's Grand Piano Forte Harpsichords&#146;, although he was in fact nearly eleven. His occasional public performances included an appearance at the benefit for distressed weavers on 12 December 1793, and a concerto at Lee's benefit on 23 May 1794. Haydn described him in his diary (in English) as &#145;a young boy, which plays the pianoforte Extremely well&#146;  (Landon, 3, 309), and Thomas Holcroft called him &#145;a youth of genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 253). Field may also have studied the violin with J. P. Salomon, as a fellow pupil of Pinto. Certainly Field played a piano concerto by Dussek at Pinto's benefit on 3 May 1798, and together Field and Pinto played a sonata concertante for piano and violin at Salomon's benefit on 10 March 1800.<br>
<br>Field gave the premi&egrave;re of his first piano concerto at the King's Theatre on 7 February 1799, &#145;composed for the occasion&#146; of a benefit for the New Musical Fund, according to that day's <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> on 9 February praised the work as &#145;the chief source of admiration&#146; at the concert, &#145;calculated to display rapidity of execution, attended with characteristic musical expression&#146;, and deemed Field himself to be &#145;one of the finest performers in this kingdom&#146;. The oboist William Parke, however, considered Field's playing to be &#145;more remarkable for rapidity than expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Musical Memoirs</span>, 1, 290). The concerto was not published until 1815.<br>
<br>After his apprenticeship expired, Field was in great demand as a pianist, and he made at least eighteen appearances in the 1800 and 1801 seasons. His own students included Charles Neate, who performed at the oratorios in 1800 and became a professional musician. In 1801 Field published his sonatas, op. 1, which he dedicated to Clementi. Like his earlier works, published anonymously by Clementi, they give no hint of Field's mature style. They are classical in form, competent and polished, but lack the delicacy and expressivity of the later nocturnes.<br>
<br>In 1802 Field accompanied Clementi on a European tour, stopping in Paris, Vienna, and St Petersburg. According to the composer Louis Spohr, Clementi was less than generous with Field, who was &#145;obliged to pay for the good fortune of having his instruction, with many privations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 40). When Clementi left St Petersburg in the summer of 1803, Field stayed on, possibly to escape from Clementi's parsimoniousness, but more probably as Clementi's representative in marketing pianos and music publications. He lived at the house of his patron, General Marklovsky, for most of 1803. He made his public d&eacute;but in March 1804 and rapidly became fashionable, in demand at private concerts and as a teacher. In 1805&#150;6 he toured in the north, and on 2 March 1806 he made his Moscow d&eacute;but.<br>
<br>During this time Field developed the genre that he eventually called the nocturne and for which he became renowned throughout Europe. The nocturne is a one-movement piece characterized by a dreamy atmosphere but with no specific programme, fulfilling the Romantic belief that music can express emotions inexpressible by words. The piano texture is distinctive, with a right-hand melody above a widespaced left-hand accompaniment in which use of the pedal is essential in order to sustain the bass. Field's first three nocturnes were published in 1812, marking the beginning of his most active ten years of publishing. He often published works years after their composition and sometimes after substantial revisions, thus making their chronology hard to establish.<br>
<br>Contemporary descriptions indicate that Field designed the nocturne for his own style of performance, which was notable for a light touch and expressiveness and an avoidance of big gestures, giving an impression of being enclosed in a private world.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1810 Field married Adelaide Victoria Percheron, daughter of the war commissioner of the French fleet; she was one of his Moscow pupils and had been his mistress since 1807. Their son, Adrien, was born in 1819, shortly before they separated. Adelaide became a piano teacher in Smolensk and died in 1869. Meanwhile Field had had an affair with a Mlle Charpentier; they had an illegitimate son, Leon, in 1815.<br>
<br>Field alternated between living in St Petersburg and Moscow for fifteen years before settling in Moscow between 1821 and 1831. In 1822 he met his rival, Hummel, who was on tour in Moscow. Field continued to teach and perform, and introduced his young son Leon to the public in 1823. His slow rate of composition was undoubtedly affected by his alcoholism. He began to suffer from cancer of the rectum, and in 1831 returned with Leon to London for medical treatment and to play for the Philharmonic Society. His performances in London and Manchester were received with only moderate enthusiasm. In London he was reunited with his mother, who died the following year. His own death had been erroneously reported in both 1828 and 1831. He met Mendelssohn and Moscheles in London, and was a mourner at Clementi's funeral on 29 March 1832.<br>
<br>Field continued his tour in 1832, performing his seventh piano concerto in Paris on Christmas day to a mixed reception. He travelled with Leon through Belgium, France, and Switzerland, to Milan in November 1833, then to Naples in early 1834. There he became seriously ill and was in hospital for nine months. The Rakhmanov family helped him travel back to Moscow via Vienna (where he gave several concerts); he arrived in September 1835. There, ravaged by cancer, he composed his last nocturnes. He died on 23 January 1837 of pneumonia and was buried on 27 January in the Vedensky cemetery.<br>
<br>Field composed more than sixty pieces, all involving the piano, and including seventeen nocturnes and seven piano concertos. Some of the larger works omit slow movements, probably because he interpolated nocturnes in his own performances. He cultivated a more brilliant style for the piano concertos, and these are dominated by the soloist's virtuoso passagework; however, they suffer from episodic structures, which can result in a chain of momentary effects rather than the build up to an effective climax. Like the nocturnes, they were inspirational for composers including Chopin and Hummel.<br>
<br>Field's music influenced those Romantic composers who believed that virtuosity was the servant of artistic sensibility, most importantly Chopin&#151;whose own nocturnes are closely related in style&#151;but also Mendelssohn and Liszt, among others. Field also influenced the Russian composers Glinka and Balakirev through his treatment of Russian folk-melodies, such as the <span class="italic">Air russe vari&eacute;</span> (1808), an early nationalistic piece. He was one of the most popular composers of the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century. He is extremely important both as a stylistic influence on Romantic pianist-composers and as a composer in his own right, despite the view earlier in the twentieth century that he was merely a precursor to Chopin.<br>
<br>After learning the piano from his father, Leon Field became a successful operatic tenor. Under the name of Leonov he made his d&eacute;but in Glinka's <span class="italic">A Life for the Tsar</span> (1836), and also sang in the premi&egrave;re of Glinka's <span class="italic">Ruslan and Lyudmila</span> (1842). He died in 1872.<br>
