<span class="headword">Perris,  (George) Herbert</span>  (1866&#150;1920), <span class="occ">journalist and peace campaigner</span>, was born on 29 January 1866 at 15 Tooke Street, Everton, Liverpool, the eldest of five children of the Revd Henry Woods Perris (1839&#150;1926), a Unitarian minister, and his wife, Ellen Partington Perris (1839&#150;1924), both of Liverpool. At sixteen, after elementary schooling at King Edward VI Commercial School in Norwich, Perris was apprenticed to a pharmaceutical chemist, but two years later joined the <span class="italic">Hull Express</span>, becoming its editor at nineteen. In 1888 he moved to London and was for ten years on <span class="italic">The Speaker</span>. On 24 July 1891 he married Mary Annie Robinson (1861&#150;1929) of Hull; they had two daughters and a son, who was killed in the First World War.<br>
<br>A founding member of the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom (1890) and a regular contributor to its journal <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>, Perris visited Russia for the first time in 1896 and, increasingly interested in the ideas and beliefs of Tolstoy, wrote <span class="italic">Leo Tolstoy: the Grand Mujik</span> (1898), a study in personal evolution. However, after a visit to Tolstoy in 1904, he dissociated himself from the principle of absolute non-resistance. He became foreign editor of the Liberal newspaper <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> from its foundation in 1906, and provided space for repeated criticism of the tsar's regime, much to its annoyance. As joint secretary to the Memorial to the Duma Committee (1906), he visited St Petersburg to discuss the memorial and to help found the Anglo-Russian Friendship Society, and became caught up in events following the Duma's dissolution.<br>
<br>Perris is principally remembered for his contribution to the cause of international peace. However he was not a pacifist in the strict sense. As a strong internationalist the prevention of war was his highest political priority, but he did not exclude the use of force in the last resort. On the one hand he campaigned for the creation and strengthening of institutions to serve peace, such as arrangements for international arbitration and the spread of democratic government, and on the other against imperialism and the international arms trade. He summarized his views in <span class="italic">A Short History of War and Peace</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">The War Traders</span> (1914). In 1896 he formed the Increased Armaments Protest Committee; in 1898 he was chairman of the press committee of W. T. Stead's Peace Crusade; he attended the first Hague peace conference (1899) and published an account of it. Thereafter, he was a regular participant at national and international peace conferences. From 1906 Perris was a prominent critic of the Liberal government's foreign policy and rearmament plans; and in 1908 he left the party to join the Labour Party over the issue of the Anglo-Russian convention. He maintained regular contacts with peace leaders in Europe and the USA (where he went three times on speaking tours), and was active in promoting international understanding; for example, in 1905 he took a leading role in fostering friendship with Germany through the Anglo-German Friendship Society, of which he was joint secretary, at a time when relations between the two countries were strained. He was editor of <span class="italic">Concord</span>, journal of the International Arbitration and Peace Association, from 1898 to 1906 and briefly again in 1914; and a member of the executive committee of the National Peace Council from its establishment in 1904. He was also active in related fields, such as the Cobden Club (secretary, 1903&#150;5), the Ethical Movement, and the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47827', "Rainbow Circle")</script>.<br>
<br>After the collapse of <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> Perris became foreign editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (1908), and in 1910 assistant editor of the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>, which he originated. This series provided specially commissioned, cheap, authoritative introductions to academic subjects for general readers, and in its first two and a half years sold over one million copies of eighty titles. In 1899 he had founded the Literary Agency of London, which was in existence until 1916; its clients included Edward Thomas, Stephen Crane, A. T. Mahon, Jean de Bloch, and Aylmer Maude.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Perris joined the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> as its correspondent with the French armies. With some of his radical friends he became a reluctant supporter of a war he believed to have been caused by unprovoked and ferocious German aggression on Belgium and France. Accordingly, defeat of the Germans was a prerequisite to a new world order, and he particularly singled out the Kaiser and the Prussian governing class as having &#145;gone mad&#146;.<br>
<br>Perris was appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1918 and made a CBE in 1919. Worn out by years of overwork he died in London at 5 Ashburn Place, Kensington, on 23 December 1920, from influenza that turned to pneumonia, contracted while he was attending a conference of the League of Nations at Geneva, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium six days later. He was a characteristic figure of his time, tireless in pursuit of what he thought right, writing, lecturing, and attending meetings, often after a day earning his living. He was a prolific writer: on his fortieth birthday he recorded having written at least 200,000 words each year since the age of twenty on matters of peace and war. His simple and clear prose style had a vigorous, memorable quality when he was moved to indignation. He loved poetry and had a gift for friendship. He was a slightly built figure, 5 feet 9 inches tall, with brown hair and hazel eyes. One of his brothers, Harry Shaw Perris (1870&#150;1933), was also a campaigner for peace, making important contributions to pacifist and radical writings, and the first full-time secretary (1908) to the National Peace Council; another brother, Ernest Alfred Perris (1874&#150;1961), was a journalist, chiefly remembered as the last editor (1918&#150;1930) of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>.<br>
