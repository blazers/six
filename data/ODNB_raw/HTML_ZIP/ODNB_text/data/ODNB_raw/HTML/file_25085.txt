<span class="headword">Senex,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1678, <em>d.</em> 1740), <span class="occ">publisher and maker of maps and globes</span>, was baptized on 24 November 1678 at Ludlow, Shropshire, the son of John Senex, gentleman, and his wife, Marie. The family does not appear to have been native to that county. In 1695 Senex was apprenticed to the London bookseller Robert Clavell. Commencing business on his own account in 1702, first from premises opposite the south portico of St Clement Danes, Strand, and then next to the Fleece tavern, Cornhill, between 1703 and 1706, Senex formed an early partnership with the map makers Jeremiah Seller and Charles Price, the successors of John Seller, a partnership also involving the manufacture and sale of navigational instruments. He continued in partnership with Price at Whites Alley, Coleman Street, from 1707 to 1710, and then moved to Fleet Street, where he remained for the rest of his life, first at premises at the Globe in Salisbury Court (initially in partnership with John Maxwell) and from 1721 at the same sign opposite the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West.<br>
<br>One of Senex's earliest publications was the first edition in English of a major treatise by Edmond Halley, <span class="italic">A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets</span> (1705), an auspicious beginning to a career that saw Senex develop into one of the most distinguished London scientific publishers of the period. Often working with William Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1724)&#151;the original publisher of Daniel Defoe's <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1719)&#151;his publications included original works, reprints of valuable earlier works (often handsomely illustrated), and translations of the leading European writers on mathematics, perspective, chemistry, optics, anatomy, and architecture. He published, <i>inter alia</i>, <span class="italic">The Motion of Water and other Fluids</span> (1718), translated by John Theophilus Desaguliers from the work of Edm&eacute; Mariotte; an augmented edition of Francis Hauksbee's <span class="italic">Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects</span> with the additional experiments demonstrating &#145;several surprizing phaenomena touching light and electricity&#146;  (1719); Sir Isaac Newton's <span class="italic">Universal Arithmetic</span> (1720); Henry Wilson's <span class="italic">Trigonometry Improv'd</span> (1720); <span class="italic">A Treatise of Painting by Leonardo da Vinci</span> (1721); Giovanni Maria Lancisi's <span class="italic">Anatomy Improv'd and Illustrated</span> (1723); Nicolas Bion's <span class="italic">The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments</span> (1723), a work augmented by Edmund Stone and one that displays Senex's own neat style of engraving to particular advantage in his depictions of the various instruments; William Whiston's <span class="italic">The Calculation of Solar Eclipses without Parallaxes</span> (1724); Edmund Stone's <span class="italic">A New Mathematical Dictionary</span> (1726); George Shelvocke's <span class="italic">A Voyage Round the World</span> (1726); and Thomas Wright's <span class="italic">The Use of Globes</span> (1740).<br>
<br>In tandem with bookselling, Senex was long concerned in the production of maps and atlases. Between 1707 and 1711 he worked with Price (and later Maxwell) on a large atlas series, issuing in 1707 broadside &#145;Proposals for a new sett of correct mapps&#146; advertising the partners as &#145;Geographers to the Queen&#146; and promising work that &#145;shall in correctness, and all other particulars, far exceed any yet done&#146;. Senex and Price subsequently went their separate ways but Senex at length produced (with Maxwell) an augmented version of these maps as <span class="italic">The English Atlas</span> (1714), the bulk of the work engraved by himself. His portable version of the road maps of John Ogilby, published as <span class="italic">An Actual Survey of All the Principal Roads of England and Wales</span> in 1719, was a popular success, staying in print for many years, while his <span class="italic">A New General Atlas</span> (1721) remains the most elegant English world atlas of the time. The <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus &amp; commercialis</span> (1728), a work to which Halley lent his assistance and the text for which is said to have been written by Defoe, featured maps drawn on a new &#145;globular&#146; projection patented in 1721, which Senex had himself devised in association with John Harris and Henry Wilson. Individual maps of particular note included Halley's &#145;A description of the passage of the shadow of the moon over England&#146; of 1715, the first printed solar eclipse map and one of the earliest scientific thematic maps. Senex produced special &#145;smoak'd glasses&#146; for observing this eclipse  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 9 April 1715) and later published similar material not only by Halley but also by Whiston and Wright. He was also involved in the production of some of the earliest large-scale county maps, including Richard Budgen's &#145;An actual survey of the county of Sussex&#146; (1723) and his own &#145;A new map of the county of Surrey laid down from an actual survey&#146; (1729&#150;30). The latter, published in association with the surveyor Richard Cushee (an apprentice of Charles Price), was surveyed in part by a novel method of releasing a nightly ball of flame from the summit of Box Hill in the autumn of 1721 and taking bearings from rockets set off at staggered intervals from surrounding hills. His large map of the British Isles in nine sheets is known only in one surviving example (Newberry Library, Chicago).<br>
<br>Above all Senex was esteemed for his globes. In 1706 Senex and Price announced a pair of 12 inch globes, the celestial one based on Halley's observations and showing nineteen new constellations &#145;never before printed on any globe&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 6&#150;9 May 1706). In 1708 the partners advertised similar 16 inch globes and by the time of his death Senex was providing a range, of international reputation, varying from 3 to 28 inches in diameter at prices from 10<i>s</i>. to 25 guineas. One of his largest examples is depicted in the portrait by Richard Wilson of George III as a boy with his brother and their tutor.<br>
<br>A man of broad and enquiring mind, whose name is found on the subscription lists of many of the principal technical works of the period, Senex numbered among his apprentices not only the map engravers Samuel Parker and Thomas Hutchinson, but also the encyclopaedist Ephraim Chambers. In 1728 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and read there on 4 May 1738 a paper concerning improvements to the utility of celestial globes. His wide circle of acquaintance and connection encompassed most of the leading men of science of the day, many of whom he published. His connection with Desaguliers extended not merely to publishing his works and translations but into the world of eighteenth-century freemasonry: when Desaguliers was deputy grand master of that organization Senex published (with John Hooke) James Anderson's <span class="italic">The Constitutions of the Free-Masons</span> (1723), the earliest such compilation, the text revealing Senex at that time to have been a warden of one of the London lodges.<br>
<br>In the same year Senex married Mary Wilcox at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 27 August. The only recorded child of the marriage, Elizabeth Maria (<i>b</i>. 1730), married in 1752 Fitz Foy of Duntish Court, and later Castle Hill, in Dorset. Senex died on 30 December 1740 and was buried in the new vault of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 4 January 1741, remembered in a contemporary obituary as &#145;a sincere, worthy, honest man, and greatly valued by men of learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hooker's Weekly Miscellany</span>, 3 Jan 1741). His will left his entire estate to his widow, who continued the business in Fleet Street until 1755.<br>
