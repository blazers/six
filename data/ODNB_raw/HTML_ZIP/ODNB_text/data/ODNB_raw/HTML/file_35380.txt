<span class="headword">Parish,  William Douglas</span>  (1833&#150;1904), <span class="occ">writer on dialect</span>, was born on 16 December 1833 at 5 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, St Marylebone, London, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21269/', "Sir Woodbine Parish (1796&#150;1882)")</script>, diplomatist, and his first wife, Amelia Jane (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of Leonard Becher Morse. Of his seven brothers and five sisters, the eldest, Major-General Henry Woodbine Parish CB (1821&#150;1890), served with distinction in South Africa under Sir Harry Smith, and later in Abyssinia; the second, John Edward (1822&#150;1894), became an admiral; and the third, Francis (1824&#150;1906), was sometime consul at Buenos Aires, and later consul-general and state commissioner at Havana. His half-sister, Blanche Marion Parish, married in 1871 Ughtred James Kay-Shuttleworth, first Baron Shuttleworth (the biography of Sir Woodbine is by their daughter).<br>
<br>William Douglas Parish was at Charterhouse School from 1848 to 1853. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in the latter year, and graduated BCL in 1858. In 1859 he was ordained to the curacy of Firle and Beddingham in Sussex, and in 1863 became vicar of the adjoining parishes of Selmeston and Alciston, a benefice he held until his death. He was for a time diocesan inspector of schools. He endeared himself not only to his parishioners but also to Gypsies and vagrants, and his sense of humour was proverbial. From 1877 to 1900 he was chancellor of Chichester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Parish's principal work, <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect and Collection of Provincialisms in use in the County of Sussex</span> (1875, 2 editions), is both a contribution to etymology and a classic example of what a country parson with antiquarian tastes, a sense of humour, and a sympathetic affection for his rural parishioners could do to record for posterity the dialect and the domestic habits of the people of his time and place. He also produced, with the Revd W. F. Shaw, <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect</span> (1887).<br>
<br>Parish's other publications included <span class="italic">The Telegraphist's Easy Guide</span> (1874), an explanation of the Morse system written primarily for the boys of his parish, to whom he taught signalling as a pastime. He also produced an educational work, <span class="italic">School Attendance Secured without Compulsion</span> (1875, 5 editions), a pamphlet describing his successful system of giving back to parents their children's school payments as a reward for good attendances. His <span class="italic">Domesday Book in Relation to the County of Sussex</span> (1886, fol.) was written for the Sussex Archaeological Society, on the council of which Parish served for many years, and he edited a useful alphabetical <span class="italic">List of Carthusians [Charterhouse schoolboys], 1800&#150;79</span> (1879).<br>
<br>Parish died unmarried in Selmeston vicarage on 23 September 1904, and was buried in Selmeston churchyard. A window and two brasses were erected to his memory in the church.<br>
