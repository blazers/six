<span class="headword">Szarvasy,  Frederick Alexander</span>  (1875&#150;1948), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was Hungarian by extraction, and was probably born in Hungary, the son of Alexander Szarvasy, a banker. Little is known of his early years. After spending some time in South America he went to London around 1901. There he joined a discount house, and later the stockbrokers Montagu Oppenheimer, where he became a close friend and colleague of Lord Charles Montagu (1860&#150;1931) and Baron Springer of Vienna. He then decided to move into the new issue and company promotion business, first buying the Cornhill Contract Corporation, and in 1913 joining Springer on the board of the British Foreign and Colonial Corporation (BFCC), whose chairman he became in 1923. The BFCC was recognized as a major issuing house during the 1920s. H. C. Clifford-Turner, a London solicitor active in many company flotations, considered Szarvasy to be one of the leading financiers in the City between the wars.<br>
<br>One flotation with which Szarvasy's name was particularly linked was that of Imperial Airways in 1924. In 1920, through BFCC, he proposed the establishment of a monopoly airline to bring together several small carriers. There was opposition, but in 1923 the Air Ministry reached agreement with BFCC for a public flotation, Szarvasy having settled terms with the various companies and persuaded Sir Eric Geddes to become chairman. BFCC handled the flotation for out-of-pocket expenses only, &#145;in view of the national importance of the business&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 June 1924).<br>
<br>Szarvasy knew Geddes well, as both had worked together at the Dunlop Rubber Company. In 1920 Dunlop had been brought to the brink of collapse by the speculative activities of the former chairman, Sir Arthur du Cros. Szarvasy was brought in as chairman in 1920 and cleared out many of the existing board members, introduced new capital to tide the company over its crisis, and put proper accounting procedures in place. By the time he handed over to Sir Eric Geddes in 1922 the immediate crisis was over; he remained on the Dunlop board until his death. Dunlop's accounts later became known as a model of information and clarity through the influence of Frederic de Paula, who joined the company in 1929.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Szarvasy was called in to several other companies where poor financial management threatened their survival. These included Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and William Beardmore &amp; Co., among others. He was involved with Alfred Mond, Lord Melchett, in the restructuring of the south Wales anthracite industry, and on Mond's death succeeded to the chairmanship of Amalgamated Anthracite Collieries, which controlled around 80 per cent of Welsh anthracite production; he retained this post until his own death. In addition he was on the boards of several other finance houses, including the Anglo-French Banking Corporation, Martins Bank, Guardian Assurance, and the Daily Mail Trust. He was keen to develop opportunities for investment in European companies, and in 1931 he spoke out against impediments placed by governments in the way of free movement of goods, labour, and capital. In his financial dealings he was very secretive; when he died his safe was found to be empty of records.<br>
<br>In December 1921 Szarvasy married Kate Muriel Rhona (<i>d</i>. 1924), the daughter of Augusto Saavedra, who was in the French consular service; they had one daughter. Szarvasy was deeply interested in music and art. He was chairman of the Covent Garden opera syndicate and was a generous patron of young musicians; he played the violin well himself. He died at his London home, 74 Portland Place, on 3 July 1948.<br>
