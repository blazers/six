<span class="headword">Stott,  George</span>  (1835&#150;1889), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 13 April 1835 at Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, the son of John Stott, crofter, and his wife, Jane Anderson. He worked on the land until at the age of nineteen he injured a knee; after two years, during which he experienced an evangelical conversion and improved his education, his leg had to be amputated. At twenty-two he became schoolmaster of Whitehouse, a village in the Grampians, probably a parish school of the Free Church of Scotland. He lodged with a farmer, James Lamont, and became engaged to his daughter Agnes.<br>
<br>Early in 1865 Stott heard that James Hudson Taylor, who like himself was nearly thirty, wanted pioneer missionaries for his new non-denominational China Inland Mission (CIM). Since few men with two legs were volunteering, Stott offered to go on his one leg and a crutch. Taylor invited him to London. Warned how badly it could go with a one-legged man in a Chinese riot, Stott retorted cheerfully with a text from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>: &#145;The lame shall take the prey.&#146; Taylor responded &#145;That's the man for China!&#146;  (Broomhall, 3.409), and bought him an artificial leg and a spare.<br>
<br>James Lamont withdrew his consent to his daughter's marriage, and Stott sailed single, with two other CIM recruits, a newly married couple, on 4 October 1865. They arrived in Shanghai on 6 February 1866. In accordance with the new mission's pioneering principle, they adopted Chinese dress. In November 1867 Taylor took Stott through an archipelago infested by pirates to the beautiful port of Wenchow (Wenzhou) in Chekiang (Zhejiang) province. As the only foreign resident for several years, Stott faced intense suspicion and considerable risk to his life. Nevertheless, he started a school which was soon the basis for a small but growing Christian congregation. In 1869 he proposed by post to <a href="#cosubject_49395">Grace Ciggie [<i>see below</i>]</a> in Glasgow, whom he had known briefly while preparing for China, and they married on 26 April 1870 at the treaty port of Ningpo (Ningbo), about 300 miles north of Wenchow. They arrived back in Wenchow during violent anti-foreign hostility provoked by the Tianjin massacres, but when calmer times returned the school prospered. Stott ruled it with the paternalism and strict discipline of a Scots dominie, aided by a little homoeopathy. He also rode around the countryside, evangelizing with humour and skill. He was not an easy colleague for younger missionaries, but he laid such strong foundations that even in the late twentieth century the Wenchow church was one of the most flourishing in China.<br>
<br>In 1884 all was temporarily destroyed during anti-foreign riots. Grace Stott was in Shanghai, but George had to flee Wenchow. The Chinese government offered compensation, but Stott disputed the terms and argued with the directors of the CIM. Although they reached a compromise he was now suffering from cancer, and the Stotts returned to Scotland; they moved on to the south of France as the guests of a supporter of the CIM. Stott died at Cannes, aged fifty-three, on Easter day, 21 April 1889, a one-legged pioneer who had become a legend in China.<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_49395"></a><span class="headword">Grace Stott</span>  (1845&#150;1922), <span class="occ">missionary and writer</span>, was born on 12 March 1845 and was brought up in Glasgow by her grandmother. At sixteen she became a deeply committed Christian. In March 1865 she heard Hudson Taylor speak in Glasgow and offered herself for service in China, but she was prevented from going by ill health. Instead she took as her mission field the prostitutes of the Salt Market area in Glasgow, where she worked until she received Stott's proposal of marriage. She landed in Shanghai on her twenty-fifth birthday. A formidable partner in the marriage, in 1875 she founded a girls' school in Wenchow, alongside George's school for boys, so that the baptized youths could marry Christian wives. After George's death she returned to a great welcome in Wenchow in February 1890. Having become, in the manner of the times, effectively the head of the schools and the leader of the church there, she impressed foreigners and Chinese alike by her character and talents. In 1895, after further riots, she was invalided home, escaping the cholera which killed her colleagues.<br>
<br>Grace Stott wrote <span class="italic">Twenty-Six Years of Missionary Work in China</span> (1897), which ran through three editions in the first two years. She then returned to Wenchow until she retired on medical grounds, in 1907, aged sixty-two. A good speaker and lively conversationalist, she helped to keep China in the public eye. She died in Toronto, Canada, on 24 January 1922.<br>
