<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pennyman,  John</span>  (1628&#150;1706), <span class="occ">Quaker schismatic</span>, was born on 14 August 1628, the fourth son of Sir James Pennyman (<i>d</i>. 1655), of Ormesby, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Joan Smith (<i>d</i>. 1657), of London. His half-brother, Sir James Pennyman (1609&#150;1679), was knighted by Charles I at Durham in 1642 and was later created a baronet by Charles II in February 1664. At fifteen John Pennyman went into the king's service and was made an ensign in the foot regiment of which Sir James was colonel. Following two years' service and the royalist defeat, he and two of his brothers took refuge abroad &#145;till his father and eldest brother had made their composition, and sent for them to come over&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 1).<h2>
<a name="Earlybeliefs"></a>Early beliefs</h2>On 8 February 1647, aged eighteen, Pennyman was apprenticed to a Mr Fabian, a woollen draper and fervent royalist based in St Paul's Churchyard in London. In 1650 he experienced a &#145;conversion&#146; while reading the epistles of St Paul and &#145;was fully convinced of the sad and woeful condition he was in by reason of his sins&#146; so that &#145;he began to walk, not after the flesh, but after the spirit&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 2&#150;3). His parents greeted his new religious experiences with difficulty for they were &#145;very zealous for the king, and Church of England&#146;  (ibid., 5). In 1651 he heard the Fifth Monarchist Christopher Feake speak at Christ Church, Newgate Street, and joined the sect; he remained with them until Feake's committal to Windsor Castle about 1658.<br>
<br>In 1654 Pennyman married Elizabeth Heron (<i>d</i>. 1668); in his <span class="italic">Life</span> he states that they had three children, and Quaker registers reveal that these included Anne (<i>b</i>. 1663), and Elizabeth who died in 1673 aged eight. At the time of his marriage Pennyman also notes that he had set up in business, and he evidently prospered as a woollen draper for he owned shops and houses at the west end of St Paul's.<br>
<br>Pennyman joined the Friends about 1658, &#145;finding the Quakers to preach up the power, and decry all forms&#146;, beliefs which &#145;seemed to come nearest to his sentiments&#146;. He was also attracted to &#145;the simplicity of their doctrine, and their patience and constancy in their sufferings&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 9). After some time, however, he came to believe that &#145;a great part of the Quakers&#146; had &#145;degenerated into mere form&#146;, having &#145;[set] up G.[eorge] Fox instead of the spirit of Christ, to be their Lord and law-giver&#146;  (ibid., 10). In 1660 Pennyman and others such as John Osgood and William Gosnell left the main body of the Friends, and held their own meetings in woods near Hanger's Green, but &#145;they still frequented their civil meetings &hellip; and stood by them in their sufferings&#146;  (ibid.). Pennyman's long-standing association with Thomas and <a href="#cosubject_69151">Ann Mudd [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and John Perrot, also Friends, may have stemmed from this time.<br>
<br>In 1663 Pennyman is recorded as a woollen draper living in Paul's Yard, London. In his autobiography he also mentions a country house in Kentish Town, where he went each Saturday. During the plague Pennyman rejoiced that his family were left untouched; at the time he and his wife were in Yorkshire, but the rest of the family was in London. They also survived the great fire of London, the family and servants being sent to Mile End Green for their protection. Pennyman married again following his first wife's death from a fever on 24 February 1668, but he suffered further bereavement with the death of his second wife, Dinah (<i>d</i>. 1669), at the home of her father, Nicholas Bond, in Pall Mall, St James's, on 23 August 1669; like his first wife she was buried at Chequer Alley.<h2>
<a name="SeparationfromtheFriends"></a>Separation from the Friends</h2>From about 1669 it appears that Pennyman began to have experiences more typical of the ecstatic behaviour found among some of the very early Quakers, and which consequently led eventually to his being disowned by the movement. In 1669 he recounted in his autobiography how he had gone to a meeting in White-Hart Court and, after standing up, had lost his breath and senses for a number of minutes, which seemed to provide him with spiritual refreshment. This same incident recurred at other meetings. In 1670 he related how he fasted for three days while confined to his bed and had a vision of the Lord. An incident with more serious repercussions occurred on 28 July 1670, when Pennyman began to find some Quaker books &#145;an oppression to him&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 26) and asked two porters to carry a bag of Quaker books and two other bags to a Mr Bates in Cornhill; he then &#145;stopped on an impulse&#146; at the exchange, where he asked for a candle and requested the porter to burn some of the books. This action caused a scandal in Quaker circles as rumour spread that he had burned the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but in his autobiography he stresses that the books burnt were &#145;not the two bags where the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Book of Martyrs, &amp;c. were&#146;  (ibid., 27). He was committed to Bishopsgate prison and later to Newgate. Pennyman defended himself in a letter to his brother which was printed and given away at the exchange. Nevertheless, on 10 August 1670, leading Friends disowned Pennyman for the public sacrificing of the scriptures and other books, declaring that they believed him to have been &#145;instigated by the Devil&#146; and &#145;in some measure broken and discomposed in his mind and understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Testimony</span>). Pennyman had this broadside reprinted in red with a black border and had it widely distributed. He was soon released from prison through the influence of his brother and nephew.<h2>
<a name="Athirdmarriage"></a>A third marriage</h2>Pennyman's third wife, <a name="cosubject_69152"></a><span class="headword">Mary Pennyman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Heron; <em>other married name </em>Boreman]</span></span>  (1630&#150;1701)<span class="occ"></span>, was the sister of his first wife. She was born on 1 May 1630, the daughter of Edmund Heron, &#145;a gentleman of a good estate&#146; and of &#145;great repute&#146; who had incurred considerable losses following the execution of Charles I, and his wife, the daughter of Justice Wood of Woodborough  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>). She first married the Quaker Henry Boreman (<i>d</i>. 1662), who had been imprisoned in London at Newgate &#145;for selling religious books&#146; and who died there on 17 October 1662  (Besse, 389) leaving her with three children and pregnant with a fourth. Mary had kept an oil shop in Leadenhall Street, but decided to give this up in 1670, after which she went to live with two other widows in Tottenham. It is possible that one of these was Jane Ward Lead or Leade (1623&#150;1704), the central figure of the Philadelphians, a mystical sect who followed Jakob Boehme's theosophy. It is thought that Mary dissociated herself from the Friends for some time after Boreman's death and may have held views similar to the Philadelphians.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1671 Mary went to live with Pennyman in Aldersgate Street. He recounted that he requested Alderman Ashurst for the use of Merchant Taylors' Hall because the Friends refused him the meeting hall at White-Hart Court, and there &#145;by special motion, with great solemnity&#146;, published his marriage  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 50). Great provision was made for the celebration with meat and drink &#145;to be all of one sort&#146;, twenty-seven venison pasties, a hogshead of claret, &#145;and sufficient for about 250 persons&#146;  (ibid.). The union provoked yet another furore in Quaker circles, with William Penn writing:<blockquote>We countenance no clandestine marriages, as we have reason to believe John Pennyman's was: for he came not &hellip; to be married, but to declare he had taken Mary Boreman to be his wife &hellip; but when, how, and before whom he did it, is known to few, if any. (Penn, <span class="italic">Judas</span>, 62)</blockquote>Clearly the union was not recognized by the Friends as a Quaker marriage as it had not followed &#145;those plain, public and orderly proceedings towards God, relatives and Friends, as which are owned and practised by us&#146;  (ibid.). In another tract Penn referred to Pennyman as &#145;that exalted J. Penniman&#146; and criticized the Pennymans' &#145;costly clothes&#146; and &#145;prodigal feast&#146;  (Penn, <span class="italic">Spirit</span>, 13). Mary in particular attracted Penn's opprobrium:<blockquote>[She] exchanged her cloth waist-coat for a silk farendine gown, her blue apron for one of fine holland, and her ordinary bodice for rich satin it self; to say little of her riding in fine coaches, and several other things (once accounted by her self righteous abominable things). (ibid., 13&#150;14)</blockquote>The marriage was also the subject of a scurrilous ballad by Matthew Stevenson, entitled <span class="italic">The Quakers Wedding</span> (1671). Perhaps as a result of the mainstream Quaker reaction to the wedding, the Pennymans, along with William Mucklow and Ann and Thomas Mudd, for the first time openly rejected the Quaker leadership of George Fox.<br>
<br>In winter 1672&#150;3 the Pennymans left London feeling called to visit Hertfordshire and Essex, which they did on foot. In a letter of 22 November 1673 William Penn wrote to Mary Pennyman, accusing her husband of being &#145;a reviler of our Friends behinde their back &amp; a Promoter of the Book Tyranny &amp; Hypocrisie detected &amp;c. by contributing to the Accusations therein mentioned&#146;  (Dunn and Dunn, 262). Penn also claimed that Mary had &#145;so puffd up the poor Man, that he is ever and anon ready to be cracked&#146; and of having &#145;entered &hellip; &amp; help'd to his being beguil'd, by swelling him beyond his place, as if he were some God on Earth&#146;  (ibid., 264). The book to which Penn referred, and which is thought to have been written by William Mucklow, was heavily critical of leading Friends and the central organization which was growing up in London. A number of Pennyman's letters to Mucklow, particularly in the early 1690s, were printed in his autobiography. In these Pennyman lamented the distance that had grown up between the two of them, which may have stemmed from a reluctance on Mucklow's part to continue his criticism of the Quaker leadership.<br>
<br>Pennyman appears to have lived at various places in the capital during the 1670s, including Hammersmith about 1672&#150;3 and Hackney from 1674. He records how he was labelled &#145;a disturber&#146; for interruptions to various Quaker meetings, apparently frequently  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1696, 148). In 1689, seven years since he had been to a meeting, he related how he felt moved to go to White-Hart Court; there, before anyone else spoke, he exhorted the meeting to cleanse their hearts&#151;for which he claimed he was violently pulled down by three or four Friends  (ibid., 160). In 1692 Pennyman and his family went to live with his son-in-law John Barkstead at St Helen, Bishopsgate. After publishing his autobiography in 1696 as <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Life of Mr. John Pennyman</span>, he went to the country, &#145;supposing the time of my departure was then near&#146;, and stayed there for three months, during which time he examined the writings of Matthew Hale, extracts of which he had printed  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1703, 188). It then appears that he lived in Hackney, about 1698, and in November and December 1700 visited all the Friends' public meetings, such as those at White-Hart Court, Devonshire House, the Bull, the Savoy, Westminster, Ratcliff, and others, where he was moved to warn Friends &#145;to hearken to truth and righteousness in your inward parts&#146; for all hearing and preaching was &#145;in vain&#146;  (ibid., 203).<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Pennyman produced about thirty works, the majority aimed against the Friends, such as <span class="italic">The Quakers Unmasked</span> (1682). One of the few works which was not, written with Humphrey Woolrich and Thomas Coveney and published as <span class="italic">Some Grounds and Reasons Drawn from the Law of God</span> (1660), criticized the law of imprisonment for the refusal of hat honour. Pennyman also co-authored some works with his wife: for example, <span class="italic">The Ark is Begun to be Opened</span> (1671) and <span class="italic">John Pennyman's Instructions to his Children</span> (1674) in which he writes, &#145;beware of taking up your rest in any outward form of worship &hellip; for our eyes have seen the sad fruits and effects&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Instructions</span>, 9&#150;10). Mary also wrote <span class="italic">Something Formerly Writ</span> (1676). In 1700&#150;01 John Pennyman published <span class="italic">Some of the Letters and Papers which were Written by Mrs. Mary Pennyman</span>, one of which included a letter to their friends Ann and Thomas Mudd in which she defended herself and her husband against their Quaker critics: &#145;they say we are turned into the world, but our desires truly are to get more and more out of the spirit of this world&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, 10). Appendices to Pennyman's own autobiography were also published such as <span class="italic">An additional appendix to the book of Mr. Pennyman's life being a collection of some more of his writings</span> (1706).<br>
<br>Mary Pennyman died on 14 January 1701 aged seventy, following several years of ill health. The following testimony by her husband reveals the closeness of their relationship: &#145;she was one of the best of wives, and certainly one of the suitablest, serviceablest, and comfortablest companions, for many years, especially in divine matters, to me&#146;  (Pennyman, <span class="italic">Letters and Papers</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). John Pennyman died on 2 July 1706 and was buried at Bunhill Fields seven days later. Like many of the Quaker separatists, his life serves to highlight the changes in Quakerism in its first decades and the tensions which arose between the spiritual freedom which the early Friends appeared to offer and the constraints imposed following the establishment of the local and central meeting structure.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69151"></a><span class="headword">Ann Mudd</span>  (<em>b. </em>1612/13, <em>d.</em> in or after 1693)<span class="occ"></span> was married to Thomas Mudd of Rickmansworth. Both became followers of John Pennyman and were either disowned by, or left, the Friends. Isaac Penington wrote to Ann and Thomas in 1672 with regard to forsaking meetings and criticism of ministers. In 1673 instances of Quaker violence in meetings were described in <span class="italic">Tyranny and Hypocrisy</span>, thought to be by William Mucklow, which also noted that the Friends &#145;would not spare that grave ancient gentlewoman Anne Mudd, who being moved to speak a few words among them, before their speakers began, Thomas Matthews, who guarded the stairs, pulled her away by violence&#146;  (Mucklow, 15). In 1678 Mudd wrote <span class="italic">A cry, a cry: a sensible cry for many months together hath been in my heart for the Quakers return out of that Egyptian darkness</span>, in which she accused the leading Friends in London of &#145;unworthy dealings&#146; with John Pennyman, and criticized Quaker central organization, urging them to &#145;ponder well what your meetings are for: are they not to exalt yourselves, and to make you seem more holy than you are?&#146;  (A. Mudd, <span class="italic">A Cry</span>, 1678, 4). The exact date of Ann's death is uncertain; however, she did write to the Pennymans on 10 April 1693 from Wilscomb, describing herself as eighty years of age and advising them that her health had dwindled, and that she believed she was close to death.<br>
