<span class="headword">Lowe,  James</span>  (1798&#150;1866), <span class="occ">inventor of a screw propeller</span>, was born on 13 May 1798 at Rotherhithe, London, where he was baptized, the son of James Lowe and his wife, Elizabeth. He was apprenticed on 2 November 1813 to Edward Shorter, a London master mechanic and a freeman of the City, who had in 1800 taken out a patent for propelling vessels, which he had named &#145;the perpetual sculling machine&#146;. In 1816 Lowe joined a whaling ship, but after three voyages returned to his employer. Later on he commenced business as a mechanic and a manufacturer of smoke jacks for roasting spits. On 30 May 1825 he married Mary (1804&#150;1871), the eldest daughter of George Barnes, builder, of Ewell, Surrey. They had at least two sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Lowe's spare time was subsequently taken up with experimenting on screw propellers for ships. On 24 March 1838 he took out a patent, no. 7599, for &#145;improvements in propelling vessels&#146; by means of a screw of one or more curved blades, set or fixed on a revolving shaft below the waterline of the vessel. His propeller was first practically used in the <i>Wizard</i> in 1838, and then in the navy's steamships the <i>Rattler</i> and the <i>Phoenix</i>. On 16 December 1844 he brought an action in the court of queen's bench against Penn &amp; Co., engineers at Greenwich, for infringement of the patent. The evidence was contradictory, but it was shown that Lowe, although not the original inventor of propellers, was the inventor of a combination of them never before applied to the propulsion of vessels. This combination consisted of three parts: a segment of a screw; a segment of a screw applied below the waterline, so as to be totally immersed; a segment of a screw applied on an axis below the water. The jury gave a verdict in his favour.<br>
<br>However, it was a popular field for inventors: at least forty other people proposed screw propellers before 1836. The main advantage of a submerged propeller was to reduce its risk of damage from naval bombardment; side and centre paddle wheel propulsion was developed earlier, but found to be too exposed. F. P. Smith (1808&#150;1874) and John Ericsson (1803&#150;1889) in the USA are generally accorded recognition for the innovation of practical marine screw propulsion (see <span class="italic">Introduction of the Ironclad Warship</span>, 1933, by J. P. Baxter).<br>
<br>On 19 August 1852 Lowe took out another patent, no. 14263, for his propeller. He apparently spent his wife's fortune of &pound;3000 in his experiments, reduced himself to poverty, and never succeeded in obtaining any compensation for the use of his invention. On 12 October 1866 Lowe was run over by a wagon in Blackfriars Road, London, and killed. He was buried at St Mary's, Ewell. His wife died in 1871. Their third daughter, Henrietta [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38088/', "Vansittart, Henrietta")</script>], who in July 1855 married Frederick Vansittart, continued her father's experiments, and on 18 September 1868 took out a patent, no. 2877, for a further improvement, which she called &#145;the Lowe&#150;Vansittart propeller&#146;. This useful device was subsequently fitted to many government ships.<br>
