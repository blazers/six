<span class="headword">Medwall,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>1462, <em>d.</em> after 1501), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was evidently born on 8 September 1462. His father, John Medwall (<i>d</i>. 1491), was a resident of St Margaret's parish, Southwark, by 1449, where he served as clerk, organist, churchwarden, and provider of banners and prick-song books. An Emma Medwall who died in 1498 may have been his mother. In 1475 Henry followed his elder brother John to Eton College, whence he entered King's College, Cambridge, in 1480. He left King's College precipitately in June 1483, at almost exactly the time his future patron John Morton, then bishop of Ely, was sent to the Tower. Following the accession of Henry VII, Medwall served as a notary (by 18 August 1489), and entered minor orders (1490). In 1491 he was granted a degree in civil law from Cambridge. In 1492 he was appointed to the living of Balinghem in the district of Calais, but was almost certainly non-resident, dwelling rather at Lambeth Palace, where he served Morton as chaplain and factotum. Following Morton's death on 12 October 1500 Medwall's name can be traced for one further year. He was separated from various benefices, and after 1501 disappears from the records.<br>
<br>Medwall is the first English vernacular playwright known by name. While a student at King's College, and during subsequent visits, he witnessed and perhaps participated in college disguisings. His service under Morton overlapped with that of young Thomas More (1491&#150;2), who, according to his biographer William Roper, would &#145;at Christmas tyde sodenly sometimes steppe in among the players, and neuer studyeng for the matter, make a parte of his owne there presently among them&#146;  (Roper, 5). The two interludes that survive under Henry Medwall's name were probably written for Morton's household at Lambeth in the 1490s (a proposed date of 1497 depends on the doubtful supposition that one or both interludes were written for the reception of ambassadors from Spain or the Low Countries). <span class="italic">Fulgens and Lucres</span>, the earliest full-length secular play in English, draws its plot from Buonaccorso da Montemagno's humanist Latin treatise <span class="italic">De vera nobilitate</span> (<i>c</i>.1428), translated into English <i>c</i>.1460 by John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester, and printed in 1481 by Caxton: in Medwall's play, Lucrece, daughter of the Roman senator Fulgens, chooses for a husband not the debauched noble Publius Cornelius, but the virtuous commoner Gaius Flaminius; meanwhile, in a sub-plot, her wily maid Joan outwits two servant&#150;wooers identified only as A and B. <span class="italic">Nature</span>, by contrast, conforms to the structure of a typical English morality play: Reason tries in vain to protect Man from Sensuality; Worlde introduces Man to Worldly Affeccyon, and thence to Pryde, Bodyly Lust, and other sins. Rescued by Reason, Man lapses into sin once more, but as Age renders him incapable, he finally faces death as a penitent, confident of salvation. Both interludes were published posthumously, <span class="italic">Fulgens and Lucres</span> <i>c</i>.1512&#150;16 by John Rastell  (<span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span>, 17778), <span class="italic">Nature</span> <i>c</i>.1530 by William Rastell  (ibid., 17779). A third play, <span class="italic">Of the Finding of Truth</span>, for which no text survives, is probably an invention of the nineteenth-century forger J. Payne Collier.<br>
