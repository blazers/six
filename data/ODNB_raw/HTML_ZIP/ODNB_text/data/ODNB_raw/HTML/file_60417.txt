<span class="headword">Wright,  Ronald William Vernon  Selby</span>  (1908&#150;1995), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 12 June 1908 in Glasgow, the eldest son in the family of four children of Vernon O. Wright (1879&#150;1942), organist, formerly an officer in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and later an insurance inspector, and his wife, Anna Gilberta Selby, daughter of Major R. E. Selby. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Melville College and at Edinburgh University, where he was deeply influenced by Alfred Edward Taylor, the professor of moral philosophy. He then studied theology at New College, Edinburgh, where he was taught by Hugh Ross Mackintosh, to whom he became deeply attached. During his student years in Edinburgh, 1929&#150;36, he was an officer cadet in the Royal Scots, student assistant at St Giles's Cathedral, and warden of St Giles's boys' club. He was a close friend of George MacLeod, who founded the Iona community, but he never became a member.<br>
<br>After being assistant minister of St Mungo's Cathedral in Glasgow for one year, Selby Wright was called back to Edinburgh in 1937 to become the minister of the Canongate Kirk, the church of the palace of Holyroodhouse and Edinburgh Castle, where he was to serve for the next forty years. There he continued his student work among the boys from the deprived back streets of the Royal Mile, and re-established the Canongate boys' club, which he was to run for fifty years. Although he was unusually tolerant with young people, his standards were unchangeably high. He was strict on discipline and expected the highest level of honesty and integrity from both old and young alike. The old Canongate Kirk, like much of the lower end of the Royal Mile, was in a very run-down condition, but through Selby Wright's untiring efforts, especially after the war, it was restored to something like its former glory. At the same time he set about recovering the historic worship of the church in line with John Knox's <span class="roman">Book of Common Order</span>, giving the sacraments a central place in the life of the parish, and provided the congregation with an enriched liturgy.<br>
<br>Commissioned as a Territorial Army chaplain in 1939, Selby Wright was called up with the outbreak of war and was sent on active service as the padre with the 9th (Highland) battalion, the Royal Scots, to France. There he experienced the disastrous plight of the British expeditionary force, and after some appalling experiences at St Val&eacute;ry managed to escape from the German army on one of the last little ships to leave the beaches of Dunkirk. In June 1941 he was persuaded by Melville Dinwiddie, the BBC Scottish controller, and James Welch, the director of religious broadcasting at the BBC, to become a regular broadcaster on the radio. At first Selby Wright was reluctant to leave his battalion but he was soon regularly broadcasting to the country and to the forces in particular, and he soon became widely known and loved as &#145;the radio padre&#146;. The whole venture was heralded as an astonishing success. Most notable was his ability to talk in a direct conversational style which gave inspiration, encouragement, and hope throughout the dark days of the war. In 1942 he became senior chaplain of the 52nd (Lowland) division and travelled to the Middle East and around the Mediterranean, continuing his radio ministry from transit camps in Italy. In 1943 he published <span class="italic">Let's ask the padre</span>, the fruit of what he taught and learned in his many hours leading &#145;padre's hours&#146;, and talking with young servicemen and -women. In November 1943, in his eagerness to be with fighting troops, he was posted to the 10th Indian division as senior chaplain. He saw service in Italy, Austria, and Germany. Throughout his life he maintained close contact with the military. From 1941 to 1976 he was editor of the quarterly <span class="italic">Scottish Forces Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>After the war the kirk and manse of the Canongate were the base from which Selby Wright called for creative reconstruction, not only in the parish and in the old town but through a fresh appreciation of the spiritual, ecclesiological, and literary heritage of Scotland, in which he was steeped. All his many publications, like his Canongate sermons and school addresses, were illuminated with brilliant allusions which reflected unusually wide reading and literary foraging in his extensive library. It was in line with his reverence for the tradition of the Church of Scotland that he devoted considerable attention to renewing the character and form of divine service in the Canongate Kirk. He drew upon the theological and liturgical insights of the universal kirk, but in such a way as to blend together historic reformed and classical liturgical traditions of worship. It was characteristic of him that his concern for the renewal of church worship was not divorced from the life and people in the parish and indeed in Edinburgh as a whole. His ceaseless pressure for reconstruction in Edinburgh brought him into wider civil activities. He served as a justice of the peace from 1963, as a member of the Edinburgh education committee from 1960 to 1970, and as chairman of Edinburgh and Leith Old People's Welfare Council from 1956 to 1969. He was always jealous of the kirk's connection with the state as the established church in Scotland, and accepted appointment by Edward Heath, the prime minister, to the Douglas-Home constitutional committee, which he felt he must serve as a parish minister. He successfully made friends and built bridges across the social divide, and looked upon all men as equal in the sight of God.<br>
<br>In 1961, in commemoration of his twenty-five years in the Canongate, Selby Wright was appointed by the queen as one of her extra chaplains in Scotland. Two years later he became her chaplain and served the royal family until 1978. It was said that &#145;he was one of Her Majesty's favourite preachers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). He was also chaplain to the queen's bodyguard for Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers (1973&#150;93), and he was appointed chaplain to the Merchant Company of Edinburgh in 1973. Just before his sixty-fifth birthday he was called to be moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, from 1972 to 1973. His moderatorial visits took him to India, where he encountered at first hand the horror of the slums of Calcutta and Old Delhi. He did much to strengthen and quicken the link between the overseas work of the Church of Scotland and the church in south India. At home he made a point of maintaining contact with the Roman Catholic church, not only through his friendship with Cardinal Gordon Joseph Gray, but also in his official visitation of various Roman institutions, such as St Augustine's secondary school in Edinburgh when he was moderator, and Sancta Maria Abbey at Nunraw.<br>
<br>Selby Wright loved the company of others yet he remained unmarried. Always interesting in conversation, he never missed an opportunity to drop names or give a commentary on the activity and movements of the great and the good. He was at all times generous in his judgements of others, with a discreet but sharp sense of humour. He was highly regarded by many, but never lost touch with the needs of the common man. He never tired of the company of young people. He made a point of understanding their needs, temptations, worries, and fears, and of finding simple direct answers to moral and spiritual problems. That was what gave rise to his successful series of little books entitled <span class="italic">Asking them Questions</span>. He was a frequent visitor and popular preacher at many public schools and held a number of honorary chaplaincies. Rarely has a minister of the kirk been so widely and happily acclaimed by church and state, crown and university. He was made an honorary doctor of divinity by Edinburgh University in 1956 and was appointed CVO in 1968. He had the cross of St Mark conferred on him by the patriarch of Alexandria when the latter visited the general assembly in 1970. He was remembered for his unfailing kindness to others, his unflagging concern for the needy, especially for the disadvantaged young of the Canongate, for his Christian ministry to poor and rich alike in times of peace and war, for his joyful godliness, for his selfless Christian ministry, and for his utterly impeccable moral character and purity of life. He was in every sense a man of the people but above all else he was a man of God. He died peacefully on 24 October 1995, seated in his armchair at his home, the Queen's House, 36 Moray Place, Edinburgh. His ashes were buried in the churchyard of the Canongate Kirk after cremation on 28 October; a memorial service was held on 6 December 1995.<br>
