<span class="headword">Grogan,  Ewart Scott</span>  (1874&#150;1967), <span class="occ">settler in Kenya</span>, was born on 12 December 1874 at 61 Eaton Square, Belgravia, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41308/', "William Grogan (1824&#150;1891)")</script>, a fashionable house and estate agent, and his second wife, Jane Sams, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scott (1846&#150;1895), a widow. He was the eldest of eight children of this marriage, but William Grogan's sixth son and fourteenth child. His father had professional dealings (1854&#150;90) with Gladstone, from whom the boy got his forename. After schooling at Boxgrove School, Guildford (1881&#150;7), and Winchester College (1888&#150;91) he read law at Jesus College, Cambridge (1893), but was sent down for rowdyism (1895). He studied briefly at the Slade School of Art before volunteering in the second Matabele (Ndebele) campaign (1896). In fulfilment of a boyhood dream he was the first white man to traverse Africa (1898&#150;1900). His journey on foot from the Cape to Cairo required valour and fortitude. He mapped districts, and earned the scorn of topographers by naming four peaks east of Kivu mounts Dorothy, Margaret, Hilda, and Sybil, after his sisters and his fianc&eacute;e's cousin (later Viscountess Monsell). His record of this adventure, <span class="italic">From Cape to Cairo</span> (1900), dedicated to Rhodes, is written with vivid power but often strident or vulgar: he used the term &#145;nigger&#146; to denote black Africans throughout.<br>
<br>After obtaining a forestry concession of 132,000 acres in British East Africa (1904) Grogan became with Hugh Cholmondeley, third Baron Delamere, the most successful leader of the East Africa Protectorate pioneers. Richard Meinertzhagen wrote on 23 May 1904, &#145;he has great charm, a brain as clear as crystal and a strong character. He not only means what he says but says what he thinks&#146;  (Meinertzhagen, 165). Lord Cranworth found him &#145;good-looking, with a fine physique and an impelling eye; he had a presence in full keeping with his reputation&#146;  (Cranworth, 25). Though Grogan appeared impulsive, his stunts were calculated. He proved an astute speculator, buying large land tracts in and around Nairobi. From 1905 until the 1930s he published many influential letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Elected first president of the Colonists' Association (1907), he repeatedly clashed with colonial officialdom. He talked fierily about settlers' rights, and among other provocations went out at midnight to peg a claim encircling Nairobi which was found to be legal. In the gravest incident he was convicted of flogging in front of Nairobi court house three Kikuyu servants who had jolted his sister and other white women in a rickshaw (1907). Grogan considered &#145;the nigger the most hideous of God's creations&#146; and despised &#145;any disciple of the poor-dear-black-man, down-with-the-Maxim, Africa-for-the-African Creed&#146;  (<span class="italic">From Cape to Cairo</span>, 78, 168&#150;9). The flogging was condemned by the colonial secretary Elgin and by Winston Churchill, who called Grogan a &#145;ruffian&#146;  (Hyam, 412). Sentenced to one month's imprisonment he became a bogeyman to officials and was not nominated to the legislative council until 1922. Instead he was elected first chairman of the Convention of Associations, known as the Settlers' Parliament (1911). In the legislative council he represented a succession of constituencies (with an interval in 1931&#150;6) until 1956. His firebrand speeches were sometimes insolent. His racial antagonism to Indian immigration was strenuously articulated in speeches and writings  (Grogan, &#145;Kenya: the logic of facts&#146;).<br>
<br>In the British general election of 1910 Grogan unsuccessfully contested Newcastle under Lyme as a Liberal Unionist. As a campaign preliminary he published his protectionist tract <span class="italic">The Economic Calculus</span> (1909). Grogan joined the protectorate's war council (1914) and his oratory was crucial to rousing settlers to war mobilization (1915). He undertook intelligence work with the east African force and was a liaison officer in the Belgian Congo. Blackwater fever contracted in wartime, financial worries, and domestic unhappiness changed him at this time; he became cruel and sarcastic at home, though to friends he remained charming. Having attended the Paris peace conference as adviser to Lord Milner on African frontiers, he took a lead in currency and economic issues affecting Kenya (as the colony was named) during the 1920s. In 1922 he opened Mombasa's first deep-water pier with railway wharves. He next bought 100,000 acres (1928&#150;30) for the cultivation of sisal and citrus fruits, and eventually amassed 500,000 acres. Torr's Hotel in Nairobi was built by him (1928). He was the first passenger to fly across Africa from Cairo to Cape (1932).<br>
<br>Grogan married on 11 October 1900 Gertrude Edith (1876&#150;1943), daughter of James Watt, New Zealand sheep rancher. To his enduring disappointment they had four daughters. After the First World War he conducted a succession of discreet affairs. In 1919 he fathered a daughter with Doris Tate-Smith (1890&#150;1993), a nurse who was an architect's widow. He fathered another daughter in 1929 with Doreen Wright (<i>b</i>. 1900), the wife of a political colleague. Latterly he was increasingly isolated by a possessive Irish consort&#150;housekeeper, Camilla Towers. After selling his business interests (1957&#150;62) he endured a miserable decline into deafness and blindness before dying on 16 August 1967 at Rondebosch, Cape Province, South Africa. He was buried the following day in Maitland cemetery there.<br>
