<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Edward</span>  (1568?&#150;1632<span class="mult">x</span>5?), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the third of the four sons of Sir Thomas Fairfax (1521&#150;1600), of Denton, Yorkshire. Edward's birth date of 1568 rests on nineteenth-century sources; he was probably born at Denton or Leeds. The records of his birth, baptism, marriages, and burial were presumably destroyed in the 1696 fire in Fewston church. Both he and his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9077/', "Charles Fairfax")</script>, are attested as illegitimate in Brian Fairfax's <span class="italic">Analecta Fairfaxiana</span> (<i>c</i>.1705) and Thoresby's <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span> (1715), but this was too much for some Victorian editors to swallow. We know nothing about his education, but he may be the Edward Fairfax who matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1581. From 1595 to 1600 he managed the Fairfax property. As his father's favourite son he was left the bulk of his father's estate and his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Thomas Fairfax (1560&#150;1640)")</script>, received &#145;divers legacies of good valew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godfrey of Bulloigne</span>, 5). Edward received a licence to marry Catherine Calverley, a widow from Otley in 1597, but there is no record of the marriage.<br>
<br>Early in January 1600 Thomas, whom his father had banished from the estate, led a gang of armed men into Denton Hall and forced his father to redraw his will. Edward was left only &pound;150 and Newhall at Fewston which the family had acquired in 1597. Edward's attempts to gain legal redress came to nothing. In 1600 came Fairfax's <span class="italic">Godfrey of Bulloigne, or, The Recoverie of Jerusalem</span>, a translation of Tasso's <span class="italic">Gerusalemme liberata</span>. Fairfax translated with an eye to Carew's version of the first five cantos (1594), Harington's version of <span class="roman">Ariosto</span>, and Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span>. <span class="italic">Godfrey</span> is shot through with echoes of Homer and Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, most of them developed from hints in Tasso. Fairfax's command of the telling phrase and wide-ranging and aptly used scholarship established his reputation. There were several seventeenth-century reprints, that of 1624 being at the order of James I. It is supposed to have been a solace to Charles I during his time in prison. Robert Alott included 50 passages from it in <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span> (1600). The poem strongly influenced the development of English poetry from Webster to Dryden. Waller, for instance, &#145;derived the harmony of his number from &#147;Godfrey of Bulloigne&#148;, which was turned into English by Mr Fairfax&#146;  (J. Dryden, <span class="italic">Fables Ancient and Modern</span>, 1700, preface). However Fairfax's Elizabethan verve fell foul of the eighteenth century, and of nineteenth-century critics who admired his style while doubting his fidelity. Also in 1600 he married Dorothy Laycock (<i>d</i>. 1648) of Copmanthorpe, the sister of Walter Laycock, the chief aulnager of the northern counties. Fairfax made peace with his elder brother, assisting him with the education of his children. Between 1600 and 1619 he moved backwards and forwards between Leeds and Newhall. He is recorded as resident in Kirkgate, near St Peter's, Leeds. He was interested in local antiquities and took a hand in parish affairs. In 1618 Fairfax was one of the signatories of a bill of complaint concerning the purchase of the advowson (the rights to assign the benefice) of Leeds parish church. He finally settled at Newhall the next year. There he lived the quiet life of a scholarly country gentleman, assisted his brother-in-law in checking the quality of locally made cloth, and owned the local flour mill. Fairfax also wrote twelve eclogues imitating Virgil and Theocritus. Only three of them have been published. He also wrote &#145;History of the Black Prince&#146; and an epitaph for James I.<br>
<br>After the death of Fairfax's youngest daughter, Anne, in October 1621, his eldest daughter, Ellen, reported seeing visions, and she, her sister Elizabeth, and a friend finally accused some local women of witchcraft. Edward took the matter to the assizes in August 1622. His case collapsed when the girls' friend confessed that the whole thing had been a hoax devised by her father and agreed to by the Fairfax girls who treated it as a bid for their father's attention. The friend's father was sent to prison, and the judges roundly criticized Fairfax's common sense. Fairfax recorded the whole affair in his <span class="italic">Daemonologia</span>, which never casts doubt on his daughters' story and ascribes Anne's death to witchcraft. In that account Fairfax describes himself as &#145;neither a fantastic Puritan nor superstitious Papist, but so settled in conscience that I have sure ground of God's word to warrant all I believe, and the commendable practices of our English Church to approve all I practise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Godfrey of Bulloigne</span>, 4). He corresponded on religious matters with John Dorrel (Darrel), a Roman Catholic priest imprisoned in York Castle. According to the <span class="italic">Analecta Fairfaxiana</span> Fairfax died &#145;about 1632&#146;. Morley claims he died in January 1635 and was buried at Fewston on 27 January. His widow was buried at Fewston on 21 January 1648. His eldest son, William, was grammatical tutor to Thomas Stanley, a noted editor of Aeschylus.<br>
