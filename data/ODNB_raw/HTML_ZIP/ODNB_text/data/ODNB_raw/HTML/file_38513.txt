<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barrow,  Florence Mary</span>  (1876&#150;1964), <span class="occ">relief worker and promoter of improved housing</span>, was born on 27 January 1876 in Birmingham, the only daughter of Richard Cadbury Barrow (1827&#150;1894), Quaker businessman and mayor of Birmingham (1888&#150;9), and his wife, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1831), daughter of the Quakers Hannah King and her husband, Benjamin Harrison. She was educated at Edgbaston high school and Mason College, Birmingham. At the age of eighteen, in 1894, she started a class in adult literacy for Birmingham women, thus pioneering the adult schools movement there. She went on in 1900 to train as a social worker at St Hilda's Settlement in Bethnal Green. August 1914 found her in Marseilles working in a quarantine department with Serbian refugees from the Balkan war of 1912.<br>
<br>In 1916 Florence Barrow was sent from Newcastle by sea to Murmansk in order to do Quaker relief work in Buzuluk, western Russia, helping what would later be termed &#145;displaced persons&#146;&#151;two and a half million Poles, Jews, and Belorussians who were in a desperate situation. She helped set up nurseries for abandoned children, feeding centres, co-operative craft workshops, pharmacies, even a circulating library. She witnessed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and noted: &#145;Men work for the common good but find it harder than they thought. Famine threatens; the rich are robbed of their spoils but selfishness appears under new forms. &hellip; New ideas and ideals seethe &hellip; who can prophesy what will emerge?&#146;  (Barrow, &#145;Stray memories&#146;, 4). She then crossed Russia by trans-Siberian railway, reached Japan, and then America, finally crossing the U-boat-infested Atlantic in a camouflaged vessel in order to report back to the Society of Friends in London.<br>
<br>In 1919 Florence Barrow was sent by the Friends' War Victims' Committee to distribute Quaker food relief in a starving Germany still punished by the allied blockade: &#145;[German] feeling very bitter in Breslau, &hellip; and as [the doctor] showed us one tiny distorted form after another it was almost more than one could bear&#146;  (letter, 28 Sept 1919, Temp. MS 590/3). From 1921 to 1924 she was head of Quaker relief operations among Poles in Brest Litovsk: &#145;I think that she must be an ideal head; she is evidently very capable &hellip; and seems only to be head by reason of her extra care for everyone&#146;  (J. Fry, letter to Friends' House, 23 Jan 1922, Temp. MS 590/3). Her monument there was the orphanage she left behind.<br>
<br>On her return to Britain in 1924 Florence Barrow co-founded the Birmingham Conference on Politics, Economics and Citizenship (COPEC) House Improvement Society that pioneered municipal slum clearance and the regeneration of inner-city housing there. She was the driving force for over thirty-seven years behind &#145;practical schemes of reconditioning, reconstruction, conversion and rebuilding&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Friend</span>). At the age of fifty-six, in 1932, she left Birmingham for Syria, Salonika, and Egypt to work once more with refugees. During the later 1930s the Quakers sent her as a secret agent to Nazi Germany and Austria, taking messages to and from endangered Jews. She later said she had found it &#145;very trying to know that every conversation might be overheard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Evening Mail</span>, 4 March 1964) and reported to the Gestapo.<br>
<br>Back in Birmingham at the start of the war, Florence Barrow continued to work on inner-city housing reform as honorary secretary of COPEC and to organize the reception of Jewish refugees into the city. In 1958 the city of Birmingham gave her its civic gold medal for services to its urban housing programme, including the provision of low-rented accommodation for single working women and &#145;sheltered housing&#146; for the elderly and for handicapped people. The city regretted to report that her active days as a social worker were almost finished. She was eighty-two.<br>
<br>Quiet, gentle, almost timid in manner, and only 4 feet 6 inches tall, Florence Barrow's &#145;outward appearance gave little indication of the power within&#146;  (&#145;Warwickshire Monthly Meeting&#146;, 14 Nov 1964, <span class="italic">London Yearly Meeting Proceedings</span>). She died at Bryony House, Selly Oak, Birmingham, on 3 March 1964.<br>
