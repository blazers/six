<span class="headword">Levy,  Allan Edward</span>  (1942&#150;2004), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born on 17 August 1942 at Bury Infirmary, Bury, Lancashire, the only child of Sidney Levy, a radio engineer, and his wife, Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis. The family lived at Prestwich and Levy attended Bury grammar school and Hull University, where he graduated LLB (honours) in law. After attending the Inns of Court School of Law he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1969.<br>
<br>Levy chose to practise in family law. His start at the bar was slow but he built up a heavy practice, mainly in public law cases and adoption, much of it at appellate level. In several important cases he lost before the trial judge and in the Court of Appeal only to succeed in the House of Lords or in the European Court of Human Rights. These included the case of Keith Barrett, who sought compensation from Enfield borough council for his treatment as a child in their care homes; dismissed by the Court of Appeal, Barrett's claim for negligence was upheld by the law lords in 1999. Levy was an early member of the Family Law Bar Association and sat on its committee between 1987 and 1997. He was for two years a committee member of the Bar Council and from 1988 he sat on the council of Justice. Appointed queen's counsel in 1989, he was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1993, and sat as a recorder from 1993 to 2001.<br>
<br>Levy first came to public notice in 1987 when he represented for the official solicitor the interests of a seventeen-year-old girl with Down's syndrome who faced a sterilization operation. In the same year he again represented the official solicitor in a case in which a university student attempted to prevent his former girlfriend from having an abortion. In 1990 he was asked by Staffordshire county council to co-chair an inquiry into abuses at a number of children's homes in the county where children had been subject to a &#145;pindown&#146; regime of isolation and other punishments. On his request he was joined by Barbara Kahan, chair of the National Children's Bureau. They took evidence from 153 witnesses over seventy-five days and in 1991 produced their finding as <span class="italic">The Pindown Experience and the Protection of Children: the Report of the Staffordshire Childcare Inquiry</span>. The report, which offered extensive and important recommendations, stated firmly that the punishments&#151;intended to &#145;pin down&#146; the problem of disruptive children&#151;were &#145;unethical, unprofessional and unacceptable&#146; and &#145;a fundamental abuse of human rights&#146;. The report made Levy a national figure and he became much in demand as a speaker at family law conferences within the United Kingdom and internationally. He managed to combine his commitments as a speaker with his two passions of travel and watching sport, his engagements occasionally coinciding with international cricket events in the West Indies and Australia.<br>
<br>Levy was a passionate advocate for the rights of children and strongly opposed all forms of corporal punishment. Notable cases included his representation in 1995 of five children who had been abused by their parents and who claimed compensation against the local authority that had done nothing to protect them. In 1998 he also took up the case of a boy whose stepfather, having severely beaten the child, had escaped prosecution for actual bodily harm on the grounds of necessary and reasonable chastisement. In both cases Levy was successful on appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. Levy's championing of children's rights led him to become a member of the Gulbenkian Foundation commission on children and violence (1994&#150;5) and the Howard League commission of inquiry into violence in penal institutions for young people (also 1994&#150;5). From 1990 until his death he was honorary legal adviser to the National Children's Bureau and a patron of the Children's Legal Centre from 1999. He was an obvious choice to chair the British Medical Council's steering group that in 2000 published its practical guidance, <span class="italic">Consent, Rights and Choices in Healthcare for Children and Young People</span>.<br>
<br>Allan Levy was an outstanding media communicator on legal issues. Despite his busy practice as a QC, he found time to give frequent radio and television interviews. He showed exceptional skill in explaining in clear and simple terms those cases, whether family or criminal, which attracted public attention. He made an enormous contribution to raising awareness of childcare issues and throughout his life fought children's battles through his cases, his writing, and his work as a broadcaster. In later years he became increasingly involved in cases that raised wider issues of medico-legal ethics, most notably an adult's right to refuse life-saving treatment, and from 1990 he sat on the council of the Medico-Legal Society. In addition to newspaper and journal articles, he was the author of studies including <span class="italic">Wardship Proceedings</span> (1982), <span class="italic">Adoption of Children</span> (10th edn, 1985), <span class="italic">Focus on Child Abuse</span> (1989, as editor and contributor), <span class="italic">One Scandal Too Many</span> (1993), and <span class="italic">Medico-Legal Essentials in Health Care</span> (1996). His work also brought him international commitments that included chairing the Inter-country Adoption Lawyers' Association (1991&#150;5) and the International Bar Association's meeting at the Hague Conference on Private International Law (1992), which focused on inter-country adoption. In the same year he became a fellow of the International Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. He was a visiting professor at Washburn Law School, Kansas, in 2001.<br>
<br>Levy was sociable, friendly, and generous, with a delightful sense of humour. From 1993 he was head of chambers at 17 Bedford Row, London, where he always found time to help younger members. He had a large circle of friends among bench and bar and, while he loved entertaining, he was also a very private man and seldom spoke of his upbringing or his life away from the law. He was essentially a city man and said that the only exercise he needed was from the kerb to a taxi. He was a member of the Reform Club and a devoted supporter of Manchester City Football and Lancashire County Cricket clubs. His main extravagance was collecting paintings by L. S. Lowry. He often said that he could never move from his flat in Belsize Grove, north London, because his collection of books was too large. He died from cancer of the oesophagus on 26 September 2004 at Edenhall nursing home, 11 Lyndhurst Gardens, Camden, London. He was unmarried and had no children.<br>
