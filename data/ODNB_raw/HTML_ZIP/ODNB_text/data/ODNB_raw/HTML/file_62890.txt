<span class="headword">Baird,  John</span>  (1798&#150;1859), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Dalmuir, Old Kilpatrick. He was apprenticed to an architect relative, John Shepherd, in Glasgow in 1813, during which time the firm was apparently responsible for completing the west terrace of Peter Nicholson's Carlton Place. (Baird's future chief assistant, Alexander &#145;Greek&#146; Thomson, was to marry Nicholson's granddaughter.) On his uncle's death in 1818, Baird took on the firm with his apprenticeship far from complete, and there are no identified projects for the next three years. Gildard implies that Baird may, simultaneously, have continued training in John Herbertson's office.<br>
<br>In 1821 Baird began the first of three Glasgow churches&#151;Greyfriars United Presbyterian (1821), Wellington church (1823), and St John's Chapel (1823)&#151;which were noted for their strong modelling and spare Grecian detail; Anderston parish church (1839) was perhaps the simplest example of this design approach, achieving grandeur with minimum effort. In all, he designed twelve churches, more than any other building type, which&#151;outside Glasgow&#151;were in fashionable but unconvincing Gothic; notable examples are the Congregational churches in Greenock and Dunfermline.<br>
<br>Baird is known to have worked on seven country houses or country house extensions&#151;including possibly Garscube, Dunbartonshire (1827), Clober, Dunbartonshire (1833), Stonebyres, Lanarkshire (1844), and Urie, Aberdeenshire (1855)&#151;mostly in the crisply decorative but architecturally unconvincing Jacobean of Cairnhill, Airdrie, Lanarkshire (1841). The office was much occupied at Woodlands Hill, Glasgow, preparing plans for the estate, for the simply classical Somerset Place (1840), for the grander, effulgently porticoed Claremont House, grandiose centrepiece of the later Claremont Terrace (1842&#150;7), and for Woodlands Terrace (1849). Baird was the natural choice of designer for the relocation of Glasgow University to Woodlands Hill, and prepared three abortive schemes in 1846&#150;9, in double-courtyard Jacobean style in homage to the original. In 1837 he had married Janet McKean from Bonhill. They had two daughters, Flora and Agnes.<br>
<br>Baird's principal buildings were commercial and innovative, helping to create the character of downtown Glasgow. They included the iron hammerbeam-roofed Argyle Arcade (1827), the austere Princes Square (1840), and vast warehouses or commercial buildings in West Nile Street (1851), in Buchanan Street and Ingram Street (both 1854), and in Argyle Street (1856). He was also responsible for the city block between South Hanover and Queen and Ingram streets (1854). Sir James Campbell's desire for an &#145;old Scottish&#146; fa&ccedil;ade for Campbell's Warehouse (1854) was met&#151;at Baird's suggestion&#151;by an idiosyncratic and highly unScottish fa&ccedil;ade by R. W. Billings. The fa&ccedil;ade of the pioneering Gardner's Warehouse in Jamaica Street (1855), thought to be attributable to James Thomson, with a structure using Robert McConnell's patent iron beams, comprises plain structural columns, beams, and mullions only.<br>
<br>Taking over an architectural practice before one is fully trained often results in business taking higher priority than design, which depends instead upon the skills of assistants. Baird's early assistants are not known. In 1836 he was joined by Alexander Thomson, who was first his apprentice and then his assistant until 1849. In 1859 James Thomson became a partner in the firm, now called Baird and Thomson. Baird apparently never took part in architectural competitions, regarding them as &#145;a species of professional speculation&#151;to use a mild epithet&#151;which he consistently protested against to the last&#146;, although he had been prepared to act as judge with David Hamilton on the necropolis competition  (<span class="italic">View of the Merchant's House of Glasgow</span>, 362, 382). Being &#145;a man not only of upright character and sound judgement but of also great experience in all that related to house property&#146;, he was extensively used as a building valuer and arbitrator, in recognition of which his business colleagues presented him with his portrait by Sir Daniel Macnee in 1857  (Honeyman, 1.23). Culturally, however, the office will be remembered for its contribution to early Victorian Glasgow. In John Honeyman's opinion, &#145;to the influence of such men we undoubtedly owe the excellence of our street architecture&#146;  (ibid., 1.24). One of the &#145;background&#146; architects of early to mid-nineteenth century Glasgow, Baird was responsible for at least forty projects of consistently high quality. Gildard, fifty years later, referred to his &#145;large practice&#146;, second only in importance and public esteem to David Hamilton's; which, together with his substantial wealth and extensive list of creditors at his death, implies the existence of other building projects as yet unidentified. Baird died at his home, Westfield, Partickhill, Glasgow, on 18 December 1859, after which date the practice continued as Baird and Thomson.<br>
