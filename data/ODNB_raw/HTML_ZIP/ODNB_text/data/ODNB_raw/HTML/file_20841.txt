<span class="headword">Ormond <span class="st"> [Butler]</span>, Sir  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1497), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4195/', "John Butler, sixth earl of Ormond (d. 1476/7)")</script>, and Raynalda O'Brien. Ambitious and quarrelsome, he was apparently raised at court by his uncle, Thomas, the seventh earl. He became expert in arms and entered Lincoln's Inn in June 1486. In 1487, Earl Thomas appointed Ormond as his deputy in Ireland in succession to Sir James Butler of Dunboyne. Yet this appointment was contested by the latter's son, Piers, son-in-law to Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare (<i>d</i>. 1513), and to whom Butler had bequeathed the office. Ormond did not return to Ireland until December 1491, when, as squire for the king's body, he was sent with Thomas Garth and 200 soldiers to defend the Ormond region against Perkin Warbeck, being appointed captain and governor of Kilkenny and Tipperary. In June 1492, now king's councillor, he was appointed joint governor of Ireland with Archbishop Walter Fitzsimons of Dublin, the deputy lieutenant, after the earl of Kildare's dismissal. Ormond also succeeded Lord Portlester as lord treasurer and apparently had primary responsibility for the rule of the southern shires. The new Butler-dominated administration gradually strengthened central government control over the outlying shires, as the proceedings of the 1493 parliament show; and supported by his mother's relatives, the Gaelic &Oacute; Briain family, Ormond also consolidated his authority over his uncle's estates. Yet Kildare's dismissal also stoked the old Butler&#150;Fitzgerald feud: clashes followed in Dublin between rival bands of retainers, Ship Street was burned, a former mayor was murdered, and in early summer 1493 there occurred Ormond's famous reconciliation with Kildare when Sir James, having taken refuge in St Patrick's Cathedral, shook hands with Kildare through a hole cut in the chapter house door.<br>
<br>Probably fearing that these disturbances would encourage another invasion by Warbeck, Henry VII dispatched reinforcements and in September 1493 replaced Ormond and Fitzsimons with Viscount Gormanston as caretaker governor. Ormond sailed for England soon after, to be joined shortly at court by other prominent magnates and officials. Over the winter, old quarrels were composed and a new initiative prepared to hold Ireland against Warbeck. This resulted in the appointment of an experienced captain, Sir Edward Poynings, as deputy lieutenant, with 653 soldiers and five or six experienced administrators and lawyers, one of whom, Sir Hugh Conway, replaced Ormond as treasurer. On his return to Ireland in June 1494, Ormond received a grant of manors in Meath, Kilkenny, and Tipperary in compensation, and was also appointed constable of Limerick Castle to keep an eye on Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1520), the unreliable ninth earl of Desmond. He remained closely associated with Poynings, accompanying the deputy and Kildare on an expedition into Ulster in November; and after Poynings's breach with Kildare, the deputy became even more reliant on Ormond's troops and local connections. Following Kildare's arrest for treason in February 1495, his brother seized Carlow Castle. Poynings and Ormond besieged it during the spring, retaking it in July; but by then Warbeck and Desmond were besieging Waterford. Ormond had to organize the defence of the Butler territories against Desmond's raiding parties and bring troops to raise the siege. After this, support for Warbeck collapsed and Poynings was recalled; and with the departure of many of Poynings's troops, Ormond's military role expanded still further.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1496, however, Ormond's leading position was jeopardized by the king's decision to rehabilitate and restore as governor the earl of Kildare. Sir James was summoned to court in July for a formal reconciliation between the earls of Ormond and Kildare and their supporters, but his role and prospects were now greatly reduced: the English troops he had commanded were withdrawn and Kildare favoured Ormond's rival, Sir Piers Butler. He became aloof and aggressive, mobilizing support in the Butler territories in alliance with the &Oacute; Briain chief and, according to Sir Piers, intriguing with Warbeck and claiming to be rightful earl of Ormond. Reports of his behaviour drew a royal summons early in 1497, and a second in May, both of which he ignored. Finally, he was attacked and killed by Sir Piers on 17 July 1497 in a kind of impromptu duel near Kilkenny, shortly before Warbeck's last visit to Ireland.<br>
