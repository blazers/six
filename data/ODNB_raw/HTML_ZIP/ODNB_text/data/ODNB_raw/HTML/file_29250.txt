<span class="headword">White,  John</span>  (1509/10&#150;1560), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born in Farnham, Surrey, the son of Robert White, a tenant of the see of Winchester. He was the brother of Dr Henry White and of Agnes, who married their cousin Sir Thomas White of South Warnborough. The latter had a sister, Sibill, who was married to a John White thought by some (including the diarist Henry Machyn) to have been another brother of the bishop. While this cannot be ruled out, it is made more unlikely by Bishop John's standing as godfather in 1559 to the son (yet another John White) of John and Sibill; if the two older Johns were brothers then it would have been thought inappropriate for godfather and godson to enter into the spiritual relationship which baptism created when they were already so closely related by blood.<br>
<br>In 1521, aged eleven, White was admitted to Winchester College as a scholar. He passed on to New College, Oxford, where he was admitted as a scholar on 3 December 1525, and became a fellow in 1527 (his fellowship was vacated in March 1535). During that time he took his BA (admitted 13 December 1529, determined 1531) and MA (23 March 1534). In 1537 he was appointed headmaster of his old school, Winchester College. At Winchester he was noted for his skill in poetry and oratory. He was ordained priest for the diocese of Winchester on 16 April 1541, a few days after his ordination as subdeacon and deacon, but in keeping with the times this had not prevented him already holding certain benefices; he was collated rector of Chilcombe, Dorset, on 14 November 1537, and was admitted canon and twelfth prebendary of Winchester on 28 March 1541, a few days before receiving major orders. He held the latter <i>in commendam</i> with several other benefices and canonries (rector of Cheriton, Hampshire, July 1543; canon of Chichester and prebendary of Ipthorne, 28 March 1550; canon of Lichfield and prebendary of Eccleshall, 4 May 1552), surrendering them only on appointment as bishop. He appears also to have been vicar of Keevil in Wiltshire, though this he had vacated by July 1550. In addition White vacated the headmastership of Winchester College when he was elected its warden in February 1542, a position he vacated about October 1554, several months after his episcopal consecration. At some time during this period he proceeded to the degree of BTh (later incorporated as DTh on 1 October 1555). It was also about 1542 that White became a chaplain to Stephen Gardiner, then bishop of Winchester.<br>
<br>Through the changes of religion wrought first by Henry VIII then by Edward VI, White seems to have been fairly content to comply quietly, at least up to a point. By his own admission, while headmaster of Winchester College he composed certain verses extolling the king's supremacy, and against the bishop of Rome (with the encouragement of Gardiner), which he taught to his scholars. It would appear that by 1551, about the time of Gardiner's trial, his conservative tendencies were becoming noticeable, to the extent that White was excommunicated by archdeacon John Philpot &#145;for preaching naughty doctrine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examinations and Writings of John Philpot</span>, 82). About this time also he entered into a controversy with Peter Martyr; White's contribution, a treatise (in verse) on the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the eucharist, was published as <span class="italic">Diacosiomartyrion. Id est ducentorum virorum testimonium, de veritate corporis, et sanguinis Christi, in eucharistia, adversus Petrum Martyrem</span> (1553; <span class="italic">STC</span> 25388).<br>
<br>White's relationship with Gardiner (he had clearly put himself on his bishop's side at the latter's trial) and his known conservatism made him a candidate for early preferment to the episcopal office after the accession of Queen Mary, and he was a member of several commissions for the deprivation and restoration of bishops. On 1 April 1554 White was consecrated bishop of Lincoln by Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, assisted by Cuthbert Tunstall and Stephen Gardiner at the church of the bishop of Winchester, St Saviour's, Southwark. Five other new bishops were consecrated at the same time. He was enthroned by proxy on 28 April, and again in person over 12&#150;13 October. In the following year, on 28 September, he was appointed a commissioner for the trial of Nicholas Ridley and Hugh Latimer. Foxe reports his courtesy and gentleness towards the two reformers, acknowledged in their words to the bishop in the course of their trial. His dealings with other heretics brought before him may not have been so gentle, judging from Foxe's report of the trial of Stephen Gratwick, where he acted more harshly, an approach which comes through in accounts of other later trials in which he had a part. On one occasion Foxe describes White as showing &#145;gross ignorance and barbarous cruelty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.374), while at the examination of Richard Gibson in 1557 he is recorded as saying that &#145;it was no pity to burn a heretic&#146;  (ibid., 440). This demonstrates, if nothing else, that White was one of the minority of Marian bishops who took an active and personal interest in heresy trials. It also suggests that he may have had more patience in his dealings with senior churchmen, whom he would have seen as his equals in learning and in ecclesiastical standing, than with the increasing number of lay protestants who were being brought for heresy trials in the reign of Mary.<br>
<br>It was as a preacher, rather than as a persecutor of heretics, however, that White came to greatest prominence in the Marian period. Soon after Mary's accession White was preaching in London in support of the restoration of processions. He contributed to a set of verses composed by scholars of Winchester College for the marriage of Philip and Mary at Winchester on 25 July 1554, and a number of important sermons followed. He was at Paul's Cross on 18 November, and preached at the opening of parliament on 21 October 1555. Within a month his former bishop and mentor, Stephen Gardiner, was dead, and White preached at the requiem mass sung for him by Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, on 15 November. When Gardiner's body was taken for burial from Southwark to Winchester on 24 February following, it was White who conducted the funeral rites. Along with other bishops he received Reginald Pole at the church of St Mary-le-Bow in London on 25 March 1556, where the cardinal was to be invested with the pallium after his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury. White's election to succeed his mentor Gardiner at Winchester on 15 April probably caused little surprise. Though he received custody of the temporalities of his see as bishop nominate on 16 May, it was a whole year before the appropriate bulls of papal provision were obtained from Rome, and he took full possession of his temporalities only on 19 May 1557. Although he appears to have spent little time active in his diocese, his persecution of heretics (conducted, as with his predecessor, largely from his base at Southwark) continued alongside his preaching career. On at least one occasion he combined the two, on 23 May 1557, according to the diarist Henry Machyn, directing a sermon in St Saviour's, Southwark, against an unnamed heretic who was present in the church. It was in that year that he carried out a visitation of his diocese, acting under a commission of Cardinal Pole. He was at Paul's Cross again on 30 January following.<br>
<br>The last months of 1558 saw a number of significant and important deaths; not only the queen and her archbishop of Canterbury (both on 17 November) but also several other bishops died around that time. Maurice Griffith, bishop of Rochester, died on 20 November and was buried on 30th; White preached the sermon at his funeral in the church of St Magnus the Martyr, just the other side of London Bridge from his own Southwark church of St Saviour. It was not for that funeral sermon, though, but for the one he gave at the queen's funeral on 14 December that he is best remembered. In the course of his sermon he made either the biggest <i>faux pas</i> of his career, or was subject to the most unfortunate misunderstanding. The main theme of his sermon was to warn against change, and in a passage which probably referred to the preachers of the day he quoted from <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span> 9: 4, &#145;better a live dog than a dead lion&#146;. This was taken, perhaps unjustly, as a comparison between the new queen Elizabeth and her recently departed half-sister, and as a result White was placed under house arrest. John Jewel, later bishop of Salisbury, described the sermon (preserved in BL, Sloane MS 1578) as mad and very seditious.<br>
<br>White was called before the council on 19 January 1559, admonished, and set free. On 31 March he took part in the abortive conference at Westminster Abbey between certain bishops and prelates and a number of protestant divines, and for his opposition to reform was committed to the Tower on 3 April. He is alleged in a number of sources to have threatened to excommunicate the queen, but J. H. Pollen argues that this is not found in any contemporary source but derives from a misunderstanding of the situation by William Allen. On 25 May he was allowed to stand as godfather to his namesake John White in the church of St Bartholomew by the Exchange beside St Anthony's. On 26 June he was deprived of his bishopric after refusing to take the oath of supremacy. On account of his ill health he was released from the Tower into the custody of the keeper of the broad seal on 6 July, and thence the next day to Sir Thomas White, the husband of his sister Agnes. He died of an ague at Sir Thomas's house at South Warnborough on 12 January 1560, and was buried three days later in Winchester Cathedral.<br>
