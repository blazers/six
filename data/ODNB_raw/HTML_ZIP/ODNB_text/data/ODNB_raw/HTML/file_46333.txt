<span class="headword">Roberts,  Evan John</span>  (1878&#150;1951), <span class="occ">preacher and miner</span>, was born on 8 June 1878 in Island House, Bwlchymynydd, near Loughor, Glamorgan, Wales, the ninth child of fourteen children born to Henry Roberts (<i>b</i>. 1844), a collier, and his wife, Hannah Edwards (<i>b</i>. 1849). His education was confined to the local primary school, and he left at the age of twelve to become a miner. From 1890 to 1902 he worked as a coalminer in Loughor and Mountain Ash, and in a smithy in Pontarddulais from September to December 1902.<br>
<br>Since his childhood Roberts had been a devout member of the local Calvinistic Methodist chapels at Loughor and Mountain Ash, and in December 1903 he began preaching. As he had no secondary educational background, he entered the Newcastle Emlyn Academy, which was kept by John Phillips, on 13 September 1904. The same month he attended a meeting at Blaenannerch, near Cardigan, where he received a charismatic experience. He called 29 September 1904 the &#145;most terrible&#146; but also the &#145;nicest day&#146; of his life.<br>
<br>Roberts decided to return to Loughor, between Llanelli and Swansea, where more revival meetings were held. In a short period of time, between November 1904 and January 1906, the religious revival spread throughout the mining valleys of south Wales, then to the towns and villages of north Wales as well as to the Liverpool and Birkenhead Welsh communities.<br>
<br>Roberts visited every county in Wales as well as addressing large meetings on Merseyside. Singing predominated: individuals would burst into song everywhere and the hymns of William Williams and Ann Griffiths were sung by his assistants, in particular Sam Jenkins, his brother Dan Roberts, and a number of female soloists who supported him. His future brother-in-law Sidney Evans, as well as R. B. Jones from Porth in the Rhondda valley and W. W. Lewis, were key figures. Roberts himself wrote hymns for the revival which were published in a volume in Aberd&acirc;r in 1905 under the title <span class="italic">Emynau wedi eu cyfansoddi gan Mr Evan Roberts (Y Diwygiwr)</span> (&#145;Hymns composed by Mr Evan Roberts (the revivalist)&#146;).<br>
<br>Chapels were filled daily, miners went straight from the collieries to services without so much as bathing, and would remain for hours singing, praying, and witnessing. Thousands were admitted into the churches; many thousands remained steadfast, while others lost their interest or joined the Independent Labour Party. To some young men, like James Griffiths, the religious revival and the Independent Labour Party were complementary movements. The revival, while stressing individual conversion, also awoke men and women to the realization that personal emancipation needed a social context. The revival created a situation which was ripe for a changing order of society, and ministers such as J. H. Howard (who had accompanied Roberts to scores of services) became Labour Party parliamentary candidates.<br>
<br>The daily press, in particular the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, did a great deal to spread the revival, and some journalists, like E. Morgan Humphreys of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span>, followed the revivalist to more than eighty meetings. He claimed that the homilies delivered by Roberts were not emotional, but an appeal to the conscience and the intellect. Roberts was supported by leading preachers of the day, though a few, such as the Congregationalist minister Peter Price of Dowlais, near Merthyr Tudful, were scathing in their criticism of the emotionalism involved in the services (which could last up to seven hours). A great deal of good work was done as far as crime statistics were concerned, with the revival spreading to the mission field of the Welsh Presbyterians in north-east India.<br>
<br>New denominations appeared, such as the Apostolic church, with its headquarters in Pen-y-groes, Carmarthenshire. By early 1906 Evan Roberts was completely exhausted and he was invited to stay at the home of Mrs Jessica Penn-Lewis at Great Glen, near Leicester, who enlisted him for her work in the Life of Faith crusade, and where he wrote a Welsh-language booklet, <span class="italic">Gwasanaeth a milwriaeth ysbrydol</span> (&#145;Service and spiritual militancy&#146;), published in 1912. For twenty years he was exiled in Great Glen, and London, and then took part in the occasional meeting in Wales between 1926 and 1931. But, as he admitted, no human being could stand the strain of another revival as an itinerant catalyst. He stayed with admirers in Porth-cawl and Rhiwbeina, a suburb of Cardiff, and he died, unmarried, on 29 January 1951 at Hillside, T&#375; Gwyn Road, Cardiff, being buried in the family grave at Moriah Chapel, Loughor, on 1 February. Later, in 1953, a statue to him was unveiled outside Moriah.<br>
