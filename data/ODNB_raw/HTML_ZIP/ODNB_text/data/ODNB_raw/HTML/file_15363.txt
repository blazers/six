<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Benjamin Hall</span>  (1804&#150;1889), <span class="occ">headmaster and classical scholar</span>, was born at Summer Hill, near Birmingham, on 6 November 1804, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15390/', "Rann Kennedy (1772&#150;1851)")</script> and his wife, Julia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15364/', "Charles Rann Kennedy")</script> was his brother. From 1814 to 1818 he was educated in his father's house and at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and throughout his youth owed much to the encouragement of his father's friends John Johnstone and Samuel Parr. The example of his father early imbued him with a love of learning and passionate admiration for poetry, and he read widely in his father's large library. When a child he thoroughly mastered an edition of <span class="italic">The British Theatre</span> in thirty volumes, and a love of dramatic literature never left him. In spite, however, of his discursive reading, he worked hard at classics, and when, in January 1819, he went to Shrewsbury School, the composition which he wrote, consisting, as the fashion then was, entirely of original Latin composition in verse and prose, exhibits astonishing command of Latin and power of invention.<br>
<br>Samuel Butler was the headmaster of Shrewsbury, and under him young Kennedy developed rapidly. In a year he became second boy, and in a year and a half, when he was not sixteen, head boy, a position which he held until he left in 1823. Among his schoolfellows were Charles and Erasmus Darwin. While still at school he sent in a copy of iambics for the Porson prize and a Latin ode for Sir W. Browne's medal at Cambridge; in both cases the examiners selected his composition for the prize, and, although he was not eligible for the Browne medal, he received the Porson, and the regulations were in consequence altered, so that he is the only schoolboy who ever won it.<br>
<br>In 1823 Kennedy went to St John's College, Cambridge. Professor J. E. B. Mayor says that the list of what he had then read &#145;sounds like the record of a Scaliger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, 227). In January 1824, when only in his second term, he won the Pitt university scholarship. During the examination Dean Law set <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 14: 6&#150;17 for Greek iambics, and Kennedy's translation was so good that the Greek professor, Dobree, had it printed and circulated. His other university distinctions were the Porson prize for the second time in 1824, and for the third in 1826; the prizes for the Greek ode in 1824, for the Latin ode in 1824, and for the epigrams in 1825, and the members' prize in 1828. He graduated BA in 1827, being a senior optime in the mathematical tripos, and senior classic and first chancellor's medallist. Throughout his undergraduate career he was as notable for his wit and his social qualities as for his scholarship. The first Lord Lytton, who for fifty years remained his close friend, recorded the impression produced by &#145;an ardent, enthusiastic youth from Shrewsbury, a young giant in learning, who carried away the prize from Praed&#146;  (Lytton, 1.232). He took frequent part in the union debates and became president in 1825. In 1824 he was also elected a member of the Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as the Apostles, where he formed a close friendship with F. D. Maurice and John Sterling, and in the same year became an original member of the Athenaeum, at the invitation of Richard Heber. Among his other undergraduate friends and acquaintances were W. M. Praed, Alexander Cockburn, Charles Wordsworth, Charles Buller, and William Selwyn.<br>
<br>In 1827 Kennedy went to Shrewsbury as an assistant master, but, on being elected fellow of St John's in 1828, returned to Cambridge to take pupils. Among them were Richard Shilleto, Charles Merivale (afterwards dean of Ely), Henry Philpott (afterwards bishop of Worcester), and William Cavendish (afterwards seventh duke of Devonshire). He was ordained deacon in 1829 and priest in 1830, and in the latter year accepted a mastership under C. T. Longley at Harrow, where he had the Grove House. In March 1831 he married Janet (<i>d</i>. 1874), daughter of Thomas Caird, of Paignton, Devon. They were the parents of a son and four daughters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56269/', "Charlotte Amy May Burbury")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48417/', "Kennedy, Marion Grace")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48417/', "Marion Grace Kennedy")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48418/', "Julia Elizabeth Kennedy")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48417/', "Kennedy, Marion Grace")</script>], and Edith Janet. At Harrow discipline was at the time extremely lax, and the general standard of teaching very low, and Kennedy's position as assistant master gave him no effective influence. But early in 1836 Samuel Butler was made bishop of Lichfield, and Kennedy, his former pupil, was nominated his successor in the headmastership of Shrewsbury, greatly to Butler's satisfaction. Although the headmastership of Harrow had fallen vacant at the same time, Kennedy made no concealment of his preference for Shrewsbury. He was also made DD by royal mandate at this time.<br>
<br>Kennedy remained at Shrewsbury until 1866, a period of thirty years, and throughout that time the school maintained an unparalleled reputation for classical training. It was poorly endowed, and could not secure brilliant boys by offers of rich scholarships. Although the headmaster was fairly well paid, there were no means of paying under-masters a good salary, and the whole burden of teaching the upper boys fell upon the headmaster. The buildings of the school, dating from the sixteenth century, were meagre and the accommodation for boarders very defective. Until Kennedy went there was no cricket ground, and the very scanty school grounds possessed a solitary fives court as the sole provision for healthy amusement. The numbers of the school were consequently never large; having inherited a pupil body of nearly 230, at one time Kennedy found their numbers down to about eighty. None the less he regularly sent up to the universities a succession of pupils, who carried all before them. A list of the very numerous distinctions obtained by Shrewsbury men at Oxford and Cambridge between 1840 and 1860 establishes Kennedy's claim to be the greatest classical teacher of the nineteenth century. His success was due to his energetic nature; his enthusiasm, like all genuine enthusiasm, was contagious, and his pupils left him possessed of the true key of knowledge&#151;a genuine and vigorous love of knowledge for its own sake. Yet there is abundant evidence that his teaching methods were erratic and idiosyncratic to a quite remarkable degree.<br>
<br>The veneration in which Kennedy was held by his pupils was shown by the large sum which was raised for a testimonial to him on his retirement in 1866. The money was devoted partly to the building of the chancel of the chapel at Shrewsbury School, and partly to the founding of a professorship of Latin in the University of Cambridge. Kennedy added &pound;500 to the fund, on the condition that the professorship should not be named after him (though since 1911 it has indeed been called the Kennedy professorship). The first occupant of the new chair was one of his former pupils, H. A. J. Munro, and the second was another, J. E. B. Mayor. It was to Kennedy that Munro dedicated his great edition of Lucretius and Mayor his famous edition of Juvenal.<br>
<br>While at Shrewsbury Kennedy was, in 1843, appointed prebendary of Lichfield, and in 1861 select preacher in the University of Cambridge. In 1862 a royal commission sat to inquire into the condition of the nine chief public schools, including Shrewsbury (which would have been inconceivable had it not been for the headmasterships of Samuel Butler and of Kennedy himself). Kennedy's published evidence clearly defined the value of classical study, though he had instituted a &#145;non-collegiate&#146; class at the school. Among the changes recommended was the use of the same Latin and Greek grammars in public schools, and the headmasters of the nine chief schools unanimously selected as the basis of the new Latin grammar Kennedy's <span class="italic">Elementary Latin Grammar</span>, originally published in 1847. Accordingly, a small subcommittee (which included Kennedy himself) constructed, on the basis of Kennedy's <span class="italic">Grammar</span>, <span class="italic">The Public School Latin Primer</span>, which was published in 1866, but was greeted with widespread hostile comment. Subsequently, however, Kennedy published <span class="italic">The Public School Latin Grammar</span> (1871), a more thorough and complete work than any which had preceded it in England, and not without value more than a century later. The Latin primer had met with much criticism, but it stood the test of time; however, the revision of 1888, and the <span class="italic">Shorter Latin Primer</span> of the same year, owed much not only to Kennedy's ex-pupils G. H. Hallam and T. E. Page, but also to his unmarried daughters Marion Grace and Julia, and it is unlikely that Kennedy had any hand in these works.<br>
<br>Before Kennedy left Shrewsbury in 1866 he had accepted the living of West Felton, near Oswestry, vacant by the death of his son-in-law, William Burbury, patron of the living. In 1867 he was appointed regius professor of Greek at Cambridge and canon of Ely, which offices he held until his death. He represented the Ely chapter as proctor in convocation for some years. At Ely he was held in great affection, and helped to break down the barriers which had long separated the cathedral body from the rest of the town. At Cambridge he took a vigorous part in the business of the university, and was elected a member of the council in 1870. With his daughters he took a keen interest in the movement for the education of women, and in an impressive speech in February 1881 he strongly supported the opening of the Cambridge University honour examinations to the women students of Girton and Newnham colleges. He was from 1870 to 1880 a member of the committee for the revision of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and took an active part in the work. In 1880 he was elected an honorary fellow of his old college, St John's, and in 1885 an ordinary fellow of it for the second time after an interval of fifty-eight years. In the same year he received from the University of Dublin the honorary degree of LLD. Kennedy died of bronchitis at Shipway House, Torquay, on 6 April 1889.<br>
<br>Kennedy's passionate love of poetry, and not merely their classical perfection, gives his compositions in Greek and Latin their singular charm, seen to best advantage in his <span class="italic">Between Whiles</span> (1877). In politics he was a Liberal, and in religious matters a staunch supporter of the established church, although intolerant of narrow sectarian prejudices. His general reading was exceptionally wide, and his memory unusually retentive. Of English history his knowledge was profound and minute; his familiarity with naval and military annals was remarkable. He was a brilliant speaker, with a voice and gesture capable of every modulation. His character was notably impulsive. In society he was an excellent conversationalist, overflowing in anecdote and genial humour. He is said to have been a knowledgeable connoisseur of wine.<br>
