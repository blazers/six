<span class="headword">Brookshaw,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1751, <em>d.</em> 1823), <span class="occ">cabinet-maker and decorative painter</span>, was baptized at St Philip's Church, Birmingham, on 10 July 1751, one of three children of George Brookshaw (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1722) and his wife, Mary Hawkes (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1723); his elder brother, the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3568/', "Richard Brookshaw")</script>, was baptized in the same church on 1 January 1749. Nothing is known of his father's occupation or of his own education or training. However, Brookshaw's Birmingham origins and his chosen career suggest a possible early association with the manufacturer Matthew Boulton (1728&#150;1809) and his &#145;mechanical painting&#146; venture.<br>
<br>By 1777 Brookshaw was living in London, where he set up business as a maker of (almost exclusively) painted furniture&#151;at first in Curzon Street, and from 1782 or 1783 to <i>c</i>.1794 at 48 Great Marlborough Street. He adopted a successful decorative formula of painted figurative medallions derived from engravings, largely after Angelica Kauffman, combined with panels of closely observed garden flowers and borders of delicate stylized ornament. This formula was applied not only to movable furniture but also to chimney-pieces in either wood or marble; sometimes the ornament was painted partly on copper panels, mounted on or within the wooden frame. Although lacking strong architectural qualities, Brookshaw's output accorded with a rather feminine expression of neo-classical taste. For a short period in the early 1780s his idiom was favoured by adherents of the refined Anglo-French style promoted by Henry Holland, including William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, and the prince of Wales&#151;earning him the appellation &#145;Peintre Ebeniste par Extraordinaire&#146; (inscribed on his bill for a commode supplied to the prince of Wales at Carlton House in 1783). Among his other patrons were Lord Delaval (1781&#150;3), Henry Somerset, fifth duke of Beaufort (1787), William Blathwayt of Dyrham (1791), and Sir Mark Wood of Piercefield Park, Monmouthshire (<i>c</i>.1794).<br>
<br>This highly specialized business may have been sustained by capital provided by Brookshaw's wife, Sobieski (<i>bap</i>. 1749, <i>d</i>. 1811), the daughter of a Birmingham gun maker, William Grice, whom he married on 20 January 1778. At some point they parted company, perhaps in the mid-1790s when he abruptly abandoned his cabinet-making practice, having probably been forced into bankruptcy; at his death in 1823 he lived with one Elizabeth Stanton, &#145;who has passed for my wife&#146;  (will). For up to a decade (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;1804) he lived under an assumed name, G. Brown, earning a living as a teacher of flower-painting and on the proceeds of his first painting manual, <span class="italic">A New Treatise of Flower Painting</span>, published anonymously in 1797. A &#145;third&#146; edition by &#145;G. Brown&#146; was issued in 1799, and the book was eventually reissued under his real name in 1816, followed by various supplementary volumes (on flowers, fruits, and birds) between 1817 and 1819. However, Brookshaw's most important published work, which indeed is of some botanical significance, was his finely illustrated treatise on fruit growing, the <span class="italic">Pomona Britannica</span>, issued in parts from 1804&#151;when he first resumed his own name&#151;and as a single folio volume in 1812. It was dedicated to his most illustrious former patron, the prince of Wales. But Brookshaw's renown in the botanical world never matched that of his cabinet-making career, and he failed to gain recognition by Sir Joseph Banks, Sir J. E. Smith, and other luminaries of the recently founded Horticultural Society&#151;perhaps in part because of the mystery surrounding his past, which he undoubtedly suppressed deliberately. His last years (1819&#150;23) were spent in obscurity in Twickenham and he died at Greenwich in January or February 1823. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Twickenham, on 6 February 1823 and left the bulk of his small estate (under &pound;450) to his only child, Caroline (by his wife, Sobieski), who died unmarried in 1864.<br>
