<span class="headword">Oatley, Sir  Charles William</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 14 February 1904 at 5 Badcox, Frome, Somerset, the only child of William Oatley (1860&#150;1944), baker, and his wife, Ada Mary Dorrington (<i>d</i>. 1911), schoolteacher. His father was intensely interested in scientific matters, and passed his enthusiasm on to his son. Coincidentally, 1904 was the year mains electrical power was brought to Frome, and William Oatley installed it in his bakery immediately it became available. Thus the young Oatley was surrounded by electrically powered machinery almost from birth, and his natural scientific bent was nurtured from the earliest years. After attending the local council school he went to Bedford Modern School, in 1916, as a boarder, becoming head boy and captain of the swimming and rugby fives teams. From Bedford Modern he won two exhibitions to St John's College, Cambridge, entering in 1922. There he read for the natural sciences tripos, taking a first in part one and a second in part two (physics). In his second year he obtained a half-blue for swimming, and in his final year he captained the university swimming team. His supervisor at St John's was Edward Appleton, who first aroused his interest in electronics. He also became acquainted with John Cockcroft, who was then at St John's reading mathematics. These two men were to have a profound influence on Oatley's life and career.<br>
<br>In 1925, on Appleton's advice, Oatley joined Radio Accessories, a small company in Willesden manufacturing radio valves. There he gained valuable experience of manufacturing techniques and, as the only graduate in the company, was called upon to tackle a wide variety of physical problems. After two years, however, he was invited to return to academic life by Appleton, who had moved to the physics department at King's College, London. The next twelve years at King's were spent largely teaching and examining, but he produced a number of papers on a variety of research topics, and, with the publication in 1932 of his Methuen monograph, <span class="italic">Wireless Receivers</span>, he became an acknowledged expert in the field. These years were, as he acknowledged in his writings, among the happiest of his life. He married Dorothy Enid West, the daughter of his science master at Bedford Modern, on 31 July 1930, and their sons John and Michael were born in 1932 and 1935 respectively.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1939 Oatley received a letter from Cockcroft, acting on behalf of the Air Ministry, inviting him to join a small party of university physicists to spend a few weeks learning about scientific developments which would be important in the event of war. Members of Cockcroft's party were assembled at Bawdsey Manor, where much of the initial work on radar (then known as radiolocation or radio direction finding: RDF) was carried out. Cockcroft later recalled the occasion:<blockquote>I arranged hurriedly with Watson-Watt to go to Rye instead, for Bawdsey was evacuated on 1st September. I had with me Oatley, Kempton, Shire, Latham, Ashmead and Dunworth; a very good party. We sat in the sun at Rye and taking the sacred handbook of Chain Home (CH) to pieces, learnt our RDF chapter by chapter from it. (Cockcroft, 3)</blockquote>Soon afterwards, Oatley joined the newly formed air defence experimental establishment at Christchurch, Hampshire, where in the early years of the war he built up a highly successful group to undertake precision measurements on valves and components supplied by industry and components designed in the establishment. In 1943 he became deputy to Cockcroft, who had earlier been appointed chief superintendent of the establishment. When Cockcroft moved to Canada in 1944 to undertake nuclear work, Oatley was appointed acting superintendent. He was appointed OBE in 1956 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the development of radar.<br>
<br>Immediately after the war Oatley was offered a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and a lectureship in the engineering department, which was then under the dynamic leadership of John Fleetwood Baker. With Baker's encouragement, Oatley revolutionized the teaching of electrical subjects in the department, particularly electronics, which culminated in his election to the chair of electrical engineering in 1960 (which he held until his retirement in 1971), and the introduction of the electrical sciences tripos in 1963.<br>
<br>Oatley's greatest achievement came with the development at Cambridge of the scanning electron microscope (SEM). His interest in the instrument was first aroused when he learned of pre-war work by Manfred von Ardenne in Germany. This had produced inconclusive results, but with his wartime experience Oatley perceived that new techniques and methods were available which could be applied to the scanning concept. His first research student commenced in 1948 and a working instrument was produced by 1951. This incorporated a novel configuration of the electron optical image-forming elements, producing startlingly realistic images of surfaces, capable of interpretation even by the uninitiated. These early results convinced Oatley that the SEM would become an important laboratory tool; however, this was far from being the consensus among microscopists. The new instrument was met with indifference and even, in some quarters, ridicule. Undeterred, Oatley took on more research students and ploughed more resources into the project. Over the following decade new instruments with improved performance were constructed, and new fields of application explored. After many setbacks and disappointments, his persistence was finally rewarded in 1965 with the launch of the world's first series production SEM: the Stereoscan, manufactured by the Cambridge Instrument Company. His book on the subject, <span class="italic">The Scanning Electron Microscope</span>, was published in 1972.<br>
<br>Many honours followed from this success, chief among which were Oatley's election to the Royal Society in 1969, and receipt of its royal medal (1969) and Mullard award (1973), and in 1970 the award of the Faraday medal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He was knighted in 1974. In 1976 he became a founder member of what was to become the Royal Academy of Engineering. His colleagues and research students held him in great esteem. Over 100 of them attended a one-day seminar held in his honour at Churchill College on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. He died at his home, 16 Porson Road, Cambridge, on 11 March 1996. He was survived by his wife and two sons.<br>
