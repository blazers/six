<span class="headword">Bell,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1760&#150;1816), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the eldest of the six children of the Revd William Bell (1704&#150;1779), Scottish Episcopal minister in Edinburgh, and Margaret Morrice, his second wife. Little is known of Bell's early life or schooling, though surviving correspondence of relatives indicates that the family lived in straitened circumstances, especially after the death of William Bell. In early manhood, Robert Bell was apprenticed to William Macdonald, writer to the signet, and was admitted a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet on 22 June 1784. In the course of his apprenticeship he would have attended classes in Scots and Roman law in the University of Edinburgh. He married, on 3 April 1790, Mary Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1838), the granddaughter of a country solicitor, and carried on the practice of a writer.<br>
<br>Bell became interested in the education and training of apprentices to the profession, which was almost exclusively based in Edinburgh. In May 1793 he put a paper before the general meeting of the writers to the signet proposing publication of a collection of decisions of the court of session and the institution of an annual series of lectures on the law and practice of conveyancing. Advising on and drafting property deeds was one of the main activities of writers to the signet at this time. This proposal, if not the salary, was enthusiastically approved later in that year, with Bell being appointed lecturer and collector of decisions. At that time, law reporting was disapproved of by the court, and Bell was warned in the strongest terms. The difficulty was smoothed over only when the course of lectures was finally begun in December 1794 and was well received. Although Bell only published two volumes of cases, he was no longer harried by the court and resigned as official collector of decisions to concentrate on his lectures, which he published in a revised form in 1815.<br>
<br>Perhaps disillusioned with continuing difficulties in obtaining the full salary for the post of lecturer and the absence of a permanent location from which to teach, Bell resigned from the Society of Writers to the Signet and took the step&#151;uncommon at the time&#151;of seeking admission to the Faculty of Advocates, the Scottish bar. He passed advocate on 4 July 1812 and practised at the bar until his death. Nothing is known of his practice, but during his time at the bar his lectures and several other works on conveyancing were published. His son William followed him into that branch of the profession on 14 December 1824, and edited and updated several of Bell's texts. Apart from his lectures, his <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Law of Scotland</span> is perhaps his most important work, which has been described as being &#145;full of still valuable information on nineteenth century law&#146;  (Walker, 385). Two of Bell's brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1999/', "Sir Charles Bell")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2013/', "John Bell")</script>, were distinguished surgeons, while a third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2002/', "George Joseph Bell")</script>, became professor of Scots law in the University of Edinburgh and a jurist of pre-eminent rank. Robert Bell died, probably in Edinburgh, on 1 November 1816 and was survived by his wife, who died on 4 January 1838.<br>
