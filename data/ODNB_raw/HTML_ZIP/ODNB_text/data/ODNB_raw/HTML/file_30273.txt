<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>  (1811&#150;1878), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and politician in Canada</span>, was born at Ayr, Scotland, on 11 March 1811, the son of William Young, a cooper, and Janet Gibson. He finished his education at Ayr Academy in 1824, then taught briefly in the parish school at Colyton, near Ayr, before emigrating to Canada. Having arrived in Upper Canada in 1826 he worked for a merchant in Kingston, and in the early 1830s moved to Montreal to work for a wholesale merchant on the St Lawrence. Initially a clerk, he rose to be partner of the business (1835&#150;40), after which he set up in partnership with Harrison Stephens as a merchant, trading especially with the mid-western United States. In 1846 the partnership broke up, and Young formed a new trading partnership with Benjamin Holmes. He was an enthusiastic advocate of waterways, particularly the construction of the Caughnawaga Canal to link the St Lawrence and Lake Champlain, which he championed ceaselessly but unsuccessfully for thirty years. He was also closely involved with projects to give ice-bound Montreal year-round rail access to the Atlantic via Portland, Maine, and to the Pacific via the American network. Young's economic interests expanded to include milling and telegraph companies.<br>
<br>Young's enthusiastic belief in free trade, expressed in numerous articles in the <span class="italic">Canadian Economist</span>, led to his involvement in politics as a Liberal. During the late 1840s he actively supported the Lower Canada Reformers led by Louis-Hyppolyte LaFontaine. Indeed Young was one of only a handful of leading Montreal merchants who did not sign the 1849 annexation manifesto. Rather reluctantly he joined the government as commissioner for public works on 28 October 1851. Because of his commercial experience and ability, his appointment was welcomed even by those who disagreed with his politics. He was elected to the assembly in December 1851 and kept his seat for two parliaments. In office he helped improve communications on the St Lawrence, but resigned from the executive council in 1852 when tariffs and tolls were used to penalize American goods after efforts to agree a reciprocity treaty had failed. In the election of 1854 he opposed his former colleagues and stood for the <i>rouge</i> party. He was elected to represent Montreal, but did not stand in 1857, for reasons which are unclear, and was defeated in 1863. After confederation in 1867 he became an outspoken advocate of a customs union with the United States, and he joined the <i>parti national</i>, which was associated with the Liberal Party in Quebec. In 1872 he was elected to represent Montreal, but the following year he chose not to stand.<br>
<br>Young was particularly influential on the Montreal harbour commission, of which he was a member from 1850 and chairman from 1853. Under him the commission expanded its scope and very substantially improved its facilities and its training of personnel. Young made personal financial gains as the harbour's fortune rose dramatically. His business interests centred chiefly on grain transport and milling, associated with which he owned substantial tracts of land, buildings, and transport facilities. He retired from active business in 1860 to devote more time to his family and to curling. In 1861 he, his wife, and their thirteen children moved to Scotland for two years to give the children a Scottish upbringing. They survived shipwreck on the return journey.<br>
<br>After his return Young continued active on the harbour commission and the Montreal and later the dominion board of trade: but as a result of debts incurred through speculations he lost his money and the family home was sold. His appeals for a government pension were refused, although he was given a number of patronage places. He died on 12 April 1878 of heart trouble exacerbated by sunstroke and was buried at the expense of the merchants of Montreal. He was one of the foremost Montreal businessmen of his day and left his mark in a number of lasting improvements to the city's transport links.<br>
