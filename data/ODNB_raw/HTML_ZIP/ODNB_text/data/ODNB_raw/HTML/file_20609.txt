<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogle,  George</span>  (1742&#150;1814), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 14 October 1742, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20608/', "George Ogle (bap. 1704, d. 1746)")</script>, litt&eacute;rateur and MP, and Frances Twysden (1711&#150;1750), coheir of Sir Thomas Twysden, fourth baronet, of Roydon Hall, Kent. His father died when he was four, and Ogle was entrusted to the care of a Church of Ireland vicar proximate to the family estate of Bellevue, Enniscorthy. Educated at Kilkenny School, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in December 1759 but did not graduate. Following in his father's footsteps, Ogle's initial enthusiasm was for literature, and he achieved a measure of fame as a poet and the author of a number of well-known songs, of which &#145;Banna's Banks&#146; and &#145;Molly Asthore&#146; are the best known. The latter was written in praise of Mary Moore of Tinrahan, co. Wexford, whose sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1798) became Ogle's wife. Ogle declined to publish his own creations, though he often visited Lady Miller's poetical assemblies at Bath and contributed to the volume <span class="italic">Poetical Amusements at a Villa near Bath</span> published by the lady's admirers in 1775.<br>
<br>Ogle's parliamentary career commenced with his election &#145;by his own interest&#146;  (Bodkin, 219) to the House of Commons to represent the county of Wexford in 1769. His &#145;great antipathy&#146;  (ibid.) to the then lord lieutenant, Lord Townshend, prompted him to vote with the opposition upon taking his seat. He continued to conduct himself thus during the lord lieutenancy of Earl Harcourt, leading Dublin Castle to conclude that he was a firm and committed member of the parliamentary opposition. Ogle denied this: &#145;The evil spirit of opposition never possessed me&#146;  (Black, 200), he informed the House of Commons in 1777. Rather, he was guided in his political actions by principle; his reputation as &#145;a respectable sensible man&#146;  (Bodkin, 219) and as &#145;one of the most popular characters of the kingdom&#146;  (Falkland, 24) derived first and foremost from the realization that he was &#145;a very independent man&#146;  (Johnston, <span class="italic">Great Britain and Ireland</span>, 350). Ogle defined his role as that of &#145;guardian &hellip; of &hellip; publick liberty&#146;, based upon his conclusion that &#145;the glorious principles of virtue and publick liberty&#146; that made the British constitution uniquely valuable had been &#145;restored&#146; in 1688 following &#145;the tyrant reigns of the Tudor and Stuart families&#146;  (Black, 385). This combined with his commitment to &#145;stand forth [as] the Champion of this country&#146;  (ibid., 200) to ensure he kept a wary eye on the Irish administration and, following the outbreak of war in the American colonies&#151;which he forecast &#145;would end in ruin&#146;  (ibid., 428)&#151;to single out the embargo imposed on Ireland's freedom to trade. He maintained that the embargo was not just contrary to Ireland's commercial interest, it harmed the empire because &#145;the constitution and the commerce are the two pillars of the empire&#146;  (ibid., 385). His determined opposition led him personally to spend &pound;440 on 200 barrels of beef and a further &pound;200 plus on fees and other expenses in testing the effectiveness of the embargo in 1777. This won him public applause that might not otherwise have been forthcoming since he was not in the first rank of House of Commons orators. The bulk of his many contributions during the late 1770s, when he was at his most active, were of the nature of short, pointed, and frequently unvarnished interjections that, given the esteem in which he was held by his fellow MPs, were &#145;always heard with attention and deference&#146;  (Falkland, 25&#150;6).<br>
<br>Ogle's dissatisfaction with the government of Britain and Ireland during the late 1770s and early 1780s, which stemmed from his reverence for the constitution, ensured that he was an active supporter of the patriots' efforts to win free trade and legislative independence. His willingness to support them in the division lobbies and his membership of the patriot club known as the Monks of St Patrick [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96301', "Monks of the Screw")</script>] caused many to conclude that he was a mainstream patriot, whereas he was an independent country gentleman of strong whig views first and foremost. This was manifest in 1778 when he spearheaded the opposition to the proposal to dilute the laws against Catholics. The security of &#145;the constitution &hellip; the Protestant interest &hellip; landed property &hellip; and the church and state in Ireland&#146;  (Cavendish diary, 10.2) was endangered, he insisted, by the proposal to allow Catholics to own property on the same terms as protestants. He could not prevent a generous measure of Catholic relief reaching the statute book, but his insistence that Catholics should not be allowed to acquire influence incompatible with the security of a protestant constitution ensured that they were not allowed to purchase land in fee simple. Ogle was not opposed, as he pointed out, to Catholic relief <i>per se</i>. He was prepared, he observed in 1782, when the matter at issue was the freedom to be allowed the Catholic church, &#145;to give the Papists every indulgence consistent with the safety of the established church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 1.200), but he drew a clear and immovable line at changing the constitution in church and state.<br>
<br>Ogle's determination to maintain the existing protestant constitution inviolate was consistent with his whig political principles. So too was his gravitation towards the Irish administration during the lord lieutenancy of the duke of Portland, a whig. Ogle was drawn to co-operate with the administration by his conclusion that &#145;simple repeal&#146; represented &#145;sufficient relinquishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 1.415) of Westminster's disputed claim to possess the authority to make law for Ireland, but he also had financial reasons for doing so. Having engaged in &#145;prodigal spending&#146;  (Bodkin, 219) over two decades as a result of which he &#145;consumed a very large estate&#146;, he was in &#145;extreme distress&#146;  (Johnston, 195) financially by the early 1780s. At the same time his role in discrediting the Reform Convention held in Dublin in 1783 vividly demonstrated his potential to the administration. This paved the way for his admission to the Irish privy council in 1783, and for his appointment in 1784 as registrar of deeds, which was worth &pound;1700 from the mid-1780s. As the register of deeds was a patent office, Ogle was not bound to vote with the Irish administration. None the less, his vote was forthcoming with sufficient regularity to ensure his inclusion on lists of Castle supporters from the mid-1780s. At the same time he demonstrated that he was not lobby fodder by taking an independent stand on parliamentary reform in 1784, the commercial propositions in 1785, and the regency in 1788&#150;9. The issue that most agitated him was the security of what, in 1786, he termed &#145;the Protestant ascendancy&#146;, and while he helped successfully to galvanize resistance to a suggestion to commute the tithes paid to the Church of Ireland at that moment, his die-hard resistance in 1792 and 1793 to Catholic enfranchisement on the grounds that it would &#145;overturn &hellip; the Protestant ascendancy in every town in the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 12.127) failed. As a result, he concluded that a legislative union was in the best interests of Irish protestants. He also promised &#145;never again [to] set my foot within&#146;  (ibid., 13.346) the Irish parliament, and while he returned to oppose Catholic emancipation in 1795 and to condemn parliamentary reform and emancipation respectively as the harbinger of &#145;a <i>republic</i> and a <i>separation</i> from Great Britain&#146; in 1797  (ibid., 17.334), his appointment as governor of co. Wexford in 1796 did cause him to concentrate his energies on combating insurrection. He did not stand for re-election in 1797, but his growing reputation as neo-conservative champion resulted in his successful nomination to represent Dublin city in a by-election in July 1798.<br>
<br>In his capacity as MP for Dublin city Ogle articulated the dissatisfaction of neo-conservatives everywhere with Lord Cornwallis's leniency towards the defeated rebels of 1798. He reflected their wishes by voting against the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, though he had previously indicated his support so long as it was &#145;proposed on Protestant principles&#146;  (PRONI, Stanhope (Pitt) papers, T 3401/4/2). Once the Union was enacted, he had little difficulty accepting it and he was re-elected on a strong protestant platform to represent Dublin city in the imperial parliament in 1801. He did not retain his seat in 1802, but his nomination to serve as grand master of the Orange order in 1801 gave him a focus in later life. He died at his family seat, Bellevue, on 10 August 1814, some sixteen years after his wife, and was buried in the churchyard at Ballycarney, co. Wexford. He had no children and his property passed to his nephew George Ogle Moore, MP for Dublin from 1826 to 1830.<br>
