<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander, of Invernahyle</span>  (1707/8&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was the eighth son of Duncan Stewart, laird of Invernahyle; his mother was a daughter of Campbell of Barcaldine. During the rising of 1745 Stewart was out with his clan, the Stewarts of Appin, having previously kissed hands with Charles Edward Stuart at Glenfinnan. He distinguished himself at the battle of Prestonpans and was wounded at the battle of Culloden, from which he succeeded in making his escape; he then skulked in his native Appin. At Prestonpans Stewart was in combat with Colonel Charles Whitefoord of Ballochmyle, whose life he saved when the colonel was in imminent danger of having his head cleft by an over-zealous clansman. Stewart then secured his prisoner's parole and visited him in Ayrshire while the rising was still at its height. After Culloden Whitefoord endeavoured to obtain for Stewart a pardon from the duke of Cumberland. When that was refused, Whitefoord asked that protection at least be granted for Stewart's house, wife, children, and property. This also was refused; but Whitefoord having thereupon requested to lay down his commission, it was finally conceded. Nevertheless the search for Stewart went ahead, but he could not be found, and he was afterwards pardoned under the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>.<br>
<br>Stewart, in later years, was a client of Sir Walter Scott's lawyer father and was his frequent guest at Edinburgh when Scott was a boy. Sir Walter later related that:<blockquote>His tales were the absolute delight of my childhood. I believe there never was a man who united the ardour of a soldier and tale-teller&#151;a man of &#145;talk&#146; as they call it in Gaelic&#151;in such an excellent degree, and he was as fond of telling as I was of learning; I became a valiant Jacobite at the age of ten years. (<span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 1.67)</blockquote>At Stewart's request Scott visited him in Appin in 1786 or 1787, when he made his first enthralled acquaintance with the highlands. It was Stewart's engaging story of his exploits during the 1745 rising on which Scott claimed to have drawn for <span class="italic">Waverley</span> (1823), wishing to make a reconciliation theme out of the Forty-Five and substituting the fictional Captain Edward Waverley and Colonel Talbot for the real-life protagonists. According to John Gibson Lockhart, Stewart also told the young Scott of his involvement in the rising of 1715. This, however, could not have been so, since Stewart was born in either 1707 or 1708, giving his age as forty-four at the trial of James Stewart of the Glen in 1752. Stewart was married to Katherine, daughter of Robert Stewart, laird of Appin; the couple had fifteen children, of whom Dugald succeeded Stewart on his death in 1795. Before his death he had sold the estate of Invernahyle.<br>
