<span class="headword">Masquerier,  John James</span>  (1778&#150;1855), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Chelsea, London, on 5 October 1778, of French Huguenot parents. He had two elder brothers, both of whom emigrated to America; Louis (or Lewis) married in Bourbon, Kentucky, in 1798 and named his first daughter Mary Barbot (later Barbett), preserving the maiden name of his mother, who was born in 1742 or 1743. His father, Lewis Masquerier (1735/6&#150;1803), returned with his family in 1789 to Paris, where his wife and daughter opened a school. Masquerier entered the Acad&eacute;mie Royale as a painting student in the studio of Fran&ccedil;ois Vincent. In 1792 he made a drawing of his father (BM), who remained in Paris until his death in 1803. From the vantage point of Vincent's second-floor studio in the Palais du Louvre, Masquerier witnessed many of the unfolding events of the French Revolution. He knew Danton especially well, as he used to come and practise speaking English to the boy. After the massacres of the first reign of terror in September 1792, rumours circulated that all foreigners would be arrested. Masquerier fled to England, while his mother and sister remained in Paris. Though imprisoned, they were eventually released and continued to run the school in Paris until 1814. Masquerier enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools on 31 December 1792. He received the silver medal in 1794 and in the following year exhibited his first work in the annual exhibition, a self-portrait. In 1796 he exhibited <span class="italic">The Incredulity of St Thomas</span>, his only attempt at grand-manner history painting; thereafter he concentrated primarily on portraiture. He is said to have worked as an assistant to John Hoppner, but soon gained a clientele of his own, thanks to support from one Alexander (an MP whose portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1803) and Major John Scott Waring (whose portrait he painted in 1801).<br>
<br>In 1800 Masquerier returned to Paris, and was granted access through Mme Tallien to Napoleon to make drawings of him from life. On his return to London he created a composition, <span class="italic">Napoleon Reviewing the Consular Guard in the Court of the Tuileries</span>. The work was exhibited in a house in Piccadilly in 1801 and excited intense interest as the first true likeness of the first consul seen in England. The sale of tickets reputedly brought the artist &pound;1000, along with an accusation from &#145;Peter Porcupine&#146; (William Cobbett) of acting as an enemy agent, which he refuted by the production of the register of his birth in England.<br>
<br>Masquerier was again in Paris in 1802, assisting Joseph Farington and others among the many English artists who flocked to the city during the peace of Amiens. On this occasion he probably painted the portrait of Mme Tallien which he showed at the Royal Academy in 1803. The mezzotint after this portrait by William Bond published the same year reveals, aptly, a debt to David. Masquerier continued to maintain contacts with some of the leading French artists: his surviving papers include an undated invitation to visit the studio of G&eacute;rard and a letter from Girodet in 1823 expressing gratitude for numerous visits from Masquerier over the years.<br>
<br>Masquerier had by now gained a particular reputation among patrons from Ireland and Scotland, but failed to establish any individual style. He fluctuated between the manner of Romney, of Hoppner, and of Lawrence; his Scottish sitters are often painted in conscious emulation of Raeburn. In 1810 he spent five months as guest of George Augustus, second marquess of Donegal, completing eleven canvases. It was, however, through his Scottish connections that he met his future wife, Rachel Scott (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Forbes-Mitchell), whom he married in 1812. She was the widow of Robert Eden Scott (1770&#150;1811), professor of moral philosophy at Aberdeen University, and descended on both her father's and her mother's side from aristocratic Scottish families. She died in 1850. Thus he came to paint the portrait of the poet James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, and John McDairmid, through whom he became acquainted with many of the circle of Sir Walter Scott. His small-scale portrait of the playwright and poet Joanna Baillie seated in an interior (1831; University of Glasgow), reminiscent of the style of Francis Wheatley or perhaps of Louis Boilly, is one of his more unusual and original works.<br>
<br>While his annual submissions to the Royal Academy were almost exclusively portraits, Masquerier produced occasional fancy and historical pictures for the British Institution. It was there that he showed in 1816 <span class="italic">Sketch of a Meeting between the Duke of Wellington and Marshal Blucher at the Belle Alliance after the Victory of Waterloo</span>, based on a visit to the battlefield. The appearance of paintings of Italian monuments in 1819 presumably derives from a further continental visit in 1818. Masquerier painted a royal sitter only once. This was the duke of Sussex; the portrait was exhibited in 1812 and engraved by Hodgetts in 1813. Other notable sitters included Lady Hamilton in 1804 and Michael Faraday, who retained a lifelong affection for the painter.<br>
<br>In 1823 Masquerier effectively retired from his practice as portrait painter, accepting commissions only from family and close friends. He moved to Brighton in 1824, but made frequent trips abroad over the next twenty-five years, often in the company of Henry Crabb Robinson. During these final years he formed a special relationship with Baroness Burdett-Coutts; it seems to have dated from 1828, when she sat for him as the duchess in <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel to the Duchess of Buccleugh</span> (exh. British Institution, 1828). Baroness Burdett-Coutts subsequently owned many paintings from all periods of Masquerier's career (most were sold at Christies on 4 May 1922). Masquerier died at his home, 10 Western Cottages, Brighton, on 13 March 1855, and was buried on 20 March in St Andrew's Church, Hove.<br>
