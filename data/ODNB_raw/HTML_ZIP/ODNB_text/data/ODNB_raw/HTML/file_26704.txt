<span class="headword">Stuart,  Gilbert</span>  (1743&#150;1786), <span class="occ">historian and political writer</span>, was born in the Old College Buildings, Edinburgh, on 9 November 1743, the eldest of six children of George Stuart (<i>bap</i>. 1711, <i>d</i>. 1793), professor of humanity, and Jean Duncanson (<i>b</i>. 1712, <i>d</i>. in or before 1793) of Gearsheath in Dunbartonshire. Distinct from much writing of his day, Stuart's works are characterized by their intensity of personal feeling and their oppositional rhetoric. Journalism was his main source of income, but historical writing was his true calling. Excessive drinking shortened his life and brought upon him the opprobrium of critics in his own lifetime and ever since, but alcohol made him a &#145;boon companion&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1786, 716) and warmed a pen that naturally tended towards extremes.<br>
<br>Stuart grew up among the professors and students at Edinburgh University, where he attended lectures, but did not take a degree. As a young man, he worked in the university library, which his father had been cataloguing since 1747, and about 1766 began a legal apprenticeship. The novelist Henry Mackenzie, a fellow apprentice, recalled that &#145;Gilbert sat up too late, and drank too much to be often there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes and Egotisms</span>, 174). Stuart was not inclined towards the law as a profession, seeing in it only the &#145;sordid prospect of future gain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 47.362). During this time he wrote <span class="italic">An Historical Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the English Constitution</span>. Published in 1768, the work summarizes the history of English liberty from the time of the first Britons to the Norman invasion. Implicit in this whiggish perspective was a challenge to David Hume, whose <span class="italic">History of England</span> had put a relativist historiographical agenda at the forefront of the debate on the nature of British liberty. In this ambitious attempt to synthesize the conjectural method of such writers as Kames and Adam Ferguson with the controversial approach of his relative Thomas Ruddiman, Stuart applied the legal scholarship of Montesquieu and John Dalrymple.<br>
<br>Stuart's attempt to purchase the chair of public law at Edinburgh University on the strength of his first book and his father's influence proved unsuccessful. All he could obtain was an honorary LLD in November 1768, from which time he was known as &#145;Dr Stuart&#146;  (Edinburgh University, senate minutes). As other employment opportunities in Scotland did not materialize, he set off for London's Grub Street. Thomas Somerville referred to frequent drunken gatherings in London over which Stuart was &#145;assigned oracular authority&#146; and at which &#145;contempt was expressed for the most esteemed authors living&#146;. While Somerville condemned Stuart's profligate habits, he also acknowledged his &#145;transcendent intellectual talents&#146; and his &#145;facility and quickness in composing&#151;the more extraordinary because his style has so much the appearance of art and elaboration&#146;  (Somerville, 149).<br>
<br>As a periodical writer Stuart contributed mainly to the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. For Ralph Griffiths's <span class="italic">Monthly</span> he wrote reviews and notices for nearly 250 books during his career. In Stuart's best reviews the polite surface of eighteenth-century criticism gives way to a dynamic, sometimes personal, commentary. By employing the vocabulary of controversy as a rhetorical tool, he engaged his reader and charged his text with emotion, making his reviews writing to be read for entertainment as well as a vehicle for judging literature.<br>
<br>The most important association Stuart formed in London was with the bookseller&#150;publisher John Murray. Stuart read prospective publications and for a six-month period in 1770 edited Murray's <span class="italic">Repository</span>, a short-lived monthly composed mainly of articles on Junius and John Wilkes. Stuart's talent for translation was also promoted by the publisher. He received nearly &pound;30 for translating a quarter of Millot's <span class="italic">&Eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'histoire d'Angleterre</span>, and completed the whole of Delolme's <span class="italic">Constitution de l'Angleterre</span>.<br>
<br>Several other projects engaged Stuart during his first stay in London. After preparing for the press Rolt's short <span class="italic">History of the Isle of Man</span> (1772), he began his own comprehensive Manx history and obtained the patronage of the third duke of Atholl, whose family had lost their sovereignty over the island in 1765. When the duke decided against publication in March 1773, Stuart was compensated with just 50 guineas, an event which sorely disappointed him. (The manuscript is preserved in the Manx Museum Library at Douglas.) Another unrealized project was a biography of Tobias Smollett. A cousin of the novelist, James Smollett of Bonhill, had agreed to supply Stuart with original material and to introduce him to the widow and sister, but these relatives proved to be unco-operative and the biography never materialized. Yet another work was a history of Edinburgh which was advertised in the press but never appeared  (<span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, 27 Nov 1773). A final publication initiated by Stuart before returning to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1773 was his introduction and notes to the second edition of Francis Sullivan's <span class="italic">Lectures on the Constitution and Laws of England</span> (1776), largely a reworking of the themes in the earlier <span class="italic">English Constitution</span>.<br>
<br>With the printer William Smellie, Stuart established the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine and Review</span>. This monthly work&#151;published from November 1773 to August 1776&#151;became a lively forum for the expression of religious, political, and literary opinion. In the history of Scottish literary criticism it stands between the short-lived <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of 1755&#150;6 and the successful journal of the same name founded by Francis Jeffrey and others in 1802. It suffered from the provincialism of the former and anticipated the audacious style of the latter. Pride in Scottish achievement and the boldness to criticize whatever or whomever he found objectionable formed the central elements of Stuart's journalistic method. Among those attacked were the Revd Robert Henry and Lord Monboddo, whose <span class="italic">Origin and Progress of Language</span> was so maligned that many readers cancelled their magazine subscriptions. While generally aligned with the moderate party of the Scottish church, the periodical was too often guided by Stuart's personal animosities and provincial concerns to retain either patronage or, ultimately, a wide audience.<br>
<br>When the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine and Review</span> folded, Stuart returned to historical writing. The <span class="italic">View of Society in Europe</span> (1778), regarded as his most important historical work, went into several editions and was translated into German in 1779 and French in 1789. The concept of property, as it developed from an object of communal to private interest, formed the framework from which Stuart considered such topics as the roles of the sexes, the place of religion, and the state of manners in medieval European society. In part Stuart wrote the <span class="italic">View of Society</span> in opposition to the introductory volume of William Robertson's popular <span class="italic">History of Charles V</span>. Where Robertson emphasized the gradual improvement of society, Stuart marked out the gradual corruption of feudal institutions, pessimistically attributing this decline to man's inability to alter his destiny. A more direct challenge to Robertson continued in Stuart's next work, <span class="italic">Observations Concerning the Public Law and the Constitutional History of Scotland</span> (1779). Stuart attributed his failure to obtain a university chair in 1778 to Robertson and spared nothing in criticizing his successful <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span>. Stuart's opposition to Catholic relief legislation, which Robertson advocated, also fuelled an attack which continued, though less overtly, in Stuart's <span class="italic">History of the Establishment of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland</span> (1780). In this work and its sequel, <span class="italic">The History of Scotland from the Establishment of the Reformation till the Death of Queen Mary</span> (1782), Stuart altered his style from a conjectural to a more popular narrative model, but one with a difference. Where many contemporary historians emphasized the systematic, the rational, and the pragmatic, Stuart believed that a more sentimental, immediate, and intentional approach could better re-create historical verisimilitude. His compelling portrayal of Mary, queen of Scots, as a victim of both English oppression and self-interested Scottish alliances won him considerable acclaim, particularly south of the border, and the <span class="italic">History</span> was soon reprinted and translated.<br>
<br>Despite this success Stuart received little remuneration from his <span class="italic">History</span>, or indeed from any of his major works. In 1783 he returned to London once again to take up his pen as a critic and political writer. Initially he returned to the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and assisted Murray with his newly established <span class="italic">English Review</span>. But in 1785 the leaders of the opposition&#151;Fox, Burke, and Sheridan&#151;asked him to edit the <span class="italic">Political Herald</span>, in which he orchestrated a vehement attack on William Pitt and his Scottish minister Henry Dundas. However, his tenure as a leading political writer was short-lived. By the spring of 1786 illness, aggravated by dissolute habits, prevented Stuart from working. During the summer his condition grew critical: fluid settled on his lungs, and his body swelled painfully. In late July on a ship to Scotland he sat on deck watching some gambolling seals. &#145;Tell me&#146;, he inquired of the captain, &#145;upon what diet do these creatures feed?&#146; To the answer &#145;Salmon and saltwater&#146;, Stuart replied, &#145;Very good meat but very bad drink&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 2.101). A few weeks later, on 13 August 1786, he died, unmarried, at his parents' home in Fisherrow, Musselburgh. He was buried the following day at the nearby Inveresk churchyard.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> concluded its obituary by dismissing Stuart as &#145;a martyr to intemperance&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1786, 716). Nearly 100 years later Allibone called him a &#145;sot, grumbler, scold and literary Ishmaelite&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 2.2292). Nevertheless a number of Stuart's contemporaries, while acknowledging his personal failings, were more balanced in their judgements: Godwin in the <span class="italic">Political Herald</span> remarked: &#145;If ever any man defended or opposed measures from the genuine sentiments of his heart, it was doctor Stuart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Herald, and Review</span>, 1786, 3281). Boswell wrote: &#145;His bluntness did not please me, though his strong mind did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ominous Years</span>, 305). John Murray, who knew him best, concluded: &#145;He was the greatest enemy to himself. He could not endure to be thought subject to human infirmities&#146;  (John Murray to John Millar, 7 Sept 1786, John Murray archive, NL Scot.).<br>
