<span class="headword">Seddon,  John</span>  (1719&#150;1769), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Lomax Fold, Little Lever, near Bolton, Lancashire, the son of Peter Seddon (1689&#150;1731), dissenting minister at Penrith, Cumberland (1717&#150;19), and later at Cockey Moor, in the parish of Middleton, Lancashire (1719&#150;31). On his father's death Seddon's education was undertaken by the congregation of Cross Street, Manchester. He attended Stand grammar school under William Walker from 1731 to 1733 and subsequently Caleb Rotheram's academy at Kendal, where in 1733 he was one of the first three students to be admitted. He remained there at least until Christmas 1738 before completing his education at Glasgow University, whence he matriculated in 1739, but there is no evidence of him being awarded the MA degree with which he is often credited.<br>
<br>On leaving Glasgow, Seddon became assistant at Cross Street to Joseph Mottershead, and was ordained there on 22 October 1742. In 1743 he married Mottershead's eldest daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1765). He was a preacher of facility and power and was the first minister of Cross Street to preach Socinianism instead of, then the prevalent form of anti-Trinitarianism, Arianism. Joseph Priestley, when a tutor at Warrington Academy (1761&#150;8), spoke of Seddon as &#145;the only Socinian in the neighbourhood&#146;, adding, &#145;we all wondered at him&#146;  (Rutt, 1.59). He embodied his views in a series of six sermons, of which the first was preached on 27 May 1761. In these he declared that the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> provided no foundation for a belief in the Trinity. His utterances caused a good deal of excitement, but while his outspokenness may have won him increased respect it gained him few converts. The sermons were not published until 1793, by which time they were out of date, but they are noteworthy for their time as anticipating the historical argument advanced by Priestley.<br>
<br>Seddon, despite his heterodox views, lived on good terms with neighbouring clergy, especially with John Clayton (1709&#150;1773), the Jacobite fellow of Manchester collegiate church, and with his colleague and father-in-law, Joseph Mottershead. His amiable disposition and charity to the poor made him a popular preacher. He was not, however, a prolific writer, and the sermons mentioned above and a preface to Thomas Dixon's <span class="italic">The Sovereignty of Divine Administration</span> (1766) seem to have been his only publications.<br>
<br>After a long illness Seddon died in Manchester on 22 November 1769, and was buried in Cross Street Chapel. His library was sold on 26 February 1770.<br>
