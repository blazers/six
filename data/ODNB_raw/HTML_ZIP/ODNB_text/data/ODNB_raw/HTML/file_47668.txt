<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mehta, Sir  Pherozeshah Merwanjee</span>  (1845&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician and Indian nationalist</span>, was born on 4 August 1845 in Bombay, the son of Merwanjee Mehta, a successful Parsi merchant. He attended Ayrton's School and, from 1855, Branch School in Bombay. A brilliant student at Elphinstone College of the University of Bombay, Pherozeshah graduated BA in 1864 and won a Dakshina scholarship for an MA which he was permitted to complete in six months, becoming the first Parsi MA and one of the first MAs of the university. He accepted a Rustomjee Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy scholarship to keep terms at Lincoln's Inn in London from 1865 and was called to the bar in 1868. In London he established contact with expatriate Indians, some later to be leading nationalists, including Dadabhai Naoroji, in whose East India Association Mehta became involved. When he returned to India in 1868 Mehta maintained a similar involvement in its Bombay branch as well as in the reformist Bombay Association following its revival in 1867.<br>
<br>On his return to India Mehta won quick success on the appellate side of the Bombay bar and earned rich rewards from representing Indian princes from Gujarat. His lucrative practice supported an aristocratic lifestyle and funded his lifelong commitment to politics. In his chambers opposite the University of Bombay he held regular evening court to discuss current events and devise campaign strategies. In attendance were the cream of the city's established lawyers and politicians, and the most talented younger men, notable among whom in the first decade of the twentieth century was M. A. Jinnah, then a rising lawyer and Congress politician. In private life he had five sons and one daughter from his marriage with Dinbai Behramji Marzban, a granddaughter of Fardoonji Marzban, who started Bombay's first Gujarati newspaper. Immediately after her death in 1907 he married a long-time friend, Aimai Shroff, who survived him by many decades, serving as patron of various Parsi and other charities.<br>
<br>It was in the field of municipal reform that Mehta first made his public mark, when he joined in the agitation for representative municipal government, which led to a new municipal constitution in 1872. He was elected to the Bombay corporation in 1873 and served on it until his death, acting as president or chairman in 1884&#150;6 and 1905&#150;6. His role in municipal politics was such that he was sometimes called the &#145;Uncrowned King of Bombay&#146;, while his brilliant rhetoric and his pugnacious debating style earned him the nickname Pherozeshah the Ferocious. Although he was a significant figure in Bombay life he was on occasion in conflict with the orthodox or more conservative members of his own Parsi community. His attempts to build bridges included his membership of the Parsi masonic lodge, the Lodge Rising Star of Western India, Bombay, and his establishing of the Ripon Club in 1884 as a social link between various sections of the community.<br>
<br>In 1883 Mehta became involved in co-ordinating Indian support for the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> (which enabled Indian judges in the countryside to try cases against Europeans), countering vigorous British opposition throughout India. With two other Bombay luminaries, K. T. Telang and Badruddin Tyabji, he founded the Bombay Presidency Association in 1885. His dominance both of the association and of municipal politics ensured him a voice in Indian political arenas outside the city, in the presidency and elsewhere in India. He was among those instrumental in organizing the first session of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885 and was its president in 1890. Thereafter he dominated Congress politics until the early twentieth century, when political challenges from a new party, popularly known as the extremists, led by B. G. Tilak and others, split Congress in 1907. Mehta's group, the moderates, which included G. K. Gokhale, retained control of the organization until the early years of the First World War, when new political forces moved towards unifying the factions. Mehta died of a heart attack on 5 November 1915 in Bombay before the unification he opposed took place. His political support in the municipality had also been challenged in 1907&#150;8 by a so-called &#145;caucus&#146; led by expatriate Englishmen who objected to his predominance and supported the Bombay municipal commissioner, a European nominee of the government. Mehta survived the challenge in the municipal elections in 1907, as he survived the challenge in Congress, but his power base was weakened. The major political act of his final years was the founding in 1913 of an English-language daily newspaper, the <span class="italic">Bombay Chronicle</span>, to promote a Congress&#151;and Indian&#151;viewpoint.<br>
<br>Though one of India's leading nationalists, Mehta served on the Bombay legislative council from 1886 until his death and on the central legislative council from 1894 to 1896. He was potent as a kind of unofficial opposition in the councils and represented causes other than those of his immediate power bases. Made a CIE in 1895 he was promoted KCIE in 1904. He favoured the constitutional changes initiated by Lord Morley, the secretary of state for India, from 1905 and influenced the negotiations. Mehta's activities have been somewhat overshadowed by later nationalist struggles, but his was a powerful voice which could vigorously oppose British policies and actions and equally energetically lead his fellow Indians in the direction of anti-communal and constitutional politics. He influenced a subsequent generation of politicians and gave strong support in the last decade of his life to M. K. Gandhi and his South African campaigns. He also ensured the successful working of municipal self-government and its impact upon the quality of urban life.<br>
