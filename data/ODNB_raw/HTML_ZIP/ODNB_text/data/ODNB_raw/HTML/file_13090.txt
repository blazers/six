<span class="headword">Heron,  Robert</span>  (1764&#150;1807), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, son of John Heron, a weaver, was born in New Galloway, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 6 November 1764. He was taught privately by his mother until his ninth year, when he was sent to the parish school. He was precocious, and at the age of eleven became a pupil-teacher; at fourteen he was appointed master of the parochial school of Kelton. By the end of 1780 he had saved sufficient money to enable him, with the help of his parents, to enter the University of Edinburgh, with the view of studying for the church. While pursuing his studies he supported himself partly by teaching, but chiefly by working for booksellers. While a divinity student Heron, in the autumn of 1789, paid a visit at Ellisland to Robert Burns, who entrusted him with a letter to Dr Thomas Blacklock, which he failed to deliver. In a rhyming epistle to Blacklock, Burns attributes Heron's faithlessness either to preoccupation with &#145;some dainty fair one&#146;, or to partiality for drink  (<span class="italic">The Poems and Songs of Robert Burns</span>, ed. J. Kinsley, 1968, no. 273b). Heron's <span class="italic">Memoir</span> of Burns (1797), reprinted from articles in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> and published the year after Burns's death, was the first such written and was consequently highly influential throughout the nineteenth century. Modern scholarship has, on the whole, found it inaccurate and regrettable, unfairly portraying the poet as degenerating into as drunken, wayward, and profligate a character as Heron himself.<br>
<br>Heron was for a time assistant to Dr Hugh Blair, the rhetorician, but his habits were already irregular and his interests chiefly literary. Heron's first independent literary venture was a small edition in 1789 of Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span>, with critical comments on his poetry. A larger edition appeared in 1793. In 1790&#150;91 he announced a course of lectures entitled the &#145;Law of nature, the law of nations, the Jewish, the Grecian, the Roman and the canon law, and then on the feudal law&#146;, intended as an introduction to the study of law, but the scheme was unsuccessful. Borne down by drink and debt, he was thrown into prison by his creditors. On their suggestion he undertook a <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> for Morrisons of Perth. After making some progress he was freed from prison on condition of using two-thirds of his remuneration to paying 15<i>s</i>. in the pound. The first volume, which appeared in 1794, was nearly all written in gaol. The <span class="italic">History</span> was completed in six volumes, 1794&#150;9. In 1798 Heron produced at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, a comedy, which was shouted down before the second act. Attributing its failure to a conspiracy against him, he published it as <span class="italic">St Kilda in Edinburgh, or, News from Camperdown, a comic drama in two acts, with a critical preface, to which is added an account of a famous ass race</span> (1798). Being returned as a ruling elder for New Galloway, Heron was for several years a member of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, and frequently spoke&#151;and from time to time preached&#151;with fluency and ability. In 1799 he moved to London, seeking a new start in literature. There he wrote frequently for the periodicals, was for some time editor of <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, the <span class="italic">British Press</span>, and other newspapers, and also acted as a parliamentary reporter.<br>
<br>Despite personal set-backs, Heron, both in Edinburgh and London, maintained a steady flow of publications on a wide variety of subjects. In 1792, his best year, he translated C. Niebuhr's <span class="italic">Travels through Arabia</span> and, from the French, Jacques Cazotte's <span class="italic">Arabian Tales</span> and <span class="italic">Continuations of Arabian Tales</span> (an important source for R. Southey's <span class="italic">Thalaba</span> of 1801), also writing <span class="italic">Elegant Extracts of Natural History</span> and <span class="italic">Observations Made in a Journey through the Western Counties of Scotland in 1792</span> (still an account of interest). In 1794 he published two works on the war against France and <span class="italic">General View of the Natural Circumstances of the Hebrides</span>. He showed an interest in chemistry, translating A. F. Fourcroy's <span class="italic">Chemistry</span> (1796) and writing <span class="italic">Elements of Chemistry</span> in 1800. He published a four-volume <span class="italic">New and complete system of universal geography, to which is added a philosophical view of universal history</span> in 1798, and an edition of the letters of Junius, 1802, in Robert Watt's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica</span>. It is there erroneously credited to John Pinkerton  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 6, 1852, 445); however, Pinkerton himself was the author of <span class="italic">Letters of Literature</span> by &#145;Robert Heron&#146; (1784). Heron also published on the slave trade and other topics, and made other translations. He was employed by Sir John Sinclair during his compilation of the (first) <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span> and contributed to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and to periodicals.<br>
<br>In 1806 Heron began a newspaper entitled <span class="italic">The Fame</span>, which was unsuccessful. Its failure and his improvident habits led to his confinement by his creditors in Newgate prison, where, according to his own statement, he was reduced &#145;to the very extremity of bodily and pecuniary distress&#146;. From Newgate he, on 2 February 1807, wrote a letter to the Literary Fund, recounting his services to literature, and appealing for aid  (printed in Isaac Disraeli, <span class="italic">Calamities of Authors</span>, 1812), and received a grant of &pound;20, though this was insufficient to resolve his financial problems. Attacked by fever, Heron was moved to the hospital of St Pancras, where he died on 13 April 1807. He left a manuscript, &#145;Journal of my conduct&#146;, which was later deposited in the library of the University of Edinburgh.<br>
