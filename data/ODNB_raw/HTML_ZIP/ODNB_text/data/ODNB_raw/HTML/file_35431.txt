</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peake,  Mervyn Laurence</span>  (1911&#150;1968), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born at Kuling (Guling), in the province of Kiang-Hsi, China, on 9 July 1911, the younger son of Ernest Cromwell Peake MD (1874&#150;1949), Congregational missionary doctor, of Tientsin (Tianjin), and his wife, Amanda Elizabeth Powell (1875&#150;1939), a missionary nurse. In 1899 Ernest Peake had travelled to China to establish the first European medical district in Kiang-Hsi province and he took over the Mackenzie Memorial Hospital in Tientsin in 1912, when an uprising against the Manchu dynasty forced the family to flee to Hengchow (Hengyang). Peake was educated at the grammar school in the British Concession in Tientsin. At ten he wrote and illustrated &#145;Ways of travelling&#146;, which was published in the London Missionary Society's magazine <span class="italic">News from Afar</span>.<br>
<br>The family returned to England in 1923 and Peake attended Eltham College, formerly the School for Sons of Missionaries, Kent, from 1923 to 1929, where despite poor academic progress he impressed with his artistic gifts, nurtured by his teacher Eric Drake. Peake attended Croydon School of Art for a few months and then the Royal Academy Schools, where he won the Hacker prize (1931) and had his still life <span class="italic">Cactus</span> accepted by the Royal Academy. During this period Peake collaborated with his friend Gordon Smith on illustrated books, became a stage set designer, and exhibited work with the Soho group and the Twenties group.<br>
<br>With Peake's lack of interest in formal study it was not surprising that in the summer of 1933 he failed his examinations. The Royal Academy terminated Peake's studentship and he was enticed to the isle of Sark by Eric Drake, who had set up an artists' colony there. The first exhibition of the Sark group, in August 1933, attracted much attention and Peake was well represented. During this period in Sark he wore his hair long, had his right ear pierced, and wore a cape, and became briefly engaged to Janice Thomson, an art student from Boston. On the strength of his work he was offered a position at the Westminster School of Art in 1935, where he taught life drawing until 1939. At Westminster, he met Maeve Patricia Mary Theresa Gilmore (1917&#150;1983), artist, then a student, youngest of the six children of Owen Eugene Gilmore MD FRCS; they married on 1 December 1937, and had two sons and a daughter. A solo exhibition of Peake's work in March 1938, which included oils, sketches, and watercolours, and macabre drawings, attracted much attention. In 1939 both Peake and Maeve exhibited in London, and Peake published a book intended for children, <span class="italic">Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor</span> (1939), the illustrations for which, in their characteristic grotesqueness, the <span class="italic">Punch</span> critic considered &#145;unsuitable for sensitive children&#146;. He was also writing poetry, notably &#145;Epstein's Adam&#146; and &#145;Rhondda Valley&#146;, the latter inspired by a visit to the coalmines of south Wales.<br>
<br>In the Second World War Peake served in England in the Royal Artillery (by all accounts he was a hopeless gunner), being later transferred to the Royal Engineers as a bomb expert (he was put on light duties after accidentally setting fire to his barracks). He was invalided out in 1943 after a nervous breakdown. During the early stages of the war Peake worked on <span class="italic">Titus Groan</span>, a book that &#145;grew under duress&#146;  (Gilmore), and Chatto and Windus published <span class="italic">Shapes and Sounds</span> (1941), a volume of his poetry. He also provided the much-admired illustrations for <span class="italic">Ride-a-Cock-Horse and other Nursery Rhymes</span> (1940), which drew out the darkest implications of the stories, and, on the strength of those, for Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">The Hunting of the Snark</span> (1941), where Peake found an absurdist spirit to rival his own. Recovering from his breakdown, he illustrated <span class="italic">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span> (1943); this is considered to be his greatest achievement as an illustrator and he was praised for adding a new spiritual dimension to the work. Other notable illustrations of this period included those for <span class="italic">All This and Bevin Too</span> (1943) for Quentin Crisp. After a year which had been dominated by writing and illustrating Peake was painting again. He thought of himself primarily as a painter even though this is the medium in which he was probably the least visionary.<br>
<br>After the birth of their second son the Peakes settled in Chelsea, London, where they socialized with Dylan Thomas, and Peake was able to consult Graham Greene, then a working director of Eyre and Spottiswoode, over <span class="italic">Titus Groan</span>. Towards the end of the war Eyre and Spottiswoode published <span class="italic">Rhymes without Reason</span>, a small volume of Peake's nonsense verse. While working for the Ministry of Information from 1943 to 1945 he was inspired by glass-blowers making cathode-ray tubes and produced a series of work which was exhibited at the National Gallery. But it was not until just after the end of the war that Peake, after several failed applications, was finally appointed war artist with the rank of captain. On the basis of a caricature of Hitler, and his connection with <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> magazine, for which he regularly illustrated, he was commissioned by <span class="italic">The Leader</span> magazine to tour western Europe with the journalist Tom Pocock. They witnessed the first war crimes trial at Bad Neuenahr in June 1945 and Peake sent back haunting drawings of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and composed a poem, analysing his guilty intrusion on suffering, which was later published as &#145;The Consumptive, Belsen, 1945&#146;. The memories of the two weeks spent in Germany had a profound effect upon Peake; his wife recalled that &#145;he was quieter, more inward-looking, as if he had lost &hellip; his confidence in life itself&#146;  (Watney, 127).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Titus Groan</span> was published in 1946. It was the first in a projected series in which Titus, the seventy-seventh earl of Groan, rebels against his ancestral home Gormenghast Castle and its restrictive duties, and attempts to find a new identity for himself in another land. Although showing the influence of Dickens, Lewis Carroll, and Kafka, the Titus books defy ready classification. The term &#145;fantasy&#146; is perhaps the least inadequate, although Peake's work has nothing of the lightweight or evasive commonly implied by the word: but it is fantasy in being the creation of a fully realized &#145;other&#146; world, ontologically separate from our own. Peake, who was agnostic and apolitical, distanced himself from moral, religious, political, and psychoanalytic interpretations of his work; as Anthony Burgess has commented, Peake's novels &#145;nourish the private imagination&#146;  (Burgess). The strength of <span class="italic">Titus Groan</span> is the thoroughness with which it is imagined (he sometimes drew the characters before writing about them), and the dialectical play throughout of the static, unchanging nature of the castle against the dynamic of the enemies within it. In Gormenghast Peake found the perfect literary expression for his interests as an artist: the arcane diction, the slow, heavily descriptive method of the style, and the delight in the individualities of people and objects are paralleled in the unmoving character of the castle (which has been interpreted as a symbolization of the &#145;labyrinthine human mind&#146;; Irwin)&#151;the obsessive preoccupation with minutiae which epitomizes the ritual laws which govern it, and the eccentric personalities it produces (such as the bloated cook Swelter, the predatory Steerpike, the camp intellectual Prunesquallor, and the power-starved enantiomorphous sisters Cora and Clarice). Gormenghast Castle is the natural home of Peake's imagination, a home to which he was irresistibly drawn, even while as a man and an artist he wished to escape it and explore new worlds. The undertow of Gormenghast drains the life from the portrayal of Titus's rebellion, and the imaginative unity and power of <span class="italic">Titus Groan</span> is increasingly lost in the succeeding volumes. Yet, considered as a whole, the Titus books (which include <span class="italic">Boy in Darkness</span>, a disturbing novella full of menace), remain a massive achievement.<br>
<br>In 1946 Grimm's <span class="italic">Household Tales</span> and Lewis Carroll's Alice books (1946; 1954) were published with Peake's unsentimental illustrations. In the same year Peake returned to Sark with his family, where they spent three serenely happy years in a house that had been the former headquarters of the German occupation, and where Peake wrote a children's book, <span class="italic">Letters from a Lost Uncle from Polar Regions</span> (1948), illustrated <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> (1949), a book close to his heart, and otherwise devoted himself to <span class="italic">Gormenghast</span> (1950), the second Titus book. But a retainer from his publisher and a few commissions could not continue to meet the needs of a growing family, and in 1949 they came back to England, where Peake secured a part-time teaching post in London at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, Holborn; this, together with commissioned paintings and illustrations for books, and to a lesser extent his writing, formed the often uneven ground on which he supported his family. <span class="italic">The Drawings of Mervyn Peake</span> (1949) revealed that Peake's primary concern as an artist was with the human figure, rather than with landscape: of Gormenghast he has left us scarcely a pictorial trace. One of the most frequent and powerful of his effects is the portrayal of the frail verticality of his figures struggling against a dense and crushing atmosphere, or else bent or deformed by it.<br>
<br>In 1951 <span class="italic">Gormenghast</span>, which confounded critics who described it as &#145;wonderfully weird&#146; and the &#145;finest imaginative feat in the English novel since <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Punch</span>), and <span class="italic">The Glassblowers</span> (a collection of poetry based on Peake's war work) won the W. H. Heinemann Foundation prize of &pound;100 and Peake was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature. Peake does not have a clearly defined place in the development of poetry, belonging to neither the Romantic tradition nor to the anti-Romantic. But it was arguably poetry that for Peake was the most moving form of human expression, and he is at his best when an experience and its significance for him are fused, as for instance in &#145;The Glassblowers&#146; or the frightening &#145;Heads Float About Me&#146;, rather than when he reflects on or self-consciously tries to proportion his feelings to his experience. A recurrent motif in his poetry is the idea of a face or body as a building or city, and vice versa: this transference is also seen in the interrelations of Gormenghast and its inhabitants. Peake's poetic voice was, however, largely silent after <span class="italic">The Glassblowers</span>.<br>
<br>After the novel <span class="italic">Mr Pye</span> (1953), about a self-appointed missionary to Sark who grows angel's wings, was ignored or slighted by the critics, Peake developed further interest in the theatre during the 1950s; he wrote at least five plays of which only <span class="italic">The Wit to Woo</span> and <span class="italic">The Connoisseurs</span> were performed. In 1956 he wrote dramatic versions of <span class="italic">Titus Groan</span> and <span class="italic">Mr Pye</span> and a Christmas play for radio. <span class="italic">The Wit to Woo</span>, which was staged at the Arts Theatre Club in London in 1957 and starred Kenneth Williams as Kite, was supposed to solve Peake's financial problems (he had taken on an unmanageable mortgage for a house in Kent), but it was received lukewarmly by the critics (perceived as a light &#145;drawing-room&#146; comedy, it suffered in the wake of the iconoclastic <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> and <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span>) and was a commercial failure. The disappointment induced a nervous breakdown. From this point Peake became increasingly incapacitated by what was eventually diagnosed as a form of Parkinson's disease (it has been conjectured that as a child Peake may have contracted encephalitis lethargica during the &#145;sleeping sickness&#146; epidemic of 1917). He underwent treatment in the Holloway Hospital at Virginia Water for six months in 1958, and was able to complete <span class="italic">Titus Alone</span> (1959). Some critics have read the pared-down and more diffuse style of this final work as a symptom of Peake's progressive degeneration (the novel was revised in 1970 by the science-fiction writer Langdon Jones). But by 1960 he was obliged to give up teaching. There were occasional bursts of creativity: he began <span class="italic">Titus Awakes</span>, the projected fourth volume of the series, and with the help of his wife painstakingly supplied illustrations for his poem <span class="italic">The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb</span>, which when broadcast on BBC radio was received with ecstatic reviews. This marked the beginning of a new spark of interest in Peake's work, in both Britain and America, after years of utter neglect, although by this time Peake was unable to appreciate it. After an operation at the end of 1960 to alleviate his tremors failed in the long term, Peake had spells in various hospitals and nursing homes, and was eventually admitted to The Priory in Roehampton in 1964. He was transferred to a home run by his wife's eldest brother, The Close, near Abingdon in Berkshire, and died there during the night of 16/17 November 1968. He was buried in Burpham churchyard, Sussex.<br>
<br>Tall, thin, dark, and cadaverous, even before the illness which dramatically aged him, Peake was a romantic figure, with a &#145;face that belonged to another age&#146;  (Gilmore, 53), whose passionate and intense nature exhausted him: he lived always on &#145;this desperate edge of now&#146;, and wrote to pour himself forth, to empty himself of all his &#145;golden gall&#146;. In some ways shy and reserved, he was innocently open and generous to all who asked for his help and, despite occasional indiscretions, unremittingly uxorious. In his wife's memoir he emerges as gentle, gracious, prankish, unworldly, and unpractical. He lived in many ways outside convention, behaving in a gently whimsical fashion which puzzled the ordinary. He did not care for &#145;arrangements&#146; in life: he would gather materials for drawings simply by walking the streets of central London and stopping interesting subjects for on-the-spot sketches; and he would write amid his family circle. It was in part Peake's very proximity to and delight in life which produced his fantasy, and his sense of the individual his art of exaggeration: &#145;Anything&#146;, he once said, &#145;seen without prejudice, is enormous.&#146;<br>
<br>Peake left a massive amount of unpublished material and a great deal of work in need of republication. The Penguin editions of the Titus books began to sell immediately to a new, appreciative generation, and his short stories, war poems, radio plays, and nonsense verse were collected in <span class="italic">Peake's Progress</span> (1979). Peake became the subject of theses, a Titus Groan pop group was formed, and in 1975 a Mervyn Peake Society. <span class="italic">Mr Pye</span> was reissued and hailed as a &#145;witty debate about good and evil&#146;  (Watney, 243) and was dramatized on television in 1986. A television series based on the first two Titus books was broadcast by the BBC as their prestige millennium drama in January 2000, and this in turn stimulated renewed interest in Peake as both artist and writer.<br>
