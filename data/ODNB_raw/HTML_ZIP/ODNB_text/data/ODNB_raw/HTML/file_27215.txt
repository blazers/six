<span class="headword">Thomas,  Elizabeth</span>  (1675&#150;1731), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 31 August 1675 and baptized at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 1 September 1675, the only child of Emmanuel Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1677) of the Inner Temple and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1719), daughter of William Osborne of Sittingbourne, Kent. Both parents came from respectable families, but Thomas and her mother had to contend with financial hardship after her father died when she was not yet two. Little is known about Thomas's childhood, but she received some education at home, was well read, and had a little knowledge of French and Latin. Thomas's earliest &#145;claim to fame&#146; was receiving her pen-name, Corinna, from Dryden, with whom she shared a brief correspondence in the last year of his life. She had several literary and material friendships with well-known men and women of her day, including the writers Mary, Lady Chudleigh, John Norris of Bemerton, and the painter Sarah Hoadly, Bishop Hoadly's wife, to name a few. As a gentlewoman who could not always afford to live as one, Thomas used her talent as a writer to obtain patronage from friends and family, which often came in the forms of cash gifts, extended visits, and books.<br>
<br>Thomas's longest correspondence was with her fianc&eacute; of sixteen years, the Gloucester gentleman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11814/', "Richard Gwinnett (1675&#150;1717)")</script>, which ended upon his death on 16 April 1717. Their letters make up the bulk of correspondence in <span class="italic">Pylades and Corinna</span> (1731&#150;2) and <span class="italic">The Honourable Lovers</span> (1732; repr. 1736). Gwinnett was the heir to his father's encumbered estate in Shurdington, Gloucestershire. He studied law at Christ Church, Oxford, and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 22 June 1697. Due to ill health, however, he was unable to practise his profession fully, particularly in London. Their engagement was protracted because neither of them had the means to marry. Denied a union by material circumstances, they continued their engagement through correspondence and annual visits. Both of them gave up lucrative marriage opportunities during the sixteen-year interim because of their mutual devotion. Since she had rejected other suitors in favour of him, Gwinnett partially supported Thomas and her bedridden mother with gifts of money toward the end of his life.<br>
<br>By 1716 Gwinnett pressed for marriage because he felt he could adequately support his bride-to-be and her mother, but Thomas postponed their union so she could nurse her mother, whose death seemed imminent. Ironically, Thomas's mother outlived Gwinnett, who died in the spring of 1717 before he and Thomas could marry. Because of Thomas's long dedication to him, Gwinnett altered his will and bequeathed &pound;600 to her. After Gwinnett's death, however, his younger brother, George, suppressed the will and denied Thomas the money. Hence, in 1718, she initiated what turned out to be a lengthy and costly lawsuit in chancery. Of the &pound;600 Gwinnett bequeathed her, she only received &pound;213 and 6<i>s</i>. for her litigious efforts&#151;not enough to pay off her debts.<br>
<br>The fact that Thomas was active in London and Bath literary circles, particularly between 1696 and 1718, becomes evident from reading her letters and poems. Her reputation as a poet and a wit drew the attention of the <span class="italic">Tatler</span> editor on several occasions. As a writer Thomas experimented with a wide range of forms and genres and had a sound knowledge of history, natural philosophy, classical literature (mostly from translations), and current issues, to which her letters, lyrics, satires, polemics, panegyrics, pastorals, and religious meditations can attest. Like contemporary women writers such as Mary Astell and Mary, Lady Chudleigh, whom she knew, much of her poetry dealt with women's issues. Although she never argued for complete equality between men and women, Thomas believed in women's inherent right to education as well as fair treatment and respect before and after marriage.<br>
<br>Thomas's first known publication was the anonymous poem &#145;To the Memory of the Truly Honoured John Dryden, Esq&#146; which appeared in the commemorative compilation, <span class="italic">Luctus Britannici</span> (1700). Between 1700 and 1722 Thomas followed the long-established tradition of circulating one's poetry among friends and family and apparently did not publish anything. Due to financial problems, which were exacerbated by her disastrous lawsuit, she published <span class="italic">Miscellany Poems on Several Subjects</span> in 1722 anonymously, which was reprinted under the title of <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> in 1726. During a more fortunate time of her life, she had met Alexander Pope through her acquaintance Henry Cromwell. At her request, Cromwell had given her some letters which had passed between himself and Pope from 1708 to 1711. In her impoverished state in the 1720s, Thomas realized she might profit from the sale of these letters, since Pope's literary reputation had, by that time, greatly increased. Hence in 1726 she sold them for 10 guineas to the notorious bookseller Edmund Curll, who knew their potential value and promptly published them in <span class="italic">Miscellanea in Two Volumes</span> (1726).<br>
<br>Pope took his revenge in his 1728 satire, <span class="italic">The Dunciad: an Heroic Poem</span>. In book two, while describing a race between Curll and his rival bookseller, Bernard Lintott, Pope satirizes both Curll and Thomas (&#145;Curll's Corinna&#146;). Her reputation never fully recovered after this scandal, since literary historians were quick to assume the worst about her character. In addition to the Pope&#150;Cromwell letters, Thomas seems to have sold quite a few papers to Curll in 1726 because, from that date forward, her writings and correspondence can be found scattered throughout many of Curll's publications such as <span class="italic">Poetical Works of Philip Late Duke of Wharton</span> (1726) and <span class="italic">Atterburyana</span> (1727). The satire attributed to Thomas, called <span class="italic">Codrus, or, &#145;The Dunciad&#146; Dissected</span>, was first published in 1728. Thomas's account of Dryden's funeral appeared in the 1729 publication of the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Amours of William Congreve Esq</span>. This text, however, was thoroughly discredited by Edmond Malone in <span class="italic">The Critical and Miscellaneous Prose Works of John Dryden</span> (3 vols., 1800, 1.337&#150;419). Curll also printed her <span class="italic">Metamorphosis of the Town</span> anonymously in 1730 (repr. 1731, 1732). The bulk of her correspondence which had been published previously by Curll was consolidated in <span class="italic">Pylades and Corinna</span> and <span class="italic">The Honourable Lovers</span>.<br>
<br>Despite her efforts to settle her debts, especially after her lawsuit in the early 1720s Thomas's financial situation worsened. She attempted to hide from her creditors but she was discovered and thrown into Fleet prison in 1727 for three years. A warrant was issued for her release in June 1729 under an <span class="roman">Act of Insolvency</span>, but she was not released until the middle of 1730, presumably because she could not pay her gaoler's fees. She died on 3 February 1731, and was buried two days later in the churchyard of St Bride's, Fleet Street. Margaret, Lady De La Warr, the daughter-in-law of Thomas's former patron, Anne, Lady Dowager De Le Warr, paid for her burial.<br>
<br>After Thomas died Curll continued to publish a scattering of her texts as he had in the late 1720s as well as reissuing both volumes of <span class="italic">Pylades and Corinna</span> and <span class="italic">The Honourable Lovers</span> in 1736. In 1743 the fourth and final edition of <span class="italic">Metamorphosis</span> was printed for J. Wilford, with Thomas's name on the title-page for the first time. The inscription read &#145;By the late celebrated Mrs. ELIZABETH THOMAS, Who has so often obliged the Town, under the Name of CORINNA&#146;. Thomas's works went out of print thereafter but have had brief appearances in biographical dictionaries and anthologies over the next three centuries.<br>
