<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Winstedt, Sir  Richard Olaf</span>  (1878&#150;1966), <span class="occ">civil servant and Malay scholar</span>, was born in North Parade, Oxford, on 2 August 1878, one of at least two sons of a naturalized Swede, Isaac Olof Winstedt, tailor and outfitter, and his wife, Sarah Mary Castell, who belonged to an old-established Oxford family. He was originally named Richard Olof but changed the spelling of his second name to Olaf. His younger brother Eric became a don. Winstedt was educated at Magdalen College School and at New College, Oxford. Goitre barred him from athletics. After getting a second in honour moderations (1899) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1901) and taking the civil service examination, he was in 1902 appointed to the Federated Malay States civil service (later to be merged into the Malayan civil service) and was posted to Perak, a state which had come under British protection only twenty-eight years previously and in which he was to spend ten years. With encouragement from the British resident, Sir Ernest Birch, and his secretary, R. J. Wilkinson, a distinguished Malay scholar, Winstedt made himself familiar with the charming and interesting Malay people and wrote four books in a government-published series called <span class="roman">Papers on Malay Subjects</span>: <span class="italic">Folk Literature</span> (1907), <span class="italic">The Circumstances of Malay Life</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Arts and Crafts</span> (1909), and <span class="italic">Fishing, Hunting and Trapping</span> (1911). Of these subjects folk literature was the one which was to engage his interest most.<br>
<br>A little later, in collaboration with A. J. Sturrock, Winstedt went on to publish four Malay texts collected from an old traditional story-teller named Pawang Ana; a collection of farcical tales from other Perak story-tellers; and some articles in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the Straits branch (later Malayan branch) of the Royal Asiatic Society, a publication to which he was to contribute many times in the course of his life. At this point Winstedt fell ill and was for a long time in a primitive hospital cut off from all books of reference except a few Malay classics which he found it an amusement to parse and analyse. On release from hospital he obtained his first home leave and took his notes to Europe for consultation with the established authorities, most of whom were Dutch. The result was the publication in 1913 of Winstedt's <span class="italic">Malay Grammar</span>, which established his reputation as a scholar. He returned to Malaya and was appointed district officer in Kuala Pilah, an interesting district which contained the court of the Yangdipertuan Besar of the Negri Sembilan and also five little states which followed the local version of Minangkabau matrilineal law. He studied customary law; published more texts and, with Wilkinson, a collection of Malay quatrains, <span class="italic">Pantun Melayu</span> (1914); and also carried his language work further in writing <span class="italic">Colloquial Malay: a Simple Grammar with Conversations</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">An English&#150;Malay Dictionary</span> (3 vols., 1914&#150;17).<br>
<br>In 1916 Winstedt, one of whose appointments in Perak had been as inspector of schools, returned to the education department, and was stationed in Singapore for fifteen years. His first title was assistant director of education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States, and his task was to improve the existing system of education in Malay. He visited Java and the Philippines to study educational systems there and later submitted a report which resulted in 1922 in the closing of two older teacher-training colleges and the founding of the Sultan Idris Training College at Tanjong Malim. Attached to this college was the Malay Translation Bureau, designed not only to prepare textbooks but also to provide literature for the graduates of schools which taught only in Malay. Through the college and the bureau Winstedt was later able not only to improve school education but also to guide the development of the language to cope with modern needs. The education he introduced was based on the traditional values and virtues of Malay rural life. After the independence of Malaya he was attacked for failing to try to direct Malay attitudes towards economic competition with the Chinese and Indians of Malaya, but there are two sides to this question.<br>
<br>Winstedt's sojourn in Singapore led to one of his most productive periods of spare-time writing. In 1920 alone he published two books&#151;<span class="italic">A Dictionary of Colloquial Malay</span> and a Malay text&#151;and no fewer than twenty-three articles covering history, folklore, ethnology, philosophy, literature, and bibliography. He obtained his DLitt, Oxford, in that year. In 1921 he started a ten-year period as first president of Raffles College, Singapore, an institution which, with the King Edward VII College of Medicine, was to grow into the University of Malaya. On 2 March the same year Winstedt married Dr Sarah Mary Josephine O'Flynn (1886&#150;1972), of the Malayan medical service, the daughter of a wool-miller of co. Clare [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104524/', "Winstadt, Sarah")</script>]. There were no children.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1931 Winstedt was director of education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States, and a member of the legislative council of the Straits Settlements. In 1925 he published <span class="italic">Shaman, Saiva and Sufi</span>, a study of the evolution of Malay magic. In 1926 he was appointed CMG. In 1931 he was promoted to be general adviser to the unfederated state of Johore, an appointment which he held for the last four years of his service in Malaya. This seems to have stimulated his interest in history and, in addition to many shorter writings, he published <span class="italic">A Malay History of Riau and Johore</span>, Raja Haji Ali's <span class="italic">Tuhfat al-Nafis</span>&#151;Malay text with English summary (1932); his own original <span class="italic">History of Johore, 1365&#150;1895</span> (1932); histories of Selangor and Negri Sembilan (1934), and <span class="italic">The History of Malaya</span> (1935).<br>
<br>In 1935 Winstedt retired from the Malayan civil service and was appointed KBE. He then took up an appointment as lecturer in Malay at the School of Oriental Studies, University of London. In 1937 he was promoted to a readership which he held until he retired in 1946, having been elected fellow of the British Academy the previous year.<br>
<br>London brought Winstedt into contact with original Malay manuscripts, especially those in the Raffles collection of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1938 he published in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the Malay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society a romanized and annotated text of the Raffles manuscript of the <span class="italic">Malay Annals</span>, which differed in important respects from versions previously published and opened up interesting possibilities. The following year he published <span class="italic">A History of Malay Literature</span>, which co-ordinated the research of a lifetime in this field. Then came the war and its aftermath. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya Winstedt's Malay language broadcasts helped to keep hope alive in that country; and just after the re-occupation his letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, written in conjunction with Sir Cecil Clementi and Sir Frank Swettenham, led to the reversal of the British government's Malayan union policy and the institution of a federal government which was to guide Malaya to independence twelve years later.<br>
<br>Between 1947 and his death nineteen years later Winstedt published <span class="italic">The Malays: a Cultural History</span> (Singapore, 1947), six new dictionaries, several new editions of his more important books, and many articles and reviews. In 1951 he received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Malaya. During the last years of his life he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the service of the Royal Asiatic Society, of which he was either director or president from 1940 to 1964 and a regular voluntary helper even after that. His eighty-fifth birthday was honoured with no fewer than three Festschriften. His great contribution to scholarship was the unearthing and fostering of the cultural heritage of the Malays of Malaya, but he left later scholars to deal with his subjects in greater detail. His publications numbered more than 340. Winstedt died in Putney Hospital, south-west London, on 2 June 1966.<br>
