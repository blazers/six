<span class="headword">Coronio <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ionides]</span>,  Aglaia</span>  (1834&#150;1906), <span class="occ">embroiderer, bookbinder, and art patron</span>, was the second child and elder daughter of Alexander Ionides (1810&#150;1890) and his wife, Euterpe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sgouta (<i>b</i>. 1816), who was described in George Du Maurier's novel <span class="italic">Trilby</span> (1894) as &#145;so beautiful and stately and magnificently attired&#146;  (Ormond, 100). Alexander emigrated to England from Greece in 1827 to work in the Manchester business started by his father, Constantine Ionidis Iplikzis (1775&#150;1852), which exported cottons to Turkey and Greece and imported a variety of goods into Britain. Alexander became a British subject and took an Anglicized surname from Ionidis. In later life he became managing director of the Banque of Constantinople and director of the Crystal Palace Company. From 1840 the Ionides family lived in Tulse Hill, London, moving in 1864 to a large house at 1 Holland Park. Both homes became the headquarters for a group of wealthy, influential Anglo-Greek families and through their interest and patronage of the arts, centres for artistic London society. The Ionides women were admired for their independent personalities and striking looks, especially Aglaia, who was tall and slender with a pale face and haunting black eyes; she, her equally beautiful cousin Maria Zambaco, and Marie Spartali, another member of London's Anglo-Greek circle, were known as &#145;the three graces&#146;. They were painted by D. G. Rossetti, G. F. Watts, and notably by Edward Burne-Jones in <span class="italic">The Mill</span>, completed between 1870 and 1882 (V&amp;A).<br>
<br>From 1854 to 1866 Alexander Ionides served as the Greek consul-general in London, Aglaia acting as his official hostess. She became known as one of the most gracious, intelligent, and witty women of the period. After her marriage in 1855 to Theodore John Coronio (<i>c</i>.1828&#150;1903) Aglaia lived at 1 Lindsey Row, moving in 1869 next to her parents at 1A Holland Park. Her daughter, Calliope, was born in 1856 and her son, John, a year later. She became a keen patron of the arts owning works by Rossetti, Whistler, and Fantin-Latour and she practised the arts of bookbinding and embroidery. The only known existing example of her work is a pair of embroidered curtains designed by William Morris in the 1870s. These and their design, which is marked with her name, are owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
<br>Aglaia Coronio and William Morris became close friends and their long-lasting correspondence illustrates how deeply Morris confided in her. He visited her frequently and encouraged her artistic pursuits. In a letter to his wife, Jane, in 1870 he refers to her making &#145;quite a fine thing&#146; of bookbinding  (Kelvin, 1.128). He supplied her with embroidery threads and she, in return, secured for him samples of the rare, red dye kermes, and packets of unspun Levantine wool. Her refined tastes were also invaluable in the selection and arranging of textiles and drapery in the paintings of Edward Burne-Jones, another of her prodigies.<br>
<br>References to Aglaia's melancholic character portend her dramatic and tragic end. On 20 August 1906, the day following the death of her daughter, she committed suicide at her home in London by repeatedly stabbing herself in the neck and chest with her embroidery scissors.<br>
