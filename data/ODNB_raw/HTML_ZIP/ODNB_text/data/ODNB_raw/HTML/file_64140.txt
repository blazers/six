<span class="headword">Townsend,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1787), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 8 February 1737 at St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, the eldest surviving son of Chauncy Townsend (<i>bap</i>. 1708, <i>d</i>. 1770), MP, and Bridget, daughter of James Phipps of Wiltshire. His father was a London entrepreneur with interests ranging from linen drapery to coal mines. Townsend did not follow his father into business, for, after attending Hertford College, Oxford, in 1756, he achieved financial independence by his marriage on 3 May 1763 to Rosa Peregrina du Plessis (1745&#150;1785), the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12300/', "Henry Hare, third and last Baron Coleraine (1693&#150;1749)")</script>, antiquary, and Rose du Plessis 
    (or Duplessis; 1710&#150;1790)
  . Townsend secured possession of Hare's estate in Tottenham, Middlesex, which had escheated to the crown on his death on the grounds that his daughter was an alien.<br>
<br>Townsend sought a political career, and soon formed a connection with Lord Shelburne, whose influence as secretary of state in the Chatham ministry of 1766&#150;8 enabled him to enter parliament for the government borough of West Looe at a by-election in 1767 and to retain the seat at the 1768 general election [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95095', "Chathamites")</script>]. In that year Shelburne went into opposition; possession of a government seat did not inhibit Townsend from doing likewise. In 1769 he was involved in a scheme of Shelburne's to split East India Company stock to influence the choice of directors, and he helped Shelburne to meet the financial losses caused by a fall in the stock price.<br>
<br>Townsend was a vigorous supporter of John Wilkes during the Middlesex election case of 1768&#150;9, and proposed Wilkes for re-election after his first expulsion. He was a founder member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentleman Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script>, formed in February 1769 to support Wilkes, and Wilkite power in the City of London brought him election in June 1769 as a lifetime alderman and annual sheriff. But Townsend was one of those who wished to make the society a radical organization and not merely a milch-cow for Wilkes to exploit, and, with other Shelburne men, he seceded under John Horne in April 1771 to form a new Constitutional Society. In City politics this radical split let in a government supporter as lord mayor in 1771, and so in 1772 Wilkes stood with Townsend on a joint ticket, for the mayor was chosen by the court of aldermen from the two top candidates. Townsend's role was merely to facilitate the election of Wilkes, but he played Wilkes false. Always ambitious for a leading position in London politics, in 1771 he had won cheap popularity by refusing to pay land tax on his Tottenham estate, claiming that Wilkes's exclusion left Middlesex unrepresented in parliament; as a result he had suffered distraint on his goods to the value of &pound;200. Now, in 1772, a coalition of Hornites and courtiers secured his election as mayor. The resulting animosity between the two men led Townsend, according to Horace Walpole, to become &#145;as active an enemy of Wilkes as the Scotch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 1.250). His treachery led to a riot on his lord mayor's day, and made him so unpopular in London that when he was due to forfeit his government seat at the 1774 general election, and appeared on the hustings, vehement abuse forced his withdrawal.<br>
<br>By the late 1770s mutual self-interest led surviving London radicals to re-unite, and Townsend canvassed for Wilkes in his successful election as city chamberlain in 1779. But he did not seek re-election to parliament until Shelburne returned him for his pocket borough of Calne in April 1782. He then again displayed his radical credentials by speaking for both parliamentary reform and annual parliaments, the latter a cause he had championed in the 1770s. He supported both Shelburne and Pitt against the Fox&#150;North coalition of 1783, but voted against the subsequent Pitt ministry on several occasions. On 9 May 1787 he strongly opposed the impeachment of Warren Hastings, as a man who deserved not the condemnation but the thanks of his country. The diarist Nathaniel Wraxall recalled that &#145;though he seldom mingled in debate, he manifested whenever he spoke a manly mind, great facility of expression, strong sense, combined with upright principles of action&#146;  (Wraxall, 2.329). Townsend died at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, his residence, on 1 July 1787, after a cold turned into fever; he was buried privately in the churchyard of Tottenham church. His wife had died on 8 November 1785 and he was survived by their son, Henry Hare Townsend, and daughter.<br>
