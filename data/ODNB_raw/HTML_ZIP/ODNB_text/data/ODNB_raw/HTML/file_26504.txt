<span class="headword">Stewart,  Robert</span>, first earl of Orkney  (1533&#150;1593), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born in the spring of 1533, the third or fourth of the seven known illegitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V, king of Scots (1512&#150;1542)")</script>. His mother was Euphemia Elphinstone (<i>b</i>. 1509, <i>d</i>. after 1564), who went on to marry John Bruce of Cultmalindie; the son of their marriage, Laurence Bruce, became notorious for oppression in Shetland under Robert's general sway.<br>
<br>Like his half-brothers, Robert Stewart was granted ecclesiastical preferment, receiving the <i>commenda</i> of the abbey of Holyrood at the age of five, including the regality and barony of Broughton, the burgh of the Canongate, and the baronies of Whitekirk, the Kerse, and Ogleface. All these lay along the south side of the Forth between Grangemouth and Dunbar. He was also given the barony of Dunrod near Kirkcudbright. Stewart was educated in the diocese of St Andrews (<i>c</i>.1534&#150;1548) and at the French court (1548&#150;51). During the 1550s he is glimpsed at the Scottish court, generally under the influence of his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26479/', "Lord James Stewart, later earl of Moray")</script>, with whom in 1557 he joined the protestant lords of the congregation in opposition to the regent, Mary of Guise. During the Reformation crisis he changed sides twice and earned himself a reputation for untrustworthiness. When Queen Mary returned to Scotland in 1561, he was among the first to greet her, and he, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26490/', "Lord John Stewart")</script>, Lord James, and their sister Jean attended her thereafter. In December 1561 Robert married Jean Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1598), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15368/', "Gilbert Kennedy, third earl of Cassillis")</script>; they had eight children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26500/', "Patrick Stewart")</script>, his successor as earl.<br>
<br>Robert Stewart became for a time a hanger-on of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, Queen Mary's second husband, and was knighted by him in 1565, receiving a regrant of a previous charter of the lordship and barony of Strathdon. The queen's estrangement from Darnley harmed Robert's fortunes, however, and he took little direct part in the events of 1566&#150;7, though he and his sister were with the queen when her secretary, David Rizzio, was murdered on 9 March 1566 by a gang including Patrick Bellenden of Stenness, later a lifelong adversary.<br>
<br>In December 1564 Stewart was given a privy seal charter of the royal and earldom lands in Orkney and Shetland. His interest in these islands almost certainly derived from the families who were his Holyrood vassals: the Bellendens, in particular Sir John Bellenden of Auchnoull, the justice clerk, and his brother Patrick; and the Sinclairs, notably Sir Oliver Sinclair of Pitcairns and Whitekirk, a member of the old Orkney earldom family and a former favourite of Stewart's father. In 1558 Adam Bothwell, bishop of Orkney, had feued off&#151;granted in exchange for payments, usually of grain, butter, and other goods&#151;large portions of bishopric land to his relatives of both houses. Presumably the possibilities suggested by this also excited Stewart's interest, but for three years he was unable to take advantage of his grant, owing to the turbulence of events at court.<br>
<br>Stewart finally arrived in Orkney in October 1567 and immediately started to make himself master of the islands. He pressured Bishop Bothwell into parting with unfeued bishopric land in exchange for those of Holyrood, except for those of the Kerse, which were exchanged with Sir John Bellenden for his lands of Birsay, an ancient bishopric centre. Also, with less success, Stewart sought to wrest feued land from Sir Patrick Bellenden and Gilbert Balfour of Westray, Adam Bothwell's brother-in-law. Both Bishop Bothwell and Sir John Bellenden felt that they had been cheated, and Stewart was pursued for the rest of his life in search of redress. In the early 1570s Sir John found the ear of the regent, Morton, and Stewart was warded in Edinburgh and Linlithgow and forced to part with large sums of money. It was probably at Morton's behest that investigations were carried out in Orkney and Shetland into allegations of abuse and oppression, both by Stewart himself and by his half-brother Bruce of Cultmalindie. The complaints against Stewart are a mixed bag: increasing and misusing taxes and the Norse law of the islands and, more seriously, treason in his dealings with Denmark, erstwhile overlord of the islands, to whom he was alleged to have offered them. But the record of the investigation into Cultmalindie's doings in Shetland (republished in 1999) provides an extraordinary insight into the Shetland society of the time; the commons, publicly assembled, testified in great detail to Bruce's abuses of weights, measures, and other customs.<br>
<br>Despite this, Stewart managed to escape blame. He had attracted the favour of the young king James VI, and in 1581, shortly after Morton's fall, he was created earl of Orkney and lord of Shetland. This did not end his feud with the Bellendens, however, since Sir Lewis Bellenden had inherited his late father's cause. Stewart's unscrupulous and treacherous nature became evident to the king, and Bellenden, allied with the secretary John Maitland of Thirlestane, prevailed upon James to revoke Stewart's earldom grant on coming of age in 1587. An expedition under Sir Patrick Bellenden to bring Stewart to justice was unsuccessful, but the latter was forced to feu off estates in order to meet the large sums demanded of him, including land intended for his wife's marriage portion. Latterly he was greatly impoverished, and his earldom had passed in all but name to his second son, Patrick; his eldest, Henry, had died in 1585.<br>
<br>Stewart died on 4 February 1593 in the Palace of the Yards in Kirkwall and was buried in St Magnus Cathedral, though the site of his tomb is lost. He had three known mistresses, with all of whom he had children, in particular Marjorie Sandilands, wife of the laird of Avochie, mother of three sons and two daughters. These infidelities, coupled with difficulties over her marriage settlement, proved too much for Stewart's wife, and at the time of his death she was suing him for divorce on the grounds of adultery. His relations with his sons were also difficult. His original heir, Henry Sinclair, died amid allegations of a treacherous liaison with the earl of Caithness, a long-standing opponent of whoever controlled Orkney and Shetland, and the earl tried to have Patrick sent home to Orkney by his tutor, Patrick Waus of Barnbarroch, so that he could keep an eye on him there.<br>
<br>Robert Stewart's chief monument in Orkney and Shetland is the palace which he built at Birsay. Though now ruinous and architecturally overshadowed by his son's achievements, it was for its time an impressive and civilized building.<br>
