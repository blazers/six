<span class="headword">Keppel,  George Thomas</span>, sixth earl of Albemarle  (1799&#150;1891), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of William Charles Keppel, fourth earl of Albemarle (1772&#150;1849), and his first wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Southwell (<i>d</i>. 1815), daughter of Lord de Clifford, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15441/', "George Keppel, third earl of Albemarle")</script>, was born in Marylebone, Middlesex, on 13 June 1799. His childhood was passed with his grandmother, the Dowager Lady de Clifford, then governess to Princess Charlotte of Wales. The princess, three years his senior, often tipped him liberally. He was at Westminster School from the age of nine until nearly sixteen, but was an indifferent student. When Dr Page, the headmaster, pronounced him unfit for any learned profession, an ensigncy was obtained for him in the 3rd battalion of the 14th regiment. The battalion, consisting chiefly of untried officers and raw recruits, was in the Netherlands, and Keppel, whose commission was dated 4 April 1815, joined it in time to be present at the battle of Waterloo, where he was in the thick of the fighting on the ridge. Footsore and ragged, he marched with the victorious troops to Paris. He returned home with the battalion at the end of the year, and when it was disbanded served with the 2nd battalion of the regiment in the Ionian Islands. This battalion was disbanded at Chichester in 1818, when Keppel was appointed to the 22nd (Cheshire) regiment, with which he served in Mauritius and at the Cape, returning home with the regiment in 1819. For a time he was equerry to the duke of Sussex.<br>
<br>In 1821 Keppel was promoted to a lieutenancy in the 24th regiment, was transferred to the 20th, and ordered to India. There he served as aide-de-camp to the governor-general, the marquess of Hastings, but on Hastings's resignation in 1823 he obtained leave to return home overland. Relying on a slight knowledge of Persian acquired during the long passage out to India, he visited the ruins of Babylon and the court of Tehran, from there journeying to England by way of Baku, Astrakhan, Moscow, and St Petersburg, then a rare feat. His published account is an interesting book. Keppel next served as aide-de-camp to the Marquess Wellesley when lord lieutenant of Ireland. He obtained a company in the 62nd (Wiltshire) regiment in 1825, and after studying at the senior department of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, obtained a majority on half pay unattached on 20 March 1827. He was not on full pay again, but he rose steadily, finally attaining the honorary rank of general (on half pay of his former commission) on 7 February 1874. In 1829 he visited the theatre of war between the Russians and Turks, was with the English fleet in Turkish waters, visited Constantinople and Adrianople, and travelled in the Balkans. Keppel married on 4 June 1831 Susan (<i>d</i>. 3 Aug 1885), third daughter of Sir Coutts Trotter, bt; they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15444/', "William Coutts Keppel, seventh earl of Albemarle")</script>, and four daughters, of whom two predeceased their parents.<br>
<br>In 1832 Keppel was returned as a whig MP for East Norfolk in the first reformed parliament, and sat until 1835. In 1837 he unsuccessfully contested Lyme Regis, and in 1841 Lymington. In 1846 he became one of the private secretaries to Lord John Russell, the new premier, and in 1847 was returned for Lymington, for which he sat until 1849, the year of his father's death. On the death of his insane brother, Augustus Frederick, the fifth earl, on 15 March 1851, he succeeded to the title. He was appointed a trustee of Westminster School in 1854, in succession to the first marquess of Anglesey, and was long the &#145;father of the trust&#146;. He was a familiar and popular figure in London society. He retained his faculties to the end, and held receptions on each anniversary of Waterloo, at his daughter's house in Portman Square.<br>
<br>Albemarle's publications included <span class="italic">Personal Narrative of a Journey from India to England</span> (2 vols., 1825), <span class="italic">Narrative of a Journey Across the Balkans &hellip; and a Visit to &hellip; Newly Discovered Ruins in Asia Minor</span> (1830), and <span class="italic">Fifty Years of my Life</span> (1876). Some of his speeches in the House of Lords, including those on the <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span> and on torture in the Madras presidency, both in 1856, were printed as pamphlets.<br>
<br>Albemarle died at his London residence, 8 Portman Square, Marylebone, on 21 February 1891, and was buried at Quidenham, Norfolk.<br>
