<span class="headword">Beaton,  Donald</span>  (1802&#150;1863), <span class="occ">gardener</span>, was born on 8 March 1802, &#145;about sixteen miles from the then parish church of Urray, in Strathconon, Rosshire&#146;  (Beaton, &#145;Autobiography&#146;), the son of Donald Beaton. While Beaton was small his father moved the family to Inverness, where he was acting manager for a cattle dealer, grazing animals on lands rented from Lord Lovat around Beaufort Castle. In the summer months the family migrated up to summer pastures at Corycharbie, where highland sports like deer stalking, grouse shooting, and fly fishing took place.<br>
<br>Beaton, an intelligent boy who spoke Gaelic and learned Latin before he could speak English, was often too far from schools to benefit from regular education in summertime, instead learning how to tan leather and make fishing lines, to dye yarns with lichens, and to clean rifles and shoot deer. He acted as a young gamekeeper for Lord Lovat. An interest in the history of the highlands encouraged him to want to become a cavalry officer, but his mother wanted him to enter the church. She died when Beaton was seven, and his father employed a tutor for the five children; Beaton was determined to join &#145;the kirk or the camp&#146; and to become a gentleman. A series of hard winters and harvests bankrupted many of the cattle dealers, and, as his father was now short of money, for a brief period Beaton acted as a tutor to the children of Lord Lovat's manager at Beaufort Castle. He attended Inverness Academy for two sessions, intending to try for a bursary to King's College, Aberdeen. Though clever, he was still not a fluent English speaker and, owing to the curious manner in which the top of the class was selected, he was unable to gain a bursary.<br>
<br>Beaton was set to work in the gardens of Beaufort Castle until &#145;something cast up&#146;, and he was allowed to work with the gamekeepers from 12 August every summer  (Beaton, &#145;Autobiography&#146;). Abandoning his dream of becoming a gentleman, he decided to embrace the career of horticulture. The castle gardeners resented his fast track to the brotherhood of gardeners, since they had had to be apprenticed. But he learned about vine growing from Niven of Bothwell Castle, and the Linnean system; he joined the staff of Sir William Cumming Gordon of Altyre, near Forres, where within a year he had gained sufficient knowledge of the plants to be put in charge of them. Probably under the influence of Lady Cumming Gordon, he began one of his two main interests in gardening&#151;that of crossing (interbreeding) bedding plants and bulbs. The other interest lay in colour.<br>
<br>Beaton then went to Perth, &#145;the best neighbourhood in Scotland for good gardening&#146;, where he joined the staff of the nursery of Dickson and Turnbull for two years, and then to the gardens of the Caledonian Horticultural Society in Edinburgh. Deciding to go south, he set off by boat, but was disappointed by the sight of London, where he worked for six weeks at Clapton nursery, before moving west to Haffield, near Ledbury in Herefordshire, where his employer encouraged both his interest in botany and his absence to see as many gardens as he could. Young gentlemen of the time ventured on the grand tour of Europe; Beaton, unable to become a gentleman, visited gardens instead. In 1832 he &#145;travelled 3,000 miles in England alone&#146; and saw:<blockquote>all the Crinums at Wentworth House, the number of pot plants at Chatsworth &hellip; the best Orangery in England, near Prescot; the first Petunia that flowered in England, at Lower Boughton, near Manchester; the celebrated rock garden of Lady Boughton, near Chester; the first of the Calceolarias in the Epsom Nursery; the Geranium houses of Sir Richard Hoar, near Bath &hellip; a wagon load of dried bulbs, and the Pinetum, at Dropmore. (Beaton, &#145;Autobiography&#146;)</blockquote>After that he made his way round Scotland. At the same time he managed to continue his work crossing &#145;all sorts of plants&#146;, and cultivated forty-six sorts of grapes.<br>
<br>After the death of Gordon, his employer at Haffield, Beaton was taken on in the early 1830s as head gardener of Shrubland Park in Suffolk by Sir W. F. F. Middleton, baronet, whom he thanked for encouraging his flower gardening; Beaton later wrote articles in <span class="italic">The Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">The Cottage Gardener</span> (1850, 1853, and 1855) describing his work there. He married at Eastnor, Herefordshire, on 8 November 1837 Lydia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Penn (<i>d</i>. 1850). Following her death he married, as his second wife, on 1 February 1851, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of Thomas Parfett, horse dealer. There were no children.<br>
<br>Shrubland Park was Beaton's last position as a head gardener; he retired in 1852, aged fifty, and moved to Surbiton in Surrey, where a well-wisher gave him a garden. He continued to write a weekly column in the <span class="italic">Cottage Gardener</span> (which became the <span class="italic">Journal of Horticulture</span>, and in 1861 <span class="italic">Cottage Gardener and Country Gentleman</span>), and contributed to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span> until his death, becoming &#145;the main publicist of the bedding system&#146; of planting  (Elliott, <span class="italic">Victorian Gardens</span>, 89). Beaton's comments on the flowers he noticed in his tour of gardens&#151;geraniums (pelargoniums), petunias, calceolarias&#151;suggest his interest in colour. In the 1850s he contributed to the debate about bedding plants and colour; he suggested that it was wise to look at different colours in different lights to see which arrangements worked best, and that there should be a neutral colour in the centre of a group. When Michel-Eug&egrave;ne Chevreul produced his theory of complementary colours in 1839 and 1849 for the Gobelin tapestries (<span class="italic">De la loi du contraste simultan&eacute; des couleurs</span>) John Lindley picked up the theme to relate it to the garden and the massing of plants of different colours next to each other. Beaton, however, argued that green would cancel out the so-called effect of complementary colours, and after much debate in the journals this was accepted.<br>
<br>Beaton had successfully hybridized scarlet pelargoniums, among others. However his writing on the cross-breeding of plants, and especially his criticism of the hybridization experiments of the German botanist Karl von G&auml;rtner, &#145;evidently knowing nothing of his work&#146;, led Charles Darwin to describe Beaton as &#145;a clever, but d-d cocksure man&#146; whose own experimental results were unlikely to be reliable  (Darwin to Hooker, 14 May 1861, <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Charles Darwin</span>, ed. F. Burkhardt and S. Smith, 16 vols., 1985&#150;, 9.127). Beaton's apology to Darwin for inadvertently upsetting him was published posthumously in the <span class="italic">Journal of Horticulture</span> (3 Nov 1863). Beaton died at his home in Victoria Road, Surbiton, Surrey, on 31 October 1863, following a stroke.<br>
