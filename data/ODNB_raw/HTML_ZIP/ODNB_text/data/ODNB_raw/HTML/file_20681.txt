<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Joshua</span>  (1656&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Carsington, Derbyshire, on 2 December 1656, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20679/', "John Oldfield (1626/7&#150;1682)")</script> and his wife, Ann, daughter of William Porter, a musician of Nottingham. His father was the rector of Carsington until he was ejected from the living in 1662, after which he continued to preach at presbyterian conventicles. Joshua received his early education from his father, and the family lived in the area of Alfreton, Derbyshire. In the 1670s he studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, which he entered as a sizar in February 1674, and also at Lincoln College, Oxford, and Christ's College, Cambridge. He did not take a degree, however, as he refused to subscribe to the articles of the church. Oldfield followed his father into the ministry as a presbyterian, for which he prepared at John Shuttlewood's academy at Sulby, Northamptonshire. He became private chaplain to Sir John Gell at Hopton Hall, Derbyshire, and later tutor to the son of Paul Foley who subsequently became speaker of the House of Commons. It was during this period that he received tempting offers to conform but always turned them down.<br>
<br>In the 1680s Oldfield was for a short time chaplain to Lady Susan Lort in Pembrokeshire, and gained experience in the ministry in both Dublin and at Fetter Lane, London. He became the first minister of a presbyterian congregation at Tooting, Surrey, in 1686 and was ordained at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 18 March 1687. Early in 1691 he became minister of the congregation at Oxford, where he renewed his friendship with Edmund Calamy, whom he had met at Tooting. Calamy says of Oldfield at Oxford that &#145;he was in his prime &hellip; With him I daily conversed &hellip; [and] fell into the utmost freedom with him, and have reason to be thankful for it&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.224). He adds that Oldfield took great pains with his work although he had little encouragement. He was shy and not free in conversations with university students and his small congregation, but his profile increased in the city following the part he played in a public discussion on infant baptism.<br>
<br>In 1694 Oldfield became copastor with William Tong of the presbyterian meeting at Coventry. There he quickly formed an academy for training students for the ministry with the assistance of Tong. This brought him into wider prominence, with the result that in October 1697 he was arraigned before the ecclesiastical court for teaching young men without a licence from the bishop. He resisted the action which was then moved to Lichfield, where the cause was listed as teaching with no licence, not subscribing to the whole <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and all the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and contrary to the 77th canon. Oldfield demanded a hearing in the public courts before the king's bench in London, where in due course the action was dropped, &#145;Not without intimation from his Majesty (upon his having the state of the case laid before him) that he was not pleased with such Prosecutions&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 1.553).<br>
<br>Oldfield left Coventry in 1699 to succeed Thomas Kentish as minister at Globe Alley meeting, Maid Lane, Southwark, a post previously held by his brother Nathaniel (his other brothers John and Samuel were also ministers). He took his academy with him, and carried it forward first in Southwark and later at Hoxton Square, London. The teaching he provided at Hoxton in association with William Lorimer, John Spademan, and later Jean Cappel was recognized as among the best available to dissenters at the time. &#145;He allowed his pupils the greatest freedom of access and conversation, and yet kept up a just authority and esteem among them&#146;  (Harris, 40).<br>
<br>It was in the early years of the eighteenth century that Oldfield became more widely known, and established contacts with both John Locke and Isaac Newton:<blockquote>He was naturally very thoughtful and of great penetration. Sometimes he forgot to eat and was unaffected by noise around him. He was not always so happy in expression, and conveying his sense to others &hellip; He was a man of staid passion, and great meekness and calmness of temper &hellip; He was of no party, but that of God against the Devil and of all serious Christians; and had great charity and moderation to those who differed from him. (Harris, 39)</blockquote>Oldfield was considered as a minister who avoided extremes in religious controversy, but who was at the same time a strong supporter of civil and religious liberty. The University of Edinburgh recognized his learning and position among the dissenters by awarding him a DD in 1709.<br>
<br>Oldfield's published output was meagre for a man of his abilities, and consisted mainly of sermons and a work on the Trinity published in 1721. His congregation dwindled until it was revived with the appointment of Obediah Hughes as his copastor from 1721. Oldfield is mainly known for being the chairman of the Salters' Hall debates on subscription to the Westminster confession in 1719, perhaps the defining event for dissenters in the first half of the eighteenth century. His eirenical approach to religious matters meant that he was probably the best man for this difficult task although he could not prevent the split taking place between those who insisted on subscription to a Trinitarian creed and those who took their stand on the sufficiency of scripture. While orthodox in theology he voted for the non-subscribers probably on the basis that the need to affirm religious liberty and freedom was paramount. Some saw him as partly responsible for the split, as a decision he made as chairman of the conference was its immediate cause.<br>
<br>Oldfield was one of the first trustees of the various foundations made under the will of his close associate Dr Daniel Williams, and in 1723 he was appointed one of the original distributors of government money under the English <i>regium donum</i> to poor ministers and their widows. He may have been the presbyterian minister who married Catherine Massey at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, on 29 July 1707; there is no record of any children. He died at his home in Redcross Street, Southwark, on 8 November 1729 while still the minister at Southwark, and was buried in the same month in Bunhill Fields burial-ground.<br>
