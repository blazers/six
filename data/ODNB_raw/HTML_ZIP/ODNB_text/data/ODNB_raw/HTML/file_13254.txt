<span class="headword">Hilary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1110&#150;1169), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was probably of low birth, since he is baldly described by the chronicle of Battle Abbey as &#145;a certain man called Hilary&#146;. The date of his birth is unknown, but it is likely to have been about 1110. He may have come from the diocese of Salisbury, for he had a brother who was a canon of that cathedral, while his closest connections with any of his episcopal contemporaries were those with Jocelin de Bohun, bishop of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1184). If this were so, it might provide the explanation for how he came by such a rare name for twelfth-century England: about 1100 the Salisbury Cathedral Library was acquiring (as Teresa Webber showed) an exceptional holding of the works of St Hilary of Poitiers. He could have received his early schooling from a Salisbury canon or priest. The Hilary recorded by the <span class="italic">Cartae baronum</span> of 1166 as holding a virgate less than half a knight's fee of Bishop Jocelin, is likely to have been a relative of Bishop Hilary, given the rarity of the name and the practice of naming after an illustrious kinsman.<br>
<br>Like Jocelin de Bohun, Hilary rose to prominence as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Henry de Blois (<i>d</i>. 1171), bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. By about 1140 he held the deanery of the college of secular canons at Christchurch, Twynham, Hampshire, and before he became a bishop he had made a name for himself as an advocate at the papal curia, at just the time that St Bernard of Clairvaux was complaining to Pope Eugenius III about the rising tide of lawsuits being drawn into Rome under the burgeoning system of canon law. Certainly Hilary's character and mind were such as would be associated with a clever lawyer. David Knowles described him as &#145;an extremely quick-witted, efficient, self-confident, voluble, somewhat shallow man, fully acquainted with the new canon law but not prepared to abide by principles to the end. His talents were great but he used them as an opportunist&#146;  (Knowles, 27). In his early years as a bishop he was much employed by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1161) as a legal assessor in cases which the archbishop heard as papal judge-delegate or as metropolitan.<br>
<br>The evidence of Hilary's career as bishop suggests the need to question Knowles's view that he was not guided by principles and was a mere opportunist. In 1147 he was Stephen's candidate for the see of York, following the deposition of William Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1154), and though the pope chose to appoint the Cistercian Henry Murdac (<i>d</i>. 1153), he shortly afterwards advanced Hilary to Chichester, vacant since 1145. But despite the circumstances of his promotion, Hilary appears consistently in politics as a king's man, often in circumstances when his actions cannot be construed as response to pressure. He is the perfect example of how canonical expertise did not at all seem to preclude political royalism or Erastianism, almost as a principle. He was an emissary of King Stephen to the Council of Rheims in 1148, where he excused the king's attempt to prevent Archbishop Theobald's attendance, which elicited from Eugenius the response, &#145;we thought to have turned you into a son of the Roman Church, but we have created in you a sword and an arrow&#146;  (Mayr-Harting, &#145;Hilary&#146;, 212). Stephen subsequently granted Hilary the chapelry of Pevensey, Sussex, and made him queen's chaplain, so that &#145;he might be invited to her feasts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. RAN</span>, 3.184).<br>
<br>Hilary must early have insinuated himself into the good graces of Henry of Anjou, who in his first year as Henry II appointed him to be sheriff of Sussex, a rare case of a bishop in this position (he held it again in 1160&#150;62). He was with the king at the siege of Bridgnorth in Shropshire in 1155, where Hugh (I) de Mortimer was in rebellion; and in 1156 he visited certain shires as a royal itinerant justice. Thus he was heavily involved in Henry II's early peace initiatives after the anarchy of Stephen's reign. To give his rule sacral mystique Henry II lent weight to the efforts of Westminster Abbey to secure the canonization of Edward the Confessor; Hilary wrote one of the letters sent to Pope Alexander III pleading for the canonization, and he was a party to its announcement in Westminster Abbey in 1161. Consequently Hilary's enmity towards Becket in the archbishop's conflict with Henry II may be seen less in the light of a canonist compromising, than of a royalist consistently pursuing, his principles. On the unimpeachable testimony of William fitz Stephen, Hilary remarked at the Council of Northampton (1164) that he wished the archbishop would become plain Thomas again, adding bluntly with reference to Becket's period as king's chancellor, &#145;those who disliked you then, side with the king against you now&#146;  (J. C. Robertson and J. B. Sheppard, <span class="italic">Materials for the History of Thomas Becket</span>, 7 vols., Rolls Series, 1875&#150;85, 3.55). As often in these fraught times, issues of principles and personalities cannot easily be disentangled, and the personality clash between Hilary and Becket clearly went back some years. It probably dated from the Council of Colchester (1157) when Hilary argued&#151;and lost&#151;his suit before the king that Battle Abbey ought to be subject to the bishop of Chichester's jurisdiction. He was on losing ground, because Battle claimed exemption as a royal foundation; but royalism did not mean that a bishop would fail to champion his own rights as a diocesan. It was a basic instinct of every bishop of that time to seek to protect the privileges of his see. Thus it was not against his royalism that Hilary should have opposed the king at Colchester, and his opposition was quickly pardoned. But on that occasion Becket as chancellor had gratuitously embarrassed Hilary by implying publicly that he was a hypocrite. This action was apparently not forgiven.<br>
<br>As with others of his episcopal contemporaries, Hilary is shown by his charters, albeit with rather sparse evidence, to have been a businesslike administrator and pastor. Early in his episcopate, in 1148, he obtained the restitution of lands belonging to the church of Chichester from a certain William Burdard, from William d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel, and from John, count of Eu. Some of these alienations may have reflected the disturbed conditions of Stephen's reign, but the problem with Bexhill and the counts of Eu went back some sixty years. As diocesan he also set an early example in trying to create vicarages, that is, to ensure that a portion of the revenues of parish churches should be set aside for the priests who would reside and do the pastoral work. There is a particularly remarkable document of Hilary's which appears to insist on this point in the case of all the parish churches belonging to Lewes Priory in Sussex. Another fragment of evidence gives a momentary glimpse of Hilary as a patron of learning, making a donation to his cathedral library of one of the earliest manuscripts in England of Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, a crucial work of Parisian theology.<br>
<br>Although Hilary shows himself mainly in the roles of lawyer, politician, and administrator, he can be seen as in tune with an important religious movement of his time in transforming colleges of secular canons into houses of monks or Augustinian canons, the latter being communities of pastors with a quasi-monastic way of life. He assisted in such transformations at his old college of Twynham and at St Nicholas, Arundel; and he vigorously pursued the material interests of the Augustinian canons of Lanthony, Gloucestershire, far away from his own diocese, after the death in 1148 of their great patron, Bishop Robert de Bethune of Hereford. He wrote a pleasant letter to the canons, brisk but friendly, telling them not to get excited about such things. He and other friends of the deceased bishop would look after their affairs as if these were their own; but &#145;you should always be intent on carrying out the divine service as you are bound&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acta</span>, 100). Hilary himself died on 13 July 1169.<br>
