<span class="headword">Hereward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Hereward the Wake]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1070&#150;1071), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, is a figure on whom there is little reliable, and much suspect, information. It has been suggested that his epithet, the Wake, signifies &#145;the wakeful one&#146;. It is, in fact, late, first appearing in the mid-thirteenth-century chronicle of John of Peterborough without gloss, and is more likely to be derived from Hereward's supposed relationship with the manor of Bourne in Lincolnshire, which from the mid-twelfth century was held by the Wake family.<br>
<br>Contemporary or near-contemporary sources for Hereward's life with some claim to unimpeachable authority are confined to the D version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> and to <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. They are sufficient to demonstrate his existence and a celebrated role in the English resistance to Norman rule in and around the Isle of Ely in 1070&#150;71, but little more. The more detailed accounts of his life are all later and of equivocal value. An early twelfth-century interpolation into the E version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, a closely related passage in Hugh Candidus's history of Peterborough Abbey dating from the mid-twelfth century, and the twelfth-century <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, expand on Hereward's resistance and clearly encapsulate the traditions of the two foundations of Peterborough and Ely at the time. But neither is uninfluenced by a contemporary chanson cycle inspired by Hereward's renown. Elements of this cycle survive in Gaimar's <span class="italic">Lestoire des Engles</span> dating from the 1140s, and in the late medieval <span class="italic">Historia Croylandensis</span> from Crowland. It is, however, most fully represented in the early twelfth-century <span class="italic">Gesta Herewardi</span>. An elaboration of the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, this deals with Hereward's birth and early career as well as his resistance to the Normans. It manifestly draws on literary devices and heroic topoi, and, seemingly contradicting the few details afforded by the contemporary sources, it has been almost universally execrated. Nevertheless, it may embody some authentic detail.<br>
<br>It is impossible to determine Hereward's family background with any certainty. The chanson tradition identifies him as the son of a Leofric of Bourne (variously said to be a kinsman of Ralph the Staller, Ralph, earl of Hereford, and Brand, abbot of Peterborough) and of an Eadgyth, the great-great-great-niece of Oslac, earl of Northumberland. None of these assertions can be substantiated. Nevertheless, it seems likely that Hereward was of high social status. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> seemingly reveals that he held only a small estate in Laughton in his own right (there is no reason to believe that the Hereward who held lands in Warwickshire and Worcestershire in 1066 and 1086 was the same man), but he was otherwise a tenant of Peterborough Abbey in Witham on the Hill and Barholme and Stowe, and of Crowland Abbey in Rippingale, all in a small area of Kesteven in southern Lincolnshire. Nevertheless, the annual rent which he paid for Rippingale was a kind of tenure more typical of a political ally than of a subordinate. There are, moreover, indications that Hereward conferred title on Oger the Breton for much of his lands in 1086, and he can therefore probably be identified as a king's thegn. Whether he ever held Bourne is unclear; <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> ascribes the manor to Earl Morcar in 1066, but much of Morcar's estates in south Lincolnshire was apparently forfeitures held by him as earl or by his representative.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16472"></a><span class="headword">Leofric</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1070&#150;1071), <span class="occ">priest</span>, who should not be confused with Hereward's father, is named by the author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Herewardi</span> as Hereward's priest at Bourne and the writer of an Old English life of the rebel which provided much of the information in the first part of the <span class="italic">Gesta</span>; authentic detail there may indicate the existence of such a source or a similar one.<br>
<br>According to the <span class="italic">Gesta Herewardi</span>, Hereward was a quarrelsome child and youth; and at the age of eighteen he was exiled for his unruliness at the petition of his exasperated father. He is then said to have wandered in Northumberland, Cornwall, Ireland, and Flanders. On his return to England, Hereward found that his brother had been murdered and his patrimony seized by Normans. Revenge quickly ensued, and he gathered around him a small band of discontented Englishmen. He was knighted &#145;in the English manner&#146; by Abbot Brand of Peterborough; and he then encountered and slew a certain Frederick, before returning to Flanders. After a further adventure there he returned to England for good. Much of this must be romance, although an account of an expedition into &#145;Scaldimariland&#146; (that is, Zeeland) by Manasses (I), count of Gu&icirc;nes, can be placed in a contemporary historical context; and Hereward's murder of Frederick, who can be identified as the brother of Gundrada, wife of William (I) de Warenne, is, in a seemingly independent source, substantiated by the Hyde chronicle.<br>
<br>Hereward comes into focus as a historical figure with the siege of the Isle of Ely as recorded in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. In the spring of 1070, a Danish fleet arrived in the Humber and roused the country to revolt against the Normans. At the same time the abbey of Peterborough was plundered &#145;by the men that Bishop &AElig;thelric had excommunicated because there they had taken all that he had&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1071, text D). In the following year earls Eadwine and Morcar rebelled against Norman rule and retreated into the fenland with various discontented Englishmen. In reply King William dispatched a fleet and land force and besieged the Isle of Ely. The rebels were forced to submit &#145;except Hereward alone and those who could escape with him and he led them out valiantly&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1072, text D).<br>
<br>The later sources are more fulsome, but there is no reason to doubt the essential veracity of the account they give. All are in agreement that Hereward led the assault on Peterborough Abbey as the leader of the abbey's tenants who resented the appointment of the Norman Turold to the house. Hereward at this time seems to have been in alliance with the Danes, and Peterborough tradition saw the action as one motivated by pure greed. There is, however, perhaps some truth in Hereward's concern, reported by Hugh Candidus, for the well-being of the foundation; as a prominent tenant of the abbey he may well have considered that he was acting in its best interests. Nevertheless, much of the treasure of the abbey was taken by the Danes after Hereward retreated to Ely.<br>
<br>There is no information on Hereward's activities in the next few months, but after Eadwine and Morcar's resort to the Isle, he is portrayed as a principal actor in the opposition to the besiegers by the author of the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> in an account that apparently draws on local knowledge. The monks of Ely are said to have feared that their abbot, Thurstan, was to be replaced by a foreign cleric and called upon Hereward to defend them. However, given the high status of the rebels, it seems unlikely that Hereward was the actual leader. His valiant escape, though, must suggest that he was a daring soldier who impressed the rebels with his courage and ingenuity.<br>
<br>There is no contemporary evidence for Hereward's fate after his escape from the Isle of Ely. The later sources all agree that he was reconciled with William the Conqueror and regained his patrimony. Gaimar asserts that he was subsequently killed by a band of Englishmen, but the <span class="italic">Gesta Herewardi</span> and the <span class="italic">Historia Croylandensis</span> imply that he died in his bed. He is said to have been buried at Crowland. According to the <span class="italic">Historia</span>, he was succeeded in his estates by a daughter. Hereward had married an aristocratic Flemish woman called Turfrida before his return to England (Gaimar alone reports a second marriage&#151;to Alftruda). Their daughter is not named, but she is said to have married Hugh d'Evermue, and they in their turn were succeeded by a daughter who married Richard de Rullos. This descent is not wholly consistent with the known history of the barony of Bourne which incorporated Hereward's lands. However, title thereto continued to inform a dispute between the lords of Bourne and Peterborough Abbey into the mid-twelfth century, and it might therefore be suspected that the story contains a germ of truth.<br>
<br>The legend of Hereward developed at an early period. The laconic reference to him in the D version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> suggests that within a few years of the event his daring escape was so famous that it required no further explanation. More clearly, the E version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> and Hugh Candidus's history drew on an English source written before 1121, and one of the three sources employed in the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> appears to have been written in English. The audience was probably always local in the middle ages, but by the early twelfth century it was not exclusively English; Gaimar's history was written for an Anglo-Norman audience that could celebrate its English antecedents. The legend remained alive and probably vital into the later middle ages, as attested by the <span class="italic">Historia Croylandensis</span>, and as late as 1407 a genealogy was drawn up tracing the supposed descent of Edmund Holland, earl of Kent, from Hereward. Hereward owes his current popularity as an archetypal English hero in the mould of Robin Hood to the publication of the <span class="italic">Gesta Herewardi</span> in the nineteenth century and to Charles Kingsley's novel <span class="italic">Hereward the Wake</span> (1866) which is largely based upon it.<br>
