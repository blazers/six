<span class="headword">Shepherd <span class="st"> [Sheppard]</span>,  Nicholas</span>  (1533&#150;1587), <span class="occ">college head</span>, matriculated as a sizar from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1549, and was admitted a scholar there on the foundation of Sir Marmaduke Constable on 4 July, his native county being given as Westmorland. He was admitted at the command of the royal visitors. He graduated BA in 1553 and was elected a fellow on the foundation of William Fell on 25 March, but was ejected in 1554. Shepherd graduated MA in 1559, and was reinstated as a fellow in 1559&#150;60. On 15 January 1561 he was elected a senior fellow. He served as junior bursar of the college in 1561&#150;2, and on 4 July 1562 was elected a fellow of Trinity College. At Trinity Shepherd held office as junior dean (1562&#150;3), senior bursar (1562&#150;4), and vice-master (1564&#150;9). He was university preacher in 1561 and 1566, and graduated BTh in 1568.<br>
<br>On 17 December 1569 Shepherd was elected master of St John's, &#145;with the great consent of the company&#146;  (Scott 1910, 299) according to Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, who wrote to William Cecil recommending Shepherd to his patronage. Grindal expressed the hope that he would restore the college to the &#145;antient fame it had in your days and mine&#146;. This hope was to some extent vindicated by the election as fellows of the Hebraist Hugh Broughton, the Greek scholar Andrew Downes, Everard Digby, and others, for whose advancement Thomas Baker unequivocally gives Shepherd credit. Broughton himself states that Shepherd personally enforced his election in 1570, and tried to deter him from migrating to Christ's by persuading the seniors to join him in doubling the value of Broughton's fellowship out of their own allowances. According to Broughton, Shepherd, having failed, &#145;was sick for grief, as many did report&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 360&#150;61). Perhaps in complement to Broughton's work, a great Syriac <span class="roman">Testament</span> was bought by agreement of the master and seniors in 1570.<br>
<br>During September 1573 when the bishop of Ely carried out a visitation of St John's, some fellows indicted Shepherd on charges of peculation, insufficient residence, and opposition to the established church by fostering a puritan faction within the college. Shepherd responded to the charges, appealing to his patron Cecil, but in July the following year he vacated the mastership. His conduct, however well meaning, had been at times high-handed, as in the case of Broughton. He had been a prebendary of Peterborough since 1560 and of Lincoln since 1572, and retained these posts and the Lincolnshire rectory of Hougham until his death there between 10 and 16 July 1587, when he was buried at Hougham. His will mentions a wife, Rachel, as well as his mother, now named Anne Todd.<br>
