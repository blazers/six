<span class="headword">Frith,  Francis</span>  (1822&#150;1898), <span class="occ">photographer and businessman</span>, was born on 7 October 1822 in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the only son and the second among the three children of Francis Frith (1790&#150;1871), cooper of Chesterfield, and his wife, Alice (1789?&#150;1863). Born into a Quaker family, Frith's childhood combined firm morality with the indulgence given to an only son. His wanderings in the nearby Derbyshire dales laid the foundations for his lifelong love of landscape. Between 1834 and 1838 he attended Camp Hill School, a Quaker establishment in Birmingham. He was a mediocre scholar but loved poetry, science, and travel books. After he had left he was apprenticed to William Hargreaves, of a cutlery firm in Sheffield. The internal conflicts caused by his strong Quaker beliefs and lack of prospects caused a breakdown when he was twenty-one. For two years he travelled through Britain convalescing. In 1845 he started a wholesale grocery business in Liverpool, and later a printing business; hard work and a good business sense allowed him to sell these for a small fortune in 1856.<br>
<br>In 1853 Frith had been a founder-member of the Liverpool Photographic Society. Fascinated by photography (he also drew and painted), he embarked on the three journeys to the Middle East that were to make his reputation. Between 1856 and 1859 he travelled to Palestine and Syria and up the Nile, where he took pioneering photographs of the landscape and of monuments, often under dangerous and difficult conditions. He slept in tombs and caves and was attacked by wild dogs and brigands; inside an unventilated tent he worked in desert temperatures with collodion chemicals that were prone to boil on the glass-plate negatives. Back in London his work was praised by the Photographic Society and in <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He lectured and exhibited, and published his photographs in a series of successful books.<br>
<br>In 1860 Frith set up a photographic company in Reigate, Surrey (where he settled), to record on film as many locations in Britain as he could. The arrival of the railways had made cheap holidays widely available, and Frith's prints made popular souvenirs, both in postcard and folio format. For a time Frith &amp; Co. was the largest photographic publisher in the world. Frith travelled widely and took thousands of the photographs himself, as well as commissioning many fine photographers, including Francis Bedford. The care taken in the execution and subsequent preservation of these photographs, and the wealth of period detail that they record, has made them an invaluable resource for historians.<br>
<br>Success allowed Frith to devote more time to leisure and to his family. On 19 July 1860 he had married Mary Ann (1837&#150;1901), daughter of Alfred Rosling of Reigate, a timber importer; they had five sons and three daughters. Frith remained a convinced Quaker all his life and contributed a number of articles to the <span class="italic">Friends Quarterly Examiner</span>. Perhaps his most influential publication was <span class="italic">A Reasonable Faith: Short Religious Essays for the Times</span> (1844), a work of liberal theology that he co-authored with William Pollard and William E. Turner. For the last twenty years of his life bronchitis made him take holidays on the French riviera; he said of these later years that he &#145;fell back upon books and art, nature, love and poetry&#146;. He died on 25 February 1898 at his home&#151;La Petite Bastide&#151;in Cannes, France, where he was buried. After his death his sons Eustace and Cyril continued the business, which carried on trading until 1971.<br>
<br>Francis Frith's achievement was two-fold: his photographs of the Middle East set new standards in technical excellence, and his business acumen brought landscape photography to the man in the street. The Frith &amp; Co. archive, now held at Teffont, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, remains one of the most important collections of topographical photographs of Britain in existence, and its contents have been extensively republished in book form.<br>
