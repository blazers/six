<span class="headword">Ogilvie,  John</span> <span class="st"> [St John Ogilvie]</span>  (1578/9&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, the eldest son of Walter Ogilvie of Drum (and later perhaps of Milton), was born in Strathisla, Banffshire. Brought up a Calvinist, he matriculated in August 1592 at the protestant University of Helmstedt in northern Germany. In 1596, having become a Catholic, he entered the Scots College of Douai, at that time at Louvain. In June 1598 he was sent to the Scottish Benedictine abbey at Regensburg but by the end of the year was a student at the Jesuit college in Olomouc.<br>
<br>In November 1599, aged twenty, he entered the noviciate of the Jesuit Austrian-Bohemian province at Brno and two years later, on 26 December 1601, made his vows. The next nine years were spent in study and work in various places in the province. After three years of philosophy at Graz he taught for two years or more at Vienna. There followed an additional year of apologetics to prepare him for controversy, then for two years he studied theology at Olomouc, during which time he was in charge of a students' sodality, that is, a devotional confraternity. In August 1610 he was sent by the Jesuit-general to Paris, where he was ordained priest, and went on to Rouen to teach for three years.<br>
<br>At that time the general wished to resume missionary work in Scotland, though it was a particularly difficult and dangerous time for Catholicism, with John Spottiswood, archbishop of Glasgow, energetically supporting the Erastianism of James VI and I. Ogilvie volunteered and finally in 1613 received orders to go to Scotland. He landed at Leith in November 1613, in the guise of John Watson, horse dealer. We know very little of his movements, except that he went up to the north-east for a time, then returned south to Edinburgh. There followed a mysterious episode. About the end of February 1614 he went to London and was for a time at the royal court. Towards the end of March he travelled to Paris. His superior, James Gordon, was displeased and sent him back with orders not to return without permission, but the general was more sympathetic and commended his zeal. Though the purpose of his journey to France is not known it is most significant that he travelled from London to France and back with a safe conduct. The king surely knew Ogilvie and the plan he had in mind.<br>
<br>Back in Scotland in June, Ogilvie resumed his work of administering the sacraments to Catholics, reconciling those who had lapsed, and making new converts. He was active in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Renfrewshire. It was secret and dangerous work, for at any time he could be betrayed, which is what happened. On 4 October 1614 he was captured while walking in a Glasgow street. Two narratives of his imprisonment were printed: the authorities' <span class="italic">True Relation</span>, their account of his examinations and execution, and his own description of his sufferings and his dealings with various interrogators. The latter, written in Latin, was continued by his Scottish associates and later published as <span class="italic">Relatio incarcerationis</span>. Further details were added by the later testimonies of his associates. Despite their very different purpose and slant the accounts agree on the main events.<br>
<br>On 5 October, the day after his capture, Ogilvie was examined by a group headed by Spottiswood, and their report was sent to the king. Ogilvie refused to answer on oath anything that would incriminate himself or others or would imply acceptance of the king's authority to put questions on spiritual matters. After two months' confinement in Glasgow he was taken to Edinburgh and on 12 December was examined before five lords commissioners appointed by the king. Again he refused to divulge where or with whom he had stayed, and for the same reasons. So, as the king had given leave for him to be tortured, he was kept awake for (according to his own narrative) eight days and nine nights until he was not far from death. How much he divulged in this condition is not clear. After only one day's respite the examination was resumed, then he was taken back to Glasgow by Spottiswood, arriving on Christmas eve.<br>
<br>Ogilvie's narrative was apparently written during this second period in Glasgow. It is a fresh and lively account though also diffuse and circumstantial, with details of ill treatment as well as of questioning on matters of religion, to which he replied with spirit. Not surprisingly it has many difficulties and ambiguities but clearly the treatment he received was inconsistent, perhaps deliberately so. At times his feet were bound to a massive iron bar, yet with Spottiswood he visited a neighbour's gardens and house. Spottiswood spoke to him in public in friendly fashion, yet increased the rigours of his imprisonment. He was denied pen and paper, yet he was able to write letters and his lengthy narrative.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1615 he was formally questioned on five points concerning the king's power and the pope's jurisdiction. These were drawn up by the king, and the five men conducting the inquiry were appointed by the king. In fact, apart from the initial investigation immediately after Ogilvie's capture, the legal proceedings did not follow the ordinary course of law but were put in place by the king personally. James had been controverting on these matters with Jesuit theologians and during the examination works by Bellarmine and Suarez lay on the table. The five questions did not concern the king's authority alone but whether the pope's authority was superior.<br>
<br>To the first two questions Ogilvie answered clearly that the pope could judge the king, had power over him in spiritual matters, and could excommunicate him. The next three questions were whether the pope could depose the king, whether it was lawful to kill the king so deposed, and whether the pope could release subjects from their allegiance to the king. To each of these Ogilvie refused to reply, as the king had no authority to judge such matters. At his first examination, however, Ogilvie had declared that he detested the assassination of kings and had condemned the Gunpowder Plot.<br>
<br>Ogilvie's final trial was fixed for 28 February. He was told beforehand (and at the trial itself this was stated explicitly) that he was not accused of saying mass or converting anyone to Catholicism or for matters of conscience, but for declining the king's authority. The proceedings were formal, with four judges, assisted by a group of notables headed by Spottiswood, and a jury of fifteen men of some standing. Ogilvie refused to change his previous answers, and was found guilty and condemned to be hanged. Three hours later he was taken to a gallows erected nearby and executed. There are various accounts of incidents on the scaffold which must have given much publicity to the Jesuit's fate. He was buried that day outside the city.<br>
<br>A number of those who had sheltered Ogilvie were condemned to death but the sentences were commuted to exile. Indeed Ogilvie was the only Catholic in Scotland ever to be judicially sentenced and executed for his religion. Even James Moffat, a Scots Jesuit who was captured one month after Ogilvie, was tried by ordinary process of law and exiled, as was Patrick Anderson only six years later, though they shared Ogilvie's views on papal and royal authority. The strong suspicion remains that there was something personal between Ogilvie and the king. Ogilvie at his final trial declared that he and Father William Crichton, a Scots Jesuit who had consistently supported James's succession to the English throne, had done more for James abroad than any of his accusers. He was surely referring to his mission to France in the spring of 1614. James knew him and knew his purpose.<br>
<br>Ogilvie's posthumous renown spread quickly on the continent. The <span class="italic">Relatio incarcerationis</span> was published in eight places and he featured increasingly in the printed literature of Europe. Initial steps for his beatification were taken by an examination in 1628 at W&uuml;rzburg of two of his associates in Glasgow, both of them now monks in the Scots monastery there, and in 1629 at Rome of an Edinburgh associate. Nothing more was done until in the nineteenth century the publication of Scottish historical sources led to his rediscovery and so to the production of Catholic devotional literature featuring him. In December 1929 he was beatified and in October 1976 formally canonized.<br>
