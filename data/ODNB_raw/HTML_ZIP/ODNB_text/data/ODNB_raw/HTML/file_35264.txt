</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Novello,  Ivor</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>David Ivor Davies]</span>  (1893&#150;1951), <span class="occ">composer, actor, and playwright</span>, was born on 15 January 1893 at Llywn yr Eos (Nightingales' Grove), 95 Cowbridge Road, Cardiff, the only son of David Davies (1852?&#150;1931), a rent collector for Cardiff council, and his wife, Clara Novello Davies (1861&#150;1943), a singing teacher and choral conductor. His parents had married on 31 October 1883 at Salem Chapel in Cardiff, and the independently minded Clara had increasingly developed a reputation as a singing teacher and choral conductor. Six months after Ivor's birth she took her Welsh Ladies' Choir to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago; they won first prize in the women's choral competition and then embarked on a tour of America. Following a royal command performance at Osborne for Queen Victoria, the choir was given the royal appellation. It subsequently toured further, and in 1899 won prizes at the Paris Exhibition. Clara established a teaching practice in London at 13 George Street, Hanover Square, and also taught at her London home (143 Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale), where Ivor became acquainted with leading performers of the day, including members of George Edwardes's Gaiety Girls and such friends of his mother as Dame Clara Butt, Adelina Patti, and Landon Ronald. After private education in Cardiff and Gloucester, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with the cathedral organist, Dr Herbert Brewer, he gained a scholarship to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where for three of his five years he was a solo treble in Magdalen College choir. He later attributed his fondness for the composers of the Romantic era, particularly Wagner, to a reaction against this exposure as a boy to early sacred choral music.<h2>
<a name="Earlysongwriting"></a>Early songwriting</h2>Visits to the Gaiety and Daly's theatres in London led the young man towards early vocal compositions: his waltz &#145;Spring of the Year&#146; was featured on a programme given by his mother's choir at the Albert Hall, but it was only with &#145;The Little Damozel&#146; (1910) that he attracted any attention. He spent some time in Cardiff teaching the piano, but moved permanently to London in 1913 and took a flat at 11 Aldwych, which became his London residence for the rest of his life. There he fell under the patronage of Sir Edward Marsh, who encouraged his composition and also facilitated his career through practical introductions. Davies began to use the name Ivor Novello professionally and formally changed his name by deed poll in 1927.<br>
<br>Novello did not escape entirely from the First World War: in 1914 he achieved one of his greatest songwriting successes with &#145;Till the boys come home&#146; (&#145;Keep the home fires burning&#146;), to words by the American poet, Lena Guilbert Ford. It was not until June 1916 that he reported to Crystal Palace training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant, but after crashing twice, and through the influence of Marsh, he was moved to the Air Ministry office in the Hotel Cecil. He continued his musical theatre writing and had his first major success with <span class="italic">Theodore &amp; Co.</span> (Gaiety Theatre, 14 September 1916), a production by George Grossmith and Edward Laurillard that had a score written jointly by Novello and Jerome Kern. Novello then contributed to Andr&eacute; Charlot's revue <span class="italic">See-Saw</span> (14 December 1916) and another production by Grossmith and Laurillard, the musical comedy <span class="italic">Arlette</span> (6 September 1917). In 1917 he was introduced through Marsh to the actor Robert (Bobbie) Andrews (1895&#150;1976), and the two became lovers and lifelong companions. Further shows raised Novello's profile even further, with the musical comedies <span class="italic">Who's Hooper?</span> by Fred Thompson (13 September 1919; a joint score with Howard Talbot) and <span class="italic">The Golden Moth</span> by Thompson and P. G. Wodehouse (5 October 1921), and with his continuing association with Charlot through the revues <span class="italic">Tabs</span> (15 May 1918), <span class="italic">A to Z</span> (21 October 1921; including &#145;And her mother came too&#146;, with the lyricist Dion Titheradge), and <span class="italic">Puppets</span> (2 January 1924).<h2>
<a name="Silentfilmstar"></a>Silent film star</h2>Despite his inexperience, Novello was offered a silent-film role in <span class="italic">The Call of the Blood</span> (1920) by the French film director Louis Mercanton, who employed him as a romantic lead on the strength of a publicity photograph. Through this, over the next decade Novello embarked on a successful film career and was also prompted to develop his stage ability. His next film, <span class="italic">Miarka</span> (1920) was also for Mercanton, and in 1921 he appeared on stage in an amateur performance of E. G. E. Bulwer Lytton's 1850 play <span class="italic">Not as Bad as We Seem</span>. He made his professional stage d&eacute;but in a straight play as a Young Man in <span class="italic">Deburau</span> (Ambassadors Theatre, 1921), in which the role of Charles Deburau was played by Bobbie Andrews. Novello made his first English film, <span class="italic">Carnival</span>, in 1921, and his first film in America, <span class="italic">The White Rose</span> (1923), for D. W. Griffiths. Clara Novello Davies had also enjoyed a continuing reputation, and after the First World War she built up a teaching practice in New York, where her pupils included many of the singers from the shows of Florenz Ziegfeld and Charles Dillingham, among them Dorothy Dixon (at that time a dancer rather than a singer) and the leading soprano Mary Ellis, both of whom were later to star in Novello's London musical romances.<br>
<br>Novello's increasing prominence as a silent film star did not prevent his development of stage material, and in 1924 he produced and starred in the successful play <span class="italic">The Rat</span> (Prince of Wales's Theatre, 9 June 1924). Credited to the pseudonymous David L'Estrange, it was written by Novello with his friend the actress Constance Collier. Most importantly, the film of <span class="italic">The Rat</span> (1925) was a major success and led to a sequel, <span class="italic">The Triumph of the Rat</span>, in 1926; a further sequel, <span class="italic">Return of the Rat</span>, was produced in 1928. Novello starred in further films, notably in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">The Lodger</span> (1926), which Hitchcock credited as being the first film in his own style. A contract with the Gainsborough Film Company in 1927 led to his making <span class="italic">The Constant Nymph</span> in the Austrian Tyrol in the autumn of that year and in addition enabled him to purchase Munro Lodge, Littlewick Green, near Maidenhead. He renamed the property Redroofs, and it remained his main residence outside London for the rest of his life. In 1928 he appeared in the silent adaptation of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">The Vortex</span> and made his last silent film, <span class="italic">A South Sea Bubble</span>.<br>
<br>Novello returned to the musical stage with the revue <span class="italic">The House that Jack Built</span> (Adelphi Theatre, 8 November 1929), to which he contributed eight items to a score that also included music by Vivian Ellis, Arthur Schwartz, and Sydney Baynes. Although Novello had retained some musical theatre compositional presence with a few song contributions to shows, since <span class="italic">Puppets</span> he had been involved primarily with the straight theatre, acting in Ferenc Molnar's <span class="italic">Liliom</span> (Duke of York's Theatre, 23 December 1926) and No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Sirocco</span> (Daly's, 24 November 1927) and producing his own play <span class="italic">Symphony in Two Flats</span> (New Theatre, 14 October 1929). In 1930 he went to New York for a short run of <span class="italic">Symphony in Two Flats</span> (Shubert Theater, 16 September 1930) and then a more successful production of his <span class="italic">The Truth Game</span> (Ethel Barrymore Theater, 27 December 1930), which brought him to the attention of Hollywood studios. With a contract from MGM as both a screen writer and an actor, he arrived in Hollywood in the summer of 1931 and initially began working on a screen adaptation of <span class="italic">The Truth Game</span>. His abilities were hardly utilized by the large studio system and he made only one minor film as an actor; the period has been better remembered for his work on the script for <span class="italic">Tarzan the Ape Man</span>, for which he reputedly originated the line that gave rise to the now mythical if inaccurate &#145;Me Tarzan. You Jane&#146; (originally&#151;with appropriate pointing&#151;&#145;Tarzan. Jane.&#146;). His father died in October 1931 while Novello was in Hollywood, and&#151;tired of his relatively insignificant role in the studio system&#151;he returned to London.<h2>
<a name="Majormusicals"></a>Major musicals</h2>The 1930s for Novello were characterized by prolific work as an actor and playwright and by the beginning of a series of musical theatre works for which he is best remembered. He had written the play <span class="italic">I Lived With You</span> while in Hollywood, and it was produced in the West End at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in the spring of 1932. The following year saw great success, with simultaneous London productions of <span class="italic">Fresh Fields</span> (Criterion), <span class="italic">Proscenium</span> (Globe), and <span class="italic">Sunshine Sisters</span> (Queen's). Also in 1933 his <span class="italic">Flies in the Sun</span> employed Christopher Hassall (introduced to Novello by Marsh) as an understudy for a tour, and who was also to appear in <span class="italic">Murder in Mayfair</span> (5 September 1934). It was with Hassall as lyricist that Novello wrote his first musical romance for Drury Lane, <span class="italic">Glamorous Night</span> (2 May 1935), and its extravagant mix of theatrical effects and a pared-down operetta lyricism ensured its immediate popularity; Hassall was to contribute lyrics to nearly all of Novello's later musical stage shows. Novello played the romantic lead himself&#151;something he continued to do in all but his last musical, <span class="italic">Gay's the Word</span>, in 1950&#151;while his leading lady was Mary Ellis. With its combination of a Ruritanian princess and a television inventor, set pieces that included the sinking of an ocean liner, and a musical style that drew heavily on the operetta tradition of Franz Leh&aacute;r and the Victorian ballad, it was a peculiarly British concoction. Despite its acclaim, <span class="italic">Glamorous Night</span> was closed in order to make way for the traditional Christmas pantomime; however, with the following year's <span class="italic">Careless Rapture</span> (Drury Lane, 11 September 1936) Novello sealed what has become an enduring association both with the theatre and with a style of musical theatre work that was uniquely his own. <span class="italic">Crest of the Wave</span> (Drury Lane, 1 September 1937) continued this style combining large-scale theatrical effects and well-placed lyrical numbers in an otherwise escapist plot. Its duet &#145;Why isn't it you&#146; is a witty ironic revue number that signals Novello's background in revue, while with &#145;Rose of England&#146; he made one of his most eloquent statements of a sincere patriotic feeling.<br>
<br>Clara Novello Davies had remained active in music, despite her supposed retirement in 1926, when she left New York to take up residence in her son's Aldwych flat. In her mid-seventies she was rehearsing her choir for a short tour abroad, and in 1937 she was an official representative of Wales along with her Royal Welsh Ladies' Choir at the Paris Exhibition; at their first concert on 16 October at the Palais du Bois she was presented with the m&eacute;daille de m&eacute;rite by the French government and the gold medal of the Renaissance Fran&ccedil;aise. A somewhat injudicious tour to sing for international peace just before the outbreak of the Second World War&#151;abruptly curtailed&#151;effectively marked the end of a remarkable career, and her attentions were diverted by her son into the writing of her autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life I have Loved</span> (1940). She died peacefully on 1 March 1943.<br>
<br>In 1938 Novello played the title role in a limited engagement of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> at Drury Lane. He received complimentary notices for his performance, but this was only a brief excursion into more heavyweight drama, and in the same year his play <span class="italic">Com&eacute;dienne</span> was produced. Based on the character of Mrs Patrick Campbell, the play is typical in Novello's use of a theatrical world for its setting&#151;a device he employed in other plays, such as <span class="italic">Sunshine Girls</span>, and, with the inclusion of opera singers, in his musical romances. For someone whose life was so completely bound up in the theatre from an early age, surrounded by both performers and writers, it was inevitable that it would provide his primary source of reference and inspiration. <span class="italic">The Dancing Years</span> (Drury Lane, 23 March 1939) has become Novello's most lasting musical stage work, and among its wealth of melodies is his archetypal waltz song &#145;Waltz of my Heart&#146;. Hugely successful, it was driven out of its home at Drury Lane with the onset of the Second World War and so toured the country for several years, finally returning to the West End at the Adelphi on 14 March 1942, to run until 8 July 1944. During this extensive run <span class="italic">Arc de Triomphe</span> (Phoenix, 9 November 1943), another showcase for Mary Ellis, was much less well received.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandfinalyears"></a>Imprisonment and final years</h2>On 24 March 1944, following the improper use of his car during wartime rationing, Novello was charged with unlawful conspiracy to commit offences against the motor vehicles (restriction of use) order 1942. The victim of duplicitous acts by a supposed fan and assistant, Dora Grace Constable, Novello was none the less deemed liable, and on 24 April 1944 at Bow Street court he was sentenced to eight weeks in prison. Constable was fined &pound;50 with &pound;25 costs. An appeal (16 May 1944) reduced the sentence from eight weeks to four, but his brief spell in Wormwood Scrubs, however ameliorated by his fame and the influence of his friends, severely shook him mentally and physically, with lasting effects. After a period of recovery at Redroofs he returned to <span class="italic">The Dancing Years</span> in June 1944 and received a rapturous ovation upon his first entrance.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Perchance to Dream</span> opened at the Hippodrome (21 April 1945) and introduced another of Novello's most enduring numbers, the Victorian parlour ballad pastiche &#145;We'll gather lilacs&#146;. Despite continually playing to full houses, the London production was closed after 1000 performances and the company taken on tour to South Africa. Novello flew to South Africa via a short trip to New York, arriving in the second week of December to open the show at His Majesty's Theatre, Johannesburg, on 23 December 1947. He subsequently appeared at Cape Town for two weeks from 20 February 1948.<br>
<br>Novello's last major musical romance was <span class="italic">King's Rhapsody</span> (Palace, 15 September 1949), which used a plot that mirrored many elements of the abdication crisis. Apart from his own portrayal of Prince Nikki, the romance introduced Vanessa Lee as Princess Christiane; her &#145;Someday my heart will awake&#146; was the last of the characteristic sweeping waltz songs that became a defining feature of Novello's output. On 16 February 1951 his last show, <span class="italic">Gay's the Word</span>, opened at the Saville. A musical comedy that took as its subject the contrasting styles of European operetta and post-war American musicals in the West End, it starred the comedienne Cicely Courtneidge and for the first time had no role for Novello; the lyricist was the young and acerbic Alan Melville, who had his roots in intimate revue, rather than the highly poetic Hassall. Novello was still playing in the hugely successful run of <span class="italic">King's Rhapsody</span> but had increasingly been feeling unwell. A Christmas holiday to his house on Jamaica, Wyndways at Montego Bay, failed to restore his health. He returned to London in February 1951, unwisely insisted on performing, and died of coronary thrombosis at his home at about 2.15 a.m. on 6 March 1951, shortly after completing his evening performance in <span class="italic">King's Rhapsody</span>. The committal was held at Golders Green crematorium at 1 p.m. on 12 March 1951, and his ashes were buried under a lilac tree. A memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 28 May 1951 was relayed outside on loudspeakers to a crowd of several thousands. His will included a substantial bequest to Bobbie Andrews and various legacies to theatrical charities; Redroofs was later sold at auction (the proceeds went to Andrews) and the property became a convalescent home for actors.<br>
<br>Novello was an extraordinary figure, combining high achievement in writing and performing, both on stage and in films; the guest books for his homes are a virtual compendium of the leading stars of the day, and regularly include the names of such figures as Gladys Cooper, Vivien Leigh, Douglas Fairbanks junior, and No&euml;l Coward. The establishment of his matin&eacute;e idol image in the 1920s, drawing on his elegant and strong profile, was a significant factor in retaining his appeal as a stage performer. His writing and performing brought a sense of genuine emotion to otherwise light and artificial material and made a virtue of them. Many of his plays and musical romances contain an acerbic and well-observed barbed wit, which Novello particularly indulged for his company stalwart and unofficial housekeeper, Olive Gilbert, in <span class="italic">Perchance to Dream</span>. High-quality artifice, escapism, and a sense of the exotic were at the heart of his approach to theatre. A scholarship in his memory was established at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and in 1952 a bronze bust of Novello sculpted by Clemence Dane, and previously in the Aldwych flat, was unveiled in the rotunda of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. A commemorative panel was installed in the actors' church of St Paul's, Covent Garden, and in 1972 a memorial stone was unveiled in St Paul's Cathedral to mark the twenty-first anniversary of his death.<br>
