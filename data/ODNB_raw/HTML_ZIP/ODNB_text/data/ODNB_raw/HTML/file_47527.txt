<span class="headword">Gordon,  Henry <span class="st"> [Harry]</span>  Panmure</span>  (1837&#150;1902), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 22 October 1837 at Killiechassie, Perthshire, the son of Henry George Gordon, a director of the Union Bank of London. Baptized Panmure-Gordon, he dropped the hyphen from his name later in life, and was universally known as &#145;P. G.&#146;. He was distantly related to Lord Byron and later bequeathed his collection of Byron memorabilia to Harrow School, where he had been educated before going on to Oxford University and then spending a year in Bonn. In 1856 he was commissioned into the 10th hussars, but resigned his commission in 1860 following the bankruptcy of his father.<br>
<br>Gordon went out to China, where he joined Lindsay &amp; Co. of Shanghai (later part of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.), and served under General Gordon at the time of the Taiping rebellion, raising and commanding the Shanghai mounted ranger volunteers. He returned to London in 1865 and became a member of the stock exchange and a junior partner in J. and A. Scrimgeour &amp; Co., in Old Broad Street. In 1876 he founded his own firm of stockbrokers, Gordon &amp; Co., in Hatton Court, Threadneedle Street. This became Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. a year later. In 1885 it became Panmure Gordon, Hill &amp; Co., and in 1902 it reverted to Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. Gordon married, late in life, Carrie Hall (<i>d</i>. 1913), daughter of Thomas Beverley Hall, of Beverley, in Yorkshire. His wife was some twenty years his junior, and there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. became one of the largest and most active firms of stockbrokers in the City, being particularly well known for underwriting numerous issues of stock by both British and United States breweries, as well as many loans on the part of Far Eastern and South American governments, including China and Japan and several of the states of Brazil. Gordon was awarded the Grand Officer's Star of the royal order of Jakovo in 1898 for arranging a Serbian loan, and the order of the Rising Sun for his services as sole broker to the Japanese government. Other companies for which the firm acted included the Mashonaland Railway Company and Shell Transport and Trading Company. He is said to have pioneered industrial preference shares and when Liptons was floated on the stock exchange in 1898 he was the first to issue shares at a premium.<br>
<br>For many years Gordon lived in Brighton, at 34 Adelaide Crescent, travelling to London every weekday by train. Later he lived at Charles Street and 5 Carlton House Terrace in London, and leased a country house at Loudwater Park, near Rickmansworth. The extravagance of his personal lifestyle became legendary. He once remarked that he spent &pound;2000 a month on himself, this being the cost of the bare necessities of life for a gentleman, with any luxuries costing more. At Loudwater he accumulated the largest collection of carriages in the world, brought red deer from Scotland for the park, and kept a gondola on the lake. He was a good shot, renting moors in Scotland almost every year, and a keen angler. He bred collie dogs, and kept a large stable. He entertained upon an expansive scale: the prince of Wales, later Edward VII, was a frequent visitor to Loudwater. Gordon's wardrobe was equally legendary; a fire at Loudwater was said to have destroyed 1100 of his ties alone. At the time of his death he was reputed to have owned 900 pairs of trousers and over 300 greatcoats. He travelled widely, publishing in 1892 <span class="italic">The Land of the Almighty Dollar</span>, an account of a visit to the United States. He was a founder member, and in due course president, of the Scottish Kennel Club, but resigned the year before his death after losing an action brought in the Scottish courts over the unnatural manipulation of the ears of a collie dog.<br>
<br>Gordon's domestic life became clouded in his last years, as he found it increasingly difficult to adapt his bachelor ways to the demands of a young and socially active wife. He died suddenly on 1 September 1902, apparently of heart failure, at Bad Nauheim, in Germany, where he had gone to take the cure, and he was buried there. Three years later his widow married Frank Geiger; she died in 1913. Gordon's obituarist in the <span class="italic">Financial News</span> (3 September 1902) wrote that &#145;he had a cheery smile and bright word for all who came in contact with him&#146;. Gordon was one of the most successful stockbrokers of his day, especially in the sphere of new issues. One of the most talked-about men in the City of London, he has been described as &#145;the extrovert <i>par excellence</i> of an extrovert community&#146;  (Kynaston, 1.359).<br>
