<span class="headword">Vere,  Robert  de</span>, ninth earl of Oxford, marquess of Dublin, and duke of Ireland  (1362&#150;1392), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101271/', "Thomas de Vere, eighth earl of Oxford (1336x8&#150;1371)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101272/', "Maud de Vere (1345?&#150;1413)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101271/', "Vere, Thomas de")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27975/', "Sir Ralph Ufford (d. 1346)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50027/', "Matilda of Lancaster")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Theyoungcourtier"></a>The young courtier</h2>Robert de Vere was born on 16 January 1362, and was only nine years old when he succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father. His wardship remained in the king's hands, and he was brought up in the royal household. In October 1371 his marriage was granted to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53074/', "Enguerrand (VII) de Coucy, earl of Bedford (c.1340&#150;1397)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14485/', "Isabella (1332&#150;1379)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III's")</script> eldest daughter. The intention was that he should marry their younger daughter Philippa de Coucy [<a name="cosubject_54460"></a><span class="headword">Philippa  de Vere</span>  (1367<span class="mult">x</span>70?&#150;1411)<span class="occ"></span>], who had been born at the king's residence at Eltham, and the marriage duly took place on or before 5 October 1376.<br>
<br>The de Vere family could trace their tenure of the earldom of Oxford back to the time of Stephen, but they were probably the most impoverished of the English earls, with a small inheritance mainly in Essex, Suffolk, and south Cambridgeshire. Robert de Vere's marriage to the king's granddaughter substantially enhanced the family's status, though he and his wife could not count on receiving a share of her father's inheritance. When Coucy resigned his allegiance in 1377, his inheritance passed into the hands of Richard II; it was granted to his wife with reversion of part of it to de Vere and Philippa, and some of it was later assigned for their maintenance, but de Vere may well have been disappointed in his expectation of territorial aggrandizement from his marriage. This may be one reason why he subsequently repudiated her in favour of a member of the household of Richard's consort, Anne of Bohemia.<br>
<br>By virtue of his upbringing in the royal household Robert de Vere was probably already known to the future Richard II. On St George's day (23 April) 1377, Richard (now prince of Wales) was knighted along with de Vere, his cousin Henry, earl of Derby, his uncle Thomas of Woodstock, and several other young nobles. De Vere, however, was soon to outstrip them all in favour and close friendship with the new king, who was five years his junior. It was alleged at the time of de Vere's downfall in 1388 that Sir Simon Burley (<i>d</i>. 1388) had introduced him to the king and encouraged Richard to grant the earl sole title to the share of the Coucy lands which he and his wife held jointly if his wife predeceased him. However, the hostility to Burley exhibited by the king's opponents in 1388 may have inclined them to exaggerate his part in de Vere's rise at court; it is also possible that his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28205/', "Aubrey de Vere (d. 1400)")</script>, who was acting chamberlain in the early years of Richard's reign and who, together with Burley, had substantial influence in the royal household, played a part in the earl's advancement.<br>
<br>In the early years of Richard II's reign, while de Vere was still under age, his presence at court went unremarked: he was merely one of a group of young men around the king, none of whom yet seemed marked out for particular favour. From 1384 onwards, however, Robert de Vere emerged as the king's closest and most lavishly rewarded friend. He had his own chambers in the king's residences at Eltham and Langley, and he was the recipient of extensive patronage. His opponents believed that he used his influence over the king to enrich himself. He was granted, for example, the reversion of the Audley inheritance in south-west England and the shrievalty of Rutland for life. In 1385 the king gave him the castle and lordship of Queenborough in Kent: the wording of the grant concludes &#145;the curse of God and St Edward and the king on any who do or attempt aught against this grant&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1381&#150;5</i>, 542), and in July 1387 Richard appointed him chief justice of Chester.<h2>
<a name="Irishconnections"></a>Irish connections</h2>In December 1385 the king conferred on Robert de Vere the title marquess of Dublin, granting him palatine powers in Ireland, and probably in the same year he became a knight of the Garter. The de Vere family had disposed of its meagre interests in Ireland some twenty years earlier, and Robert himself had no links with or knowledge of the lordship, nor, it seemed, any serious intention of going there himself. The title of marquess aroused particular hostility among the lords. It had hitherto been unknown in England (it may have originated in central Europe), and it placed de Vere above all the earls in precedence; yet his rise owed everything to royal favour, and nothing to his own achievements.<br>
<br>To cover the costs that he (or more probably his deputy) would incur in Ireland, de Vere was granted immediate use of the revenues from the Audley lands, and the ransom of Jean de Penthi&egrave;vre, son of Charles de Blois, claimant to the duchy of Brittany. Although de Vere himself never went to Ireland, his council concerned itself with Irish business, and in March 1386 he appointed Sir John Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1414) his deputy there. Stanley eventually took an expedition to Ireland in August 1387. Richard, however, was determined to raise de Vere still higher in rank, and on 13 October 1386 his marquessate was revoked and he was created duke of Ireland, where his powers were enhanced so that the king retained only de Vere's liege homage for the lordship. The king's closest friend, who was the first holder of the title of duke from outside the inner circles of the royal family, was now equal in status to Richard II's uncles of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and Walsingham records how indignant the other nobles were at the further promotion of such a mediocrity.<h2>
<a name="Thekingsfavourite"></a>The king's favourite</h2>The nature of de Vere's influence over the king has provoked much speculation. There was certainly an emotional charge to the relationship, as there evidently was between de Vere and his second wife, but the English chroniclers find difficulty in explaining the hold he had over the king. Walsingham attributes it to magic spells cast by a friar in the royal household, and also hints at a sexual relationship. Although there are some similarities to the friendship between Edward II and Piers Gaveston, there is no evidence for a homosexual relationship between the two men, but the possibility of a formal compact of brotherhood, as has been suggested between Gaveston and Edward, should not be entirely ruled out. Froissart says that the king was so blinded by de Vere that &#145;if he had said black was white the king would not have gainsaid him&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres</span>, 12.239). Froissart also, however, suggests that de Vere had an attractive side to his personality, for at the time of his exile he describes him as having &#145;sensitivity, honour, fair speech and great generosity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chroniques</span>, 14.33).<br>
<br>By 1387 de Vere had acquired the means to live in some opulence. After his downfall he was found to have had at Chester silver plate worth nearly &pound;100 and other possessions worth over &pound;300. Among these were a set of wall or bed hangings embroidered with butterflies, other embroidered hangings, four liveries for his minstrels, and six liveries each for his valets and grooms.<br>
<br>Yet it was not just the favour shown to de Vere that aroused hostility, but also his own behaviour, especially his attempts to undermine the relationship between John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and the king. De Vere may have had a hand in the episode at the Salisbury parliament in 1384 when a Carmelite friar accused Gaunt of treason. He denied any complicity in the affair, but the friar tried to implicate him, and it is perhaps significant that the friar had been saying mass before the king in de Vere's chamber immediately before he made the accusation. There is more reason to suppose that de Vere was implicated in the plot against Gaunt's life hatched in February 1385: Walsingham and the Monk of Evesham accuse the young men around the king of complicity in the plot, while the Monk of Westminster singles out de Vere and two other earls for specific mention. De Vere served with a substantial retinue on the king's expedition to Scotland in the summer of 1385, and Froissart says that his influence lay behind Richard's decision at Edinburgh to return home, rejecting Gaunt's advice to move further into Scotland. The Monk of Westminster, however, does not suggest that de Vere had any part in the decision.<h2>
<a name="Divorceandsecondmarriage"></a>Divorce and second marriage</h2>By 1386 Robert de Vere's standing with his fellow nobles was already low; what finally destroyed it was his repudiation of his wife in the following year and his marriage to <a name="cosubject_54459"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Lancecrona</span> <span class="st"> [Agnes  de Vere]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1382&#150;1388), a <span class="occ">lady of the royal household</span>. Little is known about her origins. Walsingham believes that she was a saddler's daughter, but it has been suggested on the basis of her name that she belonged to a German (or possibly Netherlandish) noble family called Landskron. She had come to England with Queen Anne in 1382, and is described by the Monk of Westminster as a &#145;woman of the queen's chamber&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Chronicle</span>, 188&#150;9). She may indeed have been of German rather than Czech origin, but such a distinction would probably not have appeared significant at the English court in the 1380s. From the point of view of the English nobles and their wives, her lowly status, and her membership of a group of Bohemians around the queen who were generally unpopular, were quite sufficient for de Vere's affair with her to cause grave offence. His first wife was Edward III's granddaughter, and her royal uncles, notably Gloucester, were strongly protective of her and, later, sought to shield her from the consequences of her husband's disgrace and exile.<br>
<br>Westminster suggests that de Vere &#145;grew to detest&#146; his first wife, who can scarcely have been out of her teens when he decided to divorce her. He lobbied for a divorce at the papal curia, allegedly with perjured witnesses. Froissart maintains that he had no good reason to divorce her, but did so for frivolous reasons. Although the editors of the Dieulacres chronicle cast doubt on whether the divorce was granted, the Monk of Westminster records that it was annulled by papal bull in October 1389, and it is therefore probably safe to assume that it did indeed take place. It is not clear, however, whether Agnes was enthusiastic about de Vere's advances: two of his retainers were later accused of abducting her and taking her to Chester, where de Vere was residing in the summer of 1387. After de Vere's downfall various items belonging to Agnes and her servants were found at Chester. They included two new saddles &#145;pour damoiselles de Boeme&#146;, and one old saddle in Bohemian style  (TNA: PRO, E 36/66). These are the last traces of her: she disappeared from public view as suddenly as she had arrived.<h2>
<a name="FromRadcotBridgetoLouvain"></a>From Radcot Bridge to Louvain</h2>Robert de Vere's marriage to Agnes Lancecrona, and the dishonouring of Edward III's granddaughter that it implied, was undoubtedly a major reason for the intensification of hostility to him in the summer and autumn of 1387. Walsingham suggests that the king supported de Vere's pursuit of Agnes Lancecrona, but that the king's uncles, especially Gloucester, were highly indignant at the affront to their niece. He goes on to say that Gloucester now looked for an opportunity to avenge the insult. For his part, the king came to rely on de Vere even more in these months, and the latter's appointment as justice of Chester was intended to ensure that the royal earldom, with its considerable military potential, was in safe hands. In November 1387 both the king and his opponents began to muster their forces. The duke of Gloucester and the earls of Arundel and Warwick (three of the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53093/', "lords appellant")</script>) appeared in arms at Harringay in mid-November, and accused de Vere, along with four other associates of the king, of treason. De Vere meanwhile was raising an army in Cheshire, which set out to march south in mid-December. On 20 December 1387 de Vere's army was routed by the appellants at Radcot Bridge in Oxfordshire. De Vere himself escaped, but many of his followers were killed, and de Vere displayed little military skill. Indeed, one source reports that some of his troops deserted even before they encountered the appellant army, while Walsingham goes so far as to suggest that de Vere himself contemplated flight before the battle, and had to have his courage reinforced by his men. Ralph, Lord Basset, seems to have spoken for many when he remarked that &#145;I am not going to offer to have my head broken for the duke of Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knighton's Chronicle</span>, 407).<br>
<br>The appellants' victory at Radcot Bridge was decisive: by the end of December Richard had agreed that de Vere and other lords who had been close to the king should be tried for treason in the Merciless Parliament which opened in February 1388. De Vere, of course, was tried in his absence. He was accused, along with four other leading familiars of the king, of accroaching royal power, of benefiting improperly from royal patronage, of encouraging the king to resist the council imposed on him in the parliament of October 1386, and of manipulating the law for their own advantage. De Vere in particular was accused of separating England from Ireland by encouraging the king to grant him the lordship of Ireland without the assent of the community in either land, and of raising an army in Cheshire to destroy the duke of Gloucester and the other appellants. He was found guilty, and sentenced <i>in absentia</i> to death and forfeiture of all his lands and titles.<br>
<br>After the rout at Radcot Bridge de Vere escaped first of all to Bruges, and then to Dordrecht in Holland. The count of Holland, Albrecht of Bavaria, refused to countenance his presence in Dordrecht, and he moved on to Utrecht. In the late summer of 1389 he went to Paris, where he met his fellow exiles Michael de la Pole and Alexander Neville, the deposed archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1392). De la Pole died while de Vere was in Paris, and Walsingham says that he left de Vere such goods as he had been able to save from forfeiture. His estranged wife's father, Enguerrand de Coucy, however, was influential at the French court and was determined to drive him out of France. De Vere asked Charles VI of France to intercede on his behalf with the duchess of Brabant, who according to Froissart gave him leave to reside in Louvain. His mother visited him in 1391, and in February of the following year Richard II suggested that he should be allowed to return to England. The council objected, however, and his death shortly afterwards removed a potentially difficult issue for Richard. De Vere died some time before 5 August 1392, probably at or near Louvain: Thomas Otterbourne records that he was killed by a wild boar while out hunting, but his story is not confirmed by any other contemporary source.<h2>
<a name="Familyfortunes"></a>Family fortunes</h2>Walsingham says that de Vere died in poverty and distress, but he had had some success during his exile in obtaining payment of instalments of the ransom of Jean de Penthi&egrave;vre. The dukes of Berri and Burgundy agreed that he should be paid 27,600 francs of the ransom in 1388, but it is uncertain how much he had actually received by the time of his death. He had no children, and in January 1393 his uncle, Aubrey de Vere, who was his heir, successfully petitioned for the entailed lands of the earldom of Oxford and the title of earl to be restored to him.<br>
<br>Robert de Vere was buried at Louvain, but in September 1395 Richard II ordered that his body should be exhumed and brought to England for reburial at Earls Colne Priory, Essex, the family's burial place. Walsingham describes how, in a bizarre demonstration of his continued affection for his favourite, Richard had the coffin opened so that he could look upon de Vere's face and touch his fingers. De Vere's mother (though not, apparently, his estranged wife) and various bishops, abbots, and priors were present at the ceremony. None of the nobles came, however, &#145;because they had not yet digested the hatred they had for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trokelowe</span>, 185). His tomb does not survive.<br>
<br>After his exile, his first wife went to live with de Vere's mother, who according to Westminster had strongly disapproved of her son's affair with Agnes Lancecrona, and held Philippa &#145;more dear than if she had been her own daughter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Chronicle</span>, 190&#150;91). She was always known as the duchess of Ireland, despite her husband's forfeiture of the title, and Richard II ensured that she received an adequate maintenance. De Vere's mother farmed her exiled son's lands, and Philippa was granted an annuity of 100 marks from the revenues of these lands, rising to 300 marks after de Vere's death. In 1398 she was granted dower from her husband's estates. Early in Henry IV's reign she and her elder sister Mary agreed to divide their father's inheritance between them, with Philippa receiving the English and Mary the French lands. She was at court from time to time in Henry's reign, and accompanied Richard II's widow, Queen Isabella, to Calais on her way back to France in 1401. She died, in England, on 24 September 1411: it is not known where she is buried.<br>
