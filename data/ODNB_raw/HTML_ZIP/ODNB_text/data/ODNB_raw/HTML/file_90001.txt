<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ryder,  Sydney Franklin Thomas <span class="st"> [Don]</span></span>, Baron Ryder of Eaton Hastings  (1916&#150;2003), <span class="occ">journalist and industrialist</span>, was born on 16 September 1916 at 20 Balfour Road, Ealing, London, the son of John Ryder and his wife, Amelia Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graimes. At the time of his birth his father was serving as a driver in the Royal Field Artillery; he had formerly been a carman, and was later a town clerk. Ryder won a scholarship to Ealing county school, but left at the age of sixteen without qualifications. Fascinated by the stock market, he embarked on a career as a financial journalist. His first job was as assistant to the city editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, and he later joined the <span class="italic">Stock Exchange Gazette</span>, where he remained until the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1939 Ryder was assigned to a Territorial Army anti-aircraft unit. He devoted himself to the study of gunnery, later joining the trials wing of the school of anti-aircraft artillery, where he worked on the development of rockets. He also wrote the official training manual for the Bofors gun. Ryder went back to the <span class="italic">Stock Exchange Gazette</span> after the war, but soon switched to the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, where he started the first column of investment advice. In 1950 he returned to the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> as editor. On 18 March the same year he married Eileen Winifred Dodds, the nineteen-year-old daughter of William Dodds, accountant. They had one daughter, Jill (<i>b</i>. 1950), and one son, Michael (<i>b</i>. 1953).<br>
<br>Ryder's main interest was in the business rather than the editorial side of newspapers&#151;he once remarked that financial journalism was an excellent preparation for management&#151;and the opportunity for making the switch came in 1960, when the International Publishing Corporation (IPC), owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and other publications, took over Kelly Iliffe Holdings, the publishing group which owned the <span class="italic">Stock Exchange Gazette</span>. Ryder offered to buy some of the Kelly Iliffe magazines, and although the offer was rejected his ideas for developing the business impressed Cecil King, then head of IPC. Ryder was made managing director of Kelly Iliffe and formed a close partnership with King. Three years later he was promoted to the much bigger job of running Albert E. Reed (later Reed Paper Group), an old-established paper-maker which had been supplying the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> with newsprint since the 1920s and in which IPC had a minority stake.<br>
<br>Reed at the time faced serious problems, stemming in large part from the creation of the European Free Trade Association in 1960. This arrangement&#151;a rather weak riposte by the UK and other European countries to the creation of the six-nation Common Market in 1958&#151;had exposed the British paper industry for the first time to unrestricted competition from low-cost Scandinavian mills. Ryder set about reshaping the company with enormous energy and determination. His strategy was to convert Reed's paper machines to grades which were less vulnerable to Scandinavian competition, to acquire pulp and paper assets outside Britain, and to diversify into other industries. The growing popularity of takeovers during the 1960s suited Ryder's expansionist ambitions. He was a &#145;hands-on&#146; manager, and became famous for his eighteen-hour working days. A bundle of nervous energy, he was once described as a cross between Emil Z&aacute;topek and Samuel Smiles  (Foster and Bull). Ryder believed that the British paper industry as a whole needed rationalization and it was largely at his prompting that the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation&#151;an agency created by the Labour government to promote mergers in fragmented industries&#151;undertook a study of the sector in 1968. Ryder's hope was that the corporation would endorse the idea of combining Reed with the other giant of the industry, Bowater. But this plan did not find favour with the corporation, and the two companies went their separate ways.<br>
<br>Under Ryder's leadership Reed reduced its dependence on imported pulp, invested in grades based on waste paper (including the country's first plant for &#145;de-inking&#146; old newspapers), and expanded the company's business in packaging materials, building products, and paper merchanting. Reed's transformation from a paper-making group into an industrial conglomerate was taken even further when Ryder merged it with its principal shareholder, IPC, to form Reed International. Ryder can be criticized for expanding Reed too fast and on too large a scale, especially in South Africa and Canada, and by the time he retired in 1974 the company's finances were under some strain. Yet Ryder's stewardship could not be regarded as a failure. Building on the management accounting systems installed by his predecessor, he decentralized the group and pushed more responsibility down to the mill managers. He was a modernizing figure who greatly improved the quality of management at all levels, and he inspired considerable respect among many of those who worked for him. Although not all his diversifications were successful he rescued a moribund company, and the group of businesses which he assembled through mergers and acquisitions contained some valuable assets&#151;notably publishing&#151;on which his successors were able to build.<br>
<br>These achievements made Ryder a public figure&#151;he was knighted in 1972&#151;and it was not entirely surprising that, when he retired from Reed, he should have been asked by the Labour government to be an industrial adviser, and then, in 1975, to take command of the new industrial development agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB). He was made a life peer as Baron Ryder of Eaton Hastings in the same year. The NEB was to some extent a successor to the IRC, but it had more sweeping powers. Its intended role&#151;reflecting a leftward shift in Labour's thinking about industrial policy&#151;was not just to merge companies, but also, where necessary, to take them over and improve their performance. Harold Wilson, the prime minister, and Tony Benn, his industry minister, saw Ryder as a professional manager with experience and skills which could play a vital role in the government's industrial strategy. Ryder, for his part, had no strong political opinions, but shared Wilson's view that British industry needed a thorough shake-up and that government could and should play an active part in that process. He saw the NEB in technocratic rather than political terms, somewhat akin to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which was widely (though wrongly) credited with orchestrating that country's remarkable industrial success. The NEB, Ryder said at the time of his appointment, would not interfere in the day-to-day management of the companies in which it held shares, but would act like the board of a multinational company, &#145;analysing and checking and occasionally altering&#146;  (Ensor).<br>
<br>Ryder saw himself as engaged in a patriotic crusade to streamline and professionalize British industry. But the environment in which he now found himself was intensely political and, as far as the business community was concerned, extremely hostile. The NEB, with its potentially aggressive mission, was regarded with much more suspicion than the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, which had operated mostly through co-operation and persuasion. To make matters worse, the NEB's portfolio was dominated by a few &#145;lame ducks&#146;, which had been taken over by the government because of deep-seated managerial and financial problems. The biggest of these was British Leyland Motor Corporation. British Leyland, which brought together virtually all the British-owned car and truck manufacturers, had been formed by a government-induced merger in 1968, in the hope that it would match the economies of scale enjoyed by rivals such as General Motors and Ford. But the proponents of the merger had failed to appreciate the difficulty of integrating British Leyland's many constituent businesses, and after an erratic performance in its first few years the company almost went bankrupt in the summer of 1974. A new Labour government had taken office earlier in the year, and for Harold Wilson and his colleagues, who had presided over the creation of British Leyland in 1968, the collapse of the company was unthinkable. They provided emergency loans to keep the company afloat, while at the same time setting up a committee, chaired by Ryder, to examine the company's future.<br>
<br>The Ryder report, <span class="italic">British Leyland: the Next Decade</span>, published in 1975, concluded that, subject to changes in internal organization and a substantial increase in investment (to be funded largely by the government), British Leyland could become a profitable, world-leading automotive business. Although some commentators warned that the sales projections on which the report was founded were unrealistic, Ryder's recommendations were accepted by the government as the basis for a massive injection of public funds&#151;some &pound;1400 million in total. British Leyland became a ward of the state, with Ryder and the NEB charged with ensuring that the promised improvements in productivity were achieved. But the company's internal weaknesses, both in the field of labour relations and in the quality of its products, had been vastly underestimated, and the new management team installed by the NEB could make little impression on them. Despite an ambitious attempt to introduce a measure of worker participation, the company was dogged by strikes and other forms of disruption, mostly initiated by shop stewards without the approval of their trade unions. Some poorly designed new models contributed to a continuing decline in market share and profitability. It was not until the appointment of Sir Michael Edwardes as chairman of British Leyland (after Ryder's departure from the NEB) that the situation began to improve.<br>
<br>Ryder spent less than two years at the NEB&#151;he resigned in August 1977&#151;and it was not a happy period. The assumptions contained in his British Leyland report were clearly invalid, and his attempts to influence management decisions from his seat at the NEB probably compounded the company's problems. Ryder was also subjected to personal attacks, including a bizarre accusation by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> that he had connived in bribery and corruption. A former employee had provided the newspaper with a letter, allegedly written by Ryder to the managing director of the company, in which he had agreed to the use of bribes to win customers. The letter was shown to be a forgery, and Ryder won substantial damages from the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Whether a businessman with different skills and greater political sensitivity could have made a success of the NEB is doubtful. Its ability to act as a catalyst for industrial change, as Ryder had hoped, was limited by the legacy of weak companies with which it was saddled from the start. Some Labour Party advisers had likened the NEB to Italy's IRI, a state holding company which later became notorious for the size of its losses. Fortunately the NEB was never allowed to grow as large as IRI, but the comparison reflected the confused thinking which lay behind the NEB's creation. By the end of the 1970s there was growing scepticism about the efficacy of state intervention in industry, and the demise of the NEB under the Thatcher government was not much regretted.<br>
<br>Ryder's name became indelibly associated with his report on British Leyland, and the failure of his prescription for the company severely damaged his reputation. In his earlier role at Reed, however, he made a significant and positive impact on the British business scene. He was part of a new generation of modernizing managers, alongside such men as Frank Kearton at Courtaulds and Arnold Weinstock at the General Electric Company, who came to the fore during the 1960s and 1970s. At a time when the management of many large British companies was flabby and conservative, they set an example of professionalism, energy, and dedication which was badly needed. After his resignation from the NEB Ryder played no further role in public life. He lived in retirement in Yorkshire until his death, of myelofibrosis, at Cottingley Hall Nursing Home, Bradford Road, Bingley, Yorkshire, on 12 May 2003. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife, Eileen, having predeceased him.<br>
