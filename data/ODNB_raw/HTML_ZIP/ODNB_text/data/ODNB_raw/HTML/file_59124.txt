<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Durrell,  Gerald Malcolm</span>  (1925&#150;1995), <span class="occ">author, naturalist, and animal conservationist</span>, was born in Jamshedpur, India, on 7 January 1925, the fifth and youngest child of Lawrence Samuel Durrell (1884&#150;1928), civil engineer, and his wife, Louisa Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixie (1886&#150;1964). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39830/', "Lawrence George Durrell (1912&#150;1990)")</script>, poet and novelist, was his eldest brother; a second child died in infancy, but another brother and sister survived to adulthood. Following the death of Durrell's father in April 1928, the family uprooted themselves from India and went to England, moving to Bournemouth early in 1931. There Durrell indulged his passion for small creatures of all kinds, announcing to his mother when he was six that he would have his own zoo one day&#151;an ambition he was to pursue with extraordinary single-mindedness. Meanwhile his entire formal education amounted to two terms at a prep school. In 1935 the Durrell family again moved, settling on the Greek paradise island of Corfu. This was perhaps the great defining moment in Durrell's life. There he lived out an idyll of which other children could only dream. In the three books he later wrote about his Corfu childhood&#151;notably <span class="italic">My Family and other Animals</span> (1956)&#151;he described his forays on foot to look for wildlife, and the impact his pet scorpions and snakes had on the rest of the household. Out of a bevy of eccentric private tutors, two laid the foundations of the man of achievement he became. The first was his brother Lawrence, who instilled in him a passion for language and encouraged him to take his first steps in creative writing. The second was a Corfiot medic, Dr Theo Stephanides, a biologist and polymath, who gave the boy a marvellous grounding in field biology and a broad appreciation of life on earth in all its diversity.<br>
<br>With the onset of the Second World War the Corfu years came to an end and Durrell returned to Bournemouth with his mother. In 1945, after various odd jobs with animals, he became a student keeper at Whipsnade Zoo, where he learned the basics of large animal husbandry and first became aware of the role of man in the extinction of species. At the age of twenty-one he inherited &pound;3000 from his father's legacy. This enabled him to fulfil another ambition&#151;to collect wild animals for zoos. Between 1947 and 1951 he undertook two major collecting expeditions to the British Cameroons and another to British Guiana.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1951 Durrell married Jacqueline Sonia (Jacquie) Rasen (<i>b</i>. 1929), a student opera singer, who staunchly encouraged him in the next turn in his life. Jacquie encouraged his zoo ambitions and persuaded him to write his first book, <span class="italic">The Overloaded Ark</span> (1953), about his first Cameroons expedition, and two further animal books in quick succession&#151;<span class="italic">Three Singles to Adventure</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">The Bafut Beagles</span> (1954). The freshness of these books, their charm, their ebullient humour, their totally new approach to wild animals and wild places, and the vivid, lyrical quality of their descriptive writing ensured their instant success worldwide. Almost overnight Durrell became one of the finest nature writers of the century, an inspiration to millions. Now a fully-fledged professional author, he set off on more collecting expeditions, resulting in further animal travel books including <span class="italic">The Drunken Forest</span> (1956), set in Argentina and Paraguay, and <span class="italic">Zoo in my Luggage</span> (1960), featuring one of the great characters of travel literature, Durrell's regal African drinking companion, the legendary Fon of Bafut. But it was his classic evocation of his childhood idyll in Corfu, <span class="italic">My Family and other Animals</span>, that brought him true fame and fortune.<br>
<br>Durrell had never forgotten his boyhood ambition of founding a zoo of his own. In 1957 he returned from the Cameroons with a large collection of animals that was to form its nucleus. This was later transferred to Jersey, where he had taken a lease on the house and grounds of Les Augr&egrave;s Manor, Trinity, and was first opened to the public on 29 March 1959 as Jersey Zoo, which has become one of the world's finest small zoos. As a conservationist Durrell was a pioneer a long way ahead of most of the field. He had always intended that Jersey should become a conservation zoo dedicated to the breeding of animals in danger of extinction and their eventual return to the wild. With the founding of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust on 6 July 1963 his life's mission got under way. Within a few years the trust had established breeding groups of many species of endangered mammals, reptiles, and birds, and had begun to return their progeny to the wild. In 1976 Durrell created what he called a mini-university in a manor house adjacent to the zoo to provide intensive training for conservation workers from around the world, so that they could begin the process of saving species in their country of origin&#151;arguably the greatest innovative achievement of his life. By 2000 more than 1000 students from over 100 countries had received training at the International Training Centre. Durrell also established affiliate organizations in the United States and Canada to fund his work, which have since become international organizations in their own right. In 1989 the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) was founded at the University of Kent.<br>
<br>For his contributions to animal conservation and animal literature Durrell received many honours. Though he had received virtually no formal education, he was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Yale (1977), Durham (1988), and Kent (1989), and among other honours was appointed officer of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard in 1981, and OBE in 1982. Over the years the private man became a public figure of international stature. Slim and lissom as a young man, with film star looks and a debonair aura, Durrell rounded out in maturity into a larger than life, bacchanalian figure, endowed with immense charisma and a hilarious sense of humour&#151;but also a proneness to depression and despair. In reality he was a latter-day St Francis confronted with an animal holocaust that St Francis could not have envisaged in his worst nightmare. His struggle to save the animal world was eventually to cost him his health, his happiness, and his marriage.<br>
<br>In 1976 Durrell separated from his first wife. The next year, while on one of his many lecture tours to the USA, he met Lee Wilson McGeorge (<i>b</i>. 1949), a zoology graduate working on a PhD at Duke University, North Carolina. After their marriage in 1979 they travelled the world together, collecting endangered animals for Jersey Zoo, monitoring overseas conservation projects, jointly and singly authoring books (notably <span class="italic">The Amateur Naturalist</span>, 1982, with sales of several million worldwide), and taking part in many major documentary television series broadcast on networks around the world. In all Durrell wrote and presented more than 175 television documentaries, and wrote forty-two books, published in more than thirty countries. He died in Jersey on 30 January 1995 from complications following a liver transplant. He was survived by his second wife (there were no children of either marriage), who took over the reins as honorary director of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, later renamed the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in honour of its founder, to help carry on the task of animal conservation at the cutting edge in the twenty-first century.<br>
