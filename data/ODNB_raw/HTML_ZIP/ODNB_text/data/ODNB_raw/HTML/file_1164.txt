<span class="headword">Baldwin</span> <span class="st"> [Baldwin of Forde]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1125&#150;1190), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born in Exeter, probably the son of Hugh d'Eu, archdeacon of Totnes, and a woman of unknown name. This parentage is suggested by Baldwin's having succeeded to the archdeaconry of Totnes on Hugh's death and by his being called Master Baldwin fitz Hugh in a charter. Gervase of Canterbury's claim that Baldwin was born of people of no account expressed the contempt of an aristocratic community. His mother became a nun and must have been literate, since Roger, a monk at Forde, asked for a copy to be made for her in readable letters of the <span class="italic">Visions</span> of Elisabeth of Sch&ouml;nau.<h2>
<a name="Monkandreligiouswriter"></a>Monk and religious writer</h2>The decade of Baldwin's birth is deduced from the fact that Eugenius III appointed him to be tutor to his nephew in 1150 or 1151: it is likely that he was then in his mid-twenties. Before that he studied law in Bologna under the future Urban III, and his writings suggest that he had followed theology in the schools, perhaps at Laon. Exeter probably provided his earlier education. By 1155 he was back home as a clerk serving the bishop of Exeter, Robert of Chichester. This is the most likely time that he himself taught; the monk Roger mentioned above recalled that Baldwin had read his boyish verses and suggested subjects to him.<br>
<br>Bishop Bartholomew made Baldwin archdeacon of Totnes&#151;after his father's death&#151;on 23 May 1162, in which post he was active until about 1170 when he became a Cistercian at Forde Abbey. His decision reflects the pressures on the bishop and his clerks from the increasingly bitter disagreement between Henry II and Thomas Becket. Bartholomew on the whole stuck by Becket: his clerks numbered relatives of John of Salisbury, Thomas's confidential clerk and companion in exile. At this stage John wrote warmly of Baldwin's loyalty and integrity.<br>
<br>An abbey had existed at Forde only since 1141. It must have been attracting other recruits besides Baldwin since in 1172 it was able to found a daughter house. Within a short time the new and able monk became abbot at Forde. Exactly when is unknown, but by 1173 Baldwin was at the general chapter at C&icirc;teaux where he had &#145;secret matters&#146; to discuss with the abbot of C&icirc;teaux, who had been asked by the pope that year to try to make peace between Henry II and his sons  (Baldwin, <span class="italic">De commendatione fidei</span>, preface, section 4, 344; cf.xxix&#150;xxx). Baldwin's years as abbot saw the pope put Baldwin's legal training to use, appointing him judge-delegate in a number of cases, when he often worked with bishops and gained a reputation as a man with a future. His writings show other sides of his character.<br>
<br>The longest of Baldwin's writings, <span class="italic">De sacramento altaris</span>, was dedicated to Bartholomew. Twelve manuscripts survive showing that it continued to be read into the fifteenth century, getting attention well beyond his own order, though not much outside England. It explores the biblical account of the institution of the eucharist and its forerunner, the passover. The influence of Augustine is very strong. Baldwin's twenty-two sermons, on the other hand, most of which started as addresses to his community, echo Bernard of Clairvaux, and the biblical book which that saint loved best, the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>. Here too twelve manuscripts from England and northern France survive, the latest from the late fifteenth century. Two sermons were printed at Cambridge in 1521. Another work, on faith, survives in two English manuscripts, though at least five others are known to have existed before the dissolution.<h2>
<a name="Bishopandarchbishop"></a>Bishop and archbishop</h2>Not surprisingly, in 1178 Baldwin attracted the notice of a cardinal visiting England, Peter of St Agatha, who recommended him to Alexander III as a possible cardinal since he was &#145;held in very high esteem by the whole Cistercian order, because of his very broad culture, his worthiness and his piety.&#146;  (Glorieux). Perhaps these very qualities, as well as the political role he had played in 1173, induced Henry II to support his election to Worcester in 1180. He was consecrated bishop on 10 August. In this new role he continued to act as judge-delegate, an activity reflected in the notable Worcester collection of decretals, possibly put together by Master Silvester, a clerk whom Baldwin had inherited from his predecessor, Bishop Roger, and whom he was to take with him to Canterbury.<br>
<br>Although Walter Map, scarcely a friend of Cistercians, praised Baldwin's determination to continue to write after he had become a bishop, the only piece definitely linked to the Worcester years is a sermon on the cross written for the lately reformed canons of Waltham.<br>
<br>On Sunday 22 July 1184 Baldwin intervened to delay the hanging outside the city of a seducer and thief who had been condemned before the king. His foolhardiness, inspired by respect for the day, the feast of St Mary Magdalen, instead of bringing down royal wrath, seems to have increased the king's opinion of him, for Henry began to move him higher, to Canterbury, vacant since February. Negotiations to secure the agreement of both the bishops of the province and of the monks who served the cathedral took until the middle of December. Baldwin's enthronement occurred on 19 May 1185, by which time his pallium had arrived from Rome.<br>
<br>Baldwin's Canterbury <i>acta</i> show that he had an active concern for his diocese and province. There is little specifically Cistercian in them, except for a moving letter to the abbots' meeting at C&icirc;teaux asking for their prayers, and pleading that the duties of his new office prevented him from being with them. A very positive achievement was his assertion of Canterbury's claims over Wales. Urban III created him legate on 17 or 18 December 1185, but it was not until June 1187 that Baldwin travelled towards the Welsh border, and then crossed briefly over to &#145;visit&#146; it formally. In the next year, from early March to the middle of April, he travelled more widely through the principality than probably any archbishop, everywhere preaching the crusade. His route can be reconstructed thanks to the lively account written by one of his companions, the testy and witty Gerald of Wales. Gerald provides the only good description of what the archbishop looked like: &#145;swarthy &hellip; with an honest, venerable face, only moderately tall, of good physique and inclined to be thin rather than corpulent&#146;  (Gerald of Wales, <span class="italic">Journey</span>, 205). In each cathedral Baldwin celebrated mass, symbolizing his superior position as legate and archbishop. For a sixty-year-old he showed impressive stamina, even urging his companions to dismount and walk up a valley to make them fit for the journey to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>Baldwin had taken the cross in March 1185, when bad relations within the royal family and between Henry and Philip Augustus made any expedition very unlikely. In 1188 Angevin&#150;Capetian relations were better, and circumstances for a crusade more propitious. Although Baldwin's sermons often had to be translated into Welsh, Gerald claimed that 3000 took the cross. No sooner was Baldwin back in England than he set out for Normandy to try to make peace between the old king and his restless sons. He only returned to England at the end of July 1189, by when Henry was dead (6 July).<h2>
<a name="TheHackingtondispute"></a>The Hackington dispute</h2>By that time Baldwin's quarrel at Canterbury had reached its nadir, the monks having been virtually imprisoned in their monastery since January 1188. It is hardly surprising that the Canterbury historian Gervase thought that Baldwin's keenness to preach in Wales was caused chiefly by the desire to put a distance between himself and the community. The whole story goes back to December 1185, a year after Baldwin's election, when he began to try to regain control of some property and revenues that his predecessor had let slip into the hands of the monks. His full purpose emerged in 1186, when Urban III gave him permission to build and endow a new collegiate church at Hackington, just outside Canterbury. He claimed to be fulfilling an intention of his two great predecessors, Anselm and Becket, and that he would dedicate it to the latter, whom he said lacked churches in his honour. To the monks the scheme was totally unacceptable, especially when they realized that Baldwin had got authority to divert up to half of the offerings in the cathedral, most of which were given at the martyr's shrine. It seemed to them that the saint upon whom they depended was to be hijacked on behalf of an institution which they foresaw as the beginning of the end for their wealth and privileges. Massive documentation survives from the struggle: a narrative account by Gervase, and a dossier of over 550 letters, compiled by another monk, Reginald. This last reveals that the Canterbury Benedictines bombarded everyone they could think of&#151;the German emperor, the king of France, cardinals, bishops, and abbots, these last including even Baldwin's Cistercian colleagues, the abbots of C&icirc;teaux and Clairvaux, and the general chapter of the order.<br>
<br>The monks posed as the heirs and protectors of Becket, and Gervase records how one young monk dreamed that Thomas put Baldwin to flight with a burning sword. His prior interpreted the fact that the sword was inscribed &#145;The sword of blessed Peter&#146; as a sure sign that Rome would ultimately quash Baldwin's plans. Now it is clear that Rome was in no very good position to settle anything quickly, since no fewer than four men served as pope between 1185 and the end of the struggle in 1189. The claim that Thomas and the monks were one now seems odd, since, as Barlow has shown, &#145;His lasting unpopularity with the monks is undoubted&#146;  (F. Barlow, <span class="italic">Thomas Becket</span> 1986, 271). Symptomatic of that is the fact that the candidates whom the monks would have preferred in 1172 and 1184 (and later in 1191), Odo of Canterbury, abbot of Battle, and Reginald fitz Jocelin, had both opposed Becket when he was alive. It is also clear that Baldwin was not the first, or last, archbishop to have difficulties with Christ Church. It was a rich and touchy body with which an austere Cistercian might well have found it hard to establish friendly relations, but it may well have been crucial that in the early days of his primacy Baldwin spent little time at Canterbury. Certainly his high ideals about the corporate life of a religious community, as expressed in one of his Forde sermons, never stood a chance of taking shape at Christ Church once he had embarked upon the Hackington scheme.<br>
<br>Baldwin's persistence can look like mere stubbornness, but it seems more likely that his previous experience as well as a real need had more to do with it. His promotion probably rested principally upon his training as a canon lawyer, which must have predisposed him to believe that if he had a pope on his side, as well as the king, he would triumph. But he never had any pope for very long. As archbishop of a church served by monks he lacked any canonries and lesser posts in his cathedral with which to reward loyal clerks. At Hackington he would have many&#151;the monks reckoned he planned on sixty or seventy&#151;and so he stood his ground. But the monks did all they could to frustrate him, deploying people and money at Rome to good effect, so that Baldwin was forced to temporize over papal mandates ordering him to desist while leaning more heavily on what the king might do by threats. Finally it was the new king, Richard I, who in November 1189 oversaw the patching up of a compromise. The monks were pleased that Baldwin had to give up the Hackington plan but dismayed that he got permission to try something similar at Lambeth. His successor, Hubert Walter, attempted this, but eventually the monks forced him to desist.<h2>
<a name="Crusadeanddeath"></a>Crusade and death</h2>Richard's motive in making peace at Canterbury was his determination to go on crusade. Baldwin left England in March 1190 with an advance party, never to return. He travelled with Hubert Walter, the bishop of Salisbury, his own nephew Joseph, a poet, and his old companion at Forde, Abbot Robert. The party made their way steadily south through France, reaching Marseilles at the beginning of August. The voyage to Tyre took about five weeks, and by 12 October they were at Acre. It was there that Baldwin died on 19 November, sickened perhaps by the army's dissolute behaviour. He made Hubert Walter his executor, and the latter saw to the pay of some twenty knights and fifty serjeants. Baldwin also left some of his vestments to the community at Canterbury, a generous gesture which did not soften the picture that they kept of him.<br>
<br>Baldwin's whole career reveals a deeply spiritual person, and it is striking that now his writings probably circulate more widely and in more languages than those of any other medieval archbishop of Canterbury, with the one exception of Anselm. This spirituality was recognized by Urban III, who commented that whereas Becket when he dismounted went straight to the hall and Richard of Dover went to the barn, Baldwin went to the church. Yet in a now lost letter the same pope is supposed to have addressed him as &#145;the most fervent monk, warm abbot, lukewarm bishop, negligent archbishop&#146;  (Gerald of Wales, <span class="italic">Speculum</span> in <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 4.76). Although Baldwin was capable of serious errors of judgement, like the promotion of the worthless Roger Norreys (<i>d</i>. 1223), first to be prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, and then to be abbot of Evesham, Urban's comment still seems too hard. But it is easy now to see that the archbishop's decision to create a collegiate church made an unbreakable rod for his own back, forcing him into excessive dependence on royal support.<br>
