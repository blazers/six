<span class="headword">Ravenhill,  Alice</span>  (1859&#150;1954), <span class="occ">educationist and promoter of the household science movement</span>, was born on 31 March 1859 in Snaresbrook, Essex, the fourth of the seven children of John Ravenhill (1824&#150;1894), naval architect and marine engineer, and his wife, Fanny Pocock (<i>c</i>.1831&#150;1903), daughter of Thomas Pike Pocock and Martha Pike.<br>
<br>Like many women of the nineteenth century Ravenhill was thwarted in her intellectual ambitions by middle-class conventions which stressed &#145;accomplishments&#146; rather than academic achievement. She was educated privately and at residential schools in Richmond and St John's Wood, but her father prohibited her from following her first ambitions to train as a nurse or attend the National Training School for Cookery. A holiday in Weymouth, however, sparked her interest in geology, and she later taught herself biology and physiology, surreptitiously dissecting snails, worms, and even an ox's eye in her bedroom. It was only after her father's financial collapse while Ravenhill was in her late twenties that she was able to pursue her interests in science and social welfare&#151;interests which stemmed from an &#145;unquenchable search for knowledge and childhood yearning to help my fellow man to a happier and less-troubled existence&#146;  (Ravenhill, 45). Opting for the more respectable preventative health work, she enrolled in the National Health Society's year-long training course for county council hygiene lecturers&#151;at the time the only such course open to women intending to work in public health. Two fellow students, Lucy Deane and Rose Squire, later became the first women sanitary inspectors and subsequently two of the first women factory inspectors. Ravenhill was also invited to interview for a sanitary inspection post upon finishing in 1892, but declined the offer, and instead found scope for her interests in researching and preparing reports on various health-related subjects. The first was an unofficial report about women in the fish-curing industry in conjunction with the royal commission on labour, written at the behest of her friend Edith Temple Orme. Ravenhill's developing career in public health was also aided by her friendship with Prince Leopold, whose estate in Wiltshire bordered that of her father, and Princess Christian, who introduced her to many leading social reformers and other public figures of the period. It was through this friendship that Ravenhill served, from 1894 to 1897, as secretary to the Royal British Nurses Association, one of Princess Christian's causes.<br>
<br>Ravenhill resigned this position in 1897 to work as a lecturer in public health law for the Co-operative Society and the Women's Co-operative Guild, beginning a long career in health education. In her first year she gave a series of over forty lectures in various manufacturing areas, after which she took a post under the West Riding county council (1899&#150;1904), teaching a course which she had devised herself for teachers on the correlation of hygiene and health education with ordinary school subjects, and serving as an inspector of hygiene and domestic economy at various technical institutes and evening schools. In 1899 she was secretary of the school hygiene section at the Royal Sanitary Institute's congress at Southampton. The same year she represented the National Health Society at the International Congress of Women at Westminster, where she first met Michael Sadler, head of the special report department of the Board of Education, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship.<br>
<br>It was while attending the congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute in Paris in 1900 that Ravenhill first became interested in American home economics education. The topic had been prominent in the Paris Exhibition of that year, although she noted that the idea of applying science to household matters, and offering the subject at university level, was regarded with great suspicion there. Ravenhill, however, was enthusiastic about the new discipline. She approached Michael Sadler about the need for a report on the American experience; Robert Morant, president of the Board of Education, gave her the commission. Ravenhill approached the Royal Sanitary Institute and the West Riding county council to help fund her trip, agreeing to submit separate reports on school sanitation and on home economics courses in American schools. Her research trip in the summer of 1901 ignited her enthusiasm for establishing a university home economics course in Britain. Arranged by Ellen H. Richards, one of the founders of the American Home Economics Association, Ravenhill's tour took her across the American north-east and midwest and into Canada, bringing her into contact with many prominent social reformers. In New York she attended the Third Lake Placid Conference (1901) of home economics educators, the forerunner of the American Home Economics Association. Ravenhill was so impressed with the American movement that she strongly considered returning to train there herself so that she could be a stronger advocate for the idea in Britain; Sadler dissuaded her, arguing that she could accomplish more by staying in England.<br>
<br>Ravenhill's reports for the Royal Sanitary Institute (1902), which elected her as its first woman fellow in 1904, and for the Board of Education (1905) received much press attention, and as a result Ravenhill was invited to join various committees relating to school hygiene and health. On some of these committees she was the only woman; other women were, as she noted, more involved in the suffrage movement at that time. Although not anti-suffrage by inclination, she had an aversion, in deference to her much admired elder sister Margaret, against being a &#145;platform woman&#146;; and Ravenhill's commitment to promoting the scientific study of social problems outweighed any desire to become involved in suffrage organizations. Her membership on the school hygiene subcommittees of the Royal Sanitary Institute and the British Association had alerted her to the need for more attention to children's formative years and their nutritional requirements, and prompted her to undertake several research projects. Her investigations into the sleep requirements of elementary school children were presented before the International Congress on School Hygiene in London (1907) and published as <span class="italic">Some Characteristics and Requirements of Childhood</span> (1908). In 1906&#150;7 she visited physical training colleges for women in England, Scotland, Denmark, and Sweden, accompanied by the surgeon Dame Mary Scharlieb, after which Ravenhill was sent by the English board of education as a temporary inspector to visit women's training colleges and report on methods of physical exercise. She later declined an offer from Robert Morant to become the second woman inspector of schools. Other studies included an investigation into moral education in elementary schools for a private commission established in 1907 (presided over by Lord Bryce and Michael Sadler) and a report for the Child Study Society on the play interests of elementary school children (1910). She also wrote several school textbooks on domestic and personal hygiene, as well as an edited volume (with Catherine Schiff), <span class="italic">Household Administration: its Place in the Higher Education of Women</span> (1911).<br>
<br>It was in this context of public interest in social welfare issues that Ravenhill became involved in a movement to develop a university course in home economics in Britain, an idea which had gained currency in the aftermath of the report of the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration (1904) and its recommendation that girls should be given better domestic science instruction. A university-level course in &#145;home science&#146; was seen as a way to provide teachers qualified to develop scientifically based domestic courses for secondary school girls, give home-related subjects such as domestic hygiene and food preparation a higher social status, and provide an option for university women wanting to take up positions in social welfare work which were then being opened to women. The idea found fertile ground at King's College for Women, London, where Ravenhill was lecturing in hygiene, among a number of women and men who were interested in the reform of higher education in order to make it more relevant to modern life, including: Lilian M. Faithfull, vice-principal of King's College for Women (1894&#150;1907); her successor, Hilda D. Oakeley; Halford Mackinder, principal of the London School of Economics; Herbert Jackson, professor of organic chemistry at King's College; Sir Arthur Rucker, principal of the University of London (1901&#150;8); and his wife, Thereza, Lady Rucker. Inaugurated in 1908, household and social science was established as a London BSc course in 1920 and led to the founding of King's College of Household and Social Science in 1928.<br>
<br>Ravenhill reluctantly agreed to her younger sister Edith's suggestion in 1910 that they accompany their brother Horace and his son to Canada, a decision which she took with &#145;great pain&#146; as it meant giving up her work in England  (Ravenhill, 170). The sojourn was intended to last only four years, but her return in 1914 was cancelled due to the outbreak of war in Europe, and she was never able to afford the return trip afterwards. Ravenhill at first threw her energies into the homestead at Shawnigan Lake on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and into the local community, but was soon disillusioned by the lack of public-spirited women and the sharp demarcation between the sexes in terms of activities and occupations. Again she found scope for her interests in American home economics education. She held annual visiting lectureships at Oregon State College at Corvallis, and was appointed in 1917 by the Ellen H. Richards Memorial Fund as the first international lecturer in home economics, undertaking a two-month tour through Texas and various midwestern states. She also served as director of home economics at Utah State Agricultural College, Logan, from 1917 to 1919. This she considered in hindsight to be one of the &#145;greatest and costly mistakes&#146; of her life as a result of her experiences with the Mormon social system and a severe case of Spanish influenza which forced her resignation and effectively ended her career as a lecturer  (ibid., 197). None the less her early research on American home economics had earned her great appreciation among the American pioneers, and she was made an honorary doctor of home economics by the American Home Economics Association during their jubilee in 1950.<br>
<br>Having moved to Victoria in 1919, Ravenhill became active in the Women's Institutes movement, and it was through a request to adapt native tribal designs onto hooked rugs that she began a three-year research project on the arts and crafts of native British Columbian tribes, culminating in the publication of <span class="italic">The Native Tribes of British Columbia</span> (1938), a school textbook, and <span class="italic">A Corner Stone of Canadian Culture</span> (1944), a handbook on native designs. For this work, as well as for her establishment of the Society for Native Columbian Indian Arts and Crafts in 1940 to help improve the self-esteem and economic independence of native Canadians, the University of British Columbia awarded her an honorary doctor of science degree in 1948.<br>
<br>Ravenhill never married: an engagement in 1882 to a young doctor was broken off by her parents shortly before the wedding due to a dispute over the settlement. Her younger sister Edith became her lifelong companion and housekeeper. Of average build and slight of figure, Ravenhill had excelled at music and dancing in her youth, but was always of somewhat indifferent health, suffering from a number of serious illnesses throughout her life which required long periods of convalescence and prevented her from pursuing her interests with the vigour she desired. A period of recuperation in Bournemouth following an attack of rheumatic fever in 1887 brought her into the care of a doctor who challenged her religious faith, and, although she never rejected Christianity, she later valued the experience for enabling her to question religious dogma and to weigh carefully the arguments on both sides of a vital question. Despite her achievements and her lifelong desire for knowledge, she always felt keenly the lack of academic training, and ascribed her successes to perseverance, a quick intuition, and self-application. She died in Victoria, British Columbia, on 27 May 1954.<br>
