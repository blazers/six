<span class="headword">Sibbald,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was &#145;a Fyfe gentleman borne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Mr John Lamont</span>, 19), though his parentage is unknown. He recorded that &#145;I have been from my youth a Souldier&#146;  (&#145;Speech&#146;, 200), and probably made his career as a mercenary in the Thirty Years' War. He first appears (with the rank of colonel) as the commander of the covenanter garrison placed in the House of Airlie at the end of June 1640 by the earl of Montrose to prevent it falling into the hands of the earl of Argyll, his rival. About a week later Argyll arrived, removed Sibbald, and destroyed the castle.<br>
<br>Sibbald is next mentioned in August 1644, when he was one of Montrose's two companions when, in disguise, he made his way from England to the highlands. In November 1644 he left Montrose and joined the covenanters, and he has been roundly condemned for this. Montrose's &#145;courtesies and other noble benevolences&#146; had been repaid with ingratitude  (Gordon, 71) by a man who &#145;deserted him in his greatest need&#146;  (Wishart, 50). However, it is possible that his &#145;desertion&#146; was part of some secret plan. Nathaniel Gordon, who also &#145;deserted&#146; at this point, was believed to have been sent to persuade Lord Gordon to leave the covenanters and join Montrose, and Sibbald may have been acting on secret orders for some other covert mission. Certainly Sibbald, like Nathaniel, later returned to serve Montrose and, as the final episode of his life shows, he was fully trusted by him. He probably went into exile with Montrose in 1646, and about the end of 1649 was dispatched with letters from Montrose to royalist leaders. Major-General James Turner travelled with him from Hamburg to Rotterdam, and since Sibbald was short of money gave him a letter to his wife in Edinburgh, telling her to lend him some. She did so, but &#145;he had his head chopt of not long after &hellip; so I losd both my friend and my money&#146;, as Turner briskly relates  (Turner, 92). This shows that Sibbald reached Edinburgh, but he was arrested in Musselburgh, where he was a prisoner by 23 April 1650. After Montrose's attempt at a rising had been defeated and he had been executed, the Scottish parliament turned its attention to Sibbald's fate. Montrose's trust in was indicated by the fact that the letters that Sibbald carried but had not delivered told the recipients to give &#145;absolute crydit&#146; to what he said  (<span class="italic">Historical Works of Balfour</span>, 4.22). Sibbald was an unco-operative prisoner, and on 18 May parliament threatened him with torture unless he satisfied his interrogators. If the report of a French agent is to be trusted, under torture he revealed a royalist plot to seize Edinburgh Castle. After a trial by the committee for processes, parliament gave orders on 4 June that he be beheaded. The sentence was carried out on 7 June at the Mercat Cross, High Street, Edinburgh, Sibbald being beheaded by the Maiden, the Scottish precursor of the guillotine. He had been prevented from reading a speech he had prepared declaring his loyalty to the king and true protestant religion, and by one account he died &#145;verrie obduredlie&#146; (obdurately) in that he refused to accept his guilt  (Nicoll, 15). A royalist account describes, in an idealized vision of a martyr's death, how on the scaffold Sibbald &#145;smil'd a while, and talk'd to the disorderly rabble that was about him: then with such an heroick gesture march'd to the block, as if he had been to act a gallant in a Play&#146;  (Wishart, 270n.).<br>
