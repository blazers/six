<span class="headword">Barenger,  James</span>  (1780&#150;1831), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born on 25 December 1780, the son of James Barenger (1745&#150;1813) of Kentish Town, London, a painter and glazier who exhibited a number of watercolour drawings of insects at the Royal Academy (1793&#150;9). It is likely that Barenger trained under his father; he may also have received instruction from his uncle M. S. Barenger, an engraver, William Woollett (an uncle on his mother's side), and Benjamin Thomas Pouncey, another relative. In 1807, at the age of twenty-seven, Barenger exhibited his first pictures at the Royal Academy: <span class="italic">Sheep from Nature</span> and <span class="italic">Famous Setter</span>, when he gave his address as Kentish Town. By 1812 he had moved to Camden Town.<br>
<br>Barenger gained a reputation as a painter of racehorses, deer, and dogs, as well as sporting scenes. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1807 until his death in 1831 and occasionally showed at the British Institution. Among his numerous patrons was the earl of Derby for whom he painted <span class="italic">Jonathan Griffin, Huntsman to the Earl of Derby's Staghounds</span> (1813; Tate collection), engraved by R. Woodman and published in 1823 under the title of <span class="italic">The Earl of Derby's Staghounds</span> with the names of the principal sitters lettered below. In 1819 Barenger painted for the earl of Derby <span class="italic">Jonathan Griffin, Huntsman of the Earl of Derby's Staghounds, on Spanker</span> (Paul Mellon collection, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, USA), which was also engraved. Other patrons included the duke of Grafton, the marquess of Londonderry, and the bloodstock auctioneer Richard Tattersall (1785&#150;1859). From 1814 Barenger was said to be living near Tattersalls at Hyde Park Corner, and from 1815 onwards all his paintings were shown at Tattersalls. His works were popular with publishers of sporting literature. The eighth volume of <span class="italic">British Field Sports</span>, by William Henry Scott (1818), contains seventeen illustrations of his sporting subjects. Thomas McLean's <span class="italic">The Sporting Repository</span> (1822) includes five plates after Barenger, and <span class="italic">Annals of Sporting by Caleb Quizem, Esq. and his Various Correspondents</span> (1824) reproduces two engravings from his pictures by his uncle S. M. Barenger: <span class="italic">Topthorn, a Celebrated Hunter</span> (1824) and <span class="italic">Marengo, a White Charger</span> (of the horse that belonged to Napoleon).<br>
<br>Barenger's animal paintings included prize cattle such as <span class="italic">Durham Twin Steers</span> engraved by Charles Turner in 1817, and <span class="italic">The Famous Lincolnshire Ox</span> engraved in 1823. In <span class="italic">Evans and Ruffy's Farmers Journal</span> of 1811, Barenger was described as &#145;a well-established sporting and animal painter&#146; and the review of the Smithfield show in 1811 recorded that &#145;Mr. James Barenger the artist exhibited most admirable portraits of a horse and a dog belonging to Mr Westcar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evans and Ruffy's Farmers Journal</span>, 1811). Many of Barenger's works were engraved in a large size, such as the companion prints <span class="italic">Pheasants</span> and <span class="italic">British Feathered Game</span> (each 17&frac12; &times; 14 in.) engraved by Charles Turner and published by Ackermann in 1810. Within the genre of animal painting, Barenger's subject range was wide, encompassing hunt scenes, horses, dogs, cattle, and game birds&#151;one of his best-known works in this last category being a life-size canvas of a cockfight (30 &times; 25 in.). He apparently bred pointers and his portrait <span class="italic">Dol</span>, engraved by John Scott and reproduced in the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> (1826), is said to have been one of his own dogs. His own involvement in the sporting scene clearly contributed to his success as a painter. His paintings are characterized by a precise and accurate rendering of his subjects based on careful observation. Though a stiffness about his animals has been noted, this does not detract from the quality and charm of his work. There are few works by Barenger in British public collections but the Tate collection, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, each holds one of his oil paintings. Barenger died in London on 1 October 1831 and was buried in St Pancras old churchyard.<br>
