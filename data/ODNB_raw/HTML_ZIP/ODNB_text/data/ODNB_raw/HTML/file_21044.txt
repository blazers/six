<span class="headword">Owtram <span class="st"> [Outram]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Robert Owtram and was baptized in Derbyshire either at Barlow, near Chesterfield, on 17 March 1626, or at the adjacent parish of Dronfield six weeks earlier on 5 February. In May 1642 he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated BA in 1645 and proceeded MA in 1649. From 1648 to 1657 he was a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge; in 1655 he was junior proctor of the university. In 1660 he was created DD.<br>
<br>In May 1656 Owtram was presented to the living of Navenby in Lincolnshire, which he held until 1659 when he was appointed to the rectory of St Mary Woolnoth, London. It is likely that he received episcopal ordination during this time, as others like Simon Patrick did, for he continued to hold the living at the Restoration and retained it until 1666. In 1664 he was appointed rector of St Margaret's, Westminster, and in 1670 a prebendary of Westminster Abbey. In July 1669 he was also installed as archdeacon of Leicester. He died on 23 August 1679, and was buried two days later in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to him.<br>
<br>Owtram was a respected churchman, and the nonconformist Richard Baxter had a high regard for him, considering him &#145;understanding, Conscionable &amp; peaceable&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.105). He gained a reputation as a scholar, especially knowledgeable in rabbinic literature. This was demonstrated in his work <span class="italic">De sacrificiis libri duo</span> (1677), which he dedicated to Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby. The book was written to defend the doctrine of atonement against the Socinians, and to refute the idea that Christ's death was merely an example of piety. It is a discussion of Hebrew sacrifices and their meanings, buttressed with patristic and rabbinical references, and concludes with a discussion of Christ's heavenly intercession. An English translation by John Allen was published in 1817.<br>
<br>After Owtram's death Joseph Hindmarsh published six sermons which he alleged were shorthand versions of Owtram's sermons. His friends repudiated their authenticity, claiming that they were &#145;thrust out into the world&#146; only to serve the ends of profit  (<span class="italic">Twenty Sermons</span>, sig. A5<i>r</i>). James Gardiner, later bishop of Lincoln, published some of Owtram's genuine sermons under the title <span class="italic">Twenty Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions</span> in 1682, with a revised edition in 1697. The introduction portrayed Owtram as identifying the danger of three enemies&#151;papists, libertines, and dissenters&#151;and the sermons were commended as &#145;an Antidote very seasonable for the malignity of the Age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Twenty Sermons</span>, 380). The sermons bear out the description. They advocated stability in the nation and obedience to the magistrate, and several took issue with the Roman Catholic church on the use of scripture and on its teaching on the eucharistic presence. Against the dissenters who repudiated the use of a set form of prayers Owtram noted: &#145;All the Protestant Churches of other Nations, and all the Christian Churches in the World, have set forms for their publick Offices, and so hath the whole Church had for fourteen hundred years at least&#146;  (<span class="italic">Twenty Sermons</span>, 137&#150;8). Preaching on <span class="roman">1 John</span> 3: 7 Owtram launched an attack on John Saltmarsh and other antinomians who &#145;own no covenant between God and us, but only between God and Christ. This, say they, Christ hath performed, and so reconciled us unto God without the performance of any condition on our parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Twenty Sermons</span>, 380).<br>
<br>In his will Owtram bequeathed lands in Derbyshire and Lincolnshire to his widow, Jane, and left legacies to his nephews and nieces. Surviving him by forty-two years, his widow died on 4 October 1721 and was buried in Westminster Abbey eight days later. A catalogue of Owtram's library was compiled by William Cooper in 1681.<br>
