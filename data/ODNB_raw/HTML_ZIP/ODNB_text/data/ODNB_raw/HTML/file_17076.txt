<span class="headword">Low,  William</span>  (1814&#150;1886), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 11 December 1814 at Rothesay, Bute, Scotland, the eldest son of John Low, a leather currier, and Mary McKinzie, a labourer's daughter. In 1815 the family moved to Glasgow where William was raised. He was apprenticed to Peter MacQuisten, a Glasgow engineer and surveyor.<br>
<br>In the late 1830s Low was at Bristol working on the construction of the Box Tunnel near Bath for the Great Western Railway, and while there married Elizabeth Cameron (<i>d</i>. 1896) in October 1838. By 1841 Low was an assistant engineer to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, moving to Chester to work on the Chester to Holyhead line. He was also consulted on the Shrewsbury to Hereford, and the Shrewsbury to Chester lines, especially about tunnelling. He probably returned to Glasgow to work in partnership with MacQuisten until the latter's death about 1847. In 1850 Low submitted plans for a loan fund to finance the construction of railways in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1852 Low became joint owner with Mortimer Maurice of the Vron colliery, near Wrexham, and Low set up home at Adwy'r-clawdd near Coed-poeth, moving in 1864 to Roseneath, a house he built himself, in Wrexham. He pursued a career locally, as the managing partner of Vron colliery with about 400 employees, and as a consulting colliery engineer. He advocated the Vale of Llangollen Railway, which opened in 1858; subscribed to Wrexham Infirmary; served as a Denbighshire JP; and was an active supporter of the local Liberal Party. In 1875 Low built the Westminster Buildings in Wrexham for the Great Exhibition of Industry and Art in 1876.<br>
<br>Low maintained professional interests at the national level, and was especially known for his advocacy of the channel tunnel. In the 1860s he worked with Sir John Hawkshaw on plans for a tunnel, but disagreed with Hawkshaw's proposals for a single-bore tunnel with a double-track railway, arguing that a twin-bore tunnel with a single track in each would be cheaper to construct and could be better ventilated. His suggestions are considered to be the first practical proposals for a channel tunnel, and the present tunnel was constructed on similar principles. He and a colleague, George Thomas, submitted plans to Napoleon III in 1867, and Low played an important role in subsequent Anglo-French investigations and reports in favour of the scheme.<br>
<br>The Franco-Prussian War interrupted these discussions, but afterwards interest arose once more, and in England two competing private companies emerged, one backing Hawkshaw's proposals, while that of the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin backed those of Low. Both companies obtained enabling legislation, both sank trial shafts, and drove short stretches of tunnel, but the idea aroused opposition, and in 1883 British military authorities vetoed construction on the grounds of national security. All work on both sides of the channel came to a halt. Such was Low's enthusiasm that his study at Roseneath became known as the Channel Tunnel Office, and it may have been a reason for his move to London in 1882.<br>
<br>In 1867 Low was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1871 he and Thomas submitted plans for a railway from England to India, Low having surveyed part of the route in 1870, and in 1876 he advocated a line from Constantinople to Karachi. In the mid-1870s Low advocated a tunnel under the Mersey, and a bridge over the Severn, both of which were authorized but remained unbuilt. Some years before his death an attack of paralysis compelled him to cease active work, and his colliery may have closed down during the 1878&#150;9 trade depression. In 1882 Low moved from Wrexham to 88 West Cromwell Road, London. He died there on 10 July 1886 and was buried at Brompton cemetery on 13 July. His widow lived in Oswestry until her death in 1896. The 1861 census records ten children.<br>
