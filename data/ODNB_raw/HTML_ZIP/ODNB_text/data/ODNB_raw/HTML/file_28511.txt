<span class="headword">Walker,  Sayer</span>  (1748&#150;1826), <span class="occ">physician</span>, whose family came from Bocking, Essex, was born in London. About 1763 he attended the Mile End dissenting academy and in 1770 became assistant minister in Bocking under the Revd T. Davidson. While at Bocking he became friendly with his future father-in-law, Joseph Savill, a wealthy cloth maker who arranged for the collection of rents for property in Essex that belonged to Guy's Hospital. Walker then became acquainted with William Saunders of Guy's Hospital. On 5 November 1772 Walker married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of Joseph Savill; they had at least one child. From this year until 1777 Walker was assistant minister in charge at Castle Green church, Bristol. After his wife inherited money from an aunt and received a cash gift from her father, Walker was able to spend two years studying medicine. In 1779 he attended lectures on materia medica given by William Saunders at Guy's before studying possibly at Montpellier, and certainly at Edinburgh. Later that year he became Presbyterian minister at the Baker Street mission in Enfield, where he treated his poor parishioners. He held this post until 1792. On new year's day 1790 Walker preached a sermon in London in which he praised scientific education, spoke of the progress being made in the treatment of the insane, and supported the French revolutionaries' attack on tyranny and stagnation.<br>
<br>Walker received his MD from Aberdeen on 31 December 1791 and on 25 June 1792 became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He resigned from the ministry in this year, possibly as a result of his asthma. He was elected physician to the London Lying-in Hospital in June 1794, where J. C. Lettsom was a colleague. Walker later became treasurer and orator of the Medical Society of London. He published <span class="italic">The Importance of Religious Instruction</span> (1790), <span class="italic">A Treatise on Nervous Diseases</span> (1796), and <span class="italic">Observations on the Constitution of Women</span> (1803). In 1826 Walker's asthma forced him to move to Clifton, Bristol, where he died on 9 November 1826.<br>
<br>About a year later Walker's body was exhumed and buried in Bunhill Fields, London, in the tomb of the Revd John Owen (1616&#150;1683), dean of Christ Church, vice-chancellor of Oxford University, and friend of John Sayer (1633&#150;1686), after whom Walker had been named.<br>
