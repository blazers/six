<span class="headword">Stanley,  William George Richard</span>, ninth earl of Derby  (1655&#150;1702), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born in March 1655, the third of nine sons and five daughters of Charles Stanley, eighth earl of Derby (1628&#150;1672), and his wife, Dorothea Helena de Rupa (<i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of Jan van der Kerchhove, lord of Heenvlies, Zeeland, and maid of honour to Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia. The Stanleys were royalists: William's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26274/', "James Stanley")</script>, the &#145;martyr earl of Derby&#146;, was executed after the battle of Worcester, and his father, the eighth earl, was imprisoned in the Tower after he joined Sir George Booth in the unsuccessful 1659 Cheshire rising. After the Restoration the eighth earl worked to recover the family's sequestered estates and restore the Stanleys' historical authority and political position in the north-west. He was partially successful, regaining his family's control of the government of the Isle of Man and the lord lieutenancies of Lancashire and Cheshire, but failed to recover all the family estates. William, after his father's death on 21 December 1672, continued throughout his life to press his family's legal claims to their former estates.<br>
<br>Stanley was only seventeen when he became the ninth earl of Derby, and some six months later, on 10 July 1673, he married Lady Elizabeth (1660&#150;1717), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4210/', "Thomas Butler, earl of Ossory")</script>, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4191/', "James Butler, first duke of Ormond")</script>. They had one son and two surviving daughters. Ormond served as Derby's guardian for the rest of his minority, and immediately after the marriage the duchess of Ormond described him as &#145;well natured&#146;. Opinions were soon less favourable, however. In August 1673 Ormond sent Derby on the customary grand tour. He travelled through France and Italy before returning to England about July 1675. Thomas Fairfax, Derby's companion and tutor during the tour, complained of him:<blockquote>I must confess I think it very necessary for him to be there [Paris] to learn something which hitherto we have made but a slender progress in. I hope we may persuade him to do something of reason till he comes to be of age; but what may happen after, God knows. (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.366)</blockquote>Derby's father-in-law Ossory later described him as ill-natured and obstinate, and accused him of brutality to his daughter.<br>
<br>In religion Derby was, according to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Roger Kenyon, committed to the Church of England and steered a middle course, for the &#145;high flyers of either side find no hearty entertainment with him!&#146;  (Bagley, 116). In May 1676 Derby succeeded to his father's former offices of lord lieutenant for Cheshire and Lancashire, and in 1682, as lord lieutenant, he signed an address to the king which emphasized the significance of the Church of England as the &#145;true Protestant Church&#146;.<br>
<br>Derby took part in the debates in the House of Lords on the three bills for excluding the Roman Catholic duke of York from the succession. He was, however, undoubtedly well aware that there was strong support for the exclusion bills in the north-west and, consistent with his later political approach, kept a somewhat ambiguous course during this political crisis. Ormond noted that Derby &#145;did not side with the better party (those opposing exclusions)&#146;  (Coward, 148). In 1682 James, duke of Monmouth, the king's illegitimate son, arranged for a tour of the north-west. As lord lieutenant, Derby was in a dilemma during Monmouth's &#145;progress&#146;. He could not ignore the various spectacles that had been arranged, but he did not want to be grouped among those who advocated that Charles II should make Monmouth his heir. As a result, he attended the Wallasey races, but tried not to interact with Monmouth. The government's informers grumbled over Derby's ambiguous conduct, reporting that he had bought a tent to entertain Monmouth at the races but did not arrive until after dinner, and then &#145;did not go to his Grace, but his grace rode up to him and they only civilly saluted each other&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>).<br>
<br>After the Rye House plot in 1683, Derby, joined by the local tories, sent Charles II an address offering him congratulations for having avoided the danger but treating somewhat cautiously the exclusion question. In the same year Derby encouraged a demonstration of the tory gentry in Delamer Forest, to counter whig demonstrations. He was rewarded with inclusion in the new list of aldermen for Chester after the borough voluntarily surrendered and was regranted its charter.<br>
<br>In preparation for James's first parliament in 1685, Derby reported to the secretary of state that he was very &#145;diligent in employing my interest for the election of good members&#146; to the Commons for both Cheshire and Lancashire  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1685</i>). His efforts were successful, and tory candidates were elected for the most part. When he learned of Monmouth's rebellion, Derby worked to keep the peace in Cheshire and Lancashire. He raised troops for the king who described themselves as &#145;true sons of the Church of England&#146; opposed to this &#145;horrid rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 181). Acting under the government's direction, Derby arrested the prominent whig Henry Booth, second Baron Delamer. Later acquitted of treason, Delamer remained Derby's political rival for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Despite Derby's support of the king, he was replaced as lord lieutenant in Cheshire and Lancashire by Roman Catholic appointees, and also lost his positions as <i>custos rotulorum</i> and JP for Lancashire. Realizing that his policies were causing turmoil, James II summoned Derby to London in mid-October 1688 and told him he would be restored to the lord lieutenancies. Derby's wife reported to him, &#145;Last night I saw the King in the draweing room. He came and told me you had offered your service, whch he took very kindly, and thanked you for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 197). Derby apparently agreed to accept the return of his offices &#145;to gain and preserve a power to secure the quiet of those counties, and having raised the militia, who were eager to follow him, he might raise, upon occasion, those and the more northerne counties&#146;. He again met with the king, reminding him that he &#145;was a Stanley, that his ancestors were ever loyal&#146;  (ibid., 199).<br>
<br>It appears that Derby initially believed the king's concessions had decreased the chance of an invasion by the prince of Orange, but none the less he cautiously kept his options open and met with peers belonging to the &#145;Cockpit circle&#146;, individuals associated with William, prince of Orange, and Princess Anne. At some point he decided to take further action and met his former antagonist Lord Delamer, an ally of the prince of Orange, on 1 November for &#145;some time in secret discourse&#146;. According to Roger Kenyon, &#145;my lord Delamer declared his great satisfaction with that meeting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 200). Their secret agreement quickly unravelled when, after William's landing, Delamer openly declared both his and Derby's support. Derby then refused to join Delamer and complained that Delamer's disclosure had been premature. Even Derby's claims that he tried to mitigate the chance of any open conflict by secretly negotiating with the governor of Chester Castle and ordering the militia to the castle appear to have been largely illusory. He took no action to prevent fresh forces from moving into Chester, and the garrison did not disarm until after James's flight.<br>
<br>Only after William entered London did Derby proclaim his support. Delamer denounced Derby for not keeping his word and railed against him that &#145;your Lordship must think you cannot be esteemed by the Prince, or those with him as a man that has given any assistance to the cause, and I believe the nation will have the same opinion of you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 206). Derby did attend the Convention Parliament but again pursued a cautious course. Consequently, while his wife, a close friend of Mary, was given precedence as the new queen's groomess of the stole, Derby himself was not given any national office. Delamer, however, was appointed lord lieutenant of Cheshire, which so upset Derby that he refused the appointment for Lancashire. Derby's friends petitioned the king, but William held firm in his appointment of Delamer.<br>
<br>Derby struggled without any official position at court in William's reign. In 1691 he took brief residence on the Isle of Man, appointing Roger Kenyon as governor. He skirmished with the commissioner of the customs, asserting that the king's rights there were limited, and he sought to improve the economy of the island, obtaining permission to issue some currency and taking steps to promote the manufacture of linen. In 1694 Delamer died and Derby tried unsuccessfully to regain his lord lieutenancies. His promotion of tory candidates for the Commons had only limited success. Kenyon noted that during this period &#145;my lord is uneasy under his disappointment, and quarrelsome with everyone that is concerned with him&#146;  (Bagley, 124).<br>
<br>When Queen Anne succeeded in 1702, Derby was at last restored to both lieutenancies and his office of <i>custos rotulorum</i>. He was also made lord lieutenant of north Wales. His renewed service, however, was short-lived. He died on 5 November 1702, and was buried at Ormskirk in Lancashire. His wife, Elizabeth, died on 5 July 1717, and was buried at Westminster Abbey on 12 July. Derby's only son having predeceased him, the earldom passed to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66592/', "James Stanley")</script>.<br>
