<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>  (1791&#150;1863), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at Edinburgh in October or November 1791. He was articled in 1804 to the engraver Robert Scott, and had as his fellow pupil John Burnet, from whom he received much assistance; he also studied drawing in the Trustees' Academy and began to produce large steel historical and figure plates. Stewart's first independent plate was from Sir William Allan's <span class="italic">Tartar Robbers Dividing the Spoil</span>, which was followed by <span class="italic">Circassian Captives</span> (1820), <span class="italic">The Murder of Archbishop Sharpe</span> (1824), and <span class="italic">Queen Mary Signing her Abdication</span>, all from paintings by Allan. He then became associated with David Wilkie, for whom he executed a number of works, including an admirable plate of <span class="italic">The Penny Wedding</span>. A founder member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1826, he joined the Artist's Annuity Fund in 1812 and was still a member in 1843. In 1830 Stewart moved with his family to London, where he worked for various book publishers. He also engraved <span class="italic">The Pedlar</span>, after Wilkie, and <span class="italic">Hide and Seek</span>, from his own picture painted in the style of Wilkie, which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1829. His minor works, including book illustrations, date from 1830 to 1833, and are quite rare, an example being <span class="italic">The Legacy</span>, after James Inskipp, for <span class="italic">The Amulet</span> (1831).<br>
<br>In 1833 Stewart was induced by financial embarrassment to abandon his profession and emigrate to Cape Colony. There he settled as a farmer, but within a year he was ruined by the outbreak of war. He then moved to the town of Somerset, where, by teaching and portrait painting, he earned the means of purchasing another property. He later became a magistrate and a member of the colonial legislature. He died in the Cape in May 1863.<br>
