<span class="headword">Watson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, may have served as a midshipman with Edward Vernon, though it is also possible that he entered the navy from the merchant service. In any event he became first lieutenant of the <i>Antelope</i> in 1733, and rose to become her captain on 7 October 1737.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1739 Watson was appointed to the <i>Burford</i> as Vernon's flag-captain, and he acted in that capacity at the reduction of Porto Bello. He moved with Vernon to the <i>Princess Caroline</i> in January 1741, was flag-captain during the abortive attack on Cartagena, and in June 1741 moved again with Vernon to the <i>Boyne</i>, in which he returned to England in December 1742. In September 1743 he was appointed to the <i>Northumberland</i> (70 guns), which in the following spring was one of the fleet sent to Lisbon under the command of Sir Charles Hardy the elder. On the homeward voyage at daybreak on 8 May the <i>Northumberland</i>, looking out ahead, was ordered by signal to chase a strange sail seen to the northward. She did not come up with it, and did not obey her recall, which was made about two o'clock. The weather deteriorated and she lost sight of the fleet, then of the chase; but about four o'clock she sighted three ships to the leeward, the wind being westerly. The <i>Northumberland</i> ran down towards these strangers. They lay-to to wait for her; it was seen that they were French, two of 64 guns and the third a frigate of 26 guns. One of the 64-gun ships, the <i>Content</i>, was about a mile to windward of her consort, the <i>Mars</i>. Had Watson engaged her, he might possibly have disabled her before the <i>Mars</i> could come to her support. It was probably Watson's best option, if he refused to accept the advice offered by the master and endeavour to lead the Frenchmen back to Hardy's fleet.<br>
<br>But Watson was in no mood to follow advice which smacked of caution. It was said that his skull had been fractured in a fall, &#145;and a small matter of liquor rendered him quite out of order&#151;which was his unhappy fate that day&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True and Authentick Narrative of the Action between the Northumberland and Three French Men of War</span>, 7). According to the anonymous author of the account,<blockquote>We bore down on them so precipitately that our small sails were not stowed nor top-gallant sails furled before the enemy began to fire on us, and at the same time had the cabins to clear away; the hammocks were not stowed as they should be; in short, we had nothing in order as we should before action. (ibid., 3)</blockquote>About five o'clock the <i>Northumberland</i> closed with the <i>Content</i> and received her fire, but, without replying to it, ran down to the <i>Mars</i>. The <i>Content</i> followed, as did the frigate. The <i>Northumberland</i> was a target for the three of them. The men at the wheel were killed, and nobody thought of sending others to take their place. Watson was wounded, and before the first lieutenant could get on deck, the master struck the colours, and the ship was captured. Watson died in France on 4 June 1744. By his will, dated 8 May 1744&#151;the day of the <i>Northumberland</i>'s fateful battle&#151;Watson left all his possessions to his uncle Captain John Roberts, of Reading, who himself died early in the following year. The master, tried by court martial on 1 February 1745, was sentenced to imprisonment in the Marshalsea for life; he was spared capital punishment on the ground that he had given good advice to his captain before the action.<br>
