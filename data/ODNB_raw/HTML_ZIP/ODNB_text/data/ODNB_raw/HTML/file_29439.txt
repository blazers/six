<span class="headword">Willehad</span> <span class="st"> [St Willehad]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 789), <span class="occ">missionary and bishop of Bremen</span>, was one of a number of Anglo-Saxons to embark on missionary work in north-western Europe in the eighth century. His life, written probably in the ninth century (though perhaps not, as sometimes claimed, by Anskar, archbishop of Hamburg&#150;Bremen), states that he came from Northumbria, and this is likely to be correct. A letter of 789 from Alcuin (<i>d</i>. 804) to an unnamed abbot, conveying warm greetings to Willehad, suggests that the two may have been educated together at the episcopal school at York.<br>
<br>At a date in the late 760s (modern historians variously give <i>c</i>.766 and <i>c</i>.770), Willehad was formally sent, at his own behest, to missionize in Frisia by Alhred, king of the Northumbrians. According to his life, he went immediately to Dokkum, the site of the martyrdom of Boniface in 754. The area of his mission covered the east of the Frisian lands, extending as far south and west as Utrecht.<br>
<br>In 780 Charlemagne sent Willehad to preach in the land of the Saxons, between the lower Weser and the lower Elbe. The Frankish king's overlordship was recognized by the still-pagan Saxons only intermittently, the region being conquered finally only in 803&#150;4, after thirty years of periodic warfare. His life credits Willehad's mission with some success, but in 782 a revolt against the Franks by the Saxon duke Widukind forced him to flee the area. He made a pilgrimage to Rome and, on his return, resided at the monastery of Echternach, then governed by the Anglo-Saxon Beornred, where his life tells that he occupied himself by making a copy of the epistles of St Paul.<br>
<br>Willehad resumed his work among the Saxons after Widukind had submitted to Charlemagne and accepted Christianity in 785. In 787, on Charlemagne's orders, he was consecrated at Worms to a new diocese based at Bremen. Willehad consecrated the first cathedral there, built of wood and dedicated to St Peter, in 789, but fell ill and died shortly afterwards, apparently on 8 November, his feast day, at Blexen in Lower Saxony. He was buried in his new church. In 860 Anskar, the archbishop of Hamburg&#150;Bremen (the two bishoprics had been united as an archdiocese in 845), elevated Willehad's relics to the new cathedral. This may have been the occasion for the writing of his life. His cult was never an important one, but at least eighteen churches, from northern Jutland to Lower Saxony, are dedicated to him.<br>
