<span class="headword">Thompson,  Gertrude  Caton-</span>  (1888&#150;1985), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born in London on 1 February 1888, the younger child and only daughter of William Caton Thompson, of Lancashire&#150;Yorkshire stock, and his wife, Ethel Gertrude, daughter of William Bousfield Page, surgeon, of Carlisle. Her father, a barrister and head of the legal branch of the London and North Western Railway, died when she was five years old. Her mother remarried in 1900; her new husband was George Moore, a general practitioner of Maidenhead who was a widower with four sons and a daughter. Her father had ensured her financial independence and, after being educated privately and at the Links School, Eastbourne, until the First World War she enjoyed a social life in London and the country, and included one auspicious visit to Egypt among her travels abroad.<br>
<br>In 1917 Caton-Thompson was employed by the Ministry of Shipping and promoted to a senior secretarial post in which she attended the Paris peace conference. She declined a permanent appointment in the civil service, and in 1921, aged thirty-three and with none of the usual qualifications, she began her archaeological studies under the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie at University College, London, joining his excavations at Abydos in Upper Egypt that winter. The next year was spent at Newnham College, Cambridge (with which she remained associated for the rest of her life), and in attending university courses. She returned to Egypt in 1924 and joined Petrie and Guy Brunton at Qau el Kibir. While they concentrated their excavations on predynastic cemeteries she had concluded, well ahead of her time, that settlement sites would be more informative, and in characteristically independent fashion she embarked on her own excavations on the site of a predynastic village at Hamamiyyah. There she made the first discovery of remains, well stratified, of the very early Badarian civilization. With Guy Brunton she wrote <span class="italic">The Badarian Civilization</span> (1928).<br>
<br>In 1925 Caton-Thompson turned to north-western Egypt and the desert margins of Lake El Faiy&ucirc;m, accompanied by the Oxford geologist Elinor Gardner, to assist in an attempt to correlate lake levels with archaeological stratification. In three El Faiy&ucirc;m seasons they discovered two unknown neolithic cultures which proved later to be related to the Khartoum neolithic. They published their findings in <span class="italic">The Desert Fayum</span> (1934). Her next assignment followed an invitation in 1929 from the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the great monumental ruins at Zimbabwe in southern Africa. She confirmed the conclusion reached by David Randall-MacIver in 1905 that they belonged to an indigenous African culture and were not, as widely believed, of oriental origin. She was also able to date the ruins back to the eighth or ninth century <span class="smallcap">AD</span> and to produce evidence of Zimbabwe's links with Indian Ocean trade.<br>
<br>Having completed her Zimbabwe report with her usual speed (<span class="italic">The Zimbabwe Culture</span>, 1931) Caton-Thompson embarked in 1930, with Elinor Gardner, on an extended campaign of excavations on prehistoric sites at Kharga oasis. These excavations, the first on Saharan oasis sites, inaugurated a far-ranging programme of research on the palaeolithic of north Africa and led to her book <span class="italic">Kharga Oasis in Pre-History</span> (1952).<br>
<br>Caton-Thompson's last excavations, in 1937, were the only ones outside Africa apart from some fieldwork in Malta in her student days. These were at al-Huraydah in the Hadhramaut, southern Arabia, where she excavated the Moon Temple and tombs of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. Carried out in a region then rarely visited by Western, let alone female, travellers, they were the first scientific excavations in southern Arabia. Again she was accompanied by Elinor Gardner. A third, less compatible, member of the party was the writer and traveller Freya Stark. <span class="italic">The Tombs and Moon Temple of Hureidha, Hadramaut</span> appeared in 1944.<br>
<br>Caton-Thompson retired from fieldwork after the Second World War and from her home in Cambridge pursued her research activities and visited excavations in east Africa. She never sought or accepted a professorship. In 1961, already in her seventies, she became a founder member of the British School of History and Archaeology in East Africa (later the British Institute in Eastern Africa), served on its council for ten years, and was later elected an honorary member. An honorary fellowship of Newnham College, Cambridge, and an honorary LittD (1954) of that university were among academic honours bestowed on her. She was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1944 and not long before her death a fellow of University College, London.<br>
<br>Professionally Gertrude Caton-Thompson was a formidable personality, a trenchant critic, adamant in academic argument, and an indefatigable worker. She was an intrepid traveller and at Abydos, it is said, slept in an emptied tomb with cobras for company and a pistol under her pillow to ward off prowling hyenas. Although by nature quiet and retiring, she was excellent company and her dry humour and laconic, incisive comments on people and events became a rich source of anecdote in Cambridge circles. She was a generous benefactor, especially of the National Trust for the purchase of land near where she lived, Court Farm, Broadway, Worcestershire; a home happily shared with two former Cambridge colleagues, the De Navarros, for thirty years. She died there on 18 April 1985. She was unmarried.<br>
