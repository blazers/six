<span class="headword">Pine, Sir  Benjamin Chilley Campbell</span>  (1809&#150;1891), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, the son of Benjamin Chilley Pine of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was born in London and attended school at Brighton. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1833, MA 1840), was admitted to Gray's Inn on 9 June 1831, and was called to the bar in 1841. In the same year he became queen's advocate at Sierra Leone, and made his first marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of John Campbell, who died only six years later, in 1847.<br>
<br>In 1848 Pine acted as governor of Sierra Leone, where he displayed military ability, taking part in the expedition to the Sherbro River, and helping to destroy a strong stockaded fort, from which a group of Africans had terrorized neighbouring settlements. In 1849 his vigorous policy put an end to civil war in the same district.<br>
<br>This success led to Pine's appointment in 1849 as second governor of the infant colony of Natal. During the Cape Frontier War of 1850&#150;53 in the south-west he preserved peace within his territory, and was commended by the home government. In 1855 he led a force of volunteers against the Bhaca, who were subjugated, and also dealt with Boer land claims in Natal and with the labour question.<br>
<br>In 1856 Pine returned to the west coast as governor of the Gold Coast Colony, and was knighted at Windsor Castle. In May 1859, to improve his health, he went to St Kitts, West Indies, where the climate was more congenial, as lieutenant-governor. In the same year he made a second marriage, to Margaretta Anne, daughter of Colonel John Simpson of the Bengal army.<br>
<br>At the time of Pine's appointment, St Kitts, like each of the Leeward Islands, was in effect governed as a separate colony in a loose confederation, with a governor-in-chief at Antigua. Pine recommended a federation, with a central authority based at Antigua. In 1866, while temporarily acting as governor of Antigua, he helped to persuade the legislature to reform the constitution. He did the same in his own island of St Kitts. The home government adopted his views, and in February 1869 he was appointed governor-in-chief of the Leeward Islands, with a mandate to introduce federation (in 1868 he had been appointed governor of Western Australia, but had not acted, because of his appointment to the Leeward Islands). On 23 June 1870, in an exhaustive address, he laid his project before the council of Antigua, and in the course of the year carried it in all the islands. He was thus the first governor under the federal constitution of the Leeward Islands. For his services he was made a KCMG in June 1871.<br>
<br>In 1873, before he had finished his term as governor-in-chief at Antigua, Pine was sent back to Natal as lieutenant-governor. He was recalled in 1874, after the summary trial and banishment of Langalibalele, and retired on a pension in 1875.<br>
<br>Pine was made a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1880, and acted as its treasurer in 1885. He was also a member of the Oriental Club, Hanover Square. A rhetorical speaker and writer, Pine was the author of articles on the African colonies for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He died on 25 February 1891 at his residence at 59 Wimpole Street, London.<br>
