<span class="headword">White,  James</span>  (1877&#150;1927), <span class="occ">property developer and speculator</span>, was born on 17 May 1877 at 16A Sun Place, Rochdale, the son of Thomas White, bricklayer, and his wife, Catherine Mullroy. He was educated at St John's Roman Catholic School, Rochdale. At the age of ten he began working half-time in a cotton mill, and at nineteen he allegedly bought a Rochdale circus, disposing of it after two years for a theatre in Matlock. In 1899, at the age of twenty-one, he married Annie Fetton, a woollen operative, daughter of Edward Fetton, a bricklayer. White also described himself as a bricklayer at this time. In 1900 he emigrated to become a navvy on the South African railways, but was home within a year. He became a speculative builder and later an estate agent and mortgage broker; in 1908 he went bankrupt, but eventually repaid his creditors in full. It is not known when his wife Annie died, but White appears to have married a second wife, Doris, with whom he had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Having moved to London, White gained notoriety when in 1911 a boxing match he had organized at Earls Court was banned by the authorities, fearful of disorder as one of the contestants was black. This and other boxing promotions brought White to the attention of the business community. White possessed the kind of charisma that disarmed critics. With deep-blue eyes, an engaging smile, and a Lancastrian breeziness, he impressed those willing to fall under his spell. All sorts of people, from politicians and newspaper proprietors to sporting types, passed through his office in the Grand Hotel, Trafalgar Square, or repaid his hospitality after work with useful commercial information.<br>
<br>An early client was the pill magnate Sir Joseph Beecham. In 1914 White persuaded him to underwrite the purchase of the Covent Garden estate and market in London. Beecham had to bear the entire financial responsibility when the First World War broke out in 1914 and public share issues for non-essential purposes were prohibited. In the autumn of 1916 White produced an interim arrangement, which collapsed when Beecham died suddenly before its signature. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham was the dead man's elder son, and he became directly involved in the affair. Beecham later recalled that White was bold and dashing in the opening moves of a financial venture, but liable to panic when things started to go wrong. White lacked the tenacity to see through the problems of the Beecham estate to a successful resolution, and it led to a complex chancery case. Others, notably the financier Philip Ernest Hill, finally untangled the estate. However, White remained chairman of the Beecham Trust Ltd, a private Beecham family estate company; and he continued to benefit from his association with the family name.<br>
<br>White was acquainted with Sir Arthur Du Cros, the managing director of the Dunlop Rubber Company, and in 1913 he was appointed the company's financial adviser. Having obtained control of the firm, he subsequently attempted to establish a manufacturing subsidiary in the United States and to extend some affiliates at home. Both projects disintegrated when the post-war recession began in 1920; later White narrowly avoided being sued for his financial miscalculations in Dunlop. His bids to exploit the short-lived cotton boom in Lancashire after 1918 failed to benefit the industry.<br>
<br>White was more successful with his property deals. He bought, for rapid resale, a large urban site in Shaftesbury in Dorset, and prime sites in London's Strand, Bloomsbury, and St Martin's-le-Grand, as well as Selfridge's store in Oxford Street. He also bought a controlling interest in Daly's Theatre, Soho, but had to lease it out after a succession of flops. White sank much money in racing, from his stables at Foxhill, Wanborough, near Swindon, and had some successful horses, especially those ridden by Stephen Donoghue. However, he failed to win admission to the royal enclosure at Ascot.<br>
<br>In 1927 White began to purchase the shares of British Controlled Oilfields, planning to unload them in the United States at a handsome profit. Unfortunately, on the stock exchange's account day, he lacked a considerable sum to pay for shares he was committed to buy. To compound his problems, he was expected within days to find &pound;300,000 for the Wembley exhibition centre, which he was also purchasing. His balance of mind disturbed, no doubt because of these financial embarrassments, White poisoned himself with prussic acid and chloroform at his home, King Edward's Place, Foxhill, Wanborough, on 29 June 1927. He was buried in Wanborough churchyard on 4 July.<br>
<br>White's life was, it was said, &#145;a glorious speculation, his death the gambler's price of failure&#146;  (Meredith, 296). To Sir Thomas Beecham he seemed to be &#145;one of the group of financial wizards who appeared and vanished like comets in the sky of the business world during the period&#146;  (Beecham, 197). Friends from every walk of life regretted his passing. Yet White's recklessness blighted the lives of many, including his wife, Doris, and their son and daughters, about whom nothing further is publicly known.<br>
