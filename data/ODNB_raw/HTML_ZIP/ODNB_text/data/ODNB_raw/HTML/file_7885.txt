<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  George, of Pittendriech</span>  (1490?&#150;1552), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of George Douglas, master of Angus (<i>c</i>.1469&#150;1513), who was killed at Flodden, and his wife, Elizabeth Drummond. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7866/', "Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus")</script>, was his elder brother. George's early years are obscure, but he emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the confusion which followed the killing in 1517 of Antoine de la Bastie, the principal agent of the duke of Albany. Although Douglas's involvement in the crime could not be proven, he was bustled off to France after incarcerations in Blackness and Inchgarvy. Throughout his life he collaborated with his elder brother, in a partnership in which Angus (while clearly not stupid) provided the brawn, George the brains. And there is no doubting the latter's intelligence and wide-ranging adventurousness. Behind his inveterate evasiveness a lively mind can always be seen at work. Few of his ingenious schemes saw fruition, but they all required considered replies from the English privy council, the council of the north, and even the king.<br>
<br>George Douglas aimed to secure independence in life and eventually achieved a fair measure of success. He had become a laird by about 1516 through his marriage to Elizabeth, heir to David Douglas of Pittendriech, whose lands lay near Elgin; they had two sons, David, who became seventh earl of Angus, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7893/', "James Douglas, later earl of Morton")</script> and regent of Scotland in the 1570s. Pittendriech also had an illegitimate son, George of Parkhead, and four illegitimate daughters. Marriage to an heiress brought wealth, and he transformed Dalkeith Castle into something of a palace (in March 1543 Cardinal David Beaton was imprisoned there). Because Angus had no male children, George Douglas was styled master of Angus as his brother's heir presumptive. He was indeed very much Angus's man, acting for him on numerous occasions; rarely did their ambitions clash, and much of Pittendriech's story is the biography of Angus as well. He had been knighted by 3 October 1524, when he was described as &#145;a man of more knowledge and experience than the Earl&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 4, pt 1, no. 701). Master of the royal household from 1526, he shared power with Angus during the latter's ascendancy (1525&#150;8), and when James V took control went into exile with the earl in England, where he remained from 1529 to 1543. Having been forfeited in 1528, Sir George was several times involved in efforts to recover his family's lost position. In 1532 and again in 1542 he took part in English raids into Scotland, and he seems to have maintained spies in Scotland throughout his years in exile.<br>
<br>Following the death of James V on 14 December 1542&#151;for which his dispatch is a vivid if uncertainly reliable source&#151;Douglas returned to Scotland with Angus early in 1543; not everyone was pleased to see them, but eventually the two men recovered their estates and positions. Douglas was quick to profit from his return, by marrying his son James to the youngest daughter of the third earl of Morton in 1543, with a settlement securing the earldom of Morton for them. The exiled Douglases came back with English encouragement and ostensibly at least they were committed to the furtherance of Henry VIII's plans for Anglo-Scottish union. Sir George also seems to have become a committed protestant. Thereafter he was seldom out of the records and featured in the English ones almost as frequently as his apparently much more powerful brother.<br>
<br>Pittendriech owed his prominence to qualities peculiarly suited to the confused political position prevailing in Scotland in the early 1540s&#151;abounding energy, a wide-ranging intelligence, and an almost pathological deviousness. He had an uncanny memory for faces and for gossip; he knew everyone that mattered and most of their secrets. He was also unusually sensitive to geographical factors; thus his outlined schemes for invasion routes for English armies were infinitely detailed and quite accurate. Moreover he had great personal charm and was a negotiator of high skill. This took a number of forms, not least his manipulation of the rather guileless English ambassador Sir Ralph Sadler and a mastery of the art of telling people what they wanted to hear. In spring 1543 Scottish ambassadors were dispatched to London to conclude what became the treaties of Greenwich: the betrothal of Queen Mary and Prince Edward. When the envoys needed stiffening, it was Pittendriech (along with the earl of Glencairn) who was sent early in May, in part because he had become familiar with Henry VIII, in part because he was avowedly in favour of the marriage, but also because of his reputation as a canny and forceful diplomat. In this he was largely successful: the resulting treaty secured much of what the Scots wanted.<br>
<br>At this time Pittendriech and his brother appeared to be staunch &#145;Englishmen&#146;. Early in January 1544 they were captured by the governor, the second earl of Arran, and Cardinal Beaton, and were reported to be in danger of execution. When he was released from Blackness in May by the earl of Hertford, then leading an army of invasion, Douglas told him that &#145;bothe his brother and he shuld have loste their heddes, and the daye prefixed for the same&#146;  (Bain, 2.372). But although he maintained an overtly Anglophile stance, at least to the extent of being free with his advice, doubts soon arose as to his trustworthiness. By December 1544 Henry VIII's agents were complaining how &#145;thErle of Anguishe and George Douglas have nowe opened their untrew, false and disloyall hartes&#146;  (ibid., 2.525&#150;6), and soon after Henry himself ordered that the two men be captured and offered 1000 marks to whoever should bring Douglas in. So complete was his rapprochement with Beaton that on 18 March 1545 it was reported that &#145;the Cardinall and George Dowglas rulith the realme of Scotland this tyme as they thynk good&#146;  (ibid., 2.583). Pittendriech and Angus had recently both fought in the victorious Scottish army at Ancrum Moor on 27 February, while by the beginning of 1546 each was receiving a French pension. Sir George's position survived the murder of Beaton on 29 May 1546 and he continued to be the target for English detestation and distrust, only just escaping when Dalkeith Castle was captured on 3 June 1548. A member of the Scottish council at that time, he took part in Mary of Guise's visit to France in October 1550. In 1552 he accompanied Arran (now duke of Ch&acirc;telherault) to the north of Scotland and during this expedition he died at Elgin, some time before 10 May, worth &pound;3582 Scots. His widow lived until at least 1560.<br>
<br>Douglas is one of the more fascinating figures of his time, not least because so much of his correspondence survives and because so much was written about him by contemporaries. Bishop John Lesley spoke for many when he described him as &#145;sa well knawin&#146; in Scotland, England, and France for his &#145;inventionis&#146; and for his &#145;politique and wechtie effertis&#146;  (Lesley, 244). His &#145;falsehood&#146; enraged Englishmen, then and later, and has led to his coming to be perceived as treacherous and unpatriotic, ready to sell out his country for gain. However, the circumstances of sixteenth-century Scottish political life were such as to make a certain slipperiness essential for survival, and in any case there were limits to Pittendriech's unreliability. The one man he never played false was his brother, and he was ever loyal to his kinsfolk; when Dalkeith was taken in 1548, the house was full of them. Like Angus, he lived and died in the faith of the Douglases.<br>
