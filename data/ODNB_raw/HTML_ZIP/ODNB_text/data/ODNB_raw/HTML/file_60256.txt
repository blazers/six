<span class="headword">Mattos,  Katharine Elizabeth Alan  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Katharine Elizabeth Alan Stevenson; <em>pseud. </em>Theodor  Hertz-Garten]</span>  (1851&#150;1939), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Scotland, the youngest of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26427/', "Alan Stevenson (1807&#150;1865)")</script>, lighthouse engineer, and his wife, Margaret Scott Jones (1812&#150;1895). Like her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26437/', "Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson")</script>, Katharine Stevenson was one of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26438/', "Robert Louis Stevenson's")</script> favourite cousins: together, the three children enjoyed spending their holidays roaming the Scottish hills on their ponies. This friendship was to last until well into adulthood and the early years of R. L. Stevenson's marriage to Fanny van de Grift Osbourne. According to Robert Louis Stevenson's biographer, Frank McLynn, Katharine became a charismatic and very intelligent woman: Stevenson's appreciation is evident in his affectionate dedication to her of <span class="italic">The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</span> (1886).<br>
<br>Katharine Stevenson shocked her friends and family when she decided to wed the Cambridge atheist and notorious philanderer William Sydney de Mattos (<i>b</i>. 1850/51). The union proved to be an incompatible one almost immediately after their marriage on 25 June 1874: Katharine had to beg for financial assistance and, finally, opted for a judicial separation in 1881. The couple had two children who were left in the care of their mother; William de Mattos later emigrated to Canada.<br>
<br>After the break-up of her marriage Katharine de Mattos settled in London and tried to support herself and her children by writing. Stevenson assisted her by introducing her to some of his friends, including the poet William Ernest Henley. Henley not only adopted her as a member of his circle but, according to Charles Baxter and Stevenson, also nourished a passion for her. She started to write for the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span>, which was edited by Henley, and for other periodicals including the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, <span class="italic">Sylvia's Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Windsor Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. She became widely known, however, for her part in the breach between W. E. Henley and R. L. Stevenson in 1888. In a now-famous letter to Robert Louis Stevenson, Henley accused Fanny Stevenson of having plagiarized one of Katharine de Mattos's stories. The row was fierce and protracted, leaving many people deeply hurt: Stevenson came to blame Katharine for all that had happened&#151;&#145;I regard her as the wicked mainspring of all this distress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.200)&#151;and he considerably reduced her share in his final will in spite of his father's wishes.<br>
<br>By that time, however, Katharine de Mattos had succeeded in establishing her career as a professional writer, although Stevenson had, at one time, articulated his reservations about her writing talents and had thought of acting as a ghost writer for her. Some of her (admittedly small) living derived from translations and a few short stories published under the pseudonym Theodor Hertz-Garten. One translation, that of Vicomte Henri Delaborde's <span class="italic">La gravure</span>, was published under her brother's name in 1885. Her main source of income from 1886 up to 1908, however, must have stemmed from her anonymous pieces in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, to which she contributed, at the peak of her involvement (mainly in the 1890s), an average of seventy reviews a year. Considering that she was paid &pound;10 a book in 1906, those top years yielded an income of about &pound;350 a year. She usually reviewed a great number of new novels, also the &#145;novels of the week&#146;, some of the short stories, and exceptionally a book in the &#145;Our library table&#146; column. It is unclear what happened to Katharine de Mattos after 1908, when she ceased to contribute to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. She died of &#145;senile decay&#146; on 13 April 1939, at Beaufort Mansions, Chelsea.<br>
