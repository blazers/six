<span class="headword">Prince,  John</span>  (1643&#150;1723), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Newenham Abbey farmhouse in Axminster, Devon, on the site of the Cistercian abbey, and probably baptized at Uffculme on 4 February 1644, the eldest son of Bernard Prince (<i>d</i>. 1689) and his first wife, Mary, daughter of John Crocker of Lyneham, Yealmpton, Devon. His kinsman Sir John Drake, maternal uncle to John Churchill, later duke of Marlborough, was his godfather. Prince matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 13 July 1660, and graduated BA on 23 April 1664. The same year Lord Petre nominated him to one of the fellowships on the foundation at Exeter College vacated by ejected nonconformists, but the right of patronage was not acknowledged by the college.<br>
<br>Prince was ordained as curate to Arthur Giffard, rector of Bideford, north Devon, and he remained there until the rector's death in March 1669. His next post was at St Martin's, Exeter, where he seems to have been curate and minister until 1675. While there he published, in 1674, <span class="italic">A Humble Defence of the Exeter Bill in Parliament for Uniting the Parishes</span> and <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached &hellip; at the Visitation of the Bishop of Exon</span>. It was probably also at Exeter that he met and married Gertrude (1644&#150;1725), youngest daughter of Anthony Salter, physician at Exeter, and his wife, Gertrude, daughter of John Acland.<br>
<br>In 1675 Prince was incorporated at Cambridge, and proceeded MA from Gonville and Caius College. From 25 December 1675 until 1681, according to articles of agreement between the corporation and himself, he received a stipend of &pound;50 from the vicarage of Totnes, Devon, being instituted on 4 April 1676. On 21 April 1681 he was instituted, on the presentation of Sir Edward Seymour, to the neighbouring vicarage of Berry Pomeroy.<br>
<br>Prince published a few other religious tracts and several unpublished sermons and tracts by him are mentioned by Anthony Wood, some of them withheld because they were too intemperate in their opposition to dissenters. His great work was the chatty and entertaining <span class="italic">Danmonii orientales illustres</span>, better known by its subtitle, <span class="italic">The Worthies of Devon</span>. The first edition came out in 1701, with a dedication &#145;from my study, Aug. 6 1697&#146;. The manuscript materials on which it is based were a transcript by Prince of the work of Sir William Pole  (BL, Add. MS 28649) and a similar transcript of Thomas Westcote's &#145;View of Devonshire&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Top Devon b 1&#150;6, c 6&#150;19, e 7&#150;8). The insertions between brackets in the 1845 published text of Westcote's work were from Prince's notes, and are described in the introduction as containing many errors. Prince also owned in the 1680s the manuscript of John Hooker's &#145;Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire&#146;  (Devon RO). His own library was very small, but he had the free use of the very good library of Robert Burscough, his successor at Totnes.<br>
<br>A long letter from Prince to Sir Philip Sydenham dated 5 August 1712  (BL, Egerton MS 2035) details the problems faced in the publication (by subscription) of <span class="italic">The Worthies of Devon</span>, a task made more difficult by a sentence given against him for misconduct, which deprived him of his living in 1700. During the appeal he incurred the wrath of Bishop Trelawny, who described him as &#145;impudent&#146; and as having &#145;as little truth as modesty&#146;  (Smith). The result of Prince's appeal is uncertain, but in 1701 he resumed his duties at Berry Pomeroy, where he remained for the rest of his life. Prince died intestate on 9 September 1723 and was buried in the chancel of the church at Berry Pomeroy. Letters of administration were granted to his widow, who was herself buried there on 4 February 1725.<br>
