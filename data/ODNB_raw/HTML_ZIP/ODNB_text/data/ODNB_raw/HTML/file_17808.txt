<span class="headword">Maine, Sir  Henry James Sumner</span>  (1822&#150;1888), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, the son of James Maine MD, of Kelso, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of David Fell of Caversham Grove, Reading, was born at Hockliffe, Bedfordshire, on 15 August 1822.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylegalinterests"></a>Education and early legal interests</h2>Maine's early years were passed at first on Jersey and then at Henley-on-Thames. When he was still a child his father left home and Maine was cared for exclusively by his mother. He attended the school of a local teacher in Henley, Mrs Lamb, until in 1829 his godfather, John Bird Sumner, then bishop of Chester and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, nominated him for a place at Christ's Hospital school. A delicate child, Maine suffered throughout life from weak health. He was unhappy at school but was promising as a pupil, and in 1840 he won an exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He proved to be the best classical scholar of his year, winning the Browne medal in 1842 and 1843, and the chancellor's medal in 1842, and he was senior classic in 1844 as well as a senior optime in the mathematical tripos. His health was always uncertain and he devoted his energies to intellectual matters; he was a member of the Apostles club and formed lifelong friendships with contemporaries such as James Fitzjames Stephen.<br>
<br>In 1845 Maine accepted a junior tutorship, without a fellowship, at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and in 1847 at the age of twenty-five he was appointed regius professor of civil law. On 20 December of the same year he married Jane Main (1827&#150;1920), his first cousin. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in June 1850. It was during these early years that Henry Maine linked his classical interests to the historical study of law and also became committed to improvements in legal education. There is little clear evidence about the development of Maine's legal ideas at this time, but it is likely that he was reading historical studies such as those by Sir William Jones and J. M. Kemble which sought to explain law by reference to its past and placed a particular emphasis on the analysis of language. Whatever the nature of his early speculative reading, by the 1850s Maine had begun to lose interest in the teaching of law at Cambridge: in July 1852 he was appointed the first reader in Roman law and jurisprudence at the Council of Legal Education which had been established in that year by the inns of court in London; consequently in 1854 he resigned his chair at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Following his move to London, Maine developed a strong interest in writing for the press. In 1851 he had contributed to the Peelite <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, edited by John Douglas Cook. With Cook he became, in November 1855, a founding editor of the newly established <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. This was to acquire a distinguished reputation for literary and political articles, of which Maine was a frequent contributor until 1861. At the same time he began to practise at the bar, concentrating at first on the common law courts and then turning to chancery. He rapidly came to dislike both types of work and became increasingly critical of his profession and its ideas. His interest in legal thought became stronger, and he started to establish a reputation for the high quality of his lectures on jurisprudence which he now delivered at the inns of court for prospective barristers. No record remains of what he said in his lectures: this omission is perhaps the most unfortunate of all in respect of the information that has been lost on nineteenth-century legal thought in England. However, there is evidence in his published syllabus, in his article &#145;Roman law and legal education&#146; in <span class="italic">Cambridge Essays</span> (1856), and in later incidental observations on the part of those who attended his lectures, which suggests that he was developing themes that were to appear in his first and most famous book, <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> (1861).<h2>
<a name="MaineandAncientLaw"></a>Maine and Ancient Law</h2>Those who neither attended Maine's lectures nor read his book sometimes assumed that he was an authority on Roman law. In fact <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> reveals that he was not greatly interested in Roman law for its own sake; he sought rather to integrate his analysis of the subject into general historical explanations of legal change in societies around the world. He produced these generalizations about law in the course of considering numerous sources of information. Any particular chapter could contain observations on modern politics mixed with comments on statute law, poetry, philosophy, literature, Greek thought, the caste system in India, Roman agriculture, the duties of nineteenth-century bank managers, the nature of scientific theories, American social values, the political influence of women, and many other topics.<br>
<br>For the most part Maine used his sources to explain the history of laws in Indo-European societies. In his view, the first laws of these societies were imposed by individuals who justified their power by reference to divine authority. Their laws were followed by customs (for Maine, custom followed law rather than preceded it), which gradually came to be controlled by minorities such as aristocracies. In the course of time the minorities were deprived of power through revolt, and the authorities which replaced them sought to assert their rule through the creation and development of codes. In some rare cases it was possible for societies to progress further through using fictions, equity, and legislation as successive agencies of legal change. The substance of these later progressive legal phases was described by Maine in his famous phrase as involving a movement from &#145;status to contract&#146;. For example, the slave had his or her status determined at birth, whereas the citizen of the modern state should be able, under the law, to negotiate with employers and others in such a way as to shape his or her life through the exercise of independent judgement. Early law might concentrate in particular upon the family, and the status of men, women, and children within it; but later law was focused on individuals and the exercise of their rights in accordance with what they saw to be their own interests.<br>
<br>To mention these ideas in this brief manner is to do no justice to Maine's persuasive power. He spoke with clarity and wit and he wrote excellent prose. Maine was all the more attractive to his Victorian audience because of his capacity to integrate popular themes into his arguments. <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> was published too soon after the appearance of Darwin's <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> for the latter to account for Maine's book; but Maine was sensitive to the ideas produced by geological theorists in the 1840s and 1850s who stressed the possibility of evolutionary change over immense periods of time. To Maine the link with jurisprudence was plain:<blockquote>If by any means we can determine the early forms of jural conceptions, they will be invaluable to us. These rudimentary ideas are to the jurist what the primary crusts of the earth are to the geologist. They contain, potentially, all the forms in which law has subsequently exhibited itself. The haste or the prejudice which has generally refused them all but the most superficial examination, must bear the blame of the unsatisfactory condition in which we find the science of jurisprudence. (H. Maine, <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span>, 1861, 1&#150;2)</blockquote>Within the framework of such generalizations Maine persistently asked the question: does law change society or society law? In his view other English jurists, such as Bentham and Austin, had failed to address this question. In considering it he came to believe that lawyers deluded themselves if they saw law as an effective instrument of social change. On the contrary, social developments usually determined both the content and the form of the law, and if law was to be understood it had to be seen in social terms. When he discussed society Maine was candid in stating many of his assumptions. He argued that &#145;social necessities and social opinion are always more or less in advance of law&#146;  (H. Maine, <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span>, 1861, 24). Fortified by assumptions such as these Maine was prepared to pronounce on the comparative achievements of different groups. For example, he believed that there were inescapable limits to what the ancient Greeks could achieve in legal thought:<blockquote>The Greek intellect, with all its mobility and elasticity, was quite unable to confine itself within the straight waistcoat of a legal formula &hellip; it confounded law and fact &hellip; questions of pure law were constantly argued on every consideration which could possibly influence the mind of the judges. No durable system of jurisprudence could be produced in this way. (ibid., 75&#150;6)</blockquote>But Maine's confidence in arguing why some societies had failed properly to develop law was not linked to any assured explanation of progress. Progress could be found in the movement from status to contract but why this movement occurred in certain societies and not others was inexplicable. &#145;The difference between the stationary and progressive societies is &hellip; one of the great secrets which inquiry has yet to penetrate&#146;  (ibid., 23).<h2>
<a name="Lessonsofhistory"></a>Lessons of history</h2>Despite this Maine was certain that he could reveal many of the &#145;lessons&#146; of history for Victorian politicians and administrators. In respect of the impact of British law on Indian customs and the caste system he used his historical arguments to suggest that there was no question of British law being able to preserve old ways. Even a British law which declared that ancient customs should be recognized would inevitably ensure that the social role of these customs was changed because, by reason of the new law, they would lose their capacity to adapt over time to new social conditions. Legal recognition fixed them at one moment in time. It followed that informed historical judgement and considerable caution were desirable attributes for a colonial administrator. History was just as useful as a guide to an understanding of rights in modern Western societies. Arguments in favour of the law of nature, or of rights arising out of some supposed ancient social contract, were often treated with hostility and even contempt by Maine. They could not be justified in historical terms.<br>
<br>Maine was more sustained, more subtle, but ultimately no less dismissive, in his analysis of the chief traditions of English legal thought. For him so much of what English lawyers believed was founded on historical misapprehensions. For example, it was nonsense to describe the modern common law as being in some sense unwritten. Such historical errors were of the first importance because they could seriously impede desirable reforms. Undue veneration for the common law obscured the merits of statutory codification. In going beyond the common law and considering the system of equity, Maine argued that:<blockquote>it is easily seen by English lawyers that English equity is a system founded on moral rules; but it is forgotten that these rules are the morality of past centuries&#151;not of the present&#151;that they have received nearly as much application as they are capable of, and that though of course they do not differ largely from the ethical creed of our own day, they are not necessarily on a level with it &hellip; (H. Maine, <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span>, 1861, 69&#150;70)</blockquote>Again and again Maine questioned the historical assumptions of English lawyers. He was as critical of theorists as of practitioners. He respected the clarity of analysis to be found in the works of Jeremy Bentham and John Austin, but he also believed that through their ignorance of the historical relationship between law and society these major utilitarian jurists had arrived at incorrect conclusions about the nature of law. He criticized any attempt to account for law through the use of concepts dear to the utilitarians: he was distrustful of the use of terms such as &#145;sovereignty&#146; and &#145;command&#146; without regard to their precise historical and social context. For Maine, Bentham and Austin failed to see that the concepts they were using could not explain changes in the ancient laws of India where such notions had little or no place. A twentieth-century jurist, Sir Carleton Allen, suggested that it was in his lectures of the 1850s that Maine first made the distinction between analytical and historical schools of English jurisprudence  (C. Allen, <span class="italic">Legal Duties and other Essays in Jurisprudence</span>, 1931, 14). The former concentrated on conceptual analysis and sought brief definitions of law. The latter recognized law as a social product and explained it as the creation of contrasting societies evolving over long periods of time. Maine's ideas were a reaction against what he believed was a narrow vision of law reflecting merely modern English experience.<br>
<br>Maine's explanation of law was distinctive. He was not following the views of professional lawyers who believed in what they took to be the immemorial virtues of the common law. Nor was he following the recognized jurists of the day with their emphasis on the demands of utility and the capacity for using law as an instrument of social reform. Instead he was using history to explain law as the product of time and place and, having done this to his own satisfaction, he was always seeking to commend one course of action rather than another. The result was a series of arguments which did little to flatter lawyers. Maine stated that it was the task of a good lawyer to respond constructively to social change rather than produce it. In substance, he asserted that the task of both the practising lawyer and the legal theorist was to clarify the law and to ascertain whether or not it met current social need; if it did not do so, the lawyer should suggest appropriate reform. For Maine it was as if the focal point of legal analysis ceased to be the professional world, or the conceptual work of utilitarian jurists; instead the lawyer was the reflective observer of social change. In a loose sense, he saw the law as a facet of cultural evolution, always and everywhere its improvement requiring historical understanding on the part of the reformer.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> was probably the best-selling English law book of the nineteenth century: it sold around the world, sometimes in translation. The mixture of analysis and exhortation was attractive: it seemed to many that Maine was offering the prospect of ordered change at a time when old certainties were being questioned. Evolutionary ideas which many found disturbing in other contexts were being put to use in arguments which justified reflection, comparative analysis, and cautious change, in favour of an enhanced role for individual decision-making. What was more, the informed citizen could contribute to legal debate confident in the knowledge that legal minds had only an instrumental rather than a definitive role in the production of reform.<h2>
<a name="Indiaandrecognition"></a>India and recognition</h2>The publication of <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> was the central event of Maine's life. The book established his reputation as a jurist and attracted more attention than anything else he wrote. Soon after it appeared, in March 1862 he accepted Sir Charles Wood's offer of the position of legal member of the governor-general's council in India. Assisted there by his friend M. E. Grant Duff, he was involved in giving advice and drafting bills. Between 1863 and 1869 he was also vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, and in this capacity he combined a liking for comparative observations on Eastern and Western thought, with some alarm about the possible political roles of the increasing number of Indian law graduates. On his return to England in 1869 he became corpus professor of jurisprudence at Oxford until, in December 1877, he was elected master of Trinity Hall in Cambridge. In these later years he did little to advance the cause of legal education; for example, he did not try to support joint degrees in law and history which were being discontinued at Oxford at this time. Instead he advised successive governments on colonial issues, engaged in political journalism, and published further books which were mostly collected essays, including <span class="italic">Dissertations on Early Law and Custom</span> (1883).<br>
<br>Maine's reputation as a scholar with an interest in public life achieved wide recognition. In 1871 Maine became Sir Henry when he was gazetted KCSI, and in the same year he was appointed to a seat on the Indian council in London. In 1866 he had been made a member of the American Academy. He became a member of the Dutch Institute about 1876, of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1877, of the Madrid Academy in 1878, of the Royal Irish Academy in 1882, of the Washington Anthropological Society in 1883, and of the Juridical Society of Moscow in 1884. He became corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1881, and foreign member, in place of Emerson, in 1883. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, and was elected an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1887. In that year he had succeeded Sir William Harcourt as Whewell professor of international law at Cambridge. His lectures were edited after his death by Frederic Harrison and Sir Frederick Pollock. At various times in his life he declined other offers: the chief justiceship of Bengal, the permanent under-secretaryships of both the Home Office and the Foreign Office, and the principal clerkship of the House of Commons.<h2>
<a name="PopularGovernmentandotherpublications"></a>Popular Government and other publications</h2>Neither in India nor, later, in England did Maine take the opportunity of further detailed study of ancient systems of law and their social contexts in village and urban life. He never learned Sanskrit and he carried out only minor forms of empirical work. Large parts of his later books constituted general responses to the work of other scholars such as Max M&uuml;ller, William Stubbs, J. F. McLennan, and Andrew Lang. In the course of considering the ideas of other people he would comment on topics as diverse as the sociological ideas of Herbert Spencer, the ancient Brehon laws of Ireland, French medieval history, ancestor-worship around the world, the dangers of democracy, advances in comparative philology, social change in India, and, as always, the failings of English lawyers. The reader of works such as <span class="italic">Village Communities</span> (1871), <span class="italic">Lectures on the Early History of Institutions</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">Popular Government</span> (1885) could enjoy a lively and very well written excursion through ideas of current concern to educated Victorians. Classical observations were nicely combined with current preoccupations:<blockquote>Except the blind forces of Nature, nothing moves in this world which is not Greek in its origin. A ferment spreading from that source has vitalised all the great progressive races of mankind, penetrating from one to another, and producing results accordant with its hidden and latent genius, and results of course often far greater than any exhibited in Greece itself. It is this principle of progress which we Englishmen are communicating to India. We did not create it. We deserve no special credit for it. It came to us filtered through many different media. But we have received it, so we pass it on. There is no reason why, if it has time to work, it should not develop in India effects as wonderful as in any other of the societies of mankind. (H. Maine, <span class="italic">Village Communities</span>, 4th edn, 1885, 238)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Popular Government</span>, four essays which had previously appeared in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, in particular sold well, was much discussed, and attracted criticisms by John Morley and E. L. Godkin. But it did little to sustain Maine's standing as a scholar. He warned of the dangers of democratic politics, and compared the actions of Gladstone's government to the excesses of the French revolution. He claimed that democracy would become rule by the mob, and that technological progress would be threatened because innovation was opposed by most people, not least by women, who were always suspicious of change. One possible remedy, he believed, might be a written constitution similar to that of the United States of America; this would allow excesses of popular activity to be focused on merely political change, while it would leave individuals free to pursue their own interests in everyday economic life and guarantee the preservation of private property. Maine avoided endorsement of any political party but, in anonymous articles for the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, he expressed support for disillusioned Liberals who were alarmed at extensions of the franchise and novel plans for imperial reform such as those furthered by Viscount Ripon in India. His pessimism blended with late Victorian worries as to the nature of democracy.<h2>
<a name="CriticismsofMaine"></a>Criticisms of Maine</h2>Maine's grand generalizations were popular but they exposed him to numerous criticisms by scholars which, often unanswered, accumulated as the years went by. Even <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> came to be criticized with increasing force: for many authorities there was no convincing evidence to justify Maine's analysis of the phases of legal change, or of the nature of early ownership, or of the role of codes, or of many other topics. His friends, such as James Bryce, privately expressed concern about Maine's preparedness to write about topics on which he was not fully informed. Leslie Stephen observed that &#145;his inability for drudgery shows itself by one weakness of his books, the almost complete absence of any reference to authorities&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Maine's most earnest defender was his only rival as a historical jurist, Sir Paul Vinogradoff. Speaking of those who questioned Maine's achievements he stated that &#145;Those who indulge in such cheap criticisms should rather try to realise what accounts for his having been a force in European thought, a potentate in a realm where parochial patronage and a mere aptitude for vulgarisation are not recognised as titles to eminence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, 20, 1904, 119&#150;20). There was substance in this bitter response, for the general ideas in <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span> (such as those on status and contract) had acquired a strong reputation in Europe and had attracted the attention of major theorists such as Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies and &Eacute;mile Durkheim.<br>
<br>For the greater part of the twentieth century the British response to Maine's work remained unfavourable. Anthropologists and authorities on Roman law were particularly critical of his ideas, and teachers of law gave his works little attention. Stanley Baldwin recalled that he had been taught about Maine's ideas at Cambridge, but the extent of the latter's influence was apparent in Baldwin's observation: &#145;From Status to Contract&#151;or was it the other way around?&#146; Legal historians looked to Maitland for inspiration, not Maine. Jurists gave little attention to historical issues. In Herbert Hart's major work, <span class="italic">The Concept of Law</span> (1961), there is no mention of any of Maine's works. Only the quality of Maine's prose and his succinct generalizations ensured that he was occasionally remembered.<h2>
<a name="Arevivingreputation"></a>A reviving reputation</h2>In the last quarter of the twentieth century Maine's reputation began to revive. In part this arose indirectly out of increasing British interest in the ideas of the continental theorists who had respected Maine. In the 1990s this indirect influence was supplemented by scholars in eastern Europe who pointed out that in the middle of the twentieth century Maine's works had been a precious reminder of the possibility of non-Marxist explanations of legal history: sometimes intellectuals in St Petersburg, Cracow, Budapest, or Sofia instructed their British counterparts in Maine's ideas. But chiefly his enhanced standing arose out of the revival of interest in explaining law by reference to its social context. With this change in perspective Maine ceased to be seen as an inadequate theoretician and became instead the perceptive source of ways of looking at the social reality of legal change. There was praise for his suggestive work in areas including linguistics, sociology, political science, legal history, and jurisprudence. Increasingly he came to be recognized not as a failed &#145;system-builder&#146; but as a creative innovator who encouraged new forms of enquiry.<h2>
<a name="DeathofMaine"></a>Death of Maine</h2>Maine died on 3 February 1888 at Montfleury Hotel, Cannes, France, leaving a widow and two sons, the eldest of whom, Charles Sumner Maine, clerk of assize on the south Wales circuit, died soon after his father. Maine was commemorated in Westminster Abbey, but his burial at Cannes was more appropriate as a guide to the standing of his thought. The least parochial of English jurists, after the publication of <span class="italic">Ancient Law</span>, his ideas became a part of continental thought.<br>
