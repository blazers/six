<span class="headword">Greenly,  Edward</span>  (1861&#150;1951), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Bristol on 3 December 1861, the only child of Charles Hickes Greenly (1804&#150;1895), medical practitioner, and his wife, Harriett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dowling (1818&#150;1892). He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and in 1883 became for three years an articled clerk to a London solicitor. His real interests, however, increasingly came to lie in science and, probably from 1886, his father paid for him to attend University College, London, where he studied chemistry. He was mainly self-taught as a geologist, and in his spare time he began an interest in geological mapping. Quite by chance he met Professor A. H. Green (1832&#150;1896) of Leeds, to whom he showed his maps. Green recommended Greenly to the director of the Geological Survey to which he was appointed in July 1889. He went to the northern highlands of Scotland, where he learned geological field techniques from the experienced surveyors B. N. Peach and C. T. Clough, and developed a lifelong fascination with Precambrian metamorphic rocks. On 26 September 1891 he married Annie, the fourth of the five daughters of John Barnard, dispensing chemist, of Bath, who often accompanied him on his geological work. They had no children.<br>
<br>Greenly resigned from the official survey in the spring of 1895 because of his wife's health. A man of modest but independent means, he spent the next fifteen years mapping the Isle of Anglesey. His meticulously accurate map and report of these mainly Precambrian rocks were &#145;adopted&#146; by the Geological Survey, published in 1919 and earned him an honorary doctorate (1919) from the University of Wales, and in 1920 the Lyell medal of the Geological Society of London (of which he was a senior fellow and later vice-president).<br>
<br>About 1917 Greenly moved to Clevedon, Somerset, where he made valuable contributions to Precambrian, Palaeozoic, and Quaternary geology. After June 1919 he lived in Bangor, and mapped in the Arfon district, a natural extension of his studies of Anglesey and which became his final geological work. He continued his researches with vigour, having learned to drive a car at the age of seventy-five and despite the amputation of a leg three years later. He led his last field excursion to Anglesey at the age of eighty-six.<br>
<br>Greenly, in addition to his Anglesey memoir, was the author of over fifty geological papers, several being conceptually far ahead of their time. He also co-authored (with Howel Williams) the invaluable <span class="italic">Methods in Geological Surveying</span> (1930), and other books for the general reader.<br>
<br>Greenly has been aptly described as &#145;a gentleman of the old school, kindly, courteous and cultured&#146;. He was a connoisseur of music, especially Beethoven's piano works, poetry, and literature (in several languages). All the field sketches and watercolours illustrating his geological work were his own. He was also a lover of animals, cats especially, and a vegetarian. His exquisite prose is perhaps most evident in his unusual book <span class="italic">A Hand through Time</span> (1938), which he had originally intended should not be published until after his death. This meditative and philosophical work, written after the death of his beloved wife in March 1927, is largely composed of memories of her; their relationship was unusually close and mutually inspiring. It also includes descriptions of his early days on the survey and pen portraits of the great geologists of those times. Greenly was religious in a pantheistic, non-doctrinal sense, and had a serene assurance of an immortal reunion with his wife. Greenly died at his residence at Aethwy Ridge, Bangor after a brief illness on 4 March 1951. After cremation, his ashes were interred at Llangristiolus, Anglesey.<br>
