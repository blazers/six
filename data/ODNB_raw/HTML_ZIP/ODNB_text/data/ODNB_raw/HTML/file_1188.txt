<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  James, of Pittendreich</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1583), <span class="occ">politician and legal writer</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Michael Balfour (<i>d</i>. 1577) of Mountquhanie in Fife, and Joneta Boswell. He may have been educated at St Andrews in 1539 or 1540, when he would have been about fifteen years old, and was at Wittenberg in 1544. In 1546, with his father and his brothers David and Gilbert, he entered St Andrews Castle and joined those who on 29 May had slain Cardinal David Beaton and were holding out against the earl of Arran, the governor of Scotland. Balfour had at some point taken priest's orders, but was now a fanatical Calvinist. After the castle surrendered, on 31 July 1547, Balfour and the evangelical preacher John Knox were among those impressed into the French service as galley slaves. About 1549 the Balfour brothers were released, and by 1553 James Balfour had become official of Lothian, a high ecclesiastical judge, while by 1555 he was vicar of Kilmany, Fife. After the &#145;uproar for religion&#146; which broke out at Perth in May 1559 Balfour became a propagandist for the queen regent, Mary of Guise, and he also joined the reformers in order to bring dissension among them and to spy on their activities. In 1560 he became rector of Flisk, Fife. After the young Queen Mary's return from France, on 14 August 1561, Balfour was made an extraordinary (and unpaid) lord of the court of session on the spiritual side (12 November 1561), and on 15 November 1563 he was promoted to an ordinary (permanent and paid) place on the bench.<br>
<br>When the new commissary courts were organized at the beginning of 1564 to replace the pre-Reformation church courts, Balfour, as a former official of Lothian, was chosen as chief of the four commissaries of Edinburgh, with a salary of 400 merks. He held the office until October 1565. By 1565 he was a privy councillor, at first (in July) as one of the <i>extraordinarii</i>, and from September onwards as a regular councillor. In the spring of 1566 he was appointed to the valuable office of clerk register; he was also knighted, with the style of Sir James Balfour of Pittendreich, Fife. At this time he claimed to be a Lutheran. In the same year he was appointed to a parliamentary commission to revise the laws. The result of the commission's labours was the collection of the acts of the Scottish parliament from 1424 to 1566, published at Edinburgh in the latter year and known as the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span> because the typeface used was English black letter. Balfour's work is commended in the preface to this compilation.<br>
<br>By October 1566 Balfour was active in support of James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, who regarded King Henry (formerly Lord Darnley) as an obstacle to his ambitions. When the king was murdered on 10 February 1567, Balfour was widely regarded as the principal counsellor and deviser of the deed, and as a result he was arrested by the earl of Moray and warded in Edinburgh Castle. But his confinement was brief, and he was soon made captain of the castle. He appeared at the parliament of April and served on the committee dealing with the manner of holding the sessions. A fortnight after Mary's marriage to Bothwell (15 May 1567), Balfour joined with the opposition lords in a band to free the queen from Bothwell's control. When Mary marched to defeat and capture at Carberry Hill, on 15 June, Balfour did nothing to support her. At Bothwell's request, he gave out a casket of letters to a servant of Bothwell, but at the same time he informed the opposition lords, who intercepted the papers, and he also gave them artillery from the castle.<br>
<br>After Mary's abdication the new regent, the earl of Moray, agreed that Balfour, as the person most strongly implicated in King Henry's assassination, was to use his good offices to pursue the murderers. In exchange for the captaincy of Edinburgh Castle Balfour received a remission for any crimes and was granted the priory of Pittenweem, Fife; he also received a pension out of the priory of St Andrews for his son, and was given a lump sum of &pound;5000. In addition, he exchanged the office of clerk register for that of lord president of the court of session (6 December 1567). In the same month he appeared in parliament and among the lords of the articles as prior of Pittenweem. However, at the insistence of the earl of Lennox, father of the murdered king, and after acrimonious debate in the council, the government decided to prosecute William Maitland of Lethington and Balfour. The latter was warded in Stirling and almost immediately placed in free ward in St Andrews on caution of &pound;20,000 not to practise with England. But when Lennox became regent in July 1570, after Moray's murder, Balfour joined the Marians, and for two years was the most extreme partisan of the queen in the ensuing civil war. Forfeited in August 1571, Balfour received a remission in November 1572 for crimes of which he declared himself innocent: his forfeiture was reduced, and he made profession of the true religion. He assisted in the pacification of Perth (23 February 1573) between the parties to the civil war, and took his place in parliament as prior of Pittenweem and served on committees to revise the law and consider church policy. In May 1579, however, the earl of Morton (formerly regent, and still in control of the person of the young James VI) began proceedings against Balfour and the Hamiltons, and on 24 November the forfeiture of 1571 was extended to disinherit Balfour's heirs. Balfour, who was probably now over fifty, joined the Hamilton exiles in Paris. After he had left Scotland, he corresponded with the captive Queen Mary, and about August was present at a meeting of the chief conspirators against Morton. He was now regarded as a Catholic and a Spanish agent.<br>
<br>Balfour spent most of his brief exile in France. In 1580 he went to Dieppe, and then returned to Scotland, reaching the Isle of May in the Forth, with, it was said, a &#145;messe&#146; of French crowns, on 17 December. He had been engaged in searching for evidence to incriminate Morton in King Henry's death. Since he was still under sentence of forfeiture, Balfour was conveyed secretly to Edinburgh, where on 31 December Morton was arrested as an accessory in the late king's murder; he was executed six months later, an interval which suggests that Balfour had failed to discover any truly damaging evidence to support the accusation. Queen Elizabeth marvelled at Balfour's presence in Scotland and wanted his arrest. Almost immediately after Morton's execution Balfour was granted a remission or respite for three years, on condition of his standing trial for King Henry's death, and was thereby enabled to continue the work of codifying the laws which had been begun under Morton. King James made a declaration of protection in his favour, but was twice compelled to declare that the protection did not wipe out the previous forfeiture, and that it did not decide the question of Balfour's guilt. In June 1582 Balfour appeared as an elder at the general assembly of the church and he regained possession of his lands, for in 1582 and 1583 he directed the transcription of ancient chronicles at Burleigh.<br>
<br>Balfour died in 1583, some time after 31 July, and was survived by his wife, Dame Margaret Balfour, heir of Burleigh, and by six sons and three daughters. The family subsequently benefited from further restoration of Sir James's properties. His eldest son, Michael, was created Lord Balfour of Burleigh by James VI in 1607, and that line continued uninterrupted until the forfeiture of the fifth lord after the 1715 rising.<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Balfour was a most able man, of undisputed legal talents. These are apparent from his contribution to the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>, and still more from his <span class="italic">Practicks</span> (1754; new edn, 1962&#150;3). The latter, effectively a legal encyclopaedia compiled from all available sources&#151;statutes, decisions, and the &#145;auld lawes&#146;&#151;was unique in respect of its great bulk. The pre-eminent written record of Scots law for over a century, the <span class="italic">Practicks</span> must have satisfied a pressing need for a compendium of this kind. About twenty manuscript copies survive from between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries. As late as 1861 Lord President Inglis referred to it as a work of undoubted authority. Besides its intrinsic worth, it is valuable as a source of judicial records no longer extant. The opinion of contemporaries (including Mary, queen of Scots, and John Knox) was that Balfour was a repeated religious and political turncoat; and he had some involvement in the deaths of many of the public figures of his time&#151;particularly King Henry. Richard Bannatyne, John Knox's secretary, reported in 1573 that it was said of Balfour that he would &#145;tak the way that myght mak him advancement, howbeit that the same were to the destructione of all honest and godlie men, and of his native cuntrie also&#146;  (Bannatyne, 41). Walter Goodall, in his preface to the 1754 edition of the <span class="italic">Practicks</span>, attempted a limited rehabilitation, but subsequent historians have found no reason to question these opinions.<br>
