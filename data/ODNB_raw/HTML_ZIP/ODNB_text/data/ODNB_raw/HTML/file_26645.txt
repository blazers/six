<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stratford,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1275&#150;1348), <span class="occ">administrator and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was probably born at Stratford upon Avon into a prosperous burgher family.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlycareer"></a>Family background and early career</h2>The name of John's father was Robert, as was that of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26648/', "Robert Stratford (c.1292&#150;1362)")</script>, a future bishop of Chichester. His mother was called Isabel. Robert senior has been identified as &#145;Master&#146; Robert, co-founder and first master of the hospital of St Cross within the town, but in view of the title <i>magister</i> and the celibate status required, this appears unlikely. The family was related to the Hattons, important men in the town, Ralph Hatton &#145;of Stratford&#146;, the future bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1354), being John's nephew. Nothing definite is known of Stratford's schooling. He studied at Oxford, though not, as Anthony Wood claims, at Merton. By 1312 he was entitled doctor of civil law. He entered the service of Worcester Priory, but initially his beneficial progress was slow. However, by 1317 he was rector of Holy Trinity, Stratford, and acting as official of Bishop John Dalderby of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1320), whose executor he became. From Lincoln he migrated to Canterbury, and the service of Archbishop Walter Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1327). He was dean of the court of arches in the early 1320s, by which time he held a useful portfolio of benefices, including canonries at Lichfield, Lincoln, and York, as well as the archdeaconry of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Stratford first attended a royal council in 1317 at Clarendon. With other clerks trained in law, he was summoned to the parliaments that met at York in 1318, 1319, and 1320&#151;assemblies concerned with the implementation of the treaty of Leake, with Thomas of Lancaster's claim to the stewardship of the royal household, and with the ordinances. In 1320 he accompanied Edward II and Queen Isabella to Amiens, for the performance of homage for Aquitaine, and at the end of 1321 he travelled to Avignon, on an abortive mission to secure the see of Coventry and Lichfield for Robert Baldock (<i>d</i>. 1327). Following a brief appearance at York he returned to the curia, where he remained for about a year engaged on a variety of business: the relaxation of oaths (perhaps those committing the government to the ordinances?), the foundation of the Dominican priory at Kings Langley, where Piers Gaveston was buried, and the diversion of a papal tenth to the king.<h2>
<a name="BishopanddiplomatunderEdwardII"></a>Bishop and diplomat under Edward II</h2>Fortuitously Stratford was still abroad in April 1323 when the wealthy bishopric of Winchester fell vacant, through Rigaud d'Assier's death at the curia. Edward II sent letters in favour of Baldock, which Stratford delivered, but the nominee was <i>persona non grata</i> with Pope John XXII (<i>r</i>. 1316&#150;34), who by bulls dated 20 June 1323 provided the king's envoy instead. He was consecrated six days later by Bertrand, cardinal-bishop of Tusculum. The king was furious at this outcome and on Stratford's return he was interrogated by Chief Justice Geoffrey Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1340) and Master Robert Ayleston, keeper of the privy seal, who forced him to answer to an indenture of nine articles concerning his conduct of royal business. But eventually, after he had renounced any prejudicial articles in his provisory bull and consented to receive the Winchester temporalities as an act of Edward's special grace, Stratford was permitted to take the oath of fealty. At the same time he was forced to enter into a recognizance of &pound;10,000, an obligation that was not cancelled until after Edward's abdication.<br>
<br>By mid-July 1324 the king's irritation had abated&#151;he needed his erstwhile envoy to secure the support of the pope with respect to Aquitaine and Scotland. Pope John for his part was eager to act as &#145;impartial mediator&#146; between the English and French kings, and to divert their martial energy to a crusade. Stratford became a member of an important embassy dispatched in 1324 to the French court, the first of four continental missions in which he played a major role. Unfortunately the so-called war of St Sardos precipitated a further crisis and in March 1325 Isabella herself was sent to France in an attempt to come to terms with her brother Charles IV. Stratford was one of those who advocated the move and he visited her at Poissy towards the end of the month. Later in the year he was nominated a guardian of the king's son, Edward, earl of Chester, whom he accompanied to France to perform homage at the Bois de Vincennes for the duchy of Aquitaine, which his allegedly ailing father had transferred to him. Towards the end of October Stratford embarked on his final mission of the reign in an attempt to persuade the queen to rejoin her husband. Following his return via Dover on 18 November he probably reported on his lack of success at the Westminster parliament then in session&#151;despite a note in his register claiming that matters were &#145;successfully performed&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ThedepositionofEdwardII"></a>The deposition of Edward II</h2>The lull in diplomatic employment enabled Stratford to carry out the primary visitation of his diocese, which began with an examination of the cathedral priory on 3 February 1326. He was at Southwark when Queen Isabella's force landed in September, and he joined other bishops at St Mary Overie and at Lambeth to decide on a common course of action. He volunteered to act as an emissary to the queen if Bishop Hamo Hethe (<i>d</i>. 1352) would accompany him. Shortly thereafter he joined Isabella, and was with the insurgents at Bristol on 26 October when the young Edward was recognized as <i>custos</i> of the realm. On 6 November he was appointed deputy treasurer and is said to have celebrated Christmas at Wallingford with the queen. He was a member of the delegation sent to Kenilworth to persuade Edward II to abdicate&#151;an occasion reported by his &#145;nephew&#146; Thomas Laurence de la More (Moore), who was in his entourage. He appeared at the London Guildhall to make a contribution to the rebuilding of the chapel. Stratford resigned the office of deputy treasurer on 28 January 1327 and assisted at Edward III's coronation on 1 February.<br>
<br>Following the cancellation of his recognizances he resumed his diplomatic career, travelling from Dover to Wissant on 10 March and on the last day of the month sealing a treaty with France at Paris. A member of the adolescent Edward III's council, he soon became estranged from the &#145;court party&#146; of Isabella and Mortimer, and acted as Henry of Lancaster's mouthpiece at the Salisbury parliament of 1328, subsequently being forced to defend himself from a charge of contempt for leaving the assembly without licence. Allegedly he barely escaped with his life. He continued to be associated with the Lancastrian &#145;party&#146; until Mortimer's fall in 1330, but was careful to dissociate himself from the former king's companions and the supposed plot of the earl of Kent.<h2>
<a name="ChancellorofEngland"></a>Chancellor of England</h2>With Edward III's personal rule Stratford came into his own, being appointed chancellor on 28 November 1330, an office he retained until September 1334, though during that time, when he was frequently engaged in royal affairs in various parts of the kingdom or abroad, his brother Robert, in conjunction with others, was regularly placed in charge of the seal. In April 1331 Stratford joined Edward's small flotilla, which sailed for France to enable the king to meet the French monarch and to confirm his act of homage&#151;a policy that was later to be criticized and imputed to Stratford. Towards the end of May he was engaged&#151;in the king's presence&#151;in resolving the dispute between the monks and townsmen of Bury St Edmunds. While in the area he also endeavoured to settle the grievances of the citizens of Great Yarmouth.<br>
<br>Stratford opened the Westminster parliaments of September 1331 and March 1332, and in December of 1331 and in April and May of the following year was again involved in negotiations with the French king. By December 1332 he had fallen ill and was obliged to appoint proctors for the parliament at York. On account of the Scottish situation the centre of political activity moved during 1333 to York. In consequence Stratford was in the north until 23 September. On 3 November, following the death of Simon Mepham, he was postulated as archbishop of Canterbury. This coincided with Edward's wishes, but Stratford judiciously awaited the issue of papal bulls of provision. These were issued on 26 November, after which he was enthroned at Canterbury on 9 December.<br>
<br>Stratford departed almost immediately on a mission to Paris, but on his return in January he set about the visitation of his diocese. Early in February he examined the monks of Canterbury Cathedral priory, but shortly afterwards he again left for the north, where on 6 June 1335 he was reappointed chancellor in the house of the Minorites at York. This time he retained the office until 24 March 1337 when it passed first to his brother Robert, and then to Richard Bintworth, bishop of London. He remained either at York or on the Scottish borders until February 1336. In mid-March he held a convocation at St Paul's and attended the Westminster parliament.<br>
<br>Following the mysterious death in September 1336 of the king's younger brother, John of Eltham, Stratford returned to London from Bothwell and celebrated a requiem mass at Westminster Abbey, where the young warrior was buried. He was preoccupied with national affairs at home until 1338, when he embarked with the mediating cardinals and Bishop Richard Bury of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1345) for further talks in France. Meanwhile Edward, intent on establishing continental alliances against France, travelled to meet the emperor at Koblenz. During January and February 1339 Stratford was in the Low Countries, gleaning information about French plans. In May, at Antwerp, he acted as a guarantor of the king's debts and of his agreement with the Bardi. At Marcoing he was named principal councillor of Edward, the young duke of Cornwall&#151;the future Black Prince.<br>
<br>On Bintworth's death the great seal was handed to Stratford at Lambeth on 8 December 1339. Edward was determined to sail to the continent from Orwell Haven where Stratford sought to dissuade him from what he considered a rash enterprise. He surrendered the great seal on 28 April 1340, but this merely passed to his brother Robert. In the event Edward was initially victorious in the sea battle of Sluys (24 June 1340), but lack of resources forced him to conclude the truce of Espl&eacute;chin (25 September) and on the night of 29&#150;30 November he landed secretly at Tower Steps. Extremely angry, he felt himself betrayed by the &#145;false ministers&#146; in charge of government at home, chief among them Stratford. They had failed to provide him with the sinews of war. A protracted crisis ensued.<h2>
<a name="Thecrisisof13401341"></a>The crisis of 1340&#150;1341</h2>Nicholas, Lord Cantilupe (<i>d</i>. 1355) was dispatched to Canterbury where he claimed that the archbishop was responsible for the payment of merchants in Louvain and directed him to go there, but meanwhile to appear before the king. Stratford demurred, fearing for his safety. His response was pointedly delivered in his cathedral on the feast of the passion of St Thomas (29 December 1340). In an emotional address he lamented his involvement in temporal affairs and requested his hearers to forgive him. There were, he claimed, men at the king's side who hated him, and who had been responsible for the arrest of chancery clerks, justices, and knights in defiance of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, and had even defamed him as a traitor. He solemnly pronounced the sentences of excommunication incurred <i>ipso facto</i> by all guilty parties by reason of the canons of the councils of Oxford (1222), Reading (1279), and Lambeth (1281). This was followed up on 31 December by his letter <span class="italic">Sacrosancta ecclesia</span>, a spirited defence of ecclesiastical liberty which was circulated to the comprovincial bishops by Ralph Stratford (Hatton), dean of the province. He also wrote a pastoral letter to the king, citing the example of Rehoboam, who had abandoned the council of older and wiser men, and reminding Edward of his coronation oath.<br>
<br>Unimpressed, Edward sent Ralph Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1372), steward of his household, who cited the archbishop to appear in London to answer for his conduct of the nation's affairs. Stratford pointed out that he brought no safe conduct and on 28 January complained to the new chancellor, Robert Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1349), that the levy of 1340 of every ninth lamb, sheaf, and fleece, was being unlawfully demanded from the clergy, who in the same year had promised the king a tenth, on condition of their being exempted from any tax granted by parliament. Two other letters were sent to the bishops of the province, one of them reiterating the argument expressed to Bourchier, the other deploring the exactions from the clergy and the abandonment of the rule of law. The king's response was to issue in February 1341 the <span class="italic">Libellus famosus</span>, a wide-ranging and uninhibited attack on the archbishop. Its authorship is unknown, although&#151;without evidence&#151;it has been attributed to Adam Orleton, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1345). Stratford's riposte, his <span class="italic">Excusaciones</span>, issued in March, constitutes a model of dispassionate reasoning, prefaced by a traditional statement of political philosophy. The tone throughout is that of an elder statesman addressing a wayward young monarch misled by evil counsellors, men responsible for the ill-considered, inaccurate, and disgraceful <span class="italic">Libellus</span>. In a strong defence of the integrity of his administration he provides a factual point by point rebuttal. He had, he claimed, received scant reward for his efforts and provided no favours. In short, he claimed, the <span class="italic">Libellus</span> was a sad reflection on the malicious persons who had concocted it. He was willing to defend his conduct in the appropriate place&#151;parliament. This prompted a brief riposte, <span class="italic">Cicatrix cordium superbia</span>, which was the final salvo in the pamphlet war.<br>
<br>At that point the archbishop emerged from his self-imposed seclusion to attend the parliament summoned to Westminster for 23 April 1341. On reaching the great hall of the palace of Westminster, Stratford's way was barred by Ralph Stafford and John Darcy, the king's chamberlain. He was diverted to the exchequer to answer the demands upon him there&#151;the alleged non-payment of wool for the ninth. The case was to be adjourned from session to session without result. He then joined the other bishops in the Painted Chamber, but when he attempted to enter parliament he was prevented, together with his relatives, the bishops of London and Chichester. His fearlessness in the face of threats suggests that he courted martyrdom, but the king's agents were not so foolish as to provide the occasion. Despite the attempts of William Kilsby (<i>d</i>. 1346)&#151;the keeper of the privy seal and Stratford's most consistent opponent&#151;and of Darcy to foment popular antagonism, more moderate counsels prevailed. Twelve peers, including four bishops, were deputed to investigate the charges against the archbishop and on 2 May he offered once again to purge himself. On the following day after a strong delegation of bishops, earls, and others had interceded with the king, he was readmitted to favour.<br>
<br>A more formal reconciliation is said to have taken place on 23 October in Westminster Hall, when Stratford responded to the most damaging of the articles alleged against him. In 1343 Edward ordered the annulment of Stratford's &#145;arraignment&#146; as contrary to reason, and as late as 1346 letters patent declared him blameless of the articles from which he had been &#145;deservedly excused&#146;. His political career was now largely over, but between 1342 and his death he continued to exert influence as an elder statesman, even being dubbed <i>dux regis</i> by Dene  (Haines, <span class="italic">John Stratford</span>, 359). In June 1348 he fell ill at Maidstone. He died on 23 August at his manor of Mayfield, according to &#145;Birchington&#146; in an aura of sanctity, and was buried in his cathedral on 9 September where his alabaster effigy, somewhat damaged, lies on a fine canopied tomb, in a prominent position on the south side of the choir next to Prior Eastry's screen&#151;as he had requested in his will.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticalcareerandreputation"></a>Ecclesiastical career and reputation</h2>Stratford's Canterbury register has not survived, but a large number of his <i>acta</i> can be gleaned from other sources. He was a notable legislator, drawing up detailed ordinances for the conduct of the court of Canterbury in 1342, while three sets of provincial constitutions, issued between 1341 and 1343, are attributed to him. The first set was clearly a draft, the second is particularly concerned with ecclesiastical administration and discipline, while the third was designed to preserve church liberties and deals with areas of friction between laymen and ecclesiastics. He was a notable benefactor to the hospital of St Thomas the Martyr at Canterbury, known as Eastbridge Hospital, but his efforts were principally directed towards his native Stratford, where he founded a chantry college with the same dedication. The initial foundation (1331) was for a warden, sub-warden, and three priests, but in 1336 an augmentation allowed for a further eight priests, though whether the full complement was ever achieved is uncertain. He secured the appropriation of the parish church to the foundation and a papal bull of confirmation was issued in 1345.<br>
<br>Opinion is divided as to Stratford's character, intentions, and stature&#151;he has been compared unfavourably with his predecessors John Pecham (<i>d</i>. 1292) and Robert Winchelsey (<i>d</i>. 1313). But it was partly due to his moderation and legal training that the change of monarch was accomplished so smoothly in 1326&#150;7. He certainly had a concern for what have been called &#145;Lancastrian&#146; principles, in particular the importance of parliament. During the regime of Isabella and Mortimer he hazarded his career, perhaps his life, to maintain them. Without question he was a staunch defender of the liberties of the English church. The fourth of the statutes of 1340, conceded by Edward III under constraint of circumstances, he circulated triumphantly as a &#145;charter of liberties&#146;. His clerical petitions of May 1341 were incorporated in modified form into statutes of that date, which were summarily revoked by the king a few months later as contrary to English law and his own prerogative. That he was ambitious is self-evident, but it would be indefensible to argue that he had no underlying convictions. Although he had laboured long in the cause of peace, by 1337 he was forced to accept the inevitability of war with France, though not at the price of oppression at home. Even then he was not prepared to organize opposition to Edward III, doubtless because he had no desire to renew the civil strife of the previous reign. He may have been guilty of pride (<i>superbia</i>), as the frustrated king alleged, but he was not a foolish man. His reasoned defence in 1340&#150;41 taught Edward a lesson he had the good sense never to forget.<br>
