<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bothmer,  Hans Kaspar <span class="st"> [Johann]</span>  von</span>, Count Bothmer in the nobility of the Holy Roman empire  (1656&#150;1732), <span class="occ">courtier and diplomat</span>, was born on 10 April 1656 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> in Lauenbr&uuml;ck, in the Celle portion of the duchy of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg, northern Germany, the eldest son of Julius August von Bothmer (1620&#150;1703), nobleman, and his wife, Margarethe Eleonore (1638&#150;1729), the daughter of Hans von Petersdorff and his wife, Anna Dorothea. Hans Bothmer's parents had eighteen children but only six of his younger brothers and one younger sister survived beyond infancy.<br>
<br>Bothmer was sent to St Michael's School in L&uuml;neburg in 1670, accompanied by his brother Rudolf Ulrich (1657&#150;1686). Another brother, Johann Friedrich (subsequently a general in the Hanoverian army), was sent to fight against Louis XIV of France in Alsace in 1674. Rudolf Ulrich was also allowed to join a regiment but, despite his request to follow his younger brothers to war, Bothmer's father insisted that he complete his education. In June 1676 Bothmer joined his father in Buxtehude in Bremen, where his father was in charge of the barracks.<br>
<br>In April 1677 Bothmer was suggested as a potential companion for Celle's envoy to the peace conference at Nijmwegen. He accepted this invitation and an offer of accompanying Lorenz M&uuml;ller, a privy councillor to Georg Wilhelm, duke of Celle, on a mission to London in October 1677. Bothmer was able to observe the celebrations for the marriage of William of Orange and Mary, later William III and Mary II. He saw Charles II in church and commented that &#145;the clothing of the preachers and the church ceremonies were nearly all catholic in style, the only difference being that they were sung in English rather than Latin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Erinnerungen</span>, 6).<br>
<br>During 1680 and 1681 Bothmer travelled in France and Holland. He then returned to the court of Georg Wilhelm in Celle and he was appointed as a gentleman of the household to Georg Wilhelm's daughter, Sophia Dorothea, when the latter married her first cousin Georg Ludwig in December 1682. The groom was heir to the dukedom of Calenberg (or Hanover) and ultimately elector of Hanover and, as George I, king of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Bothmer's first important diplomatic mission was to Copenhagen and Stockholm in the winter of 1683&#150;4. On 27 June 1684 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> Bothmer married Sophie Ehrengard von der Asseburg (1668&#150;1688), daughter of Christoph Christian von der Asseburg, in the Herrenhausen Palace, near Hanover. The marriage produced a son and a daughter, neither of whom reached adulthood. In 1685 Bothmer was sent as the diplomatic representative of both Celle and Calenberg to Berlin, where he remained until 1690. His wife died in Berlin in October 1688. From 1690 to 1696 Bothmer again served both Celle and Calenberg in Vienna.<br>
<br>Bothmer's father was raised to the rank of imperial <i>Freiherr</i> (baron) in November 1696. On 28 December 1696, in Dresden, Saxony, Bothmer married again. His second wife, Gisela Erdmuthe (1669&#150;1741), was the widow of Count Taube and the daughter of Ludwig Gebhard von Hoym and his wife, Katherina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Sch&ouml;nfeld. Bothmer and Gisela's daughter, Sophie Charlotte (1697&#150;1748), was twice married, first to Count Heinrich von Reuss (1696&#150;1722) and subsequently to Count Georg Wilhelm von Erbach (<i>d</i>. 1757); she was one of the wealthiest heiresses of her generation.<br>
<br>Bothmer's diplomatic career continued with a posting to The Hague. While there he undertook a number of special missions. He was an envoy to the congress of Ryswick (Rijswijk) in 1697 and in 1698 was sent to Paris to resume diplomatic relations between Celle and Louis XIV. A secondary aim of this mission was to win Louis's recognition for the new Hanoverian electorate, established by Emperor Leopold I in 1692, but not recognized by all European powers.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702 and the formation of the grand alliance, Bothmer's position in the Dutch republic became even more important for maintaining links between Celle and her military allies. After the union of Celle and Hanover on the death of Georg Wilhelm in 1705, Bothmer retained his post in the Dutch republic. Bothmer was also able to use his position at The Hague to keep an eye on events across the North Sea in Great Britain, and ensure that his new master's claim to the British and Irish thrones (established in England by the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>, 1701, and extended by the 1707 <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>) was not undermined. He maintained contacts with the leading whig supporters of the Hanoverian succession.<br>
<br>From 1711 Bothmer spent increasing amounts of time in London. Georg Ludwig of Hanover was worried about the prospect of a separate peace between Britain and France and the collapse of the grand alliance. Bothmer expressed Georg Ludwig's dissatisfaction at the potential peace to Anne. Bothmer could only protest against, not deflect, the treaty of Utrecht. He was, however, rewarded for his service to Hanover when he and his family were raised to the rank of <i>Reichsgraf</i> (imperial count) in November 1713. His role in London was enhanced in 1714, and he was present there during Anne's final illness (28 July &#150; 1 August 1714). He needed to be close to Kensington Palace, as he held one of the lists of George's proposed regents. The list, conveyed by Bothmer, was opened at a meeting of the privy council on 1 August 1714, within hours of Anne's death. Bothmer's contribution to the composition of the list has probably been overestimated but his local knowledge was undoubtedly useful to the new king.<br>
<br>Bothmer remained in London after 1714 as an adviser. He was part of a group, with Andreas Gottlieb von Bernstorff and John Robethon, known as the &#145;Hanoverian junto&#146;. It was claimed that this group sought to make excessive financial gains at Britain's expense, and that they pursued policies that were contrary to British interests. Bothmer was less willing than Bernstorff to argue with the king and remained more of the courtier and diplomat than forceful minister. Like Bernstorff, Bothmer attended many of the meetings connected with the attempts to bring peace to both southern and northern Europe through a series of alliances from 1716 to 1719. Bothmer had a more favourable disposition towards Prussia than Bernstorff. During 1719, when James, first Earl Stanhope, secretary of state for the northern department, was urging George to ally with Prussia, against Bernstorff's wishes, Bothmer wrote frequently to the British envoy in Berlin, Charles Whitworth, who was negotiating the alliance.<br>
<br>The supposed influence of the Hanoverian junto declined after 1720 and by 1724 Bothmer was complaining to Bernstorff, now in semi-retirement in Germany, that George no longer asked his British ministers to consult his German ministers over German affairs. Bothmer maintained good relations with a number of British diplomats. His broader Anglophilia can be seen in the castle he built at Bothmer, near Klutz in Mecklenburg, as his ancestral seat, between 1726 and 1732. The Hanoverian architect Johann Friedrich K&uuml;nnecke furnished Bothmer with a building that displays clear English and Dutch influences. In London Bothmer was resident from 1720 in the house that later became 10 Downing Street. He died there on 2 June 1732; in his will he requested that his body be buried in Germany.<br>
