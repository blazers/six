<span class="headword">Fergusson,  James</span>  (1769&#150;1842), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born in Ayr on 10 September 1769, the eldest son of James Fergusson jun. (1735&#150;1816), of Bank, and afterwards of Monkwood, Ayrshire, and Margaret Hutchison (1746&#150;1821). He studied in the University of Edinburgh in the 1780s, and was admitted an advocate on 5 July 1791. Fergusson married Mary Home (<i>d</i>. 1845), daughter of John Home of Bassendean, on 1 November 1806. Two daughters were born from the marriage. In 1809 Fergusson was appointed an advocate-depute, and on 4 March 1811 he became one of the four commissaries of Edinburgh. He held this office until he was appointed one of the principal clerks of session on 5 June 1826. To this last post he added that of keeper of the general register of entails, by 1830.<br>
<br>In 1806 Fergusson published <span class="italic">Letters upon the establishment of the volunteer corps and domestic military arrangements of Great Britain</span>. He himself held the office of major in a volunteer corps, and the pamphlet was concerned with the proper organization of the military to defend Britain from the threat of invasion. His <span class="italic">Observations upon the proposed reform in the administration of civil justice in Scotland</span> (1807) debated the controversial topic of the introduction of jury trial, then under consideration during the brief whig administration of Lord Grenville, and his <span class="italic">Observations upon the provisions of the bill presented to parliament relative to the trial in a separate tribunal of issues of fact arising in actions instituted before the supreme civil court of Scotland</span> (1824) dealt with the issue of the separate jury court created in 1816. These two publications showed his grasp of issues of procedure and indicated an independence of mind about the advantages of trial by jury. The second may have influenced his appointment as a principal clerk of session. Fergusson also published <span class="italic">Observations on entails, and entries of heirs apparent, cum beneficio inventarii, with an index of the register of Tailzies from <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1685 to 1830</span> (1830), and <span class="italic">Additional observations on entails &hellip; with an index of the register of tailzies &hellip; alphabetically arranged</span> (1831). These publications grew directly from his office as keeper.<br>
<br>Fergusson's most interesting publications, arising from his work as a commissary, were <span class="italic">Reports of some recent decisions by the consistorial courts of Scotland in actions of divorce</span> (1817), and <span class="italic">A treatise on the present state of the consistorial law in Scotland, with reports of decided cases</span> (1829). What inspired Fergusson in these works were the conflicts between Scots and English law over judicial dissolution of marriage on the grounds of adultery, which was possible in Scotland but not in England. These works exerted considerable influence on Joseph Story's discussion of conflicts of law in the area of family law in his great <span class="italic">Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws</span>, first published in Boston in 1834. Fergusson thus had an observable impact on the first treatise in English written on this important topic.<br>
<br>Fergusson sold his estate of Monkwood to his brother John H. Fergusson of Trochraigue. He died at his home, 40 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, on 3 May 1842, and was buried on 10 May at the new church, Greyfriars, Edinburgh.<br>
