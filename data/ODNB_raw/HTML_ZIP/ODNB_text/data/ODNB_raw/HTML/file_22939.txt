<span class="headword">Quain,  Jones</span>  (1796&#150;1865), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, born in November 1796, was the eldest son of Richard Quain of Ratheahy, co. Cork, and his first wife, whose maiden name was Jones. His grandfather was David Quain of Carrigoon, co. Cork. He received the name of Jones from his mother's family. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22940/', "Richard Quain (1800&#150;1887)")</script> was his full brother, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22938/', "Sir John Richard Quain (1816&#150;1876)")</script> his half-brother. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22941/', "Sir Richard Quain bt, FRS (1816&#150;1898)")</script>, was his first cousin. He commenced his education in Adair's school at Fermoy. He subsequently entered Trinity College, Dublin, where, in 1814, he obtained a scholarship, then the highest classical distinction. He graduated in arts, and in 1820 he took the degree of bachelor of medicine, though he did not proceed MD until 1833. At the end of his college career he visited the continental schools and spent some time in Paris working on <span class="italic">Manual of Pathology</span> (1826), a translation of the work by Louis Martinet.<br>
<br>Quain went to London in 1825 and joined, as one of its anatomical teachers, the school of medicine founded by Mr Tyrell in Aldersgate Street. The other teacher of anatomy was William Lawrence. While working here Quain prepared and published the <span class="italic">Elements of Descriptive and Practical Anatomy: for the Use of Students</span> (1828), which he introduced &#145;with a Paean of praise for the new French approach&#146;  (Desmond, 99). It became the standard textbook on the subject in all English speaking countries. It was also translated into German (1870&#150;72). An attack of haemoptysis occurring while he suffered from a dissection wound forced Quain to take a rest for two years.<br>
<br>In 1831 Quain accepted the post of professor of general anatomy at University College, then vacant by the resignation of Granville Sharp Pattison; Richard Quain, his brother, acted as senior demonstrator and lecturer on descriptive anatomy, while Erasmus Wilson was his prosecutor. He was also invited to lecture upon physiology. He resigned his post at University College in 1836, and in the same year he was appointed a member of the senate of the University of London. He lived in retirement during the last twenty years of his life, chiefly in Paris, devoting himself to literary and scientific pursuits. Quain died, unmarried, at his home, 103 Stanhope Street, Mornington Crescent, London, on 31 January 1865, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Quain was an elegant and accomplished scholar, and he was deeply interested in literature as well as science.<br>
