<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gingold,  Hermione Ferdinanda</span>  (1897&#150;1987), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in London on 9 December 1897, the elder daughter (there were no sons) of James Gingold, stockbroker, who had emigrated from Austria, and his wife, Kate Walter. She claimed Viennese, Turkish, and Romanian blood on her father's side. Her mother was Jewish.<br>
<br>La Gingold, or Herman or Toni, as she was often called in the theatre, first appeared on stage at the age of ten as the herald in <span class="italic">Pinkie and the Fairies</span>, produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. She later played the title role on tour and was cast by Tree as Falstaff's page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. In 1912, aged fifteen, she played Cassandra at Stratford upon Avon in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>, adventurously produced by William Poel. Edith Evans was Cressida. For an actress who was subsequently to achieve fame for her flamboyant personality, her wit, her sophisticated but often grotesque comedy, and her basso profundo voice, described by J. C. Trewin as &#145;powdered glass in deep syrup&#146;, her surprising billing in the actors' directory <span class="italic">Spotlight</span> in the 1920s and early 1930s read &#145;Shakespearean and soprano&#146;. She lost her high notes after suffering nodules on her vocal chords: &#145;One morning it was Mozart and the next &#147;Old Man River&#148;.&#146;<br>
<br>Gingold played many parts in the theatre and on radio in the 1930s; but she found her true m&eacute;tier in revue. She was in <span class="italic">Spread it Abroad</span> at the Saville in 1936, <span class="italic">The Gate Revue</span> in 1939 which transferred to the Ambassador's Theatre, and its sequel <span class="italic">Swinging the Gate</span> (1940). Her legendary partnership with Hermione Baddeley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39923/', "Baddeley, Hermione Youlanda Ruby Clinton (1906&#150;1986)")</script>] (&#145;the two Hermiones&#146;), which was shorter lived than memory usually allows, began at the Comedy Theatre in 1941 with <span class="italic">Rise above it</span> (two editions), and continued in <span class="italic">Sky High</span> at the Phoenix Theatre. It was during this show that their rivalry escalated in the press into a famous feud. She moved back to the Ambassador for <span class="italic">Sweet and Low</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Sweeter and Lower</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">Sweetest and Lowest</span> (1946). Gingold became a special attraction for American soldiers and &#145;Thanks, Yanks&#146; was one of her most appropriate numbers. During the astringent, name-dropping &#145;Sweet&#146; series she played 1676 performances, before 800,000 people, negotiating 17,010 costume changes.<br>
<br>Gingold followed with <span class="italic">Slings and Arrows</span> at the Comedy in 1948 and appeared in cameo roles in English films, notably in <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span> (1952), capturing a wider radio following with her weekly show <span class="italic">Home at Eight</span>, which featured Sid Colin's Addams-like family, the Dooms. However, in spite of success with Baddeley in 1949 in <span class="italic">Fallen Angels</span>, by No&euml;l Coward, achieved despite the author's disapproval of their overdoing the comic effects, she was determined to renew her American friendships. Her first significant appearance in New York was in John Murray Anderson's <span class="italic">Almanac</span> (Imperial, 1953). For the rest of her career she was based in America and became particularly well known on talk shows. She made other appearances in revue, and toured in a number of plays and musicals&#151;taking over from Jo Van Fleet the role of Madame Rose Pettle in Arthur Kopit's <span class="italic">Oh Dad, poor Dad, Mama's hung you in the closet and I'm feelin' so sad</span>. She made many cameo appearances on television and in films, notably <span class="italic">Around the World in Eighty Days</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Bell, Book and Candle</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">The Music Man</span> (1962). She joined the San Francisco Opera to play the Duchess of Crackenthorp in Donizetti's <span class="italic">La fille du r&eacute;giment</span> in 1975 and attacked the concert platform as a narrator.<br>
<br>There were two milestones in this period. Gingold appeared with Maurice Chevalier in the film <span class="italic">Gigi</span> (1958), in which they sang Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's song &#145;I remember it well&#146; with exquisite wit and pathos. In 1973 she played Madame Armfeldt in Stephen Sondheim's <span class="italic">A Little Night Music</span>, triumphing with &#145;Liaisons&#146;, the memoirs of a grande horizontale. Once again she reminded audiences of her gift for pathos and the power of her acting.<br>
<br>In 1977 Gingold took over the narrator's role in <span class="italic">Side by Side by Sondheim</span> on Broadway. Over eighty, she stayed with it gallantly on the gruelling &#145;bus and truck&#146; tour of one-night stands, travelling over 30,000 miles and visiting sixty cities until she tripped over an iron pole on Kansas City railway station in the small hours. A shattered knee and a dislocated arm effectively ended her performing career.<br>
<br>Hermione Gingold was an artist whose style and wit were unmistakable and who always held the promise of laughter and outrage. Adored as an icon and often underestimated as an actress, she is secure in her reputation as a queen of revue and one of the essential sights of London during the Second World War. She was a statuesque woman who exaggerated her gargoyle features for comic effect on the stage; but she could achieve a handsome aspect in repose.<br>
<br>In 1918 Gingold married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39029/', "Michael Joseph (1897&#150;1958)")</script>, publisher, the son of Moss Joseph, diamond merchant. They had two sons, the younger of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106199/', "Stephen Joseph")</script>, pioneer of theatre in the round in Scarborough, later Alan Ayckbourn's base, died in 1967. They were brought up by her husband. The marriage was dissolved in 1926, and in the same year she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38408/', "(Albert) Eric Maschwitz (1901&#150;1969)")</script>, playwright, lyricist, and television executive, son of Albert Arthur Maschwitz, of Edgbaston. The marriage was dissolved in 1940. Hermione Gingold died of pneumonia and heart disease in the Lennox Hill Hospital, New York, on 24 May 1987.<br>
