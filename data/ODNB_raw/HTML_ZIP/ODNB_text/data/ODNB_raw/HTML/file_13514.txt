<span class="headword">Holland,  Abraham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">poet</span>, a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13535/', "Philemon Holland (1552&#150;1637)")</script> and his wife, Anne (1555&#150;1627), daughter of William Bott, alias Peyton, was probably educated at the grammar school in Coventry, a school where his father was from 1608 an usher, in a town which Abraham's late epistle to him makes plain he had cause to be resentful of. He graduated BA in 1617 from Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Holland's first published work advertises him as a scholar of Trinity; it is an elaborate Latin elegy on Lord Harington, presumably written close to the time of its subject's death in February 1614, but not printed before Holland's brother Henry added it to his <span class="italic">Her&#333;ologia</span> in 1620, the last item in the first folio volume. His <span class="italic">Naumachia</span>, not printed until 1622, but again presumably written earlier, describes a sea battle in the overblown manner associated with Lucan; it comes with prose and verse dedications, in English and Latin, to George Gordon, earl of Enzie, a favourite of King James, educated with the princes Henry and Charles, and, to judge from other dedications, the focus of a dominantly Scots courtly literary culture. The earl's father, the Catholic marquess of Huntly, also merits a set of complimentary verses. Verses to the author from Drayton and others commend the poem for its early promise. The prefatory &#145;Caveat to his muse&#146;, announcing Holland's preference for &#145;cabinet&#146; poetry, nervously promotes this &#145;first Minerva&#146; of his &#145;brain&#146; and suggests he keeps darker verses in reserve.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Continued Inquisition Against Paper-Persecutors by A. H.</span>, appended to John Davies of Hereford's <span class="italic">Scourge for Paper-Persecutors</span> (which had appeared in 1611 as the <span class="italic">Scourge of Folly</span>), republished by Holland's brother Henry in 1625, is a satire on popular print culture. The <span class="italic">Posthuma</span>, printed supposedly at Cambridge (actually in London) at Henry's expense, collects pieces belonging to the year of the poet's death: a fulsome elegy on King James which welcomes the new King Charles; one more distinctive on Henry, earl of Oxford; a long poem on the London plague of 1625, like the <span class="italic">Naumachia</span> indebted to Lucan's manner but here, particularly in the prefatory &#145;Envoy&#146; to his friends in the country, informed by fine observation; an epistle to his sick father, Philemon, with a companion piece on his own sickness; and a miscellany of prose epistles (addressed to friends and relations) and meditations, verse translations of the psalms, and his own epitaph. The poems were marked as delivered to his brother by the dying poet on 18 February 1625 (that is, 1626), the day he died of the plague.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Naumachia</span>, with the sea battle now carefully identified as Lepanto, is reprinted in some copies of the <span class="italic">Posthuma</span>, and again in some copies of the 1632 edition of his father's translation of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Cyropaedia</span>. The poem on the plague from the <span class="italic">Posthuma</span> was reprinted under the title <span class="italic">London Looke-Backe</span>, along with related pieces by his brother Henry Holland and, from the previous century, by Thomas Phaer, as an appendix to <span class="italic">Salomon's Pest-House or Towre-Royall</span>, by J. D., &#145;Preacher of God's Word&#146;. Crum identifies as autograph the versions in Bodleian Library, MS Rawlinson poet. 83, folios 1&#150;4 and 5&#150;17, of the <span class="italic">Caveat</span> (under the title <span class="italic">L'Envoy</span>) and the <span class="italic">Naumachia</span> (fragmentary towards the end); and also the versions in Bodleian Library, MSS Ashmole 36, 37 (an assembly of unrelated items), folios 151 and 152, of &#145;To my honest father Mr Michael Drayton, and my new, yet loved freind [<i>sic</i>], Mr Browne&#146; and &#145;To Mrs E. F. in defence of a white blemish which lately grew in the sight of her ey [<i>sic</i>]&#146;, one of the few Cambridge poems later printed (but anonymously, and the address to &#145;E. F.&#146; cancelled) in Abraham Wright's <span class="italic">Parnassus Biceps</span> (1656, 16&#150;18). Newdigate (199) quotes from the manuscript poem to Drayton and Browne.<br>
