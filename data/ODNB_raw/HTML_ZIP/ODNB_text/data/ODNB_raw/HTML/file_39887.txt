<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trend,  Burke Frederick St John</span>, Baron Trend  (1914&#150;1987), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 2 January 1914 in Greenwich, London, the only child of Walter David St John Trend, journalist, and his wife, Marian Gertrude Tyers. He was educated at Whitgift School and at Merton College, Oxford. He obtained first classes in both classical honour moderations (1934) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1936).<br>
<br>In 1936 Trend passed into the civil service and was appointed to the Ministry of Education. A year later he was transferred to the Treasury, where he remained, with a brief interruption, for twenty-five years. His first years at the Treasury were spent on work relating to defence. In 1939, shortly after the outbreak of war, he became assistant private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, under Sir John Simon and Sir Kingsley Wood. In 1941, on promotion, Trend returned to dealing with the problems of defence equipment. After the war he again served the chancellor of the exchequer's private office as principal private secretary (1945&#150;9), first to Hugh Dalton and later to Sir Stafford Cripps. During this time the Treasury had the tasks of returning to peacetime levels of expenditure, carrying the reorganization of the civil service, and handling the Labour government's economic policies of Keynesianism and nationalization.<br>
<br>In 1949 Trend became an under-secretary at the Treasury and assumed responsibility for the home finance division, and in 1953 he moved to the central economic planning staff. His Treasury service was interrupted in 1955 for a year in the office of the lord privy seal, then R. A. Butler, followed by three years (1956&#150;9) as deputy secretary to the cabinet, the secretary to the cabinet then being Sir Norman Brook. Much of the day-to-day running of the affairs of the cabinet secretariat was Trend's responsibility. He returned to the Treasury in 1959 as third secretary and became second secretary a year later. On Brook's retirement at the end of 1962, he became secretary to the cabinet.<br>
<br>In this capacity Trend served under four prime ministers, Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, and Edward Heath, and proved himself a civil servant who ably gave an independent, balanced brief to his political masters regardless of their party colour. In particular he accepted responsibility for keeping them informed and advised on all nuclear matters, both civil and military, and maintained contacts on their behalf at the highest level with other governments involved. He also played a major part in organizing the Commonwealth conferences in conjunction with the cabinet secretaries of other member countries. His activities reflected Britain's position in the Commonwealth. He retired in 1973.<br>
<br>An interesting side to Trend's service in the Treasury is that from his early days he undertook the work of the accounting office for the secret vote. His responsibility was to secure value for money in expenditure on MI5 and MI6, but at the same time to ensure the safeguarding of these services. This experience was put to good use in 1974&#150;5, when Trend carried out an official investigation into allegations that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31249/', "Sir Roger Hollis")</script> had been an agent for the Soviet Union. He was unable to reach a definite decision.<br>
<br>In 1974 Trend became a life peer. Between 1973 and 1983 he was rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, and from 1975 to 1983 a pro-vice-chancellor of the university. He served as chairman of the trustees of the British Museum from 1979 to 1986 and was a member of the Advisory Council on Public Records (1974&#150;82). He died holding three other prominent offices: chairman of the managing trustees of the Nuffield Foundation (from 1980), president of the Royal Commonwealth Society (from 1982), and high bailiff of Westminster Abbey and searcher of the sanctuary (from 1983), where during the Second World War he had been a fire-watcher.<br>
<br>Trend had a formidable intellect which he used to penetrate at once to the heart of any problem. At the same time he possessed a constructive and positive approach, which could set out with absolute clarity the possible alternative courses of action in any given situation. His minutes of meetings recorded the proceedings and conclusions with precision and accuracy. He never gave the least indication to those present, either by word or by facial expression, of his personal views or feelings. Tall and serious, he responded to the humour of others but seldom followed it up with his own. Everyone who dealt with him knew that in all circumstances his conduct would undeniably be correct. If to some outsiders he may have appeared somewhat strait-laced in Whitehall, at Oxford it was apparent to everyone that he was thoroughly enjoying himself. With an unchallengeable academic record from his undergraduate years he could hold his own in any assembly. At the same time he was completely relaxed in the company of young people, stimulating them with his conversation and sharing his views with theirs. If in Whitehall it was sometimes said that Trend tended to be academic in his approach, at Oxford he was regarded as very much a man of the world.<br>
<br>Trend was appointed CVO (1953), CB (1955), KCB (1962), and GCB (1968). He was sworn of the privy council in 1972 and became an honorary fellow of Merton College in 1964. He was given honorary degrees by Oxford (DCL, 1969), St Andrews (LLD, 1974), and Loughborough (DLitt, 1984).<br>
<br>In 1949 Trend married Patricia Charlotte, daughter of the Revd Gilbert Shaw, by profession a barrister and later a priest. They had a daughter and two sons, one of whom, Michael, was elected MP for Windsor and Maidenhead at the general election of 1992. Trend died on 21 July 1987 at his London home, 102 Rochester Row. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 20 October 1987.<br>
