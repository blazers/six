<span class="headword">Stuart, Sir  Charles</span>  (1753&#150;1801), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Mary (1718&#150;1794), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19029/', "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19013/', "Edward Wortley Montagu")</script>, was born at Kenwood House, London, in January 1753. His siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64138/', "John Stuart, first marquess of Bute")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26727/', "William Stuart, archbishop of Armagh")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42015/', "Lady Louisa Stuart")</script>. He grew to be a strikingly handsome man, as appears in his portrait by George Romney. After schooling at home and at Dr Graffiani's academy in Kensington, he entered the army in 1768 as an ensign in the 37th foot; he purchased a lieutenancy in the 7th foot in 1770 and a captaincy in the 37th foot in 1773. He served with distinction in the war in America from 1775 to 1779 and was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 26th foot (Cameronians) in 1777. During his service in America he returned twice to England in 1778. On the first occasion, on 19 April he married Anne Louisa (1757&#150;1841), the second daughter and coheir of Lord Vere Bertie, MP, and his wife, Anne Casey. They had two sons, of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26698/', "Charles Stuart")</script>, became Baron Stuart de Rothesay. On the second occasion he was commissioned to inform the ministry of the army's plans. He was deeply critical of the conduct of the war by the army command and by Lord George Germain, the secretary of state, and he left America for good at the end of 1779, convinced that the American theatre of war was one &#145;where there is no honour to be obtained&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Prime Minister and his Son</span>, 162). Despite his criticisms of the high command, he won the confidence of General George Clinton, who offered him the post of adjutant-general and continued to correspond with him until the end of the war.<br>
<br>Stuart failed to obtain further military employment, probably because his father had become <i>persona non grata</i> with the king, and so he travelled extensively in Europe and sought, though without success, appointment to a diplomatic post abroad. His fierce pride and fiery temper, against which his father continually warned him, scarcely qualified him for the life of a diplomat. He was elected to parliament three times, for Bossiney in 1776, Ayr burghs in 1790, and Poole in 1796, but he took little part in parliamentary life. After his father's death in 1792 and Britain's declaration of war against France in 1793, George III agreed to his re-employment in the army. In April 1794 he was given command of the army in Corsica and with Nelson's help drove the French from Calvi, their last remaining stronghold on the island. His energy and bravery during the siege won him the admiration of Sir John Moore, who served as his second in command. Unfortunately he quarrelled with Admiral Lord Hood, who commanded the Mediterranean Fleet, over the conduct of the siege, and later with Sir Gilbert Elliot, viceroy of Corsica. His unwillingness to take orders from a civilian (albeit a viceroy), his siding with the Corsican patriot General Pasquale Paoli in disputes with Elliot, and his conviction that Corsica could be ruled only by a military man led to his resignation of his command in February 1795.<br>
<br>In January 1797 Stuart was given command of a force sent to Portugal at the urgent request of the Portuguese government, threatened with invasion by France and Spain. There he succeeded in transforming his army, made up partly of foreign troops who lacked discipline and motivation, into a very effective force. The foreign regiments later fought in Egypt and there &#145;displayed a steadiness and resolution which spoke volumes for what Charles Stuart's influence had done&#146;  (Atkinson, 138). In 1798 he received a commission to capture Minorca from the Spanish with a force of 3000 men drawn mostly from Gibraltar. His appointment received the approval of the British admiral Lord St Vincent, who told the secretary of state that Stuart was &#145;the best general you have &hellip; no man can manage Frenchmen so well and the British will go to hell for him&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Prime Minister and his Son</span>, 284). He succeeded in capturing Minorca from a numerically superior enemy in November 1798 without the loss of a single man. In recognition he was created knight of the Bath and governor of Minorca. He radically reformed the island's administration, bringing about changes described by a French historian as &#145;the most important ever effected in a country which had not been ceded by treaty&#146;  (Lameire, 703).<br>
<br>While in Minorca Stuart responded at once to a plea by Nelson to send troops to Messina to preserve Sicily from a French invasion. Nelson had the highest opinion of Stuart, whom he described as an officer who &#145;by his abilities would make a bad army into a good one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 3.226). Stuart accompanied two regiments to Messina and then paid a fleeting visit to Malta, where the French still held out in Valletta. He reported to Pitt that, contrary to the views of other senior officers, Valletta could be reduced only by continuing with the naval blockade. Ill health compelled him to return to England, where he was immediately offered command of an army in the Mediterranean, to operate in Italy in conjunction with the Austrians. Disagreements with the duke of York, the commander-in-chief, and with government ministers over the size and composition of this army, and over the ministry's commitment to allow a Russian garrison into Malta when the French garrison eventually surrendered, resulted in his resignation in April 1800. He was then offered the important post of commander-in-chief of the army in Ireland, but before he could accept it he died, on 25 March 1801, at his home, the Thatched House, Richmond Park, Surrey. He was buried in the family vault at Petersham. There is a monument to him by Nollekens in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Stuart was a brilliant and courageous soldier but a difficult subordinate. Fortescue has described him as a man of rare talent both as administrator and commander, &#145;the greatest of all the British officers of the period&#146;, and to be compared with Wellington  (Fortescue, <span class="italic">Brit. army</span>, 4, 2.77). But Stuart was too arrogant, too contemptuous of the views of politicians, and too liable to quarrel with other commanders, whether naval or military, to have done the work that Wellington was later to do in Spain and Portugal. As the duke of York told George III on Stuart's resignation in 1800: &#145;I can only regret that Sir Charles Stuart's unfortunate jealousy of temper and impatience of controul from any superior authority preclude the possibility of taking advantage of his otherwise excellent talents&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.337).<br>
