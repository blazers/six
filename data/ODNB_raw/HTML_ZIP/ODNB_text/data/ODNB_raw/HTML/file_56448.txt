<span class="headword">Ympyn,  Jan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1540), <span class="occ">merchant and author of a text on double entry accounting</span>, was born in the Low Countries (but not in Antwerp), the son of Christoffel Ympens, a merchant. He was sent to Italy to work and to learn commercial practices, spending twelve years there, mostly in Venice where he studied and practised double entry. He also travelled in Spain and Portugal. There is no record that he ever visited England. In 1519 he returned to the Low Countries, settling in Antwerp, of which he became a citizen and a member of the Mercers' Guild. He prospered as a retailer and wholesaler, importer, and exporter, of silks, woollens, and tapestries, and owned several properties. About 1525 he married Anna Swinters; there were three children. He died in Antwerp in 1540, between 12 August and October.<br>
<br>Ympyn is remembered today for his posthumous treatise on double entry accounting, <span class="italic">Nieuwe instructie ende bewijs der looffelijcker consten des rekenboecks</span> (Antwerp, 1543), which was translated into French as <span class="italic">Nouvelle instruction et remonstration de la tresexcellente science du livre de compte</span> (Antwerp, 1543), and into English as <span class="italic">A notable and very excellente woorke, expressyng and declaryng the maner and forme how to kepe a boke of accomptes or reconynges</span> (London, 1547). The Dutch and French versions, which were published under the supervision of his widow, are the earliest texts on accounting in their respective languages. The English version of Ympyn, almost certainly printed by Richard Grafton, is the oldest extant text on accounting in English. Its title-page states that it has been translated &#145;with greate Diligence out of the Italian toung into Dutche, and out of Dutche, into French and now out of French into Englishe&#146;. The text of Ympyn's book is in many places close to that of the first published exposition of double entry, in Luca Pacioli's <span class="italic">Summa di arithmetica</span> (1494), but is a substantial improvement on it, with rearrangements, additions, and omissions. Unlike Pacioli's text an illustrative set of account books, probably based on Ympyn's own business, is appended, although this is missing in the only known surviving copy of the English version (held in the Lenin Library, Moscow).<br>
<br>The title-page of the journal (account book) of Sir Thomas Gresham, begun on 26 April 1546, follows very closely the title-page of the illustrative journal of the French version of Ympyn. This strongly suggests that Gresham, who was resident in Brussels in 1543, was familiar with Ympyn's book. It has been further suggested that it was he who translated it from French into English, but this has not been proved. More certainly, Ympyn influenced James Peele's <span class="italic">The Maner and Fourme how to Kepe a Perfect Reconyng</span>, printed by Grafton in 1553, and the chapter on merchant's accounts in Gerard Malynes's <span class="italic">Lex Mercatoria</span> (1622). Peele's book in its turn was an influence on John Mellis's <span class="italic">A Briefe Instruction</span> (1588) which is mainly a revision of Hugh Oldcastle's <span class="italic">Profitable Treatyce</span> of 1543. It is because Oldcastle's book survives only through Mellis that the English translation of Ympyn is the oldest extant text in English on double entry.<br>
