<span class="headword">Yorke,  Philip</span>  (1743&#150;1804), <span class="occ">genealogist and writer</span>, was born on 30 July 1743 at Erddig, near Wrexham, Denbighshire, the son of Simon Yorke (1696&#150;1767), landowner, and his wife, Dorothy (1717&#150;1787), daughter and heir of Matthew Hutton of Newnham, Hertfordshire. His grandfather, Simon Yorke, was uncle of Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke. His early education was at a preparatory school in Wanstead and at Dr Henry Newcome's private academy in Hackney. After two terms at Eton College, where he met Brownlow Cust, his future brother-in-law, Philip was admitted a fellow commoner of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1762, and was created MA in 1765. He was also admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 4 November 1762 and was called to the bar on 4 July 1767. In 1768 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1770 Yorke married Elizabeth (1749&#150;1779), the daughter of Sir John Cust, and they had two daughters and five sons. Through his wife's interest he obtained a seat in parliament for the Cornish borough of Helston, in the place of a member disqualified by order of the House of Commons (October 1774), and he retained this seat until he retired in 1781. Subsequently he sat for Grantham from 17 January 1792 until 7 January 1793, when he stood down in favour of his son Simon. Although he was something of an amateur actor and was remembered by contemporaries for his talent for conversation, he never spoke in the House of Commons, owing to a &#145;constitutional diffidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 250). He also captained the Denbighshire regiment of militia, although he seems to have been a somewhat reluctant soldier.<br>
<br>Although Yorke initially had &#145;no great respect for the mountain Welsh, great or small&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>, 1111), his attitude began to change after his marriage in 1782 to a Welsh woman, Diana (1748&#150;1805), daughter of Piers Wynne of Dyffryn Aled and widow of Ridgeway Owen Meyrick. The couple had two daughters and four sons. In his later years he turned his attention to Welsh history and genealogy, including his wife's descent from Marchudd, lord of Uwch Dulas. In 1795 he issued seventy copies of his <span class="italic">Tracts of Powys</span>, a genealogical history of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, including a refutation of Polydore Virgil's critical views of the ancient Britons. The dedication, to Thomas Pennant of Downing, was dated Erddig, 20 April 1795. An appendix contained interesting letters from Lewis Morris to William Vaughan and others. In a revised and expanded form this work was reissued in 1799 as <span class="italic">The Royal Tribes of Wales</span>, a valuable brief account of the five regal tribes, with much interesting information on their distinguished descendants. The text owed much to the assistance of the Revd Walter Davies 
    (Gwallter Mechain; 1764&#150;1849)
  , although the relative contribution of each is now difficult to determine. The illustrative portraits were drawn by J. Allen and engraved by W. Bond.<br>
<br>Yorke's genealogical works indicate that he at first largely accepted the Welsh origin myth and gave credence to the Trojan roots of the people, but that later he distanced himself from this traditionally held viewpoint. He had the intention of producing a biography of Wales, but he was unable to bring this scheme to fruition. Yorke died on 19 March 1804 at his seat of Erddig Park, Wrexham, and was buried at Marchwiel. He was succeeded by Simon Yorke (1771&#150;1834), his eldest son from his first marriage.<br>
<br>Although contemporary accounts portrayed him as a rather extravagant country squire, Yorke was a prudent and meticulous landowner and did much to improve his seat of Erddig Park (which passed into the ownership of the National Trust in the twentieth century). Having made the most of his education, he became in later life a fervent Welsh patriot and, despite his English roots, made a learned contribution to the field of Welsh genealogy.<br>
