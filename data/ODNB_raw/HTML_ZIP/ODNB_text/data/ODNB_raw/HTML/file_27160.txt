<span class="headword">Theakston,  Joseph</span>  (1772&#150;1842), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Spurriergate, York, and was baptized on either 14 December 1772 or 21 December 1772 in St Michael's, Spurriergate, the son of John and Sarah Theakston of York. His father having died while he was still a child, his mother apprenticed him in 1786 to John Fisher the elder, a local sculptor. In 1794 he completed his apprenticeship, moved to London, and became a pupil of John Bacon the elder, whose work exerted upon him a formative stylistic influence. He then spent several years working as an assistant to John Flaxman and Edward Hodges Baily. From 1818 until his death twenty-four years later he was employed by Francis Chantrey to carve the draperies and other accessories of the latter's statues and groups.<br>
<br>Although his individual contributions to Chantrey's works are mostly unrecorded, Theakston's dominant role in the execution of two colossal stone statues of George Granville Leveson-Gower, first duke of Sutherland, from small models by Chantrey, is actually recorded: the first (1834&#150;6) stands on the duke's estate at Trentham Park, Staffordshire, and the second (1836&#150;8), height (including base) <i>c</i>.106 ft, is on Ben Bragghie, Golspie, Sutherland. (The one in Scotland is signed &#145;Theakston Fab. Chantrey Auct.&#146;.) Theakston's contemporary reputation is well summed up in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>:<blockquote>He was perhaps the ablest drapery and ornamental carver of his time, as he was certainly the most rapid &hellip; few could imagine the rapidity of his execution from his quiet manner of handling his tools &hellip; When he began to carve a statue, he knew perfectly well what was required of him, and cut away the superfluous marble at once. He had not to try again and again, like most other artists &hellip; he may be said never to have struck the chisel with the hammer in vain. (25 April 1842)</blockquote>As Peter Cunningham, the son of Chantrey's foreman and secretary Allan Cunningham, put it: &#145;He was a consummate master in making marble convey the qualities and surfaces of silks and satins, velvets and ermines&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 14 Feb 1863). Besides assisting Chantrey, he produced busts and monumental and ornamental works of his own, and exhibited occasionally at the Royal Academy from 1809 to 1837. In 1829 he was paid &pound;1000 for a sculptured marble chimney-piece and clock-frame for the grand hall in Buckingham Palace. Joseph Theakston died where he had lived at 9 Belgrave Place, London, on 14 April 1842, aged sixty-nine, and was buried on the 21st alongside his wife at Kensal Green cemetery in London.<br>
