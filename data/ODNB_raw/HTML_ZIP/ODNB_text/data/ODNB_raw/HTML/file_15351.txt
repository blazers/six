<span class="headword">Kendall,  John</span>  (1768/9&#150;1829), <span class="occ">architect and stonemason</span>, was the youngest of four children of Edward Kendall (<i>d</i>. 1796) of Exeter, monumental sculptor and mason, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1738, <i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of James and Elizabeth Rennel of Kingsteignton. He probably attended Exeter grammar school with his elder brother William (1767&#150;1832), later praised as a poet, amateur architect, and local philanthropist. Kendall's interest in medieval architecture and his practical skills as a craftsman owed much to his father, who had been employed as stonemason to Exeter Cathedral since 1766. The family's separate statuary business provided Kendall's first commissions: he designed and carved funeral monuments for the cathedral from 1791, and continued until his last years. On Edward Kendall's death in November 1796 John was appointed stonemason to Exeter Cathedral.<br>
<br>On 30 July 1798 Kendall married Grace Luxmore (<i>bap</i>. 1770) of Okehampton. Seven daughters and one son, John Henry (later vicar of Treneglos, Cornwall), were born between 1799 and 1809. Kendall's large young family and the chapter's annual settlement of accounts probably contributed to his bankruptcy in 1811. Soon at work again, he embarked on a major expansion of the cathedral restoration programme that had begun with repairs to the west front in 1805. Fifteen years of hectic activity followed on the cathedral surveyor's 1812 report describing Exeter's crumbling structure. From then until 1827 Kendall prepared plans and estimates and personally carried out all the main stonework repairs. Decayed pinnacles, parapets, windows, and buttresses were restored or replaced, many of the west front image screen figures repaired or reinstated. The restored chapter house became the cathedral library's new home and the lady chapel, freed of books, was returned to its proper use. It was, however, Kendall's new Gothic reredos, erected in 1818 (removed by Sir George Gilbert Scott) that was commended by contemporary visitors as his finest achievement. His similar screen (1821) at Haccombe church, Devon, survives. Kendall followed in the tradition of the medieval master masons, combining the skills of designer and builder. Some of his detailed drawings of the cathedral interior (1805&#150;6) he later used as illustrations for his treatise <span class="italic">An Elucidation of the Principles of English Architecture, Usually Denominated Gothic</span> (1818). Of his designs prepared for the dean and chapter, only his 1818 design for the new reredos has survived.<br>
<br>After a protracted illness Kendall died on 24 September 1829, aged sixty, at Longbrook Street, Exeter, where he lived; he was buried on 29 September in St David's churchyard, Exeter. His wife survived him.<br>
