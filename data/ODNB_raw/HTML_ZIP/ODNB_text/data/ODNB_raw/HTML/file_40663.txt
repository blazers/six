<span class="headword">Cutner,  Solomon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Solomon]</span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was born on 9 August 1902 at 39 Fournier Street, in the East End of London, the youngest in the family of four sons and three daughters of Harris Cutner (formerly Schneiderman), master tailor, the grandson of a Polish &eacute;migr&eacute; from Cutnow, and his wife, Rose Piser. Showing exceptional musical talent from early childhood, at the age of seven he came to the attention of Mathilde Verne, a fashionable London piano teacher and former pupil of Clara Schumann. She persuaded Solomon's parents to sign a contract, relinquishing him into her care for five years, and within a year she had launched him successfully as a child prodigy, with a d&eacute;but at the Queen's Hall in June 1911, playing Mozart's &#145;Little B[flat]&#146; concerto, the slow movement of Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto, and a polacca by Alice Verne. The concert was conducted by Theodor M&uuml;ller-Reuter, another of Clara Schumann's pupils. Billed from the outset as Solomon, sometimes wearing a sailor suit, sometimes in velvet knickerbockers and a lace collar, he captivated his audiences. He was invited to play at Buckingham Palace in 1912, and he made his Proms d&eacute;but in 1914 playing Beethoven's second piano concerto.<br>
<br>After Solomon had spent five miserable years with Mathilde Verne, forced to practise for many hours a day in a locked room, his parents refused to sign another contract, and for a year he gave concerts throughout England chaperoned by one of his brothers. In 1916 he decided to give up all public performances, and, after a farewell recital at the Wigmore Hall shortly before his fourteenth birthday, he began studying with Dr Simon Rumschisky in London, while attending King Alfred School in the North End Road in the mornings. His studies were financed through a fund set up by an American, Mrs Colson. He spent three years with Rumschisky, a medical doctor who had studied the physiological aspects of playing the piano. Solomon later claimed that he was one of the greatest teachers in the world, and had taught him all his technique. In 1919, financed by Mrs Colson, Solomon went to Paris, where his teachers included Lazare L&eacute;vy, Marcel Dupr&eacute;, and Alfred Cortot.<br>
<br>Still only nineteen, Solomon returned to the concert platform with a Wigmore Hall recital in 1921. The 1920s were difficult years for him, for English audiences then preferred foreign pianists such as Artur Schnabel. Although he toured the USA in 1926 he remained relatively unknown outside England. Thanks to Sir Henry Wood he performed regularly at the Queen's Hall Promenade Concerts. Sir Arthur Bliss wrote his viola sonata (1933) for Solomon and Lionel Tertis, and when Solomon was asked by the British Council to represent Great Britain at the New York World Fair in 1939 he commissioned Bliss to write a piano concerto. During the Second World War Solomon joined the Entertainments National Service Association and gave many concerts, both for troops abroad and in army camps and hospitals at home, making many converts to classical music. Through his concerts on the wards at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, he came into contact with Sir Alexander Fleming, and was successfully treated for a septic thumb through the inhalation of penicillin in the very early days of its development as an antibiotic.<br>
<br>After the war Solomon became an international celebrity, following an enthusiastic reception in the USA on his tour in 1949. He spent the next few years touring and recording, before a stroke ended his career in 1956. He was left with an active brain, but a speech impediment. Though he struggled to express himself, his playing days were over. In the remaining years of his life he could take no interest in his career, achievements, or recordings.<br>
<br>Solomon was one of the three greatest English pianists of the twentieth century, with Dame Myra Hess and Sir Clifford Curzon, and possibly the greatest twentieth-century British interpreter of Schumann. During his early career he was best known for his performances of Chopin, but he later concentrated on Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, and Brahms. Critics commented on the elegance and purity of his playing, its clarity and accuracy, and the controlled nature of his performances. Famous recordings from the early 1950s include those of the Brahms <span class="italic">Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel</span>, Beethoven's &#145;Moonlight&#146; sonata, the two Brahms piano concertos, and Schumann's <span class="italic">Carnaval</span>. He also played chamber music, recording the Beethoven cello sonatas with Gregor Piatigorsky, and he formed a trio with Zino Francescatti and Pierre Fournier for the 1955 Edinburgh festival.<br>
<br>Solomon was short and stocky, almost completely bald from an early age, with short, thick fingers. He displayed none of the temperamental behaviour usually associated with great artists, and despite his years of adulation as a child prodigy he developed into a charming and modest person, nicknamed Solo by Walter Legge, manager for artists and repertory at the Gramophone Company. He had a passion for betting and gambling, possibly originating in his trips to the races with the elderly mother of his landlady while he was studying in Paris, and he loved to visit the casinos in Cannes and Monte Carlo. He enjoyed bridge and golf, and for years played tennis daily with his old friend Gerald Moore.<br>
<br>Solomon was appointed CBE in 1946 for his wartime work. He had honorary degrees from Cambridge (MusD, 1974) and St Andrews (LLD, 1960). On 15 October 1970 he married, after a long relationship begun in 1927, a former pupil, Gwendoline Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), daughter of Patrick Byrne, an Irish doctor and surgeon. They had not married earlier because Solomon was an Orthodox Jew and Gwendoline a gentile. They had no children. Solomon died on 22 February 1988 in London.<br>
