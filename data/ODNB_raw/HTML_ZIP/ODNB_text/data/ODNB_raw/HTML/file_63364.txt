<span class="headword">Wallace family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1841&#150;1925), <span class="occ">merchants</span>, came to prominence with the sons of Lewis Alexander Wallace (1789&#150;1861), builder and merchant of Edinburgh, and his wife, Isabella Clerk. The couple had six sons and five daughters. In the late eighteenth century Lewis Wallace's father, William Wallace, had established William Wallace &amp; Co., leading builders and architects, which participated notably in the building of Edinburgh's New Town. A director of the National Bank of Scotland, Lewis Wallace lived in comfortable circumstances in Regent Terrace in the New Town, in a house he had designed and built himself. However, like numerous Scottish businessmen he recognized greater opportunities in employing his capital in international trade, especially that centred on India and the East. Thus in 1841 he provided J. G. Frith, a merchant recently returned from India, with capital for the development of a merchant business in London linked to Frith's well-established business in Bombay. Lewis's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_63347"></a><span class="headword">William Wallace</span>  (1818&#150;1888), born in Edinburgh on 24 March 1818, joined Frith &amp; Co. of Bombay in 1841. In due course all the sons were to follow in William's footsteps and forsake the family's Edinburgh connections.<br>
<br>In 1844 William, who apparently disliked India, returned to establish, with Frith, the London firm of Frith, Wallace &amp; Co., East India merchants. Acting in tandem with the Bombay house this became a major London agency firm and survived as Wallace Brothers until the 1980s. Almost all the brothers made significant and diverse contributions to its success, but William and his siblings Lewis and Alexander played the most important roles in a family firm where relationships were especially close-knit. After William's return the third son, <a name="cosubject_63348"></a><span class="headword">Lewis Alexander Wallace</span>  (1821&#150;1906), went out aged twenty-seven to join the Bombay partnership, which in 1848 was reformed as Wallace &amp; Co.; it specialized not just in merchanting but in the provision of shipping agency services, and it acted as financial agents for the Ceylon government and, of increasing importance, imported Lancashire textiles. Born on 20 September 1821, Lewis emerged as a major figure in Bombay's business community, beginning an important family connection through his directorship and later chairmanship of the Commercial Bank of India. In 1850 he was joined as a partner by the fourth son, George. Subsequently both returned to become partners in London and were replaced in Bombay by their three other brothers, Alexander, Robert, and Richard.<br>
<br>William, having participated in the establishment of a viable business in London, returned to India in 1853 and set about establishing connections with Burma. In either 1856 or 1857 he went there as the Bombay firm's representative to purchase teak for India's fast-expanding railways. Using the Bombay firm's capital he established William Wallace &amp; Co., timber merchants and shipbuilders, at Rangoon and Moulmein, and purchased land. In 1862 he travelled to Mandalay to negotiate with King Mindon for the lease of teak forests in northern Burma and his firm became a major shipper of Burma teak around the world. The business rapidly diversified as other opportunities were recognized, but the extent of the investment drained the Bombay firm's resources&#151;a major point of friction between William, who had a reputation for determination and impatience, and his brothers.<br>
<br>At the end of 1862 the two brothers then resident in London, Lewis and George, broke with their non-family partners and established Wallace Brothers &amp; Co. with &pound;100,000 capital. At the same time Alexander reorganized the Bombay business and thus family control was consolidated in their two interlocking partnerships. These were already of considerable size as the first balance sheet of the London firm totalled more than &pound;450,000. This manoeuvre was followed by the equally significant transfer in 1863 of the family's Burma assets to a newly formed, publicly owned company registered in India, the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd, in exchange for a large and lucrative shareholding. By the 1880s it was the largest business in Burma and acted as a major force for the country's modernization and for the extension of British economic imperialism. It was dominated by the Wallaces, who acted as its &#145;perpetual&#146; secretaries, treasurers, and managers through to the 1950s.<br>
<br>The youngest of the brothers, <a name="cosubject_48951"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Falconer Wallace</span>  (1836&#150;1925), was the guiding hand in Bombay behind this innovative and immensely successful transaction which removed many of the risks faced by the London and Bombay firms while ensuring for them a lucrative commission income. Born on 30 June 1836, he first went out to Bombay in 1856. He became the corporation's first chairman and emerged as a major business figure at Bombay and a worthy successor there to William and Lewis. William was to play no part in the new company's affairs, but retired from business, aged forty-six, on his return to London in 1864; for most of the rest of his life he lived at the Union Club. Little is known about him in retirement. He never married but in Burma had an illegitimate child whom he supported through remittances to Rangoon. He died on 28 January 1888 at 29 Hyde Park Place, London, leaving his estate to Lewis and Alexander.<br>
<br>Alexander himself left for England in 1867, and from then on the day-to-day management was in the hands of local partners; none of the brothers were to return to India. Shortly after his return, on 25 February 1868 Alexander married Katharine Louisa, daughter of William Harter of Hope Hall, Eccles; they had a son and a daughter. Alexander then moved to Manchester to supervise, along with his brother Robert, the family's interests there, as an important part of its business was the export of Lancashire textiles to India. After a decade running Wallace &amp; Co. (formed in 1864), Alexander moved back to London, to assist in the management of the London house.<br>
<br>Under the direction of Lewis and Alexander (as joint senior partners), the London business went from strength to strength. Lewis, in his sixties, was concerned with financial and investment matters and Alexander, fifteen years younger, with expansion into new ventures; they enjoyed &#145;a complete and perfect confidence&#146; in one another  (Pointon, <span class="italic">Wallace Brothers</span>, 50). From the 1880s Alexander&#151;energetic, alert, shrewd, and the most entrepreneurial of all the brothers&#151;led the family and Bombay Burmah businesses in new directions, ranging from the importation of kerosene into India to the extension of the teak business to Siam, and from oil prospecting in Sumatra to the ownership of rubber plantations. Very often these new interests were carried on through the establishment of new companies controlled by the Wallaces. However, the core of the family firm's business continued to be in timber, and the trade of textiles and other exports and imports.<br>
<br>Alexander's growing reputation in the City was confirmed in 1887 through his appointment to the Bank of England's court; he served as a director for thirty-one years and was governor between 1905 and 1907. By the end of the 1880s the size of their business meant that both brothers had withdrawn from managing day-to-day transactions and were focusing instead upon policy and strategy. A sign of this withdrawal was their acquisition in the 1890s of estates at Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, Lewis through the lease of Castle Newe and Alexander through the purchase of Candacraig, though both had possessed country houses in England prior to this.<br>
<br>Lewis died on 9 September 1906, aged eighty-five, at Castle Newe. Throughout his life he had devoted himself single-mindedly to Wallace's affairs and had purposefully avoided charitable and committee work. He never married. Although still a partner at his death, a few years earlier he had handed his duties as senior to his brother. It was Alexander who in 1911 oversaw the London firm's conversion to a limited company and who was its first chairman and major shareholder. Alexander died on 24 January 1925 at 20 Hyde Park Gardens, London. By this time the family's influence had waned, if only because of a shortage of male heirs produced by the six founding brothers. The firm was finally acquired by Standard Chartered Bank.<br>
