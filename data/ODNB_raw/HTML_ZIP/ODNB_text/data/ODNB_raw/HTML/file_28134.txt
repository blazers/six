<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  John</span>  (1603&#150;1674), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 14 September 1603 at Trawscoed, Cardiganshire, the eldest of the eight children of Edward Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1635), esquire, and Lettice, daughter of John Stedman, Strata Florida, Cardiganshire. In 1625 he married Jane Stedman (<i>d</i>. 1680) of Cilcennin, Cardiganshire. Vaughan was educated at the King's School, Worcester (1613&#150;18), and at Christ Church, Oxford (1618&#150;21), though he did not graduate. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1621, was called to the bar in 1630, and became a bencher in 1660. It was in the Star Chamber that he first made his name. In 1628 he entered the Commons as member for Cardigan borough and would represent it again in the Short and Long parliaments. Like Edward Hyde, he opposed the extraordinary measures adopted during the period of Charles I's personal rule. He helped to prepare charges against Laud and to fashion the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>, but although he participated in the early proceedings against Strafford he drew the line at attainder, as being unconstitutional. Hyde, the future earl of Clarendon, with whom he was then friendly, later said that Vaughan was &#145;without inclination to any change of government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.31). In short he was a constitutional royalist, and so remained.<br>
<br>Vaughan returned home before the outbreak of the civil war. Marriage settlements and the purchase of eight Cardiganshire granges, formerly belonging to the dissolved monastery of Strata Florida, led to a perceptible increase in the annual rental of the Trawscoed estate, estimated to be about &pound;1200 before his death. In an economically poor county he was thus regarded as one of the leading gentry. At first he loyally supported the royalists. The fall of Tenby in March 1643 disturbed him and he was soon placing some order upon the undisciplined Cardiganshire trained bands. Reprisals followed. In January 1645 his house was totally plundered and in September he was disabled from sitting in parliament. The assertion that he helped parliamentary forces to capture Aberystwyth Castle cannot be corroborated and only his own testimony records that he compounded for his estate. When the Cromwellian government encouraged moderate men to return to public life Vaughan refused even to exercise his profession. Vaughan seldom emerged during these turbulent years into the clear light of day, leading Clarendon to the reasonable conclusion that he lived &#145;as near an innocent life as the iniquity of that time would permit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.31).<br>
<br>Vaughan represented Cardiganshire in the Cavalier Parliament from 1661 to 1668. His silver-tongued eloquence was widely admired. In praising Sir Thomas Littleton, Pepys declared that he was &#145;the usual second to the great Vaughan&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 7.210). He opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>, expressly desired by the king. In the 1668 dispute concerning Thomas Skinner he may justly be regarded as the architect of the victory of the Commons over the Lords, who henceforth abandoned all attempts to exercise original jurisdiction in civil cases when the parties were commoners. As a debater he is best remembered for his sustained attack on Clarendon who, he was now convinced, was a menace to constitutional government.<br>
<br>Vaughan was knighted on 20 May 1668 and sworn chief justice of the court of common pleas on 23 May. His presidency preceded the period when party faction influenced judicial appointments. He defended the court of common pleas against the jurisdiction of the courts of king's bench, chancery, and Admiralty. His authoritative opinion helped to preserve the Welsh court of great sessions from the encroachment of the Westminster courts until its extinction in 1831. In <i>Thomas v. Sorrell</i> (1674) he showed that an act of parliament could not be suspended except by legislative power. His fame chiefly rests upon <i>Bushell's case</i> (1670). Edward Bushell was a member of the jury fined for persistently acquitting the Quakers William Penn and William Mead for holding an unlawful assembly. Bushell, imprisoned for refusal to pay, sued out a writ of habeas corpus which was returned to the court of common pleas. Vaughan demonstrated beyond doubt that jurors, not the judge, are to decide questions of fact. Ever since <i>Bushell's case</i> juries who have honestly felt that they could not follow the direction of a judge have retired to consider their verdict under the full protection of Vaughan's historic judgment, and his name is appropriately included on a plaque in the Old Bailey which commemorates the endurance of Bushell and his fellow jurors. Lord Campbell considered him to be a &#145;really consummate common law judge&#146;  (J. Campbell, <span class="italic">Lives of the Chief Justices</span>, 3, 1857, 2).<br>
<br>Occasionally said to be aloof and opinionated, Vaughan was nevertheless much esteemed by a constellation of able men. John Selden dedicated to him his <span class="italic">Vindiciae &hellip; Marie Clausi</span> (1653) and Vaughan was one of the executors of his splendid library at length placed in the &#145;Selden end&#146; of the Bodleian Library. John Evelyn thought him &#145;a very wise and learned person&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 514). Matthew Hale loved to converse with Vaughan, his Acton neighbour, while Aubrey records that Thomas Hobbes delighted to visit Vaughan, his &#145;great acquaintance&#146;, thrice weekly  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.369). Vaughan died on 10 December 1674 at Serjeants' Inn and was buried twelve days later in the Temple Church where the latitudinarian Edward Stillingfleet paid him high tribute. His only son, Edward, briefly a lord commissioner for the Admiralty, published his father's <span class="italic">Reports</span> in 1677 and a corrected version in 1706.<br>
