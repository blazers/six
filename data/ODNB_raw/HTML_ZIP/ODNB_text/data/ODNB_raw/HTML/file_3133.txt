</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Richard</span>, first earl of Cork  (1566&#150;1643), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, was born at Preston, near Faversham in Kent, on 13 October 1566, the second son of Roger Boyle (<i>d</i>. 1576), landowner, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Robert Naylor. Roger Boyle, a cadet of a Herefordshire family, was able to send his eldest sons to Cambridge. Richard went from King's School in Canterbury to Corpus Christi College in 1583. His studies were continued at the Middle Temple, where he attached himself as a clerk to Sir Roger Manwood, chief baron of the exchequer. Soon he was noticed by a Kentish neighbour, Sir Edward Waterhouse, who was chancellor of the Irish exchequer. <h2>
<a name="Earlycareer15881603"></a>Early career, 1588&#150;1603</h2>In 1588 Boyle travelled with Waterhouse to Ireland. He later contended that he had arrived with a gold bracelet, a diamond ring, and &pound;27 3<i>s</i>. in his purse: not negligible assets. In Ireland, following the earl of Desmond's uprising in the southern province of Munster, opportunities abounded. English authority had to be restored, partly through confiscating the estates of the defeated. An unscrupulous opportunist, Boyle abandoned the ailing Manwood and turned to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9296/', "Sir Geoffrey Fenton")</script> as his principal patron. Fenton, as secretary to the council and escheator, presided over the confiscations and parallel search for &#145;concealed&#146; lands which the crown claimed as its own. He was also a confidant of Lord Burghley. Through Fenton, Boyle secured the powerful post of deputy escheator. In this capacity he oversaw much of the detail of identifying, valuing, and leasing the confiscated lands. The work gave Boyle great chances for both legitimate and illicit gains and, applying himself energetically to the tasks, he quickly mastered the intricate procedures and profited. He granted large tracts at low rents to cronies and clients and kept some&#151;especially in the western province of Connaught&#151;for himself.<br>
<br>Boyle's personal holdings were further enlarged when on 6 November 1595 he married Joan, daughter of William Apsley and coheir to lands around Limerick. Joan died giving birth to a stillborn child on 14 December 1599. They had no other children. Boyle's blatant exploitation of the system in which he was officially involved and the meagre profits for the crown aroused growing criticism. These attacks also reflected the factionalism within the English administration in Dublin, where Boyle's principal patron, Fenton, was at loggerheads with Sir William Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy. Boyle, through whom Fitzwilliam planned to ruin Fenton, was threatened with arrest. He survived this threat, only to face another from the newly arrived treasurer-at-war, Sir Henry Wallop, in January 1596. Evidence of Boyle's malpractices accumulated, and he was arrested later in the year. When a new English lord deputy, Thomas, Lord Burgh, arrived in 1597, it was rumoured that Boyle might be executed for felony. Instead Burgh died, and the threat was temporarily lifted. However, Boyle's evident chicanery meant that he remained a target for &#145;reformers&#146; in the Irish administration. In 1598 he withdrew discreetly to Munster, only for rebellion to break out there, forcing him to return to London and to work at the Middle Temple. Still he was haunted by his activities in Ireland, as the warring groups carried their complaints to England. Again, luck favoured Boyle. Adversaries died. Also, the appointment of Sir George Carew as lord president of Munster enabled Boyle to attach himself to a new patron. He promptly purchased the clerkship of the presidential council of Munster, and with it a chance to re-establish himself in the province.<br>
<br>Carew smoothed Boyle's return to favour with the London government. He also prepared the ground for perhaps Boyle's greatest coup. Sir Walter Ralegh, who had been granted enormous acreages of the forfeitures in Munster during the earlier plantation, had decided to unload them. Boyle bought the Ralegh holdings, for a bargain price of &pound;1500. Much of the money for this purchase was supplied by the &pound;1000 portion of his second wife, Catherine (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1630), a daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton. They married on 25 July 1603 and had seven sons&#151;including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle (1612&#150;1698)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3138/', "Roger Boyle (1621&#150;1679)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3137/', "Robert Boyle (1627&#150;1691)")</script>&#151;and eight daughters, including the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66365/', "Katherine Jones (1615&#150;1691)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23487/', "Mary Rich (1624&#150;1678)")</script>. Again, Carew was the vital intermediary to the match. Boyle was knighted on the day of his marriage. With over 42,000 acres, Boyle was pre-eminent among the newcomers in Munster and potentially one of the richest men in Ireland. His perspective changed. The defence, consolidation, and exploitation of his estates henceforth preoccupied him. Residence and direct oversight were identified as crucial to success. Boyle rapidly developed an unrivalled familiarity with the physical and human geography of his properties, concentrated around the fertile lower reaches of the River Blackwater on the borders of counties Cork and Waterford, but with outlying portions further to the west. He also assembled a trusted and talented team of subordinates. Relations, including an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3128/', "John Boyle")</script>, were encouraged to set up in the area. At the same time he needed to protect his wealth against the envious. Technically he was already contravening the government ban on any single undertaker holding more than 10,000 acres in the plantation. These insecurities obliged him to participate in politics, in both Ireland and England. Another strategy was to hold office in Ireland, in order to increase his influence over policy. <h2>
<a name="Irishmagnate16041629"></a>Irish magnate, 1604&#150;1629</h2>The vagaries of the early Stuarts constantly threatened to disturb those lately established on Irish estates. Monarch and ministers, short of money, suspected what adventurers in Ireland such as Boyle had surreptitiously accumulated. Successive administrations considered devices by which the incumbents might be forced to disgorge some of what they held. In the event the danger of antagonizing the likes of Boyle made the government cautious. Instead, in 1606, through a commission for defective titles, the new proprietors were encouraged to buy secure titles for what they held by paying the government sums by way of composition. Boyle was particularly insecure after Ralegh was arrested and his possessions seized by the crown. Boyle protected himself by activity at court during 1604&#150;5 and, as a result, he received a fresh grant of Ralegh's Irish lands from the king. But his rights to some of his other acquisitions remained open to challenge. Accordingly Boyle exerted himself with the officials in Dublin to protect what he had earlier gained through the system of escheats. He beat off a challenge in the 1613 parliament, in which he sat as member for Lismore. Boyle had acquired this ancient settlement, and secured its recent incorporation as a borough. By 1614 he had procured a patent which promised to put his possession of lands beyond challenge. At the same time his wealth and importance were acknowledged by his appointment to the Irish privy council on 15 February 1613. Moving with increasing confidence within the Dublin administration, he formed alliances with the officials, some of whom&#151;like Boyle&#151;were on the way to regional eminence and whose methods of personal enrichment differed little from his.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Boyle took his estate in hand. Through tenancies, ecclesiastical patronage, and appointments in his boroughs he fashioned a settlement responsive to his own interests and highly profitable to himself. It was also designed as a model of what the resident and vigilant proprietor could achieve in Ireland. Simultaneously a peaceful and protestant island would be achieved and the English protestant interest advanced. Subsequently, and in part thanks to his own talents for self-advertisement, Boyle was held up as an exemplary landlord. There was no gainsaying his success in enriching himself. By 1640 his Irish rents probably yielded an annual &pound;18,000. Only the Butlers, a much older-established family, rivalled this wealth in Ireland. Even in English terms his income put Boyle on a par with the richest noblemen. And it was with such noblemen that he wanted to rank.<br>
<br>In the venal world of early Stuart Ireland it was easy enough to gain a title. Created Lord Boyle, baron of Youghal, on 6 May 1616, Boyle was advanced to the earldom of Cork on 6 October 1620. A subsidiary title, Viscount Dungarvan, was used by his heir. For these distinctions he apparently paid &pound;4500. In 1628 his younger sons Lewis and Roger were created Viscount Boyle of Kinalmeaky and Lord Broghill respectively on account of their father's services. In all, eleven of his children survived into adulthood. These children were used to advance their father both politically and socially. Their marriages were intended to strengthen ties with the dominant personality at the English court, Sir George Villiers, the future duke of Buckingham, and with the Clifford and Howard dynasties. In Ireland the same strategy linked the Boyles to the ancient and locally important Barrys, earls of Barrymore, and Fitzgeralds, earls of Kildare.<br>
<br>Despite this thickening web of connections, Cork felt insecure. He was still affected by the inherent instability caused by factional manoeuvrings in Dublin and London. He also attracted the jealousy of other settlers, the resentment of those whom he had displaced, and the suspicions of the administration that it had been tricked by him. In Ireland he faced the hostility of the lord deputy from 1615, Sir Oliver St John, whose own patronage and profiteering had been considerably depleted by Cork's activities. On his side, Cork needed to treat St John warily, since behind him stood the much more potent figure of George Villiers, the king's favourite. Villiers, thanks to St John, realized that Ireland could add substantially to his own wealth and influence. Others, hopeful of prospering from Ireland, cultivated Villiers and St John, and might come to threaten Cork's enormous acquisitions. Settlers in Munster, headed by Cork, were further perturbed by the interest of Villiers and St John in annexing the profitable export trade from Ireland to their system of patents and monopolies. This threatened to divert potential profits away from the newcomers in Ireland and in 1621 they counter-attacked. Sir John Jephson, a landowner in Munster, levelled charges against St John in the English House of Commons. St John was duly recalled, but the mood in England, encouraged alike by Buckingham and the lord treasurer, Cranfield, was to view Ireland as an asset to the king (and themselves), the potential of which had yet to be fully realized.<br>
<br>New inquiries into what had happened during the recent plantations and what might next be achieved shone a searchlight into the shadowy practices of Cork, but he was saved from immediate action by the crown to recover some of what it had lost when Cranfield was toppled in 1624. At the same time Cork hoped to ingratiate himself with Buckingham. Notwithstanding Cork's courtesies and caresses, however, Buckingham remained an uncertain ally, the more so as he was willing to entertain the complaints of Cork's adversaries from Ireland, notably the lord chancellor, Adam Loftus.<br>
<br>Buckingham's death in 1628 reduced the pressure to investigate Cork's Irish ventures but Cork, well aware that to be secure in Ireland he needed friends in England, set about cultivating new patrons, the then powerful lords Coventry and Goring and Humphrey May. As a result he received a fresh grant of much of his disputed property in 1629. This favour was eased by a loan from Cork of &pound;15,000 to the crown. An even clearer sign of his high standing was his appointment on 8 August 1629, in tandem with his rival, Adam, Viscount Loftus, as lord justice of Ireland, a post he retained until a new lord deputy sailed to Dublin in 1633.<h2>
<a name="Lordjusticeandlordtreasurer16291639"></a>Lord justice and lord treasurer, 1629&#150;1639</h2>As a lord justice Cork headed the English government of Ireland and had arrived at the plenitude of his power. His authority and status matched his wealth. Critics contended that he misused his office for personal gain. A wish to avenge himself on his old opponents made his rule divisive and&#151;in some quarters&#151;hated. Some whom he offended subsequently harassed him throughout the 1630s. The most serious quarrel developed over the finances and Cork was soon ranged against the vice-treasurer, Francis Annesley, Lord Mountnorris. The latter was briefly superseded, leaving Cork in effective control of the exchequer. This temporary situation was made more permanent when, in October 1631, Cork secured the lord treasurership, paying a mere &pound;300 for it. More positive, although hardly disinterested, were Cork's schemes while lord justice to strengthen the protestant settlers, of whom he was now clearly the most successful. He believed the government should lighten taxes and subsidize ventures to create industries of the type&#151;textiles, iron making, timber trades, and glass manufacture&#151;which he had encouraged in south Munster. Further measures, such as a tougher enforcement of the penalties for religious recusancy, were advocated to weaken the already enfeebled Catholics. Ireland, Cork contended, would thrive only if peace prevailed. Otherwise the export trade would be interrupted. The exploitation of natural resources, practised vigorously on Cork's estates, threatened to exhaust many of them simply for short-term gain. Cork, however, was prepared to justify the felling of woodlands and reclamation of bogs and waste as &#145;commonwealth work&#146;  (Ranger, &#145;Career&#146;, 131), since it destroyed the habitats of the indigenous Irish Catholics. More constructively, he sponsored urban development. Some towns in his bailiwick&#151;Youghal, Dungarvan, and Lismore&#151;were long established. Others, notably Tallow and Bandon, owed much to Cork's investment.<br>
<br>In 1633 the installation of a new lord deputy, Thomas, Lord Wentworth, once again caused Cork anxiety as to how he and his possessions would be treated. At first Wentworth proceeded circumspectly, and was thought broadly to agree with the anti-Catholic measures favoured by Cork. The earl also hoped that a projected marriage of his heir with a niece of Wentworth would ease the situation. However, Mountnorris, since his recall from Ireland, had endeared himself to Wentworth and so prejudiced the latter against Cork. Seeing favour drifting away from Cork, old opponents, fair-weather friends, and erstwhile associates deserted him. Wentworth, bent on restoring and enhancing royal authority over Ireland, saw Cork as the personification of all that had undermined it in recent decades and decided to make an example of him by stripping him of many of the church lands and other of his properties, on the grounds that they had been acquired illegally or were enjoyed on forged evidence. Simultaneously a more trivial dispute arose over the desire of Cork to raise a monument in the Dublin cathedral of St Patrick to his second wife. The monument was placed at the east end of the cathedral where the altar had formerly stood, a theologically sensitive position which attracted objections from Wentworth and the Laudian Bishop Bramhall of Derry. In addition, the monument came to symbolize the way in which Cork had commandeered so many assets of the church, sometimes by installing kinsmen and clients as bishops and deans, and through that and other devices securing beneficial leases on church lands. Wentworth, in alliance with Archbishop Laud and Bishop Bramhall, backed a campaign to recover the wealth of the church in Ireland detained by powerful lay people and Cork offered a conspicuous target.<br>
<br>Wentworth was at first uncompromising in his determination to humble Cork but intermediaries in England and Ireland eventually worked out a settlement whereby Cork was fined &pound;15,000 and surrendered his impropriations, but retained his lease on Youghal. No sooner was this protracted negotiation concluded than other parts of Cork's empire came under attack. The lord president in Munster, Sir William St Leger, unleashed by Wentworth, hounded Cork in his locality. The earl mobilized his contacts in the English privy council and court, and from 1636 spent more time in England, where in Dorset and Somerset he had bought land. His eldest son, thanks to marriage to the Clifford heiress, was inserting himself into the English aristocracy. Younger sons, after protracted education on the continent, followed the same path. All could work to their father's advantage, and shield him against what increasingly looked like a vendetta on Wentworth's part. Indeed, the lord deputy's aggression in Ireland created a coalition against him but Cork, for all his dislike of Wentworth, did not actively abet this group. He preferred to consolidate his position by building up alliances in London with Goring and Sir Thomas Stafford, the illegitimate son of his old boss Carew. On the fringes of the circle of the queen, Cork still refrained from any open criticism of Wentworth. In 1639 he demonstrated his loyalty by sending three of his sons to wait on the king as he prepared to fight the Scottish covenanters. Cork's good standing was indicated publicly in June 1640, when he was added to the English privy council.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears16401643"></a>Final years, 1640&#150;1643</h2>In Ireland the summoning of parliament in 1640 allowed a concerted attack on Wentworth, by this time earl of Strafford, chiefly through his subordinates who remained in Ireland and in office. By 1640 Cork controlled six parliamentary boroughs in south Munster, and had influence in another four. Although he used this patronage to advance his own interest, he did not direct these members to attack Strafford. In England, too, he abstained from the scheming to bring down the lord deputy. However, once the impeachment began, he backed it. Sweeter still was the removal of many of Strafford's supporters from the Irish administration. At last Cork was freed from the meddlesome inquiries into what he had or had not done to amass his possessions. But full enjoyment of these riches was frustrated when the Irish Catholics rose. The uprising, originating in Ulster in October 1641, gradually spread into Munster. The property and persons of recent settlers, like the Boyles, were particular targets. From his seat at Lismore, the former bishop's palace, Cork organized resistance. Several of his sons were sent to fight the insurgents; one, Lewis, Lord Kinalmeaky, was killed in action at Liscarrol in September 1642. Arms and equipment were shipped in through his port of Youghal. The expense, coupled with the loss of rents, burdened Cork but, in acting to save his and co-religionists' holdings, he also looked to a future in which protestant power would be increased. He joined the campaign of Irish protestants to use the rebellion to justify further expropriation of Catholic-owned property. By 1643 the fiercely anti-Catholic in Ireland, such as Cork, found themselves at odds with Charles I and his deputy Ormond. Unable to defeat the insurgents in either Ireland or England, the king authorized a truce with the Irish adversaries in September 1643. This cessation strained Cork's attachment to the royalist cause. Since acquiring his great stake in Ireland, his attitude towards official policy had altered. Distant regimes were judged ultimately on the freedom that they allowed to buccaneers like himself. Concessions to the local Catholics were strenuously but&#151;in 1643&#151;unsuccessfully opposed. Cork, having retreated to his enclave of Youghal, died on 15 September 1643, and was buried in St Mary's Abbey, Youghal. It fell to his sons to sustain and finance the war effort in the region. Through flexible strategies reminiscent of Cork's, they saved and subsequently enlarged the extensive settlement which would be regarded by Oliver Cromwell as the model for a placid and prosperous protestant Ireland. Others, less sympathetic to these freebooters, felt that they personified both a system which sacrificed Irish to English interests, and the licence granted to rapacious adventurers from England, Wales, and Scotland.<br>
<br>Cork composed an autobiography through which he hoped to impress contemporaries and later generations with what he had accomplished. He allowed that divine favour had assisted his rise. Indeed, he adopted &#145;God's providence is mine inheritance&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>) as his motto. Inevitably his account exaggerated the gradient of his rise, and glossed over much of his ruthlessness. The plantation over which he presided was built on the wreckage of earlier civilizations, not all of which were totally effaced. Cork was prepared to marry children into families which belonged to those earlier settlements. Similarly he used the compliant among them as his auxiliaries. He was happy to take over ancient buildings in Lismore and Youghal as his principal residences. Although they were enlarged and furnished sumptuously, their essential characters were not altered. Rivals, whether among the older Catholic or newer English communities, were relentlessly harried. Cork had a vision of a protestant Ireland which he set out to realize on his own estates. Much of it was lifted from an idealized lowland England, and did not always fit the conditions of southern Ireland. Silently he dropped some of his ambitions and adjusted to indigenous ways. Just as there was no denying that Cork had scrambled to the top of Irish protestant society, he also attracted new settlers to the region, so altering it permanently. Impressive as the achievements looked, his protestant towns were too fragile to withstand the Catholic onslaught after 1641. The protestant population in the Munster countryside, increased perhaps to 22,000, remained puny. Much that he had built so painstakingly was destroyed and had to be refashioned after 1649. Nevertheless, Cork had laid durable foundations for a dynasty which for more than a century would dominate the economy, society, and politics of Munster, Ireland, and even England. His reputation as the nonpareil of the industrious English settler, carefully fabricated by his own writings, survived long after he had died. Similarly, vestiges of what he had achieved were visible under his successors, from the 1750s the dukes of Devonshire, into the twenty-first century.<br>
