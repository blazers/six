<span class="headword">Ayton,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1786, <em>d.</em> 1823), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, was baptized at St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, on 8 February 1786, the son of William Ayton (<i>d</i>. 1799) and his wife, Mary. His father, a son of William Ayton, banker in Lombard Street, moved some time afterwards to Macclesfield, Cheshire, and at the grammar school of that town young Ayton obtained a good elementary knowledge of Latin and Greek. In accordance with the wish of his father, that Ayton should be educated for the bar, he was sent to study law at Manchester and at the end of a year he became the pupil of a barrister in London; but, disliking the profession from the start, he never set himself seriously to prepare for it.<br>
<br>As soon as Ayton came of age, he retired to the coast of Sussex, resolved to limit his expenses to his comparatively small income, and there he amused himself with desultory reading and active outdoor exercise, boating being his special delight. In 1811 he returned to London and accepted a situation in a public office, but he relinquished it in 1813 to accompany William Daniell ARA in a voyage around Great Britain. An account of the voyage, with views drawn and engraved by Daniell, appeared in eight volumes between 1814 and 1825, but the letterpress of only the first two volumes is by Ayton. Disagreeing with Daniell about his plans for the future volumes, Ayton declined to proceed further with the account and began to write plays. Two of his farces, acted at Covent Garden, were total failures, but he adapted from the French several pieces for the English Opera House with some success.<br>
<br>During a voyage between Scarborough and London, Ayton was nearly shipwrecked and he received an injury to his ankle that confined him to bed for more than a year. In the spring of 1821 he was sufficiently recovered to go to the coast of Sussex, but his health continued to be uncertain and precarious. In July 1823 his illness assumed so serious a form that he went for medical advice to London, where he died shortly afterwards. During the last eighteen months of his life Ayton occupied himself in the composition of a number of essays, chiefly on pastimes and similar subjects, written in a genial and playful spirit and displaying considerable sprightliness and humour. These, with a short memoir prefixed, were published in 1825.<br>
