<span class="headword">Murray,  Charles Fairfax</span>  (1849&#150;1919), <span class="occ">artist and art connoisseur</span>, was born on 13 September 1849 at 14 High Street, Bow, in London, the son of James Dalton Murray (1808&#150;1876), a draper, and Elizabeth Scott (1816&#150;1853). About 1862 he was working in an engineering drawing office, but he entered Edward Burne-Jones's studio about 1866&#150;7, as an assistant. Murray exhibited a painting, <span class="italic">Children in the Woods</span> (exh. RA, 1867), and began work for William Morris. His tasks included transferring designs to stained glass (including the windows of the Castle Howard chapel), doing miniature illustrations for Morris's poems (including <span class="italic">A Book of Verses</span>, 1870, <span class="italic">Virgil</span>, 1875, and the <span class="italic">Ruba'yat</span>, 1872, painting panels on furniture, and transferring Burne-Jones's designs to the South Kensington Museum panels. In 1869&#150;70 he worked in Rossetti's workshop as assistant, factotum, and proof-reader of Rossetti's poems, and in October 1870 he travelled with Morris to Bruges. Touring Italy in 1871&#150;2 he executed copies of the Camposanto frescoes in Pisa: Burne-Jones showed John Ruskin these copies and Ruskin hired Murray as a copyist, sending him to Italy where he copied for Ruskin until 1883. Murray began living in Florence after 1878, periodically returning to London from about 1884&#150;5. He took a studio in Holland Park on 19 November 1886, and leased Burne-Jones's home, The Grange, from 1898. His paintings are in a late Pre-Raphaelite style, while his copies encompass both Renaissance and Pre-Raphaelite art, including copies of several of Rossetti's paintings.<br>
<br>Murray's major contributions were as collector, art dealer, connoisseur, and buyer, for public museums as well as for private collectors. His own collections included Italian and English art, especially Pre-Raphaelite art, rare and illuminated books, incunabula of different origins, and a complete series of the Kelmscott editions, forming one of the finest European book collections. Ruskin praised Murray's knowledge of Italian art in <span class="italic">Ariadne Florentina</span> in 1872, and in 1877 Murray acquired Verrocchio's <span class="italic">Madonna and Child</span> for him for &pound;100. During the late 1870s he was a consultant for Charles Moore of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. During the 1890s he was a consultant for several directors of the Fitzwilliam Museum&#151;J. H. Middleton, M. R. James, and Sydney Cockerell&#151;and was a generous benefactor of that museum, donating Titian's <span class="italic">Tarquin and Lucretia</span> in 1918. He worked for two directors of the National Gallery, Frederick Burton and Edward Poynter, obtaining works by several early Italian painters, including Duccio, Matteo di Giovanni, Nicol&ograve; di Buonaccorso, Andrea del Castagno, Giovanni Bellini, and Barna da Siena, and donating a Pietro Lorenzetti painting in 1882. He worked for the South Kensington Museum under Thomas Armstrong for whom he purchased Orcagna's mosaic from the west front of Orvieto Cathedral about 1890&#151;and for his successor, J. H. Middleton. He also advised Edward Hooper of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1897. His publications include several volumes on the rare books in his collections, a catalogue of the duke of Portland's collection (1894), and catalogues of his drawing collections. He was an agent for the art dealership Agnew's and for the dealer Martin Colnaghi. In 1903&#150;6 he sold his Pre-Raphaelite collection to the Birmingham City Museum; between 1907 and 1910 he sold his Renaissance drawings to Pierpont Morgan for &pound;40,000 (Pierpont Morgan Library, New York). He gave paintings to the Dulwich Gallery in 1911, and three years later sold some of his collection at Georges Petit, Paris, for 1,668,800 French francs. After his death, his library was sold in England; his son John's collection was sold in 1929; the remaining collection was sold in 1961.<br>
<br>Murray was a typical Victorian connoisseur, who valued sensibility above science. He looked for &#145;quality&#146;, holding that the identity of the artist should not affect appreciation of a work of art on its own merits; although happy to give attributions, he wisely recognized that these were merely opinions open to revision as art historical studies advanced. Murray advised the budding connoisseur to train the eye by the study of one school at a time, holding that connoisseurship was &#145;just a question of memory and practice&#146;. This workmanlike attitude to his profession was underpinned by a shrewd eye to the financial value of art: when asked if his reattributions had devalued one client's collection, Murray replied that &#145;it is worth &hellip; about two-and-a-half times as much as it was before&#146;  (Benson, 216&#150;18).<br>
<br>On 10 April 1875 Murray married Angelica Albina Isolina Collevicchi (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1927), a seventeen-year-old, originally from Volterra; they lived in Siena and after 1878 in Florence. They had six surviving children, three daughters and three sons, all born in Florence and holding dual nationalities. One other daughter died very young. In February 1888 Murray met Blanche Richmond (<i>d</i>. 1952), with whom he had a family in London of six children. Murray died at his home, 77 Barrowgate Road, Chiswick, Middlesex, on 25 January 1919. His drawings are held by his family and in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Birmingham Art Gallery, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and the Delaware Art Museum, and in the universities of Yale, Princeton, and Stanford.<br>
