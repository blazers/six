<span class="headword">Hooten <span class="st"> [Hooton; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Carrier]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, first appears as Elizabeth Carrier on 11 May 1628 at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, when she married Oliver Hooten (<i>d</i>. 1657), a prosperous farmer. Their son Samuel was baptized at Ollerton on 4 May 1633, but they subsequently moved to Skegby near Mansfield. There were at least five other children: Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1636), John (<i>bap</i>. 1639), Josiah (<i>bap</i>. 1641), Oliver, and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>After leaving the Church of England at an unknown date, Hooten appears to have been active in her local Baptist community and perhaps as a preacher, but according to her son Oliver, writing years later in 1686 or 1687, &#145;after some time finding them that they were not upright hearted to the Lord but did his work negligently&#146;  (Mack, 146), she parted company with them. She may have been the first person to be &#145;convinced&#146; by George Fox about 1647. Initially, Oliver Hooten seems to have opposed his wife's new beliefs &#145;in so much that they had like to have parted&#146;  (ibid., 197), but some time in the next decade he turned Quaker himself, for his death is recorded in the Quaker digest registers for the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire quarterly meeting. Fox wrote in his journal that about 1649 Elizabeth's &#145;mouth was opned to preach y<sup>e</sup> gospell&#146;  (Fox, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.325). Gerard Croese noted in 1696 that she &#145;was the first of her sex among the Quakers who attempted to imitate men, and preach&#146; and suggested that she was a role model for women: &#145;after her example, many of her sex had the confidence to undertake the same office&#146;  (Croese, 37). Hooten was obviously very close to Fox in the late 1640s and an important figure in the incipient movement. About 1649 or 1650 he appointed a meeting at her home in Skegby, where he miraculously healed a woman.<br>
<br>Hooten soon troubled the authorities with her preaching and her protestations against the corruption of the clergy and magistrates. Her first recorded imprisonment appears to have been in Derby about 1651 for reproving a minister. In 1652 she was imprisoned in York Castle for admonishing a minister and his congregation in Rotherham at the close of their worship. With other Quakers, including Mary Fisher and Thomas Aldam, she was a signatory to <span class="italic">False Prophets and False Teachers</span> (1652), a tract attacking paid ministry, written in the castle. Her experiences at York led her to write to Oliver Cromwell criticizing the legal system. She noted that many murderers &#145;escaped throughe frends &amp; money, &amp; pore people for Lesser facts are put to death&#146;, while lamenting that in prison many &#145;Lighe worse than doggs for want of strawe&#146;  (Manners, 10). In 1653 Fox was imprisoned in Carlisle for preaching with other leading Quakers including Hooten, James Nayler, and William Dewsbury. After delivering the Quaker message at a church in Beckingham, Lincolnshire, in 1654, Hooten was imprisoned for five months, becoming the first to suffer for Friends in that county. She served a further three weeks in Lincoln in 1655 for &#145;exhorting the people to repentance&#146;  (Besse, 1.346). Harsh treatment by a female gaoler prompted her to write once again &#145;to him in Authority&#146; (presumably meaning Cromwell), condemning prison conditions  (Manners, 15). In 1660 Hooten was back in Nottinghamshire where a man named Jackson, the minister for Selston, violently assaulted her, allegedly without provocation, while she was walking along the road.<br>
<br>Hooten's husband died on 30 June 1657. Four years later, in 1661, she travelled to America with Joane Brooksup or Brooksop. Her son Samuel opposed the undertaking, but later supported her decision and eventually preached in America himself. Arriving at Boston, via Virginia, they were imprisoned by Governor Endicott and then driven for two days out into the wilderness and left to starve. They managed to make their way to Rhode Island, from where they obtained a passage to Barbados, before returning once again to Boston &#145;to testify against the spirit of persecution there predominant&#146;  (Besse, 2.229). Apprehended by a constable, they were then put on board a ship for Virginia and eventually returned to England.<br>
<br>Once there, Hooten repeatedly petitioned Charles II in the hope that she would be able to live more comfortably on a proposed return trip to America. In 1662 she handed letters to the king in St James's Park, causing a stir among bystanders because she did not kneel. Receiving no reply, she continued to harangue Charles and was, she recalled, &#145;moved to goe amongst them againe at Whitehall in sacke-cloathe and ashes&#146;  (Manners, 37). Hooten eventually obtained a royal licence to settle in any of the American colonies, and sailed to Massachusetts with her daughter, Elizabeth. She asked the Boston authorities on numerous occasions for a house, a place for Friends to meet, and land for a burial-ground, but was refused in spite of the king's recommendations. Hooten afterwards travelled eastwards and was imprisoned first at Hampton and then at Dover for her activities against ministers. Next, at Cambridge, she called people to repentance as she walked through the streets and was imprisoned yet again for two days and nights in &#145;a noisome, stinking dungeon&#146;, without food or water  (Bishop, 99). A magistrates' order that she be whipped through the three towns of Cambridge, Water Town, and Dedham &#145;was rigorously executed&#146;  (Besse, 2.229). Once again she was sent out into the wilderness on horseback yet managed to make her way back to Rhode Island, later returning to a place near Cambridge with her daughter and an old woman named Sarah Coleman. After further whippings, Hooten returned to Boston, where she was sent to the house of correction, then again whipped through three towns (Roxbury, Dedham, and Medfield) and cast out into the wilderness. After further imprisonment in Boston and Rhode Island she was warned that she faced execution or branding should she ever return. In &#145;Some more of the sufferings of Elizabeth Hooten&#146; in George Bishop's <span class="italic">New England Judged</span> (1667) she described how she was able to withstand this constant string of punishments, writing through God-given strength.<br>
<br>Hooten then returned to England and resumed her work as an itinerant preacher. The Quaker historian William Sewel noted at the time that he had &#145;several times seen her in England in a good condition&#146;  (Sewel, 570). In 1663 she suffered the distraint of three mares and other losses which made it very difficult for her to continue farming. In 1667 she wrote a letter to Friends condemning John Perrot, the Quaker schismatic, and his followers and linked them with Ranterism. In 1670 she published an address of her own in Thomas Taylor's <span class="italic">To the King and both Houses of Parliament</span>, in which she criticized the authorities for the severity of persecution against Quakers ensuing from the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. Hooten was a fairly prolific letter writer, who often petitioned the authorities, as she did the king for the release of Margaret Fox from Lancaster Castle. Her letters, which include many to other Friends, are of considerable importance for the insights they provide into the &#145;radicalism&#146; of early Quakerism. Perhaps surprisingly, she published very little; apart from the aforementioned works, she was signatory to a testimony for William Simpson contained in <span class="italic">A Short Relation Concerning the Life and Death of William Simpson</span> (1671).<br>
<br>On 11 August 1671 Hooten crossed the Atlantic for the last time, on this occasion with George Fox and other Friends, including Solomon Eccles and William Edmunson. They passed from Barbados to Jamaica, where at Port Royal Hooten died in February 1672. Her cause of death is unclear, though a testimony from the Quaker James Lancaster recorded that her body was weak and swollen and she was unable to speak. She was buried in Jamaica.<br>
