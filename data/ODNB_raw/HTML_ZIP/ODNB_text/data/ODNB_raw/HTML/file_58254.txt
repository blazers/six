<span class="headword">Massie,  John</span>  (1842&#150;1925), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and politician</span>, was born on 3 December 1842 at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, the son of Robert Massie, a Congregational minister, and his wife, May Soutter. In 1848 the father moved to Atherstone, Warwickshire. Massie was educated at Atherstone grammar school and subsequently at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar in 1862 and became a scholar in 1864. He obtained a second class in the classical tripos in 1866. During his first few years as a graduate he lived at Highgate, Middlesex, and prepared pupils for university entrance. In 1869 he became classical tutor at the Congregational theological college at Spring Hill, Birmingham. Two years later he was appointed professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> exegesis at that college, and was known as an accurate and congenial teacher. He held this post at Birmingham, together with his classical tutorship, until 1886, when the college moved to Oxford. On 19 July 1876 he married Edith Mary (1848&#150;1933), daughter of Alexander Ogilvie, civil engineer, of Sizewell House, Suffolk, and the couple settled at Leamington Spa. Massie became involved in local politics, and in 1878 he was elected to the town council at Leamington Spa, later becoming an alderman. He remained a member of the council until 1887.<br>
<br>In 1886 Spring Hill College was closed, its endowments being transferred to Mansfield College, the new Congregational theological institution at Oxford which replaced it. Mansfield began its work at 90 High Street, Oxford, in October 1886. Three years later its new premises, built in spacious gothic style, were opened.<br>
<br>Massie moved to Oxford, took up residence at Headington, and from 1886 to 1903 continued his scholarly occupation as Yates professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> exegesis at Mansfield. He became associated with the university as an incorporated MA at Corpus Christi College. At Mansfield he was initially the only member of staff apart from the principal, the Revd Andrew Martin Fairbairn. In the college Massie commanded respect for his teaching ability, his friendliness towards the students, and his performances on the cricket field. His scholarly writing was equally sound, though small in quantity&#151;appearing as commentaries on the first and second epistles to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> (published in the <span class="roman">Century Bible</span>, 1901) and as articles in biblical dictionaries and religious magazines. In 1901, when he attended the tercentenary celebrations at Yale University as Mansfield College representative, he was awarded an honorary DD of that university.<br>
<br>Massie was devoted to educational work outside Mansfield as well as within it, and to political work for the Liberal Party. From 1890 he was vice-chairman of the council of Leamington High School for Girls. In 1894 he became an assistant commissioner to the royal commission on secondary education, in which capacity he wrote an official report on secondary schools in Warwickshire. On the political side, he was on the executive of the National Liberal Federation from 1894 to 1906, and again from 1910, and was treasurer of the federation from 1903 to 1906. He published political pamphlets in the 1890s against dogmatic teaching in schools and on university education for Catholics in Ireland. His political nonconformity was indicated by his spells as president of the Liberation Society (or Society for the Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control), and as president of the Oxford and District Free Church Council for twenty-five years (1896&#150;1921). He also had a period as president of the Body of Protestant Dissenting Deputies. He served the Congregational Union of England and Wales as chairman of its council and of its committees for education and general purposes, as well as being a benefactor of, and loyal attender at, its churches. Massie's many roles were liable to draw him into conflict with others, but he was genial by nature and upheld his opinions without bitterness, so managing to maintain friendships with persons whose views were far removed from his own.<br>
<br>Massie took part in the nonconformist opposition to the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1902, and after the bill had gone through he passively resisted paying the local education rate. In 1903 he relinquished his professorship in order to give more time to public and political work. He was given a fairly promising parliamentary seat to fight (the Cricklade division of Wiltshire), and entered parliament in the Liberal landslide of January 1906, holding the seat for the Liberals by a substantial majority of 1578 (7294 votes to 5716) over a Liberal Unionist. He lost the seat to a Unionist by 635 votes in January 1910. In the Commons he spoke frequently, if usually briefly, in support of the Liberal government's unsuccessful education bills, and on ritualism, disestablishment, and the <span class="roman">Irish University Bill</span> of 1908. He also spoke against women's suffrage&#151;a subject on which he joined Asquith and others in a minority of the Liberal MPs&#151;and he became treasurer of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League. &#145;Massie is tiresome and loses himself in petty detail&#146;, Cromer told Curzon in September 1910, &#145;but one must bear with him&#146;; by listening &#145;to all the paltry tittle-tattle&#146; Massie causes &#145;a great deal more friction than he allays&#146;  (Cromer to Curzon, 14 and 29 Sept 1910, Curzon MSS, BL OIOC, MS Eur. F/112/33).<br>
<br>Massie did not sit again in parliament after January 1910, but he remained active in public life for many years. As well as the denominational and wider free church activities already mentioned, and work for the National Liberal Federation, he was a diligent JP for Oxfordshire. From 1916 to 1921 he chaired the Oxfordshire committee established under the <span class="roman">War Pensions Act</span>. He died at 84 Harley Street, London, on 11 November 1925, as the result of double pneumonia accelerated by the shock of being knocked down by a taxi-cab. He was survived by his wife.<br>
