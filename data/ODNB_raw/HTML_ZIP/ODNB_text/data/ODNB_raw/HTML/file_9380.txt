<span class="headword">Fiddes,  Richard</span>  (1671&#150;1725), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, the eldest son of John Fiddes, was born at Hunmanby in the East Riding of Yorkshire. After attending a school at Wykeham, near Scarborough, he matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 21 October 1687. In March 1690 he migrated to University College, where he was remembered as &#145;a very hard drinker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.396), and took the degree of BA in 1691. Following his return to Yorkshire he married Jane Anderson, &#145;a gentlewoman well descended and of a good fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), in 1693. Having taken holy orders he was presented in 1696 to the rectory of Halsham in Holderness by Ralph Rand of Skirlaugh. Though the parish was small and afforded Fiddes leisure for study, his health and voice were impaired by the damp location. Having been granted leave of non-residence by the archbishop of York, John Sharp, he moved first to Wykeham and then, in 1712, to London. However, he did not sever his Yorkshire associations: he preached a sermon at Beeford in Holderness on the death of Queen Anne in 1714 and dedicated his <span class="italic">Fifty Two Practical Discourses</span> (1720) to Sir Arthur Kaye, the high-tory MP for Yorkshire from 1710 to 1726.<br>
<br>Having published several sermons in an attempt to provide for the financial needs of his large family Fiddes made some reputation as a writer even before his arrival in London. Introduced to Jonathan Swift in 1713 by George Smalridge, the dean of Christ Church, Oxford, Fiddes rapidly established valuable connections with prominent members of Queen Anne's last tory administration. He became a chaplain to Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, and obtained a further chaplain's place&#151;to the garrison at Hull&#151;through the interest of the duke of Ormond. On 1 February 1714, on a motion moved by Smalridge, he was admitted to the degree of BD by diploma at Oxford. Two days earlier, on 30 January, the anniversary of the martyrdom of Charles I, he had preached a sermon, later published with a dedication to the high-tory secretary of state, William Bromley, MP for Oxford University. A devout high-churchman who revered the memory of Charles I, Fiddes vigorously approved the tory measures to secure the Church of England against the encroachments of dissent. He warmly supported the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span> (1711) and the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span> (1714) but shared in the general proscription of the tory party after the death of Queen Anne, and lost his chaplain's place at Hull.<br>
<br>Though Fiddes was not a Jacobite his allegiance to the Hanoverian succession was unenthusiastic: &#145;there must be somewhere, of necessity, a last Resort of Power&#146;  (R. Fiddes, <span class="italic">Sermon &hellip; on the &hellip; Death of Queen Anne</span>, 1714, 30). The tone of his <span class="italic">Remarks on the State Anatomy of Great Britain</span> (1717), answering a notoriously anticlerical work by the deistical writer John Toland, was uncompromising. High-churchmen, he insisted, were still &#145;the greatest part of the Nation&#146;  (p. 51) and the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span> was &#145;the great Security of the Protestant Succession and of the Peace of the Church&#146;  (p. 59). Like his friend the nonjuror William Law, Fiddes maintained that the church possessed a divine commission independent of any reliance upon civil government, and in <span class="italic">A Preparative to the Lord's Supper &hellip; with Meditations and Prayers</span> (1718) his eucharistic doctrine and sense of the importance of the apostolic order of the ministry were again revealed as those of a high-churchman, thoroughly hostile towards &#145;<i>Enthusiasts</i>, who under pretence of greater Light &hellip; decry all external Rites&#146;  (p. 37). In the same year he published <span class="italic">Theologia speculativa, or, The First Part of a Body of Divinity</span> (1718), a handsome folio dedicated to Archbishop William Dawes of York. Both archbishops and nineteen diocesan bishops, together with many prominent tories and high-churchmen, were among the more than 500 who subscribed to the work. Explaining that he had been moved to compile the volume out of a sense of frustration caused by &#145;incapacity for discharging my ministerial function&#146;  (p. xxvi) Fiddes expressed a hope that it would help &#145;young divines&#146; to counteract the influence of &#145;atheism and infidelity, for which free-thinking is of late substituted only as a softer name&#146;  (p. vi). The second part of the work, <span class="italic">Theologia practica</span>, was published in 1720. In 1724 Fiddes continued his systematic defence of orthodox Christianity in <span class="italic">A General Treatise of Morality</span> (1724). Written against Shaftesbury's <span class="italic">Inquiry Concerning Virtue</span> and Mandeville's <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span>, and displaying marked sympathy with the works of Malebranche and Norris of Bemerton, this book was a notable defence of revelation against the claims of natural religion.<br>
<br>As a writer on non-religious subjects Fiddes had an uneven reputation. His <span class="italic">Prefatory epistle concerning some remarks to be published on Homer's Iliad, occasioned by the proposals of Mr Pope towards a new English version</span>, though topical at the time of its publication in 1714, failed to enlist public support for a more detailed treatment of the subject. However, <span class="italic">The Life of Cardinal Wolsey</span> (1724), a work of notable originality, attracted much interest. Dedicated to the chancellors and members of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge its courageous aim to do &#145;justice to [Wolsey's] injured memory&#146;  (p. ii) was supported by 260 pages of original documents. Fiddes' attempt to represent the medieval Roman Catholic church in an impartial fashion attracted predictable hostility, notably in the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> and from Dr Samuel Knight, a prebendary of Ely; and his gracious determination to acknowledge the scholarly assistance of Bishop Francis Atterbury, even after the latter's conviction and banishment, attracted the further accusation of sympathy with Jacobitism. The volume's large subscription list&#151;heavily high-church, high-tory, and nonjuring in character&#151;contained the names of many Jacobite subscribers; these included the earl of Orrery and Lord North and Grey, both imprisoned in the aftermath of the Atterbury plot. However, the Jacobite antiquary Thomas Hearne thought as little of the <span class="italic">Life of Wolsey</span>&#151;&#145;a very indifferent Thing&#146;&#151;as he did of the abilities of the author: &#145;Dr Fiddes is a mercenary, careless Writer and will do anything for lucre, as I have been told&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.274). A further study, of the lives of Sir Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher, remained unfinished at Fiddes' death and has since been lost.<br>
<br>Fiddes died on 8 July 1725 at Putney, at the home of his friend John Anstis, Garter king of arms. He was buried in Fulham churchyard, leaving a wife and six children, and Hearne reported that &#145;'tis thought his heart was broke with the Troubles of his Family and some other misfortunes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.397).<br>
