<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1581), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the seventh son of Gavin Hamilton of Orbiston, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Marion Wallace. He studied at the University of St Andrews in the early 1550s, and by 1559 was working with John Knox and the protestant lords of the congregation. At the beginning of August that year he and Knox conferred with Sir James Croft in Berwick Castle in the hope of securing assistance from the English government for the congregation, but none was then forthcoming. On 20 December 1560 the general assembly declared Hamilton qualified for the ministry. With Knox, John Row, and George Hay, he met at the house of Sir James McGill, clerk register, in early November 1561, to argue for the right of subjects to suppress the idolatry of their sovereign (that is, Queen Mary's hearing of mass), but the ministers were opposed by a number of leading laymen, including the earl of Morton and Lord James Stewart. At the general assembly of December 1563 Hamilton and others came to Knox's defence, recalling that at the Reformation he had been commissioned to convene the brethren if the church was threatened. Hamilton was apparently in some kind of trouble himself by late 1565, for on 26 December Knox and three superintendents issued a testimonial on his and Robert Campbell's behalf, declaring:<blockquote>causes of treasoun ar laid to the charge of innocent men, thare substances ar spoiled, and thare lives ar sought, because thei have travaled for mantenance of vertu and suppressing of ydolatrie, of which nomber, these our brethern &hellip; haith bene tuo chief men. (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 6.430)</blockquote>By 4 September 1566 Hamilton had succeeded Christopher Goodman as minister of St Andrews. On that date Hamilton was one of fourteen ministers who wrote to Theodore Beza endorsing the second Helvetic confession, excepting only its provisions for the celebration of the holy days associated with Christ's life. He attended the general assemblies of June 1567, July 1568, July 1569, March 1572 (when he was moderator), March 1573, and April, June, and October 1576, and served on committees to hear complaints and requests, revise the superintendents' visitation schedules (July 1568), review visitation records (April 1576), and discuss policy (autumn 1576). In July 1569 he was a member of the assembly's delegation that presented articles dealing with clerical maintenance, the appointment of superintendents, and a protest against pluralism to the regent and nobles.<br>
<br>In the political upheavals of the early 1570s Hamilton came under pressure from both sides. In July 1570 he was denounced by James Carmichael, schoolmaster in St Andrews, for failing to condemn the assassins of the earl of Moray. In the civil strife of 1571 he remained neutral, though his kinsmen were among those supporters of Queen Mary who seized control of Edinburgh in April; however, he was criticized for his neutralism by students of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, who supported the king's forces. Yet when Knox attacked the Hamiltons and Sir William Kirkaldy for backing Mary's cause, Hamilton is alleged to have accused him of being himself as much a murderer as any Hamilton for having discussed with Moray plans to murder the earl of Darnley. Knox wrote to Hamilton in November denying the charge, and he also asked Archbishop John Douglas and John Rutherford to urge Hamilton to render satisfaction. Although Hamilton denied Knox's charge, a meeting of the two men accomplished nothing. Richard Bannatyne, Knox's secretary, wrote scathingly of Hamilton's altered preaching, contrasting his willingness to reprove Mary and her court while she was on the throne with his reticence to speak out after the Hamiltons embraced the queen's cause. Hamilton's election as moderator of the general assembly on 6 March 1572 seems not to have been achieved without opposition, &#145;for thingis went not as the most godly and upricht desyred&#146;  (Bannatyne, 227); James Melville regarded him as evil-minded because of his opposition to Knox and &#145;the guid cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 26). Contemporary comments on his sermons suggest that he had sought to rise above the partisan strife by addressing general spiritual concerns.<br>
<br>In August 1574 the general assembly ordered Hamilton and his elders and deacons to respond to allegations that they had tolerated Robin Hood plays during a fast ordered by the assembly as well as secular plays on the sabbath, and had failed to hold exercises for ministers and elders to study scripture. Appearing before the Edinburgh session on 24 February 1575, Hamilton declared he had known nothing of the fast, that he had asked the magistrates to ban the Robin Hood plays, and that he and his elders were too busy to convene exercises. Accused also of not preaching on Friday and Sunday afternoons, he averred that he was only following Goodman's practice.<br>
<br>On 17 January 1575 Hamilton had accepted appointment as principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews, which he also served as a regent (master), and where, owing to reforms in 1574, he did some lecturing on Hebrew. In April 1576, however, the general assembly, whose approval to accept the provostship Hamilton had not sought, objected to his holding two positions, and in October it ordered him to resign the provostship because it impeded the performance of his ministerial duties. He refused, even after a meeting with James Martin, master of St Salvator's, but was finally deprived of his provostship, probably on 13 December 1579 and certainly by 17 June 1580. He later proceeded against his successor, Andrew Melville, for arrears of salary, prompting the latter to appeal to parliamentary commissioners for relief. The case, unresolved at the time of Hamilton's death in Edinburgh on 16 April 1581, was continued by his widow and children. At an unrecorded date he had married Elizabeth (or Elspeth), daughter of John Traill the younger of Magask. They had four children, Robert, James, Thomas, and Helen, who married Robert Hamilton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1595), minister of Kennoway, Fife. After Hamilton's death, Elizabeth married Thomas Buchanan, minister of Ceres, Fife, and nephew of the historian George Buchanan. She died on 9 December 1595.<br>
