<span class="headword">Trelawney <span class="st"> [Trelawny]</span>,  Charles</span>  (1653&#150;1731), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the fourth but second surviving son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1623&#150;1681), of Trelawne, Pelynt, Cornwall, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour of Berry Pomeroy, near Totnes, Devon. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27689/', "Sir Jonathan Trelawny, third baronet (1650&#150;1721)")</script>, bishop of Winchester, Henry (<i>c</i>.1658&#150;1702), and John (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1680). Commissioned in 1672 into the duke of Monmouth's royal English regiment, an auxiliary formation in the French army, Trelawney served during the invasion of the Dutch republic and at the siege of Maastricht in 1673. On 16 March 1674 he transferred as captain into the 2nd battalion of the royal English, commanded by Bevil Skelton. He probably saw action at the battle of Enzheim in 1674, and was certainly involved at Altenheim in 1675. He returned to England in 1677 and was commissioned captain-lieutenant of the old battalion of Monmouth's Foot in 1678, and promoted major on 1 November. On 13 July 1680 he was appointed major of the earl of Plymouth's infantry regiment raised for Tangier. Promotion to lieutenant-colonel of Plymouth's followed on 27 November 1680, when Percy Kirke became colonel, and colonel on 23 April 1682. On the evacuation of Tangier in 1684 he sailed to England, and part of his regiment fought at Sedgemoor in 1685. A leading member of the army conspiracy against James II, he deserted to William of Orange from Warminster in November 1688 accompanied by his lieutenant-colonel, Charles Churchill, a number of officers, and 200 men. James immediately dismissed him, but he was reinstated by William of Orange on 31 December 1688. Promoted brigadier-general on 6 March 1689, he served in Ireland leading a brigade across the river at Slanebridge to turn the Jacobite left during the battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. During September he took part in Marlborough's operations against Cork and Kinsale and was promoted to major-general on 2 December 1690. A lifelong tory&#151;he was elected tory MP for East Looe from 1685 until 1695 and for Plymouth from 1698 to 1710&#151;he resigned his colonelcy on 1 January 1692 to his brother Henry in protest at William's favouring of Dutch and German general officers. His decision was made easier by his acquisition of the Hengar estate through marriage on 1 May 1690 to Anne Morice (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter and heiress of Richard Lower MD of Covent Garden, Westminster, and widow of William Morice of Werrington, Devon (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1688). When Thomas Tollemache died following the Brest expedition in 1694, there was a rumour that Trelawney might succeed him as colonel of the Coldstream Guards but this was opposed by the whigs, John Cutts receiving the appointment. In 1696 Trelawney was made governor of Plymouth, a post he held until 1722. He married, on 25 June 1699, Elizabeth Mitchell, daughter of Thomas Mitchell, rector of Notgrove, Gloucestershire, from 1665 until 1686. They had one daughter. He died at Hengar on 24 September 1731 and was buried at Pelynt.<br>
