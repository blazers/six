<span class="headword">Scrope,  Henry</span>, third Baron Scrope of Masham  (<em>c.</em>1376&#150;1415), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Stephen, second Baron Scrope of Masham (<i>d</i>. 1406), and Margery, widow of John, Lord Huntingfield. Little is known of his career before the accession of Henry IV. During his youth he gained some military experience overseas, receiving payment of &pound;20 from Richard II in 1390 for his expenses in serving in Barbary. In August 1397 he was in receipt of an annuity of &pound;40 from Richard II, an award immediately continued by Henry IV following the deposition of Richard II. The transition to the new regime was a smooth one for Scrope, who may have sympathized with the opponents of Richard II, since in his will of 1415 he asked that masses be said for the soul of Thomas, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1397), and bequeathed to the bishop of Winchester a small breviary given to Scrope by the duke.<br>
<br>Scrope's commitment to the new regime was obvious by 1403, when he was styled &#145;king's knight&#146; and went on active military service in Wales. Given custody of Laugharne Castle in Carmarthenshire, he helped to defeat the rebels at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, and received a share of their forfeited possessions. He was still serving in Wales in 1406, when he came into his inheritance on the death of his father, while from 1408 he was employed on diplomatic service to the crown. In that year Scrope accompanied the king's daughter Philippa to Denmark for her marriage, and in 1409 he travelled to Paris for negotiations with French ambassadors. He was made knight of the Garter in 1410.<br>
<br>In January 1410 Scrope was appointed treasurer of England, an office he held until December 1411. Since this office was normally held by individuals with substantial personal means, the appointment is an indicator of Scrope's political reliability and of his wealth, a wealth that enabled him to make large loans to the crown. Scrope's political standing is shown by his being granted the towns of Hampstead and Hendon in July 1411 for the lodging of his men, servants, and horses during his attendance at parliament and at the king's council, a grant confirmed on 23 May 1413 by Henry V. The accession of Henry V made no obvious alteration to Scrope's position. In 1413 he was sent on diplomatic missions to Paris, Leulinghem, and Calais, and in 1414 he was involved in negotiating the crucial alliance with the Burgundians. In February 1415 he attended the council meeting at which the arrangements for Henry V's forthcoming expedition to France were discussed, though he absented himself from the council meeting of 27 May 1415 for no apparent reason.<br>
<br>Henry Scrope's career in royal service ended unexpectedly on 6 August 1415 when he was executed for high treason in Southampton on the eve of Henry V's Agincourt campaign. His head was dispatched to York and displayed on Micklegate Bar, a particular humiliation since the family held property on Micklegate. Scrope's involvement in the &#145;Southampton plot&#146; has never been fully explained. There were no obvious signs of disaffection towards Henry V, and no evidence that the king was neglecting him. Earlier in 1415 Scrope had made an indenture to serve with the king in France, and in his will he bequeathed to the king an image of the Virgin and asked him to be a good lord to his mother, his wife, and his heir. Scrope's implication in the plot is most likely to have been the result of his close family and financial ties with the other plotters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23502/', "Richard, earl of Cambridge")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19344/', "Edmund (V) Mortimer, earl of March")</script>, and Sir Thomas Grey. Once the plot was discovered he claimed that he had intended to reveal it, but had not done so by the time the earl of March himself betrayed the conspirators to the king. He may, however, have felt that his prospects might improve if the younger and more easily influenced earl of March were on the throne.<br>
<br>Scrope had made a will before his anticipated departure for France which is revealing both in its religious sentiments and as evidence of his wealth. The austere tone of its preamble was probably due less to Lollard sympathies, for which there is no evidence, than to the serious nature of his religious commitments. As well as works by the Yorkshire mystic Richard Rolle&#151;the <span class="italic">Incendium amoris</span> and <span class="italic">Judice me Deus</span>&#151;he owned copies of the <span class="italic">Revelations of St Bridget</span>, the <span class="italic">Prick of Conscience</span>, and a primer with the matins of the Blessed Virgin Mary in English. Ownership of such books placed Scrope in the van of contemporary tastes. He was extremely generous in his gifts to religious houses, and especially to hermits and anchorites. His bequests to St Bridlington Priory may have been partly a family tradition, but are likely to have been stimulated by the new cult of St John of Bridlington (<i>d</i>. 1379), who had been canonized in 1401 largely through the efforts of Scrope's uncle Archbishop Richard Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1405). Scrope himself had anticipated burial in an alabaster tomb in York Minster, where members of his family were afterwards buried.<br>
<br>Precise estimates of Scrope's wealth are difficult to make, but it is revealing that he should have tried to settle &pound;2000 on his second wife, Joan, in lieu of her claim on his estate, while in 1413 he claimed to have been robbed of goods to the value of &pound;5000. In his will he made numerous cash gifts to religious houses, relatives, and members of his household, while the inventory of his goods enumerates hundreds of ecclesiastical vestments.<br>
<br>Henry Scrope married twice, first, by 1399, Philippa Brian (<i>d</i>. 1406), and second, by July 1411, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1434), the widow successively of Edmund, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1402), and William, Lord Willoughby (<i>d</i>. 1409). There were no children of either marriage, and Scrope's heir was the third of his four brothers, John (<i>d</i>. 1455), who had succeeded to the barony by 1426. Nevertheless, Scrope's execution in 1415 effectively destroyed the economic and territorial power base of his family. His estates were forfeit to the crown, and were rapidly granted to Henry V's more loyal supporters. The North Riding estates were granted to Lord Fitzhugh, but there was some doubt as to whether they had been entailed or not, and it was on this basis that John Scrope commenced a lengthy lawsuit for their recovery in 1424. Although the sentence of forfeiture for treason was never reversed, John Scrope finally obtained the permanent recovery of the lands in 1442, when he paid William Fitzhugh &pound;1000 in return for them.<br>
