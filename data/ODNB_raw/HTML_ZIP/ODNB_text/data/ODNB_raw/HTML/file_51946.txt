<span class="headword">Moore, Sir  Norman</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1922), <span class="occ">physician and Irish scholar</span>, was born at Higher Broughton, Manchester, on 8 January 1847, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19146/', "Robert Ross Rowan Moore (1811&#150;1864)")</script>, barrister and political economist, of Kilmainham, Dublin, and his wife, Rebecca (1819&#150;1905), daughter of Benjamin Clarke Fisher, a Quaker of Lifford, co. Tipperary. Robert Moore, a campaigner with Cobden and Bright against slavery and the corn laws, left his wife before his son's birth. Moore was brought up by his mother, supported by her circle of Manchester Liberal nonconformist friends. She ran a Froebel kindergarten until her retirement in 1877.<br>
<br>Moore left Chorlton high school at fourteen to work in a cotton mill, then attended Owens College, 1862&#150;5, to study for London matriculation. From both choice and necessity he explored much of northern England and Ireland on foot. A Manchester friend recalled him &#145;leaving my house at midnight, a hawk on his wrist, to walk the 50 miles to Lancaster&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 16 Dec 1922). At fourteen Moore undertook his first long walking tour in Ireland, a country for whose people, history, and language he had an intense attachment, perhaps to replace the father he admired but never met. He spoke Irish fluently, having learned the rudiments in childhood from an Irish shoemaker in Manchester, and achieved an international reputation as an Irish scholar and historian. In 1863 Moore visited Walton Hall, Wakefield, to see the natural history collection of the explorer Charles Waterton, author of <span class="italic">Wanderings in South America</span> (1825). A friendship ensued which influenced the boy profoundly. Waterton regarded him as a second son, and Moore was with him when he died in 1865.<br>
<br>From 1865 to 1868 Moore read natural science at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he formed lifelong friendships with Charles Darwin's son Francis, and the Revd Whitwell Elwin, rector of Booton, Norfolk, among others. A former editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, Elwin gave Moore valuable introductions to the literary world, including the publishers John Murray, father and son, Leslie Stephen, and W. J. Craig, the Shakespearian scholar. Moore's natural history interest was encouraged by the zoologist Professor Alfred Newton, the anti-Darwinian Professor Richard Owen, and by Charles Darwin. Having gained an eight-year residential scholarship at St Catharine's, Moore was invited by George Murray Humphry, the anatomy professor, to help establish the Cambridge school of science. However, the master, the Revd C. K. Robinson (notorious for having voted himself into office), unjustly rusticated Moore after a minor scuffle in hall. Elwin initiated a vigorous pamphlet war and Moore was allowed to sit the tripos, but lost his scholarship. In 1869 he enrolled at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, to study comparative anatomy. A year later he wrote to Elwin's son &#145;The sages have decided I am to give up science and stick to medicine&#146;. In 1909 St Catharine's made him an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Moore obtained his MD in 1876. His thesis, <span class="italic">The Causes and Treatment of Rickets</span>, noted the value of cod-liver oil, foreshadowing the discovery of vitamins. At St Bartholomew's he was warden of the college from 1873 to 1891, lecturer in anatomy, pathology, and medicine, and physician to the hospital in 1902. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1877. He visited Ireland annually, increasing his already extensive knowledge of its language and history. He corresponded with Owen on bone cancer in deer, with Francis Darwin on electrical impulses in plants, with Standish Hayes O'Grady on ancient Irish texts, and learned palaeography from Henry Bradshaw, Cambridge University librarian. He published a life of Waterton in a new edition of his <span class="italic">Essays in Natural History</span> (1871); <span class="italic">The Loss of the Crown of Loegaire Lurc</span>, a translation from the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span> (1881); and in 1882 a translation from the German of Windisch's <span class="italic">Concise Irish Grammar</span>. In 1876 Leslie Stephen asked Moore to contribute to a new project, a dictionary of national biography, for which Moore wrote 459 lives. Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood VC, another lifelong friend (and patient), fostered his interest in military history. Moore's son recorded that &#145;next to native Irish speakers &amp; well-read old ladies, he most enjoyed meeting &amp; listening to military men of mark&#146;.<br>
<br>One of Rebecca Moore's friends was Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, cousin of Florence Nightingale, a founder of Girton College, and campaigner for women's rights. She introduced Moore to artists and writers: H. B. Brabazon, William de Morgan, the Rossettis, Helen and William Allingham, George Eliot, and Mme Belloc and her children, Hilaire and Marie. In 1876 Moore proposed to Barbara Bodichon's seventeen-year-old niece Amy Leigh Smith (1859&#150;1901), who accepted. Her parents objected, forbidding all communication. When they eventually relented Norman and Amy were married by Elwin at Westfield, Sussex, on 30 March 1880. They lived in the Warden's House, Little Britain, West Smithfield, until 1891, then at 94 Gloucester Place, west London. They had two sons, Alan Hilary (1882&#150;1959) and Gillachrist (1894&#150;1914), who was killed in the first battle of Ypres, and a daughter, Ethne Philippa (1885&#150;1968). Moore was a skilled pathologist, diagnostician, and teacher. His casebooks show that he complemented physical examination with conversation about the patient's work and daily life. He advised students to remember that medicine concerned the &#145;whole man&#146;. Moore was instrumental in establishing medical education in the restructured University of London, first through the royal commission, later on the board of advanced medical studies. In 1900 Amy, who was dying of tuberculosis, converted to Roman Catholicism. Moore, though a nonconformist by upbringing and an Anglican by inclination, followed her. He was devout but disliked discussing theology. &#145;If they teach what is ridiculous you don't believe it&#146;  (private information). Amy died on 25 August 1901, and in 1903 Moore married her first cousin, Milicent Ludlow (1868&#150;1947).<br>
<br>Moore, a short, fair haired, bearded man, never smoked and rarely drank. He was considered a fascinating conversationalist, though some found the flow of talk overwhelming. His enemies were few, but powerful. In 1915 he was unexpectedly defeated for the presidency of the Royal College of Physicians. A grudging and inaccurate <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary said his work &#145;lacked that deeper scholarship&#146; which would &#145;render it lasting&#146;. M. R. James, provost of Eton College, refuted this, adding &#145;I have never met any man whose erudition was so varied, lay so ready to hand, or was so delightfully enlivened by human and humorous touches&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Dec 1922).<br>
<br>Moore inspired lifelong and devoted friendship among a wide circle in all walks of life. He had two happy marriages; he was amused and amusing. &#145;His laughter was accompanied by a moistening of the eyes&#146;, wrote E. V. Lucas, &#145;which his friends found very well worth striving after&#146;  (private information). He impressed and delighted children by reciting all the rhyming page headings in Thackeray's <span class="italic">The Rose and the Ring</span>. A friend's small daughter recalled the joy of his visits: &#145;He made the very dullest subject amusing, because to him nothing was dull, and he had the power of taking away the dullness from the person he was talking to&#146;  (private information). Moore's circle of &#145;well-read ladies&#146; included the gardening expert Ellen Willmott, and the scholarly Ethel Portal, a close friend who helped with his research.<br>
<br>On retirement in 1911 Moore was appointed consulting physician to St Bartholomew's, emeritus lecturer in medicine, and hospital governor. He published numerous papers, served on medical and educational committees, was secretary of the Literary Society, and librarian of the Royal Society of Medicine (1899&#150;1918). At the Royal College of Physicians he became Harveian librarian, served on its conjoint board, and for twenty-one years represented the college on the General Medical Council, where he supported the interests of patients rather than the profession. He was the 1901 Harveian orator, and was elected senior censor in 1908. His many official lectures included the Linacre (<span class="italic">The Physician in English History</span>, 1913), Lumleian, Bradshaw, FitzPatrick (<span class="italic">The History of the Study of Medicine in the British Isles</span>, 1908), and Hunterian, and in 1914 the Cambridge Rede lecture, all of which were published. In 1918 Moore&#151;&#145;the then pre-eminent British physician&#146;  (Linnett, 15)&#151;became president of the Royal College of Physicians and a trustee of the British Museum. His monumental <span class="italic">History of St Bartholomew's Hospital</span>, in two volumes, was published the same year. He read, and copied by hand, nearly 1000 medieval charters, and would walk the ancient City streets at night to reconstruct its links with twelfth-century London.<br>
<br>Moore was created a baronet in 1919 and in 1920 received an honorary LLD from Cambridge. His powers began to decline, his writing showing early signs of Parkinsonism. The war had aged him: he never wholly recovered from the loss of his younger son, Gillachrist. On 30 November 1922 he died at his wife's house, Hancox, Whatlington, near Battle. He was buried on 5 December in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Sedlescombe, Sussex. His son Alan succeeded him as second baronet.<br>
