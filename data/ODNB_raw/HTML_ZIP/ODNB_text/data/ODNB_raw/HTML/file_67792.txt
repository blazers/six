<span class="headword">Robinson,  Edmund</span>  (<em>b. </em>1622<span class="mult">x</span>4, <em>d.</em> in or after 1677), <span class="occ">witch accuser</span>, was the son of Edmund Robinson (also known as Edmund Rough, alias Robinson), a mason or waller of Wheatley Lane in the chapelry of Newchurch in Pendle, Lancashire. His mother's name is not known; she was alive in 1634 and, he acknowledged, had brought him up to spin wool and fetch home her cattle.<br>
<br>In 1634 Robinson made allegations which led to the second major Lancashire or Pendle witch trial twenty-two years after the first and more famous trial of 1612. Edmund's age&#151;eleven according to a deposition taken on 10 February 1634, &#145;ten years or thereabouts&#146; according to a source dated 10 July 1634 (Webster, 347; <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 141)&#151;echoes the earlier case, when the star witness was the nine-year-old Jennet Device.<br>
<br>Edmund Robinson's story began on All Saints' day, 1 November 1633. He claimed that he was gathering wild plums when two greyhounds, one black, one brown, each with strings that shone like gold tied to their collars, came running up to him. When they refused to chase a hare for him he tied them to a bush to beat them, whereupon the black greyhound turned into Frances Dicconson, the wife of a neighbouring husbandman, and the brown into a little boy. Dicconson offered Robinson a piece of silver to hold his tongue, and when he refused abducted him. She put a bridle over the neck of the little boy, who now changed into a white horse. They carried Robinson to a house called Hoarstones about a quarter of a mile off, where about sixty witches were feasting, both women and men (though apparently mainly women). A young woman offered him &#145;flesh and breade upon a trencher, and drinke in a glasse, which, after the first taste, hee refused, and would have noe more, and said it was nought&#146;  (Potts, lxii). Following a group of witches to a nearby barn he saw:<blockquote>sixe of them kneelinge, and pullinge at sixe severall roapes which were fastened or tyed to the toppe of the house; at or with which pullinge came then in this informers sight flesh smaokinge, butter in lumps, and milke as it were syleinge [passing through a sieve] from the &hellip; roapes, all which fell into basons which were placed under the &hellip; roapes. (Potts, lxiii)</blockquote>When they had finished another six women took their places, all the time that they pulled making &#145;such foule faces that feared this informant&#146;  (ibid.). He saw three women take three pictures stuck with thorns down from a beam: he recognized one of them, Loynd's wife (evidently Jennet Loynd). A terrified Robinson stole away and ran home; some of the witches, Loynd's wife at the front, pursued him for a while until discouraged by the sight of two horsemen on the road.<br>
<br>Robinson arrived home as evening approached, only to be sent out again by his father to fetch home two cows. On the way he fell in with a boy who started a fight with him, &#145;and they fought soe together till this informer had his eares made very bloody by fightinge, and lookinge downe, hee sawe the boy had a cloven foote&#146;  (Potts, lxiv). He fled towards what he thought was a friendly light, only to find it was Loynd's wife standing on a bridge; turning back, he immediately ran into the boy again, who struck him a blow on the back which made him cry out. His father, who confirmed that he had sent Robinson to bring home the cattle, told how he went to look for him when he was late home and found him crying and so distracted that at first he neither recognized his father nor knew where he was and only came to himself after about a quarter of an hour.<br>
<br>Several times after that night Robinson saw Loynd's wife, Frances Dicconson, and Jennet Davies (or Device) in a close adjoining his father's house (some have identified Jennet as the witch accuser of 1612). On the Thursday after new year's day 1634 he saw Loynd's wife sitting across a beam in his father's chimney. When he called her to come down she immediately disappeared upwards.<br>
<br>The magistrates Richard Shuttleworth of Gawthorpe and John Starkie of Huntroyd took the Robinsons' statements on 10 February 1634&#151;over three months since the feast and a month after he claimed to have seen Loynd's wife in the chimney. They sent many for trial at Lancaster assizes and further accusations followed. Robinson senior claimed five months later that the magistrates had taken the initiative in the prosecution, summoning him to bring his son before them and then managing the prosecution. By July the father had good reasons to deny his own questionable part in the business, but it is plausible, and would help explain the time lag between the alleged incidents and the taking of statements&#151;that the magistrates were responding to a groundswell of rumour and anxiety that had gathered around the boy's story by the beginning of February. The Robinsons themselves played a very active part in generating such an atmosphere&#151;if not before they appeared before the magistrates, then certainly after. John Webster, then curate of Kildwick, recalled how:<blockquote>the boy, his Father and some others besides did make a practice to go from Church to Church that the Boy might reveal and discover Witches, pretending that there was a great number at the pretended meeting whose faces he could know, and by that means they got a good living. (Webster, 277)</blockquote>When Webster attempted to confront the boy his minders prevented him from answering.<br>
<br>At the assizes many of the accused (different sources give seventeen, nineteen, or twenty-one) were found guilty. A list of twenty &#145;accused and condemned&#146; noted the individual charges of <i>maleficium</i>&#151;acts of harm wreaked on persons or animals&#151;for which these women and men had been convicted, and the evidence of the marks found on their bodies after intimate body searches which confirmed that they were witches. These were the accusations which, without Robinson's story to provide a focus, might have remained matters of local gossip and suspicion and never come to court: that Frances Dicconson had haunted Edmund Stevenson when he lay sick; that Jennet Hargreaves had caused the death of two women and of the foetus of another; that Jennet Loynd had killed the son of Edmund Higgins and various farm animals, for instance laying a hand on a cow of Sharpee Smith's which had never risen again. The judge, however, was dissatisfied with the evidence and wrote to the king. In May the privy council ordered John Bridgeman, bishop of Chester, to examine seven of the accused and send them to London, together with the Robinsons. Three had already died in gaol, among them Jennet Loynd. The bishop was sceptical: &#145;Conceit and malice are so powerful with many in those parts, that they will easily afford an oath to work revenge upon their neighbours&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 78). Frances Dicconson claimed that the accusations against her were revenge for a dispute over a cow which her husband had sold to Robinson's father but then refused to turn over without a bond guaranteeing that he would be paid for it. Moreover, she claimed that Robinson senior had promised that he would see that she got off, that neither his son nor he would testify against her, if they paid him 40<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>In July examinations by midwives and surgeons (including the king's physician William Harvey) failed to find any witch's marks on the accused. George Long, a Middlesex magistrate acting on the instructions of the secretary of state, Windebank, twice examined separately both Edmund junior and senior. The boy retracted his allegations, admitting that &#145;the tale is false and feigned, and has no truth at all, but only as he has heard tales and reports made by women, so he framed the tale out of his own invention&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 141). Having heard tales of the great witch feast at Malkin Tower in the 1612 case, he had initially fabricated stories about people who had a reputation as witches to avoid a beating because he had been at play instead of bringing home his mother's cattle, &#145;but perceiving that many folks gave ear to him he grew confident in it more and more&#146;  (ibid., 153).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Robinson's father denied accusation of blackmail, or that he had prosecuted or testified against Frances Dicconson or any of the witches. Indeed, he had never believed his son's story, only that the boy had had a vision which disturbed him. Now a prisoner in the Gatehouse gaol, he claimed that he was himself the victim of a vexatious prosecution. In July 1634 young Robinson denied that he had been put up by anyone to make his accusations, but he later admitted to John Webster that he had done so at his father's instigation.<br>
<br>Margaret Johnson, a widow from Marsden aged sixty, had admitted her guilt to Bishop Bridgeman, and named others. Moreover, the convictions for <i>maleficium</i> may have survived the utter discrediting of Edmund Robinson's tale of the great feast at Hoarstones and the failure of the London searchers to find witches' marks on those they had inspected. For whatever reason, ten of the convicted were still in Lancaster gaol in August 1636. Among them were three of the four brought to London two years earlier: Mary Spencer, Jennet Hargreaves, and Frances Dicconson herself.<br>
<br>Robinson's accusations had quickly gained a notoriety wider than his corner of east Lancashire. In May Sir William Pelham from Lincolnshire wrote: &#145;The greatest news from the country is of a huge pack of witches which are lately discovered in Lancashire.&#146; Echoing stories of the North Berwick witches and their supposed conjuring against James VI he reported: &#145;It is suspected that they had a great hand in raising the great storm wherein his Majesty was in so great danger at sea in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 26). At The Hague in June the exiled Elizabeth of Bohemia quizzed her visitor, the Cheshire gentleman Sir William Brereton, about &#145;the discovery of our Lancashire witches&#146;  (Brereton, 33). Even while the decisions of the privy council were pending, Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome put on at the Globe their play, <span class="italic">The Late Lancashire Witches</span>, &#145;a well received Comedy&#146; performed in July and published in October 1634 (title-page). This used the names of the witches who had been brought down to London and the playwrights clearly had access to copies of official papers: alongside their comic inventions they drew in some detail on the testimonies of Robinson and Margaret Johnson. Robinson's account is closely echoed in scenes which include the transformation of the greyhounds, the abduction, and the escape from the feast.<br>
<br>In 1677 John Webster, in <span class="italic">The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft</span>, cited Robinson's accusations to support his sceptical attitude towards demonological beliefs and towards accounts based on the evidence of at best fallible, at worst corrupt, eyewitnesses. At that time Robinson, by then known as Ned of Roughs, was still alive. It is not known when he died.<br>
