<span class="headword">Bloor,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">ceramicist</span>, was probably born at Church Gresley, Derbyshire, where many of his family are buried. He worked as a clerk for the Old Derby China Works for several years before buying the firm for &pound;5000 in 1811, from Michael Kean and the younger William Duesbury. Under his management sales increased and at its height the firm employed as many as fifty painters, as well as a great number of potters, burnishers, apprentices, and female staff. It is generally considered that the former high quality and finished decoration of the Derby ware deteriorated while he was proprietor. He organized large scale auctions of stock which had accumulated in the factory, some of it either old or faulty, which simultaneously flooded the market and lowered public perceptions of Derby ware. However, according to Geoffrey Godden and John Twitchett some fine painters were employed during this period and superb quality porcelains were produced. It was during Bloor's proprietorship that the &#145;Japan&#146; or Imari pattern wares which are associated with Royal Crown Derby were first produced, often painted by women. Examples of work from the Bloor period are preserved at the Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, and the Royal Crown Derby Museum.<br>
<br>In 1828 Bloor suffered a mental breakdown from which he never recovered. James Thomason took over the running of the business until 1844. Robert Bloor died at Hathern in Leicestershire on 11 March 1846. The factory was taken over by his granddaughter, Mrs Thomas Clarke, who sold the concern to Samuel Boyle. The business failed and the Nottingham Road factory closed in 1848. <a name="cosubject_2677"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Bloor</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1846)<span class="occ"></span> was the brother of Robert Bloor. He was engaged at the works in sundry capacities, mainly in mixing &#145;bodies&#146; for the paste. He died in 1846.<br>
