<span class="headword">Macaulay,  Aulay</span>  (1758&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Lismore, Argyll, on 20 October 1758, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17347/', "John Macaulay (1720&#150;1789)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17350/', "Macaulay, Zachary")</script>], Church of Scotland minister, and his second wife, Margaret Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1790). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17350/', "Zachary Macaulay")</script> was his brother and Thomas Babington Macaulay was his nephew. He was educated at home and then at Glasgow University, whence he graduated MA in 1778. While in residence he contributed to <span class="italic">Ruddiman's Magazine</span> under the pseudonym Academicus. After acting for three years as tutor to the sons of Joseph Foster Barham at Bedford he took holy orders in the Church of England and obtained a curacy at Claybrooke, Leicestershire, in 1781. He remained there until 1789, when he was appointed rector of Frolesworth, in the same county, but he resigned that living in 1790. In 1785 he had been admitted at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, to study divinity but, although he completed the course, he decided against the expense of graduation.<br>
<br>In 1793 Macaulay went on a tour in Holland and Belgium, writing an account of his travels for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1793&#150;4). In 1794, as travelling tutor to one of the sons of Sir Walter Farquhar, he visited the court of the duke of Brunswick and gave English lessons to his daughter, afterwards Queen Caroline, in the course of which he gained the regard of her mother, the duchess. In 1796, after his return, Macaulay was presented by his brother-in-law Thomas Babington MP to the living of Rothley in Leicestershire. He married Ann Heyrick (<i>bap</i>. 1774), daughter of John Heyrick, town clerk of Leicester, and his wife, Mary, at St Margaret's, Leicester, on 19 September 1797. In 1815 he made another tour on the continent, again publishing accounts in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1815&#150;17).<br>
<br>Macaulay spent over thirty years working on a life of Melancthon but this massive project was never published. He also considered editing an abridged version of Alexander Pope's works. His own published works include <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1780), <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of Claybrooke</span>, which was published separately as well as in John Nichols's <span class="italic">Queries Proposed to the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy, of Leicestershire</span> (1787?), and sermons recommending the Anglican liturgy and Sunday schools. He died of apoplexy on 24 February 1819 and was survived by his wife and eight sons. He should not be confused with Aulay Macaulay (1673&#150;1758), father of Kenneth Macaulay.<br>
<br>Macaulay's second son, <a name="cosubject_17345"></a><span class="headword">Colin Campbell Macaulay</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1800, <em>d.</em> 1853), <span class="occ">solicitor and historian</span>, was baptized at Rothley on 7 January 1800. Having been educated at Rugby School he travelled in Portugal, and in 1831 he became partner in a firm of solicitors at Leicester. He was president of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1847 and 1848, and contributed historical papers on Cardinal Wolsey (1849), the duke of Marlborough (1850), and Queen Elizabeth (1851). On 30 April 1850 he married Mary Kendall Wood, eldest daughter of Richard Warner Wood; they had a son and a daughter. He died on 20 October 1853 at Knighton Lodge, Leicester, and was buried at Rothley.<br>
