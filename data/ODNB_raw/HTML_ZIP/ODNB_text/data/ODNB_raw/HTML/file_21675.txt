<span class="headword">Peacock,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a native of Ipswich, and probably the son of James Peacock of that town, mariner, who was listed in 1617 and 1629 as a younger brother of Trinity House. The younger James Peacock appears to have begun his career as a merchant captain and is mentioned as captain and part owner of the <i>Dragon</i> collier which served parliament in 1642&#150;5, but may then have been dropped, possibly because it had proved to be a &#145;heavy sailer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Humble Remonstrance of Andrewes Burrell</span>, Thomason Tracts). He was commander of the 5th-rate <i>Warwick</i> in 1646 and in 1647 commanded a squadron of five ships in the North Sea. He was then promoted to the new 4th-rate frigate, the <i>Tiger</i>, which between October and December patrolled the waters around the Isle of Wight while the king was confined in Carisbrooke Castle.<br>
<br>During the second civil war in 1648, when much of the parliamentary fleet revolted to the king, Peacock remained loyal to parliament. He took an important part in the siege of Colchester, helping to capture Mersea Island Fort and defeating a sally aimed at recapturing shipping in the river. He then joined the earl of Warwick in the Thames, was present at the confrontation with the royalist fleet and helped blockade it in Goree later in the year.<br>
<br>During 1649 Peacock again commanded the <i>Tiger</i> and a small squadron in the North Sea, capturing at least three prizes. He also had to suppress a mutiny over pay, for which a naval official held him partly to blame, accusing him of being &#145;too uxorious&#146; and of &#145;lying ashore with his wife&#146;  (Worcester College, Oxford, Clarke MS 4/4/18). In 1650 the <i>Tiger</i> went with Blake to Portugal in pursuit of Prince Rupert. Peacock's predatory instincts were again in evidence when he captured a Portuguese man-of-war under the guns of Fort St Julian. The last mention of the <i>Tiger</i> was on 22 July, suggesting that Peacock had returned home with Badiley's squadron just before Rupert's escape. On 17 January 1651 he and his crew were paid a gratuity for their good service, which probably related to the capture of the privateer the <i>Crowned lion</i>, and he was also awarded a gold medal and chain to the value of &pound;50. In February 1651 he sailed for the Mediterranean with the squadron under Captain Edward Hall. There are no direct references either to Peacock or the <i>Tiger</i> during the expedition and he was back in Tilbury Hope on 1 October. He then returned to his old beat in the North Sea, among other things convoying &pound;80,000 to the army in Scotland.<br>
<br>Peacock was still in command of the <i>Tiger</i> when the First Anglo-Dutch War broke out. His ship was among those in the Downs on 7 June and he was commended by Blake for his capture of a Flemish privateer three days later. His assignment to North Sea convoy duties once more makes it unlikely that he was present at the battles of Kentish Knock and Dungeness but his capture of twenty prizes made a great impression and he was promised command of a squadron to be sent to the Mediterranean although, in the event, the expedition was abandoned. The respect with which he was by now held was demonstrated by his selection as one of six officers who drew up a revised fleet plan after Dungeness. In the subsequent reorganization he was assigned to the newly launched 3rd-rate frigate, the <i>Rainbow</i>, and made vice-admiral of the White squadron. On the first day of the battle of Portland, 16&#150;18 February 1653, the White squadron was the last to engage and so Peacock missed the heaviest fighting. Shortly afterwards he was one of three officers chosen to present a petition for the adequate compensation of the widows and orphans of officers and seamen killed in battle, and the provision of proper facilities for the sick and wounded. After Portland he shifted his flag to the <i>Triumph</i> and fought in her at the battle of the Gabbard on 2&#150;4 June 1653 where his casualties amounted to only one killed and two wounded. His luck ran out at the last battle off Scheveningen on 29&#150;31 July, however, where he was mortally wounded, dying a few days later, about 4 August. He left a widow, Mary, and five children, to whom parliament voted &pound;750 vested in Ipswich trustees and to be paid there.<br>
