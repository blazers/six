<span class="headword">Hobart, Sir  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1517), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Monks Eleigh in Suffolk, the son of Thomas Hobart. He trained at Lincoln's Inn, and gave his second law reading in Lent 1479. Between Michaelmas 1486 and Michaelmas 1506 he was elected annually as the senior governor, and lent the inn significant sums of money to rebuild its hall. Hobart seems initially to have lived at Bacton in Suffolk; appointed a JP for the county in 1466, he sat for Ipswich in the parliaments of 1467&#150;8, 1478, and January 1483. In 1482 he switched to the Norfolk commission of the peace, probably as a result of moving his major residence to Hales Hall, Loddon.<br>
<br>Hobart's principal early clients were the Mowbray dukes of Norfolk and he continued to serve Elizabeth, the dowager duchess, until her death in 1506. By 1463, however, he was also being employed by Sir John Howard, the future first Howard duke. Hobart appears in the Paston letters as the servant of both families (as well as a personal friend of John (III) Paston). Steward for Howard's Suffolk estates, Hobart was also his principal legal adviser, and one of the retinue. In 1484 he promised to supply at his own expense three armed men for the force that the newly elevated duke was raising for Richard III, and in addition &#145;to gete hym as many men as he can gete&#146;  (Collier, 2.481). Hobart was also feed by Richard himself.<br>
<br>Given this history it is surprising that James Hobart was not dropped as a JP after Bosworth with other Howard supporters, and even more that on 3 November 1486 Henry VII appointed him as attorney-general, the law officer closest to the monarch. Influence must be presumed&#151;either the earl of Oxford (another client), or more probably Thomas Lovell, also of Norfolk and Lincoln's Inn, and a professional colleague.<br>
<br>Hobart rapidly became one of Henry VII's principal courtiers and counsellors. As attorney-general he oversaw all the courts of law, and was a major agent of the king's policy &#145;to keep all Englishmen obedient through fear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 127). Promoting all and any litigation from which the king could profit, his methods were none too principled. Particularly important were cases where royal rights could be elaborated by judicial construction, such as <i>Stonor's case</i> (1495&#150;6). Perkin Warbeck certainly had some grounds for stigmatizing Hobart in 1496 as one of &#145;the catiffs and villains of simple birth whom the king alone trusted&#146; and whose &#145;subtle inventions and pilling of the people&#146; were the &#145;principal occasions of misrule and mischief now in England&#146;  (Pollard, 2.153). From 1500 Hobart joined with a handful of the king's other leading advisers on a special board, known as &#145;the council learned in the law&#146;, which maximized royal profit by every device of law and pressure, and assisted the king in manipulating the bonds and recognizances through which Henry sought to ensnare individuals and families in a web of indebtedness to the crown.<br>
<br>Hobart was an equally vigorous agent of the royal council on the local scene&#151;which explains Norwich's selecting him in 1496 as its recorder! In Suffolk Sir James (as he became on 18 February 1503) sat as a JP more often than anyone else (he was probably <i>custos rotulorum</i>), and returned a disproportionate number of cases involving royal rights. Hobart also had the common lawyer's suspicion of the church and its courts. He encouraged defendants to bring charges against clerical judges under the <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Praemunire</i></span> (1393), and construed the promise of costs to informers under a <span class="roman">Riotous Assembly Act</span> of 1495 as applying to the act of 1393. In 1505 the attorney-general even brought a charge of <i>praemunire</i> against the bishop of Norwich, Richard Nix, who urged William Warham, archbishop of Canterbury and lord chancellor, to excommunicate Hobart as &#145;the enemy of God and his churche&#146;  (Gunn, 16).<br>
<br>It has been suggested that the high-profile Nix prosecution led to Hobart's resignation or dismissal in 1507. John Erneley, his successor as attorney-general, was appointed on 12 July. The change, however, signalled no relaxation of royal pressure on the church, and it is more probable that Hobart left in the normal way and on account of age. He had ceased to ride the assizes in 1503. By 1507 he was in his middle or late sixties, and four days before Erneley's appointment he had sued out a replacement copy of his own patent&#151;a step typical of a royal servant about to hand over office. The crown continued to summon him to the Lords (as it had when he was attorney-general).<br>
<br>It is possibly another sign of a desire to withdraw from active life that about 1500 Hobart and his third wife put in hand major works of charity. He assisted&#151;probably completed&#151;Bishop Goldwell's choir in Norwich Cathedral, and constructed at his own expense a parish church for Loddon. Lady Hobart built the bridge over the Waveney at St Olave's with an adjacent causeway. She was Margaret, daughter of Piers Naunton of Letheringham, widow of John Dorward, and the mother of the sons Walter and Miles and daughter Katherine who survived Sir James. The estates he purchased, principally in Norfolk, were substantial&#151;sufficient to endow both sons. Hobart's first wife, whom he had married before 1470, had been Margery, the sister of John Lyhert and niece of Walter Lyhert, bishop of Norwich. Hobart named his son and heir after Lyhert, for whom he was an executor (as also for Bishop Goldwell, Lyhert's successor). His second wife was Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Glemham. Sir James died on 24 February 1517 and was buried in a chapel he built on the north side of the nave of Norwich Cathedral but the chapel has not survived, nor have his tomb and military brass. A number of painted panels exist, showing Sir James in armour with a heraldic tabard, and his wife in a heraldic mantle (for instance at Blickling Hall, Loddon church, and Lincoln's Inn).<br>
