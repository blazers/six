<span class="headword">Atwood <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>South]</span>,  Mary Anne</span>  (1817&#150;1910), <span class="occ">interpreter of alchemy</span>, was born at Dieppe in 1817, the daughter of Thomas South (<i>c</i>.1785&#150;1855), gentleman, of Bury House, Gosport, Hampshire, and his wife, Elise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maurice. She received no formal education but became proficient in Latin and Greek and developed a &#145;rare and extraordinary knowledge of the classics&#146;  (Steiger, 190). Under the influence of her father she joined the circle of theosophists (in the sense of students of the German mystic Jakob Boehme) around James Pierrepont Greaves (1777&#150;1842), developed an enthusiasm for mesmerism, and began her profound study of alchemy.<br>
<br>Thomas South and his daughter conducted their researches together and first set out their ideas in 1846 in a joint work entitled <span class="italic">Early Magnetism in its Higher Relations to Humanity as Veiled in the Poets and the Prophets</span>, under the pseudonym Thuos Mathos. Later in life she dismissed the book as &#145;a mere enthusiastic production&#146;  (Atwood, 4), but it was well received and encouraged the authors to work on a project of much greater significance&#151;a detailed explanation of the true nature and purpose of the alchemical process. Their original intention was to publish two works, a long, epic poem, <span class="italic">The Enigma of Alchemy</span>, by the father and a study in prose by the daughter. The poem never appeared (save for a fragment printed in volume 10 of <span class="italic">The Quest</span> in 1919), but Mary Anne's <span class="italic">A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery</span> was published in 1850&#151;to be almost immediately withdrawn, and all but a few copies destroyed.<br>
<br>The sole reason for this expensive act of suppression was the Souths' joint conviction that they had made a serious error of judgement in revealing to the world a great secret that should rightly remain veiled within allegorical texts. In 1855 Thomas South died, his daughter's book forgotten, save in esoteric circles, and in 1859 Mary Anne South married the Revd Alban Thomas Atwood (1813&#150;1883), moving with him to the house he had built in lieu of a vicarage at Knayton in Leake, near Thirsk in Yorkshire. Here she remained as a virtual recluse until her death on 13 April 1910. She did, however, maintain her esoteric associations, and through Anna Kingsford, Isabelle de Steiger, and A. P. Sinnett, to whom she gave most of her impressive alchemical library, she came to know&#151;and ultimately to reject as anti-Christian&#151;H. P. Blavatsky's Theosophical Society. She also continued her alchemical researches and, encouraged by Mme. de Steiger, altered her views on re-issuing her <span class="italic">Suggestive Inquiry</span> and extensively revised the text. It was eventually published, edited by W. L. Wilmshurst, in 1918, but its influence had been felt much earlier, notably on A. E. Waite who described it as an &#145;epoch-making book&#146;  (Waite, <span class="italic">Azoth</span>, 76). However Waite rejected as too extreme her thesis that true alchemy is exclusively spiritual, a science of the soul through which the adept seeks divine union by way of a personal illumination gained in an exalted form of mesmeric trance. Waite's view has attracted much support but without the stimulus of the <span class="italic">Suggestive Inquiry</span>, scholarly research into alchemical texts would have been delayed for decades. Mary Anne Atwood was buried in Knayton in Leake churchyard.<br>
