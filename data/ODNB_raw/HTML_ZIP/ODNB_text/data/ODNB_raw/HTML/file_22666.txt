<span class="headword">Power,  Joseph</span>  (1798&#150;1868), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was the fifth son of John Power MD, of Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, where he was born on 5 October 1798. He entered Clare College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1817, and in 1821 he graduated as tenth wrangler. In 1823 he was elected a fellow of his college. On 13 June 1824 he was ordained deacon at Norwich. But as there was no teaching post available at Clare, in 1829 he removed to Trinity Hall, a society then dominated by the study of civil law. There he taught mathematics, and acted as one of two tutors, until he was able to return to a vacancy in his first college in 1844.<br>
<br>In 1845, on the resignation of John Lodge, the university librarian, on account of ill health, Power was put forward to succeed him. In an unusually hard-fought election, in which his ultimate opponent was J. J. Smith of Gonville and Caius College, a prominent figure in local antiquarian circles and well known for his industry as well as for his outspokenness, wits spoke of a choice between work without power and power without work. Power was elected, and remained in office until he resigned in 1864. Lodge had transformed the library, overseeing the erection of the new Cockerell building and a great increase in the numbers of books acquired. Power, more relaxed, left a reputation that suffered further at the tongues and pens of his successors J. E. B. Mayor and Henry Bradshaw. Nevertheless, under his eye (albeit at a time when the library was run more by the university than by the librarian) the staff was increased; arrangements were made, with the advice of Antonio Panizzi, for the more efficient gathering of copyright deposit books under the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1842; reforms in the library's management pre-empted the recommendations of the Cambridge University commissioners' report of 1852; the first volume of a printed catalogue of manuscripts appeared in 1856; an extension was erected, to the designs of George Gilbert Scott; and, not least importantly, Henry Bradshaw was appointed to care for the manuscripts and early printed books.<br>
<br>Corpulent and sociable, Power preferred Cambridge society to travel. His published work consisted mainly of various mathematical papers contributed to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. In 1856 he was presented to the Clare College living of Litlington, Cambridgeshire, which he held until 1866, when the college presented him to the richer living (of which it had bought the advowson in 1836) of Birdbrook, Essex. He remained rector until his death there, after prolonged illness, on 7 June 1868. He never married, and was buried at Birdbrook.<br>
