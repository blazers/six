<span class="headword">Huddleston,  Robert</span>  (1814&#150;1887), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Moneyreagh, co. Down, the son of a small farmer. Few details can be ascertained concerning his upbringing and early life. His marital status is uncertain: though he frequently adopts the persona of the young (or not so young) suitor, at least one semi-autobiographical poem, &#145;Epistle to Mr John Pettigrew&#146;, mentions an &#145;auld guid dame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs on Different Subjects</span>, 51). He had little formal schooling, having attended a local school in Moneyreagh for only a few years, and is at pains to point out that he is no scholar and that standard literary English is not his natural medium: &#145;I can neither read Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or French. Thank my stars, I can read English a kind of a way, but to write it correctly, I fear, I would blunder&#146;  (ibid., x). Far from this proving an impediment, he professes to prefer &#145;the common-place illiterate school learning of a mere homely peasant&#146; to the attainments of &#145;highly educated gentlemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs on Rural Subjects</span>, iv). Thus his work possesses the eccentricity characteristic of the autodidact.<br>
<br>From the early 1840s Huddleston began to contribute poems to local newspapers and periodicals. In 1843 he issued a florid prospectus and began to solicit subscriptions. His first volume, <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems and Songs on Rural Subjects</span>, appeared the following year, but a disagreement with his publisher over the printing costs followed, when some subscribers defaulted. Undaunted, he saw a second volume through the press in 1846, <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems and Songs on Different Subjects</span>. This too met with a lukewarm reception. Disillusioned by the fact that his poetic genius had not been recognized, he turned his attentions to prose, planning to rival William Carleton as a great Ulster novelist. He was following the example of the Larne poet James McHenry (1785&#150;1845), who had published successful novels in Philadelphia before returning to Belfast. In 1860 Huddleston issued a prospectus for a work entitled <span class="italic">The Adventures of Hughey Funny, or, The many Tales of Love</span>, but once again quarrelled with his publisher. He turned again to poetry and contributed a few poems in the <span class="italic">Ulster Magazine</span> (1860&#150;63), but much of his work after 1846 remains unpublished.<br>
<br>According to J. Hewitt, Huddleston was one of the last folk-bards of Ulster  (Hewitt, 54). He was a strong defender of the use of vernacular Ulster Scots, which he termed &#145;Ulster Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs on Rural Subjects</span>, ix). He was equally vehement in his rejection of the charge of imitating Robert Burns. Never one to exercise false modesty, he believed that Burns was overestimated to the same degree that Huddleston was underestimated. &#145;Though I may not be a Robert Burns to the lowland Scottish peasantry, let me hope, at least, that I shall one day be a Robert Huddleston to the Ulster Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Songs on Different Subjects</span>, xi). His uncompromising use of Ulster Scots, together with an equally uncompromising political radicalism, made it difficult for him to publish his work. Nevertheless, he was acclaimed by David Herbison and his local fellow bards as the &#145;Bard of Moneyrea&#146;, in which place he died on 15 February 1887, still lamenting his literary obscurity.<br>
