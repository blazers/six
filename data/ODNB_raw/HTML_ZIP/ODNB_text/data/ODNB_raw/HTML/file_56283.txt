<span class="headword">Nathan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Levi]</span>,  Sarina</span>  (1819&#150;1882), <span class="occ">supporter of Italian independence</span>, was born on 7 December 1819 at Pesaro on the Adriatic coast of Italy. Her father, Angelo Levi (<i>d</i>. 1859), was a merchant in the Papal States. Her mother, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ricca Rosselli, came from another family of Jewish merchants established in Leghorn and London. After her mother's early death, Sarina Levi was sent to be brought up by her cousins at Leghorn, where Jews were much less in danger of persecution and forcible conversion than in papal territory. Before her seventeenth birthday she was married at Leghorn to Meyer Moses Nathan, who was a German from Frankfurt, and the couple in 1836 or 1837 moved to London, where they took British citizenship. Before his death in 1859 Meyer had made a modest fortune as an agent on the stock exchange. All twelve of their children were born in London.<br>
<br>Giuseppe Mazzini, the Italian nationalist, met Sarina Nathan through his friendship with her London cousin Michelangelo Rosselli, since the two men used to play duets at musical evenings to which she was invited. Meeting Mazzini, as she later explained, was the most important event in her life and she became his devoted disciple, helping to finance his conspiracies. In January 1848 he first sought her help in promoting a penny subscription for Italy, and her husband at once found 200 subscribers among his colleagues in the City. One of Meyer's friends, Dr Henri Conneau, was a trusted collaborator of the French emperor, Napoleon III, and not impossibly was a source for Mazzini's astonishing knowledge about the secrets of European diplomacy.<br>
<br>Sarina Nathan returned to Italy in 1859 following her husband's death, since her eldest daughter, Janet, needed a milder climate. At Cornigliano she barely escaped arrest when the Italian police, who saw her as a dangerous revolutionary, forced entry to her house to seize books and papers, but she escaped to Switzerland. For ten years she mainly lived at Lugano, where her house, La Tanzina, became famous as a convenient centre for planning republican revolution. Mazzini was soon referring to her and Janet as his two greatest friends. In 1872 Sarina and three of her children were present when Mazzini died at Pisa in the house of Janet's husband, Pellegrino Rosselli. For the remaining ten years of her life Sarina Nathan devoted herself to the publication of Mazzini's voluminous writings, after purchasing the copyright from his sister and publisher. Living now in Rome, helped by subscriptions from Benjamin Jowett and other English friends, she also started a free school for poor girls to propagate Mazzini's ideas on education. In this initiative she was assisted by Ernesto, the only one of her nine sons to take Italian citizenship (in 1888) and who in 1907&#150;12 became a famous mayor of Rome. Another son, Joseph, after fighting as a volunteer in Garibaldi's army, collaborated actively with Josephine Butler in the campaigns against the state regulation of prostitution, a cause which his mother also supported.<br>
<br>Sarina Nathan died at 13 Portsdown Road, Kensington, London, on 19 February 1882, after surgery for what was probably cancer. Her express wish was that the funeral should be without religious ceremony, and she was buried in the campo Verano, near porta San Lorenzo, in Rome.<br>
