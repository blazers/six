<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walsh,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1618&#150;1688), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, also known as Petrus Valesius, was born at Mooretown, co. Kildare, Ireland. His father was a chandler in Naas, and his mother, whose maiden name was Goodie, was alleged to have been an English protestant.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Walsh, like many sons of the Old English Catholic gentry, was educated in Europe. About 1630 he joined the Franciscan college of St Anthony, Louvain, founded by Florence Conry in 1606. He excelled in his studies, and became a member of the order and a doctor, and later professor of divinity. His doctoral thesis was dedicated to his friend and mentor Cornelius Jansen, then bishop-elect of Ypres. Although Walsh did not share Jansen's doctrine of grace on the controversial contemporary issue of papal supremacy, his views were certainly Jansenist and Gallican. The struggle for supremacy between spiritual and temporal authority, papal and monarchical power, divided Catholic Europe at this time and would be manifested in Ireland in these decades with decisive results. It was Walsh's stance on this crucial issue, together with his future association with James Butler, first duke of Ormond, which would fundamentally affect the rest of his life and determine his place in Irish history.<h2>
<a name="WalshinIreland16461652"></a>Walsh in Ireland, 1646&#150;1652</h2>Walsh returned to Ireland in 1646, at the height of the confederate war, to Kilkenny, headquarters of the Catholic confederacy. He joined the Franciscan house, and was appointed public lecturer in divinity and later chaplain to the army in Munster. He was immediately embroiled in the political controversy surrounding the peace treaty proclaimed on 30 July 1646 and agreed between the confederate supreme council and Ormond, the king's representative. The majority of the council and the Old English Catholic nobility supported the treaty, but most of the clergy, under the authority of the papal nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo, rejected its terms. Rinuccini argued that the Catholic majority in Ireland should not compromise with a heretic protestant king whose current crisis presented the opportunity to insist upon the establishment of the Catholic church in Ireland. At a meeting of the clergy in Waterford, Walsh was among a minority who opposed the nuncio and the so-called unanimous decree of 12 August which declared perjured any Catholics who adhered to the peace treaty, said to have violated the previous oath of association. Walsh's defiance of the nuncio and the principle of papal supremacy in Ireland resulted in his excommunication on 1 September. Rinuccini blamed him for misleading the nobility with his heretical ideas.<br>
<br>With the supreme council in prison and Rinuccini apparently dominant, Walsh continued the verbal offensive. In 1647, in nine successive sermons in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, he preached against the teaching of Cornelius Mahony, a Jesuit from Cork then living in Lisbon. In 1645 Mahony had published <span class="italic">Disputatio apologetica</span>, which argued that the English crown had forfeited the right to govern Ireland, having broken the terms of Pope Adrian's grant. Walsh was subsequently deprived of his house and appointment at Kilkenny and forbidden access to a library. However, with the support of David Rothe, bishop of Ossory, and most of the supreme council, he continued to speak out against Rinuccini's stance. Walsh argued that loyalty to a protestant king was not only consistent with Catholic faith and moral duty but also the best option for the future of the Catholic church in Ireland.<br>
<br>A cessation of arms agreed between the supreme council and Inchiquin on 20 May 1648 was also condemned by Rinuccini, who proclaimed all its adherents excommunicated. The guardian of the Franciscans, Paul King, who enforced the nuncio's censure, was arrested by the council and replaced by Walsh. The council, with Walsh's assistance and the support of fourteen prelates, appealed directly to Rome against the censure. Despite the agency of Luke Wadding, another product of Louvain, the pope rejected their appeal, and unconditional absolution was only officially granted in 1688. Walsh was charged by Rothe and the supporting clergy with drafting a defence of their position. In 1648, with Owen Roe O'Neill, a supporter of Rinuccini, and the Ulster army encamped around Kilkenny, Walsh took three days and nights to write <span class="italic">Queries Concerning the Lawfulness of the Present Cessation</span>, his first publication. Thomas Dease, bishop of Meath, gave the paper his approval, and no one at the time attempted a response. Although Dease was the only bishop to support Walsh, he had significant support among the Old English Jesuits, lawyers, and gentry.<br>
<br>Walsh's articulate opposition to Rinuccini brought him to the attention of Ormond, whom he met in Kilkenny for the first time in September 1648. Walsh's background and education, together with the support of many of Ormond's Old English friends and relatives, would also have recommended him. The conclusion of the second peace treaty between Ormond and the confederate council, approved by nine bishops on 17 January 1649, signalled the defeat of the nuncio and his departure from Ireland. Rinuccini's supporters were not all from a Gaelic Irish background, but the vast majority of Walsh's clerical support would have been considered Old English. It was the clergy of &#145;English extraction&#146; who were later blamed for betraying the cause in Ireland in the 1640s (R. O'Ferrall and R. O'Connell, <span class="italic">Commentarius Rinuccinianus de sedis apostolicae legatione ad foederatos Hiberniae catholicos per annos 1645&#150;9</span>, ed. S. Kavanagh, 6 vols., 1932&#150;49, 4.212&#150;14).<br>
<br>In June 1649 Walsh was disciplined by Thomas McKiernan, provincial of the friars minor in Ireland, and sent to the convent at Castle Dermott &#145;for <i>domo diciplinae</i>, or prison&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.272), and there he remained until rescued by James Tuchet, earl of Castlehaven. Cromwell's victory at Kilkenny in March 1650 left Walsh without shelter and exposed to the persecution of his clerical opponents. Despite assistance from Castlehaven, who made Walsh his personal chaplain, conflict and opposition continued to plague him. The strength of feeling was such that Terence Albert O'Brien, bishop of Emly, threatened to undermine Castlehaven's forces at Limerick unless he abandoned Walsh. When the earl left for France in the autumn of 1651, Walsh was forced into hiding.<h2>
<a name="Yearsinexileandhiding16521660"></a>Years in exile and hiding, 1652&#150;1660</h2>In September 1652 Walsh was granted a passport by the parliamentary commissioners in Dublin, travelled to London, where he managed to remain until September 1654, and then went voluntarily to Madrid. On arrival in Spain he was imprisoned for several months before journeying to the Netherlands. Walsh suffered at this time from a lack of friends and supporters in the church, where the Roman hierarchy continued to censure him, and in Ireland, where his royalist connections to Ormond precluded favour. He was, however, able to live in hiding in England, only briefly venturing to Paris on one occasion. Apart from the Portuguese embassy in London, he received shelter in the homes of other Catholics or royalist associates of Ormond, with whom he maintained contact. In April 1660 he corresponded, in cipher, with the earl under the alias of Mr Weston, and was able to report positive developments in London preceding the king's restoration  (MS Carte 214, fols. 71, 147).<h2>
<a name="Restoration"></a>Restoration</h2>After the restoration of Charles II in May 1660 there were few Irish Catholic clerics better placed than Walsh or with greater potential to influence Irish politics. He was resident in London and had maintained contact with Ormond, one of the king's closest advisers. In the declaration of Breda, 4 April 1660, the basis for restoration, Charles had promised liberty of conscience, and Walsh must have been hopeful for the future. Like Sir Nicholas Plunkett and other agents for the Irish Catholic laity, he expected the terms of the peace treaty of 1649 to be honoured in respect of those that had, at great personal cost, remained loyal to the king in Ireland and served him in exile. In August, however, despite the king's personal plea, Irish Catholics were excluded from general pardon in the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> passed by the English parliament. By October 1660 Walsh expressed his concerns in a letter to Ormond &#145;desiring a just and merciful regard of the Roman Catholics of Ireland&#146;  (Walsh to Ormond, Oct 1660, MS Carte 59, fols. 421&#150;87). He urged Ormond to allay the fears and criticisms of even his &#145;fastest friends&#146;  (ibid., fol. 487) by acting promptly to ensure justice for the innocent and mercy for the guilty who had already suffered significantly for their crimes. The letter, later published, provoked a response from Roger Boyle, earl of Orrery. In <span class="italic">Irish Colours Displayed</span> Boyle highlighted Catholic treachery in 1641. In his response, <span class="italic">Irish Colours Folded</span> (1662), Walsh stated that casualty figures in the war were greatly exaggerated, and any atrocities were committed by the &#145;rascal multitude&#146;.<br>
<br>The king's declaration for the settlement of Ireland, issued on 30 November 1660, reflected Orrery's views and confirmed Walsh's fears. The Cromwellian settlement of former Catholic lands would be maintained except where the old proprietors could prove their &#145;innocence&#146; in respect of events from 1641. It was apparent to Walsh that the recent past remained a stumbling block for future favour. Ormond had not forgotten what he considered the treachery of the Catholic prelates. Walsh therefore urged the church hierarchy to make a positive representation to the king so that their silence could not be misinterpreted as dissension.<br>
<br>At the Restoration there were only three Catholic bishops in Ireland. Eugene Sweeney, bishop of Kilmore (1630&#150;69), who was bedridden; the Franciscan Anthony MacGeoghegan, bishop of Clonmacnoise (1648&#150;57) and Meath (1657&#150;61), a fierce opponent of Walsh; and the primate, Edmund O'Reilly, archbishop of Armagh (1658&#150;69). Given Walsh's position and the political context, and despite previous conflict, O'Reilly had little option but to appoint him as agent for the Catholic clergy at Whitehall. A procuration or power of attorney, dated 1 January 1661, was forwarded to Walsh by Anthony Gearnon, the queen mother's chaplain, and signed by the available members of the hierarchy including Patrick Plunkett, bishop of Dromore and Ardagh, and, by proxy, Nicholas French, bishop of Ferns. Walsh was delegated to &#145;obtain what favours his Majesty should think fit by connivance or otherwise, for the exercise of their religion, and to save them from persecution&#146;  (Walsh, <span class="italic">History</span>, 4&#150;5). He was &#145;soundly checked&#146; by Ormond for receiving such a document from those previously &#145;very obnoxious to the laws and disaffected&#146; to the king's interest  (ibid., 6), but despite initial hostility Walsh did receive his assistance in securing the release of 120 priests from prison without distinction or qualification.<br>
<br>Fear and uncertainty mounted in Ireland throughout 1661. The king's declaration proved practically unworkable and, as Patrick Darcy argued, legally deficient as a basis for the settlement of Ireland. The Irish parliament, convened on 8 May 1661, with an entirely protestant House of Commons, only served to heighten political tensions. Stories of the alleged activities of Jesuits and rumours of priests collecting funds for another rebellion were widespread. The king's response to the crisis only served to enhance Walsh's political influence. On 4 November he announced that Ormond would return to Ireland as viceroy; Walsh's experience and influence were now indispensable.<br>
<br>Although Walsh did not draft the Catholic remonstrance of December 1661, its author, Richard Bellings, was familiar enough with Ormond and the political context to recognize the need to offer reassurance regarding the allegiance of the Irish clergy. They were not only the focus of protestant fears but also Ormond's resentment, and Walsh was convinced that the laity would suffer in the forthcoming <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> as a result. The remonstrance or loyal formulary was drafted at a small gathering in Dublin. The document was sent to England and given to Walsh by Luke Plunkett, third earl of Fingall, with the request that Ormond present it to the king. The duke dismissed the remonstrance as only a useful paper without signatures, but Walsh, acting as agent, defended their actions and pointed out that a large gathering of Catholics in Dublin at that time would have been impossible. He subsequently called together the Irish Catholic clergy then in London, and on 11 and 15 January 1662 Oliver Darcy, bishop of Dromore, and thirty other Catholic clerics met to discuss subscription. Twenty-four of their number signed the document, which was, with Ormond's approval, presented to the king on 3 February and was well received. At the time Walsh accepted plausible excuses from those who failed to subscribe, but their outright opposition later became apparent. Ninety-eight members of the Irish nobility and gentry in London signed their own copy of the remonstrance, which was an unequivocal declaration of allegiance to the king regardless of any other power or opinion either princely or papal.<br>
<br>Three weeks after the remonstrance was accepted by the king, Walsh again expressed his fears to Ormond about the Irish settlement. The two men had clearly exchanged views on the subject. Walsh admitted that his conscience was troubled ever since because he had remained silent regarding what he believed to be the &#145;great inequality in the intended distribution of justice&#146;  (Walsh to Ormond, 24 Feb [1662], MS Carte 45, fols. 274&#150;5) to Irish Catholics. He informed Ormond that he was morally bound to honour the peace treaty of 1649 and warned of the judgment of God on both himself and the king if they neglected their obligation.<h2>
<a name="WalshinIreland16621669"></a>Walsh in Ireland, 1662&#150;1669</h2>In an effort to explain and promote the remonstrance, Walsh published a &#145;little book&#146; in 1662 entitled <span class="italic">A More Ample Account</span>, but this only seemed to galvanize opposition. By the time he reached Ireland that summer, despite the additional signatures of forty-five clerics and thirty-two members of the laity, opponents of the remonstrance were dominant, particularly among the church hierarchy. With the benefit of Ormond's patronage Walsh evidently lived quite comfortably in Kennedy's Court, near Christ Church, but by the end of that year Sir Nicholas Plunkett observed that the oath had actually added to the troubles facing the Catholic interest. They now faced not only their enemies within the protestant interest but also the united opposition of the Catholic church both at home and abroad (MS Carte 32, fol. 146).<br>
<br>The oath was condemned by Walsh's own faculty at Louvain, the Brussels internuncio de Vechiis, and Cardinal Francesco Barberini in Rome. Walsh's aim had been to acknowledge and draw a line under the mistakes of the past and begin to build trust and confidence, which he believed would lead to liberty for their religion in the future. However, the division created by the oath had the opposite effect and suggested that nothing had changed in Ireland since the 1640s. Given the European controversy on this very issue, Walsh must surely have anticipated this outcome. Political and religious tensions in Ireland were such that by 1663 the king's earlier private instructions to Ormond to promote the remonstrance were rescinded. Promotion of the oath thereafter was almost negligible, and by 1665 of approximately 2000 Catholic clerics in Ireland (1200 secular, 800 regular) only 69 were remonstrants  (Brenan, 481). Walsh later stated that 70 clerics and 124 members of the laity had subscribed  (P. Walsh, <span class="italic">Four Letters</span>, 1686, 3).<br>
<br>Walsh, like Ormond, refused to countenance other versions of the oath offered by Jesuits, Dominicans, and Franciscans, and argued that their refusal to subscribe to the 1661 remonstrance was in itself conclusive. He recalled a secret meeting in September 1664, in the backyard of Somerset House, with Peter Talbot, later archbishop of Dublin, Patrick Maginn, Redmond Caron, and the Brussels internuncio de Vechiis, who had come to England incognito. An alternate oath suggested by Talbot was dismissed by Walsh at the time and later by Ormond  (Walsh, <span class="italic">History</span>, 511&#150;12).<br>
<br>In 1666, described by Walsh as a &#145;wonderful year&#146;  (Walsh, <span class="italic">History</span>, 664), he convinced Ormond to allow a national synod of the Catholic church because he apparently still believed that the prelates could be persuaded by debate and by observing the desperate plight of the Irish Catholic people. The theological faculty of the Sorbonne, Paris, had produced six propositions in 1663 which affirmed the supremacy of the king, and Walsh may have thought that this development would add weight to his argument. The synod met for fifteen days from 11 June in the parish house of St Audoen's, Dublin. Primate O'Reilly brought with him letters of condemnation from Giacomo Rospigliosi, Brussels internuncio, against the remonstrance and the meeting itself. The oath and the Sorbonne propositions, which denied papal supremacy, were rejected, and an alternative declaration of loyalty to the king, which they produced, proved unacceptable to Ormond. The clergy refused to acknowledge any guilt or responsibility for the events of the 1640s. Nicholas French later told Walsh that his assertion that the hostilities in the 1640s had been a &#145;rebellion&#146; rather than a &#145;just war&#146; had offended him more than the remonstrance itself  (Walsh, <span class="italic">Four Letters</span>, 32). Walsh's opponents alleged that the synod, like the oath, was used by Ormond not only to cause division but also to justify the iniquitous settlement of Ireland by suggesting that little had changed since 1641.<br>
<br>Walsh enjoyed a degree of influence in Ireland while Ormond remained in the viceroyalty, but this may well have been the case without the remonstrance. For Walsh and his supporters a fundamental problem remained. The oath, despite its unprecedented declaration of allegiance and the support of Louis XIV and the Gallican church, had secured no tangible benefits for its adherents. The whole affair proved irrelevant to the Restoration land settlement in Ireland, and, contrary to Walsh's request, existing royal chaplains and new appointees were not required to subscribe. Ormond himself had recommended Patrick Maginn (a non-subscriber) for promotion at court to the post of grand almoner to the queen  (Ormond to the king, 9 Dec 1665, MS Carte 219, fol. 58). Father Thomas Talbot, brother of Peter and Richard, complained to Walsh that unless the world changed the remonstrance would prove useless  (Talbot to Walsh, 19 May 1662, MS Carte 31, fols. 373&#150;4). By the time Ormond was removed from the lieutenancy on 24 February 1669 Walsh had failed to achieve his objectives, and the few remaining remonstrant clergy in Ireland were left at a considerable disadvantage.<h2>
<a name="Yearsinopposition16691673"></a>Years in opposition, 1669&#150;1673</h2>The Roman authorities were determined to retain control of the church in Ireland, and Walsh observed that while Rome governed appointments to the Irish hierarchy they held real power in the country. Walsh was informed in 1669 that the papal internuncio was not interested in doctrine or debate but in obedience. Opposition to Walsh and the remonstrance had become a prerequisite for high office in the Irish Catholic church at this time. In 1669 the newly appointed archbishops of Armagh and Dublin, Oliver Plunkett and Peter Talbot respectively, were avowed enemies of Walsh. Plunkett, a stout proponent of papal authority, described him as &#145;a lost soul, another Luther&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Saint Oliver Plunkett</span>, 42). Talbot, a sworn enemy of Ormond and Walsh, referred to the latter as &#145;that wrangling friar&#146;  (Talbot's vindication from Walsh's opinion, MS Carte 45, fol. 283). He branded him &#145;Peter pence&#146;  (ibid., fol. 287) and made much of the fact that Walsh had received &pound;300 per year from Ormond throughout these years. Walsh also had &pound;100 per year for the seneschalship of Winchester from 1667, with Bishop Morley's approval  (Burke, 12).<br>
<br>Archbishop Talbot in particular relentlessly pursued the remonstrant clergy in a determined effort to force them to recant. Walsh, who was resident in England during the period of the cabal and the secret treaty of Dover, endeavoured to highlight their plight by petitioning the king, Ormond, and Lord Berkeley, the Irish lord lieutenant, on their behalf. Berkeley, however, had little time for Ormond and grew to hate Walsh because of his repeated references to his patron's superior government of Ireland. The remonstrant clergy therefore found themselves isolated, with Walsh or Ormond virtually powerless to influence events. Walsh himself was excommunicated for the second time on 24 May 1670 by the chapter-general of the Franciscans at Valladolid for publishing material without official sanction&#151;insubordination rather than heresy. In a petition to the king, Thomas Harold referred to the &#145;daring prosecution&#146; of Walsh in London in 1669, 1670, and 1671 by the church court  (petition of Thomas Harold to the king, MS Carte 45, fols. 244&#150;8). Walsh, however, continued to publish material to support his arguments and defend his actions. In 1672 his <span class="italic">Epistola prima ad Thomam Haroldum</span>, was printed (Harold was a remonstrant and a prisoner in Brussels) and in 1673 a series of twelve letters purportedly between a Catholic and protestant gentleman, <span class="italic">The controversial letters, or, Grand controversy concerning the temporal authority of the popes over the whole earth, &amp;c.</span>, was published.<h2>
<a name="Reactionandresurgence16731677"></a>Reaction and resurgence, 1673&#150;1677</h2>It was not the new administration of Arthur Capel, earl of Essex and Irish lord lieutenant (1672&#150;7), which produced a political change but the address of the English House of Commons to the king in March 1673. Charles II was forced to cancel the second declaration of indulgence and curtail the activities in Ireland of Peter Talbot in particular, something that Walsh had been requesting for years. Essex was certainly more willing to receive petitions from Walsh and advice from Ormond regarding the Catholic clergy. However, as Walsh reflected on events since 1660 he was clearly entertaining doubts, not least about Ormond's motives in the whole remonstrance affair. In a letter to his patron he suggested that the opposition and persecution might have been prevented if his advice had been followed regarding the subscription of royal chaplains and Ormond had not stopped a circular letter from the Catholic nobility in 1663. He added that Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, should have published the remonstrance rather than returning it to the clergy. Walsh was also deeply troubled by stories that Ormond had deliberately divided the Catholic clergy and, in fact, used him to that purpose. He concluded by saying that he would no longer be surprised by anything because, since the restoration, he had seen so many &#145;strange things done, quite contrary&#146; to equity and policy and, &#145;which is worst of all, to honesty and justice&#146;  ([Walsh to Ormond], 30 July [1673], MS Carte 45, fols. 407&#150;12). By 1674 Walsh blamed himself for opening a &#145;spring&#146; which turned into a &#145;bitter fountain&#146;  (Walsh to Essex, 4 Aug 1674, MS Carte 45, fols. 252&#150;5).<br>
<br>Walsh's major work, <span class="italic">The History and Vindication of the Loyal Formulary, or Irish Remonstrance</span>, was published in 1674. His <span class="italic">Letter to the Catholics of England, Ireland and Scotland, &amp;c.</span>, written in 1673 and printed earlier in 1674, constituted the preface. The book, a significant account of Irish Catholic political and religious history since the 1640s, contains copies of many important contemporary documents. Walsh draws on European and Irish church history, secular history, theology, law, and philosophy to explain and defend the remonstrance. His arguments were not only Gallican but also logical and pragmatic within the Irish context, and he was convinced that they did not contradict Catholic faith and teaching. Walsh believed that, apart from addressing the practical difficulties facing Catholics in Ireland, the oath would lay a foundation of trust which could bring about a reunion of the churches of England and Rome. However, with the benefit of hindsight, Walsh was ironically philosophical regarding the whole affair. Acknowledging the failure of the remonstrance Walsh encouraged his readers to take the &#145;comfort of a good conscience&#146; before any earthly gain, and look for a reward in a &#145;better place&#146;  (Walsh, <span class="italic">History</span>, 37).<h2>
<a name="OrmondsviceroyaltyandWalshslateryears16771688"></a>Ormond's viceroyalty and Walsh's later years, 1677&#150;1688</h2>Throughout the remainder of the 1670s Walsh enjoyed the patronage and protection of Ormond, particularly after the duke's return to the lord lieutenancy of Ireland in 1677. Walsh was again in a position to solicit favour for his family in Ireland, albeit discreetly. Any toleration of Catholicism, however, proved difficult after 1673, but during the alleged Popish Plot and exclusion crisis it was almost impossible, and certainly politically too dangerous.<br>
<br>In 1682, on the advice of Castlehaven, Walsh published the first part of <span class="italic">A Prospect of the State of Ireland from 1556&#150;1652</span>, a rather poor historical account. His <span class="italic">Causa Valesiana</span>, written in Latin in his usual verbose style, was published in 1684. Addressed to a wider European audience, it again defended his stance and that of Caron against the church hierarchy. The details included in this work, however, caused great offence among some of Walsh's most valuable friends. The bishop of Winchester was alarmed that Walsh had publicly acknowledged his part in ensuring his payment for the seneschalship of Winchester. Morley resolved never again to communicate with Walsh  (Walsh to Ormond, 21 Sept 1684, <span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 7.273). Ormond was also offended by Walsh's reference to a conversation in 1661 with an unnamed &#145;illustrious person&#146; who informed him of an intention to repeal the penal laws against Catholics. The duke was most concerned that either Clarendon or himself were implicated, and Walsh was equally anxious to publish a denial  (Walsh to Ormond, 10 Jan 1685, <span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 306&#150;9).<br>
<br>On the succession of James II in February 1685 the remonstrance controversy and the whole issue of oaths of allegiance was revived. The new king had not required the oaths of supremacy or allegiance from his army officers in Ireland, but was content with a simple promise of fidelity. Walsh's opponents saw this as proof that the English authorities had never demanded the remonstrance in the first place. In 1686 Walsh published his <span class="italic">Four Letters on Several Subjects to Persons of Quality</span>, who included the earl of Essex and Nicholas French, bishop of Ferns. The correspondence between Walsh and French was mostly a retrospective discussion of controversial events in Ireland and Ormond's actions regarding the Catholic interest.<br>
<br>In almost forty years of association with Ormond, Walsh had never spoken of religion until 1686. He informed the duke that while the Catholic church had many faults it was still the &#145;mother&#146; and the &#145;safest for salvation to die therein&#146;. Ormond replied that he could not embrace what he condemned and wondered why, if he stood in such eternal danger, Walsh had not spoken to his &#145;good friend&#146; sooner  (MS Carte 69, fol. 78). In a letter to Sir Robert Southwell in 1687, who was himself writing a history of these years, Walsh indicated his agreement that there had been as much rebellion in the oath of association as in the covenant. He declared, however, that religion had not been the true cause of the 1641 rebellion but &#145;liberty and property and the shaking off of the English yoke&#146;. He had actually substituted the word &#145;liberty&#146; for &#145;religion&#146; in Castlehaven's history of the time  (Walsh to Southwell, 19 March 1687, MS Carte 70, fol. 564).<br>
<br>On 13 March 1688, just before his death, Walsh agreed and signed a retraction of the remonstrance and submitted his &#145;private judgement to that of the church&#146;  (Brenan, 486). The declaration was witnessed by Genetti, the nuncio Adda's chaplain, and three Irish Franciscans, including John Everard, himself a subscriber to the remonstrance. On the same day he dictated a final letter to Ormond which contained two last requests. Walsh asked that the Franciscans be given the convent in Kilkenny which they had formerly occupied, and that Ormond would help his nephew Andrew Laborne, who had eleven children and little support  (Walsh to Ormond, 13 March 1688, MS Carte 118, fol. 357). Walsh died two days later on 15 March having received absolution from Genetti. He was later buried in London, in St Dunstan-in-the-West.<br>
<br>Contemporary comment on Walsh's life and historical contribution has depended not only on the author's relationship to Walsh but also to Ormond, his patron. Rinuccini described Walsh as a &#145;sacrilegious profaner&#146; who &#145;vomited forth in one hour more filth (<i>sordes</i>) and blasphemy than Luther and Calvin together in three years&#146;  (Moran, 3.72). The writer of the <span class="italic">Aphorismical Discovery</span> branded him a &#145;protestant English slut's son&#146;, a &#145;Judas&#146;, a &#145;Lutheran dogmatist&#146;, and a &#145;hireling wolf in sheep's clothing&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.238, 273&#150;6), among other things. Even his friend Castlehaven referred to him as the &#145;earl's [Ormond's] ghostly father&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Castlehaven</span>, 117). Burnet, however, described him as the &#145;honestest and learnedest&#146; member of the Catholic clergy he had ever met  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.355). There is no doubt that Walsh enjoyed the mutual respect of several members of the Anglican hierarchy, such as Archbishop Dolben of York and Bishop Barlow of Winchester. He was also, surprisingly, on friendly terms with Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey. In terms of Irish nationalist historiography, Walsh has been tried and found guilty by association with Ormond, the &#145;unkind deserter of loyal men and true friends&#146; and the &#145;avowed&#146; enemy of Irish Catholics, according to Brenan  (Brenan, 478). Although dismissed as the &#145;giddy friar&#146; in the <span class="italic">Unkinde Deserter of Loyal Men and True Friends</span>, (Brussels; see Barnard and Fenlon, 181), his scholarship has been acknowledged by Corish, Millett, and Brenan. The latter described Walsh as &#145;naturally bold, impetuous and enterprising&#146;  (Brenan, 478), while Millett referred to him as a &#145;stormy petrel but a very able controversialist&#146;  (Millett, &#145;Irish literature in Latin&#146;, 578). Corish has also acknowledged him to be a &#145;man of some learning in canon law&#146;  (Corish, &#145;Ormond, Rinuccini and the confederates&#146;, 330).<br>
<br>There is little doubt that Walsh's views represented sincerely held convictions rather than political expedients, although he reminded readers of his history that while the poor Catholics of Ireland suffered for their principles the Roman hierarchy enjoyed the comfort of that &#145;city of fortune&#146;  (Walsh, <span class="italic">History</span>, 27&#150;8, 30). His attempt to address and resolve the problem of Irish Catholic civil allegiance and break the dominance of Rome over the Irish Catholic church was his most significant historical contribution. If he had succeeded, the consequences could have been far reaching not least for the Stuarts and the events which followed his death in 1688.<br>
