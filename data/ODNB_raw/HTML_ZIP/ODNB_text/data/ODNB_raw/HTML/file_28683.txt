<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ward,  Edward Matthew</span>  (1816&#150;1879), <span class="occ">historical genre painter</span>, was born on 14 July 1816 in Belgrave Place, Pimlico, London, the younger son of Charles James Ward (1781&#150;1858), an employee of Coutts's Bank in London, and his wife, Mary Ford, sister-in-law of the novelist Horace Smith. Ward won a silver medal from the Society of Arts in 1830 for a drawing, and he studied painting for a year in the studio of John Cawse in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. On the advice of Francis Chantrey and with the sponsorship of David Wilkie, he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1834. He had already exhibited that year at the Royal Academy a portrait of O. Smith in the role of Don Quixote. His painting <span class="italic">The Dead Ass</span>, from Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Sentimental Journey</span>, was accepted but not hung at the Royal Academy in 1835, and he left London in July 1836 to study in Rome. After visiting Paris and Venice, he stayed in Rome two and a half years, studying with Filippo Agricola at the Accademia di San Luca, and in 1838 won a silver medal for historical composition from the academy.<br>
<br>Ward returned to London in 1839 after learning fresco technique in Munich from Peter von Cornelius, a prominent Nazarene painter in Germany and Rome. That year he exhibited at the Royal Academy <span class="italic">Cimabue and Giotto</span>, which had been painted in Rome. In the 1840s he became a renowned painter of English and French history and the lives of writers. He exhibited in London every year from 1839 to 1877 and showed works at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855 and the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857. He was elected an ARA in 1846 and an RA in 1855. <span class="italic">Napoleon in the Prison of Nice</span>, exhibited at the British Institution in 1841 and bought by the duke of Wellington, is one of many scenes of prisons, trials, arrests, and executions produced throughout his career. His first such picture was <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Scene in the Prisoner's Lock of the Tribunal of Naples in 1838</span> (exh. RA, 1840). He also exhibited <span class="italic">Cornet Joyce Seizes the King at Holmby, 1647</span> (exh. 1841) and <span class="italic">The Disgrace of Lord Clarendon</span> (exh. 1846) at the Royal Academy, and established himself as a painter of seventeenth-century political history.<br>
<br>Ward also succeeded with eighteenth-century subjects such as <span class="italic">Dr Johnson Perusing the Manuscript of &#145;The Vicar of Wakefield&#146;</span> (exh. RA, 1843) and <span class="italic">Dr Johnson in Lord Chesterfield's Ante-Room in 1748</span> (exh. RA, 1845; Tate collection). These two paintings depict drawbacks of private patronage and the difficulty of making a living in the arts, themes which also appear in <span class="italic">The Early Life of Oliver Goldsmith</span> (exh. RA, 1844) and <span class="italic">Daniel Defoe with the Manuscript of &#145;Robinson Crusoe&#146;</span> (exh. RA, 1849). Such issues were widely discussed in the 1840s, especially in regard to painters, when the British government began to commission artists to decorate the new houses of parliament with frescos. Ward entered the first parliament fresco competition in 1843, but his cartoon of Boudicca did not win any prize. In 1851, nevertheless, he was commissioned to execute eight pictures in the corridor of the House of Commons: <span class="italic">The Execution of Montrose</span>, <span class="italic">The Last Sleep of Argyll</span>, <span class="italic">Alice Lisle Concealing Fugitives</span>, <span class="italic">Monk Declaring for a Free Parliament</span>, <span class="italic">The Escape of Charles II with Jane Lane</span>, <span class="italic">The Landing of Charles II</span>, <span class="italic">The Acquittal of the Seven Bishops</span>, and <span class="italic">William and Mary Receiving the Lords and Commons</span>. He visited Scotland in 1853 to gather material for <span class="italic">Montrose</span>, and completed and exhibited it at the Royal Academy that year; this and <span class="italic">Argyll</span>, which was completed and exhibited in 1854, were painted in oil. The lighting of the corridor made the canvases virtually impossible to see, and he was commissioned to repaint these first two subjects and execute the remaining subjects in fresco on framed sheets of slate, a task which was completed in the later 1860s. Ward painted oil replicas of the parliament frescoes and exhibited them individually at the Royal Academy over many years until 1875. The frescoes, like his oils, present a sweetened seventeenth-century style based on the popular art of David Wilkie; his smaller oils sometimes exhibit bolder brushwork and brighter colours. Despite his links to Cornelius, he did not embrace the medievalizing style of the German Nazarenes, who influenced other of the parliament artists; he remained a conservative figure, in contrast to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at mid-century.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1848 Ward married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45579/', "Henrietta Mary Ada Ward (1832&#150;1924)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28684/', "George Raphael Ward")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28686/', "Ward, James (1769&#150;1859)")</script>] and Mary Webb Ward. She was the granddaughter of the artist James Ward and became herself a noted painter, producing&#151;within a narrower range&#151;many works similar to those of her husband. She and Ward had eight children: Alice, Leslie, Eva, Flora, Wriothesley, Beatrice, Enid, and Stanhope. By 1852 the family had settled at 11 Upton Park Villas, Slough, and then at 3 Queens Villas, Windsor. For several years Ward also retained a studio in London at 1 Kent Villas, Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill.<br>
<br>Ward's successes in the 1850s included <span class="italic">James II Receiving News of the Landing of the Prince of Orange</span> (exh. RA, 1850; Tate collection) and <span class="italic">The Royal Family of France in the Prison of the Temple</span> (exh. RA, 1851; Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston). Queen Victoria commissioned him to paint <span class="italic">Napoleon III Receiving the Order of the Garter</span> and <span class="italic">The Visit of Queen Victoria to the Tomb of Napoleon</span> (both exh. RA, 1858; Royal Collection). He also produced literary paintings: <span class="italic">Byron's Early Love: a Dream of Annesley Hall</span> (exh. RA, 1856; Manchester City Galleries) and <span class="italic">John Gilpin Delayed by his Customers</span> (exh. RA, 1851).<br>
<br>Ward's style and subjects remained largely unchanged in the 1860s and 1870s. He painted <span class="italic">The Death of Charles II</span> (exh. RA, 1861), <span class="italic">Hogarth in his Studio</span> (exh. RA, 1863; York City Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Amy Robsart and Leicester</span> (exh. RA, 1866), <span class="italic">The Eve of St Bartholomew</span> (exh. RA, 1873), and <span class="italic">William III at Windsor</span> (exh. RA, 1877), and numerous canvases memorializing Marie Antoinette and other figures of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>. About 1875, however, he visited Brittany and Normandy and enlarged his range by painting French street scenes and a modern historical genre painting, <span class="italic">A Year after the Battle: the Memento Scene at Dinan</span> (exh. RA, 1876; Forbes Magazine collection, New York).<br>
<br>Ward was a large man, with black hair, reportedly rough in manner and appearance. On 10 January 1879 he was found raving on the floor of his dressing-room, his throat cut with a razor; he was shouting, &#145;I was mad when I did it; the devil prompted me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Jan 1879, 11). Medical help arrived, but he died on 15 January at his home, 3 Queens Villas, in Windsor. The inquest in Windsor on 17 January found that he committed suicide while temporarily insane. Ward was buried at Upton Old Church on 21 January and the contents of his studio were sold at Christies, London, on 29 March. Of his children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36735/', "Leslie Ward (1851&#150;1922)")</script> was Spy, the caricaturist for <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, and Eva and Flora were miniature painters.<br>
