<span class="headword">Vulliamy,  Lewis</span>  (1791&#150;1871), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 15 March 1791 at 68 Pall Mall, London, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50603/', "Benjamin Vulliamy (1747&#150;1811)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50605/', "Vulliamy family")</script>], clockmaker, and Sarah de Gingins (1758&#150;1841); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28357/', "Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy (1780&#150;1854)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50605/', "Vulliamy family")</script>] was his eldest brother. Articled at the age of sixteen to Robert Smirke, Vulliamy entered the Royal Academy Schools in March 1809 and won the silver medal in 1810 and the gold medal in 1813 with a design for a nobleman's country mansion. On leaving Smirke's office in 1814 he commenced his own practice: one of his first commissions, obtained in 1815 through a family recommendation, was to oversee the repair and enlargement of Syston Park in Lincolnshire for Sir John Heyford Thorold, bt. Vulliamy was to add a notable library wing there in 1822&#150;4. In 1818 he was awarded the Royal Academy's travelling studentship, which enabled him to spend four years on the continent, chiefly in Italy, although he also ventured as far as Greece and Asia Minor. His study of classical and Renaissance buildings, together with an equal familiarity with English domestic architecture, formed a firm foundation for his subsequent career as a country house architect.<br>
<br>On his return to England Vulliamy established himself in London at 361 Oxford Street and in 1822 submitted as his first entry to the Royal Academy a &#145;design for the court of a palace&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">RA exhibitors</span>, 8.94). His commissions were initially rather more humble, and included speculative housing in Tavistock Square and Gordon (later Endsleigh) Place in Bloomsbury in 1827. Vulliamy's very considerable output was itemized in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> in 1871, an account which was based on a list drawn up by the architect himself. He established a reputation for his Gothic churches, such as St Bartholomew's, Sydenham (1826&#150;31), St Barnabas's, Addison Road, Kensington (1828&#150;9), St Michael's, Highgate (1830&#150;32; design exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1831), and Christ Church, Woburn Square (1831&#150;3; design exhibited at the Royal Academy, 1833; dem.). Other churches built by Vulliamy were: at Wardle, Worsthorne, at Burnley (Holy Trinity, Accrington Lane), and at Habergam Eaves, all in Lancashire; St Paul's, Burslem, and Christ Church, Cobridge, in Staffordshire; Christ Church, Todmorden, Yorkshire; and in Dorset, Norfolk, and elsewhere. He was also responsible for works at Rochester Cathedral in the mid-1840s. Vulliamy's non-Gothic churches included the Norman Glasbury church in Brecknockshire (1836&#150;7), and the Italianate All Saints', Ennismore Gardens, Westminster (1848&#150;9).<br>
<br>Vulliamy was also responsible for a number of diverse public buildings across the country, including a grandstand at Wolverhampton racecourse (1828), the Epping union workhouse (1837), and the Lock Hospital, Paddington (1842&#150;9). His most prestigious London commissions were the Law Society's premises in Chancery Lane (1828&#150;32), with later additions; designs exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830 and 1832; and the re-fronting of the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street in 1838, to which he added a screen of giant Corinthian half-columns (designs exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1837 and 1838). On 16 January 1838 Vulliamy married Elizabeth Anne, only child of Frederick Papendiek, vicar of Morden, Surrey; they had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Vulliamy is best remembered for his domestic work. A number of Lincolnshire commissions followed on from his work at Syston Park, including Boothby Pagnell Hall (1825), and he was soon engaged across the country carrying out alterations to gentlemen's seats, besides designing numerous rectories. Vulliamy's mastery of classical, Gothic, Renaissance, and Tudor idioms enabled him to respond to the period's eclectic requirements. His most important patron was the multi-millionaire Robert Stayner Holford, who in 1839 engaged Vulliamy to carry out work at his Gloucestershire seat at Westonbirt. Having commenced with alterations to the extant house he was subsequently commissioned to design a totally new house in an opulent English Renaissance idiom; this was commenced in 1864 and was unfinished at Vulliamy's death. Westonbirt was one of Vulliamy's two most important works. The other was Holford's London residence: Dorchester House, on Park Lane. This replaced John Vardy's house of the 1750s and was completed in 1857. It was a massive palazzo based on Peruzzi's Villa Farnesina, with a magnificent staircase and sumptuous internal decoration by Alfred Stevens. Until it was demolished in 1929 to make way for the eponymous hotel, Dorchester House was one of the grandest residences of Victorian London.<br>
<br>Vulliamy's extremely successful career was &#145;due equally to his ability and his industry &hellip; He was well known to be peculiar in his notions, and many odd anecdotes are related of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 142). His best-known pupil was Owen Jones; his nephew George Vulliamy assisted him on Dorchester House. Never regarded among the first rank of architects, he was, with Charles Barry, one of the outstanding practitioners of the Italianate style in early Victorian England. Vulliamy published two works: <span class="italic">The Bridge of the SSa. Trinita, over the Arno at Florence</span> (1822) and <span class="italic">Examples of ornamental sculpture in architecture, drawn from the originals in Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy in the years 1818, 1819, 1820, 1821</span> (1823). His drawings of the castle at Newcastle were published in <span class="italic">Vetusta monumenta</span> vol. 5 (1835) as plates 10&#150;18. He died at his house on Clapham Common on 4 January 1871: despite having suffered from chronic bronchitis for several years, he worked until the end. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He left an estate valued at about &pound;60,000.<br>
