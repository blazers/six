<span class="headword">Cope, Sir  John <span class="st"> [Jonathan]</span></span>  (1690&#150;1760), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Cope (<i>b</i>. 1645), of Icomb, Gloucestershire, a retired army officer, and Dorothy Waller, the widow of an excise man. John (or Jonathan) Cope was disinherited owing to the disapproval of his grandfather William Cope of Henry Cope's choice of wife; after attending Westminster School he was therefore obliged to make his own way in the world. Cope responded to this challenge with spectacular success. In 1706, during the War of the Spanish Succession, he was appointed page to Thomas Wentworth, third Baron Raby, Queen Anne's ambassador at Berlin. Raby was colonel of the Royal regiment of dragoons, in which he obtained Cope a cornet's commission on 14 March 1707. Upon joining his regiment in Spain, Cope made a favourable impression and in June 1708 was invited to serve as aide-de-camp to Major-General James Stanhope, the commander-in-chief. Stanhope's patronage ensured that Cope thereafter enjoyed accelerated promotion. In October 1710 Cope secured a captaincy in the 3rd foot guards&#151;an appointment that carried the army rank of lieutenant-colonel. By the war's close in 1713 Cope was brevet colonel of Wynne's foot, outranking many officers with longer service.<br>
<br>On 16 December 1712, at St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, London, Cope cemented his social position by marrying Jane Duncombe, sister of Anthony Duncombe, later first Baron Feversham, and niece of the former lord mayor of London Sir Charles Duncombe. In 1722 Cope entered parliament as MP for Queenborough. He later represented Liskeard (1727&#150;34) and Orford (1738&#150;41), voting consistently in support of Walpole's administration. He may have been the John Cope who married Elizabeth Waple at St Anne and St Agnes on 31 August 1736; if so, his first wife was dead by this date.<br>
<br>During these years of peace Cope's army career continued to prosper. In June 1737 he secured the colonelcy of the regiment that subsequently became the 9th dragoons; he was colonel of the 7th dragoons from 1741 until his death. He was promoted to brigadier-general in 1735; appointment to major-general followed four years later. By 1743, after Britain intervened in the War of the Austrian Succession, Cope ranked as lieutenant-general. Despite his enduring reputation as a cowardly incompetent, described by one critic as &#145;a little, dressy, finical man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 179), Cope played a creditable role in the ensuing German campaign. That June he prevented the capture of the British contingent's commander, John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair, after his escort was surprised by enemy hussars. Cope's gallant conduct was noted by James Wolfe, the future conqueror of Quebec, in a letter to his father of 21 June 1743. Cope participated in the defeat of the French at Dettingen, and in the subsequent mood of euphoria was created a knight of the Bath.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of the 1745 rising, Cope commanded in Scotland. Although his regular troops were scarce and of poor quality, he was persuaded to advance into the highlands and confront Charles Edward Stuart without delay. Having concentrated his forces at Stirling, he marched for Fort Augustus. On hearing that the Jacobites intended to defend the perilous Corrieyairack Pass, on 26 August Cope called a council of war and accepted its recommendation to head for Inverness instead. Though understandable, Cope's decision was heavily criticized as it allowed the Jacobites to capture Edinburgh. It was reported that this &#145;false step&#146; led the delighted Young Pretender to drink Cope's health and exclaim: &#145;if all the Usurper's Generals follow his Example, I shall soon be at St. James's&#146;  (Henderson, 34&#150;5). Naval transports rendezvoused with Cope's troops at Aberdeen and ferried them down the coast to Dunbar. His force disembarked on 18 September, and on the following day marched towards Edinburgh. The Jacobite army advanced to meet him.<br>
<br>On 20 September the two armies made contact near Prestonpans, where Cope arrayed his troops in a strong defensive position. That night a local Jacobite sympathizer indicated a route by which Cope's flank could be turned. The Jacobite approach was detected by Cope's outposts, so allowing time to organize a line of battle. However, when the highlanders launched their broadsword charge at daybreak on 21 September, Cope's redcoats bolted with scarcely a show of resistance. Cope struggled to rally them, exclaiming &#145;For Shame, Gentlemen; don't let us be beat by such a set of Banditti&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of the Proceedings</span>, 61). Collecting 450 dragoons, Cope retreated to Berwick. News of Prestonpans caused consternation in London and Cope became the scapegoat for the government's dismal showing during the opening phase of the 'Forty-Five. The public clamour against him was so great that, when a court of inquiry was held in September 1746, it was predicted that he would &#145;meet with the justice he deserved&#146;  (ibid., iv). However, after examining more than forty witnesses, the generals composing the court were unanimous in their opinion that Cope was blameless. As Horace Walpole observed in a letter to Sir Horace Mann of 14 October 1746, &#145;Cope is come off most gloriously, his courage ascertained, and even his conduct, which everybody had given up, justified&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.320). Yet it was Cope's supposed incompetence that passed into legend: the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> described his part in the campaign against the Jacobites as &#145;ludicrous&#146;, and cited the rousing Jacobite song &#145;Hey, Johnnie Cope! are ye waukin yet?&#146; Thus Cope's nearly four decades of distinguished service were eclipsed by one incident that condemned him to lasting (and undeserved) ridicule.<br>
<br>Plagued by gout, Cope never again held a field command; in 1751 he was appointed to the staff in Ireland. After Prestonpans, according to gossip, Cope wagered that his successor would share his fate, and collected &pound;10,000 when Lieutenant-General Henry Hawley was duly beaten at Falkirk in January 1746. Cope died in London on 28 July 1760 and was survived by his second wife, Elizabeth, executor of his will. His only son, James Cope, MP for the Duncombe family borough of Downton from 1754, and a career diplomat, had died in 1756.<br>
