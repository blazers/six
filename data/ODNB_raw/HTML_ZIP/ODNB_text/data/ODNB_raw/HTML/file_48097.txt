<span class="headword">Pearson, Sir  James Reginald</span>  (1897&#150;1984), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born on 17 November 1897 in Dudley, Worcestershire, the son of George Henry Pearson, a fender moulder, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stringer. He attended a local infant school after which he moved to Park demonstration school, and later to Dudley higher elementary school. When he was fifteen he took up a machining apprenticeship at Bullers Ltd of Tipton with attendance at evening classes. During the First World War he joined the Royal Flying Corps but was withdrawn to do essential war work, taking up a post at the national projectile factory in Dudley. He became unemployed after the war and in 1919 travelled to Luton to seek work, eventually finding a position at Vauxhall Motors. His first position was as a centre-lathe turner in the machine shop. He was to remain at Vauxhall for the next forty-three years, rising through the ranks to a seat on the board. In 1925 he married Nellie Rose Vittery (<i>d</i>. 1977), a draper's daughter; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Pearson became a foreman in 1927, and two years later was again promoted, to area manager. He then progressed rapidly when his potential senior managerial qualities were recognized by the newly appointed managing director, Charles Bartlett, who in 1934 promoted him to assistant production manager, beginning a working relationship which spanned the following twenty years and encompassed the enormous expansion of the company through peace and war.<br>
<br>In 1939 Pearson was promoted to the crucial position of production manager, and became a key figure in the wartime production changeover from cars to Bedford army trucks, Churchill tanks, and other war material. Both as assistant and as production manager Pearson was in close contact with production workers and, having risen from the shop floor himself, felt a close affinity with them. In his managerial philosophy he recognized that close involvement with the workforce to foster good industrial relations was essential for co-operation and high productivity. The implementation of these aims was embodied in the group bonus system, which had been introduced in the 1920s. His aim was to make time-and-motion measured operations comfortable for employees and to ensure a reasonable bonus for each group of workers. Such a system, he felt, encouraged team effort and a harmonious working atmosphere, and, together with the close working relationship between managers and the workforce, was, he believed, responsible for the comparatively untrammelled industrial relations at Vauxhall up to the 1950s.<br>
<br>In 1942 Pearson was made factory manager and became the supremo of wartime production at the Luton plant. Despite air raids and bombing, which frequently disrupted production, his capable management resulted in a smooth return to work and the fulfilment of ordnance contracts which often meant working under great pressure. In 1946 he was appointed a director of Vauxhall and in 1950 made OBE in recognition of his service to British industry in peace and war. In 1953 he was appointed executive assistant to the managing director, and in 1958 he became deputy chairman. He was knighted in the following year, and retired from Vauxhall in 1962.<br>
<br>Sir Reg, as he was known to his friends, led an active life in retirement, becoming lord lieutenant of Bedfordshire, chairman of Dawley New Town corporation (1963&#150;8), and vice-president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The diversity of his other interests can be gauged by his membership of the Glyndebourne Festival Society and the English-Speaking Union, and his fellowship of the Royal Horticultural Society. He never lost his affection for Vauxhall and retained strong connections with it until his death. Living in nearby Harpenden he was called upon to act as guest speaker at numerous company functions, and was life president of its recreation club. He died at 220 Old Bedford Road, Luton, on 17 March 1984.<br>
