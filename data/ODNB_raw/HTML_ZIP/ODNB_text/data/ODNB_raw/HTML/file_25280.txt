<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheares,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born at Goldenbush, co. Cork, the fourth son of Henry Sheares (<i>d</i>. 1776), banker and MP, and Jane Anne Bettesworth (<i>d</i>. 1803) of Glasheen, co. Cork. He spent his early years at Glasheen and almost died in a swimming accident that claimed the life of his elder brother Robert, a tragedy for which he felt responsible. Two other brothers, Richard and Christopher, died in the 1770s when serving with the military in the West Indies. John Sheares was educated at home as a boy and then by the Revd G. Lee of Cork, who prepared him to enter Trinity College, Dublin. His eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_25279"></a><span class="headword">Henry Sheares</span>  (1753&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was also tutored at Glasheen before enrolling in Trinity in November 1773. Henry Sheares inherited the bulk of the family estate in May 1776 and resigned his commission in the 51st foot on half pay after three years' service.<br>
<br>John Sheares inherited &pound;3000 from his father but did not manage the cash well. His mother's will records an advance of &pound;500 to her &#145;late dear unfortunate son, John Sheares, as part of his provision when he came of age upon his being under some difficulties&#146;  (Madden, 3.199). He attended Trinity as a sixteen-year-old in 1783, graduated BA in 1787, and was called in 1788 to the Irish bar, where he was joined within a year by Henry. The brothers lodged in Dublin on Ormond Quay, along with Alicia Swete (1757&#150;1791), with whom Henry Sheares had eloped in August 1782, and their four children. Their marriage allegedly incensed rival suitor John FitzGibbon, earl of Clare. R. R. Madden ascertained that John Sheares's affair with a Mrs White in 1791 produced a daughter, Louisa, who was adopted by her relatives.<br>
<br>The death of Alicia Sheares on 11 December 1791 occasioned the removal of three of her children to France by their maternal grandmother. The Sheares brothers consequently visited Paris in 1792, where they engaged in political debates and met leading revolutionaries such as Brissot and Roland. In November 1792 Henry and John Sheares signed a document which called for close co-operation between the governments of Ireland, Britain, and France. The reputation of John Sheares later proved vulnerable to allegations that he was a fanatical Francophile who had taken a lugubrious interest in the revolutionary experience. Daniel O'Connell claimed that Sheares had once brandished a handkerchief said to have been stained with the blood of Louis XVI. Factual errors in O'Connell's anecdote were highlighted by Madden while other admirers insisted that John Sheares was deeply moved by the fate of Marie Antoinette and wept at Louis's trial. There is little doubt, however, but that the brothers were fervent supporters of the ideals of the French Revolution and attended the execution of the king on 21 January 1793 just days before leaving Calais for home.<br>
<br>After returning to Dublin John Sheares moved into 128 Baggot Street, a house leased by his brother in March 1792. Prior to the French sojourn the only overt signs of the radicalism for which John Sheares became notorious were several patriotic poems written when a teenager. This changed about June 1793 when the brothers joined the Society of United Irishmen to campaign for Catholic emancipation and other far-reaching democratic reforms. Both quickly attained prominence in the &eacute;lite Dublin society and chaired meetings in 1793&#150;4, profiles indicative of prior acquaintance with the leaders of what remained a small, legal, middle-class organization. Many of the most determined United Irishmen were barristers and the legal practice of John Sheares suffered more than most once his political inclinations were revealed. The principal reason for this seems to have been the extreme hostility of Clare, a formidable opponent who freely used the powers invested in his office as lord chancellor to combat the United Irishmen.<br>
<br>Clare set his sights on the Sheares brothers on 18 July 1793 when he alluded to them in the Irish House of Lords as &#145;two persons who were members of the French Jacobin Club &hellip; in the pay of that society, to foment sedition&#146;  (Kavanaugh, 288). Henry Sheares penned a robust handbill refutation of this attack and the ill will arising from the exchange had not diminished when John Sheares came close to locking horns with Clare in a controversy centred on Simon Butler. On 16 August 1793 John Sheares chaired the meeting which voted an address to Butler and Oliver Bond on their release from prison. He was angered by the chancellor's reiterated views on Butler's disloyalty and offered to deliver a verbal demand for either an apology or a duel. Fortunately for Sheares, the impropriety of engaging him on this errand led to his substitution by the more tactful Archibald Hamilton Rowan in early October. John Sheares had already acted as second to his barrister colleague and fellow United Irishman Leonard McNally in a politically motivated duel with Sir Jonah Barrington in April 1793.<br>
<br>In 1794 John Sheares became romantically linked to a Maria Steele of Merrion Square, daughter of the deceased Sir R. Parker Steele. This remained a secret from her mother until 1798 when Lady Steele registered her opposition to marriage owing to John's irreligiousness. His gravitation towards the more militant faction of United Irishmen may be inferred from his presence at the funeral of the Revd William Jackson in May 1795. Jackson's offer of French military aid to the United Irishmen had resulted in the banning of the society in May 1794 and the resignation of most moderates. John Sheares, though probably not a member of the inner circle of senior activists who transformed the movement into an underground, paramilitary organization, was privy to their general plans. Henry Sheares also remained active and, as William Drennan noted in October 1794, devised the scheme to reorganize the United Irishmen as a secret, cellular body. In late 1794 or early 1795 Henry Sheares met Sarah Neville of Mary Mount, Kilkenny (sister of Sir Robert Hudson), whom he married; they had two children prior to 1798. He may then have distanced himself from the day-to-day affairs of the Dublin organization but by March 1798 was once again conspiring with his more radical brother.<br>
<br>The supposed weakness of the conspiracy in the Cork region in 1798 has been attributed to the incompetence of the Sheares brothers, but recent scholarship indicates that the region failed to revolt for reasons that arose after their arrest. The main role fulfilled by John Sheares after October 1797 was to contribute articles to the radical <span class="italic">Press</span> newspaper using the pen-name Dion. Edited by Cork republican Arthur O'Connor, the paper became the main organ of the United Irishmen until its suppression in March 1798. John Sheares proved a skilled propagandist and may have authored several seditious documents in the advent of the 1798 rising. He reputedly considered going to France as an emissary in 1797 but this offer was rejected if ever made. The theory that his youth was at issue is highly unlikely, as is the story that professional hardship arising from Clare's persecution disposed him to contemplate emigration in December 1797. Extant evidence points to John Sheares's deepening ideological commitment and increasing influence within the movement. In the early months of 1798 the brothers joined William Lawless in subverting Irish militiamen based at Lehaunstown, co. Dublin. Neutralizing this reserve camp became more important during the spring when coercion made deep inroads into United Irish arms stocks and personnel.<br>
<br>The arrest of most of the United Irish leadership at Oliver Bond's on 12 March 1798 thrust John Sheares into the first echelon of the revolutionary leadership. He was not entirely trusted by the tight-knit coterie headed by Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Samuel Neilson but was a <i>de facto</i> member of the new directory. His presence in Cork on seditious business was in April 1798 made known to the authorities, who neglected to act at that time. He also attended spring assizes at Wexford and Kildare where he conferred with senior United Irishmen under the cover of legal affairs. On 10 May John Sheares was introduced to Captain John Warneford Armstrong of the King's county militia in the Grafton Street premises of radical bookseller Patrick Byrne. Armstrong feigned disloyalty during this chance encounter and aroused the interest of Sheares, who was anxious to strengthen the United Irish grip on his regiment. Mass defections from the military then featured strongly in United Irish strategy as it offered an alternative to French assistance. John Sheares hoped that republican soldiers would spearhead an irresistible <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in the capital and obviate the need for the more risky national insurrection favoured by Neilson. Such tactical arguments led to a fissure between John Sheares and Neilson in early May and his isolation from the leadership. When John Sheares called to visit Lawless on 21 May he was arrested by Town Major Henry Charles Sirr, who had been searching the house on the basis of information supplied by Armstrong. Henry Sheares was then seized in Baggot Street by Alderman Alexander just two days before the planned uprising.<br>
<br>The brothers were questioned in Dublin Castle by their unsympathetic relative Lord Shannon, who noted that they &#145;would confess nothing but were much frightened&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord Shannon's Letters</span>, 98). They were committed to Kilmainham prison until 4 July, when they were both arraigned on charges of high treason before Chief Justice Carleton. McNally, a government double agent when ostensibly Henry Sheares's friend and defence lawyer, helped ensure the conviction of his client on 12&#150;13 July by insisting that he be tried alongside the more incriminated John. The younger Sheares anticipated capital conviction and prepared farewell letters ahead of the trial. Armstrong's willingness to prosecute gave the government a strong case, as did their possession of an inflammatory document attributed to John Sheares which had been intended for distribution after the insurrection commenced. He privately acknowledged authorship on the eve of his death but it is unclear whether the proclamation had been sanctioned by the directory. John Philpot Curran, the main defence lawyer, could do little to undermine such clear-cut evidence and his motion to adjourn was dismissed by Attorney-General John Toler.<br>
<br>The brothers were found guilty on the morning of 13 July and committed to Newgate prison to await execution the following day. The capital conviction of Henry Sheares surprised many and it was held that an appeal might well succeed. Nothing came of this as there was insufficient time to prepare a case between sentencing and the prompt execution date of the following afternoon. Barrington acknowledged receiving an overdue letter from Henry at 11 a.m. on 14 July and, as directed by his desperate college friend, showed it to Clare. Assent was received that Henry's life would be spared if he co-operated with the authorities but Barrington reached Newgate too late to furnish the stay of execution. It is extremely doubtful whether Sheares would have accepted such terms and he presumably hoped to delay proceedings long enough for the verdict to be challenged on a point of law.<br>
<br>John and Henry Sheares appeared dressed in black at about three o'clock on 14 July and advanced hand in hand to the public gallows outside Newgate. Their heads were removed after death and, in a rare gesture for the period, the bodies were surrendered to a family member, Brent Neville, to be laid out in St Michan's crypt, Dublin, the same day. John Sheares was survived by his daughter, Louisa, Henry by his widow and six children, Henry, Richard Benjamin, Alicia, Jane, Garrett, and Mary.<br>
