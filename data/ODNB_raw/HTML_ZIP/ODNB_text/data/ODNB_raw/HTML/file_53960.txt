<span class="headword">Mantell,  Walter Baldock Durrant</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naturalist and colonial civil servant</span>, elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18004/', "Gideon Algernon Mantell (1790&#150;1852)")</script>, geologist and palaeontologist, and his wife, Mary Ann Woodhouse (1795&#150;1869), was born at Castle Place, Lewes, Sussex, on 11 March 1820. It was intended that he should be a surgeon and naturalist and he was apprenticed to his father in 1835. When this arrangement became unworkable, he served out the remainder of his apprenticeship (1836&#150;9) under Ambrose Dodd (1806&#150;1847) of Chichester.<br>
<br>Mantell refused a partnership with his father and emigrated to New Zealand, having been granted free passage on the <i>Oriental</i> in September 1839 as part of the Wakefield colonization scheme. On arrival the following January he took up land at Wainui but soon returned to town and accepted employment with the New Zealand Land Company, helping settlers at Wanganui and Taranaki. Between December 1840 and February 1844 he was variously clerk to the magistrates at Wellington, postmaster, and sub-collector of customs. In 1845 he was appointed superintendent of military roads, a position which brought him into contact with the Maori, and enabled him to learn their language. In 1848 he was appointed commissioner for the extinguishment of native titles in Middle (later South) Island. In this capacity he bought from the Ngai Tahu Maori some 30 million acres of land in exchange for cash and such promised improvements as schools, hospitals, and reserves. In 1851 he was appointed commissioner of crown lands for Otago and a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>An active naturalist, Mantell sent large quantities of New Zealand specimens and much information to colleagues in England, including his father, Richard Owen, Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, and John Gould. The specimens were primarily bones of the moa (<i>Dinornis maximus</i>), a large flightless bird only 200 years extinct. He also found, alive, the tahake (<i>Notornis mantelli</i>) and the North Island brown kiwi (<i>Apteryx australis mantelli</i>), both of which were named for him. The kiwi became a national symbol of New Zealand.<br>
<br>As a condition of his paternal inheritance, Mantell necessarily took a leave of absence and returned to England for three years (1856&#150;9), where he met the distinguished naturalists he had assisted, was elected to the Zoological and Geological societies, and established further friendships with Thomas Carlyle and his literary circle: Jane Carlyle (1801&#150;1866) described Mantell as &#145;a proud, shy man&#146;  (Howe, chap. 8); Geraldine Jewsbury (1812&#150;1880) began a close association with him; others resented his caustic wit. Mantell was infuriated when the British government refused to honour promises he had made to the Ngai Tahu in good faith and resigned his commissioner's position.<br>
<br>On returning to New Zealand in 1859 Mantell entered politics and was elected to the house of representatives for 1861&#150;5. An outspoken friend of the Maori, he was twice appointed native minister and twice resigned. In 1869 he married Mary Sarah Prince (<i>d</i>. 1873), with whom he already had a son (<i>b</i>. 1864). In 1866 he was appointed to the legislative council, serving until his death, at Sydney Street, Wellington, on 7 September 1895. He was buried in Wellington. Mantell contributed numerous papers to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute</span>, of which he was a founder and sometime secretary. He was also president of the Wellington Philosophical Society (1870) and occasionally acting director of the Geological Survey and Colonial Museum. Following the death of his first wife he married, on 10 January 1876, Jane Hardwick (<i>d</i>. 1906).<br>
