<span class="headword">Pechell, Sir  Paul</span>, first baronet  (1724&#150;1800), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, the second son of Jacob Pechell (1679&#150;1750), army officer, and his wife, Jane, daughter of John Boyd, was born at Owenstown, co. Kildare, on 12 November 1724. His father, Jacob, served in the British army and adopted the war office spelling Pechell. His grandfather, Samuel de P&eacute;chels (1644&#150;1720), sieur de la Boissade, a native of Montauban, Languedoc, France, was ejected from his estate following Louis XIV's revocation of the edict of Nantes in October 1685. In a brief narrative  (printed in <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span>, 26.116) he related how, after the &#145;missionary&#146; dragoons entered Montauban, he was imprisoned at Cahors, and in 1687 taken to Montpellier, whence he was transported to the French West Indies. He escaped from St Domingo to Jamaica in 1688 and, after many hardships, reached England that autumn. His wife escaped separately, but his mother and youngest sister remained imprisoned in France. In August 1689 he accompanied William III to Ireland as a lieutenant in Schomberg's Huguenot regiment, and in January 1690 William&#151;who valued Huguenot officers&#151;granted him a pension. He subsequently acquired the estate of Owenstown, co. Kildare, died at Dublin in 1720, and was buried in St Anne's Church there.<br>
<br>Paul Pechell entered the army as cornet-en-second in the Royal regiment of dragoons (1st dragoons) on 17 March 1744. He was promoted captain in Brigadier-General Fleming's regiment (36th foot), later 2nd battalion, Worcestershire regiment, on 12 December 1746. At the beginning of 1747 the 36th embarked at Gravesend to join the army of the duke of Cumberland in Flanders. Pechell was at operations near the frontiers of Holland, which led to the battle of Lauffeld or Val, near Maastricht, on 2 July 1747. His regiment lost two officers, two sergeants, and twenty-two rank and file, and he was among the wounded. He received from the duke of Cumberland &#145;the greatest commendation&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 27 July 1747).<br>
<br>After the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle on 7 October 1748, the establishment of the regiment was reduced on its return to England, and Pechell was gazetted captain in the 3rd dragoon guards on 31 May 1751. In the spring of 1752 the regiment escorted George II to Harwich, whence the king embarked for Hanover, and for the next three years the regiment was on coast duty suppressing smuggling in Suffolk, Essex, and Devon and patrolling against highway robbers. Pechell was gazetted guidon and captain in the second troop of the Horse Grenadier Guards (later the 2nd Life Guards) on 25 November 1754, lieutenant and captain on 5 July 1755, major on 7 February 1759, and lieutenant-colonel on 20 January 1762.<br>
<br>Pechell retired from the service on 24 June 1768, receiving a lump sum for his commission. He had married, on 11 February 1752, Mary (<i>d</i>. October 1800), only daughter and heir of Thomas Brooke, of Paglesham, Essex, and they had two sons and five daughters. He was created a baronet on 1 March 1797, and died, possibly at Paglesham, on 13 January 1800. His eldest son, Major-General Sir Thomas Brooke Pechell, second baronet (1753&#150;1826), was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21736/', "Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel John Brooke Pechell, third baronet (1785&#150;1849)")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21734/', "Admiral Sir George Richard Brooke Pechell, fourth baronet (1789&#150;1860)")</script>.<br>
