<span class="headword">Stothard,  Charles Alfred</span>  (1786&#150;1821), <span class="occ">antiquarian draughtsman</span>, was born in London on 5 July 1786, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26603/', "Thomas Stothard (1755&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, Rebecca Watkins (1760/61&#150;1824). He was educated in Latin by the renowned teacher and Baptist minister Robert Burnside and early showed talent for drawing. In January 1807 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, and in 1811 he exhibited there <span class="italic">The Assassination of Richard II</span>, in which the costumes were depicted with considerable historical accuracy. In the same year he published the first number of the <span class="italic">Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</span>, a work designed to portray the changes in English costume from the twelfth century to the reign of Henry VIII. The work was issued in twelve parts, each consisting of twelve separate plates, of which the first ten were prepared by Stothard himself; the last two, issued after his death, were the work of other artists. The letterpress was supplied by his friend and brother-in-law, the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15336/', "Alfred John Kempe")</script>, and the last number appeared in 1832. The <span class="italic">Effigies</span> became an important sourcebook for Victorian historical genre painters in their search for accurate details of historical costumes. It was, for instance, almost certainly the source for the figures of Edward III and the Black Prince in Ford Madox Brown's <span class="italic">Chaucer at the Court of Edward III</span> (1856&#150;68, Tate collection). Its continuing usefulness was evident when a new edition, with considerable additions, edited by John Hewitt, was published in 1876. <br>
<br>In 1815 Stothard was employed by Daniel Lysons to make drawings for <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span>, and for this purpose he journeyed through northern England as far as Hadrian's Wall. During his absence Lysons procured him the appointment of historical draughtsman to the Society of Antiquaries. In 1816 he was commissioned by the society to make drawings of the Bayeux tapestry, and during his stay in Normandy he discovered in a cellar at the abbey of Fontevrault effigies of several of the Plantagenet sovereigns. Stothard's was the first detailed record of the tapestry since Abb&eacute; Montfau&ccedil;on's drawings of 1730, postdating the damage done at the French Revolution and predating the first recorded major restoration of 1842. Stothard's drawings were both detailed and accurate; he even counted the stitch holes where threads were missing and recorded any traces of colour he found there. The evidence supplied by these drawings assisted in subsequent restorations of the tapestry itself. The drawings took two years to complete and were later engraved by J. Basire; they were published between 1821 and 1823 in the society's <span class="italic">Vetusta monumenta</span> (vol. 6, plates 1&#150;17). In 1819 Stothard presented a valuable paper on the date of the tapestry to the Society of Antiquaries (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 19.184). In this essay Stothard for the first time pointed out that the tapestry might be contemporary with the events it depicted without being the work of Matilda, queen of William of Normandy, with whom it was traditionally associated, and conclusively proved, from the accuracy of the costumes, that it could not be a work of twelfth-century date, as had been contended by the Abb&eacute; de la Rue. On 2 July of the same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. <br>
<br>In February 1818 Stothard married the writer Anna Eliza Kempe, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3291/', "Anna Eliza Bray (1790&#150;1883)")</script>, the daughter of John Kempe, <i>porteur d'or</i> at the Royal Mint, and the sister of his friend. He illustrated his wife's first publication, <span class="italic">Letters Written during a Tour through Normandy, Brittany, and other Parts of France in 1818</span> (1820). The following year he copied the thirteenth-century murals in the painted chamber of the Palace of Westminster. On 28 May 1821 he was engaged in tracing a stained-glass window in the church at Beer Ferris in Devon when the step of his ladder gave way and he fell, hitting his head on a monument below, and was killed instantly. His wife gave birth to their daughter, Blanch, on 29 June, but the child died in February the following year. Anna Eliza later married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3293/', "Edward Atkyns Bray")</script> and wrote a memoir of her first husband, <span class="italic">Memoirs, Including Original Journals, Letters, Papers, and Antiquarian Tracts of the Late Charles Alfred Stothard</span>, published in 1823.<br>
