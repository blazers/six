<span class="headword">Campbell family of Cawdor</span>  (<em>per. </em>1511&#150;1821), <span class="occ">highland chiefs, landowners, and politicians</span>, provide a rare example of a Campbell family based some distance from Argyll which until the end of the seventeenth century, following the pattern of the clan, remained closely associated with its chief and his affairs. The family was founded by the marriage in 1511 of <a name="cosubject_75460"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1546)<span class="occ"></span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4468/', "Archibald Campbell, second earl of Argyll (d. 1513)")</script>, to Muriel (1498&#150;<i>c</i>.1575), daughter of John Calder (<i>d</i>. 1498) and heir of her grandfather's modest but fertile lands near Nairn and Inverness, known as the thanedom of Calder or Cawdor; famously abducted as an infant after her father's death, Muriel was brought up in Argyll. A thane was a pre-Norman district ruler, and although in 1476 Calder had been granted the liberties and privileges of a barony, Muriel almost a century later was still describing her lands as the thanedom and barony of Cawdor. The earl of Argyll saw these lands as a useful outpost from which to further Campbell interests in the north. In spite of his wife's inheritance, however, which was unsuccessfully disputed by her Calder uncles, Sir John maintained his links with the west and wove a web of alliances among the clans there. One of his sisters had married Lachlan Maclean of Duart, who exposed her below high tide on &#145;Lady's rock&#146; near Duart, whence she was rescued and taken home to Inveraray. Sir John took his revenge with a party of fourteen men on 10 November 1523, when he broke into a house in Edinburgh &#145;under silence of night&#146; and murdered Duart in his bed. For this he received a remission in 1524. Family tradition suggests that only after this did Sir John make his home in the north, in a castle previously built or extended and fortified by the Calders in 1454&#150;5, and begin to make alliances with his neighbours, extend his possessions, and encourage his younger sons to found families there. He died in spring 1546.<br>
<br>Sir John was followed by Archibald (<i>d</i>. 1551), the eldest of his five sons, who died just five years later. Muriel, who seems to have been a redoubtable lady, survived until about 1575. Archibald, who in 1545 married Isabel Grant of Frenchie, was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_75461"></a><span class="headword">John Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592)<span class="occ"></span>, for whom his uncle John Campbell, prior of Ardchattan and later bishop of the Isles, acted as tutor. In 1575 John married Mary, daughter of William Keith, fourth Earl Marischal, and younger sister of Annas or Agnes Keith, widow of the regent Moray and now married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4483/', "Colin Campbell (c.1542&#150;1584)")</script>, and mother of his heir. This marriage led Cawdor once more firmly into the Argyll circle. On his death in 1584 Colin left a nine-year-old son, over whose upbringing there arose much (uncharacteristic) trouble among the Campbell gentry. Cawdor was nominated by the late earl as one of the six curators and, along with Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglass and Neil Campbell, bishop of Argyll, one of three principals. In a bond dated 1586 between Cawdor and Campbell of Lochnell on the subject of the custody and management of the young seventh earl, there is a reference to &#145;the abuse of thais quhilk keipis my lord of Argyllis body&#146;  (Innes, 188). They were clearly trying to reduce the influence of Ardkinglass, who was, however, supported by the powerful Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. There was already a close link between the earls of Moray and Argyll owing to their strong protestant background and family relationship, and Cawdor was also involved with Moray over his lands in the north, where there was great rivalry between Moray and the earl of Huntly. Cawdor, with the earls of Atholl and Moray, was part of a group who in 1590 formed an offensive and defensive alliance apparently directed against Huntly. In the same year the young earl of Argyll, now aged fourteen, chose his own nine curators, of whom once again Cawdor was a principal, with Campbell of Lochnell in place of Ardkinglass. A widespread plot led to a contract by which seven signatories, including Huntly and Campbell of Glenorchy, aimed &#145;to cut of and slay&#146; Argyll, his brother Colin, Moray, and Campbell of Cawdor  (Macphail, 184). Accordingly on 4 February 1592 Cawdor, while sitting by the fire in a house at Knipoch near Oban, was killed by three or four shots fired from &#145;ane long hagbit&#146;  (ibid., 154). John Campbell of Ardkinglass, who had succeeded his father in 1591, had been easily persuaded by Glenorchy to arrange this, and it was he who confessed to implication in the murder. Three days later came the better-known assassination of the &#145;bonnie earl of Moray&#146; at Donibristle by Huntly. Argyll and his brother survived.<br>
<br>The aftermath of the murders left chaos in the north and the highlands were said to be like a huge harp of which it was impossible to touch one string without setting the others jangling. But the Campbells managed to restore clan unity, in the pursuit of which in 1601 <a name="cosubject_75462"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1642)<span class="occ"></span>, son and heir of the murdered laird, married Jean, daughter of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. Meanwhile various branches of the clan Donald were afflicted by internal strife, which they were unable to bring under control; one who was to benefit from this was Donald Campbell, natural son of the murdered Cawdor. He became involved in northern affairs through marriage with Jean Campbell, widow of Angus Mackintosh the younger of Torcastle and mother of the young heir who succeeded as chief in 1606 and to whom Donald was curator. Donald Campbell also kept a close interest in the west and later acquired Macdonald lands in Ardnamurchan, including the castle of Mingary, and also parts of Appin with the spectacular Castle Stalker on its rock in Loch Linnhe.<br>
<br>The rifts in the clan Donald also provided the background for the younger Cawdor's greatest acquisition. For a brief period after 1519 Sir John Campbell had undertaken the administration of the MacIan lands on Islay, but the interest of his great-grandson Sir John in that fertile island revived through the marriage of his sister Margaret to Sir John Macdonald of Dunyvaig, whose family held most of it in the 1590s. Turmoil among the island clans resulted in rebellion in 1614 and Cawdor, backed by Argyll and the privy council, was ordered to lead an expedition to Islay, where he took the castles of Dunyvaig and Lochgorme. In 1615 he arranged to buy the forfeited Macdonald lands from Argyll for sums which proved to be so large&#151;his debts were said at one point to have amounted to 100,000 merks&#151;that he had to sell silver and some land in the north to raise the money, and later generations are said to have regretted the purchase. Cawdor devolved Islay to his son John Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1654), who was declared insane in 1639 during his father's lifetime and whose affairs until his death were managed first by Cawdor's brother Colin Campbell of Ardersier (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1642) and then by a younger brother, George Campbell. An attempt was made to develop Islay by settling friends and supporters there and by trying to raise profits from the island, including an attempt to &#145;drawe in Inglische men to Ila boithe for the fisching and leid myneis&#146;  (Innes, 250) and by building up a large cattle trade.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77417"></a><span class="headword">Sir Hugh Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (<em>c.</em>1639&#150;1716)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Colin Campbell of Ardersier and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of David Brodie of Brodie, succeeded to the family estates in 1654. In 1660 he was made the ward of the earl of Lauderdale. In 1661, soon after coming of age, he was elected to the Scottish parliament as MP for Nairnshire, for which he continued to sit until 1693. In January 1662 he was contracted to marry Lady Henrietta Stewart, daughter of James, fourth earl of Moray, and the niece of Lauderdale's wife. They had four sons and four daughters. Sir Hugh was active in Scottish politics throughout the Restoration period. He did not join Argyll's rebellion in 1685, but supported the revolution of 1688&#150;9 and was appointed to the Scottish privy council in May 1689. Some suspected his loyalty given the marriage in March 1689 of his second son, Archibald, to the daughter of Duncan Macpherson of Cluny, a Jacobite, and he was suspected of providing Viscount Dundee with information on council deliberations. During the first session of the 1690 parliament he was a member of the Club opposition, and he failed to attend the second session of 1690. He was not reappointed to the privy council in March 1692, but he was excepted from pardon in James II's proclamation of April 1692. He relinquished his seat in parliament to his son, Alexander, in 1693, probably owing to ill health. In 1704 he published his <span class="italic">Essay on the Lord's Prayer</span>, which advocated the use of the Lord's prayer in public worship. The suppression of his letters to the general assembly on this issue led to the publication of his correspondence with the moderators of the general assembly when the <span class="italic">Essay</span> was republished in 1709. Sir Hugh was an opponent of the union of 1707, believing that &#145;a federal union and free trading would certainly be an advantage&#146;  (Innes, 405). He condoned the mobilization of Cawdor men for the Pretender (James Edward Stuart) on 19 September 1715, delegating his authority to his grandson, Duncan Campbell, son of Sir Archibald Campbell of Cluny. His death on 11 March 1716 may have prevented the forfeiture of his estates. He was buried on 29 March.<br>
<br>Sir Hugh Campbell's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_77418"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Campbell the younger of Cawdor</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1697)<span class="occ"></span>, predeceased his father. After matriculating at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1677, Alexander travelled abroad to France and possibly to Italy. In September 1688 he was contracted to marry Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1714), daughter of Sir John Lort, second baronet, of Stackpole Court, Pembrokeshire, and Lady Susannah Holles. They had two sons&#151;the elder, Gilbert, died in 1711&#151;and two daughters, one of whom, Susannah, married in 1718 Sir James Campbell, fifth baronet. Alexander sat for Nairnshire in the Scottish parliament in 1693&#150;5, but died shortly after, on 27 August 1697. In 1698 his wife, Lady Campbell, succeeded her brother, Sir Gilbert Lort, third baronet, to the family's Welsh estates. Henceforth, the Campbells of Cawdor ceased to be merely Scottish landowners (with lands primarily in eastern Inverness-shire and Nairnshire, with control also of the islands of Islay and Jura), and became more British in their orientation with extensive interests in Wales. Indeed, there seems to have been some hostility to the Scots within the Lort family, Lady Lort's will making bequests contingent on her grandsons not marrying North Britons. Lady Campbell resided in England with her affairs closely watched over by her brother's friend, Edward Harley, brother of Robert, earl of Oxford from 1711.<br>
<br>Sir Hugh Campbell was succeeded by his grandson <a name="cosubject_64144"></a><span class="headword">John Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (1695&#150;1777)<span class="occ"></span>, and given his grandfather's actions in 1715 it was perhaps rather fortuitous that John had spent most of his childhood in England and Wales and avoided any real taint of Jacobitism. John was educated in England, entering Lincoln's Inn in London in 1708 and Clare College, Cambridge, in 1711. John succeeded his mother in 1714 and his grandfather in 1716. His actions in the personal, commercial, and political spheres reveal just how far he had moved beyond the traditional concerns and agendas of a highland laird. Following his father's example he married, on 30 April 1726, Mary (<i>d</i>. in or before 1777), daughter of Lewis Pryse of Gogerddan, Cardiganshire; they had three sons and three daughters. This new Welsh connection gave John access to coal-rich estates and enabled him, in 1727, to sell the islands of Islay and Jura to the family's major creditor, Daniel Campbell of Shawfield, for &pound;12,000. Initially John Campbell was MP for Pembrokeshire from 1727 to 1747, though in the election of 1734 he was returned for both the Welsh county and Nairnshire, the first MP since the union to be elected simultaneously north and south of the border. Despite his family's Jacobite antecedents, John was very much a supporter of first Robert Walpole, then the Pelhams (to whom he was related through his maternal grandmother), and above all Henry Fox. His political loyalty resulted in his appointment as a lord of the Admiralty from 1736 to 1742, and then as a lord of the treasury from June 1746 until the parliamentary election of 1754. In 1747, unsure of his electoral prospects in Wales, John `had fallen back on his family's traditional power base in Nairnshire, where his hereditary sheriffdom was to be valued at &pound;2000 under the terms of the <span class="roman">Jurisdictions Act</span>. Having held Nairnshire from 1747 to 1754 and with the approval of Henry Pelham and the third duke of Argyll, he sat as MP for the Inverness-shire burghs from 1754 to 1761, defeating the strong challenge mounted by Sir Alexander Grant. During the political upheavals of 1755&#150;7, Campbell was very much opposed to the prospect of William Pitt the elder's becoming a leading figure in government. Although he was persuaded by his political ally Henry Fox to sit as MP for Corfe Castle from December 1762 to 1768, he took a much less active role after his return to the Commons. He died on 6 September 1777.<br>
<br>From as early as the 1761 election, leadership of the family interest had effectively devolved upon John Campbell's first son, <a name="cosubject_64143"></a><span class="headword">Pryse Campbell of Cawdor</span>  (1727&#150;1768)<span class="occ"></span>, politician. Having matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1745, Pryse married on 20 September 1752 Sarah (1726&#150;1767), daughter and heir of Sir Edmund Bacon, sixth baronet, of Garboldisham, Norfolk; they had four sons and three daughters. Initially Pryse seemed destined for a successful political career, not least because, unlike his father, he was a strong supporter of Pitt the elder. In 1754 he was returned as MP for Inverness-shire with the co-operation of Argyll, who, though supportive of the political pretensions of Simon Fraser of Lovat, believed that the erstwhile Jacobite's re-entry into county politics was premature and would certainly offend sensibilities in London. Competition with the Lovat interest remained, however. Clearly aware that Fraser's acquisition of a Highland regiment in January 1757 heightened his political credibility with Inverness-shire voters, Pryse refused to assist in the recruitment process; but it was his support for the <span class="roman">Irish Cattle Importation Act</span> during February and March 1759 that deeply damaged his relationship with his constituents. By February 1761 Argyll had made it clear he would oppose reselection of Pryse for Inverness-shire, with the result that the latter, with the support of the earl of Bute, stood for and won the Nairnshire seat. Having been created a lord of treasury in August 1766 and re-elected to parliament on 4 December 1766, he still faced the fact that under the Scottish electoral system Nairnshire would not be represented at the next election. He switched to his Welsh interest and was elected for the Cardigan Boroughs on 24 March 1768, but died on 14 December of the same year.<br>
<br>His first son, <a name="cosubject_64142"></a><span class="headword">John Pryse Campbell</span>, first Baron Cawdor of Castlemartin  (1755&#150;1821)<span class="occ"></span>, politician and army officer, was born on 24 April 1755. He studied first at Eton College (1763&#150;7), before entering Clare College, Cambridge, in 1772. Although he was brought up in Wales and England and knew little of Scotland, his political career commenced north of the border when he sat as MP for Nairnshire from 18 April 1777 until May 1780, when he vacated his seat to take over the Cardigan Boroughs seat vacated by Thomas Johnes. He was then returned for Cardigan Boroughs at the 1780 general election, and thereafter he held the now traditional Welsh seat of the Cawdor family until 1796. A strong supporter of Lord North, he helped to recruit the 75th regiment from south Wales in 1777, and voted against the peace preliminaries in early 1783. Although he was initially neutral on the administration of William Pitt the younger, Campbell's marriage on 28 July 1789 to Lady Isabella Caroline Howard (1771&#150;1848), daughter of Frederick, fifth earl of Carlisle, not only demonstrated the family's final integration into the British landed &eacute;lite, but also hastened Campbell's drift into opposition circles. He voted for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> in Scotland and became associated with the moderate Portland whigs. By March 1794, however, as the scale and scope of the conflict with the French intensified, Campbell, along with the rest of Portland's parliamentary interest, joined Pitt's administration. The posts held by Campbell during this period give some indication of how far the family's horizons were now dominated by their Welsh, as opposed to Scottish, interests. Governor of Milford Haven from 1780 until his death, Campbell was commissioned as a captain in the Castlemartin yeomanry from 1794 to 1802 and captain in the Pembrokeshire Volunteers in 1803, as well as lieutenant-colonel-commandant of the Royal Carmarthenshire militia from 1798 and brevet colonel from 1799 to 1821. In his capacity as an officer of the Castlemartin yeomanry Campbell was to gain the distinction of being largely responsible for repulsing the attempted French landings in Pembrokeshire in 1797. His demonstrable loyalty had in fact already been rewarded when, on 21 June 1796, he was created Baron Cawdor of Castlemartin. His local influence in Wales was confirmed in 1808 when he became mayor of Carmarthen, a position enhanced by his reputation as an improving landlord. He died at Great Pulteney Street, Bath, on 1 June 1821, and was buried in the town's abbey eight days later.<br>
<br>Mirroring their political development, the Campbell family's commercial concerns during the eighteenth century had focused increasingly on their valuable Welsh estates. By 1789 John Pryse Campbell had an income of &pound;11,000&#150;12,000 per annum. In political terms, however, the connection with the north of Scotland remained strong. A survey of Inverness-shire in 1788 revealed that Campbell held 7 votes of a total of 103; in Nairnshire, meanwhile, the family retained 8 votes out of a total of 20. Moreover, although they were increasingly absentee landlords, the family continued to direct commercial developments on their Scottish estates. During the period from the later 1710s until his death in 1744, another of Sir Hugh's grandsons, Sir Archibald Campbell of Cluny, managed the estate. He initiated various improvements, not least by creating an impressive oak plantation in and around Castle Cawdor during the 1730s. A year after his death an attempt was made to ensure protection for Cawdor tenantry by subscribing to the cattle watch of Ewan Macpherson of Cluny. Later a Welsh factor, Valentine White, was appointed to oversee the estate; he planted large amounts of hedgerow for enclosures and had created a series of planned crofts at Ardersier by the time John Campbell of Cawdor died in 1777. Improvements continued under John Pryse Campbell, with the opening up of marl pits for liming, as well as the abolition of feudal obligations upon the tenantry by the early 1790s. Perhaps only the continuing lack of systematic enclosures in the parish of Cawdor, noted by Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span>, reveals something of the estate-management drift that was a consequence of the family's evolution from highland lairds to gentry with British political and commercial interests.<br>
