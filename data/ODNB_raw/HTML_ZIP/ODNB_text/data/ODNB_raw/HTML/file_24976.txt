<span class="headword">Scudamore,  William Edward</span>  (1813&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and devotional writer</span>, only son of Dr Edward Scudamore and nephew of the physician Sir Charles Scudamore MD (1779&#150;1849), was born at Wye, Kent, on 24 July 1813. Having been educated at a school in Brussels, at Edinburgh high school, and then at Lichfield Cathedral school, he entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 6 July 1831, and graduated BA as ninth wrangler in 1835. He was on 14 March 1837 admitted a fellow of St John's, whence he proceeded MA in 1838. After a short time as assistant master at Oakham School, he went to Minto, Roxburghshire, as tutor in the family of Gilbert Elliot, second earl of Minto. Scudamore was ordained priest in 1839, and in March of that year was presented to the living of Ditchingham in Norfolk, then restricted to fellows of St John's. On 20 October 1840 he married Albina (1815/16&#150;7 June 1898), daughter of John King.<br>
<br>Scudamore's views were largely influenced by the Oxford Movement as expounded at Cambridge by John Fuller Russell. As the first resident rector at Ditchingham for almost a century, he restored the parish church, built a school, and raised subscriptions for a chapel of ease in an outlying portion of the parish. In 1854 he assisted Lavinia Crosse in the foundation at nearby Shipmeadow of a sisterhood and small penitentiary. In 1859 the community, named the Society of All Hallows, was moved to Ditchingham where it flourished under Scudamore's wardenship and took on responsibility for an orphanage and hospital. Scudamore devoted his leisure to patristic and liturgiological studies, which bore fruit in <span class="italic">Notitia eucharistica</span> (1872). He was influenced by the works of Richard Hooker and high-churchmen of the seventeenth century, but rejected the ritualist extremism of the English Church Union, with which he engaged in controversy (1872&#150;3).<br>
<br>Scudamore was most widely known for his devotional works, especially <span class="italic">Steps to the Altar</span> (1846), which had gone into sixty-seven editions by 1887, though his personal profit from its worldwide success amounted to only &pound;40. Scarcely less popular was his <span class="italic">Words to Take with Us</span> (1859). In addition to other works on church history and controversy he contributed some lengthy articles to Smith's and Cheetham's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span> (1875&#150;80). Scudamore died at Ditchingham rectory on 31 January 1881, and was buried in the parish cemetery. He and his wife, who outlived him by seventeen years, were survived by two sons and a daughter.<br>
