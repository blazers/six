<span class="headword">Kitching,  John Alwyne</span>  (1908&#150;1996), <span class="occ">cell physiologist and marine ecologist</span>, was born on 24 October 1908 in York, the younger child of John Nainby Kitching (1845&#150;1914), joint managing director of an engineering firm in Leeds, and his wife, Alice Edith, daughter of the Revd George Yeats, vicar of Heworth church in York. His elder sister died in infancy, and his father died of a heart attack when Alwyne, as he was known as a child, was five. His mother moved to Bournemouth, where Kitching attended preparatory school before moving on to Cheltenham College in 1922. During his early life he travelled widely in Europe with his mother, who was a watercolour artist and described her travels in a series of radio broadcasts in 1924. In these years Kitching developed strong interests in natural history and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1927 to study zoology, botany, and geology in the natural sciences tripos, graduating with a degree in zoology in 1931.<br>
<br>As a Cambridge undergraduate Kitching encountered the two principal topics which dominated his later career. An interest in cell physiology was aroused principally by Carl Pantin, and in marine ecology by G. A. Steven at Easter classes at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. These interests were consolidated during his appointment as lecturer at Birkbeck College, London. There he gained his PhD in 1933 through studies of the physiology of contractile vacuoles of protozoa. He also pioneered research in sublittoral marine ecology, with H. C. Gilson and T. T. Macan, as probably the first biological researcher to use a diving helmet. Kitching married Evelyn Mary Oliver, of Hendon, Middlesex, a biology graduate from Birkbeck, on 24 March 1934, and one son and three daughters were born over subsequent years.<br>
<br>After a brief lecturing appointment at Edinburgh, Kitching, now known to all as Jack, moved in 1937 to lecture at the University of Bristol. During a Rockefeller fellowship at Princeton University in 1938&#150;9 he collaborated with Daniel Pease in research on the effects of high pressure and modified gas concentrations on cells. He was to return to this interest after the war, but more immediately it may have led to his wartime work at the University of Toronto on problems associated with lack of oxygen at high altitudes and exposure of ditched aircrew to cold water. In 1947 he was appointed OBE for services to the RAF.<br>
<br>Kitching returned to his lectureship in Bristol in 1945, was promoted to a readership in 1949, and was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1960. In 1963 he was appointed to a chair in biology at the newly established University of East Anglia, where he acted as dean of the school of biological sciences from 1967 to 1970, and remained active there well after formal retirement in 1974. At both universities he pursued productive research in cell physiology. Using ingenious techniques, described in fourteen papers, he demonstrated the role of contractile vacuoles in removing excess water and controlling cell volume of protozoa. He and his students also performed studies on the effects of high hydrostatic pressures on protozoan cells, and especially on structures formed from microtubules, as well as studying the mechanism of suctorial feeding in suctorian ciliate protozoa and the effects of anaesthetic gases upon cell structures.<br>
<br>Kitching's summer vacations throughout were devoted to marine ecology, with support from numerous colleagues, most consistently F. John Ebling. They formed an effective pair, Kitching a shy but single-minded scientist and Ebling a gregarious organizer. Together they led annual expeditions, largely manned by students, to study the ecology of Lough Ine (or Hyne) in co. Cork. Sea water flows into and out of the fully saline lough through a narrow rapids channel, exposing marine organisms to strong currents. In earlier years many techniques including diving were used to investigate the physico-chemical features and the distribution of littoral and sublittoral organisms in the rapids, the lough, and the nearby coast. Later experimental work examined the dependence of the distribution of organisms on physico-chemical factors and predation. The results of this ground breaking research were described in thirty-four papers over more than forty years, earlier work being summarized by Kitching and Ebling in <span class="italic">Advances in Ecological Research</span> in 1967, and later work by Kitching in the same journal in 1987.<br>
<br>Kitching was a tall, impressive man, somewhat aloof, but most conscientious. He was interested in all aspects of the natural world, an enthusiastic gardener, an energetic traveller, and prolific photographer. He saw a pre-publication copy of his final work, <span class="italic">The Biology of Rocky Shores</span> (1996), jointly written with Colin Little, shortly before he died in Norwich on 1 April 1996. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
