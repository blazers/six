<span class="headword">Fry <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pease]</span>,  Sophia</span>, Lady Fry  (1837&#150;1897), <span class="occ">philanthropist and political activist</span>, was born on 11 June 1837 at East Mount, Darlington, co. Durham, the first of the two daughters of John Pease (1797&#150;1868), woollen manufacturer and director of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and Sophia Pease, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jowitt (<i>d</i>. 1870). Sophia Fry's outstanding contribution to philanthropy and politics was a consequence of the three main formative influences of her early life: the Quaker faith, Liberalism, and her family. The parental home at East Mount, Darlington, was run in accordance with Quaker culture and teachings, with an emphasis on philanthropy and public service. Sophia and her only sister, Mary Anna, were given an unusually well-rounded education: academic lessons from a governess were part of a regime which emphasized healthy outdoor pursuits and moral development. At the age of fourteen she spent one year at the Miss Taylors' school at Frenchay, near Bristol, where she developed a lifelong friendship with Sarah Sturge, who later married her cousin, Edward Pease, and first met her husband-to-be, Theodore Fry (1836&#150;1912), a scion of the family of cocoa and chocolate manufacturers.<br>
<br>They were married on 14 August 1862, and by all accounts theirs was a compatible and companionable union, producing eight children (four girls and four boys), and with shared interests in public service and politics. After an initial four years in Bristol, they set up a permanent home at Woodburn in Darlington, where Theodore became a partner in the iron-rolling mills at Rise Carr. He subsequently served on the town council, school board, and the board of guardians, and was mayor in 1877&#150;8. Sophia became involved in a number of religious, charitable, and educational activities in which her organizational flair and gift for public speaking began to mature.<br>
<br>Following family tradition, Sophia Fry had been drawn into visiting work from an early age, and developed a youthful interest in education for the poor. Her capacity for innovation was shown when, still a very young woman, she started a weekly class for pupil teachers, and set up a centre for cookery classes&#151;well before the development of domestic skills teaching in state elementary schools. After her marriage she helped to establish the Girls' Friends Day School in Bristol, and was active in the affairs of the Darlington High School for Girls, which was attended by her daughters. She ensured that women had a responsible share in the management of the British and Foreign School Society's North of England College to train mistresses for elementary schools, established in Darlington in 1879. A supporter of the Association for the Care of Girls and the Darlington Temperance Society, her broader philanthropic work included the running of mothers' meetings and savings clubs for women at the Hopetown mission. Perhaps her most significant contribution to the civic life of Darlington was a successful campaign to raise &pound;10,000 to build the general hospital, which was opened in 1884.<br>
<br>Sophia Fry was perhaps most notable for her pioneering work in encouraging women's active involvement in party politics and in establishing the national Women's Liberal Federation. The election of her husband as MP for Darlington in 1880 propelled her into campaigning and canvassing. Recognizing the valuable skills which women could bring to local constituency work, and inspired, as were others, by W. E. Gladstone's call to women during his Midlothian campaign, she set up a Women's Liberal Association (WLA) in Darlington in 1881, among the first in the country. Although the role of women in party politics was at this stage a contested one, she believed it to be their duty to work for the electoral success of the Liberal Party and thus to promote its stance on many of the great moral issues of the day. Later commentators have remarked that the experience she gained as an active philanthropist was the forerunner of her interest in politics. Aware of the need for local associations to have a national forum for communication and mutual development, she established the Women's Liberal Federation (WLF) in London in 1887, taking the position of honorary secretary, with Catherine Gladstone as a not very effective president. It quickly grew into a formidable organization of some 75,000 members and 360 local WLAs by 1892.<br>
<br>However, it also acquired a reputation for &#145;strong feminism&#146; and its national conferences aired many of the women's issues of the time. The most divisive and controversial of these was women's suffrage which Sophia, although personally in favour, rightly viewed as a threat to the harmonious working of the federation and a deflection from their main purpose of electing Liberals to office. When a group of rebel progressives succeeded in establishing women's suffrage as one of the official aims of the federation, Sophia led a group of moderates into forming a secessionist Women's National Liberal Association in 1892, which adhered to the WLF's original aims and preserved the important principle of local WLA autonomy. She became its first vice-president (1892&#150;7).<br>
<br>When her husband was created a baronet in 1894, Sophia assumed the title of Lady Fry. A serious accident while on holiday with her husband in Italy was the prelude to her untimely death the following year at the Grand Hotel, Biarritz, on 30 March 1897. She was buried in the Quaker meeting-house graveyard in Darlington on 3 April. Sir Theodore remarried in 1902. Sophia Fry is honoured for her pivotal role in bringing women to the fore of Liberal politics.<br>
