<span class="headword">Litton,  Edward Arthur</span>  (1813&#150;1897), <span class="occ">writer on theology</span>, was born at 14 Holles Street, Dublin, on 12 August 1813 and was baptized privately by his uncle, the Revd John Letabl&egrave;re. He was the eldest of the eight children of Edward Litton (1787&#150;1870) of Altmore, and his wife, Sophia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart); his father was master of the Irish court of chancery (1843&#150;70) and MP for Coleraine. Educated at Winchester College (1830&#150;31) and expected to study for the bar, he was enrolled as a student of Gray's Inn in 1829; ten years later he transferred his membership to Lincoln's Inn, although by then his career had moved away from jurisprudence. He matriculated in April 1832 from Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1835 graduated BA with a double first. Noted for his exemplary conduct and for his Calvinistic views which were said, in a testimonial from Frederick Oakeley, his tutor at Balliol, to have undergone a change, he was in 1836 elected a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. Having proceeded MA in 1840, he was granted the same degree at Durham in the following year. Ordained as a priest, he served until 1843 as a curate of St Ebbe's in Oxford. He then was dean of Oriel until the end of 1844, when he relinquished his fellowship because of his marriage a year earlier on 28 December 1843. His wife Anne (<i>d</i>. 1901) was the youngest daughter of the Revd William Carus Wilson of Casterton Hall, Westmorland, whose school at Cowan Bridge was attended by the Bront&euml; sisters, and who is unfairly portrayed as Brocklehurst in <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span>. In April 1844 Litton's sister Mary was married to his brother-in-law, William Carus Wilson junior. In 1850 Litton was described as the incumbent of Wilderspool, near Warrington, a living he had held since 1845.<br>
<br>Although, when a fellow of Oriel in 1842, Litton was described by A. H. Clough as &#145;exceedingly grave, silent and almost bashful&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.117), he had been aware of at least some of the developments in John Henry Newman's theological thinking. His rejection of the Tractarian emphasis on apostolic succession in his <span class="italic">The Church of Christ in its Idea, Attitudes and Ministry</span> (1851) marked Litton out as an evangelical leader at Oxford. It may also have contributed to his being chosen to succeed the evangelical John Hill as vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1851, but the Tractarian John Barrow was appointed principal in 1853 and Litton resigned in the following year.<br>
<br>With the institution in 1850 of a royal commission to investigate the state of the university at Oxford, Litton published a letter to Lord John Russell on university reform in 1851. When the subsequent <span class="roman">Oxford University Act</span> (1854) abolished the imposition of religious tests for members of the university and encouraged the establishment of private halls, licensed by the vice-chancellor, Litton was associated with the creation in 1855 of an evangelical hall at Oxford of which he was the master. However, Litton Hall never attracted many students and he closed it in 1860. The growing influence of liberalism in the university meant that his opposition to Tractarianism was something of an asset, and Litton was one of three evangelicals nominated during the 1850s to deliver the Bampton lectures, his subject being <span class="italic">The Mosaic Dispensation Considered as Introductory to Christianity</span> (1856). In the same year he was appointed an examining chaplain to the bishop of Durham&#151;a position which he retained under successive bishops until 1870.<br>
<br>From 1858 to early 1861 Litton was rector of St Clement's in Oxford, Newman's old parish church, but in 1861 he left Oxford on his appointment as rector of Naunton in Gloucestershire. It was there that he wrote his <span class="italic">Introduction to Dogmatic Theology</span> (2 vols., 1882, 1892), a magisterial work, more Lutheran than Calvinist and greatly valued by twentieth-century evangelical Anglicans, who have republished it several times. Litton died on 27 August 1897 at Kingstown, near Dublin.<br>
