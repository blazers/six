<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Bede Edmund Hugh</span>  (1890&#150;1969), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 3 July 1890 on his father's sheep farm in the South Island of New Zealand. He was the third and youngest son of William Hugh Clifford (1858&#150;1943), later tenth Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, and his wife, Catherine Mary, daughter of R. Bassett, a New Zealander. His mother died when he was very young, and he moved with his father from one unsuccessful farm to another. At an early age he displayed outstanding intelligence with an unorthodox bent. Although he entered a Melbourne boarding-school at the age of ten without knowing the alphabet, he became the star pupil. After a brief spell at Melbourne University he joined a firm of surveyors in Western Australia, but eventually signed on as fourth officer on a tramp steamer, of which his brother was the navigating officer, in order to reach England. He took the opportunity to master the use of the sextant for solar and stellar observations.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Clifford enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers and soon gained his commission. He was gassed and invalided and in 1917 was appointed aide-de-camp to Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson (later Viscount Novar), governor-general of Australia. He was quickly promoted to the more congenial position of private secretary (1918&#150;20) and was therefore privileged to meet with many famous figures. He accompanied Admiral Jellicoe on an inspection of the outlying defences of Australia, and for his services during the visit of the prince of Wales was appointed MVO. In 1921 Clifford was selected by Lord Milner as secretary to Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor-general of South Africa. J. C. Smuts, the prime minister, quickly appreciated Clifford's ability and consulted him on imperial problems.<br>
<br>In 1924 Clifford was appointed secretary to Prince Arthur's successor, the earl of Athlone; but in the same year he became imperial secretary to the South African high commission. The protectorates of Bechuanaland, Swaziland, and Basutoland being under his jurisdiction, he immediately carried out a detailed tour. In 1925 he married Alice Devin (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of John Murton Gundry, an eminent banker, of Cleveland, Ohio. His very beautiful and highly talented wife played a most important role in helping him in their arduous public life. They had three daughters famous for their beauty and wit.<br>
<br>In 1928 Clifford became the first white man to cross the Kalahari Desert, a fine feat of navigation. In 1929 and 1931 he surveyed the boundaries and determined the size of the Great Makarikari salt lake for a possible railway route from Southern Rhodesia to Walvis Bay. In the meantime J. B. M. Hertzog had applied for Clifford to be appointed (1928) first representative of the United Kingdom to the Union of South Africa. He was able to persuade Hertzog to defer constitutional changes until after he had attended the prime ministers' conference; and by subtle argument he persuaded the government to join in financing the Imperial Airways link with South Africa in spite of strong German competition. For his services in South Africa, Clifford was appointed CMG in 1923 and CB in 1931.<br>
<br>At the end of 1931 Clifford was appointed governor of the Bahamas, the youngest governor in the colonial service. Owing to his imagination and initiative in encouraging the development of the tourist industry the prosperity of the islands was greatly increased. He was promoted KCMG in 1933. In 1937 a visit to Germany convinced Clifford that war was inevitable. In the same year he was appointed governor of Mauritius, and during a visit to Diego Suarez <i>en route</i>, he made a careful study of the harbour defences which helped in its eventual capture.<br>
<br>On arrival in Mauritius, Clifford stimulated research for the improvement of the sugar and pineapple industries. In case of war, he laid in large stocks of coal, so that the railways could be maintained. He developed the hydroelectric and irrigation resources: a lasting contribution. He provided machinery for the regulation of wages and working conditions. His handling of industrial disputes was unorthodox but effective. When the docks were picketed to prevent the loading of sugar for export Clifford had a labour force recruited from the plantations. The men were transported in closed railway wagons into the port area with sufficient equipment and supplies to be self-supporting, and the strike was broken.<br>
<br>In 1942 Clifford was appointed governor of Trinidad, a very sensitive area in the U-boat campaign. His principal task was to resolve friction which had arisen between the resident British and American admirals, and this he was able to do with tact and firmness. In appreciation he was awarded the Legion of Merit by the United States government. He was able also to negotiate a most satisfactory agreement with Venezuela over the demarcation of the sea bed of the gulf between the two countries for oil exploration and exploitation. Clifford was most solicitous for the large numbers of survivors from vessels sunk by U-boats and at times up to four and five hundred were in the clearing stations.<br>
<br>Clifford was appointed GCMG in 1945 and in the next year his medical advisers told him that he should cease to work in the tropics. In his retirement he loved travelling. He enjoyed being his own builder and electrician and designed and partly built the small house in which he and his wife lived. He was an insatiable reader, his favourite author being Herodotus. In 1964 his autobiography <span class="italic">Proconsul</span> was published. In addition he advised and edited <span class="italic">For my Grandchildren</span> by Princess Alice, countess of Athlone (1966). He was writing a radio play, &#145;Cyrus the Great&#146;, and a history of the Clifford family at the time of his death. He died at Queen Anne Farm, Jacob's Well, Guildford, on 6 October 1969 and was buried in the family vault at Ugbrooke Park, Chudleigh, Devon.<br>
