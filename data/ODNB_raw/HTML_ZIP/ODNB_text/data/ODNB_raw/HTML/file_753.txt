<span class="headword">Ashe,  Thomas</span>  (1770&#150;1835), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, was born at Glasnevin, near Dublin, on 15 July 1770, the third son of Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hickman, of co. Clare and her husband, a half-pay officer who traced his descent from the younger branch of a family whose ancestors accompanied William the Conqueror to England. A cadet of this younger branch served with William of Orange in Ireland, and obtained one of the forfeited Irish estates. Ashe spent his early years at Glasnevin and a county seat of his father's called Asheville, near Limerick, before being sent to a public school in 1783.<br>
<br>Ashe received a commission in the 83rd regiment of foot. The regiment was disbanded shortly afterwards, however, and he was sent to a counting-house at Bordeaux. While there he was briefly imprisoned for wounding in a duel a gentleman, whose sister he had seduced; the wound did not prove fatal, however, and the charges were dropped. Returning to Dublin, he was appointed secretary to the diocesan and endowed schools commission, but, getting into debt, and faced with allegations of embezzlement, he resigned his office and retired to Switzerland.<br>
<br>Ashe then spent several years in foreign travel, living, according to his own account, in a free and unconstrained fashion, and enjoying a somewhat chequered fortune. In America his adventures included editing the <span class="italic">National Intelligencer</span> for a time, arguing with Thomas Jefferson, and sending the first mammoth bones back to Britain. He was also arrested for attempting to steal treasures from churches in Latin America. Back in London, he disputed with Pitt and Cobbett in the newspapers, extracted confidences from Caroline of Brunswick, and had to be bought off to prevent their publication. Besides recording in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> his impressions of the countries he visited, Ashe published separately <span class="italic">Travels in America in 1806</span> (1808), <span class="italic">Memoirs of Mammoth and other Bones Found in the Vicinity of the Ohio</span> (1806), and <span class="italic">A Commercial and Geographical Sketch of Brazil and Madeira</span> (1812). He was also the author of several novels, including <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Book</span> (1811; 4th edn, 1812), <span class="italic">The Liberal Critic, or, Henry Percy</span> (1812), and <span class="italic">The Soldier of Fortune</span> (1816). In his later years Ashe was in rather indigent circumstances. He died at Bath on 17 December 1835.<br>
