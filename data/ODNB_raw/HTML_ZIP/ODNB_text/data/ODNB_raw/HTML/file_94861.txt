</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dacie, Sir  John Vivian</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">haematologist</span>, was born at 30 Montserrat Road, Putney, London, on 20 July 1912, the son of John Charles Dacie (1860&#150;1928), accountant, and an ardent collector of snails and especially shells, and his wife, Lilian Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vivian (1877&#150;1960), a gifted amateur musician. He had three half-sisters through his father's previous marriage, and one sister, Barbara Gertrude (<i>b</i>. 1910), later a schoolteacher. He was educated at King's College School, Wimbledon. His main extra-curricular activities during his schooldays, undoubtedly influenced by his parents, were lepidoptery and music, both of which remained absorbing interests throughout his life. After his father died his mother decided to sell his collection of shells, and two of his conchological colleagues offered to catalogue his collection prior to auction. One of them, Colonel Peele, took an interest in Dacie's future and suggested that he should think of a career in medicine. In 1930 he obtained a leaving exhibition from King's College School, a London county council senior county scholarship, and a scholarship to King's College Hospital. He had a brilliant career as a medical student, winning prizes for anatomy, clinical pathology, surgical pathology, and medicine. He had acquired a microscope and particularly enjoyed staining and examining blood films, building up his personal collection of interesting films. This, together with his continuing enthusiasm for collecting butterflies and moths, gave him the training and skill of a meticulous collector and classifier that would serve him well in his future professional career. After qualifying he held posts in rotation as a house physician, resident biochemist, and resident pathologist. On 8 January 1938 he married Margaret Kathleen Victoria Thynne, a 25-year-old staff nurse at King's College Hospital whom he had met while he was working as a house officer on a medical ward. She was the daughter of Arthur Victor Thynne, minister of religion. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After completing his early clinical training Dacie obtained a Medical Research Council studentship that enabled him to work for six months with Janet Vaughan at the University of London British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital, and then for the next six months with John Wilkinson and Martin Israels at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Then, with a Will Edmonds fellowship, he returned briefly to King's. On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when King's was largely evacuated, he remained in London as blood transfusion officer until January 1940, when he was moved to the Central Pathology Laboratory at Epsom. In 1943 he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving at a casualty clearing station in Normandy six days after D-day, and then in Italy with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In Italy he saw an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> for the position of senior lecturer in clinical pathology at the British Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital, the post that Janet Vaughan had vacated on becoming principal of Somerville College, Oxford. He was appointed to this post in September 1946 and he remained at Hammersmith Hospital for the rest of his career. In 1950 he was appointed reader in haematology by London University, and in 1957 he became the first professor of haematology in the UK. He held this post until his retirement in 1977, when he became an emeritus professor.<br>
<br>Dacie had been attracted to Janet Vaughan's department at Hammersmith by her book <span class="italic">The Anaemias</span>, the second edition of which, published in 1936, included a chapter on haemolytic anaemias. Her tuition was to inspire his life's work on the haemolytic anaemias, complementing his earlier appreciation of blood cell morphology. In 1952 he was awarded the degree of MD by London University for a thesis entitled &#145;Auto-antibodies in acquired haemolytic anaemia in man&#146;. He developed simple diagnostic tests using test tubes and a Pasteur pipette, from which, together with examination of stained blood films, he was able to make astute observations on the behaviour of blood in various haemolytic anaemias. He never felt quite at home with the advent of automatic analysers&#151;not because they were too complex, but because he would not trust a procedure in which blood was put in at one end and a result was printed out at the other. He needed to know exactly how the sample behaved during the process. His simple tests enabled him to detect minor differences in reaction of different blood samples, from which he could recognize variants of haemolysis. By analysing the features that might be present in the blood of a patient, especially blood cell morphology by microscopy, together with critical assessment of the clinical and laboratory data, he could solve the most complex diagnostic problems.<br>
<br>While he was a well-qualified physician, having obtained his membership (1936) and subsequently fellowship (1956) of the Royal College of Physicians, Dacie was not attracted to clinical practice, preferring to study the pathophysiology of blood in the laboratory, though always in close consultation with his more clinically oriented colleagues. He investigated a large number of patients with various haemolytic anaemias who were referred to him from all parts of the UK as well as from overseas, and also reviewed blood films with unusual features sent to him for elucidation. In his office he maintained carefully classified files on all these patients, and contacted them regularly to assess their progress. This enabled him to make careful notes of the clinical course of their illnesses as well as to examine changes in their blood films, which he filed for future reference.<br>
<br>At the same time Dacie was building his department into the leading haematology centre in Britain for all aspects of the speciality. London University had established a one-year postgraduate diploma course in clinical pathology, in which he ran the haematology section; he was also attracting to his department other graduate trainees, initially from the dominions and former British colonies, but also from countries of western Europe and the United States, and from as far afield as China. Thus he greatly influenced the practice of haematology in many other countries besides the UK. He was in great demand to lecture in these countries and to participate in international congresses. Although he enjoyed meeting his old post-doctoral students and trainees, many of whom became distinguished academic and consultant haematologists, he would accept invitations with some reluctance as he preferred to spend his free time at home with his close-knit family&#151;but when he did accept invitations he would at least compensate by including in his luggage his equipment for augmenting his lepidoptera collection.<br>
<br>Dacie had been a member (and later chairman) of a Medical Research Council working party on the treatment of leukaemia. In 1966, at the request of the Department of Health and the Medical Research Council, he established the council's leukaemia unit at Hammersmith, with David Galton as director. This unit became a national (and international) reference centre for research in and diagnosis and management of leukaemias and lymphomas. He helped create the Leukaemia Research Fund and was, from 1975 to 1985, the first chairman of its medical and scientific advisory panel.<br>
<br>During his academic career Dacie published over 170 scientific papers, while a further 670 papers were published independently by other members of his department. He respected their academic freedom and he would not have his name attached to any paper if he had not made a significant contribution and had not been personally involved in its writing. His published papers were later listed in an annotation in the <span class="italic">British Journal of Haematology</span> (2005). He was also the author of two major books, both published by Churchill-Livingstone. The first of these was <span class="italic">Practical Haematology</span>, which was originally published in 1950 and subsequently (with S. M. Lewis as co-author) went into nine editions, becoming a standard textbook worldwide, with translated editions in several languages. The tenth (multi-author) edition, entitled <span class="italic">Dacie and Lewis Practical Haematology</span>, maintained the principles of good laboratory practice that had been established by Dacie; he had an affinity with his technical staff, and in 1953 he was invited to be an honorary fellow of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology. His other major undertaking was <span class="italic">Haemolytic Anaemias</span>. The first edition of this unique treatise appeared in 1954; the third edition was published in five volumes, the first in 1985 and the last in 1999, a <i>magnum opus</i> that was a fitting memorial to his intellect, to the breadth of his scientific and technical knowledge of the subject, and also to his scholarly style of writing. When his retirement had deprived him of his secretary he continued his writing at home in his study, with Margaret in the breakfast-room typing the drafts on their faithful Remington typewriter and pasting in any corrections by hand: as with his attitude to the automated blood counters, he could not bring himself to start using the newfangled computer.<br>
<br>Dacie's influence on haematology was further extended by his distinguished editorship of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Haematology</span>, which was launched by Blackwells in 1955. His dedication and insistence on an impeccable standard of both scientific content and literary style ensured that the journal quickly acquired an international reputation. When he relinquished the editorship in 1962 he remained as chairman of the editorial board, providing valued advice to the next six editors who successively took up the mantle. He was a co-founder of the British Society for Haematology, and became its president in 1964. He was also president of the European&#150;African division of the International Society of Hematology for its congress in London in 1975. Many awards testified to his contributions to British haematology. He was elected FRS in 1967, served as president of the Royal College of Pathologists (1973&#150;5), and of the Royal Society of Medicine (1977), and received honorary degrees from the universities of Uppsala (1961) and Marseilles (1977). He was knighted in 1976.<br>
<br>Dacie's lifelong interest in lepidoptera and his skill and devotion to collection and classification led him to become distinguished in that field too. To this hobby he applied the same scholarly and scientific aptitude as he did with his professional work. He enjoyed inviting selected visitors to inspect his mounted display of various species. He was very proud to have become a member of the British Entomological Society, with three papers published in the <span class="italic">Entomologists' Record</span>. He lived latterly at 10 Alan Road, Wimbledon, and died at St George's Hospital, Tooting, on 12 February 2005, of peritonitis. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and by four of their children: Janet, a diagnostic radiologist at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Julian, a general practitioner, (Mary) Jocelyn, a teacher of children with learning difficulties, and (Adrian) James, a teacher of English. His eldest son, John, who worked in advertising, died of a brain tumour in 1985.<br>
