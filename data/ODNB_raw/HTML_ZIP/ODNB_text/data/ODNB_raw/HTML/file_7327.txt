<span class="headword">Davys,  Mary</span>  (1674&#150;1732), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was almost certainly born in Ireland, where she became the wife of the Revd Peter Davys, master of the free school of St Patrick's, Dublin, and was widowed on 4 November 1698. The couple had two daughters: Ann, who died in 1695, and Mary, who died in the same year as her birth, 1699. Davys emigrated to London in 1700, in Jonathan Swift's words &#145;for mere want&#146;. She wrote <span class="italic">The False Friend, or, The Treacherous Portugueze</span> (published as <span class="italic">The Cousins</span> in her collected works of 1725) and <span class="italic">The Amours of Alcippus and Lucippe</span>, published in 1704, the year she moved to York. Sawbridge published <span class="italic">The Fugitive</span>, an embroidered autobiographical narrative, in 1705&#151;the year he also published Daniel Defoe's <span class="italic">The Storm</span>. <span class="italic">The Fugitive</span> was dedicated to Esther Johnson, the woman best known today as Jonathan Swift's Stella. Publication with two different, second-order publishers suggests the difficulties Davys experienced in establishing herself as a writer in London, and it was not until 1716 that she had another publication: a play, <span class="italic">The Northern Heiress</span>. She moved back to London for its production and by 1718 had earned enough to open a coffee house in Cambridge, where she lived until her death.<br>
<br>York had a lively theatrical culture and was the only provincial theatre to produce its own dramatists. Davys's <span class="italic">The Northern Heiress, or, The Humours of York</span> was performed in 1715 at the Market House there and in London at Lincoln's Inn Fields in April 1716. The play attacks materialistic marriage and has a familiar but audience-pleasing plot in which the heiress Isabella tests her suitors by pretending to lose her fortune. The play benefits from the contemporary delight in ethnic characters, humour, songs, and dances, and some of Davys's characters, such as Lady Greasy and Sir Loobily Joddrel, are still amusing.<br>
<br>It is as a novelist, however, that Davys is remembered. In 1724 her <span class="italic">The Reform'd Coquet</span> was published by subscription and carries the names of John Gay and Alexander Pope, a few London actors, and several friends from Cambridge. This delightful novel about a young, independent, somewhat vain, fashionable young lady and the disguised guardian who tries to protect her is filled with comic scenes, lively adventures, adept satire, and well-drawn, popular character types. This novel, rather than Eliza Haywood's <span class="italic">The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless</span>, is the true paradigm of the central female tradition in the eighteenth-century novel and contains the key character type: &#145;the mistaken heroine who reforms&#146; and learns to appreciate a worthy, if sober, man.<br>
<br>The success of this novel led to the publication of Davys's collected works (1725), which includes eight texts. The previously unpublished ones include: <span class="italic">The Modern Poet</span>, an ironic picture of a poverty-stricken, professionally jealous poet; <span class="italic">The Self-Rival</span>, a play she labelled as &#145;should have been acted&#146; at Drury Lane; and <span class="italic">Familiar Letters betwixt a Gentleman and a Lady</span>. Some critics have called <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span> one of four examples of the highest development of letter fiction before Richardson. In addition to tales of love emphasizing that friendship between a man and a woman should precede marriage, it includes notable political and religious commentary, ranging from gory detail about the Irish uprising to a comic debate between a husband and wife who are fanatically attached to rival political parties. Several pieces are revised, as is <span class="italic">The Merry Wanderer</span>, an expanded and substantially revised <span class="italic">Fugitive</span>, and <span class="italic">The Lady's Tale</span> from her <span class="italic">Amours</span>. Her final original novel, <span class="italic">The Accomplish'd Rake</span> (1727), satirizes the fashionable pastimes of the London leisure class and, implicitly, the plots of contemporary novels more harshly than any of her other work. The novel has a number of unpleasant, debauched characters of both sexes and is blunt about consequences; at one point the narrator says of the protagonist, Sir John Galliard, &#145;His Drinking made him sick, his Gaming made him poor, his Mistresses made him unsound; and his other Faults gave him sometimes, Remorse.&#146; He seduces his best friend's sister, but the brother replaces her with a woman who has venereal disease. In this frank tale, Gaylove repents and proposes to Nancy, whom he has raped, but she makes it clear that her only reason for accepting &#145;an inferior rascal&#146; is her child's well-being.<br>
<br>Davys was one of a group of novelists that included Daniel Defoe, Eliza Haywood, and Penelope Aubin, who set the direction of the development of the English novel; her ability to construct skilful plots may be the strongest of all. Her sense of humour, her Horatian satire, her lively, sometimes deliberately colloquial, dialogue, and her portrayal of middle- and upper-class life feature in all her writings. At the end of her life, perhaps again experiencing financial distress, she published <span class="italic">The False Friend, or, The Treacherous Portugueze</span>; it now appeared under the title she had first given it. In that year, 1732, she described herself as in declining health, including being almost blind and having symptoms of palsy. She gave &pound;5 to St Patrick's in Dublin for a large Oxford <span class="roman">Bible</span> and died a few months later. She was buried on 3 July 1732 at the church of the Holy Sepulchre, her home parish in Cambridge.<br>
