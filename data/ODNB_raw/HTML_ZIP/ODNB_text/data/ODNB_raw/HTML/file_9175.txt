<span class="headword">Farnham,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">self-proclaimed prophet</span>, was a weaver who, together with his fellow weaver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3906/', "John Bull")</script>, established a religious following in London in the late 1630s and early 1640s.<br>
<br>Little is known of Farnham's life before his prophesying brought him to the attention of the authorities. He was described in a 1642 pamphlet as being from Colchester, and there is evidence to confirm both his and Bull's connections with the popular godly there. He was married and had five children, but his wife was dead by 1636, when his eldest child was a little over twelve. As a token of England's sinfulness and, he claimed, to fulfil scriptural prophecy, Farnham later took as his second wife a married woman, Elizabeth Addington. In April 1636 Farnham was arrested at Whitehall by the ecclesiastical authorities. On his arrest he was imprisoned in Newgate, from where he was transferred to the Bethlem Hospital. In 1638 the judges at the trial of Elizabeth Addington for her bigamous marriage recommended that Farnham be set to hard labour in Bridewell. There he would have joined his fellow prophet Bull, though it is uncertain whether the recommendation was ever acted upon. Throughout his successive imprisonments Farnham had petitioned unsuccessfully for his freedom, but, following illness, he was finally granted a measure of liberty. He and Bull then returned into a separatist underground that the events of the early 1640s allowed to flourish more openly. Sensationalist pamphlets claimed that Farnham had attracted a group of female followers; the recently discovered conversion narrative of Rose Thurgood, whose description of herself as a sister to Farnham and Bull suggests common membership of a conventicle, provides evidence of Farnham's spiritual counselling.<br>
<br>Although Farnham has been described as illiterate, his ability to cite freely from the scriptures and to pen appeals to authority reflect a level of literacy often associated with his particular occupation. Farnham's extant petitions, which confirm much of the reports of his beliefs in contemporary pamphlet accounts of his life, make it possible to reconstruct something of his mental world. He and Bull reported themselves to be the two witnesses, predicted in the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, who would come at the end of the world. This provenance, together with his reading of the scriptures in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, structured his prophecies and behaviour. Describing himself as &#145;a Prophet of the most high God&#146;  (English MS 875, fol. 242<i>v</i>), Farnham claimed that he had been anointed with God's sanctifying spirit and that this had given him an ability to find God's truth in the scriptures and to foretell God's judgments on the world. Farnham prophesied that in his lifetime England would experience God's judgments on its wickedness in the form of pestilence, war, and famine. Although he claimed that he would escape unscathed from these judgments of God, he would nevertheless be slain in order to rise again. Farnham's theology, with its central ideas of justifying faith, repentance, remission of sins, and assurance of salvation, drew on Calvinist predestinatory doctrine. In one of several petitions he sent to Charles I, running to eight pages, Farnham boldly expounded the implications of predestination and damnation, identifying persecuting bishops and clerics with the reprobate and himself as one of the elect of the invisible church freed from the curse of the moral law. In an earlier petition, framed as a series of questions and answers, Farnham attacked the idolatrous innovations of the 1630s. Seeking his release, Farnham asserted his loyalty to Charles I, but even here he trod a fine line. While offering a classic restatement of the politics of passive obedience, repeatedly condemning the Scots for taking arms against their king, Farnham reserved to himself the right to pray against a king who persecuted the true prophets of the Lord.<br>
<br>Farnham stood in a long line of chiliastic prophets who used claims of divine inspiration and biblical exegesis to claim a public voice otherwise denied them by their humble social status. His reading of the role of the grace of God in freeing the elect from sin reflected the antinomian and heterodox potential within Calvinism. The post-Reformation mental world was increasingly hostile to claims of divine inspiration and suspicious of its associations with social radicalism. Farnham's predictions would have been enough to attract the attention of the authorities, and in the tense politics of the 1630s, where opponents of the Laudian church interpreted poor weather and pestilence as signs of God's disfavour, his predictions could be seen as a direct threat to the Caroline regime. His confident defence in petitions to Archbishop Laud of the superiority of knowledge derived from the spirit against learning, and his willingness to uphold the claims of &#145;the poor, base and despised ones of the world&#146; against all the bishops and learned men, help to explain why his appeals for release were unsuccessful  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/348/13).<br>
<br>His predictions to the contrary, Farnham contracted plague and died in early January 1642 in Rosemary Lane, London; he was buried on 4 January 1642 at St Mary, Whitechapel. Elizabeth Addington claimed that he (together with Bull who had also died) had risen again and gone to convert the ten tribes of Israel. But Farnham did enjoy a different sort of afterlife. In the religious turmoil of the early 1640s, his history provided good copy for the pamphlet writers. In addition to Thomas Heywood's 1636 printed account, one further pamphlet appeared, <span class="italic">False Prophets Discovered</span>, and as his incorporation in the title of another suggests, Farnham became a symbol of the threat posed by the growth of sectaries in the mid-seventeenth century.<br>
