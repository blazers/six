<span class="headword">Bright,  Henry</span>  (1715&#150;1777), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 21 March 1715 at Brockbury, Worcestershire, the second of the six children of Henry Bright (1692&#150;1726), a landed gentleman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill (1692&#150;1780). Young Henry moved to Bristol, where he was apprenticed to Richard Meyler, a hooper, in 1731. This marked the beginning of a long period of business interaction between the Bright and Meyler families. Bright and Meyler established a West India mercantile business in the late 1730s. Bright was sent as the firm's supercargo to St Kitts and then served as its agent in Jamaica, where he built up a successful trade in sugar, slaves, provisions, and dry goods. After his return to Bristol, on 27 September 1746 he married his partner's daughter, Sarah Meyler (1720&#150;1769), the heir to Ham Green, a fine country house on the Somerset side of the Bristol Avon. They brought up one child.<br>
<br>Bright returned to Jamaica for the period 1748&#150;51, after which he came home for good. During this final spell in the Caribbean he arranged sugar consignments for Meyler and was active in the slave trade, especially the illegal traffic with the Spanish American market. He was the managing agent of twenty-one slave voyages between 1749 and 1766, and was a member of the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa in 1755. With Meyler he continued to run a mercantile house in Jamaica with two branches, one in Kingston, the other in Savanna la Mar.<br>
<br>By the 1760s the Brights and the Meylers went their separate ways in terms of West India trade. Bright, ill with gout, retired in 1775. But he ensured the continuity of his merchant house by putting his son Richard into partnership with his nephew Lowbridge Bright. By the time of the American War of Independence the Brights had established an important provincial trading dynasty: they were known to be men of large fortune, and their merchant house was considered to be in higher credit than any other West India concern in England.<br>
<br>Bright's West India trading was supplemented by other business activities. He was a shipowner and partner in various privateering ventures during the Seven Years' War. In Jamaica he owned land in St Catherine's parish with his brother Francis, took out a mortgage on Cabarita plantation in Westmorland parish, and owned properties in Kingston. He became a member of the Harford Bank, one of the earliest banks established in Bristol.<br>
<br>Bright played an active role in local politics in Bristol. He served on the Bristol common council from 1753 until 1777, being appointed sheriff in 1753 and mayor in 1771. He was an active whig at general elections. In 1767 he became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, the most prestigious mercantile body in Bristol, on payment of a fine. He was a member of the Congregational meeting at Castle Green, Bristol. Although he lived mainly in a town house at 28 Queen Square, one of the most fashionable residences for Bristol merchants, and at Ham Green, he also owned land at Welland Court, Worcestershire, and in Colwall and Coddington parishes, Herefordshire. Bright died at Bristol on 25 November 1777 and was buried at St Nicholas's Church in the city on 29 November. He is reputed to have left a fortune worth &pound;50,000, a substantial amount for a provincial merchant of the time.<br>
