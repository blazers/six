<span class="headword">O'Bryen <span class="st"> [O'Brien]</span>,  James</span>, third marquess of Thomond  (1769&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was second son of Edward O'Bryen (<i>d</i>. March 1801), army captain, and his wife, Mary Carrick. His uncle, Murrough O'Bryen, was first marquess of Thomond. As a captain's servant, O'Bryen entered the navy on 17 April 1783 on the <i>Hebe</i>, stationed in the channel. From 1786 to 1789 he was a midshipman in the frigates <i>Pegasus</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>, both commanded by the duke of Clarence, under whom he also served with the Channel Fleet in the <i>Valiant</i> in 1790. Promoted lieutenant on 19 November 1790, O'Bryen joined, in succession, on the home station, the <i>London</i> (98 guns), the <i>Artois</i> (38 guns), and the <i>Brunswick</i> (74 guns). In the last he was present at Cornwallis's retreat from a greatly superior French force off Brest on 16 and 17 June 1795. On 5 December 1796 he was promoted to command the sloop <i>Childers</i>.<br>
<br>O'Bryen married, on 25 November 1800, Eliza Bridgman (<i>d</i>. 14 Feb 1802), second daughter of James Willyams of Carnanton, Cornwall. From 1800 to 1804 he commanded the <i>Emerald</i> (36 guns), on the West Indian station, where, on 24 June 1803, he captured the <i>Enfant Prodigue</i>, a French schooner of 16 guns, and in the spring of 1804 distinguished himself in forwarding the supplies at the capture of Surinam, as well as by defeating a projected enemy expedition against Antigua. In 1806, while in the West Indies, he married Jane Horsford (<i>d</i>. 8 Sept 1843), daughter of Thomas Ottley, and widow of Valentine Horne Horsford, of Antigua. In February 1808 his uncle, the marquess, died and his brother, William, succeeded to the title. O'Bryen was advanced to the same precedency as if his father had succeeded to the marquessate of Thomond, and he was henceforth known as Lord James O'Bryen. From September 1813 until November 1815 he served in the channel in the <i>Warspite</i> (74 guns). He became rear-admiral in 1825.<br>
<br>On the accession of William IV, O'Bryen was made a lord of the bedchamber, and was made GCH on 13 May 1831. He was made vice-admiral in 1837 and succeeded his brother, William O'Bryen, on 21 August 1846, as the third marquess of Thomond in the Irish peerage. In January 1847, at Bath, he married Anne Fane (<i>d</i>. 22 Oct 1874), daughter of William Flint, sister of Sir Charles William Flint, and widow of Rear-Admiral Fane. He became a full admiral on 13 May 1847, and an admiral of the red in 1853. He died at his home near Bath on 3 July 1855, and was buried in the catacombs of St Saviour's Church, Walcot, Bath, on 10 July. O'Bryen left no children, so the marquessate of Thomond became extinct; of his subsidiary titles the earldom of Inchiquin became extinct but the barony of Inchiquin devolved to a male heir.<br>
