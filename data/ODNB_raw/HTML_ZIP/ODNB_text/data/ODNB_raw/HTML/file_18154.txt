<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1617&#150;1649), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was the most prolific of his profession working in London during the reign of Charles I. Nothing is known about his life apart from what can be deduced from the more than 250 plates he engraved. The catalogue compiled in 1964 by Margery Corbett and Michael Norton shows that the great majority of these were made on commission for members of the London book trade, whether as engraved title-pages or portrait frontispieces. Since many of these books were the first editions of classics of English literature (among them works by John Donne and John Milton), Marshall's fame is assured despite the generally low quality of his work.<br>
<br>Marshall's earliest datable plate is the frontispiece to <span class="italic">A Solemne Joviall Disposition Briefly Shadowing the Law of Drinking</span> by Richard Brathwaite, published in 1617 with its second part, <span class="italic">The Smoaking Age with the Life and Death of Tobacco</span>. This, like the vast majority of Marshall's works, is too crude to reveal with any clarity who might have trained him. But it is more closely related to the style of the recent incomers from the Netherlands, Simon de Passe and Francis Delaram, than it is to the native tradition of Renold Elstrack. The quality of Marshall's plates was always dependent on his model, as can be clearly seen in his title-page to Philemon Holland's 1632 translation of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Cyrupaedia</span>. The portrait of Charles I in it is copied from Willem de Passe and preserves something of the high quality of the original. But the figure of Cyrus, for which no model was available to copy, and which Marshall must have designed himself, is wretched.<br>
<br>Marshall never published any plates himself, and only occasionally was commissioned to make single sheet prints for print publishers (as opposed to plates for the book trade). He seems to have worked for only two print publishers. One was William Riddiard, for whom he made portraits of Charles I and of Thomas Scott. The other was Thomas Jenner, for whom he made three portraits (of Charles II as a baby, Gustavus Adolphus, and the earl of Hamilton) in the 1630s, and two sets of allegorical figures of the four temperaments and the four elements. To these can be added a newly discovered set of emblems which was used for trenchers. A few other plates bear the address of Peter Stent, but most if not all of these were reprints.<br>
<br>Marshall's best-known plate is his frontispiece to the <span class="italic">Eikon basilike: the Pourtraicture of his Sacred Maiestie in his Solitudes and Sufferings</span>. This book, which purports to be written by Charles I himself, appeared within a few days of his execution in January 1649, and became a best-seller despite the efforts of the puritan government to suppress it. So great was the demand that the book was reprinted in various forms fifty-seven times, and the frontispiece had to be re-engraved seven times by Marshall himself, and once by Robert Vaughan copying Marshall's design. Also well known are his illustrations to Francis Quarles's <span class="italic">Emblemes</span> of 1635&#151;a book whose fame is largely dependent on its being, with George Wither's <span class="italic">A Collection of Emblemes</span>, the earliest emblem book published in England. Marshall's last datable plates were produced in 1649, and there is no sign of any later activity; presumably he died late in that year. His prints are not rare, and many are held in the British Museum, London.<br>
