<span class="headword">Asser</span>  (<em>d.</em> 909), <span class="occ">bishop of Sherborne</span>, is a figure whose significance has often been hotly debated. All that is universally accepted about Asser is that a bishop of this name was said by King Alfred to have assisted his translation of Gregory's <span class="italic">Book of Pastoral Rule</span>, and that he held the see of Sherborne when he died. Of eleven reliably recorded witness lists to Edward the Elder's charters, between 900 and 904, Asser <span class="italic">episcopus</span> is in ten, but is absent from transactions dated either 908 or 909. An undated but acceptable document from Wells records his exchange of lands with Edward; the estates he acquired belonged to Wells in 1066. In the name of this otherwise shadowy figure stands a short life of King Alfred. What may have been its sole medieval manuscript was numbered Otho A.xii in the Cotton Library, and was destroyed in the 1731 fire. It had mercifully been copied for Archbishop Parker, who published it in 1574, though unfortunately contaminated with interpolations from the annals of St Neots; more tampering in Camden's 1602 text &#145;proved&#146; Alfred's (re-)foundation of Oxford. Francis Wise published a purified edition in 1722; he apparently did not use the manuscript but, in one of the saga's few happy chances, he did consult Humfrey Wanley about it. Wanley's view, that its script was very like that of a charter dated 1001, confirmed for what this is worth by a &#145;facsimile&#146; of the opening lines supplied by Wise, commands respect. Proof that the life was at least as old as this is its quotation at length in the <span class="italic">Historia regum</span> of Byrhtferth of Ramsey (<i>c</i>.1000) as well as by the annals of St Neots and the twelfth-century chronicler John of Worcester.<br>
<br>The life of Alfred makes its author Welsh. The first of two autobiographical passages has him coming to Alfred from St David's, where he has been &#145;brought up, educated &hellip; and ordained&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, chap. 79). He claims to be a kinsman of &#145;Archbishop&#146; Nobis (perhaps the bishop whose death in 873 is noted by <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>). Nobis and Asser have each been &#145;driven out&#146; by the king of Dyfed. Asser's visit is meant to win the protection of a king whom south Welsh kings have accepted as lord in return for his help against Gwynedd, Mercia, and viking York. Asser is induced to spend at least half of each year with Alfred, who hopes that his people will profit from &#145;St David's learning&#146;. His reward is the gift of two Somerset abbeys and the <i>parochia</i> of Exeter, as well as a silk cloak and (more precious yet) &#145;a strong man's load of incense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, chap. 81). In the second autobiographical section, Asser actually teaches Alfred &#145;to read and translate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Alfred</span>, chap. 87). The king's pursuit of literacy for himself and others, part of a quest for the wisdom of Solomon, is a main theme of the life. The early chapters have the famous story of how the prince wins a book of English poetry from his mother by memorizing it. The conclusion tells how Alfred obliges his judges to learn to read by threatening to dismiss them. In between is an account of a school for royal children and those of both nobles and the less nobly born. All belong to the part of the work (concentrated in its second half) which concerns not the king's life story but (in words quoted from Charlemagne's biographer Einhard) &#145;his behaviour and character&#146;. The narrative proper mostly comprises a translation from the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. Even that has didactic glosses on dynastic politics English and Frankish; suggestively too, the chronicle's &#145;Danes&#146; are regularly &#145;pagans&#146;, where English and even Franks are &#145;Christians&#146;. The book's prose can be clumsy. Present and past tenses are confused. As a work set in 893, when its subject was still alive (in that respect resembling not Einhard but one life of Charlemagne's son Louis the Pious), it may have been a draft intended for completion and smoothing at Alfred's death. Alternatively, it has a literary design which has so far been missed by most scholars; or it was a forgery that <i>pretended</i> to be contemporary, with variable success.<br>
<br>The language and information of the life are, however, compatible with its being what it claims to be&#151;a contemporary account of Alfred's life. The Latin is in the hermeneutic idiom, rare in England since Aldhelm, but perhaps more familiar in Wales. There are also distinct Frankish elements, to go with knowledge of Einhard and nuggets of late Carolingian history. Above all, there are many Welsh symptoms, from an Avon spelled with a &#145;b&#146; to Welsh equivalents offered for a run of English place names (long a staple of Welsh bardic schools). The first, and best, of many reasons to accept the life's authenticity is the fiendish ingenuity required for any such forgery. The life is the sole reason to think Asser Welsh: a forger <i>need</i> not have made his task so difficult. The &#145;blunders&#146; that alert suspicion do not run to a single palpable anachronism. The implication is that it was not from ignorance that it said so little that is plausible on the king's childhood, so much that is rebarbative on his maladies or clockmaking skills. This may be not just a biography but a quasi-hagiographical programme, based on Carolingian mirrors of princes and especially that of the Irish Sedulius Scottus. If so, its importance goes beyond the information it supplies. Asser's book is the main, if not the only, surviving fruit of ninth-century Welsh learning. It may be linked with the ninth-century Welsh manuscripts that made their way to tenth-century England. Such influences would help to explain the flowering of the English hermeneutic tradition from <i>c</i>.930. Second, the root of disbelief in Asser is distaste for the Alfred he depicts. But Asser's Alfred is our Alfred, like it or not. His book, addressed to the king in person, is not to be marginalized as Welsh verbosity. If it is odd, its subject was odd enough to prompt it. Their combined oddity may underlie the book's very lack of circulation. The life is thus not merely authentic: it is another extraordinary outcome of the extraordinary atmosphere created by Alfred.<br>
