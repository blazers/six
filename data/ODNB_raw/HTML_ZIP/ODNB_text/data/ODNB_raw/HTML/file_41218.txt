<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petermann,  August Heinrich</span>  (1822&#150;1878), <span class="occ">geographer and cartographer</span>, was born in April 1822 (probably on the 1st) in Bleicherode am Eichsfelde, Prussia, the second of six children born to Katherine Henrietta and August Rudolf Petermann. He attended elementary school in Bleicherode and, from 1836 to 1839, the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Nordhausen. Maps drawn during his school days survive, and it was a map of South America that won him admittance to Heinrich Berghaus's Geographische Kunstschule in Potsdam in 1839, the year of its foundation, after plans that he should enter the church had been abandoned. Fees at the school were waived because of his parents' poverty. Clearly the most gifted student in the school, Petermann was employed on several important projects, notably Alexander von Humboldt's <span class="italic">Asie centrale</span> (1843), which contained the first map to be published as Petermann's independent work, and the <span class="italic">Physikalischer Atlas</span> (1838&#150;48), the first thematic atlas of the world. The work met with acclaim and, when Alexander Keith Johnston was granted leave to produce an English version of it, Petermann moved to Johnston's cartographical institute in Edinburgh in 1845 to work on it and other atlases. In 1847 Petermann moved to London where, from his cartographic institute at 5 Carrington Street and later 9 Charing Cross, he produced maps for scholarly journals, newspapers, and other publications, sometimes in collaboration with Ernst Ravenstein and John Bartholomew, the younger. His map of 1852 showing the progress of the cholera epidemics of the 1830s is a remarkable early medical map with perceptive &#145;statistical notes&#146;.<br>
<br>Petermann became interested in geographical discovery: in 1846 he was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and in 1849 became a corresponding member of the Berlin Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Erdkunde with the support of Karl Ritter. As a result of his influence the German scientists Heinrich Barth and Adolf Overweg were invited to join James Richardson's expedition to central Africa in 1849, and Petermann published English and later German accounts of the expedition. He also made knowledgeable contributions (for example, on polar routes influenced by the Gulf Stream) to the debate about the fate of Sir John Franklin. Petermann was active as a lecturer on geographical topics to the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association. In 1852 he was granted the title &#145;physical geographer and engraver on stone in ordinary to the queen&#146; and his maps were held in high regard in Britain. However, economic difficulties and personal differences with his English colleagues led him to renounce his intention of settling permanently in England.<br>
<br>In 1854 Petermann returned to Germany to Justus Pertes's publishing house in Gotha, which was being reshaped as a geographical institute under the influence of Wilhelm and Bernhardt Pertes; the status of professor was conferred on him by Ernst XI of Saxe-Gotha. From Gotha in 1855 he founded <span class="italic">Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen</span>&#151;an important journal still continuing in the late twentieth century&#151;the contents of which reflected Petermann's cartographic skills, and his interest in both scientific geography and exploration. His work in encouraging exploration in Africa and the polar regions, cartographic innovations, and geographical education in universities and among the general public led in 1868 to his being awarded the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society, then the highest accolade for a geographer. His personal life was less happy than his professional. His first marriage in 1856 to Clara Mildred Leslie, with whom he had three children, was dissolved in 1877, and his second marriage, to Tony Pfister in 1878, lasted only four months before his death, by suicide, on 25 September 1878 in Gotha.<br>
<br>Petermann's maps were remarkable technically (for example, in their use of a modified lithography and of new projections), aesthetically (for example, in their use of colour), and intellectually (for example, in his development of thematic maps, which promoted understanding of phenomena by showing their distribution). His writings reflected the scientific nature of German geography and combined detailed observations and imaginative hypotheses. Through his pupils, who dominated the next generation of German cartographers, and his <span class="italic">Mitteilungen</span> he continued to influence geography, exploration, and cartography long after his death.<br>
