<span class="headword">Bennet,  Henry Grey</span>  (1777&#150;1836), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 December 1777, the second of three sons and fourth of eight children of Charles Bennet, fourth earl of Tankerville (1743&#150;1822), of Chillingham Castle, Northumberland, and his wife, Emma (1752&#150;1836), daughter and coheir of the London banker Sir James Colebrooke, first baronet, of Gatton, Surrey. He was educated at Eton College (1788&#150;92), served five years in the 1st foot guards, and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1798, and Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1799 before graduating MA in 1801. Between interludes as assistant to William Drummond, envoy at Naples, and captain of militia volunteers, he was called to the bar in 1803, and afterwards practised on the western circuit. The political diarist Thomas Creevey described him in 1805 as &#145;most amiable, occasionally most <i>boring</i>, but at all times most upright and honourable&#146;  (Maxwell, 1.36).<br>
<br>Bennet, whose father had retreated from public life after two spells as postmaster-general, shared the political ambitions of his brother Charles Augustus Bennet (1776&#150;1854): both belonged to the whiggish Brooks's Club. Bennet's first election as MP for Shrewsbury in 1806 was invalidated, not before he had signalled hostility to George III's dismissal of the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;. His advocacy of Catholic emancipation courted defeat in 1807. Before regaining his seat in 1811 he travelled to Spain to view the theatre of the Peninsular War. He faced no contest for his parliamentary seat after 1812. In the Commons he joined the opposition &#145;mountain&#146; led by Samuel Whitbread, whom he revered, although his closest associates were his fellow lawyers Creevey and Henry Brougham. His maiden speech, ostensibly a conventional attack on placemen, was directed at the prince regent, who, provoked by Bennet's championship of his estranged wife, labelled him &#145;factious&#146;  (Aspinall, 134). Bennet shunned the &#145;constitutional&#146; opposition leaders as deviants from Foxite principles, but his <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> was Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, leader of the house, with the home secretary Henry Addington, first Viscount Sidmouth, a close second. His quest for &#145;a cheap government under a reformed parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 7, 1822, 1313) meant frequent tirades against army estimates, civil list extravagance, and taxes. He assailed other reactionary regimes sanctified by Napoleon's final defeat, before which he toured the continent. He condemned post-war curtailment of civil liberties, and support for parliamentary reform involved him in metropolitan politics, but he disappointed whigs and radicals alike. After the Peterloo massacre of August 1819 he sought an inquiry into the manufacturing districts' plight. His outspoken defence of Queen Caroline in 1820&#150;21 led to his portrayal among her champions in an engraving by Francis Holl after Abraham Wivell. The radical <span class="italic">Black Book</span> (1823) commended him:<blockquote>Always at his post. Supports Mr [Joseph] Hume nobly. Tells the Collective Wisdom home truths. Calls for useful papers and documents. Shames the rogues &hellip; Great &hellip; as the labours of Mr Hume have been, it may be doubted whether all his exertions can be put in competition with the single act of Mr Bennet in obtaining an accurate return of the salaries, offices and emoluments of the honourable Members. (J. Wade, 2.139)</blockquote>Bennet's efforts &#145;to diminish the sum of human misery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 39, 1819, 118), adorn the history of English criminal law. No retributory institution, prison, hulk, penal colony, or penitentiary adequately combined punishment with reformation: he and his select committees exposed them, but to little avail. The inquiry into metropolitan policing which he initiated, prompted by Sir Samuel Romilly, caused such a furore in 1816 that ten years elapsed before constructive legislation emerged, although Bennet, having previously piloted the abolition of gaol fees, overthrew statutory rewards for informers on felony in 1818. Other abuses that he confronted included flogging, callous capital punishments, confusion of political prisoners with felons, the despotism of colonial governors, the plight of lunatics and child chimney sweeps, and corrupt licensing. He was sometimes taken in by unscrupulous petitioners.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1816 Bennet married Gertrude Frances (<i>d</i>. 23 Jan 1841), daughter of Lord William Russell. They had one son and three daughters. The abrupt termination of his public career, ascribed to the death from consumption of his only son six months after that of one of his daughters, in 1824, was followed by a curative continental trip in the spring of 1825. His public reputation at home was ruined by the threat, albeit averted, of criminal prosecution for importuning a young male servant at Spa in August 1825. This accounts for his remaining in exile, and giving up his seat in parliament the following year. He and his wife resided in a villa near Lake Como in Italy until his death on 29 May 1836. Bennet's disgrace explains his subsequent pathetic submission to criticism of his parliamentary endeavours, themselves often misreported. The author of several pamphlets, and a fellow of the Royal Society, Bennet kept a political diary from 1806, now lost, though extracts were published in the nineteenth century and one volume (for 1821) has come to light.<br>
