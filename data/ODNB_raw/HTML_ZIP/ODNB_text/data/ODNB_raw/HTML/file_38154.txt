<span class="headword">Wren,  Percival Christopher</span>  (1875&#150;1941), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 1 November 1875 at 37 Warwick Street, Deptford, London, the son of John Wilkins Wren (1847&#150;1907/8), schoolmaster, and his first wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lasbury (1845/6&#150;1887). Reliable reference works such as <span class="italic">The Oxford Companion to English Literature</span> state that he was born in 1885 in Devon. In this they have been deliberately misled. In other contexts Wren is described as a sailor, an explorer, a trooper in a British cavalry regiment, and a recruit to the French Foreign Legion. There appears to be no credible evidence for any of these suggestions. He married Alice Lucie Shov&eacute;lier, formerly Alice Lucy Shoveler (<i>b</i>. 1870), daughter of Crispin Shoveler, on 23 December 1899. At this time he was still signing himself as Percy, but at some stage he changed his name to Percival, and was later known as Christopher.<br>
<br>There appears to be no reliable evidence to explain Wren's motives for falsifying his past, but by adding his assumed middle name he perhaps hoped to indicate a genealogical relationship to Sir Christopher Wren (1632&#150;1723); or he may simply have enjoyed hoodwinking the public about his background. Whatever his reasons, when Wren applied to join the Indian educational service (IES), to which he was appointed in 1903, he was forced to reveal his real date and place of birth; he also gave the information that he was educated at West Kent School, studied as a non-collegiate student at Oxford, and graduated BA in 1898. From then until 1903 he worked as a schoolmaster. From 1903 to 1910 he was headmaster of Karachi high school, and in 1904&#150;6 he was also educational inspector for Sind. In 1910 he became assistant to the director of public instruction in Bombay, and after a period of war service, from December 1914 to October 1915, he took up his last post in the IES as principal of Elphinstone high school, Bombay; he retired in November 1917.<br>
<br>Wren did not limit his activities to teaching. Between 1910 and 1912 he published four textbooks, including one on teaching English, one as a guide to the theory and practice of education, and one entitled <span class="italic">Indian School Organization</span> (1911). These books reveal at least one aspect of his character: he was not lacking in self-assurance. For instance, in the preface to <span class="italic">Indian School Organization</span> he explained: &#145;It is hoped that this book may be found useful &hellip; by teachers in general and headmasters in particular and may prove suggestive to Indian educationalists whose experience happens to be less varied than that of the author&#146;. During the First World War Wren suffered a period of ill health. His war service as a captain in the Indian army reserve of officers, infantry branch, was interrupted by sick leave from February to October 1915; and in Bombay in 1917 he had another period of nine months' sick leave before retiring from the IES.<br>
<br>Wren's first novel, <span class="italic">Dew and Mildew</span>, set in India, was published in 1912. Between that year and 1941, the year of his death, he published over thirty more novels. The most popular were those with a setting based on the French Foreign Legion, the earliest of which, <span class="italic">The Wages of Virtue</span>, appeared in 1916, and his most notable success, <span class="italic">Beau Geste</span>, in 1924. The latter was filmed three times, in 1926, 1939, and 1966, and was televised by the BBC in 1984. It was remarkable for its clever opening. While travelling from Kano to Lagos, an officer of the French army recounts to a British member of the Nigerian civil service the mysterious circumstances in which, going to the relief of a desert fort, manned by legionnaires, surrounded by rebel Tuaregs, he reaches his objective only to find no sign of a battle or siege, but a fort defended by corpses.<br>
<br>Two other of Wren's novels were filmed: <span class="italic">Beau Sabreur</span> (1926) in 1928 and <span class="italic">Beau Ideal</span> (1928) in 1931. Wren's last novel, <span class="italic">Odd&#151;but even so</span>, was published in 1941. He died at Moor Court, Amberley, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 22 November 1941. He was survived by his wife, Isabel, who was probably his second wife, and a stepson, R. A. Graham-Smith, of Marbleton rectory, Heathfield, Sussex; with his first wife, Alice, he had had at least one child, Estelle Lenore (1901&#150;1910).<br>
