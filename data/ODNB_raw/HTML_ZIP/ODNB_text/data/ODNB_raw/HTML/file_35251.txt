<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norman, Sir  Henry Wylie</span>  (1826&#150;1904), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 2 December 1826 in London, only son of James Norman, a businessman who had been at sea and at Havana, and Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wylie, of Dumfries. His father subsequently moved to Calcutta, where he died in 1853; his mother died at Sandgate, near Folkestone, on 13 September 1902.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>While his parents were overseas Norman was educated indifferently at three private schools in England, under the supervision of his maternal grandparents. He joined his father in Calcutta in 1842, where he worked as a clerk for eighteen months. In March 1844 he received a direct appointment to the Bengal army and joined the 1st Bengal native infantry as ensign in April 1844, transferring in March 1845 to the 31st Bengal native infantry. He served with his regiment in the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1846, becoming adjutant in 1847 and serving through the Second Anglo-Sikh War, being present at Ramnagar, Sadulapur, Chilianwala, and the final victory at Gujrat in February 1849. In 1849 he became brigade major to Sir Colin Campbell at Peshawar. He had already begun to create a reputation as an able, immensely hardworking staff officer, with a prodigious memory and a natural aptitude for work. He served in the 1850 Kohat Pass expedition under Sir Charles Napier and in expeditions against the Afridis, the Mohmands, and the Utman Khel, and was mentioned in dispatches in April 1852. He was made deputy assistant adjutant-general and aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Abraham Roberts, commanding the Peshawar division, in 1853, where he became friendly with Sir Abraham's son, Frederick. Also in 1853 he married Selina Eliza Davidson, daughter of Dr Alexander Davidson, inspector of hospitals in India, and they had four daughters and a son, Henry Alexander, who died in 1858. In 1855 he rejoined his regiment in the suppression of the Santal uprising in Bihar, moving in May 1856 to the post of assistant adjutant-general at army headquarters in Calcutta and Simla.<h2>
<a name="Serviceinthemutiny"></a>Service in the mutiny</h2>Norman was at Simla in May 1857 when news arrived of the Meerut mutiny and the mutineers' occupation of Delhi. Norman accompanied the force assembled for the siege of Delhi as assistant adjutant-general and became acting adjutant-general when Colonel Chester was killed at the battle of Badli-ki-sarai on 8 June 1857. He served throughout the siege and the recapture of the city at the end of September 1857, being superseded as adjutant-general to the force by Neville Chamberlain in June, but standing in again when Chamberlain was severely wounded in July 1857. He left Delhi with Greathead's column five days after the city fell and took part in the actions at Bulandshahr, Aligarh, and Agra before joining the new commander-in-chief, Colin Campbell, for the second relief of Lucknow, as deputy adjutant-general to the force. He took a direct part in the fighting at the Shah Najafmosque in November 1857, having his horse shot underneath him. He was present at the final capture of Lucknow in March 1858, and subsequently in the operations in Rohilkhand and the battle of Bareilly on 5 May, where he was wounded, and finally in the operations in Oudh in the winter of 1858&#150;9. When the mutiny ended he had been mentioned in dispatches or general orders twenty-three times. He published <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Campaign of the Delhi Army</span> (1858), and subsequently pamphlets and articles in reviews.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Norman received a CB in August 1859 and was appointed to the new Bengal staff corps (which he had largely designed) in December 1860, when he also received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy. The mutiny had consolidated his reputation as one of the most able staff officers in India.<br>
<br>In October 1860, after leave in England, Norman was appointed assistant military secretary to the commander-in-chief of the British army, the duke of Cambridge, a post which was effectively the link between the commander-in-chief and the authorities in India on all matters of personnel appointments. It was a post of high influence and responsibility, in view of the duke's keen interest in Indian army matters, and required tact and discretion. He held that post only until 1861, when he was sent back to India as secretary to the government in the military department to assist in the massive task of post-mutiny reorganization. It was a tribute to his abilities but also effectively the end of active soldiering, the rest of his career being in administrative posts.<br>
<br>As a key figure in the reorganization, Norman attracted the wrath of the many vested interests affected, but he was rewarded by being made aide-de-camp to the queen in September 1863. His wife had died on 3 October 1862, and in September 1864 he married Jemima Anne (Minnie) Temple, the daughter of T. Knowles and widow of Captain A. B. Temple, but she died in 1865 at sea, <i>en route</i> with her husband for leave in England. Throughout 1866 Norman was on sick leave in England, following a prolonged bout of fever, but he resumed his post in India in 1867 and was promoted major-general in March 1869. In March 1870 he married Alice Claudine Sandys, the daughter of Teignmouth Sandys, a Bengal civil servant. They had two sons and a daughter, and she survived her husband.<br>
<br>In June 1870 Norman was promoted to the post of military member on the governor-general's council and head of the military department. He was a prominent supporter of the policy of &#145;masterly inactivity&#146; associated with the governor-generalships of Lord Mayo and Lord Northbrook, of friendly relations with Russia, non-interference in Afghanistan, and retrenchment and reform in India. He was made a KCB in May 1873, but with the arrival of Lord Lytton as governor-general in 1876 Norman's views became out of tune with the &#145;forward policy&#146; espoused by Lytton, Colley, Roberts, and others, and he resigned in March 1877, becoming a lieutenant-general shortly afterwards. In 1878 he joined the secretary of state for India's Council of India in London, playing a major part in the decision in 1881 to withdraw from Kandahar at the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Norman's military career was over, his lack of recent service and command experience militating against him. He was promoted full general by seniority on 1 April 1882. Later that year he was employed in settling financial questions arising from the Indian contingent in Wolseley's Egyptian expedition. In November 1883 he resigned from the Council of India on taking up the governorship of Jamaica. He arrived to face a constitutional crisis over non-official representation on the governor's council. He brought with him new proposals which through his tact and discretion he succeeded in introducing without uproar, thus defusing the issue. By the time his tenure ended, he had become respected and popular. His reward was the GCMG and a military GCB in 1887.<br>
<br>In 1889 Norman became governor of Queensland, succeeding Anthony Musgrave after Sir Henry Blake's nomination proved unacceptable there because of his Irish connections. Norman faced constitutional problems and financial difficulties. He defused the situation in his usual tactful and wise way, characteristically offering to accept a reduction in his own pay to assist in the financial crisis. He travelled much, was public-spirited and supported colonial rights, and was generally liked and respected. On issues such as the partition of Queensland and Australian federation he was cautious, but he was keenly in favour of the principle of imperial defence, although unable to do much because of Queensland's financial difficulties. His successful governorship ended in 1895, and he left Queensland in November for London, where he acted for a year as agent-general for the colony.<br>
<br>In September 1893 Norman had been offered, and initially accepted, the governor-generalship of India, the highest post in the empire. It was a great tribute to his abilities and reputation, but within a few days he realized that the strain of such an arduous office would be too much for him at the age of nearly sixty-seven, and he withdrew; Lord Elgin was subsequently appointed.<br>
<br>In 1896 Norman was appointed chairman of the royal commission on the economic conditions of the sugar-growing colonies in the West Indies. It enabled him to indulge his lifelong recreation of cruising, but his views on sugar duties were not shared by his fellow commissioners.<br>
<br>In 1901 Norman accepted the pleasant post of governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and was raised to field marshal in June 1902. He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Royal Colonial Institute, and director of the Commercial Union Assurance Company. His last public service was as a member of the royal commission on the war in South Africa. His health was already failing and he died at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, on 26 October 1904, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery, London. Memorial tablets were installed at the Royal Hospital, in Calcutta, and in the crypt of St Paul's.<h2>
<a name="Characterandappearance"></a>Character and appearance</h2>Norman was slightly below medium height and slender. During the mutiny he had shown his personal courage, presence of mind, and coolness, and there is no reason to suppose that he could not have gone on to be a successful commander; but it was as a staff officer and administrator that he excelled&#151;lucid, penetrating, immensely industrious, holding his views firmly, but always modest, friendly, and tactful. He did not possess the charisma of a Roberts but he was the quiet man to whom others instinctively turned for wise counsel and to whom difficult problems could be presented with the expectation that they would be handled sensibly and without fuss&#151;the epitome of &#145;a safe pair of hands&#146;.<br>
