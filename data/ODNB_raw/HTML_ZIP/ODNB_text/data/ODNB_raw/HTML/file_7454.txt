<span class="headword">Delaval,  Edward Hussey</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, was baptized at Newburn, Northumberland, on 12 June 1729, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76465/', "Francis Blake Delaval (bap. 1692, d. 1752)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73888/', "Delaval family")</script>], landowner of Seaton Delaval and Ford Castle, Northumberland, and of Doddington, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Rhoda (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter of Robert Apreece of Washingley, Huntingdonshire. He was admitted a fellow-commoner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1747; he graduated BA in 1750 and MA in 1754, and was elected a fellow in 1755. When his eldest brother, Sir Francis Blake Delaval, died in 1771, his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39337/', "John Hussey Delaval (1728&#150;1808)")</script>, succeeded to the Northumberland estates; he was made Baron Delaval of Seaton Delaval in 1786. When the latter died childless in 1808 the barony was extinguished, and Edward Delaval succeeded to the entailed estates at Seaton Delaval, having already inherited Doddington in 1774. On 22 December 1808 he married Sarah, daughter of George Scott of Methley, Yorkshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>Delaval was an accomplished musician and classicist, with a knowledge of French, German, and Italian. At Cambridge, under the influence of John Mickleburgh, professor of chemistry, he became interested in Newtonian natural philosophy and in the experimental ramifications of Newton's work in chemistry, electricity, and optics. His family patronized the portrait painter and electrician Benjamin Wilson, and in 1759 Delaval supported Wilson's theory of two electric fluids with some ingenious experiments on conductivity, which were published in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>  (51, 1759, 83&#150;8; 52, 1761, 353&#150;6). This led to a dispute with John Canton, who supported a one fluid theory. Delaval was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 December 1759 (his certificate was signed by Wilson and Benjamin Franklin), and in 1764 he contributed an illustrated account of the effects of lightning on St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. In 1769 he was appointed with Franklin, Wilson, and William Watson to report to the society on the means of securing St Paul's against danger from lightning. When the cathedral was struck by lightning on 22 March 1772, Delaval gave an account of the damage. In the subsequent controversy between Franklin and Wilson on the merits of pointed or blunt lightning conductors to protect the powder works at Purfleet, Delaval sided with Wilson.<br>
<br>Following up Newton's <span class="italic">Opticks</span> (3rd edn, 1721), Delaval experimented on the specific gravities of gold, lead, silver, copper, and iron and their colours when united to glass or in solutions; for his paper on the subject, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1765, he received the Royal Society's Copley medal. He believed that the &#145;bigness&#146; (size) of the ultimate particles of metals might be deduced from their colours. He developed the subject in <span class="italic">An Experimental Inquiry into the Cause of the Changes of Colours in Opake and Coloured Bodies</span> (1777), the first fifty pages of which had been printed &#145;some years ago&#146;  (p. 55) and translated into French in 1774. A complete French translation was made by the dyer Quatrem&egrave;re Dijonval in 1778, and an Italian version appeared in 1779. Delaval's classical scholarship was revealed in a long historical preface on the dyeing and textile technologies of the ancients, his argument being that since a practical skill in dyeing depended upon the separation of matter into its smallest parts, the ancients were aware of the atomic nature of matter. The treatise was packed with interesting experiments on the colours of plant extracts, animal materials, and minerals, and Delaval suggested that the sky is blue because blue is the most refrangible colour and air is more minutely divided than any other medium  (p. 92). In 1785 he was awarded the gold medal of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society for <span class="italic">An Experimental Inquiry into the Cause of the Permanent Colours of Opake Bodies</span>, which detailed his investigations of reflected and transmitted light. Implicit in all of his work on colours was a corpuscular theory of light; he also adhered to the phlogiston theory of chemical composition. Although he lived through the chemical revolution he published nothing after 1785; before then his writings were well known on the continent, and he was a member of the royal societies of G&ouml;ttingen and Uppsala, and of the Institute of Bologna.<br>
<br>Among Delaval's minor achievements was the manufacture, under his direction, of an elaborate set of musical glasses. These inspired Franklin to design the armonica in 1761. Delaval also made artificial gems, and devised a method of extracting fluor (calcium fluoride) from glass, of which he left various coloured samples. His Gothic-styled house in Parliament Place, Westminster, London, was fireproofed with artificial stones made under his direction. He died in Parliament Place on 14 August 1814, and was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey. His estates were inherited by a nephew, Sir Jacob Henry Astley, MP for Norfolk.<br>
