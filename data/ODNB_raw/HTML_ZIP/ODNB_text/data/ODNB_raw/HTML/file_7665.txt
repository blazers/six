<span class="headword">Dillon,  Thomas</span>, fourth Viscount Dillon  (1614/15&#150;1673<span class="mult">x</span>5), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the second son of Sir Christopher Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1624), Irish administrator, and Lady Jane, daughter of James Dillon, first earl of Roscommon. His father, of Ballylagham, co. Mayo, was president of Connaught. Thomas converted from Roman Catholicism to protestantism at the age of fifteen when he succeeded his nephew as Viscount Dillon in May 1630. Before 1636 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1674), daughter of Sir Nicholas White of Leixlip and Ursula, daughter of Garret, first Viscount Moore of Drogheda. Frances brought him a portion of &pound;3000; the couple had seven sons.<br>
<br>In November 1640 the Irish House of Lords appointed Dillon as one of four delegates to Charles I. While in England and Scotland during the autumn of 1641 he may also have acted as an intermediary in a plan to bring an Irish army to Charles's assistance against the Scottish covenanters. This allegation rests primarily on a contemporaneous Scottish pamphlet of 1643 and the fact that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7656/', "Sir James Dillon")</script>, his uncle, one of the colonels licensed to recruit from Strafford's disbanded Irish army, became tangentially involved in a plot to seize Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>On his return from Edinburgh in October 1641 Dillon was appointed to the Irish council and made governor of Roscommon. He was part of a moderate party that tried unavailingly to keep the Irish parliament in session and to defuse the recent rebellion. He left for England in late November 1641 on a secret mission to Charles I on behalf of the Catholic lords. Arrested by the English parliament, he and his brother-in-law Theobald, Viscount Taaffe, made their escape after four months, joined the emergent royalist party, and fought in the early part of the first civil war.<br>
<br>Dillon returned to Ireland after the cessation of hostilities in September 1643 &#145;to sit quiet tippling, gaming and working division and rent in his majesties subjects&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.76), according to a jaundiced confederate Catholic source. He was appointed governor of Athlone town and castle in February 1643 and joint president of Connaught in 1644. He accompanied Ormond, the king's lord lieutenant in Ireland, in August 1646 when he marched on Kilkenny and Cashel, in order to secure support for a treaty between the confederate Catholics and Charles I. When Ormond was forced to turn back, Dillon fled to Connaught. Meanwhile, in September 1643, his uncles George Dillon, a Franciscan friar, and Sir James Dillon, by then a colonel in the Leinster confederate Catholic army, captured Athlone Castle by a ruse. According to the hostile author of the <span class="italic">Aphorismical Discovery</span> Dillon's subsequent public conversion to Roman Catholicism on 6 December 1646 was a gambit to secure the aid of Rinuccini, the papal nuncio, in regaining possession of Athlone Castle. Following his conversion and pledge of loyalty to the confederate Catholic cause, the confederate supreme council ordered that Athlone Castle be restored to him. However, the occupant defied the order and, early in the following year, Dillon rejoined Ormond. When the latter subsequently surrendered Dublin to parliament, Dillon joined the Leinster confederate Catholic army and led the cavalry contingent at the catastrophic defeat of Dungan's Hill in August 1647. Dillon personally commanded the reserve, which fled in the opening stages of the battle, &#145;never giving the least notice of such a base cowardly act&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.156). Following the split in the confederate Catholics between clericalist and Ormondist factions Dillon fought for the latter and was captured in an ambush but escaped soon afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1649 Ormond returned to Ireland and secured a definitive alliance between the confederate Catholics and the royalist party. In July that year Dillon was reinstated as governor of Athlone. During the royalist siege of Dublin Dillon was left with a force of 2500 men to cut off the northern approaches while the bulk of the army encamped at Rathmines to the south of the city. On 2 August a surprise attack overran Ormond's camp; at some point in the battle Ormond sent a message ordering Dillon to march south and attack the rear of the parliamentary army. Dillon refused, probably because it seemed to him that it was too late to prevent a rout.<br>
<br>In 1650 Dillon was tasked with the command of royalist forces in Offaly. In March that year Kilkenny was threatened by parliamentary thrusts from the south under Cromwell and from Dublin. Dillon's failure to hinder the thrust from Dublin was &#145;astonishing&#146;  (Wheeler, 13), and he refused Lord Castlehaven's appeal to help save Kilkenny from capture. In August 1650 he tricked Henry Ireton (who had replaced Cromwell as parliamentary commander-in-chief in Ireland) into believing that he would surrender Athlone in exchange for money and an assurance of personal safety, thereby causing Ireton to waste a crucial fortnight waiting for the expected betrayal. On the other hand, the following year in June he surrendered the castle without a fight because, he said, &#145;he desired to submit to the government of England, as being of English descent and extract&#146;  (Murtagh, 106). Charles Coote, parliamentary president of Connaught, received the surrender, promising to &#145;mediate with the parliament&#146;, for a pardon and a &#145;competency of land&#146;  (ibid.) for the support of Dillon's family but nothing came of this promise. Dillon retired to Hare Island on Lough Ree where he lived in relative poverty. In 1651 his wife was implicated in a failed attempt to recapture Athlone; this told against Dillon when he unsuccessfully sought relief from the government in 1652. Later petitions suggest that he may then have travelled abroad.<br>
<br>Dillon's estates were confiscated by the protectorate but he recovered them following the Restoration. In 1661 he was one of those who stood bail for the marquess of Antrim, to whom he was related by marriage and who was then in the Tower on a charge of treason. In 1663 he signed the remonstrance of Irish Catholic nobles and gentry professing their loyalty in the hope of some measure of toleration of their religion. He died between 23 May 1673 when he wrote his will and 1675 when the will was proved in Ireland. His wife died on 20 December 1674.<br>
