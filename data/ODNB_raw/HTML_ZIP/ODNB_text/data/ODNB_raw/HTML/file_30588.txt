</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barker, Sir  Ernest</span>  (1874&#150;1960), <span class="occ">political theorist</span>, was born on 23 September 1874 at Heald Cottage, Woodley, Cheshire, the eldest of the seven children of George Barker, a miner turned farm labourer, and his wife, Elizabeth Pollitt. The family home was a small cottage on the farm of his maternal grandparents close to the Cheshire&#150;Derbyshire border. He owed his academic success first and foremost to his mother, who was determined that her eldest child should become a scholar. But at the village school he was fortunate also in serving as a &#145;pacemaker&#146; for the son of a local businessman who was working for a scholarship to the Manchester grammar school. In the event, Barker won the scholarship and began ascending one of few educational ladders to Oxford then available (first as classical scholar at Balliol in 1893, then as a Craven scholar in 1895, and as Jenkyns exhibitioner in 1897).<br>
<br>The firm, classical basis of Barker's education that had been laid at Manchester grammar school was well sustained at Oxford. But following firsts in classical moderations (1895) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (&#145;Greats&#146;) (1897), and undecided about his future, he read for the school of modern history. Under the guidance of the master of Balliol, A. L. Smith, he secured a first in 1898. Abandoning tentative thoughts of entering the civil service, Barker embarked upon a career of teaching and scholarship in which classics and history were never clearly demarcated. He combined a seven-year prize fellowship at Merton College, Oxford, from 1898 to 1905 with a lectureship in modern history at Wadham College from 1899 to 1909 and a tutorship for the non-collegiate students from 1899 to 1913. Although he was subsequently elected to fellowships in modern history at other Oxford colleges&#151;St John's (1909&#150;13) and New College (1913&#150;20)&#151;his classical learning continued to stimulate other scholarly interests. In this he was not untypical of contemporary Oxford dons. Indeed&#151;as Barker himself commented in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Age and Youth</span>&#151;&#145;Greats&#146; constituted &#145;something of a <i>lingua franca</i> and a common <i>esprit de corps</i>&#146; across the different faculties  (Barker, 17).<br>
<br>During this formative period of his life Barker married on 26 July 1900 Emily Isabel Salkeld (<i>d</i>. 1924), sister of a friend from Manchester grammar school and daughter of Richard Salkeld, the vicar of St Mark's, Dukinfield; there were two daughters and one son. The latter, Arthur Ernest Barker (1901&#150;1989), was a foreign correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> until joining the BBC in 1938. Barker's elder daughter, Margaret, married the painter John Mansbridge, son of the adult education pioneer Albert Mansbridge; his younger daughter, Elisabeth Barker (1910&#150;1986), was a diplomatic correspondent for Reuters and writer on eastern European affairs. A research fund administered by the British Academy commemorates her achievements.<h2>
<a name="Developmentofhispoliticalthought"></a>Development of his political thought</h2>Barker used ancient Greece as a sounding-board for his ideals of, and beliefs about, the modern world in his first book, <span class="italic">The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle</span> (1906). This work analysed the writings of Plato and Aristotle from the perspective of a liberal concerned to uphold the twin values of personal liberty and government based upon the rule of law, while recognizing the integral role of society to the development of individuality. Here two streams of thought&#151;those of whig liberalism and philosophical idealism&#151;competed for Barker's political sympathies. However, he could neither accept the negative attitude towards the state that came to characterize a Liberal like Dicey with links to whiggism, nor embrace wholeheartedly the identity of state and society which characterized idealism in its less guarded moments. In his preface Barker acknowledged a substantial debt to T. H. Green, whose conception of the conformity of the ideal with the reality of the state was notoriously qualified. Green's understanding of the state as inherently less than perfect was important in shaping Barker's judgement of the respective merits of Plato and Aristotle's political ideas: while Plato was chided for the &#145;zeal&#146; with which he pursued the notion of the state as the embodiment of reason and unity in society, Aristotle was praised for the more relaxed and flexible view that the state was merely &#145;the supreme association and the dominant end&#146;  (p. 228).<br>
<br>But further influences were at work too, not least a conception of English national character&#151;a touchstone that was to become increasingly pronounced in Barker's political thought: he remarked that while there was &#145;something French in Plato's mind, something of that pushing of a principle to its logical extremes&#146;, in Aristotle's thought &#145;it hardly seems fanciful to detect more of an English spirit of compromise&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle</span>, 162). Also, when Barker emphasized Aristotle's awareness that the state co-existed with other communities, that a precondition of unity was diversity  (ibid., 233), his receptiveness to the rising tide of pluralist thought is equally apparent. A deep impression had been made upon him by the legal historian F. W. Maitland, who introduced the pluralist ideas of the German jurist Otto von Gierke to an English readership in 1900. In 1897 he had heard Maitland deliver the Ford lectures, &#145;Township and borough&#146;, at Oxford, which he later recalled as a formative experience  (Barker, 330).<br>
<br>This synthesis of the ideas of idealism, whiggism, and pluralism characterized and informed Barker's thought in the decades to come. It was never an entirely stable and coherent synthesis: the balance he attempted to strike between individuals, voluntary societies, and the state was uneven, and at various times in his life he tended to favour one at the expense of another. Early on in his career, he was strongly drawn towards pluralism, although even then his support was never unreserved. Later, however, his allegiances shifted more towards sovereign authority (see his preface to the American edition of <span class="italic">Church, State, and Education</span>, 1957). A critical factor here was the clear demonstration in the inter-war period that groups can develop malignant tendencies, belying the &#145;clubbable&#146; side of associational life to which Maitland had warmed. When Barker turned to a translation of a further instalment of Gierke's <span class="italic">Genossenschaftsrecht</span>&#151;published as <span class="italic">Natural Law and the Theory of Society</span> in 1934&#151;his introduction was more sombre than Maitland's of some three decades earlier. Greatly disquieted by the &#145;upsurge&#146; of groups in continental Europe, he warned of the dangers of the Romantic legacy in the theory of groups, a legacy whose full implications were currently being drawn out in Germany  (<span class="italic">Natural Law and the Theory of Society</span>, xvii). But Romanticism was not only implicated in the ascendancy of racial exclusiveness in Germany: its spirit could also be detected in the dominance of nation in Italy and class in Russia  (<span class="italic">Reflections on Government</span>, 1942, 160, 163). Barker defended the <i>regnum</i> with new zest against these tendencies, not least out of a deep concern for individual liberty and the never more evident threat posed to it by the assignment of &#145;real personality&#146; to groups. He was drawn to the emphasis which Maitland gave to the associational instinct in British life, and also the stroke of genius by which the English system of equity had created trusts as diverse as churches, trade unions, Lloyd's Coffee House, the Jockey Club, and London clubs. The trust had allowed groups a considerable degree of latitude denied to them in Germany, where the odious &#145;concession&#146; theory of groups prevailed under Roman law. However, Barker himself was wary of groups and their capacity to browbeat both members and non-members alike. While he gave all the groups and institutions to which he belonged his full commitment, he readily confessed in his autobiography to an entrenched aversion to &#145;Institutionalism&#146;  (Barker, 304).<h2>
<a name="Studentsandreligion"></a>Students and religion</h2>Barker's two decades as a member of the Oxford modern history faculty were fruitful for him as both a teacher and a writer. He taught students as diverse as Harold Laski&#151;who became professor of political science at the London School of Economics in 1925&#151;and the Christian sociologist Maurice Reckitt. He kept his distance from the political and religious views of both writers, while recognizing their talents and enjoying their acclaim. He also taught T. E. Lawrence and his brother Will. But he seems to have been most stimulated by the pupils he taught from the Roman Catholic religious orders, which were beginning to re-establish themselves at Oxford at the end of the nineteenth century. He seems to have particularly enjoyed the company of the Benedictines, and through his pupils he established lasting links with two major Benedictine schools in England: Ampleforth and Douai. He also taught pupils who became leading Catholic writers and journalists: for example, Christopher Dawson, Douglas Jerrold, and Douglas Woodruff. While he seems never to have considered becoming a Catholic himself, he did convert from the Congregationalism in which he had been brought up to Anglicanism just before he left Oxford in 1920. His Congregational background at the Hatherlow Chapel near his home had steeled him against the agnosticism which he found widespread at Balliol as an undergraduate  (Barker, 301). But he did not conceive of his embrace of Anglicanism as a break with Congregationalism, nor as distancing himself from Catholic orders in England like the Benedictines  (ibid., 53). Indeed, he valued organized religion in all its diversity, and in particular its capacity to enrich national life, not least English national life, and to be enriched in turn.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWarnationalismandpatriotism"></a>First World War: nationalism and patriotism</h2>For the most part, Barker carried on teaching at Oxford during the First World War, drawn away only temporarily in order to, among other duties, inspect factories and works committees in the north of England for the Ministry of Labour. But he was by no means a passive bystander: a master of crisp and direct as well as erudite prose, he wrote solemn and persuasive defences of Britain's role in the war for popular audiences. With other history dons at Oxford, he contributed to a book entitled <span class="italic">Why we Are at War</span> (1914) and also wrote a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> which were brought together in <span class="italic">Mothers and Sons in Wartime</span> (1915). He deplored what he regarded as &#145;the worship of power&#146; in modern Germany, made evident in the actions of statesmen like Bismarck and in the ideas of philosophers such as Nietzsche and Treitschke alike. In other pamphlets he contrasted favourably British with German policy towards its constituent nations, noting in particular German repression of its linguistic minorities and British tolerance of the Irish language. Indeed, the war did much to crystallize his ideas on nationalism as a force for tyranny and instability. Far better, he argued in a journal article of 1919, to love one's neighbour than one's fellow national: neighbourliness was a &#145;quiet&#146; virtue, yet &#145;deep and permeating&#146; for all that  (&#145;Nationality&#146;, <span class="italic">History</span>, Oct 1919, 144). This was&#151;in effect&#151;a call for the elevation of patriotism over nationalism.<br>
<br>Translating this principle into the problem of Ireland, Barker supported home rule but not independence. He rejected moves to bestow dominion status on Ireland in 1921, proclaiming to A. D. Lindsay that he believed in &#145;the state rather than the nation&#146;  (Stapleton, <span class="italic">Englishness</span>, 97). None the less, while he stressed the priority of statehood over nationhood, and patriotism over nationalism, his unfailing loyalty to Britain was to the recognizably English symbols and institutions through which British identity was principally focused. This was not least because he conceived of England as a model of national inclusiveness&#151;a cardinal theme of the Stevenson lectures he gave in Glasgow, which were published as <span class="italic">National Character and the Factors in its Formation</span> in 1927 (see especially p. 194).<h2>
<a name="KingsCollegeLondon"></a>King's College, London</h2>The Stevenson lectures were the fruit of one of the few pieces of research Barker was able to undertake during his time as principal at King's College, London, from 1920 to 1927. He had not been able to resist the challenge of administration, an appetite for which had grown steadily upon him at Oxford. Also, he had developed London connections through his membership of the group formed around the periodical the <span class="italic">New Europe</span>&#151;an offshoot of the Round Table movement&#151;and spearheaded by such specialists in eastern European nationalism as R. W. Seton-Watson. At King's he enjoyed the stimulation of a notable academic community, and also forged ties with some of London's leading men of affairs. He did not feel at all disadvantaged by his working-class roots, as he was certain he would have done if he had become head of an Oxford college; in 1924 he was approached on several fronts concerning the forthcoming vacancy of the wardenship of New College  (Barker to Julian Huxley, 8 Nov 1924, Huxley MSS, Rice University). In London he was also well placed to become involved in government. For example, he was recruited to the Hadow committee, which produced the report <span class="italic">The Education of the Adolescent</span> in 1927. Barker believed fervently in the importance of public provision for practical secondary education, this being in keeping with what he perceived as the active and &#145;practical&#146; nature of &#145;the English genius&#146;. He insisted, however, that an education in practical things could be a liberal education, and as chairman of the drafting committee he would have been responsible for emphasizing the need for parity between the two streams of grammar and secondary modern schools.<br>
<br>There were difficult times as well, particularly those which stretched Barker's capacity to deal with conflict. One such episode was the controversy over the Koraes chair in modern Greek, a post that had been funded partially by the Greek government but which threw the college into crisis as the first incumbent, Arnold Toynbee, denounced Greek atrocities in Anatolia. He was also greatly disconcerted by the short skirts of female students at King's  (Catlin, 344&#150;5). However, Barker was certainly not opposed to greater opportunities for women, despite cautioning against attempts to ground those opportunities in logic and individualism. (See his &#145;History and the position of women&#146; in Z. Fairfield, ed., <span class="italic">Some Aspects of the Woman's Movement</span>, 1915, 44&#150;6.) As principal he did all he could to secure employment for young women such as May Wedderburn Cannan whose lives had been devastated by the First World War  (see Wedderburn Cannan, 172&#150;5). His time at King's was overshadowed by the death of his first wife in 1924.<h2>
<a name="Cambridge"></a>Cambridge</h2>It was with some sense of relief from the burdens of administrative office that Barker accepted in 1927 the offer of the newly established chair of political science at Cambridge, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was only the third such chair in Britain. He had married again earlier that year, on 24 March. His new wife was Olivia Stuart Horner (1891&#150;1976), daughter of John Stuart Horner, a Balliol man and director of an engineering firm; they had one son 
    (Nicolas John; <i>b</i>. 1932)
   and one daughter 
    (Sara Juliet; <i>b</i>. 1934)
  . While his eleven-year tenure of the chair was not notable for its wealth of publication, he laid the foundations for the long and productive retirement which followed. He became a fellow of Peterhouse and member of the Cambridge history faculty, which he chaired in the last three years before his retirement. He was charged with teaching the two political science papers which had been instituted by Sir John Seeley in the historical tripos. It was on the basis of the lectures that he had given for these courses, as well as those which he delivered as a visiting lecturer at other universities, that he published two widely used texts in post-war political studies, <span class="italic">Reflections on Government</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">Principles of Social and Political Theory</span> (1951). These books and other writings were also inspired by his work for the National Council of Social Service, through which he became the chairman of a committee which sought to enhance the provision of community centres on the new housing estates of inter-war Britain. This task seemed ripe for the application of pluralist ideals of voluntary association and Aristotle's notion of the optimum conditions of the good social life. His tenure of the Cambridge chair, and the writings that arose out of it subsequently, was enriched too by the generous opportunities for travel abroad that it afforded. While he did not take full advantage of the one term off in every three to which he was entitled, he nevertheless travelled extensively in Europe, America, and India.<h2>
<a name="Criticofpoliticalextremism"></a>Critic of political extremism</h2>First-hand experience of the fascist turn in the politics of continental Europe made a particularly deep impression on Barker  (Barker, 173). It helped to consolidate his ideas about the &#145;eruption of the group&#146; and consequent &#145;militarization of the conception of the political&#146; that constituted a unique contribution to political theory in the second quarter of the twentieth century  (<span class="italic">Reflections on Government</span>, 142, 271). He was one of few people in Britain to appreciate the force of the &#145;friend&#150;foe&#146; analysis of politics of the Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt. He easily straddled the institutional&#150;theoretical divide in political science through his studies of extremist political systems in inter-war Europe. These he contrasted with the democratic and legal institutions of Britain, in particular, the characteristics of which acquired new poignancy when set against the disturbing features of continental politics. In this sense, Barker's own doubts and those of others, notably his earlier memoirist George Catlin (see the entry he wrote for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and obituary in <span class="italic">PBA</span>), about his success in forging new paths for the discipline of politics were misplaced. Through deploying the traditional approaches of philosophy and history, he shed considerable light on contemporary political life.<br>
<br>Barker continued to assail Nazi, fascist, and Soviet dictatorship, and the ideologies which sustained them, throughout the 1930s. He exposed the evils of Nazism and Nazi propaganda&#151;for example, reproducing a Nazi school history textbook covering the period 1914 to 1933 for the Friends of Europe publications in 1933. He contrasted modern dictatorship with the dictatorships of ancient Rome in a lecture at Chatham House in 1934 (&#145;The prospects for democracy&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Citizen's Choice</span>, 1937). And he made trenchant criticisms of Marxism in the editorial he wrote for <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the fiftieth anniversary of Marx's death (14 March 1933). Nevertheless, Barker vociferously supported Chamberlain on appeasement, defending his &#145;realism&#146; against the &#145;Johnny Head-in-the-Air&#146; attitude towards Germany of those&#151;not least, fellow Liberals like Gilbert Murray&#151;who protested  (letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 March 1939). Throughout the 1930s he grew increasingly disenchanted with the Liberal Party, which had hitherto provided his principal political anchorage, disliking its tendency towards what he called &#145;abstract intellectualism&#146;. Indeed, so much was this the case that, like a fellow &#145;old&#146; Liberal, G. M. Trevelyan, he gravitated towards the Conservative historian and activist Arthur Bryant. He never gave up on Liberalism, however, and became a trenchant critic of the &#145;progressivism&#146; that issued in the post-war Labour government's penchant for planning (<span class="italic">Change and Continuity</span>, 1949).<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>Barker's retirement coincided with the outbreak of the Second World War. He was immediately recruited as director of studies for the courses in military and political studies which the War Office had established for selected officers, and which ran at Cambridge until 1941. As in the First World War, he also served his country through the pen, producing patriotic pamphlets for both the Ministry of Information at home and the British Council abroad. He worked closely with other scholars on more extended projects, editing, for example, <span class="italic">The Character of England</span> for Oxford University Press, which appeared in 1947. But he served the allied cause more widely through work which enhanced his European consciousness. He became chairman of the Books Commission established by the allied ministers of education in 1943. The commission's chief function was to provide a centre for the collection of books and periodicals and their dispersal to libraries in allied countries whose stock had been destroyed by bombing. For this work he was knighted in 1944.<br>
<br>Barker's new European horizons arising out of the war led to his editorship, with Paul Vaucher and George Clark, of <span class="italic">The European Inheritance</span> (1954). This work is significant in another respect. For despite Barker's concern to keep up his credentials as a &#145;publicist&#146;, which he had acquired at Oxford at the end of the nineteenth century  (Barker, 183), he produced a steady stream of scholarly writings throughout his retirement. A sense of scholarly duty led him to accept an invitation to lecture on political science from an English point of view at the University of Cologne in the winter of 1947&#150;8, a difficult although not unrewarding experience for a 73-year-old. The gratitude of the German government was made clear in the attendance of a representative of the German ambassador at the memorial service which was held for him at Peterhouse just after his death  (see <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Feb 1960, 12). The last four years of his life saw the publication of his histories of political thought through translated documents which spanned the Hellenic and patristic worlds and Byzantium, <span class="italic">From Alexander to Constantine</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">Social and Political Thought in Byzantium</span> (1957). He was also a founder member of the Political Studies Association of Great Britain (1950). His autobiography appeared in 1953.<br>
<br>Barker was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1947. He was awarded the degree of DLitt at Oxford (1922) and (<i>ad eundem</i>) Cambridge (1928); honorary doctorates were conferred on him by the universities of Edinburgh, Harvard, Calcutta, Dalhousie (Canada), and Salonica. His foreign distinctions included membership of the order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia) and the King Haakon VII liberty cross (Norway).<br>
<br>Tall and lanky in appearance, Barker never lost his broad Manchester accent. He was the subject of many anecdotes, nearly all of them affectionate and appreciative. He was a gifted and conscientious lecturer and tutor. Contemporaries remarked upon his frankness, na&iuml;ve curiosity, acuteness, integrity, and sometimes unexpected perverseness  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13a). He was hailed, however, as an exemplary citizen&#150;scholar for whom no service to the cause of greater intellectual and political understanding could be too much trouble. He died in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 17 February 1960; he was cremated, and his ashes were buried on 25 March 1961 in St Botolph's churchyard, Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="Barkersposthumousreputation"></a>Barker's posthumous reputation</h2>Barker's work plunged into a period of relative obscurity soon after his death. His ideas about democracy&#151;particularly the centrality to it of discussion&#151;enjoyed some prominence with the retreat from positivism in political science during the 1970s  (Holden, 118). However, interest in his work on a more concerted and wide-ranging scale began to pick up in the 1990s. This interest was fuelled by the revival of pluralism and ideas of civil association as the statism and class polarization of the post-war decades began to recede. Barker's writings seemed to strike relevant chords here. As well as becoming the subject of a full-scale study  (Stapleton, <span class="italic">Englishness</span>), Barker's interest in the relationship between church, state, and nationality was explored alongside that of other leading churchmen like William Temple  (Grimley). In 1997 his contribution to pluralist thought received its most extended and nuanced exploration yet  (Runciman). In addition, Barker began to attract attention as an exponent of civic nationalism more in keeping with the devolutionist times than the alternative &#145;ethnic&#146; model (Kearney; Aughey). Furthermore, work on Barker has also featured in studies of intellectuals in the twentieth century  (Jennings). The interest and sympathy that Barker has generated in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries draws much on his sense of the importance of diversity to unity in society and of community to individuality; the close integration of religion and culture; and the model he provided of the citizen&#150;scholar. But he would have been the last to claim that he had resolved any of these antinomies. The basis of his thought lay in a conception of the irreducible nature of human personality and the overriding priority of individual liberty.<br>
