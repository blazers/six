<span class="headword">Kirkland,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Thomas Kirkland (<i>d</i>. 1751), attorney-at-law, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Colonel Allsop, was born at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, and baptized there on 14 October 1722. He attended Ashbourne and Tamworth grammar schools and was apprenticed to Mr Holbrooke, a surgeon of Loughborough. After leaving Loughborough Kirkland travelled to London, where he attended the lectures of Thomas Lawrence, before returning to set up practice in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, some time before 1747. He married Dorothy Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of a barrister-at-law, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bate), on 3 August 1747. They had twelve children, six of whom died in infancy. In 1754 he published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Gangrenes</span>.<br>
<br>On Friday 18 January 1760 Kirkland, who was treating a patient at nearby Coleorton, received a message asking him to attend at Staunton Harold Hall, the home of Laurence Shirley, fourth Earl Ferrers (1720&#150;1760). Before arriving at the hall Kirkland was told that Lord Ferrers had shot and wounded James Johnson, his steward. Ferrers believed that Johnson had been conspiring against him in business matters, and after luring him to Staunton Harold Hall, shot Johnson, who was kneeling, from no more than 3 yards. Kirkland was aware that he was entering a potentially dangerous situation, as Ferrers was notorious for his violent behaviour and uncontrollable temper. He used violence towards both his mistress and his wife and was &#145;always carrying pistols to bed and threatening to kill her, and being jealous without provocation&#146;  (Crane, 7). Kirkland treated the injured Johnson in the presence of a clearly agitated and unstable Ferrers, and did all he could to calm Ferrers, who was still making threats against Johnson's life. Kirkland assured him that Johnson would live, in the hope that this would dissuade Ferrers from escaping and prevent him from causing any further bloodshed. Ferrers however warned him, &#145;Be sure Kirkland you don't tell me any lies, for by God, I shall break your head if you do&#146;  (Crane, 14). In a calmer interlude Ferrers offered to pay Kirkland for his services, an offer to which Kirkland wisely responded that he &#145;did not desire it but when it was most convenient for his Lordship&#146;  (Crane, 15). Later that evening Ferrers insisted that Kirkland should stay the night, and he offered Kirkland money if he would set the affair in a &#145;favourable light&#146;  (Crane, 14&#150;15).<br>
<br>After Ferrers had gone to bed that night, Kirkland left the hall, returning later with a group of seven or eight colliers, some of them armed, who collected the ailing Johnson and returned him to his home, where Kirkland stayed until 7 a.m. He then left to consult with a Mr Piddocke and a Mr Pestell, two local legal men, who advised that Ferrers should be arrested at once. John Johnson died at 9 a.m. Ferrers was arrested shortly afterwards, following a struggle with a group of local men, and was held at the White Hart public house in Ashby. &#145;I glory in his death&#146; was his response after being told of Johnson's fate  (Crane, 18).<br>
<br>Kirkland conducted the autopsy on Johnson's body before the inquest and<blockquote>found a wound made by a leaden bullet immediately under the lowest rib on his left side, which bullet passing obliquely downward had made another wound thro' the gut called Colon and going under the Psoas Muscle and thro' the Os Inominatium at its junction with the spine rested in the Os Sacrum, from which place I extracted it. (Crane, 19)</blockquote>Ferrers was found guilty of murder and hanged at Tyburn on 5 May 1760, his defence of &#145;occasional insanity of mind&#146; having been rejected  (Crane, 23). Kirkland later supplied a curious postscript to these events, which was published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> only after his death. On the day of Johnson's shooting Kirkland had a premonition in which he was in the House of Lords giving evidence in a murder trial; this, he said, caused him to be on his guard after receiving the message, later that day, which asked him to go to Staunton Harold Hall.<br>
<br>Kirkland led a less dramatic existence after these events. He published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Methods of Suppressing Haemorrhages from Divided Arteries</span> (1763), and <span class="italic">An Essay towards an Improvement in the Cure of those Diseases which are the Cause of Fevers</span> (1767). With the help of a testimonial from Erasmus Darwin, he was awarded an MD by St Andrews on 27 December 1769. He was a member of the Royal Medical societies of Edinburgh and London. Among his other publications were <span class="italic">A Treatise on Childbed Fevers with Two Dissertations, the one on the Brain, the other on the Sympathy of the Nerves</span> (1774), and <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Present State of Medical Surgery</span> (2 vols., 1783&#150;6).<br>
<br>Kirkland had a wide range of interests outside medicine; he took a keen interest in music, claiming to be the &#145;first Hoboy player in Ashby, and the worst in all England&#146;  (Crane, 54), subscribed to the foundation of an agricultural society for Leicestershire, and took pleasure from his garden, which he &#145;adorned with numerous statues and heathen deities&#146;  (Crane, 54). Kirkland died in Ashby-de-la-Zouch on 17 January 1798 and was buried on 22 January in St Helen's Church. He was survived by his sons and daughters.<br>
