<span class="headword">Blathwayt,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1650, <em>d.</em> 1717), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was baptized on 2 March 1650 at St Botolph, Aldersgate, London. He was the only son of William Blathwayt (1594&#150;<i>c</i>.1650), barrister of the Middle Temple, and Anne (<i>b</i>. 1618?, <i>d</i>. in or after 1673), daughter of Justinian Povey, accountant-general to Anne of Denmark and auditor of the exchequer. Blathwayt's father died soon after he was born, leaving an estate &#145;extremely embroil'd and impaired&#146;  (Glos. RO, MS D1799/C9), and he was brought up by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22640/', "Thomas Povey")</script>, a politician and successful, if sometimes inept, government and royal official of the Cromwellian and Restoration periods. In 1665 Blathwayt was admitted to the Middle Temple, London, and three years later, in 1668, Povey and Secretary of State Arlington induced Sir William Temple to employ the young Blathwayt as a clerk in the embassy at The Hague. His linguistic skill (he was the only official at the embassy who knew Dutch) rendered him a most useful member of the staff. After Temple's recall he returned to England (January 1672) in time to join the entourage of the duke of Richmond, who was departing on a diplomatic mission to Denmark. From there, Richmond sent him to Sweden and then to Germany; after Richmond's death Blathwayt continued to Italy on what had become a grand tour before returning to England in 1673.<br>
<br>With the help of the secretary of state Sir Joseph Williamson, Thomas Povey (himself an expert in colonial business), and Povey's friend Sir Robert Southwell, Blathwayt entered the plantations office in September 1675. The reorganization and expansion of plantation business in this period, combined with Blathwayt's capacity for hard work, facilitated his rapid rise; he became clerk-in-extraordinary of the privy council (July 1678) as a &#145;mark of &hellip; encouragement &hellip; for the pains he has taken in the plantation business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.444) and secretary to the lords of trade in December 1679. A reorganization of colonial finance in 1680 led to Blathwayt's appointment as surveyor and auditor-general of his majesty's revenues in America, a post which he held until his death, and from 1681 to 1683 he was under-secretary of state to Lord Conway in the northern department, transacting business with his customary efficiency. In 1683, with the permission of Charles II, who already had a particular &#145;kindness for him&#146;  (ibid., 4.449), he purchased the post of secretary at war. Royal favour from both Charles and his brother James significantly assisted Blathwayt in these years, and in 1686 he became clerk-in-ordinary of the privy council, although not without a struggle with another claimant to the vacancy, William Bridgeman. King James, reported Blathwayt importantly to his mentor Southwell, had been his &#145;Advocat &amp; Champion&#146;  (Glos. RO, MS D1799/C8). John Evelyn's diary entry for 18 June 1687 summarizes the impression made on one discerning observer: &#145;I din'd this day at Mr. Blathwaites &hellip; [he] having raised himselfe by his Industry, from very moderate Circumstances: He is a very proper handsome person, and very dextrous in buisinesse, and has besids all this married a very greate fortune&#146;  (Evelyn, 554).<br>
<br>This last reference was to Mary Wynter (1650&#150;1691), daughter and heiress to John Wynter of Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire. Blathwayt had initially considered her age uninviting (she was thirty-six) but soon claimed to be more interested in the person of the lady than in the size of the estate. The marriage contract was, however, constructed with that meticulous attention to financial detail which Blathwayt always displayed; the wedding took place on 23 December 1686. They had four sons, of whom two survived, William (1688&#150;1742) and John (1690&#150;1754), and a daughter, Anne (1691&#150;1717), who married the son of Sir Robert Southwell.<br>
<br>Blathwayt negotiated the difficulties of the revolution of 1688 successfully, despite having served as the chief government witness at the notorious trial of the seven bishops and having, as secretary at war, accompanied James II on the march to Salisbury. His many posts were, he claimed, all &#145;places of pains or Experience&#146;  (Glos. RO, D1799/C8), and, as he never tired of pointing out to his correspondents, they were mainly held during good behaviour rather than at pleasure. Blathwayt was challenged only in his tenure of the secretaryship at war. Sir William Temple's son, John, was appointed to the post in April 1689, but collapsed under the strain and Blathwayt was promptly reappointed. This Dutch-speaking administrator was clearly too useful to be dispensed with; William III found him dull (as did others) but admitted that he had &#145;a good method&#146;  (Foxcroft, 226). From 1692 to 1701 Blathwayt accompanied William on campaign to Flanders as his acting secretary of state; the king also recognized his unrivalled knowledge of the colonies in appointing him to the newly formed Board of Trade in 1696.<br>
<br>However, the death of William and the accession of Anne signalled the decline of Blathwayt's career. In 1702 he told George Stepney that he had been &#145;no ways concern'd in Politicks a great while&#146;; by 1706 he admitted to operating in a &#145;Lower Sphere&#146;  (Blathwayt papers, Box 21). He had been dismissed from the secretaryship at war in 1704; henceforth the post would be filled by a politician, not an administrator. In 1707 he lost his seat on the Board of Trade in a party purge; he had been blind to the implications of the rise of party and to the increased importance of parliament. He sat as MP for Newtown in the Isle of Wight on the government interest (1685&#150;7), and for Bath (1693&#150;1710) with the patronage of the duke of Beaufort. Although Stepney had once congratulated Blathwayt on having an &#145;unalterable&#146; interest at Bath, the duke of Beaufort's belief that Blathwayt had voted against the high-church clergyman Dr Sacheverell in the impeachment proceedings of 1710 meant the end of Blathwayt's parliamentary career.<br>
<br>Blathwayt's correspondence reveals that he preferred a mode of government modelled on the French example, an army promptly paid and efficiently run, and an empire overseen by honest and effective governors acting in the royal interest. It was a vision which could never be fully realized, particularly by someone who feared to offend the &#145;great men&#146; and whose patronage was limited, but he clung to it with tenacity throughout a career of almost fifty years. Together with other &#145;men of business&#146; he helped to make the civil service more professional and worked to strengthen England's sinews of power. None the less, like his fellow administrators, he operated within the standards of the day; an acquisitive man, he took palpable delight in the &#145;tributes&#146; that he received from grateful diplomats and colonial officials. Many of these gifts, such as the black walnut from Virginia, the cedar from Bermuda, and the deer from Germany, contributed to the stocking of Dyrham Park, rebuilt and refurnished by Blathwayt at vast expense, although in somewhat old-fashioned style, between 1692 and 1702. It was to Dyrham, its new fa&ccedil;ade supervised by the Huguenot architect Hauduroy, its east front designed by William Talman, comptroller of the royal works, its elaborate formal gardens, including the much admired fountains and &#145;cascade&#146;, laid out by the famous gardener George London, that Blathwayt rather reluctantly retired in the last years of his life. There he died, after what Horatio Walpole described as a &#145;desperate illness&#146;, on 26 August 1717; he was buried at Dyrham church on 30 August. His estate remained for many years in the possession of his descendants; the house and parkland are now in the hands of the National Trust.<br>
