<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mayne,  Michael Clement Otway</span>  (1929&#150;2006), <span class="occ">dean of Westminster</span>, was born on 10 September 1929 at the rectory, Harlestone, Northamptonshire, the only son of Michael Ashton Otway Mayne, rector of Harlestone, and his wife, Sylvia Clementina Lumley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellis. Reduced to penury by the sudden suicide of the father when Mayne was aged three, the family moved to London and then to Torbay, whence his mother was enabled by clergy charities to send him to King's School, Canterbury. There he disclosed his gift and enthusiasm for acting, and indeed stayed for an extra year in order to be able to play Hamlet in a school production. After national service in the RAF, in 1951 he went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where his passion for the theatre found abundant scope, though to the detriment of a good class in English and theology. In fact he would have followed a career on the stage had not his former headmaster, Canon John Shirley, steered him towards ordination. Accordingly Mayne went to Cuddesdon Theological College in 1955 and was ordained priest in 1957.<br>
<br>After a curacy at the church of St John the Baptist, Harpenden, Mayne was appointed domestic chaplain to Mervyn Stockwood, who had recently become bishop of Southwark. There he encountered some of the progressive movements that were seeking to revive the parochial life of the Church of England. There too he met 28-year-old Alison Geraldine McKie, daughter of Henry E. McKie, whom he married at Southwark Cathedral on 16 October 1965 and with whom he had a son and a daughter. In the same year he was appointed vicar of Norton, near Letchworth, Hertfordshire. In 1972 he was offered the post of head of religious programmes, BBC Radio. To this he brought his love of poetry and English literature, his enthusiasm for drama, and an instinctive concern for quality of editing and production. This experience in religious broadcasting made him a favoured candidate to be the vicar of Great St Mary's, the university church in Cambridge, where he worked from 1979 to 1986, developing a significant ministry, not just to undergraduates but to his clerical and lay colleagues in the university. He also compiled and published a small book for clergy, <span class="italic">Prayers for Pastoral Occasions</span> (1982).<br>
<br>The end of Mayne's time at Cambridge was deeply affected by the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome (ME), which forced him to take a year's leave, but which was also to inspire his first substantial book, <span class="italic">A Year Lost and Found</span> (1987), in which he chronicled the spiritual journey he had been forced to travel during this time. Meanwhile he had been offered appointment as dean of Westminster, and the ME was sufficiently in remission for him to be able to take it up in 1986, just in time to conduct the marriage of the duke and duchess of York.<br>
<br>Mayne's predecessor at Westminster, Edward Carpenter, had made the abbey well known for (sometimes controversial) ecumenical and inter-faith events. The changes Mayne made were, by contrast, primarily to do with the worship and pastoral ministry of the abbey: he devoted much attention to strengthening the &#145;family&#146; sense of the large community of paid and unpaid workers, and he rearranged Sunday morning services so as to make the sung eucharist the principal service, conducted at a moveable altar below the sacrarium steps with (eventually) full eucharistic vestments. He also used to the full the opportunity the abbey offered to exploit and strengthen his ties with members of the acting profession, not only through their contributions as readers at memorial services, but by inviting them to choose and read their favourite poems at evening gatherings in the Jerusalem Chamber, thereby raising large sums of money for AIDS charities, a cause to which Mayne was deeply committed, along with work for refugees and the promotion of human rights. Shortly before his retirement he brought to completion the project that had been closest to his heart, the creation of a monument outside the west front of the abbey to all innocent victims of oppression, violence, and war, which was unveiled by the queen in 1996 in the presence of a poignant group of surviving victims.<br>
<br>While at Westminster Mayne had written another book, <span class="italic">This Sunrise of Wonder</span> (1995), in the form of reflective letters to his grandchildren. After his retirement in 1996 (when, as was customary, he was appointed KCVO) he moved to Salisbury, where he continued to raise money, often through theatrical ventures, for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and other charities. He also wrote <span class="italic">Pray, Love, Remember</span> (1998), Lenten reflections based on experiences at the abbey, <span class="italic">Learning to Dance</span> (2001), the metaphor of dancing applied to literature, the natural world, and religion, and <span class="italic">The Enduring Melody</span> (2006), a deeply spiritual chronicle of his struggle with terminal cancer of the floor of the mouth, which was published shortly before his death at his home, 37 St Mark's Road, Salisbury, on 22 October 2006. The funeral was held at Salisbury Cathedral, and he was cremated at Salisbury crematorium on 3 November 2006, and survived by his wife and children. A memorial service was held on 1 February 2007 at Westminster Abbey.<br>
