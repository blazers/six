<span class="headword">Verrio,  Antonio</span>  (<em>c.</em>1639&#150;1707), <span class="occ">decorative painter</span>, was born in the Neapolitan city of Lecce, the son of Giovanni Lycien (&#145;of Lecce&#146;). (Verrio's early work <span class="italic">St Francis Appearing to Father Mastrilli</span> survives in the Convitto Nazionale, Lecce.) Verrio's early career took him to Naples, where he worked for the Jesuit college, and then to other Italian cities such as Florence, Rome, and Genoa. His artistic training is uncertain, but a local artist in Lecce, Giuseppe Verrio, may have been his uncle and first teacher. By 1655 he had married Massenzia Tornese. Although Verrio's first biographer, Bernardo De Dominici, stated that Verrio drowned in France, it is clear that he was living and working in Toulouse by 1666. By 3 July 1668 he was married to Fran&ccedil;oise De Angeli, whose surname is recorded in the register at Toulouse Cathedral as &#145;dangely&#146;. Verrio's gregarious personality seems to have made more of an impression on his biographer for this period, J. Malliot, than his painting; little information survives recording his work at this time. More importantly for his English career, by 1671 he was working in Paris, where during the following year he became a member of the Acad&eacute;mie Royal de Peinture. It is thought that he worked at Versailles under Charles Le Brun and there learned to paint in the rich baroque style which helped to create the atmosphere of the court of Louis XIV.<br>
<br>Ralph Montagu, later first duke of Montagu, the English ambassador to the French court in Paris, persuaded Verrio to travel to England in 1672 to decorate the staircase and great room of Montagu House in London. Montagu introduced Verrio to his first significant patron, Henry Bennet, first Lord Arlington, for whom Verrio worked at Euston Hall, Suffolk, his country seat, and in London (at Arlington House, on the site later occupied by Buckingham House and Palace) in 1674. Charles II first encountered Verrio at Arlington House, and it was through Lord Montagu that he was given his first royal appointment as designer for the newly revived Mortlake tapestry works, of which Montagu was in charge from 1674. Verrio's first-known easel painting from his English period, a <span class="italic">Sea Triumph of Charles II</span> (Royal Collection), may date from this time, as it appears to have been painted with the royal appointment in mind. The first volume of Edward Croft-Murray's <span class="italic">Decorative Painting in England, 1537&#150;1837</span> (1962) includes a catalogue of Verrio's works.<br>
<br>Verrio was denizened on 5 May 1675. He did not spend long at Mortlake and was soon engaged on a more significant commission, the redecoration of Hugh May's reconstructed north range of Windsor Castle, for which he was paid over &pound;7000 in twelve years. This was to be his principal occupation from 1675 to 1684 and included the decoration of the king's chapel, St George's hall, and around twenty ceilings and three staircases. The interiors he participated in creating at Windsor Castle for Charles II were among the finest baroque decorative schemes ever produced in Great Britain. Almost all of his work was destroyed by George IV's reconstruction of the castle (under Jeffry Wyatville) in the 1820s and 1830s, but visual sources convey an impression of his work at Windsor. Among these are three engravings of lost ceilings by Pierre Vanderbank and W. H. Pyne's aquatint views illustrated in his <span class="italic">Royal Residences</span> (1819), as well as the few fragments (notably the newly discovered portrait, still on its original plaster, of Charles II, from the ceiling of St George's hall) that survive in the Royal Collection.<br>
<br>Verrio's treatment of the architectural spaces at Windsor (and his subsequent work) relied heavily upon Italian baroque models. The ceilings were painted as if open to a mythological sky, populated with historical figures or gods, often elaborately foreshortened. The space between the walls and ceilings, often conveniently coved at Windsor, was generally painted with a balustrade, or other architectural device, so as to manage the difficult transition between myth and reality. St George's hall was decorated with subjects glorifying England's national saint and the Order of the Garter, while the king's chapel was dominated by a rendition of Christ healing the sick. In both spaces Verrio introduced a pattern for treating a huge expanse of wall which was accepted as the standard method of adorning staircases and large rooms for the next fifty years. The principal figural composition is set on a stage framed by a painted proscenium or screen, the columns of which support the false parapet or open dome surrounding the &#145;sky&#146; on the ceiling. Thus the greater part of the architectural embellishment of the room is created by the ingenuity of the painter.<br>
<br>The sheer scale of the work at Windsor necessitated the employment of a large team of assistants, most of whom were French or Flemish. Of those listed in a warrant of 1678, the most significant was Louis Laguerre, who later had a successful career in England in his own right. The artists involved were often specialists, for instance Ren&eacute;e Cousin, a French gilder.<br>
<br>Verrio's undertaking at Windsor did not prevent his accepting the commission for a vast group portrait of the founders for the hall of Christ's Hospital. The piece, which was painted in oil on canvas in three sections, survives in the rebuilt mathematical school at Horsham, Sussex (as does a much reduced copy made for Samuel Pepys, now in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut). The work progressed very slowly, partly because Charles II's death in 1685 meant that his portrait had to be replaced by that of James II as the principal figure in the composition. The final payment to Verrio took place in 1687. The work is best described as a baroque version of the traditional &#145;foundation picture&#146;.<br>
<br>After his work on Hugh May's remodelled apartments at Windsor was complete, Verrio continued to receive royal commissions from James II, namely the decoration of Henry VIII's chapel at Windsor and the decoration of the chapel at Whitehall Palace, both for the Roman Catholic rite. In 1684 he was appointed chief painter to his majesty, at a salary of &pound;200. Verrio was also known as a gardener, and it seems that he laid out the garden at Whitehall during this period, almost certainly using the principles established by Le N&ocirc;tre, which he would have seen in practice at Versailles. By 1686 Verrio had been made &#145;principal Gardiner &amp; Surveyor to the King&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.61) and had remodelled the gardens of St James's Palace, where he was living. Accounts describe him as a very sociable person, given to high living and entertaining in a lavish style. He was a member of the Society of Painters, an early artists' club. However, his time in London ended abruptly at the revolution of 1688, as his sympathies lay with the Jacobites and he refused to work for the new monarchy. In 1690 Fran&ccedil;oise Verrio returned to France.<br>
<br>Verrio spent the next ten years or so in the country, mostly at Burghley House, Northamptonshire, and then at Chatsworth, Derbyshire. At the former he decorated six rooms and the staircase ceiling for John, fifth earl of Exeter, the most famous being the so-called heaven room, which depicts the capture of Mars and Venus in Vulcan's net. He was eventually persuaded to return to work for the crown, firstly back at Windsor. However, his major commission at this time was the decoration of Hampton Court Palace from 1701 onwards, where his work survives intact. There he decorated the entire interior of a small banqueting house by the river (the sketch for the ceiling is in the Victoria and Albert Museum), as well as the huge king's staircase and the queen's drawing room. Criticisms, particularly of the colouring, that have been levelled at these last works can be explained partly by Verrio's increasing loss of sight, which might have led to the accentuation of the least attractive elements in his paintings. He finished the last of these works in mid-1704, by which time he was almost completely blind.<br>
<br>Verrio retired on a royal pension of &pound;200 a year. He died at his lodgings at Hampton Court on 15 June 1707, having made his will two days before. He made bequests to his two sons, John Baptist and Ffrancisco, and his two grandchildren, John Baptist and Mary. The &#145;Inventory of the Goods Chattels and Creditts of Anthony Verrio at his Lodgings at Hampton Court&#146;, which includes a valuation of these effects, made on 2 July 1707, provides a detailed account of the interior furnishings of his home  (TNA: PRO, PROB 32/50/1).<br>
