<span class="headword">Townshend,  George</span>, second Marquess Townshend  (1753&#150;1811), <span class="occ">antiquary and politician</span>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27624/', "George Townshend, first marquess (1724&#150;1807)")</script>, and his first wife, Charlotte Compton, Baroness Ferrers and Compton (<i>d</i>. 1770), was born on 18 April 1753. He was educated at Eton College from 1 April 1761 to 1770 and at St John's College, Cambridge, which he entered on 20 November 1770, and was created MA on 6 July 1773. As a young man he served in the army; he was gazetted cornet in the 9th dragoons on 29 September 1770, lieutenant in the 4th regiment of horse on 1 October 1771, and captain in the King's light dragoons on 31 December 1771. On his mother's death, on 14 September 1770, he succeeded to the baronies of Ferrers (or, as he preferred it, de Ferrars) and Compton. Relations with his father broke down in 1774 as Lord Townshend, heavily encumbered by debt, attempted to secure the agreement of his son to the breakup of the entail on the family estates. Ferrars agreed, but only on terms which his father found objectionable. On 24 December 1777, at Lambeth Palace chapel, he married Charlotte (<i>bap</i>. 1754, <i>d</i>. 1802), the second daughter and coheir of Eaton Mainwaring Ellerker of Risby Park, Yorkshire. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27626/', "George Ferrars Townshend")</script> (who succeeded his father in his titles but was disinherited from the Raynham estate in Norfolk) and Charles Vere Ferrars. Their marriage lasted until Charlotte's death, at Bristol Hotwells, on 2 February 1802.<br>
<br>Ferrars did not play a major political role in the House of Lords, although he did speak in a number of debates; in 1775 he spoke on 26 October, when he declared that he should oppose all the measures of the court, although out of respect to his father he forbore to begin doing so that day. When the whigs returned to office in the spring of 1782 he was made a privy councillor and was nominated captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners. The younger Pitt reappointed him to that post in December 1783, and on 5 March 1784 he was named a member of the committee of the privy council which managed colonial commerce until the Board of Trade was constituted. On 18 May that year Ferrars was created earl of Leicester. His father, from whom he had sought permission to assume the title, had told him that he might take any title but that of Viscount Townshend. The earldom of Leicester had in fact been extinct since 1759. Charles James Fox had wished to give it to his friend Thomas Coke, whose family had possessed it after the Sidneys, and a new earldom of Leicester of Holkham was created for Coke in 1837.<br>
<br>In February 1788 Leicester signed a protest against Lord Thurlow's proposal that the Commons should produce evidence in support of Warren Hastings's impeachment before calling on the defendant. He was master of the Royal Mint from 20 January 1790 to July 1794 and held the office of joint postmaster-general from January 1790 to February 1799. On 20 February 1799 he was named lord steward of the household, an office which he held until August 1802. In January 1806 he wrote to Grenville in anticipation of a new ministry, requesting that he should be reinstated as superintendent of the Post Office&#151;an ambition which fell foul of the need for inclusiveness in the ministry of all the talents. On the death of his father in 1807 he succeeded as second Marquess Townshend.<br>
<br>Leicester was a keen amateur antiquary from his youth, being particularly interested in heraldry and archaeology. Walpole referred to his &#145;violent passion for ancestry&#146;&#151;which Walpole alleged he preferred to gambling  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 7.159). He devoted considerable effort to establishing his own genealogical claim to the earldom of Derby, held in the middle ages by the Ferrers family. After the death in 1784 of the president of the Society of Antiquaries, Jeremiah Milles, he was swiftly elected to the council of the society and made a vice-president, preparatory to his planned election as president. Meanwhile, Edward King was elected temporary president, on the understanding that he would cede his position to Leicester in the official elections to be held in April. King claimed later to have had a completely different understanding of the arrangements, and challenged Leicester for president in the first contested election in the society's history. Leicester won by a majority of two to one, and magnanimously included the defeated King at the top of his house lists. King was less gracious in defeat; he had been accused of underhand dealings in the campaign, and after 1784 rarely attended the meetings of the society.<br>
<br>Leicester provided a good figurehead for the society, offering social and fashionable cachet, as well as having some credibility as an antiquary. The society had recently moved to accommodation in Somerset House, and its membership was rapidly expanding and included increasing numbers of gentlemen from &#145;polite society&#146;. Although he neither followed up the administrative reforms which King had swiftly implemented nor acted as a dynamic intellectual force, he was conscientious in attending council meetings and was willing to allow his fellow antiquaries to exploit the aristocratic connection. It was through his intervention that Richard Gough gained permission to dedicate his new edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> to George III in 1789. He particularly associated himself with the antiquities of Leicestershire: John Throsby, the historian of Leicester, dedicated his history to him, and John Nichols acknowledged his assistance in the preface to his history of Leicestershire, the first volume of which was dedicated to the earl. Leicester was also admitted to the Royal Society in 1781 and was made a trustee of the British Museum in 1787. He continued as president of the Society of Antiquaries until his sudden death, at Richmond, Surrey, on 27 July 1811. He was buried at Raynham, Norfolk.<br>
