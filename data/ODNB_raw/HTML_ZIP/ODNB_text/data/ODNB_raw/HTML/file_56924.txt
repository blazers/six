<span class="headword">Rowe,  Arthur Walton</span>  (1859&#150;1926), <span class="occ">doctor and geologist</span>, was born on 27 September 1859 at 1 Gooch Street, Margate, the son of Thomas Rowe, a medical practitioner in the town, and his wife, Ellen Rosa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Betts). He was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and, after deciding to pursue a medical career, he attended St Mary's Hospital, London. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1883, and then went to the University of Durham, where he graduated with first-class honours in 1884. Although offered a position as house surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, where he had held other posts, his father's poor health led to Rowe's joining the family practice in Margate. Later, after building up the practice, he held various posts as medical adviser and surgeon at local hospitals and institutions. On 12 November 1887 he married Emily Barton (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), the daughter of George Kingston Barton, physician, of Fulbeck, Grantham, and Hong Kong.<br>
<br>Rowe's first geological interest was in the Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary formations around Margate. He instituted new methods of preparing invertebrate fossils and utilized dental machinery for extracting and cleaning chalk fossils, a process he described in his first paper (1896). Rowe never allowed his research to interfere with his medical practice and he carried it out during spare time after a day's work; most of his fieldwork was achieved each year during his spring and late autumn holidays. Aided and encouraged by C. Davies Sherborn, Rowe provided the first comprehensive account of the coastal sections of the English Chalk in a succession of papers dealing with Kent and Sussex (1902), Dorset (1903), Devon (1904), Yorkshire (1905), the Isle of Wight (1908), and Lincolnshire (published posthumously, by Sherborn and Withers, 1930). In these he established the value of fossils in determining chalk stratigraphy. His pertinacious collecting demonstrated the value of systematically obtaining quantities of material throughout a sequence and resulted in a prolific collection (some 30,000 fossils). However, his collecting was neither consistent nor as meticulous as he claimed and its accuracy has subsequently been questioned.<br>
<br>The Chalk papers were inextricably linked with Rowe's earlier research; &#145;The evolution of the genus <i>Micraster</i>&#146; (1899) was the first paper to deal with the variation and changes that occurred in Cretaceous Echinodermata, but it made no attempt to explain them. This classic has been regarded as &#145;one of the warhorses of English palaeontological literature&#146;  (Eldredge and Gould). But initially, as the ideas in the paper were ahead of its time, the council of the Geological Society were very wary of publishing it until Rowe finally lost his patience, writing, &#145;You can take it or leave it, and I do not care a damn which!&#146;  (Norman, 42) In 1910 Rowe's wife inherited a considerable sum of money, which enabled him to retire from medicine and devote his time to geological research.<br>
<br>Rowe was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1893 and was awarded the Wollaston fund in 1901 for his work on <i>Micraster</i>. In 1911 he was awarded the Lyell medal, in recognition of the importance of his work on the zones of the English Chalk. His own knowledge of the chalk fauna was so extensive that these papers remained the most important source of information until the 1950s. Yet his forceful advocacy of zonal stratigraphy, together with his denigration of the use of lithology in correlation, hindered research until the recent revival of studies on chalk sedimentology.<br>
<br>In later life, Rowe became interested in local archaeological finds, and continued his investigations into the past history of Margate. Over the years he had been active in establishing several local societies; he served on the town council and in the chamber of commerce. Ill health interrupted his research on the chalk, but in his last years he was engaged on describing the Serpulae (marine worms) occurring in that formation. Unfortunately his refusal to have medical treatment for an infected tooth led to the more general illness that lasted for over a year and ended in his death on 17 September 1926 at his home, Shottendane, Margate. (He was buried on 23 September in Margate cemetery.) Rowe has always been recognized as a highly gifted geologist, who made important contributions to chalk stratigraphy and evolutionary palaeontology, but who had remained an amateur owing to his medical career. He was said to have had &#145;an unfailing charm of manner, a personal magnetism, and a cheery optimism&#146;  (Kitchin), qualities that endeared him to all those he attended in his medical capacity.<br>
