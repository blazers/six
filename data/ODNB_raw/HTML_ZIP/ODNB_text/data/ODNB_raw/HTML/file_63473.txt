<span class="headword">Kinsman,  Andrew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1724, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was baptized at Tavistock parish church, Devon, on 11 November 1724, the son of John Kinsman and Mary, his wife. He was converted to Methodism about 1740 by reading the sermons of George Whitefield, whom he met locally in 1744. Though he maintained contact with local Wesleyan Methodists, and knew both John and Charles Wesley, Kinsman held to the Calvinistic Methodism learned from Whitefield. He moved to Plymouth in 1745 and joined a Methodist society of Whitefield's converts. Ann Tiley (<i>d</i>. 1774) had given a site in Bretonside in the town for a tabernacle (or chapel) in 1744, and on 28 October of the following year she and Kinsman were married. This gave him a controlling position in the tabernacle, for many years the leading centre of Methodism in Plymouth. In 1753 he strengthened his position by opening a chapel in Devonport called the Upper Room. His wife died in July 1774 and in October 1776 he married Mrs Joanna Webber of London, who survived him.<br>
<br>At first the tabernacle was supplied by a series of itinerant Calvinistic Methodist preachers, but by 1748 Kinsman took over the leadership and from 1750 preached regularly. He was ordained a minister at Broadmead Baptist chapel in Bristol on 4 August 1763 by five nonconformist and Methodist preachers. After this he was much in request to preach in other churches each summer, when he employed students (usually connected with the countess of Huntingdon) as temporary ministers for his two chapels. He had continued his grocery business, but in 1771 he gave it to his son and went to live at Devonport. For a year before his death at Devonport on 28 February 1793 he suffered from dropsy. He was buried in Stoke Damerel parish churchyard in Devonport after a service in his Upper Room. In his lifetime Kinsman maintained the Methodist character of his two Calvinistic congregations, but after his death both embraced dissent.<br>
