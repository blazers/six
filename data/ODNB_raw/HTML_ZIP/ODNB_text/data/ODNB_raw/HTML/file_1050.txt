<span class="headword">Baikie,  William Balfour</span>  (1825&#150;1864), <span class="occ">traveller and surgeon</span>, eldest son of Captain John Baikie RN, was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, on 27 August 1825 and educated privately and at the grammar school there. After taking his degree in medicine at Edinburgh, he entered the Royal Navy in 1848 as assistant surgeon. He served on the <i>Volage</i>, <i>Vanguard</i>, <i>Ceylon</i>, <i>Medusa</i>, and <i>Hibernia</i> in the Mediterranean, and then as assistant surgeon at the Haslar Hospital, Portsmouth, from 1851 to 1854. In 1852 he won the support of Sir Roderick Murchison for a South American expedition up New Granada's Magdalena River, which, however, never came to fruition. Murchison later procured for him the post of surgeon and naturalist to the Niger expedition of 1854, which tried to ascend the Niger in a purpose-built steamer, the <i>Pleiad</i>, and form a trading settlement in the interior. On the death of John Beecroft at Fernando Po, Baikie took command of the expedition. He demonstrated the navigability of the Niger and the value of quinine as a prophylactic against malaria. He clarified the topography of the area, providing information for a map by John Arrowsmith. His <span class="italic">Narrative of an Exploring Voyage up the &hellip; Niger and Isadda</span> (1856) gives a good account of his journey, but was criticized for understating the importance of the Royal Geographical Society in the expedition, an oversight which Baikie was careful to correct in his later publications.<br>
<br>The expedition returned to England in February 1855. Murchison and Baikie, who had returned to the Haslar Hospital, immediately began a successful campaign for a second expedition, which set off in 1857. Baikie had particular instructions to investigate the geology of the area for scientific and commercial ends. He went up the Niger in the iron steamer <i>Day Spring</i>, but was shipwrecked at the Bussa rapids. However, he bought land at Lokoja at the confluence of the Kw&ograve;ra and Ch&agrave;dda or Benu&eacute; and soon had a considerable settlement there, which remained under his authority after the abandonment of a scheme to bring it under government control as part of a drive to secure cotton supplies. He explored the surrounding countryside and persuaded the king of Nup&eacute;, the next powerful sovereign to the sultan of Sakat&ugrave;, to help the passage of traders by land and river to Lokoja. He opened up the navigation of the Niger, made roads, and established a regular market. The more ambitious schemes for exploiting the Niger came to nothing, however, and Baikie was called home for health reasons, but died <i>en route</i> at Sierra Leone on 12 December 1864. Baikie was far more scholarly than most African travellers, and his numerous books and articles in the journals of learned societies, published in his lifetime and posthumously, cover a wide range of topics; he wrote on the history and natural history of Orkney, and works on and in African languages, in which he had become interested on his second visit to the continent.<br>
