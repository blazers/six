<span class="headword">Oldys,  William</span>  (1696&#150;1761), <span class="occ">herald and antiquary</span>, was born on 14 July 1696, probably in London, the son of the civil lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20698/', "William Oldys (1636&#150;1708)")</script> and his mistress, his cousin Ann Oldys (1671&#150;1711).<h2>
<a name="Familybackground"></a>Family background</h2>Oldys's grandfather, also <a name="cosubject_20697"></a><span class="headword">William Oldys</span>  (1590/91&#150;1645)<span class="occ"></span>, matriculated aged nineteen at New College, Oxford, in 1610, graduated BA in 1614 and MA in 1618, and was a proctor of the university in 1623. He was vicar of Adderbury in Oxfordshire from 1627 and was created DD on 16 January 1643. A staunch supporter of Charles I during the civil war, Oldys went into hiding in Banbury, but was betrayed while conducting his wife, Margaret 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Sacheverall, <i>d</i>. 1705)
  , and his third son, William, on the road to Winchester. Pursued by parliamentary forces, his horse refused to pass his own house at Adderbury and he was shot and killed by one of the soldiers on 12 September 1645. A long inscription from the monument in Adderbury church was published in 1785 in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (volume 55, pp. 106&#150;7). His son William was married to Theodosia Lovett, and kept his cousin Ann as his mistress. Ann was maintained &#145;very privately, and probably very meanly&#146;, Oldys sending her leftover food from taverns on the excuse that it was for his cat  (Noble, 419). He died in 1708, and whereas his library was bought by Doctors' Commons, he left two houses in Kensington and the residue of his estate to his &#145;loving cozen Mrs. Ann Oldys&#146;; she died in 1711, leaving her property to &#145;her loving friend&#146; Benjamin Jackman, &#145;for the benefit of her son William Oldys&#146;, the future herald, who always claimed Dr Oldys for his father. She further left &#145;the tuition and guardianship of her son &hellip; during his minority&#146; to Jackman  (Yeowell, vi).<h2>
<a name="Earlystudies"></a>Early studies</h2>Although the young William Oldys was left money for his education, nothing is known of it. He lost money in the South Sea Bubble of 1720, and involved himself in protracted litigation. In 1722&#150;3 he collaborated with Pierre des Maizeaux on a biography of Richard Carew, for a new edition of his <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span>, but his literary studies were otherwise concentrated upon an interleaved, annotated copy of Langbaine's <span class="italic">Account of the Early Dramatic Poets</span> (1691). In 1724 Oldys left his London lodgings, in the house of a Mr Burridge, and went to Yorkshire, where he lived, principally at the seat of the first earl of Malton, until 1730. In 1725 he visited the museum of the recently deceased Ralph Thoresby in Leeds. In 1729 he wrote &#145;An essay on epistolary writings, with respect to the grand collection of Thomas, earl of Strafford&#146;, dedicating it to the earl of Malton (it is now in the Beinecke Library, c476). He was unable to prevent the destruction of the manuscript collections of the antiquary Richard Gascoigne by Thomas Wentworth, Baron Malton, in 1728. He was, however, compiling collections of his own, such as the 200 volumes he bought from the library of the earl of Stamford, the earl of Clarendon's collections of historical and political manuscripts, other state papers, and &#145;a very large collection of English heads in sculpture&#146;  (Yeowell, xii).<br>
<br>Oldys is credited with <span class="italic">A Collection of Epigrams</span> (1727). Between 1728 and 1731 he wrote some twenty papers for Henry Baker's <span class="italic">Universal Spectator</span>. On his return to London in 1730 he found his books had been dispersed, including the annotated Langbaine, which had been bought by Thomas Coxeter, who would not return it. On Coxeter's death his books were bought by Thomas Osborne, and they were sold again in 1748; Oldys's notes and Coxeter's additions were heavily used by Theophilus Cibber and Robert Shiels in <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span> (5 vols., 1753). About 1730 Oldys compiled a manuscript case (now in the British Library) for a projected edition of <span class="italic">The Negotiations of Sir Thomas Roe</span>, one volume of which eventually appeared in 1740. About 1731 Oldys became friendly with Edward Harley, the second earl of Oxford, who visited him in Gray's Inn in London and paid &pound;40 for his collections. Oldys used Harley's library for his <span class="italic">Dissertation upon Pamphlets</span> of 1731 (reprinted with another contribution in Morgan's <span class="italic">Phoenix Britannicus</span> of 1732) and other bibliographical work. He contributed songs such as &#145;Busy, Curious, Thirsty Fly!&#146; (later translated into Latin by Samuel Johnson) to <span class="italic">The Scarborough Miscellany</span> between 1732 and 1734, while working on his first major publication, an edition of Sir Walter Ralegh's <span class="italic">History of the World</span> (2 vols., 1736). This was prefaced by a colossal &#145;Life of the author, newly compil'd, from materials more ample and authentick than have yet been publish'd&#146;. A surviving letter to Sir Hans Sloane, dated 29 September 1735, indicates that Oldys was using the baronet's collection for research alongside Harley's. Gibbon was so impressed by Oldys's work that he abandoned his own plans to write a biography of Ralegh.<br>
<br>Grose records that the booksellers were sufficiently impressed by the success of the Ralegh volume to offer to pay Oldys for the use of his name in selling a different work, and that Oldys indignantly refused the offer, despite his insecure financial position. He was generous in assisting editors and booksellers with information, furnishing the importunate Edmund Curll with some notes on Nell Gwyn for a <span class="italic">History of the Stage</span> (1741), and giving biographical notices on scarce authors to Elizabeth Cooper (for <span class="italic">The Muses Library</span>, 1737) and Thomas Haywood (for <span class="italic">The British Muse</span>, 3 vols., 1738, which had a dedication to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu written by Oldys). Mrs Cooper, whose anthology was dedicated to the Honourable Society for the Encouragement of Learning and contained passages of Langland, Lydgate, and Hoccleve, as well as later writers, also borrowed many of Oldys's rare books for a proposed continuation, which failed to appear. In 1737 Oldys began publishing his own researches in <span class="italic">The British Librarian</span>, a miscellaneous bibliographical compilation of rare books and manuscripts. It was published in six monthly numbers, from January to June 1737, and was thereafter issued as a composite volume with an index of subjects in 1738. It was designed to bring to light &#145;curious&#146; publications and to offer a bibliographical record for early books: three William Caxton items, from the collection of Peter Thompson, are described, together with works by St Gildas, Thomas More, Richard Hakluyt, Thomas Elyot, William Prynne, Elias Ashmole, and Robert Plot. Each number contained at least one manuscript item. Oldys had used the libraries of the duke of Montagu, John Anstis, Thomas Ames, and some of his neighbours in Gray's Inn&#151;Nathaniel Booth and Charles Grimes. The book was prefaced by an optimistic statement of editorial intention, but in the postscript (from Gray's Inn, dated 18 February [1738]) Oldys cites the &#145;vast and unseen Mass of Reading&#146; needed to produce the comparatively &#145;small Quantity of Writing&#146;  (W. Oldys, <span class="italic">The British Librarian</span>, 1738, 375) as a reason for discontinuing the project for the time being. A surviving diary for the period from 1737 to 1738 contains little personal information but records conversations with scholars such as Joseph Ames, Thomas Birch, John Strype, Hans Sloane, George Vertue, and John Christopher Pepusch. Oldys records sales, visits to scientific exhibitions, curious events, and scraps of information, with reminders to himself to check particular sources. He makes many complaints about poor treatment by patrons, collectors, and scholars, and expresses his displeasure at the way his prefatory essay to Hayward's <span class="italic">British Muse</span>, containing a history of anthologies, had been hastily abridged.<h2>
<a name="Harleysliterarysecretary"></a>Harley's literary secretary</h2>Oldys's diary ends with the arrival of some money from Harley. On reading <span class="italic">The British Librarian</span>, Harley promised Oldys more remunerative employment and dissuaded him from applying to Sir Robert Walpole, about whose ancestors Oldys had collected some deeds. In 1738 Oldys, having detached himself from all other patronage, became Harley's literary secretary (and drinking companion), a position which allowed him free use of the library and an introduction to Oxford's circle, which included Alexander Pope. Pope told him Thomas Betterton's story that Sir William Davenant was the natural son of Shakespeare, and Oldys claims to have given Pope (via Oxford) some hints on Shakespeare. His duties for the earl prevented him from completing several biographical contributions to Birch's <span class="italic">General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</span> (1734&#150;1741), a deprivation of income he later resented. For Harley he attended auctions and sales and transcribed manuscripts for the collection, and had received some &pound;150 by 1739. He also organized Harley's vast collection of manuscript letters for binding, with abstracts and tables of contents. For these services he was paid a further &pound;200 a year until Harley's death in June 1741, a return which he seems to have regarded as inadequate, while acknowledging that he lived on exceptionally good terms with him:<blockquote>For the profit of about 500<i>l</i>. I devoted the best part of ten years' service to, and in his lordship's library; impoverished my own stores to enrich the same; disabled myself in my studies, and the advantages they might have produced from the publick; deserted the pursuits which might have obtained me a permanent accommodation; and procured the prejudice and misconceit of his lordship's surviving relations. (Yeowell, xx)</blockquote>Oldys's <span class="italic">British Librarian</span> had been published by Thomas Osborne, and it was Osborne who bought for &pound;13,000 Harley's collection of printed books, intending to dispose of them through an elaborate bibliographical catalogue to be edited by Samuel Johnson and Oldys. The first two volumes of <span class="italic">Catalogus Bibliothecae Harleianae</span> appeared on 12 March 1743, after some six months' work; the third and fourth volumes were published on 4 January 1744. The contributions of Johnson and Oldys are difficult to distinguish. Meanwhile, Osborne proposed (in terms provided by Johnson) a weekly subscription serial known as <span class="italic">The Harleian Miscellany</span>, which reprinted some of the scarcer tracts from the collection and which commenced in March 1744 with Oldys as its supervisory editor. It eventually ran to eight volumes (1744&#150;6). Alongside the <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> Oldys edited <span class="italic">A Copious and Exact Catalogue of Pamphlets in the Harleian Library</span>, which appeared piecemeal but eventually constituted a quarto volume of 168 pages, offering bibliographical descriptions of almost 550 items. Like many of Oldys's publications, this was valued highly by collectors and scholars, and several annotated copies exist.<br>
<br>Oldys provided a life of Thomas Moufet for a new edition of his <span class="italic">Health's Improvement</span>, published in 1745 by Osborne, but thereafter terminated their connection. He wrote the &#145;Historical essay&#146; which prefaces the edition of Michael Drayton's <span class="italic">Works</span> of 1748, and between 1747 and 1760 wrote some twenty-two articles for the first edition of the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, including lives of Edward Alleyn, Drayton, Sir George Etherege, and George Farquhar. His substantial accounts of Caxton, based on extensive examination of his output as a printer, of Sir John Fastolf (enlarged from an earlier contribution to the <span class="italic">General Dictionary</span>), and of Richard Hakluyt, were regarded as especially illuminating. Some authorities credit him with the co-editorship, with Joseph Towers, of the project as a whole. Oldys's manuscript notes on other figures (notably Arabella Stuart, John Barclay, Mary Beale, and Samuel Butler) were later bought by Thomas Cadell, one of the publishers of the second edition of <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, and heavily mined (with acknowledgement) by the editor, Andrew Kippis.<h2>
<a name="Norroykingatarmsandfinalyears"></a>Norroy king-at-arms and final years</h2>Despite his labours Oldys was unable to pay his rent in Gray's Inn and was confined to the Fleet prison. Surviving letters to Thomas Birch, dated 22 July 1751 and 23 August 1751, acknowledge helpful sums of money from Birch himself and from &#145;the Hon. Mr. Yorke&#146; through the agency of Mr Southwell, brother of the second Lord Southwell. His &#145;loitering, lingering, useless condition&#146;  (Yeowell, xxxiii) was ended when his debts were paid by his friends. One account states that Oldys wrote to the duke of Norfolk (Edward Howard, a friend of Harley's), who received the letter at dinner, read it out, and dispatched a messenger to give Oldys money and pay off his debts. Another version relates that the debts were paid by Southwell. The duke of Norfolk was certainly responsible for obtaining for Oldys the post of Norroy king-at-arms, to which he was appointed by patent on 5 May 1755, having previously, on 15 April, been created Norfolk herald-extraordinary at the College of Arms by the earl of Effingham in order to qualify for the office of Norroy. Oldys appointed Edward Orme of Chester as his deputy, and took up residence in the west wing of the College of Arms. There was apparently some resentment among the heralds at Oldys's rapid promotion to a provincial kingship, and malicious rumours were spread to the effect that Oldys was a Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>Two anecdotes indicate something of Oldys's duties during this period. In one story he tells how, having observed another herald correct himself during the reading of a proclamation and thus appear clumsy, when his own turn came &#145;he read on through thick and thin, never stopping a moment to correct his errors, and thereby excited the applause of the people&#146;, despite making more mistakes than his predecessor  (Taylor, 1.26). In the other, which apparently first appeared in the colourful sketch of Oldys in the <span class="italic">Olio</span> (1796) of the Richmond herald, Captain Francis Grose, Oldys is said to have been &#145;rarely sober in the afternoon, and never after supper&#146; and to have been so drunk at the funeral of Princess Caroline that the crown, which he was holding on a cushion, nearly fell off  (Noble, 420). Noble disputes this story on the grounds that at a royal funeral the crown should have been borne by Clarenceux, not Norroy, and Clarenceux is identified as the bearer in <span class="italic">The London Journal</span> of 5 January 1758 and in <span class="italic">Reed's Weekly Journal</span> of 7 January. Norroy had been the officer responsible at the funeral of Queen Caroline in 1737, however. Aside from official duties Oldys continued to collect and study books and manuscripts, furnishing a large upstairs room as a library. At one stage he reckoned his collection of historical and political pamphlets amounted to 5000 items. He wrote out scraps of information on slips of paper, classifying and sorting them into parchment bags for each biographical subject. Among these was Shakespeare, whose biography he had agreed to write for Walker, a bookseller, for 20 guineas (later reclaimed from his friend Taylor); his materials were used by Isaac Reed. He also made notes on Sir John Suckling, Aphra Behn (whose biography he had written in the <span class="italic">General Dictionary</span>), Edmund Spenser, John Milton, and John Dryden, including a memorandum to &#145;search the old papers in one of my large deal boxes for Mr. Dryden's letter of thanks to my father, for some communications relating to Plutarch&#146;  (Yeowell, 32). He visited archives and libraries throughout the capital, making notes on the provenance, prices, and fate of notable collections.<br>
<br>In 1753 Oldys had published <span class="italic">Observations on the Cure of William Taylor, the Blind Boy of Igtham, in Kent</span>, in collaboration with John Taylor, an oculist in London's Hatton Garden, who performed the cure. Taylor became Oldys's chief friend, and Oldys frequently passed evenings at Taylor's house. Oldys is said to have preferred the quiet of the fireside in the kitchen to more formal social gatherings, and Taylor's son records that he was so particular in his habits that he could not smoke his pipe with ease until his chair was fixed close to a particular crack in the floor. Oldys would not meet Taylor's father, Chevalier Taylor, until the latter sought him out, and spoke to him in Latin, whereupon the two men talked for several hours in that language. Grose relates, however, that Oldys had imbibed a taste for the company to be found in the Fleet prison, formed a &#145;Dragon Club&#146;, and used to drink with his companions &#145;the Rulers&#146; (because they lived within the rules of the prison) at The Bell in the Old Bailey, near the College of Arms, employing a watchman to get him home before midnight to avoid paying a fine. Grose says that Oldys's favourite drink was porter, washed down with gin.<br>
<br>Oldys's last biographical work was a life of Charles Cotton, prefixed to Sir John Hawkins's edition of Izaak Walton's <span class="italic">Compleat Angler</span> (1760). Oldys is praised by Grose for his &#145;great good-nature, honour, and integrity, particularly in his character as an historian&#146;, in which respect Grose thought him absolutely incorruptible  (Noble, 420). He appears to have had a loose connection with the Society of Antiquaries. He did not marry. He died at his rooms in the College of Arms at about 5 a.m. on 15 April 1761 and was buried on 19 April in the parish church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, towards the upper end of the north aisle. His age was given as seventy-two on the coffin, but he was actually not quite sixty-five. He died intestate. Administration of his property was granted to John Taylor, his friend and major creditor; Taylor paid for the funeral and took possession of Oldys's regalia, books, and manuscripts. Taylor was the owner of a painting of Oldys (looking well-fed and well-dressed), later engraved by Balston, with Oldys's own punning motto beneath:<blockquote>
<div>In word and <i>Will I am</i> a friend to you,<br>
</div>
<div>And one friend <i>Old is</i> worth a hundred new.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Oldys's printed books, including many with his habitual copious annotation, were sold with some of the manuscripts (and two other libraries) by Thomas Davies, beginning on 12 April 1762. Oldys had bought a second copy of Langbaine's <span class="italic">Account of the English Dramatick Poets</span> (1691) in 1727, and continued to annotate it marginally and interlinearly until he died; this copy was bought by Thomas Birch, who loaned it to Thomas Percy, who copied the notes into a further interleaved copy of Langbaine, from which Joseph Haslewood annotated his own copy. Steevens, Malone, and Reed also made copies of Oldys's notes. Birch eventually left the volume to the British Museum. Other annotated books included copies of <span class="italic">England's Parnassus</span>, Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>, John Philips's <span class="italic">Life of Milton</span>, William Nicolson's <span class="italic">English Scotch and Irish Historical Libraries</span>, and Thomas Fuller's <span class="italic">Worthies of England</span>, which Steevens bought. Among his manuscript collections were: a catalogue of materials relating to the history of London (used by Richard Gough in his <span class="italic">British Topography</span> of 1780); a series of remarks on the major institutional and private libraries in London and their catalogues (extending an earlier manuscript by John Bagford, and now in the Hunterian Collection, Glasgow); a catalogue of engraved portraits of national figures; &#145;Memoirs relating to the family of Oldys&#146; (BL, Add. MS 4240), of which a substantial portion relating to his father was published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1784 (volume 54); collections of data on English poets; commonplace books; and many observations on aspects of natural history. Taylor retained some manuscripts until Thomas Percy requested the loan of them; many were used by literary scholars and were gradually dispersed or acquired by institutions. While Oldys's own attempts at systematic study and publication petered out because of the magnitude of the tasks, his work was thus harnessed by writers such as Thomas Warton (in his <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span>) and Johnson (<span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>) into more literary and comprehensive form. Among more personal manuscript items are: his diary; a collection of poems; and materials for a work called <span class="italic">The patron, or, A portraiture of patronage and dependency, more especially as they appear in their domestick light and attitudes</span>, which perhaps indicates something of Oldys's feelings regarding his subservient position.<br>
