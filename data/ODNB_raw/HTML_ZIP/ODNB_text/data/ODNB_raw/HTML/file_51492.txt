<span class="headword">Brown,  Francis Charles Claypon  Yeats-</span>  (1886&#150;1944), <span class="occ">soldier and author</span>, was born on 15 August 1886 in Genoa, Italy, the third son of Montagu Yeats-Brown (1834&#150;1921), who was British consul-general in Genoa, and his wife, Agnes Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bellingham. He was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1904 he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was posted in 1906 to Bareilly, India, as a second lieutenant. In 1906 he was gazetted to the Bengal lancers and stationed in Bannu in the North-West Frontier Province. While he enjoyed the danger of skirmishes with the tribesmen and the camaraderie of regimental life, he was fascinated by India itself. He saw it as &#145;avid for life and colour and gaiety, yet preserving always a sense of a world unseen&#146;  (Yeats-Brown, <span class="italic">Indian Pageant</span>, 290), and he began a search for teachers who could give him an understanding of Hinduism's spiritual practices and beliefs.<br>
<br>In 1907 Yeats-Brown was posted to the 17th cavalry of the Indian army and made adjutant in 1913. He went on leave to England in 1914, joined the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, and served for six months in France before being sent to Mesopotamia, where he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps with the rank of captain. He was captured by the Turks in 1915 near Baghdad, and after a number of attempts to escape, one time disguising himself as a woman, he finally got away in 1918. His first book, <span class="italic">Caught by the Turks</span> (1919) was a light-hearted, but graphic, account of the miseries of Turkish prisons. Surrounded by &#145;dirt and drunkenness, savagery and stupidity&#146;, he used yogic practice to become &#145;poised and relaxed and completely in my body&#146;  (Yeats-Brown, <span class="italic">Bengal Lancer</span>, 197&#150;9). Awarded the DFC, he returned to India as a major, and retired from the army in 1924.<br>
<br>From 1925 to 1928, Yeats-Brown was assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, but what brought him literary fame was the publication in 1930 of <span class="italic">Bengal Lancer</span>, which went through many editions in both Great Britain and the United States, and won the James Tait Black memorial prize. Much of the book consists of episodes and anecdotes about Yeats-Brown's life in the Bengal lancers, interspersed with colourful descriptions of the author's travels throughout India. What attracted many readers, however, was the quality that led Rabindranath Tagore to describe it as unmatched as &#145;a genuine psychological record of an intimate touch of a western mind with the mind of the east&#146;  (<span class="italic">Book Review Digest</span>, 1930, 1153). Some reviewers, however, while praising his accounts of army life and the Indian scene, were displeased with what seemed fulsome praise of Indian spirituality: &#145;if the triumph of man's spiritual achievement be the perception that all is one, that god and man are confounded in a cosmic process, to some this will seem a dismal triumph&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>). The Hollywood film company Paramount bought the rights to the book before it was published; but the very popular film that was made (in 1935), using the book's American title <span class="italic">The Lives of a Bengal Lancer</span>, with such famous actors as Gary Cooper and C. Aubrey Smith, was not really based on the book. The success of the book led Yeats-Brown to revise <span class="italic">Caught by the Turks</span>, with new background on the last decade of Ottoman rule; he published it in 1932 as <span class="italic">Golden Horn</span> and in the United States as <span class="italic">Bloody Years</span>. In 1934 he turned his attention to the issue of Britain's military preparedness. Angered by the success of Beverly Nichols's pacifist book, <span class="italic">Cry Havoc!</span> (1933), which he felt showed the failure of the British to see the dangers of pacifism, he wrote a reply called <span class="italic">The Dogs of War!</span> in 1934. Some of its themes were expanded in <span class="italic">European Jungle</span> in 1939 but its antisemitism, coupled with arguments in support of Hitler and Mussolini, brought deserved criticism from reviewers in both Britain and the United States.<br>
<br>Yeats-Brown continued to explore Indian themes in <span class="italic">Lancer at Large</span>, published in 1937, which covered much of the same ground as <span class="italic">Bengal Lancer</span>. But his comments on Indian politics show little awareness of the forces that were to challenge his belief that British rule would continue in India. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Yoga Explained</span>, one of the earliest attempts to popularize yoga in the West as beneficial to both physical and spiritual health. It has pictures of him standing on his head and in other yogic poses. He lectured in Europe and the United States on India, yoga, and religion.<br>
<br>Yeats-Brown remained single until 1938 when he married Olga, widow of Denzil Phillips, and daughter of Colonel Apollon Zoueff. During and after the Second World War, he collaborated with E. W. Sheppard in compiling five volumes with texts and pictures on the record of the British army from 1939 to 1942 (published 1943&#150;7). He continued to write on India, and <span class="italic">Indian Pageant</span>, published in 1942, emphasizes the splendour of India's spiritual and intellectual achievements. He appeared on BBC radio programmes on Indian themes, notably a series in 1941 called <span class="italic">Gods, Saints, and Heroes of Hindustan</span>. <span class="italic">Martial India</span> (1945), his last book, published posthumously, is an affectionate picture of the Indian army, but has little historical depth. While generally well reviewed none of those books on India achieved the popularity of <span class="italic">Bengal Lancer</span>.<br>
<br>Yeats-Brown died of heart failure at 38 Cheriston Gardens, Kensington, London, on 19 December 1944, his wife surviving him. His funeral was at Golders Green crematorium on 23 December, and a memorial service was held at Grosvenor Chapel on 28 December, where he was praised for his patriotism, courage, and love of India. While his reputation was diminished by his political views, his books remain very readable and provide interesting insights into British attitudes between the two world wars.<br>
