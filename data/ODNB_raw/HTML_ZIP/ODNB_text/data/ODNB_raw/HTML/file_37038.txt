<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wright,  Robert Alderson</span>, Baron Wright  (1869&#150;1964), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 15 October 1869 at South Shields, co. Durham, the son of John Wright, marine superintendent, and his wife, Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of John Carr, of Shields. Little is known about Wright's background, but he lived with his mother until she died. Sources refer to him as being educated privately but it is not known what he did in his late teens and early twenties, although at one point he was a schoolmaster and he probably worked with his father. At the age of twenty-four he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class in both parts of the classical tripos in 1895&#150;6 and part two of the moral sciences tripos in 1897. In 1899 he won a prize fellowship at Trinity, which paid him &pound;200 a year for six years and enabled him to be called to the bar in 1900, at the ripe age, for those days, of thirty-one. After the death of his mother Wright married in 1928 Marjory Avis Bullows (<i>d</i>. 1980), an accomplished horsewoman and master of the Tedworth hounds. They had no children.<br>
<br>In understanding Wright there are a number of influences to consider. It is almost certain that he had absorbed a good sense of commercial practice from his father and his early years of work. Second, his pupillage was at the commercial bar and he entered the chambers of Thomas Scrutton who was the leader of the commercial bar, which had been reinvigorated by the establishment of the commercial court (or list) in the 1890s. Although not an easy man, Scrutton was a superb commercial lawyer. He was also, for a practitioner, remarkably thoughtful on the issue of the public role of the courts, and he was concerned about how the law approached social issues. Wright's exposure to such social issues was further enhanced by his appointment as lecturer in industrial law at the newly founded London School of Economics. By the time he reached his thirties, therefore, Wright, in comparison with his peers, had been more exposed to academic law, the interaction of law and social policy, and the role of law in commercial life.<br>
<br>Despite these advantages&#151;if such they were&#151;Wright's practice developed slowly, even by the slow standards of the commercial bar in those days. After ten years at the bar his practice was so modest that he considered becoming a full-time academic. It was, however, a time when Europe was gearing up for war, and suddenly shipping cases boomed. Within one year, Wright's practice went from &pound;300 per annum to &pound;3000 per annum. His career was launched. When war broke out in 1914 he was already forty-five, and so entitled to remain at the bar, rather than enlist. The First World War was especially lucrative for the commercial bar. Wright became an expert in war risk insurance and was in constant demand. By 1917 he had taken silk.<br>
<br>Wright was no flamboyant advocate at a time when that was thought to be an asset. He was seen as primarily a presenter of facts and arguer of law. If prolix, he was persuasive, and his success grew. In 1925, at the age of fifty-six, he was appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court and given the customary knighthood. He might have remained there or joined Scrutton in the Court of Appeal, had it not been for the lord chancellorship of Lord Sankey. Sankey was attempting to raise the quality of the judiciary, and particularly that in the final appeal court, the House of Lords. The late twenties had been a period of the retirement of the high tory law lords Atkinson, Carson, and Sumner, and the Liberal Shaw. Lord Cave (1924&#150;8) and Lord Hailsham (1928&#150;9), the Conservative lord chancellors, began depoliticization. In a remarkable move, Sankey (lord chancellor, 1929&#150;35) completed the professionalization process in 1932 by translating Wright directly from the King's Bench Division to the House of Lords, without the intervening step of the Court of Appeal. Wright remained a lord of appeal in ordinary (a law lord) until 1947, although he agreed to serve as the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal (the master of the rolls) from 1935 to 1937.<br>
<br>Wright was one of the few significant British appeal judges of the twentieth century. To understand his contribution, however, one has to realize that legal fashions change, and for two decades after his retirement Wright's style of judging and his broad progressive approach to law were out of fashion. At the bar in the fifties and sixties it was said &#145;cite Wright, but follow Atkin&#146; (the latter being Lord Atkin of Aberdovey). This trend was consolidated by Lord Jowitt (Labour lord chancellor, 1945&#150;51) and by Lord Simonds (Conservative lord chancellor, 1951&#150;4). They used their formalistic approach to law to attempt to downplay the work of Wright. Thus, for many years, Wright lived in the shadow of Atkin although, in the last twenty-five years, with the return of a more progressive and purposive approach to law, the importance of Wright as a remarkable appeal judge has been appreciated.<br>
<br>In some areas it is true that Wright was overshadowed by Atkin. Wright did not deliver judgments (speeches) as famous as that of Atkin's in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>  (1932). Yet Wright was responsible for providing the system of assessing damages in the new tort of negligence: &#145;The law cannot take account of everything that follows a wrongful act&#146;  (<i>The Liesbosch v. The Edison</i>, 1933), while at the same time underlining that the new tort was indeed totally separate from contract:<blockquote>Now that the forms of action have been abolished and it is recognised that negligence is an independent tort, it is not necessary to consider if the duty is to be based on contract or whether it is based simply on the relationship between the parties. (<i>Lindsey County Council v. Marshall</i>, 1936)</blockquote>Wright's greatest contribution in tort, however, reflected his interest in protecting working men. He greatly restructured the nineteenth-century doctrine of common employment, while insisting that employers were under a duty to provide a safe system of work, independent of any liability under the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Acts</span>:<blockquote>What is all important is to adapt the standard of what is negligent to the facts, and to give due regard to the actual conditions under which men work in a factory or mine, at the long hours and the fatigue, to the slackening of attention which naturally comes from constant repetition of the same operation, to the noise and confusion in which the man works, to his preoccupation in what he is actually doing at the cost perhaps of some inattention to his own safety. (<i>Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company v. English</i>, 1937)</blockquote>It was, however, in the area of contract and commercial law that, not surprisingly, Wright came into his own. He advanced the position, so alien to the formalists, that it was unreasonable to expect to develop principles of contract which applied to all factual situations  (<i>Luxor (Eastborne) Ltd v. Cooper</i>, 1940). He pioneered a more flexible approach to the interpretation of contract: &#145;the duty of the court is to construe such documents fairly and broadly, without being too astute or subtle in finding defects&#146;  (<i>Hillas &amp; Co. v. Arcos</i>, 1932). His linking of commercial law and practice covered such areas as misrepresentation  (<i>Spense v. Crawford</i>, 1939) but, perhaps most significantly, the principles of frustration of contract, so essential for a period of international tension and conflict. His approach could not have been more flexible:<blockquote>in ascertaining the meaning of the contract and its application to the actual occurrences, the court has to decide not what the parties actually intended, but what as reasonable men they should have intended. The court personifies for this purpose the reasonable man. (<i>Joseph Constantine SS Line Ltd v. Imperial Smelting Corporation</i>, 1941)</blockquote>It was this commercial and reasonable approach to contract law that so offended the high priests of formalism in the late forties and fifties.In no area was Wright more underestimated than in public law. Civil libertarians have tended to look down on him because he was in the majority in <i>Liversidge v. Anderson</i>  (1941), while Atkin dissented over the suspension of habeas corpus. Wright's explanation, however, was that the Birkett committee (advising the home secretary on cases of detention under the emergency powers) provided a more effective protection than the courts, and he was perhaps right. Certainly his broad approach to statutory interpretation made him a better constitutional lawyer than his peers. In the disastrous decision of the judicial committee of the privy council in <i>Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario</i>  (1937), where a panel chaired by Lord Atkin struck down the Canadian New Deal, including the federal social security system and the minimum wage, as he later admitted, Wright dissented. (At that time dissents could not be recorded publicly.) The dissent was appropriate; Atkin's decision led to Canada's decision to abandon appeals to London. Wright made it clear that he was of the same mind as Sankey that a constitution had to be treated as a &#145;living tree&#146;, while Atkin's &#145;watertight compartments&#146; were alien to him. It was no doubt this same innate political sense that led Wright to take the law out of efforts to browbeat unions through the tort of conspiracy in <i>Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co. v. Veitch</i>  (1942).<br>
<br>Wright's approach to law was complemented by his other public duties. During the 1930s he chaired Lord Sankey's Law Revision Committee. His work signified a new approach to law reform. In 1945 he became chair of the United Nations War Crimes Commission, charged with collecting the material for the Nuremberg trials. In 1946 he was treasurer of the Inner Temple. In 1947 he retired as a law lord, and in 1948 was made GCMG. He returned to his house in the Savernake Forest in Wiltshire, at Durley, where he maintained a rigorous schedule of riding until, at the age of ninety, he was injured in a car accident. He died at his home, Durley House, Burbage, Wiltshire, on 27 June 1964.<br>
