<span class="headword">Turnbull,  Hugh</span>  (<em>b. </em>1517, <em>d.</em> in or before 1566), <span class="occ">dean of Chichester and administrator</span>, was from Lincolnshire, born to an unknown family. He was admitted <i>discipulus</i> of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 27 April 1532, probationary fellow on 10 January 1536, and fellow in 1538; he remained a fellow until 1543. His logic lectures, begun in 1535, attracted complaints to Archbishop Cranmer. Turnbull took the degrees of BA in 1536 and MA on 31 March 1539. Ordained subdeacon on 18 December 1540 and deacon on 12 March 1541, he took priest's orders on 2 April 1541 to the title of his fellowship. He was admitted BTh in 1545 and matriculated at Louvain on 12 July 1547. In 1551 he received his DTh degree from the University of Padua by grant from the count palatine Transalgardo Capoditista, using an imperial privilege; this allowed him to avoid swearing an oath to the pope.<br>
<br>Turnbull tutored at Padua in both humanities and civil law, although he never took a degree in law. The civilians John Tregonwell and Anthony Hussey were his patrons, and he may have studied under or at least known the eminent legist Marco Mantova Benavides, since he wrote to Cardinal Pole the day after Mantova did in March 1555 congratulating him on the reconciliation of England and sending some lost questions on scripture, judged &#145;papistical&#146; by the Stuart antiquary Brian Twyne. Turnbull had long been a successful pluralist by this time. He was rector of Acton, Middlesex, from 7 May 1542 (vacated by 1563) and of Batcombe, Somerset, from 6 April 1547 (vacated by December 1564); canon of Canterbury and ninth prebendary by royal nomination (30 March 1554; admitted 6 April until death); dean of Chichester from 27 April 1558 (until death); and canon of Salisbury and prebendary of South Grantham from 14 July 1562 (until death) by the patronage of Thomas Lodge and Benjamin Jonson, executors of Hussey's will.<br>
<br>Turnbull's appointment to Chichester may well have been an effort to resolve persistent difficulties in the finances of the see, drawing on experience gained as treasurer and prebendary of Christ Church Cathedral (by 1557). He was first dispensed to hold an additional benefice on 25 February 1547, and by the pope for non-residence at an unknown date and on 5 July 1555 to hold incompatible benefices. Cardinal Pole named him a commissioner against heresy in the diocese of Canterbury on 28 March 1558 and occasionally used him as his proctor at Canterbury. Archbishop Parker had him excommunicated for contumacy at his visitation on 17 September 1560, but he was absolved on 9 October.<br>
<br>Turnbull was dead by 21 November 1566, when his will was proved, although records at Chichester give the date of his death as 23 November. By it he left bedding to a large number of servants: William Fells, Richard Lane, John Brewer, Thomas Bowser, John Milles (perhaps a relative of Turnbull's fellow canon of Canterbury of the same name), and Thomas Raddish. 40 marks went to his nephew George Turnbull, and the residue of his estate to other nephews at Canterbury and Oxford; his sister was to have a similar portion. Lawrence Hussey (probably the son of Anthony Hussey the civilian), Turnbull's brother William, and William Cauthant, the husband of his sister's daughter, were named executors. He also gave a copy of Basil's <span class="italic">Opera</span> (Venice, 1535) to Corpus Christi College, the edition in which Pole's household had been involved.<br>
