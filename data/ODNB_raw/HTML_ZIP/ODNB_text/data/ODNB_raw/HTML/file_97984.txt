<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Caminada,  Jerome</span>  (1844&#150;1914), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at 33 Peter Street, Manchester, on 15 March 1844, the third son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Francis Caminada (<i>d</i>. 1847), a cabinet maker originally from Lombardy, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyle, who was of Irish descent. Other members of the Caminada family were makers of barometers and scientific instruments. The family worshipped at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Mulberry Street, Manchester; later, as a detective, Caminada would meet his informants on the back pews of the church. After attending St Mary's Catholic School, he worked in local iron foundries.<br>
<br>Aged twenty-three, Caminada joined the Manchester city police force on 20 February 1868, when he was described as five feet eight inches in height, with a fresh complexion, grey eyes and brown hair. He started as a beat constable in the town centre or A division. In 1871 he was promoted sergeant, and transferred to the detective department, which was then part of the non-territorial E division. Based at headquarters in the basement of Manchester town hall, members of E division often rubbed shoulders with senior officers and promotion was held to be more rapid once one &#145;went indoors&#146;. He married, on 19 December 1881, at the church of the Holy Name, Chorlton upon Medlock, Amelia (1855&#150;1928), daughter of Joseph Wainhouse, weaver. For some years after their marriage he and his wife lived with his mother-in-law, Mary Wainhouse, at 22 Eastnor Street, Stretford. They had five children, three of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1882 Caminada was promoted detective inspector, and in 1884 he was made chief detective inspector. He was appointed superintendent of E division on 2 December 1897. Leading the Manchester city police detective department, he became the city's most celebrated detective, and gained a national reputation for his police work. He learned to move effectively through all levels of the highly stratified society of Victorian Manchester, from interviewing a company director about alleged embezzlement to getting information at an illegal bare-knuckle boxing match. He developed an extraordinary memory for faces and became adept at disguises. On one occasion, his foot swathed in bandages, he pretended to have gout so he could obtain some patent medicine from a quack doctor practising fraudulently in Manchester. He also possessed physical courage and could tackle the toughest of criminals. On the trail of a violent burglar whom he had locked up on many previous occasions, Caminada, disguised as a workman, leapt on his prey, one Bob Horridge, as the latter emerged from a public house. Greeting the burglar with a cheery &#145;Hello Bob!&#146; Caminada grasped him in a desperate bear hug in order to prevent him from drawing the loaded gun that he habitually carried in his coat pocket. Caminada himself was authorized to carry a pistol when he deemed it necessary. During his career he received awards from the Manchester watch committee as well as from banks after he had solved cases of fraud and forgery. He was reckoned to have brought about the imprisonment of over 1100 criminals, testimony in part to his care in preparing his cases meticulously when they came to trial. Much of his achievement was associated with his work in &#145;cleaning up&#146; Deansgate in central Manchester. He regarded beer houses as centres of vice and claimed to have been responsible for suppressing 400 of them, and was also involved in campaigns against betting dens and brothels.<br>
<br>Caminada was unusual as an outsider, from an Irish Catholic background, who rose through the ranks of the Manchester police. His origins heightened his awareness of the problems of poverty, and concern with the rehabilitation of criminals. While still a serving officer he published details of his police work in <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Years of Detective Life</span> (1895), describing over fifty cases in which he had been involved. A second volume appeared in 1901, and highlighted the international scope of his counter-terrorist investigations. On one occasion he shadowed Fenian nationalist suspects from Manchester to Paris and in another case followed a man from England to the United States, back to England and then to Ireland, where he kept him under observation for a further two months, noting whom he met, until the suspect returned to the United States.<br>
<br>Caminada retired on 31 March 1899 and received a pension of &pound;210 a year. He and his wife lived in Whitworth Park, Moss Side, Manchester, where he owned houses and was an estate agent and active member of the ratepayers' association. Standing as an independent candidate for Openshaw, with an anti-socialist manifesto, he was elected to Manchester city council in 1907, but lost the seat in 1910 on the returning officer's casting vote. Seriously injured in a charabanc accident in north Wales in 1912, he never fully recovered and died from influenza, but with underlying diabetes and heart disease, at his home, 2 Mount St Bernard, Denmark Road, Whitworth Park, Manchester, on 10 March 1914. His wife, a son, and a daughter survived him. His funeral took place at the southern cemetery, Manchester, and a requiem mass was held at the church of the Holy Name. In tribute Judge Edward Parry f&ecirc;ted Caminada as &#145;The Garibaldi of Detectives&#146;  (Hewitt, 90). An enduring tale told by the Manchester police themselves was of a well-known prostitute seen on the fringes of Caminada's funeral, wearing a red dress, perhaps a silent triumphant comment that the man who had done so much to change the criminal haunts of old Manchester had finally been laid to rest.<br>
