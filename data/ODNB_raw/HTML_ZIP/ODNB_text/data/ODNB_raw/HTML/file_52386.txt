<span class="headword">McLean,  David</span>  (1833&#150;1908), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 4 February 1833 at Scotswalls Farm, Crossgates, near Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, the fifth of the six children of James McLean (1791&#150;1851), farmer, and his wife, Isabel (1790&#150;1882), daughter of James Pettie and his wife, Jannet Reddie. As the son of a poor farmer, McLean's early education was erratic, but he became apprenticed to William Beveridge, manager of the Dunfermline branch of the Western Bank of Scotland, from whom he learned his banking and with whom he established a lasting personal relationship. When the Western Bank failed in 1857, McLean determined to follow his elder brother to New Zealand. On reaching London, however, he checked with the Oriental Bank Corporation (then the most important British overseas bank), to which he had written previously, and learned that a position in India or China had just been offered him. Abandoning his plans (and passage money), he accepted the China offer and, after training, went east to Hong Kong, where in 1862 he became acting manager. Transferred to Shanghai, he became acting manager of that branch in 1864.<br>
<br>The promoters of the Hongkong Bank were impressed by McLean and attempted to poach him, but he initially could not be tempted. Months later, however, McLean, convinced that he would not be confirmed manager by the Oriental Bank, applied to become, and in 1865 was appointed as, the Hongkong Bank's first Shanghai manager. There, he was particularly successful, both professionally and personally. The board of directors offered McLean the chief managership of the bank in 1870, but he considered managing the Shanghai branch of virtually equal importance.<br>
<br>Despite sending regular remittances to support his mother and other members of his family, McLean had been able to save &pound;50,000, and in 1873 he returned to Britain, accepting the sub-managership of the bank's London office. Within a few months he had uncovered improper transactions by the manager; and in consequence McLean was appointed to replace him. In 1874 he returned to Scotland to marry Elizabeth Livingston (1852&#150;1929), daughter of John Manson, banker, of Fingask, and Elizabeth Livingston Blaikie, and sister of Sir Patrick Manson. The McLeans had four children.<br>
<br>By 1874 the Hongkong Bank was in difficulty, and McLean was once again offered the top executive position. Now fully settled in London, he declined, but agreed to act as inspector to reassure shareholders. In this he was successful, and was able to ensure that his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Thomas Jackson, became the new chief manager. McLean continued to act as virtual tutor, not only to Jackson but also to other, more isolated, managers; and the surviving correspondence constitutes a major source for an understanding of the intricacies of exchange banking. In addition, McLean had a positive effect on recruitment policy. Banks on the China coast had on occasion employed local &#145;Europeans&#146; with dangerously mixed results; but McLean developed a &#145;service&#146; of young British staff, trained in London and sent east as needed, with the intention of lifetime careers with the bank.<br>
<br>The Scottish McLean was in no way awed by the City of London and its financial institutions. The Hongkong Bank acted from time to time as agent for the Chinese government, and McLean in 1874 successfully introduced the first public China loan on the London market. With the advice of the London and County Bank, and through Panmure Gordon &amp; Co., McLean gained confidence. In 1885, during the Sino-French War, the Hongkong Bank was prepared to act as agent for the Chinese 6 per cent gold loan of &pound;757,000. Barings, and Matheson &amp; Co., were also agents for a second loan; intent on retaining market control, they urged McLean to permit them to issue both, but without mention of the Hongkong Bank. After obtaining authority from head office, McLean refused. Quietly, he had prepared his own prospectus; it was ready for mailing, and the Hongkong Bank's loan was, in fact, oversubscribed. In 1887 McLean turned down a proposal from Rothschild's that the Hongkong Bank join with a German group, but the concept was in any case premature. McLean would first establish his bank's independence and prove its capabilities. This in turn would provide the experience and credibility necessary for its later key role in China's public borrowing.<br>
<br>In 1889 McLean retired from the London management to make way for the return&#151;temporary as it turned out&#151;of Thomas Jackson, accepting instead membership of the bank's London consultative committee. McLean had been an expert witness before the royal commission on gold and silver in 1886, but he now seriously underestimated the long-run weakness of silver by accepting a directorship in the newly formed Trust and Loan Company of China, Japan, and the Straits, a company established to finance China's anticipated modernization. Suitable projects did not materialize; the company, with its funds in the East, speculated as silver continued its fall. As the company did not itself operate in the London&#150;China exchanges, McLean, although remaining on the Hongkong Bank's London Committee, saw no conflict of interest, but in 1893 the Trust and Loan Company, reorganized as the Bank of China, Japan, and the Straits, changed policy. McLean, deciding that his honour required his remaining with the failing enterprise, severed all connections with the Hongkong Bank.<br>
<br>In 1889 there were two innovative companies with complementary products&#151;the financially liquid Lamson Store Service Company, and the expanding, but capital-short Paragon Check Book Company. The chairman of Lamson, John M. Kelly, had known David McLean in the East and now sought his advice. Together they obtained a majority interest in Paragon, and in 1889 established through merger the Lamson Paragon Supply Company Ltd, with a registered capital of &pound;30,000. McLean was a director until his resignation in 1907, by which time the company had become a successful multinational with a capital of &pound;400,000; his son Alan became chairman in 1912.<br>
<br>David McLean remained a director of the Imperial Bank of Persia and a successful venture capitalist, with interests in rubber and tin. An enthusiastic sportsman, he rented in 1884 a shooting estate, Littlewood Park, above Kirkton of Forbes, near Alford, Aberdeenshire, where he was noted for his prizewinning herd of Aberdeen cattle. He retired there, and he died on 18 June 1908 at Littlewood Park. He was buried in the cemetery of Kirkton of Forbes.<br>
<br>David McLean was one of the most important overseas bankers of his generation. As Shanghai manager, first of the Oriental Bank Corporation and then of the newly established Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, McLean successfully developed the techniques of exchange banking and related trade finance in the most commercially important &#145;treaty port&#146; on the China coast. On return to London as manager for the Hongkong Bank, he proved that the bank, although based in Hong Kong, was competent to act as agent for the issue of Chinese government loans. His system of executive staff recruitment for service in the East was an influential model, which prevailed at least until the 1950s. By the time of his retirement the Hongkong Bank had become the largest British overseas bank.<br>
