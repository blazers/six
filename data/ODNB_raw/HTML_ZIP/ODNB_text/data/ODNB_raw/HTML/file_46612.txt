<span class="headword">Beckett <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Beckett Denison]</span>,  Rupert Evelyn</span>  (1870&#150;1955), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 2 November 1870 at Meanwood Park, Chapel Allerton, near Leeds, the third son of <a name="cosubject_48805"></a><span class="headword">William Beckett</span>  (1826&#150;1890), <span class="occ">banker and politician</span>, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duncombe, third daughter of the second Baron Feversham. Rupert was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57573/', "Sir Edmund Beckett, fourth baronet (1787&#150;1874)")</script>. When, in 1814, Edmund married the great-great-niece and heir of Sir Thomas Denison (1699&#150;1765), a judge in the king's bench, he added Denison to his surname, but he resumed his patronymic when he succeeded to the baronetcy in 1872. His third son, William Beckett Denison, followed his example only in 1886 (when he chose to be called William Beckett).<br>
<br>By the 1860s the Becketts of Leeds were prominent north-country bankers of a century's standing. In this and the following decade they acquired a number of well-established banks elsewhere in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire to extend their business beyond the wool textile region. Two of these were in the rich agricultural area around Malton (Bower, Hall &amp; Co., acquired in 1875) and York (Swann, Clough &amp; Co., in 1879). In 1879 they were formed into Beckett &amp; Co., the York and East Riding Bank. William Beckett Denison became the bank's managing partner, grandly renting Nun Appleton Hall near York for his residence. He later became president of the Country Banker's Association. He was MP for East Retford, 1876&#150;80, and for Bassetlaw, 1885&#150;90.<br>
<br>His marriage, in 1855, allowed him to straddle the world of the Yorkshire aristocracy and that of his own plutocratic banking and railway-promoting circle. William Beckett was killed by a passing train while walking along the track at Wimborne, Dorset, on 23 November 1890. He was survived by his wife. His sons all achieved eminence in Yorkshire affairs. The eldest, Ernest William (1856&#150;1917), MP for the Whitby division of the county from 1885 to 1905, succeeded his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30665/', "Edmund Beckett (1816&#150;1905)")</script> as second Baron Grimthorpe in 1905; the second, Sir Gervase Beckett (1866&#150;1937), was MP for several Yorkshire constituencies between 1906 and 1929.<br>
<br>Rupert, the third and youngest, was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was destined to carry on the family's great banking tradition, becoming a partner on leaving Cambridge. Having completed his apprenticeship in Leeds, he became resident managing partner of the Doncaster branch (formerly Cooke, Yarborough &amp; Co., acquired in 1868). An officer in the Yorkshire hussars, he built up for himself a first-rate reputation as a businessman in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He became a director of two important companies, the Great Northern Railway (of which his grandfather had been a principal promoter, ensuring that the route from London to York did not bypass Doncaster) and the Aire and Calder Navigation Company. On 21 December 1896 Beckett married Muriel Helen Florence (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of Lord Berkeley Paget, and the couple had four daughters.<br>
<br>Around 1910 Beckett moved to Leeds and became deeply involved in its affairs. He was nominated a director of the Yorkshire Penny Bank on its reconstruction by Sir Edward Holden and of the Yorkshire Conservative Newspaper Company in 1911, holding both appointments for forty-four years. During the First World War he was an active member of the directing board of a munitions factory in Leeds, and in 1918 sat on the Treasury committee on bank amalgamations. Three years later, and by this time senior partner, he carefully steered Becketts, with its thirty-seven branches, assets of over &pound;12 million, and status as one of the last two private note-issuing banks in England, into a merger with one of the &#145;big five&#146; banks&#151;the Westminster. Becketts brought to the new bank, which as a result of earlier amalgamations already possessed good bases in London, the west country, the east midlands and the north-west, a strong presence east of the Pennines. Rupert and his brother Gervase became main board directors.<br>
<br>A decade later, reversing usual practice, Rupert Beckett, the representative of an acquired subsidiary, became chairman of the Westminster Bank in 1931&#151;not a propitious year in which to assume a senior banking post. As chairman for twenty years, he guided the bank's affairs &#145;with complete reliability and with sturdy Yorkshire good sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 April 1955). Another <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent (3 May 1955) thought him &#145;a giant amongst bankers&#146;, while the &#145;Men and Matters&#146; column in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> (quoted in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, 27 April 1955) maintained that he &#145;was outstandingly the best British Banker of this century&#146;. Certainly, during his chairmanship the bank's assets grew from &pound;300 million to over &pound;800 million and its branch network was sensibly extended. In 1947 he became chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers and of the British Bankers' Association. Aged eighty, he retired as chairman of the Westminster Bank in 1950, though he continued as a board member until 1955, attending a meeting only a few days before his death.<br>
<br>Rupert Beckett was a big man, with a high-pitched laugh; he was modest, generous, and well liked. He hid a decisive financial brain behind a genial exterior. Reckoned to be a good judge of character, he enjoyed a game of bridge and golf and the smart house parties of the inter-war years; he liked to entertain his friends at York and Doncaster races. Above all, however, he possessed a great sense of duty. Operating easily in metropolitan social and banking circles, he was nevertheless most at home in Leeds. He was a great fosterer of Yorkshire industry; he held a formidable string of offices in Leeds, of which he was a freeman from 1931. He was treasurer of the university for more than thirty years, of the chamber of commerce and of the Leeds Club.<br>
<br>Beckett's chief interest after banking was newspapers. Associated with the company which produced the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>&#151;the Conservative voice of the county&#151;Beckett served as its chairman for more than thirty years, and guided its finances wisely, while preserving its editorial freedom. A true Conservative in the long tradition of the Becketts, he was a JP and a deputy lieutenant of the West Riding. But with a father, an uncle, and two brothers in the House of Commons, he himself declined entering parliament, preferring to concentrate upon his banking and business interests.<br>
<br>Beckett died on 25 April 1955 at his apartment in the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly, London. His wife had pre-deceased him in 1941. He was cremated at Golders Green on 28 April and his ashes interred at Acaster Selby, Yorkshire, on 1 May.<br>
