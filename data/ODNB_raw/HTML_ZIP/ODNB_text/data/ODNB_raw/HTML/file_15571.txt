<span class="headword">King,  John</span>, first Baron Kingston  (<em>c.</em>1620&#150;1676), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15593/', "Sir Robert King (d. 1657)")</script> and his first wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Sir Henry Folliott, first baron of Ballyshannon, and his wife, Anne Strode. When Sir Robert went to England in 1642 after the outbreak of the Irish rising he left John in command of Boyle Castle, co. Roscommon. In the late 1640s King joined his father in London, where he sought to recruit a regiment, but it was as major in Richard Coote's horse regiment that he was active in the last years of the war in Ireland. He gained fame for his capture of the general of the Ormondist army, Heber Macmahon, the Roman Catholic bishop of Clogher, after its defeat at Scarrifhollis on 21 June 1650; he was present at the siege of Charlemont two months later, and served as parliamentary commissioner in the conclusion of both the articles of Galway on 5 April 1652 and the articles with Clanricarde on 28 June 1652. After the war he served as commissioner for setting out lands to the soldiers in Sligo. During the 1650s King and his father bought a large number of transplantation certificates and soldiers' debentures. King himself purchased substantial estates in co. Dublin from the adventurer John Blackwell, while his marriage, in 1657, to Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Sir William Fenton, brought him the Munster lands of the white knights, including Mitchelstown Castle, to which she was heir. Henry Cromwell knighted him on 7 June 1658 and two days later recommended that he be appointed to succeed his father as muster-master general, observing that &#145;he is a person of no less meritt than his father, being grown a very serious, and, I hope, religious man&#146;  (Thurloe, 7.162).<br>
<br>After the fall of the protectorate King became deeply involved in the moves towards the restoration of Charles II. He had taken up a regimental command in the remodelled Irish army by February 1660, represented Boyle in the general convention which assembled in March, and was one of the four men in Ireland to be favoured with a personal letter of encouragement from Charles. He was chosen to present General Monck with the humble address of 8 May in which the army in Ireland welcomed the Restoration and was appointed one of the convention's commissioners to attend King Charles. He was knighted on 5 June 1660 and on 4 September both ennobled as Baron Kingston and sworn of the Irish privy council. He was appointed a member of the presidency council of Connaught on 17 March 1661 and nominated two days later to the commission which was intended to execute the provisions of the king's &#145;gracious declaration&#146; of November 1660. Though the commission proved abortive, Kingston's interests were carefully protected in the parliamentary arrangements which replaced it. He benefited from a proviso in the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> in 1662, was one of twenty-two individuals who were declared exempt from the obligation to retrench a third of their estates in the <span class="roman">Act of Explanation</span> in 1665, and secured recognition of his claim as a '49 officer (one owed payment for services prior to 1649). He was appointed commissary-general on 11 May 1661, given the captaincy of a troop on 15 November, and made colonel of a horse regiment on 20 April 1667. On 2 April 1666, on Ormond's urging, he was joined with John, Lord Berkeley, as president of Connaught, an arrangement which lasted until the abolition of the office in 1672 when both men were allowed to retain the fees and profits of the post and Berkeley was granted a pension with reversion to Kingston.<br>
<br>Kingston's last years were occupied in securing ratification of the complex arrangements he had made to acquire reprisal lands (property surrendered to compensate other claimants) to make up his full entitlement under the settlement. A favourable recommendation by arbiters was approved by Ormond and accepted by Kingston, and on 9 March 1676 the king ordered that he should be excepted from the stop recently placed on the disposal of reprisal lands and that the transaction should be completed. Kingston died within days, in March 1676, and the instruction was renewed for his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15595/', "Robert King, second Baron Kingston (c.1660&#150;1693)")</script>, on 10 April. Kingston's younger son John succeeded as third baron in 1693.<br>
