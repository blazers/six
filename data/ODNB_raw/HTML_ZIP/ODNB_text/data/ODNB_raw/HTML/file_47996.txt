<span class="headword">Redwood, Sir  (Thomas) Boverton</span>, first baronet  (1846&#150;1919), <span class="occ">petroleum consultant</span>, was born in London on 26 April 1846, the eldest in the family of six sons and two daughters of Theophilus Redwood (1806&#150;1892) and his wife, Charlotte Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39362/', "Thomas Newborn Robert Morson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48072/', "Morson, Thomas")</script>], who owned a London pharmaceutical firm. After education at University College School, London (<i>c</i>.1857&#150;1862), he worked in the laboratory of his father, a professor in the School of Pharmacy of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and editor of the <span class="italic">Pharmaceutical Journal</span>. His future in pharmacy seemed to be determined; then in 1869 he abruptly changed direction by becoming secretary of the Petroleum Association, where he developed his expertise as an analytical chemist. Four years later he married Mary Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of Frederick Letchford; they had two daughters and a son who died in 1911.<br>
<br>Redwood made his reputation in undertaking technical enquiries, for example, to devise a reliable method of testing the flashpoint of combustible oil products. He invented the viscometer in 1886 to measure the fluidity of oil. He was soon in constant demand as an expert both on select committees to do with safety legislation and on inquiries into oil explosions and other accidents. He became technical adviser to the corporation of the City of London and to the Port of London Authority, and was an honorary adviser to a number of government departments, including the Home Office and the Admiralty. He was knighted in 1905 and was created a baronet in 1911.<br>
<br>Tall and of impressive presence, with heavy jutting eyebrows and a strong profile, Redwood was always immaculately turned out, with an orchid in his buttonhole. Those whom he advised were much taken with his charm and with the easy way in which he was able to put over complex facts and issues. The less charitable noted his affected and deliberate manner of speaking and his provincial accent, and the vanity that gave him pleasure when mistaken for the actor Sir Henry Irving.<br>
<br>Redwood's regular travels to oilfields in many parts of the world, notably the United States, Russia, and India, gave him a uniquely global view of oil affairs. In 1893 he became a part-time consultant to the Burmah Oil Company, a post he held for life. When in 1905 the Admiralty sought a British purchaser for the oil concession in Persia held by William Knox D'Arcy, who had so far failed to discover the extensive oil reserves there, it is almost certain that Redwood suggested Burmah Oil, which bought the concession. After three years, oil was finally discovered in Persia by George Bernard Reynolds; and when in 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later British Petroleum) was registered, the prospectus cited Redwood's report on the potential value of the oil deposits. During the same period, Weetman Pearson (later Lord Cowdray) likewise made use of Redwood for a survey of the large areas in Mexico over which he had oil prospecting rights.<br>
<br>From 1911 onwards Winston Churchill as first lord of the Admiralty was determined to change the fuel used in warships from coal to oil. This led to the establishment in 1912 of a royal commission on fuel and engines, of which Redwood was a member: it investigated the whole question of oil for the navy, and led to the government's purchase of a majority share in Anglo-Persian. During the First World War, Redwood's professional expertise was much in demand, most notably when he was petroleum adviser to the Ministry of Munitions. In 1917 he was appointed director of technical investigations in the newly set up petroleum executive, and was in charge of the technical problems of oil production and research. The strain of this unremitting toil throughout the war was undoubtedly responsible for his death in London on 4 June 1919. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Redwood was the first (and only) petroleum consultant of his kind. He not only helped to devise an oil strategy for Britain but also educated non-expert officials and businessmen alike in the technicalities of oil.<br>
