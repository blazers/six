<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thicknesse <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ford]</span>,  Ann</span>  (1737&#150;1824), <span class="occ">writer and musician</span>, was born on 22 February 1737 near the Temple, London, the only child of Thomas Ford (<i>d</i>. 1768), clerk of the arraigns, and his wife, formerly Miss Champion. Her father made sure that she had an unusually extensive education, which he claimed had cost him at least &pound;400 a year and included private lessons from singer and actor Susanna Cibber. A spirited and unconventional woman, Ford proved to be a talented musician who played several instruments and sang. In 1758 Frances Greville described her to Charles Burney as &#145;the most pleasing singer I ever heard &hellip; I would rather hear her than any Italian I have yet heard&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 5.365).<br>
<br>At first Ford performed only within domestic settings, as was deemed suitable for a woman of her class. She gave musical entertainments in her father's house, attended by leading professional and amateur musicians, as well as playing and singing at gatherings of fashionable society in London and Bath. In 1760 she was painted by Thomas Gainsborough, a fellow enthusiast for the viola da gamba and resident of Bath. She also attracted the attention of William Villiers, third earl of Jersey, a married man who apparently offered her an annuity of &pound;800 to be his mistress. Ford refused and, resolutely determined to be independent, left her father's house for that of a friend, Elizabeth Thicknesse, aiming to support herself by performing in public, an unacceptable step for a woman of her class. Her father had her arrested and brought back to the family home. Nothing daunted, she left again and announced a series of five subscription concerts at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, the first of which she gave on 18 March 1760. This series raised &pound;1500 in subscriptions, despite the efforts of the rejected earl of Jersey to detract from her enterprise. Her outraged father surrounded the theatre with runners in an attempt to prevent the first concert but Charles Bennet, third earl of Tankerville, one of Ford's aristocratic supporters, ensured that they were dispersed.<br>
<br>In early 1761 Ford published <span class="italic">A Letter from Miss F&#151;d, Addressed to a Person of Distinction</span>, in which she attempted to clear her name of malicious rumour by making public her treatment by Jersey, who denied her accusations in his response, <span class="italic">A Letter to Miss F&#151;d</span>. Ford argued that she had found &#145;many sensible people of the opinion, that a young woman may sing in public, or &hellip; be a public singer, with virtue and innocence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter from Miss F&#151;d</span>, 17&#150;18) and that performing in public was merely &#145;to repeat, for my own advantage, what I so often did, and to as large an assembly, at your house, and for your L&#151;d&#151;p's amusement&#146;  (ibid., 29). Her original letter sold 500 copies in five days and both letters gained wider distribution when they were summarized in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (January and February 1761). Despite the scandal Ford continued her public performances, playing the water-tuned musical glasses at Thomas Sheridan's lectures and, from 15 October 1761, giving a series of appearances at the Spring Gardens room, singing English airs and playing the musical glasses, English guitar, and viola da gamba. In this year of remarkable determination and achievement she also published the first known method for the musical glasses, <span class="italic">Instructions for Playing on the Musical Glasses</span>, and <span class="italic">Lessons and Instructions for Playing the Guitar</span>, which included several pieces for the guitar, almost certainly composed by Ford herself.<br>
<br>In November 1761 Ford left London with Elizabeth Thicknesse for Landguard Fort in Suffolk, where Elizabeth's husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27181/', "Philip Thicknesse")</script>, was lieutenant-governor. On 27 September 1762, six months after Elizabeth's death, Ford married Philip at Felixstowe, Suffolk. The couple had two children, John and Charlotte. There is no record of Ann Thicknesse performing again in public, although the memory of her musical career is evoked in a 1790 Gillray cartoon of Philip Thicknesse (&#145;Lieutenant Gover Gall-Stone&#146;), in which Ann is depicted playing the musical glasses.<br>
<br>The Thicknesses moved frequently, living in Hertfordshire, Monmouthshire, Hythe, and Bath, and were enthusiastic travellers. In 1775 they embarked on an eighteen-month journey (with viola da gamba, two guitars, a violin, and a parakeet); this was described in Philip Thicknesse's <span class="italic">A Year's Journey through France and Part of Spain</span>, which was published in 1777 with illustrations that are almost certainly by Ann. She herself turned to writing, publishing her <span class="italic">Sketches of the Lives and Writings of the Ladies of France</span> in three volumes between 1778 and 1781. In 1792 Philip Thicknesse died suddenly while he and Ann were travelling through France to Italy. Ann was arrested and confined in a convent but released in July 1794, after proving that she was capable of providing for herself. Her later publications included a novel, <span class="italic">The School for Fashion</span> (1800). When she made her will in 1818 she was living in Edgware Road in London with her close friend Sarah Cooper. She died on 20 January 1824.<br>
