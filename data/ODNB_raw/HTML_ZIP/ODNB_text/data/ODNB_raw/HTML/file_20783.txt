<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Owen Roe</span> <span class="st"> [Eoghan Ruadh O'Neill]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1583&#150;1649), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of Art MacBaron O'Neill (<i>c</i>.1548&#150;1618), the older &#145;base-born&#146; brother of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone. Art MacBaron had at least nine sons and four daughters from three marriages. Owen O'Neill's mother was the second wife, an unidentified daughter of Hugh Conallach O'Reilly, lord of Breifne. The birthplace of Owen Roe&#151;or Ruadh, the red or ruddy complexioned&#151;was the scenic lake district in Armagh near his father's &#145;chief house and holde&#146; at Loughall in the barony of Oneilland. Well educated by continental-trained Franciscans, he was brought up in troubled times and much of his early training involved traditional skirmishing tactics. &#145;Bred in a nursery of arms since a boy&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 1/1.72), Owen, after the death of six older brothers, served with his uncle, father, and surviving brothers in the campaigns of the Nine Years' War.<h2>
<a name="Spanishservice16051642"></a>Spanish service, 1605&#150;1642</h2>Seeking opportunities that no longer existed in war-ravaged Ulster, O'Neill and his older brothers, Art Oge and Cormack, went to the Spanish Netherlands some time after his uncle's submission to the English crown. They enlisted and received commissions as captains in an Irish regiment led by their cousin, Tyrone's son Henry O'Neill. In this &#145;vulcanian forge&#146; he and his fellow expatriates learned Spanish military tactics and the politics of survival. In the Spanish army he distinguished himself in the campaigns against the rebellious Dutch states, particularly at the successful siege of Rheinberg. The presence of these young Irish soldiers troubled the English as conditions in post-Elizabethan Ulster deteriorated. When Owen Roe's uncle the earl of Tyrone, together with Rory O'Donnell, the earl of Tyrconnell, succumbed to their failing prospects and fled in September 1607 to the continent, they undermined native Irish resistance and the fortunes of Owen O'Neill's family.<br>
<br>In the wake of this intemperate exodus, native leadership floundered and confiscation and plantation followed. O'Neill's father lost his estates, a recalcitrant older brother was executed, and many of the native northern Irish exiles were reduced to dependants of Catholic Europe. The only reliable vehicle of native Irish restitution was the Irish regiment. In English eyes it was &#145;a cloud hanging in the sky prepared to break forth upon the realm upon the first offer of a fit time&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/22/136, 122). The untimely deaths of Tyrone's sons, including the regiment's colonel, thrust Owen Roe O'Neill into a prominent role. During the minority of Tyrone's sole surviving son, John, the Louvain Franciscans under Florence Conry, titular archbishop of Tuam, chose Owen O'Neill to be the sergeant-major and tacit commander of this invaluable regiment. In this wilderness of exile, he and his Franciscan patrons evolved a crusading attitude directed at recovering their homeland and promoting their faith. The basis of their ideology was Tyrone's vision of <i>et libertate patriae</i>, grounded in a shared Catholic fatherland binding the fervour of the Counter-Reformation with the ambitions of provincial and traditional native resistance.<br>
<br>England understood what the Irish regiment meant to a new generation of displaced Irishmen and fomented discord among the fractious native and Anglicized (Old English) Catholic soldiers. O'Neill and the ever-present Franciscans did everything to deflect this animosity. Their efforts kept the regiment together, but they stirred lifelong rivalries between O'Neill and Old English officers like Thomas Preston. Strengthening O'Neill's position in the depleted exiled community was his marriage to Rosa O'Dogherty (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1660). The sister of Sir Cahir O'Dogherty of Inishowen, the leader of a short-lived post-flight Ulster insurrection, Rosa went to the continent with her first husband, Cathbar O'Donnell, the brother of the earl of Tyrconnell. Widowed in September 1609, she married O'Neill about 1613 and had one son, Henry Roe, with him. Many of O'Neill's duties after his marriage revolved around his obligations in the Spanish army. He served as military governor of the city of Rheinberg and Oloonzel, and with the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War he and the regiment were active in the Palatinate campaigns against the Dutch. He distinguished himself at the sieges of Bergen-op-Zoom and Breda. The outbreak of hostilities with England in 1625 refocused his attention on Ireland. Fearing an invasion through her Irish &#145;back door&#146;, England redoubled her efforts to undermine the regiment's unity. O'Neill and the Franciscans responded with invasion schemes that tried to reconcile the splintered Irish community.<br>
<br>In November 1627 O'Neill and archbishop Conry presented the Spanish king with an elaborate enterprise that became the basis of O'Neill's political philosophy. It called for the liberation of Ireland and its oppressed religion. They proposed the establishment of a unifying &#145;republic and kingdom&#146; where jurisdiction would be divided among the different provinces. Each jurisdiction would send deputies to the headquarters of the occupying army to vote measures and assessments. In this Catholic commonwealth the interim captain-generals would be advised and counselled by experienced officers and agents without regard to race. The pope and Catholic Europe were expected to recognize and sustain this governing experiment until an integrating Catholic monarch was selected. This extraordinary proposition never passed the drafting stage, but the experience taught O'Neill and his cohorts that the fate of their envisaged Catholic <i>patria</i> depended on their own ingenuity and resourcefulness.<br>
<br>Spain's peace with England in 1630 and the expansion of hostilities on the continent increased the need and demand for Irish soldiers. One of the five new Irish regiments formed in the 1630s was led by Colonel Owen O'Neill, known in the Spanish territories as Don Eugenio O'Neill. In his quest for recruits, he bolstered his Irish ties and gathered intelligence about conditions in Ireland. The lord deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, fearful of strengthening the regiments of disenfranchised native Irishmen, obstructed their recruiting efforts. O'Neill never lost his focus despite the new distraction of France's entry into the European war. His actions in the border province of Artois led in June 1640 to his military governorship of Arras. Outnumbered by fifty to one, for two months he held off three French armies. His celebrated defence was the apex of his career in the Spanish service.<br>
<br>While O'Neill was combating French offensives, sectarian strife in the three Stuart kingdoms drew the Catholic communities of Ireland together. Fearful that Wentworth's disbanded Irish Catholic army, raised to support the king, would be dispersed overseas, a pro-monarchy conspiracy in 1641 unfolded that attracted a desperate and accommodating O'Neill. To his way of thinking a troubled king could resolve the landed and religious grievances of the disenfranchised Irish. Through the efforts of his nephews, Con and Daniel O'Neill, he was drawn into the evolving intrigue and was granted recruiting licences that had been so vigorously denied him in the past. But the plot was stillborn when Charles I believed he had instead found non-Catholic allies in Scotland for his campaign against the parliament of England.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoIreland"></a>Return to Ireland</h2>The collapse of the plot did not deter O'Neill and his fellow northern plotters. They continued their efforts and proclaimed that their rebellion in October 1641 was not against the king, but &#145;in defense and liberty of ourselves and the Irish natives of this kingdom&#146;  (proclamation of 24 Oct 1641, TNA: PRO, SP 63/206/27, 135). The 1641 conspirators rebelled to rescue, or in some cases preserve, their estates and religious rights under the king, or without him, in his name. After planning and supplying the insurrection, O'Neill became intent on leaving the Spanish service and returning to a homeland he had not seen in thirty-five years. Dependent on a new generation of Franciscans, he strove for continual Catholic support and did what he could to elude English surveillance and appease ethnic dissensions. Those wary of his leadership and imagined ambitions were reminded that he was not going to Ireland to command &#145;but to receive what they [insurgents] may be minded to accord him &hellip; as he claims only the right to serve God and enjoy the portion that falls to him of his father's inheritance&#146;  (H. Bourke to L. Wadding, 12 April 1642, Franciscan library, Killiney, MS D. IV, 327&#150;9). After taking leave of the Spanish service, he secretly went to Ostend and about 29 June 1642 left for Ireland. With soldiers and supplies on board, his frigate hoisted a green flag with a large Irish harp. After skirting the northern coast of Scotland, he landed on 8 July at Doe Castle in Sheep Haven on the coast of Donegal.<br>
<br>The news of O'Neill's arrival excited the despairing insurgents and on 29 August at the Ulster provincial assembly at Clones he was proclaimed &#145;lord general&#146;. His cousin Sir Phelim O'Neill, a major conspirator of 1641 and rival claimant for the leadership of Ulster, reluctantly stepped down as the province's leader. With the issue of authority settled for the moment, Owen O'Neill faced the immediate problems of Ulster's deteriorating condition and the insurrection's disarray. He described the war-ravaged countryside &#145;like a hell if there could be a hell on earth&#146;. The people were so crude and barbarous &#145;that many are little better off than the most remote Indians&#146;. He lamented how there was no obedience among the soldiers &#145;if one can call men soldiers who behave nothing better than criminals&#146;. Suffering also from a lack of military supplies, native resistance was disheartened  (Jennings, 507&#150;9). He and his young continental-trained officers, his would-be &#145;Maccabees&#146;, strove to put the northern native forces in order while containing the threat of English and Scottish protestant troops under the command of Robert Monro and Alexander Leslie. Chances for a more enduring effort revolved around the new Irish Catholic confederation meeting in Kilkenny.<h2>
<a name="ONeillandtheconfederationofKilkenny"></a>O'Neill and the confederation of Kilkenny</h2>The Kilkenny confederation was a conciliatory vehicle for native and Old English Catholic interests. A rapprochement model was not unfamiliar to the Louvain Franciscans or to O'Neill. In May 1642 an embryonic commonwealth of the desperate native Irish and the legalistic Old English created a government of &#145;his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects of the kingdom of Ireland&#146; whose motto declared &#145;pro Deo, rege, et patria Hibernia unanimis&#146; (&#145;United for God, king and the Irish fatherland&#146;). But the problem was whether this consensual experiment could lay the foundation for a Catholic <i>patria</i> in a provincial-minded and religiously fractious society. At the opening sessions of the new general assembly in Kilkenny, O'Neill took the confederate oath of association. Unfortunately he was unprepared for the machinations in Kilkenny. Not a subtle politician, his causes&#151;the restoration of estates and the acceptance of his Franciscan-inspired faith&#151;ran counter to the interests of the confederation's dominant Old English constituency. Unlike O'Neill and his supporters, the Old English with their parliamentary traditions viewed the confederation as a temporary expedient for resolving their religious concerns with a struggling protestant king. In no way did they want to jeopardize their leverage and advantages on diffusive natives and their irreconcilable issues. Unwilling to empower a man of O'Neill's stature and ability, the confederate executive, the supreme council, refused to trust a unified military command to the foreign-trained Ulsterman. O'Neill became one of four regional commanders. The Leinster command went to his continental rival, Thomas Preston, whose daughter married O'Neill's Ulster antagonist, Sir Phelim O'Neill. He countered by marrying his son, Henry Roe, into the family of Preston's Leinster competitor, Sir Luke Fitzgerald.<br>
<br>After the session O'Neill returned to the north and briefed his officers and provincial leaders about the events at Kilkenny. He also worked to establish an effective fighting force and defend his vulnerable province. He adapted his considerable military skills to the skirmishing tactics of his adversaries and began by instilling discipline and an organized command to a rabble fighting-force. This task was made difficult by the constant attacks from the Scottish forces under Monro and the incursions of local protestant forces led by Sir William Stewart and Sir Robert Stewart. Not anxious to expose his inexperienced forces to these threats, O'Neill directed his men to less turbulent southern counties. On 13 June, near the town of Clones in co. Monaghan, his scattered forces stumbled into a fatal ambush. He lost many veteran commanders in this embarrassing setback. Afterwards he vowed never to &#145;give field upon any man's bidding, other than advantage&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 1/1.49).<br>
<br>O'Neill redeemed himself a few months later when the supreme council ordered the recovering northern army to relieve the embattled county of Meath. At Portlester Castle, 6 miles west of Trim, he defeated English troops under Lord Moore. Once secured, however, the Old English landowners grew anxious to rid themselves of O'Neill's northern army. His eventual withdrawal back to the desperate confines of Ulster was tied to a cessation of arms between the confederates and the king's lord deputy, James Butler, marquess of Ormond. The youthful head of a leading Old English family, Ormond was a devout royalist and protestant convert. His mission, as he saw it, was to pacify the country and provide Irish support for Charles I. These difficult priorities made Ormond, like O'Neill, a hostage to his ethnicity and religious politics. In the peace negotiations following the cessation, the protestant New English community decried concessions to papist rebels, and Old English and native factions bickered over their landed-religious agendas. Complicating the settlement also was the hard line of the new papal envoy, Pierfrancesco Scarampi. He put his faith in the military leadership of General O'Neill and cautioned confederate Catholics about negotiating away their anticipated leverage.<br>
<br>However, O'Neill's situation was precarious. Encamped again in war-torn Ulster, he did not benefit from the cessation. The long-suffering protestant settler communities of the north turned away from the cessation and their failing monarch and joined the English parliament and the Scots in the solemn league and covenant. This decision led to renewed conflict and breaches in the weakened cessation. In November 1643 O'Neill brought his grievances to the confederate general assembly. He warned the delegates about diluting their military power and cautioned the assembly that he would move his troops to Leinster if his native north was denied relief. The delegates responded by raising a confederate army to check the actions of General Robert Monro. The Old English majority did not trust this relieving army to O'Neill, and, with Preston pushing for the command, the assembly compromised and gave it to the inexperienced &#145;pseudo-general&#146; James Touchet, the earl of Castehaven. This appointment doomed the summer expedition of 1644. The earl's timid leadership never overcame the campaign's inadequate strategies or O'Neill's illness and disdain. No battle was ever fought; Monro, after wasting the countryside, retired to co. Antrim. In the months that followed, O'Neill's frustration and discontent moved him to consider returning to the Spanish Netherlands.<br>
<br>O'Neill never acted on this threat. Instead he was encouraged that the king's weakening position and growing need for Irish soldiers, together with the accession of a more energetic pope, Innocent X, might evoke significant concessions from the king's new representative, the Catholic Edward Somerset, earl of Glamorgan. But neither Glamorgan's accord nor subsequent proposals from Ormond satisfied the newly arrived papal nuncio, Archbishop Rinuccini. Disillusioned by the confederate leadership's tempered objectives, O'Neill saw the nuncio as a source of military succour and supporter for his coveted Irish Catholic commonwealth. Bolstered by Rinuccini's aid, he restructured his army and drilled them on the co-ordination of musket and the short pike. Able to defend Ulster, on 5 June 1646 he lured a protestant army led by Monro to a site near the town of Benburb in co. Armagh. Before he decisively defeated Monro in a pitched battle, he aroused his soldiers by telling them how &#145;All Christendom knows your quarrel is good&#151;to fight for your native birthright and the religion of your forefathers&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 1/1.111&#150;13). Uncontested in the field, he never followed up on his victory. Many of his soldiers dispersed with their booty, and without cannon his victorious army was incapable of capturing the north's walled garrison towns. In Waterford, Rinuccini and the assembled clergy, believing the Catholic position was strengthened, looked unfavourably on the new Ormond settlement negotiated with the supreme council. Courted by both sides, O'Neill proclaimed the guarantees of the &#145;vile treaty&#146; obstructed &#145;the propagation of the Catholic religion&#146; and &#145;the restoration of our country's freedom&#146;  (O'Ferrall and O'Connell, 2.322, 2.297).<h2>
<a name="Theconfederateschism"></a>The confederate schism</h2>By the end of August 1646 O'Neill had directed his forces to Kilkenny to support the position of the nuncio and the Catholic clergy. With his backing the council was purged, and a new executive, led by Rinuccini, took control of the confederation. Fissures in this new government erupted over the continuing negotiations with Ormond and the appointment of a confederate commander for an attack on Dublin. Unwilling to alienate the Old English clergy or their vacillating champion, Preston, the command was jointly entrusted to O'Neill and his irresolute rival. Operating under threat of excommunication and lacking sufficient ordnance, the Dublin campaign was troubled from the beginning. The latent distrust between the two generals, Preston's vulnerability to royalist pleadings, and O'Neill's concern for conserving his precious army undermined the enterprise and the momentum of the clerical coup.<br>
<br>Over the next seven months, while O'Neill secured key garrison towns in the confederate heartland, events at Kilkenny and Dublin worked against native Catholic aspirations. As each side jockeyed for power, fateful decisions undercut O'Neill's position. Ormond turned Dublin and the nearby posts over to the parliament of England in summer 1647, while the newly elected supreme council continued to splinter the confederate military command by relegating O'Neill to Connaught. By removing their undesirable protector, the council put their well-being in the hands of Preston's Leinster army, who were badly defeated at Dungan's Hill, near Trim, on 8 August by the new parliamentarian governor of Dublin, Colonel Michael Jones. The council responded by asking Rinuccini to invite the northern army back to Leinster.<br>
<br>O'Neill was distressed by these circumstances, but he recognized the alarming vulnerability of the midlands. His troops were less accommodating to these new directives. At their campsite near Kilbeggan monastery, O'Neill told his dissatisfied officers that he had returned to Ireland to serve the king, the nation, and his native province. He reminded them of their duty and declared that their timely relief would &#145;endear and create a better understanding between you and the rest of your countrymen&#146; (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 1/1.158; 3/2.206&#150;7). Despite the defection of some regiments he led his men to Kilkenny, where he protected the capital and southern Leinster from the Irish protestant general Murrough O'Brien, Lord Inchiquin, who had defeated the confederate Munster forces at Knockanoss in November 1647. Some time after Inchiquin's withdrawal the council directed O'Neill to King's county. Restrained by confederate directives, it was only after Jones returned to Dublin that O'Neill was ordered to move out and waste the countryside north of the city. He reluctantly carried out this mission and unsuccessfully endeavoured to engage Jones and his supporters.<br>
<br>O'Neill's support and service did not deter the supreme council. Wary of his power, the council and its Old English cadre did what it could to discredit the Ulster general and weakened the nuncio and his clerical supporters. As for O'Neill's ill-provisioned and unappreciated troops, they were racked by mutinies and the machinations of recalcitrant leaders like Sir Phelim O'Neill. The situation deteriorated to the point where O'Neill and Rinuccini felt unsafe in the confederate capital, but the fateful breach erupted after the council signed a cessation of arms with Inchiquin on 20 May 1648. They believed that the Munster leader would provide a defender less controversial than O'Neill and hoped that Inchiquin's royalism might rekindle negotiations with Ormond. Put off by their choice of allies, O'Neill supported Rinuccini's condemnation of the cessation with its censure of excommunication. The supreme council responded by rescinding his military command. O'Neill and his officers countered that they had stood by their oath of association for the defence of religion and the king. They accused the &#145;malignant party&#146; of treachery and &#145;private advantage even at the cost of the ruin of the kingdom, the violation of their oath and the extinction of the faith&#146; (O'Ferrall and O'Connell, 3.293&#150;5; Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 68, fols. 156&#150;8). Appreciating that the clerical party depended on O'Neill, the council retaliated, and by the end of June Inchiquin, Preston, and all the confederate forces moved against his ill-succoured army. Throughout the summer months he adeptly manoeuvred his forces against adversaries who were bent on his disarray or defeat. When no advantage for battle presented itself, he cautioned his aroused forces and took the position of the Roman consul Fabius the Delayer. Why risk all in one battle, he asked:<blockquote>to purchase the sweet fruits of revenge &hellip; with the hazard of our whole body, the only one in Ireland for religion, king and kingdom, as long as we hold in a body, though we never give a blow: the enemy will fear us.(O'Ferrall and O'Connell, 3.516&#150;18; Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>, 1/1.268)</blockquote>When he failed at combat, the supreme council and the new general assembly declared O'Neill a traitor, a rebel against the king and the fundamental laws of the land, and a &#145;manifest opposer of the established government of the Confederation&#146;  (proclamation, 30 Sept 1648, Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 22, fol. 177). At this juncture Ormond returned to Ireland with a commission to conclude a peace treaty. Still preferring to settle things with the crown, O'Neill welcomed Ormond. Unfortunately the reliability of royal agents was fading in proportion to the ascendancy of the English parliament.<h2>
<a name="Desperationanddeath"></a>Desperation and death</h2>O'Neill's position deteriorated rapidly after Ormond and the confederates concluded a treaty on 17 January 1649. It was followed by Charles I's execution and Rinuccini's departure. Ostracized and without dependable benefactors, O'Neill was thrown upon his own devices. Unable to obtain necessary guarantees from Ormond, he unwillingly made desperate accommodations to survive. He opened negotiations with parliamentarian commanders in Ireland and on 8 May signed a cessation of hostilities with George Monck for three months. The benefits of the cessation were short-lived. Monck was secured against O'Neill's attachment to Ormond and O'Neill received much-needed provisions after supporting the parliamentarian garrison at Dundalk. In the end, parliament dissociated itself from Monck's pact and refused openly to deal with O'Neill and his party. Anxious to keep his army in the field, O'Neill also signed a truce with Sir Charles Coote and came to his relief when the Scots besieged Londonderry. Within a few weeks his bargaining position increased when Jones defeated Ormond at Rathmines and Oliver Cromwell landed in Ireland. Despite these desperate conditions, it was almost the middle of October before the parties signed the articles of peace. The accord gave O'Neill most of the secular and religious guarantees he coveted. It also provided him and his followers with the promise of an act of oblivion and assured the native leader land and political considerations in any final peace settlement. Unfortunately the pact was made with a king whose promises no longer had the weight of law. O'Neill was also terminally ill and was carried about on a horse litter. He dispatched his forces to Ormond's service, while he retired to Cloughoughter Castle, about 6 miles west of Cavan. In his last letters to Ormond he asked the lord lieutenant to be patient and not risk his men needlessly. He also requested that Ormond take care of his son, Colonel Henry O'Neill, and see to it that he benefited from &#145;such conditions, concessions and creations, as his Majesty intended for me&#146;  (O'Neill to Ormond, 1 Nov 1649, Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 26, fol. 49). On Tuesday 6 November 1649, he died at Cloughoughter Castle; he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Franciscan priory in Cavan.<h2>
<a name="Appraisal"></a>Appraisal</h2>O'Neill's unfolding story was first attempted in an unsigned, sentimental article in the <span class="italic">Ulster Journal of Archaeology</span> in 1856. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the availability of J. T. Gilbert's multi-volume editions of contemporary accounts and correspondence provided a published basis for setting O'Neill in a more full and balanced historical framework, and S. R. Gardiner drew upon it in his treatment of O'Neill for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in 1894. Two years later J. F. Taylor published the first biography of the Ulster leader, a small popular nationalist account concentrating on his career after 1642. In 1914 Diarmid Coffey contrasted O'Neill to Ormond's royalist dealings, while over the next half-century at least four brief biographies appeared, each of them an abridged adaptation of Taylor's work. No new light was shed either by the work produced for the tercentenary of O'Neill's death or by T. S. O'Cahan's romantic 1969 biography. The first complete historical treatment of O'Neill, detailing both his early life and his civil war career, was published by the present writer in 1984. O'Neill's values and motivations were subsequently evaluated by Raymond Gillespie in a brief biographical article, while further specialized studies of aspects of O'Neill's career and opinions were undertaken by Casway.<br>
<br>In retrospect O'Neill appears a skilled and resourceful military leader who with proper ordnance and support might have made gains commensurate with his abilities. But knowing how to assemble a fighting force and keeping it in the field were fruitless if a general could not affect the maintenance and politics of a campaign. It is also sometimes overlooked that his power rested on his military prowess and not on his hereditary position in the society of the Ulster clans. Never the master of his fate, he remained dependent on myopic and declining powers. Spain, Rome, and the confederate leadership utilized his skills and profited from his service. But these powers never had the capacity or willingness to reorder the protestant landed settlement of Ulster or the resources to restore the privileges of the Irish Catholic church. O'Neill's hope that a liberated Catholic fatherland could ameliorate the ethnic and provincial divisions of Ireland never stood a chance in a realm ruled by a religiously contentious protestant monarch in an age of Calvinist ascendancy. Nor could his efforts and sacrifices move his Old English confederates to tie their threatened well-being to the eclipsed world of native Irish Ulster.<br>
