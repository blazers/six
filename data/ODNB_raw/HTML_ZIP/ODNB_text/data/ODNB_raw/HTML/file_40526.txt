<span class="headword">Bostock,  Bridget</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Cheshire Doctoress]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1678, <em>d.</em> after 1749), <span class="occ">faith healer</span>, details of whose parentage are unknown, lived in Coppenhall, Cheshire, throughout her life and was uneducated. &#145;Aged about 70 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 18.414), Bostock came to national attention in August 1748 as the result of a report about her in a local newspaper. She had been healing locally for many years with the use of fasting spittle, a little liquor of &#145;a red complexion&#146;, touch, and prayer. In 1748 people of all social ranks began to visit her, and by September she was receiving crowds of 600&#150;700 a day. She was said to cure blind, deaf, and lame people, and those with rheumatism, the king's evil (scrofula), hysteric fits, falling fits, shortness of breath, dropsy, palsy, leprosy, and cancers (though not syphilis). Bostock did not seek such fame or numbers, and by late 1748 she saw only those who had been to her before and those suffering from deafness. She was described as a frequent churchgoer and as a person of great character and faith by her minister, William Harding, whose son claimed that she cured his lameness. John Bennet, a Methodist minister, visited her twice and recorded in his diary his impressions and the reports of others, ultimately declaring himself unable to account for her cures. John Wesley, who heard accounts of her healings, did not doubt them. Sir John Price, a Welsh baronet, wrote asking her to raise his wife from the dead. Bostock refused despite Price's entreaties&#151;peppered with biblical texts concerning resurrection&#151;in his letters to her written between December 1748 and December 1749. Some visitors and commentators sought to explain her cures in natural terms, while others described her as an impostor or cheat who deceived the &#145;vulgar&#146;. Several also offered accounts of her physical appearance. One described &#145;an old shrivelled creature seated in an elbow chair in a most dirty attire, and her petticoats not reaching above half-way down her legs&#146;, while another spoke less harshly of her dress of &#145;flannel waistcoat, a green linsey apron, a pair of clogs, and a plain cap, tied with a half-penny lace&#146;  (Chaloner, 6, 9&#150;10). There is no record of what happened to Bridget Bostock after 1749, but interest in her continued into the next century, as evidenced by two letters in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> for June and August 1808.<br>
