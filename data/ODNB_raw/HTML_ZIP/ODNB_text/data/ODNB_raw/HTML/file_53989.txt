<span class="headword">Smith,  John</span> <span class="st"> [Iain  Mac a' Ghobhainn, Iain Ph&agrave;draig]</span>  (1848&#150;1880), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Iarsiadar, Uig, on the island of Lewis, the son of Janet (or Joan) MacDonald, a general servant from Bernera. He was recognized as the son of Peter Smith, a sheep farmer; a gift for composing poetry ran in this family. John spent five years at the University of Edinburgh, anticipating a career in medicine, but tuberculosis cut short his university career and brought his life to an early close. About 1874 he returned to Uig, where he died in Crulivig on 27 December 1880.<br>
<br>Most of Smith's surviving poetry seems to have been composed in the last seven years of his life. It has acquired a strong historical relevance because of contemporary events in Uig and the adjoining island of Bernera, from which John's mother came. The Bernera riot took place in 1874, when the island of Lewis was owned by Sir James Matheson and his chamberlain was Donald Munro. In a series of cynical manoeuvres, Munro gradually excluded the people of Uig and Bernera from their grazing and shieling rights on the border between Lewis and Harris, and subsequently also from the vicinity of Iarsiadar, where they had lately built a 7 mile stone dyke to mark off their grazing land from the deer forest. They were given smaller and poorer lands in Bernera at a similar rent and with no compensation. This led to an incursion on Stornoway of some 150 men, led by a piper; when Sir James Matheson was told what Munro had done&#151;apparently without his knowledge or approval&#151;the decision was reversed and Munro was taken to court and dismissed.<br>
<br>Smith's poetry deals powerfully and poignantly with these events, and one poem in particular, &#145;Spiorad a' Charthannais&#146; (&#145;The spirit of kindliness&#146;) can be regarded as the classic condemnation of landlords who inspired or condoned tyranny exercised over smallholders in the highlands. This situation was often associated with the development and protection of sporting estates, and resulted regularly in the clearance of tenants from the land. Practices of this kind had been going on for a hundred years, but the Bernera riot and risings in Skye in the following decade led eventually to the setting up of the Crofters' Commission, and improved conditions of tenancy for crofters and smallholders. The poetry of Mary Macpherson of Skye is often also cited as an important factor in these developments, but Smith's contribution was earlier and sharper. Of the &#145;clearers&#146; he says (in translation from his Gaelic original):<blockquote>
<div>They handed over to the snipe<br>
</div>
<div>the land of happy folk,<br>
</div>
<div>they dealt without humanity<br>
</div>
<div>with people who were kind.<br>
</div>
<div>Because they might not drown them<br>
</div>
<div>they dispersed them overseas;<br>
</div>
<div>a thralldom worse than Babylon's<br>
</div>
<div>was the plight that they were in.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He has the worm reflecting on the banquet it enjoys from the dead landlords and their bailiffs:<blockquote>
<div>The wriggling worm will praise you then<br>
</div>
<div>for your flesh's enticing taste,<br>
</div>
<div>when it finds you placed before it<br>
</div>
<div>on its table, silent now,<br>
</div>
<div>saying &#145;This one's juicy flesh<br>
</div>
<div>is good for earthy worms,<br>
</div>
<div>since he made many hundreds thin<br>
</div>
<div>to feed himself for me.&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Smith also composed humorous and satirical verse, a wry commentary on pharisaical Christians, a poem on Bannockburn, and a mock-Ossianic ballad. The survival, and appearance in print, of Smith's surviving work is largely owed to John N. MacLeod, who published a collection of poetry from Lewis in 1916, and gave a detailed introduction, from which the above summary of events is derived.<br>
