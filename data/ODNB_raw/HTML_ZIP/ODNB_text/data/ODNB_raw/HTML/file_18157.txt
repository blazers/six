<span class="headword">Marshall,  William</span>  (1806&#150;1875), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in Oxford, the son of William Marshall, a local music-seller. He was sent to London at an early age and gained his musical education as chorister of the Chapel Royal under John Stafford Smith and William Hawes. In 1825 he was appointed organist to Christ Church and St John's College, Oxford, and for some time he also officiated as organist at the church of All Saints. He took the degree of MusB on 7 December 1826, and that of MusD on 14 January 1840. His published compositions were <span class="italic">Three Canzonets</span> (1825) and <span class="italic">Cathedral Services</span> (1847), and in collaboration with Alfred Bennett he edited <span class="italic">A Collection of Cathedral Chants</span> (1829). His most important work, however, was <span class="italic">A Collection of Anthems used in the Cathedral and Collegiate Churches of England and Wales</span> (1840), to which an appendix was added in 1851, and which reached its fourth edition in 1862. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Art of Reading Church Music</span> (1842).<br>
<br>At the urging of his friend Thomas Legh Claughton, then professor of poetry at Oxford and for a long period vicar of the parish church of Kidderminster, Marshall was persuaded in 1846 to leave Oxford and become organist and choirmaster to St Mary's, Kidderminster. He spent most of the rest of his life in the town and devoted his spare time to giving instruction in music. He was spoken of as a fine organist, and as being specially admirable as a teacher and conductor. On various occasions he conducted the rehearsals of the Philharmonic Society in London with great success. He continued to be involved in music throughout his life, for he was professionally engaged in Liverpool only a month before his death, which took place at Handsworth, Birmingham, on 17 August 1875.<br>
<br>William's younger brother <a name="cosubject_18132"></a><span class="headword">Charles Ward Marshall</span>  (1808&#150;1876), <span class="occ">singer</span>, achieved some success as a tenor on the London stage about 1835, under the assumed name of Manvers. In 1842 he turned his attention to concert and oratorio singing, which brought him greater acclaim, but some six or eight years afterwards he withdrew from public life. He died at Islington on 22 February 1876.<br>
