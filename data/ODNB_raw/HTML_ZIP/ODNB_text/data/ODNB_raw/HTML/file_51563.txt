<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Christison, Sir  (Alexander Frank) Philip</span>, fourth baronet  (1893&#150;1993), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at 40 Moray Place, Edinburgh, on 17 November 1893, the elder of the two sons and eldest of five children of Sir Alexander Christison, second baronet (1828&#150;1918), surgeon-general in the Bengal army, and his second wife, Florence (1861&#150;1949), daughter of F. T. Elworthy, of Foxdown, Wellington, Somerset. He had one half-brother and three half-sisters from his father's first marriage, to Jemima Anne (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of James Cowley Brown, a civil servant in India. Like his grandfather and his father (who lived to eighty-five and ninety respectively) he was destined for a long life, and began a career in medicine. Indeed his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5370/', "Sir Robert Christison, first baronet")</script>, had been physician to Queen Victoria in Scotland. For six weeks in 1914 he himself was an officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps: in his last days he hoped to be remembered as a general who &#145;had a great part in beating tropical disease in Burma&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). From Edinburgh Academy he went to University College, Oxford, to read medicine: he joined the Officers' Training Corps of both. At &#145;Univ&#146; he rowed for the college and played rugby for the university. The First World War prevented his qualifying medically; so he turned pro tem to soldiering, taking up not scalpel but sword. In 1973 he was made an honorary fellow of University College, together with Prime Minister Harold Wilson.<br>
<br>Christison was commissioned into the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1914. During 1915 he fought as a captain with his 6th battalion at the battle of Loos, was severely wounded, evacuated to the UK and earned both a mention in dispatches and a (newly created) Military Cross. His younger brother, Frederick John (<i>b</i>. 1894), a lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was killed in action on 2 December 1915. On 29 February 1916 Christison married his childhood friend, Lizzie Isobel 
    (Betty; 1894&#150;1974)
  , daughter of the Rt Revd Anthony Mitchell, bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney; they were to have one son, John Anthony Alexander, and three daughters, Heather Cameron, Alison Ann, and Fiona. Shortly after the marriage Christison returned to France, fought at the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, won a bar to his MC, and was again mentioned in dispatches. Peace found him in the Rhine occupation, as adjutant to 4th King's Own Scottish Borderers and his Camerons. Though the scalpel had by then been forsaken, he ever kept a mind keen to heal rather than destroy. In 1924 he co-managed the British team for the Paris Olympics&#151;the year that the Scottish runner Eric Liddell won gold. He had to house the team and get it to the start line. It was a time of fishing and shooting by day, of opera and theatre by night in Germany.<br>
<br>In 1927 Christison went to Camberley Staff College: Oliver Leese passed out first, and he fifth. In 1934 he returned there as a tactics instructor: finding his commandant, Lord Gort, wholly outdated (though destined for high responsibility during the period 1937&#150;41), he redesigned the tactics course from root. As a brevet colonel, in 1937 he was advanced to command 2nd battalion, the duke of Wellington's regiment on the north-west frontier. (For a decade from 1947 he became the regiment's colonel, and colonel of the 10th Gurkha rifles.) A young forty-four, he was climbing high hills and writing new drill books for Auchinleck in Delhi. His son was at Keble College, Oxford, on the edge of a rugby blue; one of his daughters was at Girton College, Cambridge. He took leave to survey Baluchistan ornithology, writing a bird book (published 1940). Alanbrooke approved! In 1938 Christison advanced to command 4th infantry brigade in Quetta (headquarters western command), going on to be the Staff College's commandant, as Leese left instructing at Quetta to join the British expeditionary force and to command the 15th Scottish division, which Christison commanded next. In 1942 he returned a third time to Quetta to form an army corps to protect India's western flank. By late 1943 Slim was given his Fourteenth Army; Mountbatten ordered Christison to take over Slim's 15th Indian corps in Arakan, in eastern Burma. His son and heir, a captain in the 2nd Duke of Wellington's regiment, had been killed in the long retreat from Sittang Bridge, in 1942.<br>
<br>Christison (who was promoted major-general in 1941 and lieutenant-general in 1942) at once developed the hedgehog principle of Bruce of Bannockburn&#151;a defensive ring served by supply and casualty evacuation by air. The Kohima front equally adopted the hedgehog method: Japanese initiatives were eroded piecemeal. The Arakan coastal area was compared to Norwegian fjords, the Japanese holding the jungle spines of over 3000 feet. It became known as &#145;the battle of the admin box&#146;. Air supply being crucially successful, the strategy steadily paid off. Of the Second Arakan Battle, Slim wrote in 1956:<blockquote>It was one of the historic successes of British arms. It was the turning point of the Burma campaign. For the first time a British force had met, held and decisively defeated a major Japanese attack, driving the enemy out of the strongest possible positions. (Slim, 245)</blockquote>Churchill signalled: &#145;You have burst the bubble of Japanese invincibility&#146;  (Christison, 130). Slim wrote for Christison on the flyleaf of his memoir: &#145;Phil, you won the first British victory over the Japanese on land: Bill&#146;  (personal knowledge). Together they were knighted in the field by Wavell, the viceroy (the first such event since the middle ages). Invested CB and KBE in 1944, Christison&#151;unusually for a general&#151;was appointed to the DSO in 1945; and there was a third mention in dispatches. On 15 May 1945 Christison's half-brother, Sir Robert Alexander Christison, third baronet (1870&#150;1945), died childless, and Christison succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
<br>In May 1945, after further operational successes at Akyab and Ramree and the Rangoon River, Christison was drawn into a command <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. Leese, then commander-in-chief allied land forces, south-east Asia, summoned him to Akyab and told him: &#145;Christie, Dickie [Mountbatten] has felt awhile that Slim has become a tired man, and I agree. I have been told to ease him out; and you are to take over command of 14th Army at once&#146;  (Christison, 164). This caused consternation in cabinet. Eventually it was Leese who was relieved and Slim who was promoted. Christison filled the command of allied land forces, south-east Asia, until Slim completed needed leave, returning to his 15th corps. On 3 September 1945, being alone available, he took the surrender of the Japanese Seventh Army and south-east fleet with air forces, at Singapore, reversing the shame of General Arthur Percival in 1942. He had just presided over &#145;Sittang, the last battle&#146;, where almost the entire Japanese army was annihilated by the Indian army before its own sad partition. Christison wrote: &#145;I saw such scenes at Passchendaele: many went mad or wandered &hellip; Thus the War's last battle, 20,000 Japanese perishing under most terrible conditions&#146;  (Christison, 172&#150;3).<br>
<br>In September 1945, Mountbatten side-stepping the task, Christison was sent as allied commander to the Dutch East Indies to disarm 60,000 enemy; to succour 20,000 prisoners of war; and to govern the area until the Dutch governors, then in Queensland, returned. As &#145;guests of the Dutch&#146;, it was a political-referee task. Yet the word &#145;Indonesia&#146;, as a new republic, intimating self-government, was emerging. Japanese arms were falling to freedom fighters&#151;who rounded up 200,000 Dutch and Eurasians into over-full camps. Unrealistically, the government of The Hague refused to support their East Indies officials. Christison was driven to rearm Japanese troops, for their survival and for law enforcement in the face of civil war: they became guards to civilian convoys. Sokarno's Indonesia had come, the Dutch were never to return, and the British became targets. Christison compared it to the bestialities of the French Revolution. His task became no more than the control-to-rescue of mainly internees or prisoners of war and European families. He was allowed little response to extreme violence, and yet got a bad press, for example for casualties. At the last stage peace and the press came his way. Christison claimed it was the most delicately difficult task he was ever given. No honours came from it, except a Chinese order of Cloud and Banner. Prime Minister Attlee later said: &#145;We were lucky to have a soldier&#150;statesman there&#146;  (Christison, 189).<br>
<br>Christison returned home in 1946 to be general officer commanding-in-chief, northern command, in York. Prince Bernhard came to be briefed on Indonesia, refused earlier by his own Dutch prime minister. Northern civics treated the general as below-high-table; so he went back to field sports. He was soon sent to Scotland as general officer commanding-in-chief, with the rank of full general, collecting his furniture from a decade of storage in Camberley. He established the first military tattoo in 1947. He was advanced to GBE in 1948, where&#151;with such a record&#151;GCB might have been more fitting for a full general; though George VI made him his Scottish aide-de-camp general. The most senior general, he was entitled to promotion to field marshal, but refused. He and Betty conquered full rationing to entertain many, and were duly gathered to greater functions in Scotland. First World War commanders retired with golden handshakes. The Christisons, with their four children to see established, got no more than a &#145;maximum pension&#146; of &pound;1500 p.a., after a life with no chance to save. They found The Croft at Melrose in 1949, becoming fruit farmers near the River Tweed, next to the abbey. Triple colonelcy caused travel, as did multiple presidencies and chairmanships, including those of the Scottish Unionist Party (1957&#150;8), the Earl Haig Fund, the Lodge Trust for Ornithology, and the Clarsach Society. His wife, Betty, died in March 1974; on 10 December the same year Christison married Vida Wallace Smith MBE (1901&#150;1992), a WRNS officer and civil servant. Christison himself died at his home, The Croft, Melrose, Roxburghshire, on 21 December 1993, shortly after celebrating his hundredth birthday; he was buried in Melrose on the 23rd. A memorial service was held in St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, on 28 January 1994. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.<br>
<br>In 1929 Christison came to know a diminutive Japanese officer, on staff attachment for a year. In 1945, at a ceremony in Jakarta, General Yamamoto was called to surrender to Christison, now the general officer commanding-in-chief. Yamamoto said: &#145;I hoped you would not recognize: my shame is great &hellip; have my family sword, which was made at Bizen in the 16th century&#146;  (Christison, 178&#150;9). The general took that sword back to Melrose. In 1990 the Japanese Army Association honoured Christison's memory in Indonesia. So he decided to return the Bizen sword to the officer's widow, with the words: &#145;I shall forgive, but I shall not forget&#146;  (personal knowledge). Others afterwards did the same, notably Bernard Weatherill, speaker of the Commons. Wounds were salved, as a doctor might say.<br>
