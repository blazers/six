<span class="headword">Pocock,  Robert</span>  (1760&#150;1830), <span class="occ">printer and antiquary</span>, born at Gravesend, Kent, on 21 February 1760, was the third and youngest son of John Pocock (<i>c</i>.1719&#150;1772), shopkeeper, who had married firstly Jane Channell (1717&#150;1749) at Gravesend in 1745, and secondly Martha Williams (<i>c</i>.1719&#150;1776) of East Greenwich, Kent, in 1750. Robert was the only son of this second marriage. He was educated at the free school in Gravesend and then was apprenticed to his mother as a shopkeeper, on 18 February 1774, his father having died in 1772. In January 1776 Martha Pocock died, leaving to Robert her stock-in-trade as well as the High Street property held by her in trust for both him and his half-brother John. Robert married, probably in 1778, Ann, daughter of Edward Stillard of London. They had five children. Ann died in March 1791; in the following year on 19 March Robert married Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1766, <i>d</i>. 1818), daughter of John Hinde of Milton Regis, Kent. This marriage produced seven children.<br>
<br>In 1786 Pocock founded the first circulating library and printing office in Gravesend, and his first literary productions were some children's books. He wrote a chronology and a history of Gravesend in 1790 and 1797 respectively, and made other contributions to the topographical and family history of Kent. He also wrote a history of Dartford as well as some other works, which were never printed. In addition Pocock was by 1802 dealing, as his trade card states, in &#145;natural and other curiosities, collected from different parts of the world&#146;, and was in 1812 the first chairman of the Kent Natural History Society.<br>
<br>Pocock was a man of great versatility, as shown by his published diaries, which cover the years 1811&#150;12, 1815, and 1822&#150;3, but even so he ran into financial difficulties. In 1811 Thomas Cadell from Rochester set up a rival press in Gravesend, which did not help matters, and Pocock was obliged in December 1811 to transfer his properties to his wife's relations, and to borrow money from them. He eventually moved to Dartford, Kent, some time between 1823 and 1827, living with his son George Admiral Pocock, who had set up his press there in 1823. His latter years were passed in comparative poverty. Robert Pocock died of heart disease at Dartford on 26 October 1830, and was buried at Wilmington, Kent, on 2 November.<br>
