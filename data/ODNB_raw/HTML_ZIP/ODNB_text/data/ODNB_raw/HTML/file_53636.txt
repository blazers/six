<span class="headword">Flete,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Brother William of England]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1352&#150;1380), <span class="occ">Augustinian friar and hermit</span>, always called himself Brother William of England. He was first designated &#145;of Flete&#146;, which presumably refers to Fleet in Lincolnshire, when the prior-general of his order granted him conventual status at the priory of Lecceto, near Siena, in September 1359. His native connections were clearly with eastern England. He was licensed in February 1352 to preach for the diocese of Ely, and studied theology at Cambridge as a member of the Augustinian community there. A note in the manuscript of a sermon in commemoration of Catherine of Siena, perhaps dubiously attributed to him, says that he composed it around 1382 when he was &#145;about seventy&#146; and that he survived the saint &#145;for several years&#146;. More exact dates cannot be determined for his birth or for the landmarks of his early life.<br>
<br>Flete was known in Catherine's circle as <i>il baccelliere</i> (&#145;the bachelor&#146;). He had entered upon the stages preparatory to receiving the master's degree at Cambridge, but decided not to proceed and in July 1359 left England to spend the rest of his life at Lecceto, hallowed in Augustinian tradition as the very heart of the order and supposedly associated with Augustine himself. He thus detached himself totally from his native land, eschewing careerism and seeking spiritual perfection. At Lecceto he acquired a reputation for asceticism exceeding the requirements of the rule, and won the regard of two prominent holy men, Giovanni Colombini, founder of the Gesuati, and the Vallombrosan Giovanni dalle Celle. He has however attracted most attention as an associate of Catherine of Benincasa (St Catherine of Siena). On the evidence of a witness at the canonical process of investigation into Catherine's sanctity initiated in 1410, they knew each other already by early 1368, but another source intimates that they did not actually meet before January 1377, when Catherine visited Lecceto and Flete took down at her dictation a statement of her &#145;spiritual doctrine&#146;. Benedict Hackett has argued for Augustinian influence on Catherine's early development and suggests that Flete may have been her guide.<br>
<br>There is some indication that Catherine thought Flete inclined to overvalue the ascetic's total seclusion. Perhaps influenced by her activist piety, he shared with her, between 1373 and 1375, in successful efforts to reform certain Sienese reprobates. His sole recorded excursion outside Lecceto was to attend the consecration of a conventual church founded by Catherine in the castle of Belcaro, donated to her by one of these penitents. In 1379, however, he refused to obey the summons to Rome which Urban VI (probably at Catherine's instigation) issued to him and other holy men in order to gain support in the early stages of the schism. Catherine was severely displeased, but at her death in 1380 she wished Flete none the less to share in the direction of her &#145;family&#146; of devotees. It is not known where or when he himself died and was buried.<br>
<br>Flete's letters to Catherine do not survive; a handful of hers to him do. In 1377 he wrote to her confessor Raymond of Capua extolling her virtues, and he urged the public profession of obedience to Urban VI in letters to the rulers of Siena and to his Augustinian brethren in England; to the latter, breaking the silence of his self-imposed exile, he addressed other salutary spiritual counsels. The treatise <span class="italic">De remediis contra temptaciones</span>, which he may have composed before leaving England, achieved a considerable manuscript circulation, in England and elsewhere: Hackett lists twenty-one complete Latin and fourteen English extant manuscripts. Its influence has been detected on Walter Hilton and also perhaps on Thomas More.<br>
