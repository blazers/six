<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Anna <span class="st"> [Nan]</span></span>  (1893&#150;1981), <span class="occ">author and college teacher</span>, was born on 11 February 1893 at Westerton Cottage, East Peterculter, near Aberdeen, the second child of John Shepherd, a civil engineer, and Jane Smith Shepherd (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelly). Her paternal grandparents were farmers from Strachan and Drum; her mother's father was a well-known tailor in the city of Aberdeen, and her mother's uncle was the renowned local architect Dr William Kelly. Nan Shepherd had one elder brother, Frank, who became a civil engineer like his father, and died in South Africa, where he had gone to recuperate after serving in the First World War.<br>
<br>&#145;I have had the same bedroom all my life&#146;, Shepherd once said. She lived in a house called Dunvegan, 503 North Deeside Road, in the village of Cults, 3 miles from Aberdeen; her family moved there a month after her birth. She attended Cults primary school (and went back in her eighties to tell enthralled pupils what it was like to be taught there at the turn of the century), then she proceeded to Aberdeen High School for Girls, then studied at the University of Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1915. Upon graduating she joined the staff of Aberdeen Training Centre for Teachers (later Aberdeen College of Education), becoming lecturer in English in 1919. She taught there until she retired in 1956, after which she edited the <span class="italic">Aberdeen University Review</span> from 1957 to 1963, writing essays on subjects such as Hugh MacDiarmid, the poet Charles Murray, and women in the university from 1892 to 1942. In 1964 the University of Aberdeen awarded her an honorary doctorate.<br>
<br>In 1928, when Shepherd was thirty-five, she published her first novel. <span class="italic">The Quarry Wood</span>, a novel which honours in its descriptions the university she loved so much, is the story of the emotional and intellectual education of its young heroine, Martha Ironside, who fights for the money and space for a school and university education, then comes to understand that the learning process involves the world beyond books too, a world of &#145;sharny boots and hacked hands seamed with dirt&#146;, that ideals are best tempered with reality, and that nature is a pretty good partner for intellect. Shepherd's next novel was <span class="italic">The Weatherhouse</span>, published in 1930, and her third and final novel, <span class="italic">A Pass in the Grampians</span>, was published in 1933. Both of these, like <span class="italic">The Quarry Wood</span>, deal with the clash between tradition and modernity, and are set lovingly in small communities in the north-east of Scotland, full of the rich, harsh speech of its people and the bleakness and the splendour of its mountains and weather. As Roderick Watson puts it: &#145;Nan Shepherd manages to invest the dourness of the Scottish land &hellip; with imagination and grace&#146;  (Watson, &#145;Introduction&#146;, <span class="italic">The Weatherhouse</span>). All three novels deal with the getting of wisdom and the challenging of convention; each one has its own lively, clever young woman trying to sort out self-knowledge from self-deception; each has a democratic layered narrative that builds up a picture not just of the individual but of the workings of community and communal responsibility; and each one has, in its tenacious narrator, the promise of a tolerant, humorous, intelligent, and ever open mind.<br>
<br>Shepherd's love for her native Aberdeenshire and the nearby Grampians is displayed throughout her work. She was an avid hill-walker and climber, and this is celebrated in her final two books. As a student she had published several poems in the student magazine, <span class="italic">Alma Mater</span>, which she also edited, but it was not until 1934 that she published <span class="italic">In the Cairngorms</span>, her slim volume of poems. Almost all of her poetry, from her early work to late unpublished pieces now in her archive at the National Library of Scotland, hymns the combination of nature and intellect, and <span class="italic">In the Cairngorms</span> is like the novels in its sense of &#145;the mind's own fineness&#146; passionately engaged with the vastness, beauty, and ultimate indifference of rock, water, light, and air. The collection ends on a series of bruised and oblique love sonnets; &#145;very few people understand them,&#146; she said once, &#145;which makes me feel better&#146;.<br>
<br>Shepherd's final book, <span class="italic">The Living Mountain</span>, a series of meditations on the Cairngorm Mountains, was written in the 1940s and, after one publisher's &#145;courteous and negative&#146; refusal, left unpublished in a drawer until 1977. &#145;It was written during the latter years of the Second War and those just after. In that disturbed and uncertain world it was my secret place of ease&#146;, she wrote in the foreword. This Zen-like &#145;pilgrimage to the mountain&#146; is delightful, an enlightened fusion of philosophy and reportage on the forms and force of life everywhere in the beloved landscape:<blockquote>I can imagine the antiquity of rock, but the antiquity of a living flower&#151;that is harder. It means that these toughs of the mountain top, with their angelic inflorescence and the devil in their roots, have had the cunning and the effrontery to cheat, not only a winter, but an Ice Age. (Shepherd, <span class="italic">The Living Mountain</span>)</blockquote>Friends and former students remember a similar and joyful tenacity of spirit in Shepherd herself, as well as her sense of humour, her spellbinding teaching talent, and a feminist approach in her lectures years ahead of her time. A fellow member of staff at the college of education remembered how &#145;on my first morning I found a posy from her garden on my desk. That was typically Nan&#146;. She was, friends recall, &#145;a lovely woman, with masses of auburn hair, and possessed of a fine speaking voice of a rare range&#146;, &#145;a tall slim figure with a halo of chestnut plaits&#146;. Photographs of the young Nan Shepherd show a face full and open, likeably stubborn, a woman with beautiful hooded eyes that are at once determined and unsure, long luxurious hair, and an almost devil-may-care penchant for an arts-and-crafts style in clothes. In photos at the end of her life, her weather-lined face has lost none of its strength, and the eyes are still that mixture of sharp, direct, and self-protective.<br>
<br>Long friendships with Neil Gunn, Charles Murray, Agnes Mure Mackenzie, Willa Muir, Helena Shire, and many other writers, characterized Shepherd's life. When Lewis Grassic Gibbon died, she organized a trust fund for his bereaved wife and family; after the deaths of the poets J. C. Milne and Charles Murray she helped bring about publication of their last poems. But the most arresting story of her generosity and her bearing can be found in Jessie Kesson's warm recollection of the &#145;lady&#146; Kesson fell over the feet of in a train carriage one dramatic day in 1941 when she was a milkmaid at an Aberdeenshire farm. Several weeks after the talkative train journey the lady wrote to tell her to write a story for a local competition, then offered to help, if necessary, with the entry fee of 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Kesson &#145;won the first prize of a Book Token, and learned the name of the Lady in the train&#146;, a good friend and helpful critic for the rest of her life. &#145;I was graced by Nan Shepherd&#146;, Kesson concludes  (Kesson, &#145;Nan Shepherd in recollection&#146;).<br>
<br>Nan Shepherd seems to have valued her privacy highly, and was modest to the point of dismissiveness about her own fiction. In 1976 a local newspaper interviewed &#145;the forgotten authoress of Cults&#146;. The journalist, caught off-balance by the old lady's intelligence, sat amazed as Shepherd, laughing, &#145;a twinkle in her eye&#146;, waved old reviews in the air that proclaimed her a writer of genius, saying, as if nothing could matter less, &#145;that's what you call a passing reputation&#146;. She &#145;didn't really like writing&#146;, she said; and only wrote when she felt there was &#145;something which simply had to be written&#146;. Then one day &#145;it just didn't come to me any more&#146;. She once told Neil Gunn that she really wasn't a &#145;literary person&#146;: &#145;there's a great big bit of me detached and amused, and quite often cynical, that weighs the wind of the spirit with the weights of corn and potatoes and things&#146;  (F. R. Hart and J. B. Pick, <span class="italic">Neil M. Gunn: a Highland Life</span>, 1981). The pragmatic romanticism this comment (and all her work) reveals is right at the heart of twentieth-century Scottish fiction. Her complex and remarkable novels were forgotten after their publication, and Shepherd remembered as a prescient critic of Hugh MacDiarmid and a correspondent with Neil Gunn, until the reprinting of her work in the 1980s and 1990s showed her to be a forerunner of Lewis Grassic Gibbon, a quiet pioneer of narrative structure, and one of Scotland's finest novelists of the early twentieth century.<br>
<br>After years of teaching, encouraging, and tending others (her invalid mother died when Shepherd was sixty, after which she nursed their old housekeeper, Mamie Lawson, until she died in the early 1970s), Nan Shepherd became ill in her late eighties and lived for some time at the nursing home Annesley House, in Torphins. She died in Aberdeen at Woodend Hospital on 27 February 1981, at the age of eighty-eight.<br>
