<span class="headword">Peel,  William Robert Wellesley</span>, first Earl Peel  (1867&#150;1937), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 7 January 1867, the eldest of the four sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35450/', "Arthur Wellesley Peel, first Viscount Peel (1829&#150;1912)")</script>, and his wife, Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of William Stratford Dugdale, of Merevale Hall, Warwickshire. His paternal grandfather was the prime minister Sir Robert Peel. His early years were spent in London and at The Lodge, Sandy, Bedfordshire; he was educated at Harrow School (1880?&#150;1885) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1885&#150;9). A contemporary recalled his youthful &#145;impression of high abilities, coupled with a relative indifference to school or university successes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Sept 1937, 14c). He gained second classes in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i>, and was secretary of the Oxford Union and a member of the university dramatic society. In 1893 Peel was called to the bar by the Inner Temple and for the next few years went on circuit, sometimes acting as marshal to Roland Vaughan Williams. In 1897 he was a special correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> in the Graeco-Turkish war; this gave him his first experience of foreign affairs, which remained a lifelong interest. On 11 April 1899 he married the Hon. Eleanor (Ella), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38134/', "James Williamson, first Baron Ashton")</script>. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Peel gained his first experience of public affairs as a member of the royal commission on the port of London, which reported in June 1902. In 1900 he began a long connection with London county council, sitting from 1900 to 1904 as a Municipal Reform Party member for Woolwich, from 1907 to 1910 for Westminster, and from 1913 to 1919 for Kennington. He was leader of the Municipal Reform Party from 1908 to 1910, and chairman of the county council from 1914 to 1916. Meanwhile he entered parliament as Liberal Unionist member for Manchester South following a by-election on 25 May 1900. In January 1906 he unsuccessfully contested Harrow, but he returned to parliament as member for Taunton following a by-election on 23 February 1909, and held his seat through both elections of 1910. He was elevated to the House of Lords following the death of his father on 24 October 1912.<br>
<br>Peel was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Bedfordshire yeomanry in 1912. He served with his regiment in France in 1914&#150;15 and was mentioned in dispatches, but he was obliged to relinquish this post in 1915 owing to ill health. He entered office as joint parliamentary secretary to Sir Auckland Geddes at the national service department, on 15 April 1918. On 10 October the following year he became under-secretary of state for war under Winston Churchill, and was sworn of the privy council. On 1 April 1921 he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to which post was added that of minister of transport on 7 November 1921.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1922 Peel entered the cabinet as secretary of state for India, a position he held until January 1924; he served initially under Lloyd George in his coalition government and then, having been one of those tories who in October 1922 had indicated a willingness to join a purely tory government, held office under Bonar Law and Baldwin. He owed his appointment to Austen Chamberlain's recommendation, and to the back-bench Conservative demand for a period of calm at the India Office, following the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms, the first non-co-operation movement, and Gandhi's imprisonment. One of Peel's first published dispatches set out his reasons for rejecting any further inquiry into constitutional reform. In other respects his tenure was characterized by a policy of &#145;safety first&#146;, although it was also noted for the appointment of the commission on the superior services in India under Lord Lee of Fareham, which led to a significant increase in the number of Indians employed in the Indian Civil Service.<br>
<br>Peel was appointed first commissioner of works in Baldwin's second government, on 10 November 1924, and served in that post for almost four years. During his years at that department he pursued established policies. On 10 October 1928 Peel again became secretary of state for India, following the resignation of Lord Birkenhead. His second term lasted only seven months, and was marked by a determination to maintain a steady course while the commission under Lord Simon was still in progress. In opposition after June 1929 he led an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Baldwin to oppose the declaration made by Lord Irwin on 31 October 1929, and as one of the Conservative delegates at the first Indian round-table conference in 1930&#150;31 he fought a rearguard action in favour of the proposals of the Simon report. From 1931 to 1932 he was chairman of the more congenial Burma round-table conference, his skills as chairman bringing praise from all quarters. In 1933 he was to have chaired the joint select committee on Indian constitutional reforms, but illness prevented him, and he served only briefly as a member. Although he was increasingly out of favour with the Indian policy of the National Government, he dissociated himself from Churchill's campaign against the 1935 reforms.<br>
<br>Peel last held major office as lord privy seal, from 3 September to 5 November 1931. In May 1932 he was appointed chairman of the wheat commission, and in November 1934 he was appointed chairman of the royal commission on the dispatch of business at common law. His last public service was as chairman of the royal commission on Palestine, appointed in July 1936. After investigations on the spot, which put great strain on Peel's ailing health, the commission unanimously recommended cutting the Gordian knot of Arab&#150;Jewish conflict by the drastic means of partition, leaving Jerusalem, the Holy Places, and Haifa as a buffer zone under British control. The commission's report, published in July 1937, met with a chorus of approval from the British press, but with hostility from both Arabs and Jews. Its recommendations were quietly dropped.<br>
<br>Although politics and public life were his overriding concerns, Peel also had extensive business interests. He succeeded as chairman of James Williamson &amp; Co. on the death of his father-in-law in 1929; he was also a director of Barclays Bank and of the Great Northern Railway. He was created Earl Peel and Viscount Clanfield on 10 July 1929. For his services in the First World War he was awarded the American Distinguished Service Medal. He was appointed GBE in 1919 and GCSI in 1932. Peel was described as &#145;a big man, his most conspicuous features being his bright blue eyes and his thick moustache, which became the joy of the caricaturist&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His shrewdness, geniality, and sense of humour were appreciated by his contemporaries. Lord Lytton described him in 1925 as &#145;a good fellow with plenty of common sense&#146;  (Bridge, 12).<br>
<br>Peel died at his home, Leydene, East Meon, Petersfield, Hampshire, on 28 September 1937, and was buried on 2 October at East Meon church. His wife died in 1949. He was succeeded in his titles by his son.<br>
