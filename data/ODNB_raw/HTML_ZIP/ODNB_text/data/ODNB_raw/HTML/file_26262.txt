</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanley,  Edward</span>, third earl of Derby  (1509&#150;1572), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 10 May 1509, probably at Lathom House, Lancashire; he was the second but eldest surviving son of Thomas Stanley, second earl of Derby (<i>b</i>. before 1485, <i>d</i>. 1521), and his wife, Anne Hastings (<i>d</i>. 1550). The second earl, the son of George Stanley (<i>c</i>.1460&#150;1503) and Joan Strange (<i>d</i>. 1514), heir of the barony of Strange of Knockin, had succeeded his grandfather Thomas Stanley, first earl of Derby (<i>c</i>.1433&#150;1504). He served on Henry VIII's French expedition of 1513, but also incurred royal displeasure by excessive self-assertion in Lancashire, for instance an invasion of Furness Abbey in 1514. In 1520 he was sworn of the council, but he died on 23 May 1521 and was buried at Syon Abbey, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Thomas Wolsey had considered the second earl a potential opponent. His heir now became Wolsey's ward and accompanied the cardinal on his French embassy of 1527. Wolsey reputedly took over &pound;5500 from the estates, while rent evasion grew. At his majority Derby had to raise capital by increasing renewal fines but conceding long leases with low rents. After Wolsey's fall the remaining year of Derby's wardship was bought for 3500 marks by Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk (1473&#150;1554); according to a royal pardon of February 1530, he was &#145;abducted&#146; and married to &#145;Katharine, daughter of the said Thomas&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 4, pt 3, no. 2810); a statute later that year assured the dower of Derby's wife, Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk (1443&#150;1524), and his second wife, Agnes Tilney (<i>d</i>. 1545). Strained attempts have long been made to conflate these Howard wives, but the reports of the Spanish ambassador confirm that Derby had married the third duke's daughter by 9 December 1529, that she died on 15 March 1530, and that by October Norfolk, desperate not to lose his outlay, was begging &#145;the nuncio to obtain dispensation for one of his sisters to marry the earl of Dalbi, who had been formerly married to one of his daughters&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1529&#150;30</i>, p. 762). Derby and Dorothy Howard had three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26272/', "Henry Stanley, fourth earl of Derby (1531&#150;1593)")</script>, Sir Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1576), and Sir Edward (<i>d</i>. 1609), and four daughters, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1602), Jane (<i>d</i>. 1569), Mary (<i>d</i>. 1609), and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1589&times;91), all of whom married minor peers, mostly religious conservatives: respectively Charles, Baron Stourton (<i>d</i>. 1557), Edward, Baron Dudley (<i>d</i>. 1586), Edward, Baron Stafford (1536&#150;1603), and Henry Parker, Baron Morley (1532&#150;1577).<br>
<br>Later Derby married Margaret Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1559), daughter of Ellis Barlow of Barlow, Lancashire, and Anne Reddish, and they had one son and two daughters. His last (childless) marriage was to Mary Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter of Sir George Cotton of Combermere, Cheshire (formerly governor to Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, and then to Prince Edward), and Mary Onley. Derby's widow subsequently married Henry Grey, fifth earl of Kent (1541&#150;1615).<br>
<br>Derby received livery of his estates in 1531, when he was already sitting in the Reformation Parliament, having signed the peers' petition to Pope Clement VII to grant Henry VIII's divorce in July 1530. He attended Henry to meet Fran&ccedil;ois I at Boulogne in 1532, was made knight of the Bath on 30 May 1533 before Anne Boleyn's coronation, and acted as cup-bearer on the occasion itself, thus being officially associated with Henry's change of queens. A papal report of 1538 ranked Derby as &#145;the greatest of power and land&#146; among the English nobility, but &#145;young, and a child in wisdom, and half a fool&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 13, pt 2, no. 280). Henry VIII's limited regard may be implied by Derby's failure until immediately after the king's death either to be chosen knight of the Garter (17 February 1547), despite repeated nominations, or to obtain his request for his local dissolved monastery of Burscough.<br>
<br>Derby had performed equivocally in 1536 during the great crisis of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Risings in adjacent counties spilled over into north and north-east Lancashire, but Derby was able to retain the loyalty of most of the county and in late October was preparing to move into the West Riding to suppress Sawley Abbey when word of the Pontefract agreement immobilized the opposing forces. He has been reproached for slowness, but most other peers (even Norfolk) failed to move offensively against the rebels at all. After further unrest Derby and Robert Radcliffe, earl of Sussex (1483&#150;1542), widower of his sister Margaret Stanley, were jointly appointed lieutenants in Lancashire, to avenge rebellion and conclude the monastic dissolutions. In 1542 Derby served in Norfolk's Scottish campaign.<br>
<br>Derby had common religious ground with the pilgrims; but, formerly a multiple monastic steward, he was able to turn pragmatically to acquiring former monastic property in Staffordshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, and Shropshire. Though he missed the Lords bill of attainder against Thomas Cromwell, he voted for the six articles in 1540. In Edward VI's reign he repeatedly entered dissents against legislation of a protestant tendency&#151;the bills of uniformity (January 1549), against old books and images (January 1550), and for the marriage of priests (February 1552), and the new uniformity bill (April 1552).<br>
<br>Derby was particularly suspected by the Edwardian regime because of his autonomous control of the Isle of Man, including the church and a permanent garrison. A report sent from Flanders to Rome in June 1550 claimed that, having refused &#145;to renounce his title of the Isle of Man&#146;, he would resist by force  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1547&#150;53</i>, pp. 119&#150;20). Escalating rumour during 1550&#150;51 linked the reluctance to come to court of Derby and Francis Talbot, fifth earl of Shrewsbury, with the probability of a Catholic rising in the north-west. They were alleged to be intriguing with Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, against his supplanter, John Dudley, earl of Warwick, later duke of Northumberland. During the summer of 1551, however, Warwick managed to regain at least the acquiescence of the northern earls. On 9 August Derby, like Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, was given &#145;peculiarly limited membership&#146; of the privy council, attending only when called by the full councillors  (Hoak, 69)&#151;this associated him with the prohibition of Catholic service for Princess Mary then issued. In December Derby's heir, Henry, Lord Strange (along with Arundel again), was called as a witness to Somerset's treasonable propositions; Northumberland thought it prudent not to charge Strange himself, while Derby was empanelled for the trial.<br>
<br>Appointed lord lieutenant of Lancashire on 16 May 1552, Derby concentrated on local duties. Thus he avoided signing the letters patent for Jane Grey's succession, though Strange did, and on Edward VI's death he raised support for Mary in Cheshire. He was then made a full member of the privy council (17 August 1553) and acted as high steward for Mary's coronation, bearing a sword (as he had at Edward's). He was a commissioner for Edmund Bonner's restoration as bishop of London and for the trial of Jane Grey. He also took at least a local interest in the prosecution of heretics. George Marsh was imprisoned and interrogated at Lathom House. The fact that John Bradford was a native of Manchester made Derby pay some attention, although he was imprisoned in London; while complaining that Bradford was dispatching subversive letters into his home county, the earl's main role was unsuccessfully to seek his recantation, sending him a succession of Catholic churchmen. Derby, &#145;particularly remarkable among the nobility because of his great popular following&#146;, also participated in the defeat of Wyatt's rebellion  (MacCulloch, 284).<br>
<br>Although initially reported to be an opponent, Derby took a prime ceremonial role for Mary's marriage to Philip of Spain, meeting him on landing (20 July 1554) and being one of the five to give the bride away five days later. He was one of the four earls receiving the largest Spanish pension (&pound;500), who were rumoured, probably wrongly, to favour crowning Philip. Proposals that Philip should have the council reduced in size would have involved discarding Derby. Strange, made a gentleman of Philip's chamber, reacted by repeatedly fighting Spaniards. Derby did not receive much material generosity from Mary, but was an executor of her will.<br>
<br>After Elizabeth I's accession she and Derby inclined to uneasy accommodation. He was retained as a privy councillor, and this time did not dissent from a protestant religious settlement&#151;he did not attend the House of Lords after 9 March 1559 and gave his proxy to his protestant fellow councillor Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford. In June 1559 he was also a royal visitor for the northern province and in July 1562 an ecclesiastical commissioner for the diocese of Chester. He was chamberlain of the county palatine of Chester from 1559 to 1565, when supplanted by the regional empire-builder Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and successfully defended palatine jurisdiction against the exchequer and admiralty courts. Derby still retained considerable influence in Lancashire parliamentary elections, checking that of the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Derby accepted the obligations of public office, but acted slowly and reluctantly against Catholics, and against relatively unimportant ones at that. He harboured the papal agent Nicholas Morton in 1569, and the northern rebels of that year hoped for his support. Elizabeth suspected him, but retained him as lord lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire: in the event he wisely stood on the sidelines. Plots to free Mary, queen of Scots, from Tutbury implicated Derby's younger sons, Edward and Thomas, but not Derby or his heir.<br>
<br>Derby died at Lathom House on 24 October 1572 and was buried with great magnificence on 4 December in Ormskirk parish church, where a chapel and monumental tomb were built. His funeral reflected his penchant for somewhat old-fashioned aristocratic display. He was noted for hospitality, supposedly feeding sixty poor every day and 2700 on Good Friday; his house was a centre of social and cultural life called &#145;The Northern Circuit&#146;  (Seacome, <span class="italic">House of Derby</span>, 154).<br>
<br>Derby had retained extensive property, patronage, and influence in north-west England, albeit limited by the growth of a protestant society in the region, which ultimately extended to his protestant heir. By 1569, as Sir Francis Leek wrote, &#145;all the keys of Lancashire do not hang at the earl of Derby's old girdle&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1566&#150;79</i>, p. 159). Allegedly &#145;half a fool&#146; in the 1530s and again reported to Rome in 1567 as &#145;not so prudent as potent&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Rome</span>, <i>1558&#150;71</i>, p. 265), Derby's resilience through the tumultuous mid-sixteenth century suggests &#145;some political wisdom, for which he has not always been given credit&#146;  (Coward, &#145;A &#147;crisis of the aristocracy&#148;&#146;, 66). Arguably in 1536 as much as in 1569 he was successfully &#145;emulating his ancestors in the Wars of the Roses &hellip; by playing a waiting game&#146;  (Haigh, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 74).<br>
