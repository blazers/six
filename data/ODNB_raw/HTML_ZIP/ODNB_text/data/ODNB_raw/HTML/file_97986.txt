<span class="headword">Vitr&eacute;,  Barbara Mary  Denis de</span>  (1905&#150;1960), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Eling Farm, Hampstead Norris, Berkshire, on 6 November 1905, the youngest daughter of George Theodosius Denis de Vitr&eacute; (1861/2&#150;1932), estate manager, and his wife, Harriet Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beeching (1866&#150;1955). After a boarding-school education at St Felix, Southwold, she studied social welfare work at the University of Manchester before undertaking a six-week course in police work under the auspices of the Women's Auxiliary Service led by Mary S. Allen.<br>
<br>In October 1928 Denis de Vitr&eacute;, or de Vitr&eacute;, as she was usually known, joined Sheffield city police force, serving under Captain Percy Sillitoe, one of a small number of chief constables who were then enthusiastic about the appointment of women as attested officers. In 1931 she was appointed head constable for women in Cairo city police; her duties included the regulation of the city's brothels as well as the registration of prostitutes, undercover work for the narcotics bureau, and training Egyptian policewomen. In 1933 she returned to England to succeed Eileen Claire Sloane as Leicester's second policewoman. She was promoted sergeant in 1936. In 1937 she organized the first Provincial Policewomen's Conference, held in Leicester and attended by 36 women delegates from 26 different police forces. This was approximately half of all &#145;provincial&#146; policewomen, who were mainly employed in twos or threes in urban forces (the conference did not include women from the Metropolitan Police, who already formed an establishment of 97). At the conference dinner a toast was made to &#145;the wartime women police&#146;, responded to by Mary Allen. De Vitr&eacute; was called upon to respond to a further toast to &#145;the women police of today&#146;, demonstrating her increasingly significant profile nationally. In 1944 she transferred to Kent constabulary. Sir Percy Sillitoe, her former boss, had recently been appointed as the chief and wanted to create a new policewomen's department, which he chose her to head. Within ten months the women's establishment had increased from 2 to 179, including wartime auxiliaries as well as regulars  (Sillitoe, 172).<br>
<br>On 1 April 1945 de Vitr&eacute; moved to the Home Office to assist the inspectors of constabularies with the inspection of all provincial policewomen and the monitoring of their duties and conditions of service, as well as advising chief constables and civil servants on the training and deployment of women. Since the 1920s women's organizations had joined with women MPs to campaign for the employment of women in all police forces and for the appointment of a woman to work with inspectors of constabularies. This demand was finally accepted by the home secretary, Herbert Morrison; de Vitr&eacute; was appointed first as staff officer and, from 1948, as assistant inspector of constabularies (with responsibility for the inspection of all policewomen's departments), the highest rank available to women in the police service. The work undertaken by women during wartime had clearly been recognized; yet it was perceived by many to be for &#145;the duration&#146; only and it was not assured when war ended. De Vitr&eacute; used her position at the Home Office not only to promote women's employment but also to expand the range of duties and responsibilities in which they were involved. She did so with indefatigable enthusiasm. Contemporaries commented on the importance of her charm, tact, and strength of character in persuading chief constables and police authorities to expand their use of women officers. Sir William Johnson, inspector of constabularies, wrote: &#145;fine and sincere without any pretence, she won people by sheer force of her personality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 19 Aug 1960). Between 1945 and 1960 the number of women employed in English, Welsh, and Scottish police forces increased from 445 to 2500. De Vitr&eacute; was appointed OBE in 1951.<br>
<br>Known affectionately as Miss de V among policewomen, de Vitr&eacute;'s significance also lies in the support she provided for her colleagues. She has been described as &#145;probably the most popular senior woman police officer the service has produced&#146;  (Lock, 187). De Vitr&eacute;'s recognition of the need for policewomen to come together as a professional community, sharing good practice as well as sociability, was demonstrated in her revival of policewomen's conferences (organized by the Home Office from 1947 onwards) for each of the districts within England, Scotland, and Wales.<br>
<br>De Vitr&eacute;'s approach to policing is best characterized as a vocation, based on commitment to public duty and service. Although she had been trained by the controversial Mary Allen, who was associated with militant suffrage (and later the British Union of Fascists), de Vitr&eacute; preferred not to draw attention to this link. Like many of her contemporaries, she argued that policewomen had a special role to play in dealing with women and child victims and offenders; but she also encouraged chief constables to deploy women across a broad range of uniformed and plain-clothes duties, criticizing those who restricted their role to office work. While the marriage bar (which required women to leave the service on marriage) had been lifted in England and Wales in 1946, it continued to operate in Scotland; de Vitr&eacute; vociferously opposed its retention. In 1954 she wrote to Sir Charles Cunningham, permanent under-secretary at the Scottish Office, of her concerns that Scottish policewomen were &#145;the only women so discriminated against and I feel so strongly that we should establish the principle of their individual freedom&#146;  (NA Scot., HH55/776). The argument was only won beyond her lifetime; the Scottish marriage bar was finally removed in 1968. While she avoided the rhetoric of feminism publicly, her aim was to enable all women officers to realize their full potential for the benefit of the service as a whole.<br>
<br>De Vitr&eacute; died of cancer at her home, 7 Palace Street, Westminster, London, on 8 August 1960. In her role as assistant inspector of constabularies she was succeeded by Kathleen M. Hill who had worked with her closely at the Home Office since 1945. She did not marry and had no children.<br>
