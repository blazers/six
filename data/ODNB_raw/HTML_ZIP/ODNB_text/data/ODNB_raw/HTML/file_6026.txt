<span class="headword">Comerford,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1832), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of a flax-dresser. He acquired some of his knowledge of painting by copying pictures in Kilkenny Castle, then one of the finest collections of portraits in Ireland, where he would have seen works by Sir Godfrey Kneller and Sir Peter Lely. He was educated at the Dublin Society's drawing schools during the mid-1780s and on 13 May 1790 was recommended for a certificate testifying to his &#145;extraordinary merit in drawing from the flat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society</span>, 26, 1789&#150;90, 122). On 7 April 1791 he received a silver medal in the first class for drawing a single figure from nature  (ibid., 27, 1790&#150;91, 81). Comerford divided his time between Kilkenny and Dublin. An advertisement appeared in Finn's <span class="italic">Leinster Journal</span> on 13 September 1797: &#145;Likenesses in Oils and Miniature by J. Comerford who has arrived in Kilkenny for a short time at Mr. Comerford's opposite the Tholsel.&#146; In 1799 Comerford met George Chinnery and afterwards adopted a variation of Chinnery's style of miniature painting. Encouraged by Chinnery, he abandoned oil portraiture and concentrated on miniature painting for the rest of his career. Working in watercolour on ivory, using loose brushstrokes, Comerford's miniatures are relatively large and are well drawn. The features of his sitters are modelled using brown shading with a hint of blue in the darkest areas. A representative example of his miniature style is his portrait of <span class="italic">Judge Walter MacGuire</span>, painted in Dublin in 1818 (V&amp;A, MacGuire loan) . Chinnery helped to organize the Society of Artists of Ireland exhibition held in 1800, in which Comerford first exhibited in Dublin. A review of Comerford's work stated: &#145;Comerford seems to play with his art in all the strength, the ease and the variety of the most vigorous and commanding genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span>, 11 May 1802). Comerford lived with the Chinnerys at 27 Dame Street, College Green, Dublin, from 1800. In 1815 he moved to 2 Leinster Street, and shortly before his death he moved to 28 Blessington Street.<br>
<br>When Comerford sent miniatures to the exhibition at the Parliament House in 1802, his work was praised again and he was referred to as &#145;bursting at once from provincial retirement into the full blaze of public notice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Evening Post</span>, 17 June 1802). He continued to exhibit miniatures at the Society of Artists of Ireland exhibitions in 1800, 1801, 1802, 1804, and 1810, and at the Irish Society of Artists in 1812 and 1813. In 1811 he was elected to the committee of the Irish Society of Artists and became its vice-president. In 1804 and 1809 he exhibited three portraits at the Royal Academy in London. From 1800, when Comerford first exhibited, until 1823 exhibitions were held by a plethora of societies of artists in Ireland such as the Society of Artists of Ireland, who were continually re-forming as different groups. In 1823 the granting of a charter to the Royal Hibernian Academy did not go without opposition, led by Comerford, who strongly disagreed with the granting of a charter of incorporation for the formation of an academy of artists.<br>
<br>According to T. J. Mulvany, Comerford accumulated a considerable fortune:<blockquote>although of sufficiently prudent turn of mind to amass a very handsome fortune, having left, it is said &pound;16,000 after him, [he] still enjoyed the fruits of fortune during his life and as easy circumstances rendered too great devotion to his profession unnecessary, he delighted to relax in the Society of his friends, among whom were included all the distinguished artists of the day. (Gandon and Mulvany, 152&#150;4)</blockquote>Among these were the history painter Vincent Waldr&eacute; (<i>c</i>.1742&#150;1814) and William Ashford (1746&#150;1824), the first president of the Royal Hibernian Academy. Comerford often collaborated with Thomas Sautell Roberts (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1826), adding the figures or portraits to Roberts's landscapes, as in, for example, <span class="italic">View of Powerscourt, with a Portrait of Captain Taylor of the Engineers</span> and <span class="italic">View in the Valley of Glencree, with a Portrait of the Earl of Hardwicke, Lord Lieutenant</span> (exh. Dublin, 1802).<br>
<br>The miniaturist Samuel Lover (1797&#150;1868) was greatly influenced by Comerford, whom he met in the early 1820s, and by whom he was encouraged to paint miniatures early in his career. His pupil John Doyle (1797&#150;1868) started his career as a miniaturist before becoming a highly successful caricaturist. Thomas Clement Thompson (1778&times;80&#150;1857) was also taught to paint miniatures by Comerford.<br>
<br>While on a visit to T. J. Mulvany at Lucan, co. Dublin, in 1829 Comerford had a seizure. His life was saved by Dr Fergusson of Leixlip and he lived to resume his profession for three more years. He died on 25 January 1832 at his home in Blessington Street, Dublin, leaving an only daughter, Mary, to whom he bequeathed &pound;500 a year. A prolific miniaturist, Comerford's work is easily identified as he usually signed and dated his portraits in full. The National Gallery of Ireland has a large collection of his work; others are in the Victoria and Albert Museum and at Kenwood House, London.<br>
