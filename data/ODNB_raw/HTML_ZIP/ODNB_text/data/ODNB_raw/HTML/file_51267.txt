<span class="headword">Oliver,  Stephen Michael Harding</span>  (1950&#150;1992), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 10 March 1950 at Chester Nursing Home, the last of the three children of Osborne George Oliver (<i>b</i>. 1903), an electricity board official, and his wife, (Charlotte) Hester, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Girdlestone (<i>b</i>. 1911), an adviser in religious education. Although Oliver became an agnostic the Christian ethic informed everything he did, and he was to write much sacred music. While a chorister at St Paul's choir school he discovered, in <span class="italic">The Mikado</span>, his empathy with secular music drama. He wrote his first opera at the age of twelve and never stopped. Works, including his earliest oratorio, followed at Ardingly College. But it was his opera <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span> (1972), performed while he was at Worcester College, Oxford (from which he graduated BA in 1971 and BMus in 1972), that told the outside world of the arrival of a new theatre composer to be reckoned with. His successful output was such that, after two years spent teaching composition and music history at Huddersfield Polytechnic, he was able to move to London, proud to be a full-time professional.<br>
<br>Oliver regarded himself as a craftsman&#151;someone in the line of eighteenth-century composers who would undertake any commissioned work. He wrote fast, with a facility for inventing the widest ranges of sounds, from pastiche of any century's characteristics to his personal contemporary &#145;squeaky-gate&#146; music, with anything from Messiaen-scale orchestration to miniatures for lute and viola da gamba, or simply a tray of wine glasses. He composed for every facet of entertainment: film (<span class="italic">Lady Jane Grey</span>), dance (<span class="italic">La bella Rosina</span>), radio (incidental music for <span class="italic">The Lord of the Rings</span>), television (much of the BBC Shakespeare series), and straight theatre (some ninety plays, many for the Royal Shakespeare Company, including scores for <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> and <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span>). <span class="italic">Blondel</span>, the musical he wrote with Tim Rice, was not quite a success, though it ran in London for a year, and one song, &#145;Running Back for More&#146;, reached the pop charts. The Thatcherite certainties of Rice's lyrics did not blend happily with Oliver's angst.<br>
<br>It was in opera that Oliver found his most rewarding outlet. Although occasionally he devised his own storyline (<span class="italic">Il giardino</span>, 1977, <span class="italic">Exposition of a Picture</span>, 1986, and his version of Mozart's <span class="italic">L'oca del Cairo</span>, 1991), usually the texts Oliver wrote, and set to music, were drawn from his dauntingly deep knowledge of literature: Webster, Dickens (<span class="italic">Perseverance</span>, 1974), Beckett (<span class="italic">Past Tense</span>, 1974), Fielding (<span class="italic">Tom Jones</span>, 1976), Yeats (<span class="italic">The Dreaming of the Bones</span>, 1979), Schnitzler (<span class="italic">A Man of Feeling</span>, 1980), Ostrovsky (<span class="italic">Sasha</span>, 1984), de Beaumont (<span class="italic">La bella e la bestia</span>, 1984), Mann (<span class="italic">Mario ed il mago</span>, 1988), and Shakespeare (<span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span>, 1991). The theatrical effectiveness of these operas was perfectly judged. They enjoyed naturalistic word-setting, melody in tonal but contemporary idiom, and audacious orchestration, frequently making use of the marimba and a battery of other percussion instruments. The smaller scale works were particularly successful, the clarity and delicacy of chamber music bringing out the best in Oliver. Many of them used an uneasy, tentative 3/4 time to suggest the malaise of the principal characters. Although he was at ease with his homosexuality and did not see himself as an outsider, the composer's own (quite unjustified) feelings of inadequacy were put to good use in some of the best roles he created: the Beast, Cipolla, and Timon. The need for friendship was a theme that ran through his work, and he was the first to see that the hero's relationship with Smike should be at the core of <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>.<br>
<br>Oliver was the acknowledged star of the <span class="italic">South Bank Show</span> on the making of <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>, that great Royal Shakespeare Company success; the television public met for the first time the brilliant conversationalist and (occasionally) caustic wit. This was followed by <span class="italic">Understanding Opera</span>, a slightly didactic series he wrote and presented for BBC2 television. He had dexterity with words both written and spoken. His translations of other men's operas included <span class="italic">Euridice</span>, <span class="italic">Orlando</span>, <span class="italic">Le coq d'or</span>, and <span class="italic">The King Goes Forth</span>. He would review a concert for the BBC in rhyming couplets, and frequently had his listeners in stitches on Radio 4's <span class="italic">Stop the Week</span>. He was also an excellent actor. But the dazzling exterior hid a serious, public-spirited man who served on many committees, among them the boards of English National Opera (where he brought commission fees up to date) and the Performing Right Society (where he led the campaign to give lyricists parity with composers). Privately he led an almost (but not quite) monk-like existence, preferring to live undisturbed and alone, spending little on himself and, instead, redirecting his earnings to small, struggling opera companies and a variety of charities. He had, in the fullest measure, the gift of unassailable friendship, and was always ready with advice, help, and, often, hard cash where it was needed. A typical act of sacrifice, despite his need of privacy for composing, was to give a final home to a close friend dying of AIDS.<br>
<br>In the last year of his life, before he was stricken by the same virus, Oliver achieved an astounding compositional <i>tour de force</i> which included an oratorio (<span class="italic">The Vessel</span>), new recitatives for the Glyndebourne production of <span class="italic">La clemenza di Tito</span>, and two operas (<span class="italic">Timon of Athens</span> for the English National Opera and <span class="italic">L'oca del Cairo</span> for the Batignano festival), all in 1991. He bore his last illness with exemplary courage and optimism, and died at his home, Flat B, 44 Queensgate, London, on 29 April 1992. His ashes were scattered at his request in the olive grove of the ex-monastery of Santa Croce, Batignano, Italy, where four of his works were first staged. He left the bulk of his estate in trust to further new opera.<br>
